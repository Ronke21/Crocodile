<text>Since ancient times, Greeks, Etruscans and Celts have inhabited the south, centre and north of the Italian peninsula respectively. The very numerous rock drawings in Valcamonica are as old as 8,000 BC, and there are rich remains of Etruscan art from thousands of tombs, as well as rich remains from the Greek colonies at Paestum, Agrigento and elsewhere. Ancient Rome finally emerged as the dominant Italian and European power. The Roman remains in Italy are of extraordinary richness, from the grand Imperial monuments of Rome itself to the survival of exceptionally preserved ordinary buildings in Pompeii and neighbouring sites. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, in the Middle Ages Italy remained an important centre, not only of the Carolingian art, Ottonian art of the Holy Roman Emperors, Norman art, but for the Byzantine art of Ravenna and other sites.

Italy was the main centre of artistic developments throughout the Renaissance (1300–1600), beginning with the Proto-Renaissance of Giotto and reaching a particular peak in the High Renaissance of Antonello da Messina, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael, whose works inspired the later phase of the Renaissance, known as Mannerism. Italy retained its artistic dominance into the 17th century with the Baroque (1600–1750), and into the 18th century with Neoclassicism (1750–1850). In this period, cultural tourism became a major prop to Italian economy. Both Baroque and Neoclassicism originated in Rome and spread to all Western art. Italy maintained a presence in the international art scene from the mid-19th century onwards, with movements such as the Macchiaioli, Futurism, Metaphysical, Novecento Italiano, Spatialism, Arte Povera, and Transavantgarde.
Italian art has influenced several major movements throughout the centuries and has produced several great artists, including painters, architects and sculptors. Today, Italy has an important place in the international art scene, with several major art galleries, museums and exhibitions; major artistic centres in the country include Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Turin, Genoa, Naples, Palermo, Syracuse and other cities. Italy is home to 60 World Heritage Sites, the largest number of any country in the world.

== Etruscan art ==


Etruscan bronze figures and a terracotta funerary reliefs include examples of a vigorous Central Italian tradition which had waned by the time Rome began building her empire on the peninsula.

The Etruscan paintings that have survived to modern times are mostly wall frescoes from graves, and mainly from Tarquinia. These are the most important example of pre-Roman figurative art in Italy known to scholars.
The frescoes consist of painting on top of fresh plaster, so that when the plaster is dried the painting becomes part of the plaster and an integral part of the wall, which helps it survive so well (indeed, almost all of surviving Etruscan and Roman painting is in fresco). Colours were made from stones and minerals in different colours that ground up and mixed in a medium, and fine brushes were made of animal hair (even the best brushes are produced with ox hair). From the mid 4th century BC chiaroscuro began to be used to portray depth and volume. Sometimes scenes of everyday life are portrayed, but more often traditional mythological scenes. The concept of proportion does not appear in any surviving frescoes and we frequently find portrayals of animals or men with some body-parts out of proportion. One of the best-known Etruscan frescoes is that of Tomb of the Lioness at Tarquinia.

== Roman art ==

The Etruscans were responsible for constructing Rome&#x27;s earliest monumental buildings. Roman temples and houses were closely based on Etruscan models. Elements of Etruscan influence in Roman temples included the podium and the emphasis on the front at the expense of the remaining three sides. Large Etruscan houses were grouped around a central hall in much the same way as Roman town Large houses were later built around an &quot;atrium&quot;. The influence of Etruscan architecture gradually declined during the republic in the face of influences (particularly Greek) from elsewhere. The Etruscan architecture was itself influenced by the Greeks so that when the Romans adopted Greek styles, it was not a totally alien culture. During the republic, there was probably a steady absorption of architectural influences, mainly from the Hellenistic world, but after the fall of Syracuse in 211 BC, Greek works of art flooded into Rome. During the 2nd century BC, the flow of these works, and more important, Greek craftsmen, continued, thus decisively influencing the development of Roman architecture. By the end of the republic, when Vitruvius wrote his treatise on architecture, Greek architectural theory and example were dominant. With the expansion of the empire, Roman architecture spread over a wide area, used for both public buildings and some larger private ones. In many areas, elements of style were influenced by local tastes, particularly decoration, but the architecture remained recognizably Roman. Styles of vernacular architecture were influenced to varying degrees by Roman architecture, and in many regions, Roman and native elements are found combined in the same building.

By the 1st century AD, Rome had become the biggest and most advanced city in the world. The ancient Romans came up with new technologies to improve the city&#x27;s sanitation systems, roads, and buildings. They developed a system of aqueducts that piped freshwater into the city, and they built sewers that removed the city&#x27;s waste. The wealthiest Romans lived in large houses with gardens. Most of the population, however, lived in apartment buildings made of stone, concrete, or limestone. The Romans developed new techniques and used materials such as volcanic soil from Pozzuoli, a village near Naples, to make their cement harder and stronger. This concrete allowed them to build large apartment buildings called &quot; insulae&quot;.

Wall paintings decorated the houses of the wealthy. Paintings often showed garden landscapes, events from Greek and Roman mythology, historical scenes, or scenes of everyday life. Romans decorated floors with mosaics — pictures or designs created with small colored tiles. The richly colored paintings and mosaics helped to make rooms in Roman houses seem larger and brighter and showed off the wealth of the owner.

In the Christian era of the late Empire, from 350 to 500 AD, wall painting, mosaic ceiling and floor work, and funerary sculpture thrived, while full-sized sculpture in the round and panel painting died out, most likely for religious reasons. When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium (renamed Constantinople), Roman art incorporated Eastern influences to produce the Byzantine style of the late empire. When Rome was sacked in the 5th century, artisans moved to and found work in the Eastern capital. The Church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople employed nearly 10,000 workmen and artisans, in a final burst of Roman art under Emperor Justinian I, who also ordered the creation of the famous mosaics of Ravenna.

== Medieval art ==
Throughout the Middle Ages, Italian art consisted primarily of architectural decorations (frescoes and mosaics). Byzantine art in Italy was a highly formal and refined decoration with standardized calligraphy and admirable use of color and gold. Until the 13th century, art in Italy was almost entirely regional, affected by external European and Eastern currents. After &quot;c.&quot; 1250 the art of the various regions developed characteristics in common, so that a certain unity, as well as great originality, is observable.

=== Italo-Byzantine art ===

With the fall of its western capital, the Roman Empire continued for another 1000 years under the leadership of Constantinople. Byzantine artisans were used in important projects throughout Italy, and what are called Italo-Byzantine styles of painting can be found up to the 14th century.

Italo-Byzantine style initially covers religious paintings copying or imitating the standard Byzantine icon types, but painted by artists without a training in Byzantine techniques. These are versions of Byzantine icons, most of the Madonna and Child, but also of other subjects; essentially they introduced the relatively small portable painting with a frame to Western Europe. Very often they are on a gold ground. It was the dominant style in Italian painting until the end of the 13th century, when Cimabue and Giotto began to take Italian, or at least Florentine, painting into new territory. But the style continued until the 15th century and beyond in some areas and contexts.

=== Duecento ===

Duecento is the Italian term for the culture of the 13th century. The period saw Gothic architecture, which had begun in northern Europe spreading southward to Italy, at least in the north. The Dominican and Franciscan orders of friars, founded by Saint Dominic and Saint Francis of Assisi respectively became popular and well-funded in the period, and embarked on large building programmes, mostly using a cheaper and less highly decorated version of Gothic. Large schemes of fresco murals were cheap, and could be used to instruct congregations. The Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, in effect two large churches, one above the other on a hilly site, is one of the best examples, begun in 1228 and painted with frescos by Cimabue, Giotto, Simone Martini, Pietro Lorenzetti and possibly Pietro Cavallini, most of the leading painters of the period.

===Trecento===

Trecento is the Italian term for the culture of the 14th century. The period is considered to be the beginning of the Italian Renaissance or at least the Proto-Renaissance in art history. Painters of the Trecento included Giotto di Bondone, as well as painters of the Sienese School, which became the most important in Italy during the century, including Duccio di Buoninsegna, Simone Martini, Lippo Memmi, Ambrogio Lorenzetti and his brother Pietro. Important sculptors included two pupils of Giovanni Pisano: Arnolfo di Cambio and Tino di Camaino, and Bonino da Campione.

== Renaissance art ==
During the Middle Ages, painters and sculptors tried to give their works a spiritual quality. They wanted viewers to concentrate on the deep religious meaning of their paintings and sculptures. But Renaissance painters and sculptors, like Renaissance writers, wanted to portray people and nature realistically. Medieval architects designed huge cathedrals to emphasize the grandeur of God and to humble the human spirit. Renaissance architects designed buildings whose proportions were based on those of the human body and whose ornamentation imitated ancient designs.

=== Early Renaissance ===

During the early 14th century, the Florentine painter Giotto became the first artist to portray nature realistically since the fall of the Roman Empire. He produced magnificent frescoes (paintings on damp plaster) for churches in Assisi, Florence, Padua, and Rome. Giotto attempted to create lifelike figures showing real emotions. He portrayed many of his figures in realistic settings.

A remarkable group of Florentine architects, painters, and sculptors worked during the early 15th century. They included the painter Masaccio, the sculptor Donatello, and the architect Filippo Brunelleschi.

Masaccio&#x27;s finest work was a series of frescoes he painted about 1427 in the Brancacci Chapel of the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. The frescoes realistically show Biblical scenes of emotional intensity. In these paintings, Masaccio utilized Brunelleschi&#x27;s system for achieving linear perspective.

In his sculptures, Donatello tried to portray the dignity of the human body in realistic and often dramatic detail. His masterpieces include three statues of the Biblical hero David. In a version finished in the 1430s, Donatello portrayed David as a graceful, nude youth, moments after he slew the giant Goliath. The work, which is about tall, was the first large free-standing nude created in Western art since classical antiquity.

Brunelleschi was the first Renaissance architect to revive the ancient Roman style of architecture. He used arches, columns, and other elements of classical architecture in his designs. One of his best-known buildings is the beautifully and harmoniously proportioned Pazzi Chapel in Florence. The chapel, begun in 1442 and completed about 1465, was one of the first buildings designed in the new Renaissance style. Brunelleschi also was the first Renaissance artist to master &quot;linear perspective&quot;, a mathematical system with which painters could show space and depth on a flat surface.

=== High Renaissance ===
Arts of the late 15th century and early 16th century were dominated by three men. They were Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael.

Leonardo da Vinci painted two of the most famous works of Renaissance art, the wallpainting &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and the portrait &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. Leonardo had one of the most searching minds in all history. He wanted to know how everything that he saw in nature worked. In over 4,000 pages of notebooks, he drew detailed diagrams and wrote his observations. Leonardo made careful drawings of human skeletons and muscles, trying to learn how the body worked. Due to his inquiring mind, Leonardo has become a symbol of the Renaissance spirit of learning and intellectual curiosity.

Michelangelo excelled as a painter, architect, and poet. In addition, he has been called the greatest sculptor in history. Michelangelo was a master of portraying the human figure. For example, his famous statue of the Israelite leader &quot;Moses&quot; (1516) gives an overwhelming impression of physical and spiritual power. These qualities also appear in the frescoes of Biblical and classical subjects that Michelangelo painted on the ceiling of the Vatican&#x27;s Sistine Chapel. The frescoes, painted from 1508 to 1512, rank among the greatest works of Renaissance art.

Raphael&#x27;s paintings are softer in outline and more poetic than those of Michelangelo. Raphael was skilled in creating perspective and in the delicate use of color. He painted a number of pictures of the Madonna (Virgin Mary) and many outstanding portraits. One of his greatest works is the fresco &quot;The School of Athens&quot;. The painting was influenced by classical Greek and Roman models. It portrays the great philosophers and scientists of ancient Greece in a setting of classical arches. Raphael was thus making a connection between the culture of classical antiquity and the Italian culture of his time.

The creator of High Renaissance architecture was Donato Bramante, who came to Rome in 1499, when he was 55. His first Roman masterpiece, the &quot;Tempietto&quot; (1502) at San Pietro in Montorio, is a centralized dome structure that recalls Classical temple architecture. Pope Julius II chose Bramante to be papal architect, and together they devised a plan to replace the 4th-century Old St. Peter&#x27;s with a new church of gigantic dimensions. The project was not completed, however, until long after Bramante&#x27;s death.

=== Mannerism ===

Mannerism was an elegant, courtly style. It flourished in Florence, Italy, where its leading representatives were Giorgio Vasari and Bronzino. The style was introduced to the French court by Rosso Fiorentino and by Francesco Primaticcio. The Venetian painter Tintoretto was influenced by the style.

The mannerist approach to painting also influenced other art forms. In architecture, the work of Giulio Romano is a notable example. The Italian Benvenuto Cellini and Flemish-born Giambologna were the style&#x27;s chief representatives in sculpture.

Some historians regard this period as degeneration of High Renaissance classicism or even as an interlude between High Renaissance and baroque, in which case the dates are usually from &quot;c.&quot; 1520 to 1600, and it is considered a positive style complete in itself.

== Baroque and Rococo art ==

In the early 17th century Rome became the center of a renewal of Italian dominance in the arts. In Parma, Antonio da Correggio decorated church vaults with lively figures floating softly on clouds – a scheme that was to have a profound influence on baroque ceiling paintings. The stormy chiaroscuro paintings of Caravaggio and the robust, illusionistic paintings of the Bolognese Carracci family gave rise to the baroque period in Italian art. Domenichino, Francesco Albani, and later Andrea Sacchi were among those who carried out the classical implications in the art of the Carracci.

On the other hand, Guido Reni, Guercino, Orazio Gentileschi, Giovanni Lanfranco, and later Pietro da Cortona and Andrea Pozzo, while thoroughly trained in a classical-allegorical mode, were at first inclined to paint dynamic compositions full of gesticulating figures in a manner closer to that of Caravaggio. The towering virtuoso of baroque exuberance and grandeur in sculpture and architecture was Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Toward 1640 many of the painters leaned toward the classical style that had been brought to the fore in Rome by the French expatriate Nicolas Poussin. The sculptors Alessandro Algardi and François Duquesnoy also tended toward the classical. Notable late baroque artists include the Genoese Giovanni Battista Gaulli and the Neapolitans Luca Giordano and Francesco Solimena.

The leading lights of the 18th century came from Venice. Among them were the brilliant exponent of the rococo style, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo; the architectural painters Francesco Guardi, Canaletto, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, and Bernardo Bellotto; and the engraver of Roman antiquities, Giovanni Battista Piranesi.

== Neoclassical and 19th-century art ==

Italian Neoclassicism was the earliest manifestation of the general period known as Neoclassicism and lasted more than the other national variants of neoclassicism. It developed in opposition to the Baroque style around c. 1750 and lasted until c. 1850. Neoclassicism began around the period of the rediscovery of Pompeii and spread all over Europe as a generation of art students returned to their countries from the Grand Tour in Italy with rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.

Just like in other parts of Europe, Italian Neoclassical art was mainly based on the principles of Ancient Roman and Ancient Greek art and architecture, but also by the Italian Renaissance architecture and its basics, such as in the Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot;. Classicism and Neoclassicism in Italian art and architecture developed during the Italian Renaissance, notably in the writings and designs of Leon Battista Alberti and the work of Filippo Brunelleschi. 
It places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of Ancient Rome, of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aedicules replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings. This style quickly spread to other Italian cities and later to the rest of continental Europe.

It first centred in Rome where artists such as Antonio Canova and Jacques-Louis David were active in the second half of the 18th century, before moving to Paris. Painters of Vedute, like Canaletto and Giovanni Paolo Panini, also enjoyed a huge success during the Grand Tour. The sculptor Antonio Canova was a leading exponent of the neoclassic style. Internationally famous, he was regarded as the most brilliant sculptor in Europe. Francesco Hayez is the greatest exponent of Romanticism in Italy: many of his works, usually of Medieval setting, contain an encrypted patriotic Risorgimento message. Neoclassicism was the last Italian-born style, after the Renaissance and Baroque, to spread to all Western Art.

=== The Macchiaioli ===

Italy produced its own form of Impressionism, the Macchiaioli artists, who were actually there first, before the more famous Impressionists: Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Telemaco Signorini, Giuseppe Abbati. The Macchiaioli artists were forerunners to Impressionism in France. They believed that areas of light and shadow, or &quot;macchie&quot; (literally patches or spots) were the chief components of a work of art. The word macchia was commonly used by Italian artists and critics in the 19th century to describe the sparkling quality of a drawing or painting, whether due to a sketchy and spontaneous execution or to the harmonious breadth of its overall effect.

A hostile review published on 3 November 1862, in the journal &quot;Gazzetta del Popolo&quot; marks the first appearance in print of the term Macchiaioli. The term carried several connotations: it mockingly implied that the artists&#x27; finished works were no more than sketches, and recalled the phrase &quot;darsi alla macchia&quot;, meaning, idiomatically, to hide in the bushes or scrubland. The artists did, in fact, paint much of their work in these wild areas. This sense of the name also identified the artists with outlaws, reflecting the traditionalists&#x27; view that new school of artists was working outside the rules of art, according to the strict laws defining artistic expression at the time.

== Italian modern and contemporary art ==
Early in the 20th century the exponents of futurism developed a dynamic vision of the modern world while Giorgio de Chirico expressed a strange metaphysical quietude and Amedeo Modigliani joined the school of Paris. Gifted later modern artists include the sculptors Giacomo Manzù, Marino Marini, the still-life painter Giorgio Morandi, and the iconoclastic painter Lucio Fontana. In the second half of the 20th century, Italian designers, particularly those of Milan, have profoundly influenced international styles with their imaginative and ingenious functional works.

=== Futurism ===

Futurism was an Italian art movement that flourished from 1909 to about 1916. It was the first of many art movements that tried to break with the past in all areas of life. Futurism glorified the power, speed, and excitement that characterized the machine age. From the French Cubist painters and multiple-exposure photography, the Futurists learned to break up realistic forms into multiple images and overlapping fragments of color. By such means, they attempted to portray the energy and speed of modern life. In literature, Futurism demanded the abolition of traditional sentence structures and verse forms.

Futurism was first announced on 20 February 1909, when the Paris newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; published a manifesto by the Italian poet and editor Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. (See the Manifesto of Futurism.) Marinetti coined the word Futurism to reflect his goal of discarding the art of the past and celebrating change, originality, and innovation in culture and society. Marinetti&#x27;s manifesto glorified the new technology of the automobile and the beauty of its speed, power, and movement. Exalting violence and conflict, he called for the sweeping repudiation of traditional values and the destruction of cultural institutions such as museums and libraries. The manifesto&#x27;s rhetoric was passionately bombastic; its aggressive tone was purposely intended to inspire public anger and arouse controversy.

Marinetti&#x27;s manifesto inspired a group of young painters in Milan to apply Futurist ideas to the visual arts. Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo, Giacomo Balla, and Gino Severini published several manifestos on painting in 1910. Like Marinetti, they glorified originality and expressed their disdain for inherited artistic traditions.

Boccioni also became interested in sculpture, publishing a manifesto on the subject in the spring of 1912. He is considered to have most fully realized his theories in two sculptures, &quot;Development of a Bottle in Space&quot; (1912), in which he represented both the inner and outer contours of a bottle, and &quot;Unique Forms of Continuity in Space&quot; (1913), in which a human figure is not portrayed as one solid form but is instead composed of the multiple planes in space through which the figure moves.
Realistic principles extended to architecture as well. Antonio Sant&#x27;Elia formulated a Futurist manifesto on architecture in 1914. His visionary drawings of highly mechanized cities and boldly modern skyscrapers prefigure some of the most imaginative 20th-century architectural planning.

Boccioni, who had been the most talented artist in the group, and Sant&#x27;Elia both died during military service in 1916. Boccioni&#x27;s death, combined with expansion of the group&#x27;s personnel and the sobering realities of the devastation caused by World War I, effectively brought an end to the Futurist movement as an important historical force in the visual arts.

=== Metaphysical art ===

Metaphysical Painting is an Italian art movement, born in 1917 with the work of Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico in Ferrara. The word metaphysical, adopted by De Chirico himself, is core to the poetics of the movement.
They depicted a dreamlike imagery, with figures and objects seemingly frozen in time. Metaphysical Painting artists accept the representation of the visible world in a traditional perspective space, but the unusual arrangement of human beings as dummy-like models, objects in strange, illogical contexts, the unreal lights and colors, the unnatural static of still figures.

=== Novecento Italiano ===

Novecento movement, group of Italian artists, formed in 1922 in Milan, that advocated a return to the great Italian representational art of the past.
The founding members of the Novecento (Italian: 20th-century) movement were the critic Margherita Sarfatti and seven artists: Anselmo Bucci, Leonardo Dudreville, Achille Funi, Gian Emilio Malerba, Piero Marussig, Ubaldo Oppi, and Mario Sironi. Under Sarfatti&#x27;s leadership, the group sought to renew Italian art by rejecting European avant-garde movements and embracing Italy&#x27;s artistic traditions.

Other artists associated with the Novecento included the sculptors Marino Marini and Arturo Martini and the painters Ottone Rosai, Massimo Campigli, Carlo Carrà, and Felice Casorati.

=== Spatialism ===

Movement founded by the Italian artist Lucio Fontana as the Spatialism, its tenets were repeated in manifestos between 1947 and 1954.

Combining elements of concrete art, dada and tachism, the movement&#x27;s adherents rejected easel painting and embraced new technological developments, seeking to incorporate time and movement in their works. Fontana&#x27;s slashed and pierced paintings exemplify his theses.

=== Arte Povera ===

Arte Povera an artistic movement that originated in Italy in the 1960s, combining aspects of conceptual, minimalist, and performance art, and making use of worthless or common materials such as earth or newspaper, in the hope of subverting the commercialization of art. The phrase is Italian, and means literally, &quot;impoverished art.&quot;

=== Transavantgarde ===

The term Transavantgarde is the invention of the Italian critic Achille Bonito Oliva. He has defined Transavantgarde art as traditional in format (that is, mostly painting or sculpture); apolitical; and, above all else, eclectic.

==List of major museums and galleries in Italy==
== Advocacy and restrictions ==
According to the 2017 amendments to the Italian &quot;Codice dei beni culturali e del paesaggio&quot;, a work of art can be legally defined of public and cultural interest if it was completed at least 70 years before. The previous limit was 50 years. To make easier the exportations and the international commerce of art goods as a store of value, for the first time it was given to the private owners and their dealers the faculty to self-certify a commercial value less than 13.500 euros, in order to be authorized to transport goods out of the country&#x27;s borders and into the European Union, with no need of a public administrative permission.
The bill has passed and come into force on 29 August 2017. A public authorization shall be provided for archeological remains discovered underground or under the sea level.

<text>Street Faërie is the only studio album recorded by Cree Summer. It was released in 1999 on the Work Group, a now-defunct division of Sony Music Entertainment. The lyrics feature themes of racism, romantic liaisons, and spirituality into the lyrics of guitar-heavy pop and folk songs. &quot;Miss Moon&quot; is an ode to lovemaking while a woman is menstruating. &quot;Fall,&quot; a fully orchestral jazz ballad, reads like the breakup of a relationship but is in fact the literal interpretation of the wilting and decay of a leaf: &quot;Black stemmed, orange trimmed/with the slighest wind I&#x27;m fallen from you.&quot; &quot;Naheo&quot; is a tribute to Summer&#x27;s Native American roots, while &quot;Curious White Boy&quot; is a Black woman&#x27;s response to her white lover after she realizes he has become involved with her out of some sense of racial guilt: &quot;Another housekeeper fantasy?/Coffee-colored remedy for your hangover from history&quot;, and &quot;Mean Sleep&quot; is an uncredited duet with producer Lenny Kravitz.

<text>Borden Parker Bowne (January 14, 1847 – April 1, 1910) was an American Christian philosopher, Methodist minister and theologian. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature nine times.

==Life==
Bowne was born on January 14, 1847, near Leonardville in Monmouth County, New Jersey. In 1876 he became a professor of philosophy at Boston University, where he taught for more than thirty years. He later served as the first dean of the graduate school. Bowne was an acute critic of mechanistic determinism, positivism, and naturalism. He categorized his views as Kantianized Berkeleyanism, transcendental empiricism, and, finally, personalism, emphasizing freedom and the importance of the self, a philosophical branch of liberal theology: of this branch Bowne is the dominant figure; this personalism is sometimes called &quot;Boston personalism&quot;, in contrast with the California personalism of George Holmes Howison. Bowne&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, was published in 1882. Bowne was influenced by Hermann Lotze. He died on April 1, 1910, in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==

Bowne has influenced philosophy in various ways. For instance, there has been a direct line of personalists from Bowne through his student, Edgar Sheffield Brightman (1884–1954), through Brightman&#x27;s student, Peter Anthony Bertocci (1910–1989), to Bertocci&#x27;s student, Thomas O. Buford (born 1932).

There has also been a more general influence, as with Martin Luther King Jr., who studied at Boston University, and spoke in his &quot;Stride Toward Freedom&quot; of having gained &quot;a metaphysical basis for the dignity and worth of all human personality.&quot;

Bowne received nine nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature between 1906 and 1909—one from his own sister.

Boston University named a professorship in Bowne&#x27;s honor. The named professors are:
* Edgar S. Brightman (1925 - 1953)
* Peter Anthony Bertocci
* Stanley Rosen
* Charles L. Griswold
* Juliet Floyd (2023-)

<text>Dunmore Lang College is a residential college of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. 

The college is a non-profit organisation, affiliated with the university. Established in 1972, it was named after John Dunmore Lang, the first Presbyterian clergyman in Sydney. He arrived in Australia in 1823.

An influential figure in the early history of the college was Dorothy Isabel Knox, Principal of the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, Pymble, who guided community appeals for suitable accommodation for ladies. Since a site at the University of Sydney could not be found, attention turned to the then new Macquarie University.

Originally a ladies college, Dunmore Lang College soon became co-educational and in recent years a new wing was created expanding the college to accommodate about 260 students and new conference facilities. The college is fully catered and provides rooms with and without ensuites.

Dunmore Lang College is governed by a board of directors.

==Facilities==
There are three common rooms in the college, one for general students with cable television, pool table, table tennis and couches, one common room is dedicated to senior students and one for postgraduate students. It is also utilized by the whole college when the main common room is being used by the colleges conference clients. The college also has its own library. There is also a room dedicated to Chiropractic study with a Chiropractic bed.

==Student association==
The college&#x27;s student association is known as the ADS, which is affiliated with SAM (Students at Macquarie). They organise a variety of events throughout the year, including O-week and Dis-o-week activities and the annual pre-Conception Day party. Conception Day is an annual event at Macquarie University, a day music festival that commemorates the conception of Governor Macquarie.

The ADS also organises the annual sporting competition and debating competition against its neighbour and friendly rival Robert Menzies College.

==Staff==
Alasdair Murrie-West is the Principal of Dunmore Lang College. The college employs fourteen Resident Advisers to provide 24-hour student pastoral care. A variety of Resident Tutors are also employed to provide academic assistance.

<doc id="1079126" wikidata="Q4349418" url="?curid=1079126" title="Hock (anatomy)">
<text>The hock, tarsus or uncommonly gambrel, is the region formed by the tarsal bones connecting the tibia and metatarsus of a digitigrade or unguligrade quadrupedal mammal, such as a horse, cat, or dog. This joint may include articulations between tarsal bones and the fibula in some species (such as cats), while in others the fibula has been greatly reduced and is only found as a vestigial remnant fused to the distal portion of the tibia (as in horses). It is the anatomical homologue of the ankle of the human foot. While homologous joints occur in other tetrapods, the term is generally restricted to mammals, particularly long-legged domesticated species.

==Horse==
The terms &quot;tarsus&quot; and &quot;hock&quot; refer to the region between the gaskin (crus) and cannon regions (metatarsus), which includes the bones, joints, and soft tissues of the area. The hock is especially important in equine anatomy, due to the great strain it receives when the horse is worked. Jumping, quick turns or stops, and movements that require collection, are some of the more stressful activities.

===Primary joints and bones of the hock===
In the horse, the hock consists of multiple joints, namely:
*Tibiotarsal or tarsocrural joint
*Proximal intertarsal joint or talocalcanealcentroquartal joint
*Distal intertarsal joint or centrodistal joint
*Tarsometatarsal joint
*Talocalcaneal joint

In the horse, the hock consists of the following bones:
*Talus
*Calcaneus
*Central tarsal bone
*Fused 1st and 2nd tarsal bone
*3rd tarsal bone
*4th tarsal bone
*2nd metatarsal bone
*3rd metatarsal bone
*4th metatarsal bone

===Equine disease states===
*Horses may suffer from &quot;capped hock&quot;, which is caused by the creation of a false bursa, a synovial sac beneath the skin. Capped hock is usually caused by trauma such as kicking or slipping when attempting to stand. In the absence of a wound, it does not require immediate veterinary attention and is usually only of cosmetic significance. On the other hand, a wound into the calcanean bursa is a serious problem. A capped hock is extremely unlikely to be a cause of lameness, even if severe.
*Osteochondrosis dissecans, or OCD is a developmental defect in the cartilage or of cartilage and bone seen in particular locations on the surface of the tarsocrural joint. This condition is typically discovered when the horse is young, and is one cause of bog spavin. After surgery to remove bone and cartilage fragments most horses can return to full work.
*Distension of the tibiotarsal joint with excessive joint fluid and/or synovium is called bog spavin.
*Degenerative joint disease of the tarsometatarsal and/or distal intertarsal joint is referred to as bone spavin.
*Curb, or tarsal plantar desmitis, is traditionally considered a sprain of the plantar ligament, which runs down the back of the hock, serving functionally as a tension band connecting the calcaneus, the fourth tarsal bone and the fourth metatarsal bone. Recent work has shown that curb can be caused by damage to one of many soft tissue structures in this region.
*Stringhalt

===Conformational defects===
&quot;Also see equine conformation&quot;

Because the hock takes a great deal of strain in all performance disciplines, correct conformation is essential if the horse is to have a sound and productive working life. Common conformational defects include sickle hocks, post-legged conformation/straight hocks, cow hocks, and bowed hocks. Depending on the use of the horse, some defects may be more acceptable than others.

<text>Dirt Bike Annie was a rock band formed in New York City that played pop punk and power pop music. 

==Band history==
Dirt Bike Annie was formed in 1993 by Adam Rabuck while he was a student at New York University. The band&#x27;s two other consistent members throughout the years were bassist/vocalist Dan Paquin and guitarist/vocalist Jeanie Lee. Drummers in the band included Mike Yannich, Heth Weinstein (who during his tenure with the band was called &quot;Dirt Bike Deano&quot;), Tommy Vinton from Too Much Joy, and Dennis Donaghy.

At the top of 1996, Dirt Bike Annie released their first 7&quot; on their own label called Richie Records.

During the early phase of the career of rapper MC Chris, Dirt Bike Annie regularly performed as his backing band under their stage name, The Lee Majors.

In 2003, the band contributed two songs to the &quot;Project Gotham Racing 2&quot; soundtrack.

After a decade of touring and releasing records, the group disbanded in 2005 when Lee and Paquin left the band. One of their last shows together was on May 3 of that year, opening for MC Chris at the Continental in New York City. Lee left the band first, and Paquin decided to leave shortly thereafter. At that point, the remaining members decided it best to break up the band for good.

==After disbanding==
Founder, guitarist and lead singer Adam Rabuck has gone on to form The Impulse International and Rock University at Pennridge High School. Yannich (a.k.a. &quot;Mikey Erg&quot;) has been a prolific performer in the punk scene as a songwriter, solo performer, and drummer for The Ergs! and several other bands.

In 2010, Rabuck, Paquin and Mike Yannich played a 90-minute reunion set at the Insubordination Fest in Baltimore.

On June 10 2023, Rabuck, Lee, Paquin and Yannich reunited to perform at Bloated Kat Records&#x27; Bloated Fest at TV Eye in Queens, NY. It was their first performance with this lineup in nearly 20 years.

The four also contributed to the Whimsyland album, written by Chadd Derkins and released on Bloated Kat Records.

<doc id="1079129" wikidata="Q446124" url="?curid=1079129" title="Aquifer test">
<text>In hydrogeology, an aquifer test (or a pumping test) is conducted to evaluate an aquifer by &quot;stimulating&quot; the aquifer through constant pumping, and observing the aquifer&#x27;s &quot;response&quot; (drawdown) in observation wells. Aquifer testing is a common tool that hydrogeologists use to characterize a system of aquifers, aquitards and flow system boundaries.

A slug test is a variation on the typical aquifer test where an instantaneous change (increase or decrease) is made, and the effects are observed in the same well. This is often used in geotechnical engineering settings to get a quick estimate (minutes instead of days) of the aquifer properties immediately around the well.

Aquifer tests are typically interpreted by using an analytical model of aquifer flow (the most fundamental being the Theis solution) to match the data observed in the real world, then assuming that the parameters from the idealized model apply to the real-world aquifer. In more complex cases, a numerical model may be used to analyze the results of an aquifer test.

Aquifer testing differs from well testing in that the behaviour of the well is primarily of concern in the latter, while the characteristics of the aquifer are quantified in the former. Aquifer testing also often utilizes one or more monitoring wells, or piezometers (&quot;point&quot; observation wells). A monitoring well is simply a well which is not being pumped (but is used to monitor the hydraulic head in the aquifer). Typically monitoring and pumping wells are screened across the same aquifers.

==General characteristics==
Most commonly an aquifer test is conducted by pumping water from one well at a steady rate and for at least one day, while carefully measuring the water levels in the monitoring wells. When water is pumped from the pumping well the pressure in the aquifer that feeds that well declines. This decline in pressure will show up as drawdown (change in hydraulic head) in an observation well. Drawdown decreases with radial distance from the pumping well and drawdown increases with the length of time that the pumping continues.

The aquifer characteristics which are evaluated by most aquifer tests are:
* Hydraulic conductivity The rate of flow of water through a unit cross sectional area of an aquifer, at a unit hydraulic gradient. In US units the rate of flow is in gallons per day per square foot of cross sectional area; in SI units hydraulic conductivity is usually quoted in m3 per day per m2. Units are frequently shortened to metres per day or equivalent. 
* Specific storage or storativity: a measure of the amount of water a confined aquifer will give up for a certain change in head;
* Transmissivity The rate at which water is transmitted through whole thickness and unit width of an aquifer under a unit hydraulic gradient. It is equal to the hydraulic conductivity times the thickness of an aquifer; 
Additional aquifer characteristics which are sometimes evaluated, depending on the type of aquifer, include:
* Specific yield or drainable porosity: a measure of the amount of water an unconfined aquifer will give up when completely drained;
* Leakage coefficient: some aquifers are bounded by aquitards which slowly give up water to the aquifer, providing additional water to reduce drawdown;
* The presence of aquifer boundaries (recharge or no-flow) and their distance from the pumped well and piezometers.

==Analysis methods==
An appropriate model or solution to the groundwater flow equation must be chosen to fit to the observed data. There are many different choices of models, depending on what factors are deemed important including:

*leaky aquitards,
*unconfined flow (delayed yield),
*partial penetration of the pumping and monitoring wells,
*finite wellbore radius — which can lead to wellbore storage,
*dual porosity (typically in fractured rock),
*anisotropic aquifers,
*heterogeneous aquifers,
*finite aquifers (the effects of physical boundaries are seen in the test), and
*combinations of the above situations.

Nearly all aquifer test solution methods are based on the Theis solution; it is built upon the most simplifying assumptions. Other methods relax one or more of the assumptions the Theis solution is built on, and therefore they get a more flexible (and more complex) result.

===Transient Theis solution===

The Theis equation was created by Charles Vernon Theis (working for the US Geological Survey) in 1935, from heat transfer literature (with the mathematical help of C.I. Lubin), for two-dimensional radial flow to a point sink in an infinite, homogeneous aquifer. It is simply

:formula_1

where &quot;s&quot; is the drawdown (change in hydraulic head at a point since the beginning of the test in units of distance), &quot;u&quot; is a dimensionless parameter, &quot;Q&quot; is the discharge (pumping) rate of the well (volume per unit time), &quot;T&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are the transmissivity and storativity of the aquifer around the well (distance squared per unit time and dimensionless, respectively), &quot;r&quot; is the distance from the pumping well to the point where the drawdown was observed, &quot;t&quot; is the time since pumping began, and &quot;W(u)&quot; is the &quot;Well function&quot; (called the incomplete gamma function, formula_2, in non-hydrogeology literature). The well function is given by the infinite series

:formula_3

where &quot;γ&quot; is the Euler constant (=0.577216...). Typically this equation is used to find the average &quot;T&quot; and &quot;S&quot; values near a pumping well, from drawdown data collected during an aquifer test. This is a simple form of inverse modeling, since the result (&quot;s&quot;) is measured in the well, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; are observed, and values of &quot;T&quot; and &quot;S&quot; which best reproduce the measured data are put into the equation until a best fit between the observed data and the analytic solution is found.

The Theis solution is based on the following assumptions:
* The flow in the aquifer is adequately described by Darcy&#x27;s law (i.e. Re&lt;10). 
* homogeneous, isotropic, confined aquifer,
* well is fully penetrating (open to the entire thickness (&quot;b&quot;) of aquifer),
* the well has zero radius (it is approximated as a vertical line) — therefore no water can be stored in the well,
* the well has a constant pumping rate Q,
* the head loss over the well screen is negligible,
* aquifer is infinite in radial extent,
* horizontal (not sloping), flat, impermeable (non-leaky) top and bottom boundaries of aquifer,
* groundwater flow is horizontal
* no other wells or long term changes in regional water levels (all changes in potentiometric surface are the result of the pumping well alone)

Even though these assumptions are rarely all met, depending on the degree to which they are violated (e.g., if the boundaries of the aquifer are well beyond the part of the aquifer which will be tested by the pumping test) the
solution may still be useful.

===Steady-state Thiem solution===
Steady-state radial flow to a pumping well is commonly called the Thiem solution, it comes about from application of Darcy&#x27;s law to cylindrical shell control volumes (i.e., a cylinder with a larger radius which has a smaller radius cylinder cut out of it) about the pumping well; it is commonly written as:

: formula_4

In this expression &quot;h0&quot; is the background hydraulic head, &quot;h0&quot;-&quot;h&quot; is the drawdown at the radial distance &quot;r&quot; from the pumping well, &quot;Q&quot; is the discharge rate of the pumping well (at the origin), &quot;T&quot; is the transmissivity, and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of influence, or the distance at which the head is still &quot;h0&quot;. These conditions (steady-state flow to a pumping well with no nearby boundaries) &quot;never truly occur&quot; in nature, but it can often be used as an approximation to actual conditions; the solution is derived by assuming there is a circular constant head boundary (e.g., a lake or river in full contact with the aquifer) surrounding the pumping well at a distance &quot;R&quot;.
==Sources of error==
Of critical importance in both aquifer and well testing is the accurate recording of data. Not only must water levels and the time of the measurement be carefully recorded, but the pumping rates must be periodically checked and recorded. An unrecorded change in pumping rate of as little as 2% can be misleading when the data are analysed.

<text>John Morris Reeves, known as James Reeves (1 July 1909 – 1 May 1978) was a British writer principally known for his poetry, plays and contributions to children&#x27;s literature and the literature of collected traditional songs. His published books include poetry, stories and anthologies for both adults and children. He was also well known as a literary critic and a broadcaster.

==Biography==
John Morris Reeves was born in Wealdstone in the London Borough of Harrow, elder son of Albert John Reeves, a company secretary, and Ethel Mary, née Blench. He attended Nevill House school at Eastbourne, then Stowe School, where he won a scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge. From 1932 to 1952, he taught English in a number of schools and teachers&#x27; training colleges, subsequently becoming a freelance author and editor.

His first collection of poems, &quot;The Natural Need&quot;, was published in 1936 by the Seizin Press, run by Robert Graves and Laura Riding, whose work Reeves&#x27;s early poetry sometimes resembles. Numerous further volumes by Reeves include &quot;The Imprisoned Sea&quot; (1949), &quot;The Talking Skull&quot; (1958), and &quot;Poems and Paraphrases&quot; (1972). &quot;Collected Poems&quot; of 1974 is the fullest edition of his verses. His best work characteristically combines intensity of mood with an understated manner to distinctive and sometimes haunting lyrical effect. The rural descriptiveness of his less distinguished poetry is elsewhere the vehicle for an ironic pastoralism voicing his disaffection with urban modernity. His books of poetry for children were collected as &quot;The Wandering Moon and Other Poems&quot; (1973).

As an editor, Reeves was prolific, producing many anthologies of prose and poetry, as well as selections from the work of John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins, John Clare, and others, including &quot;Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson&quot; (1959). In this latter book, reprinted several times, he chose to add conventional punctuation to the poems, doing away with her characteristic dashes.he was a great poet.

One of his most outstanding poem is sky, sea , shore.
 &quot;Stars in a frosty sky
 Crackle and blaze;
 Streams in the lowland 
 meadows linger &amp; laze;
 Shells on the sea shore 
 gleam,washed by the tide;
 Seagulls over the Barbour
 Circle &amp; glide.
 Blue smoke and prancing 
 steed,swallow &amp; swan-
 How many more
 Curving, glistening 
 S- things in sky , sea
 Shore.&quot;

<text>A complex programmable logic device (CPLD) is a programmable logic device with complexity between that of PALs and FPGAs, and architectural features of both. The main building block of the CPLD is a macrocell, which contains logic implementing disjunctive normal form expressions and more specialized logic operations.

==Features==
Some of the CPLD features are in common with PALs:
* Non-volatile configuration memory. Unlike many FPGAs, an external configuration ROM is not required, and the CPLD can function immediately on system start-up.
* For many legacy CPLD devices, routing constrains most logic blocks to have input and output signals connected to external pins, reducing opportunities for internal state storage and deeply layered logic. This is usually not a factor for larger CPLDs and newer CPLD product families.

Other features are in common with FPGAs:
* Large number of gates available. CPLDs typically have the equivalent of thousands to tens of thousands of logic gates, allowing implementation of moderately complicated data processing devices. PALs typically have a few hundred gate equivalents at most, while FPGAs typically range from tens of thousands to several million.
* Some provisions for logic more flexible than sum-of-product expressions, including complicated feedback paths between macro cells, and specialized logic for implementing various commonly used functions, such as integer arithmetic.

The most noticeable difference between a large CPLD and a small FPGA is the presence of on-chip non-volatile memory in the CPLD, which allows CPLDs to be used for &quot;boot loader&quot; functions, before handing over control to other devices not having their own permanent program storage. A good example is where a CPLD is used to load configuration data for an FPGA from non-volatile memory.

==Distinctions==
CPLDs were an evolutionary step from even smaller devices that preceded them: PLAs (first shipped by Signetics) and PALs. These in turn were preceded by standard logic products, which offered no programmability and were used to build logic functions by physically wiring several standard logic chips (or hundreds of them) together (usually with wiring on a printed circuit board or boards, but sometimes, especially for prototyping, using wire wrap wiring).

The main distinction between FPGA and CPLD device architectures is that CPLDs are internally based on a collection of PLDs accompanied by a programmable interconnection structure, while FPGAs use logic blocks.

<doc id="1079134" wikidata="Q594062" url="?curid=1079134" title="Carnivore (software)">
<text>Carnivore, later renamed DCS1000, was a system implemented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that was designed to monitor email and electronic communications. It used a customizable packet sniffer that could monitor all of a target user&#x27;s Internet traffic. Carnivore was implemented in October 1997. By 2005 it had been replaced with improved commercial software.

==Development==
Carnivore grew out of an earlier FBI project called &quot;Omnivore&quot;, which itself replaced an older undisclosed (at the time) surveillance tool migrated at the US Navy by FBI Director of Integrity and Compliance, Patrick W. Kelley. In September 2000, the FBI&#x27;s Data Intercept Technology Unit (DITU) in Quantico, Virginia, launched a project to migrate Omnivore from Sun&#x27;s Solaris operating system to a Windows NT platform. This was done to facilitate the miniaturization of the system and support a wider range of personal computer (CPU) equipment. The migration project was called &quot;Triple Phoenix&quot; and the resulting system was named &quot;Carnivore.&quot;

== Configuration ==
The Carnivore system was a Microsoft Windows-based workstation with packet-sniffing software and a removable Jaz disk drive. This computer must be physically installed at an Internet service provider (ISP) or other location where it can &quot;sniff&quot; traffic on a LAN segment to look for email messages in transit. The technology itself was not highly advanced—it used a standard packet sniffer and straightforward filtering. No monitor or keyboard was present at the ISP. The critical components of the operation were the filtering criteria. Copies of every packet were made, and required filtering at a later time. To accurately match the appropriate subject, an elaborate content model was developed.
An independent technical review of Carnivore for the Justice Department was prepared in 2000.

==Controversy==
Several groups and scholars expressed concern regarding the implementation, usage, and possible abuses of Carnivore. In July 2000, the Electronic Frontier Foundation submitted a statement to the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary in the United States House of Representatives detailing the dangers of such a system. The Electronic Privacy Information Center also made several releases dealing with it. Criminologists also argued that Carnivore represents a diffusion of disciplinary power by a state agency.

The FBI countered these concerns with statements highlighting the target-able nature of Carnivore. Assistant FBI Director Donald Kerr was quoted as saying:
The Carnivore device works much like commercial &quot;sniffers&quot; and other network diagnostic tools used by ISPs every day, except that it provides the FBI with a unique ability to distinguish between communications which may be lawfully intercepted and those which may not. For example, if a court order provides for the lawful interception of one type of communication (e.g., e-mail), but excludes all other communications (e.g., online shopping) the Carnivore tool can be configured to intercept only those e-mails being transmitted either to or from the named subject.

... [it] is a very specialized network analyzer or &quot;sniffer&quot; which runs as an application program on a normal personal computer under the Microsoft Windows operating system. It works by &quot;sniffing&quot; the proper portions of network packets and copying and storing only those packets which match a finely defined filter set programmed in conformity with the court order. This filter set can be extremely complex, and this provides the FBI with an ability to collect transmissions which comply with pen register court orders, trap &amp; trace court orders, Title III interception orders, etc...

...It is important to distinguish now what is meant by &quot;sniffing.&quot; The problem of discriminating between users&#x27; messages on the Internet is a complex one. However, this is exactly what Carnivore does. It does NOT search through the contents of every message and collect those that contain certain key words like &quot;bomb&quot; or &quot;drugs.&quot; It selects messages based on criteria expressly set out in the court order, for example, messages transmitted to or from a particular account or to or from a particular user.
After prolonged negative coverage in the press, the FBI changed the name of its system from &quot;Carnivore&quot; to the more benign-sounding &quot;DCS1000.&quot; DCS is reported to stand for &quot;Digital Collection System&quot;; the system has the same functions as before.

==Successor==
The &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported in mid-January 2005 that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in 2001, in favor of commercially available software, such as NarusInsight, a mass surveillance system.
A report in 2007 described the successor system as being located &quot;inside an Internet provider&#x27;s network at the junction point of a router or network switch&quot; and capable of indiscriminately storing data flowing through the provider&#x27;s network.

<text>Oommen Chandy (31 October 1943 – 18 July 2023) was an Indian lawyer and statesman who served as the 10th chief minister of Kerala, serving from 2004 to 2006 and 2011 to 2016. He served also as the leader of the opposition in the Kerala Legislative Assembly from 2006 to 2011. 
He represented Puthuppally constituency as a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the State Assembly from 1970 until his death in 2023, making him the longest-serving member of the Kerala Legislature Assembly. He received an award for public service from the United Nations in 2013.

In 2018, he was appointed the general secretary of the All India Congress Committee, in charge of the state of Andhra Pradesh. He was also a Congress Working Committee member at the time of his death.

==Early life and education==
Oommen Chandy was born on 31 October 1943 in Kumarakom, Kottayam district, as the son of Baby and K. O. Chandy of the Karottu Vallakkalil house. 

He was named after his paternal grandfather, V. J. Oommen (Vallakkalil), a member of the Travancore Legislative Council. Oommen ventured into the political arena as an activist of Kerala&#x27;s largest student organization Kerala Students Union (KSU), the student wing of the Indian National Congress party. He was the unit president of the KSU at St. George High School, Puthupally, and went on to become the state president of the organization.
Oommen completed his pre-university course from CMS College, Kottayam and received a B.A. in economics from St. Berchmans College, Changanassery. Later, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law (LL.B) from the Government Law College, Ernakulam.

==Political life==

Oommen started his political career through the Kerala Students Union (KSU), in which he served as president from 1967 to 1969. He was elected as the president of the State Youth Congress in 1970.

===Electoral Performance ===

Oommen represented the Puthuppally constituency for five decades, having been elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1970, 1977, 1980, 1982, 1987, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021. During his legislative career, he also served as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee from 1996 to 1998.

==Positions Held==

===Minister===
Oommen Chandy was a minister in the Government of Kerala on four occasions. He was the minister for Labour from 11 April 1977 to 25 April 1977 in the first K. Karunakaran ministry and continued holding the same portfolio in the succeeding first A. K. Antony ministry until 27 October 1978. He was in the charge of Home Portfolio in the second K. Karunakaran ministry from 28 December 1981 to 17 March 1982. He was sworn in again as a minister in the fourth K. Karunakaran ministry on 2 July 1991. He was in charge of the Finance Portfolio and resigned from the cabinet on 22 June 1994 as a protest against Karunakaran&#x27;s denial of a Rajya Sabha ticket to a factional leader.

Oommen Chandy was a minister in the following ministries:

===Chief Minister of Kerala===

==== First term as chief minister (2004–2006) ====
The results of the parliamentary elections in May 2004 saw the Indian National Congress not winning a single seat in Kerala. The sitting chief minister, A.K. Antony, was forced to resign and accept responsibility for the poor results. On 30 August 2004, Oommen was elected as the Congress Legislature Party leader at the end of a meeting by AICC observers and clearance by the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi. The Congress-led alliance was defeated but managed to retain 42 out of 140 seats in the assembly and boost its vote-share by nearly 10% after the general election rout. He resigned as chief minister on 12 May 2006 following the defeat of his party in 2006 Assembly Elections.

==== Second term as chief minister (2011–2016) ====
UDF, led by Oommen Chandy, secured a slender margin of majority in the assembly election held on 13 April 2011 by winning 72 seats against the 68 seats of the LDF. He took the oath on 18 May 2011 with six other ministers of his cabinet. Later, thirteen other ministers were also inducted into his cabinet.
=== Leader of Opposition ===
Oommen was the leader of opposition in the twelfth Kerala Legislative Assembly. Under his leadership, UDF marked victories in Lok Sabha Election 2009, gaining 16 out of 20 parliament constituencies in Kerala. UDF also got an upper hand in local body elections.

=== Leader of Congress Parliamentary Party ===
After winning the closely contested 2011 assembly election, Congress&#x27;s legislative party unanimously elected Oommen as its leader.

==Awards and honours==
Oommen Chandy received the 2013 United Nations Public Service Award for the Asia-Pacific region, for &quot;Preventing and Combating Corruption in the Public Service.&quot; The award was presented on 27 June 2013, in Manama, Bahrain, by the UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Wu Hongbo. The award was based on the theme &quot;Transformative e-Government and Innovation: Creating a Better Future for All&quot;.

==Achievements==

Oommen Chandy first took charge as chief minister on 31 August 2004 and adopted the motto &quot;Athivegam Bahudooram&quot; (Fast and far). Sanctioning of unemployment allowance, and welfare measures for labourers were some of the measures introduced by his government. Oommen attended the 35th World Economic Forum held at Davos, Switzerland, in 2006. The &quot;Karunya&quot; benevolent scheme was implemented in 2011–2012, allowing free treatment of patients with cancer, haemophilia, and kidney and heart diseases. Forty-three Cochlear implant surgeries were performed under a Cochlear implant scheme for hearing impaired children. More organ implantation surgeries were done through &quot;Mruthasanjeevani&quot; project. Oommen also received the United Nation&#x27;s Public Service Award for his Mass Contact Programme (&quot;Jana Samparkka Paripadi&quot;), for hearing and solving the complaints of citizens. In 2005, Information Technology was made a compulsory subject for the school-level students, making Kerala the first Indian state to do so. Victers TV, which is India&#x27;s first public edutainment channel broadband network on EDUSAT for schools, was inaugurated by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam on 28 July 2005 at Thiruvananthapuram. The Hill highway project, a massive highway project that connects the eastern hilly areas of the districts of Kerala first proposed in 1960, was approved by the First Oommen ministry in 2005. The Government of Kerala approved the project and allocated funds on 17 January 2005, Oommen inaugurated the first phase of the project between Kasaragod and Palakkad at a function held in Payyavoor.

The Second Oommen ministry (2011–2016) adopted the motto &quot;Vikasanavum Karuthalum&quot; (Development and Care). Oommen Chandy&#x27;s regime was instrumental in beginning the construction of several massive infrastructure projects as well as some human-welfare schemes in Kerala which included the Kannur International Airport in Kannur, the Kochi Metro at Kochi, the Vizhinjam International Seaport at Thiruvananthapuram, and the Smart City project. The projects for Thiruvananthapuram Light Metro and Kozhikode Light Metro were approved in 2012. A suburban rail project was initiated in 2013.

The Technopark at Thiruvananthapuram became the largest Information Technology park in India with the inauguration of its third phase in 2014. The Taurus Downtown at Technopark was commenced during the period 2011–2016. The second phase of InfoPark, Kochi was inaugurated in May 2015. Phase two of InfoPark Thrissur was completed during the same period. The Park Centre of Cybercity at Kozhikode was formally opened by IT Minister P.K. Kunhalikutty on 15 February 2014. UL Cyberpark at Kozhikode was inaugurated in January 2016.

It was also during his administration that 12 new Taluks, 28 new Municipalities, and the Kannur Municipal Corporation were formed for more effective decentralisation and proper utilisation of resources in the state, It was the largest Taluk delimitation in the state of Kerala since 1957. A number of state highways were constructed under Oommen government, and the final decision to widen the national highways of the state to were taken in 2014. During his tenure, 227 road bridges costing nearly Rs 1,600 crore were built across Kerala, the most ever in the state. The Kozhikode bypass was completed and the works of Kollam Bypass and Alappuzha Bypass roads were restarted during 2011–2016. The Karamana-Kaliyikkavila and Kazhakootam-Karode bypasses for the city of Thiruvananthapuram were initiated and started. The Kochi-Mangalore GAIL pipeline was commissioned by the Second Oommen ministry in 2013. 

Oommen Chandy&#x27;s administration also made the decision to build at least one government medical college in each district without one, to ensure the presence of the public medical college in all 14 districts of Kerala, which was instrumental in the public health infrastructure of the state. As a part of the project, new medical colleges were established in the state starting in 2013, after a gap of 31 years. The National University of Advanced Legal Studies at Kochi was founded in 2005 and the Indian Institute of Technology at Palakkad was established in 2015. The universities founded during 2011–2016 period include the Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University at Tirur (2012) and APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University at Thiruvananthapuram (2014). The K. R. Narayanan National Institute of Visual Science and Arts at Kottayam was inaugurated in January 2016. In 2015, the Cochin International Airport became the world&#x27;s first fully solar-powered airport with the inauguration of a dedicated solar plant. The airport won the Champion of the Earth award in 2018, the highest environmental honour instituted by the United Nations. The airport was awarded The Best Airport in Asia-Pacific in 2020 (with 5–15 million passengers per annum) by the Airports Council International. The Kerala Urban Road Transport Corporation (KURTC) was formed under KSRTC in 2015 to manage affairs related to urban transportation. It was inaugurated on 12 April 2015 at Thevara. Works on the last phase of Kollam Bypass was started on 27 May 2015. 

Social welfare pensions were doubled during Oommen Chandy&#x27;s second ministry, increasing to Rs.600. The government distributed pensions ranging from Rs 800 – Rs 1,500. Social welfare pensions which had been distributed to 12.9 lakh people until 2011 were extended to 34.43 lakh during 2011–2016. Pensions for the disabled and widows were increased to Rs 800. Old-age pensions were increased to Rs 1,500 for those above 75 years and Rs 1,100 to those above 80 years. Other social welfare measures included free rations for those who lost their employment, and 4,14,552 houses for those who hadn&#x27;t homes before. Free rice was given to those who were below the poverty line. Food kits were distributed during Onam, Ramdan, and Christmas. A rubber Subsidy to ensure a minimum price of Rs 150/kg was implemented in 2015. The Kerala Public Service Commission filled vacant posts during 2011–2016, appointing as many as 1,67,096 job candidates, setting a record; 46,223 posts were created in the same period. The second Oommen ministry had also made the decision to prohibit liqueur in the state by discouraging bars. The number of political killings were relatively low (eleven) during 2011–2016. Kerala was declared as the first complete digital state of India on 27 February 2016.

Twenty-six sectors were identified for showcasing in the &quot;Emerging Kerala&quot; summit of 2012 held at Kochi.

==Controversies==

=== 2013 Kerala solar panel scam ===
The 2013 Kerala solar panel scam was one of the main scandals raised by the LDF-led opposition. It was also one of the main election issues used by LDF during 2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election.

However, the Crime Branch appointed by First Vijayan ministry in 2018 found that there was no evidence against Oommen in the scam. As part of the procedures, the state home secretary T. K. Jose had forwarded a report to the central government. According to the report, no evidence could be collected against Oommen Chandy and the Crime Branch failed to confirm that the incident mentioned in the complaint actually happened. The case was handed over to the central agency after several teams of the Kerala Police repeatedly failed to prove the allegations against Oommen.

=== Vizhinjam Port Corruption Accusation ===
The opposition led by CPI(M) had accused corruption in the Vizhinjam International Seaport project ahead of the 2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election.

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, in its report on Public Sector Undertakings for the financial year ending March 2016, presented to the Kerala state assembly, identified irregularities in the agreement executed by the then state government. The CAG report contended that by granting a ten-year concession period beyond the standard thirty-year term for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects, the state government&#x27;s agreement with the Adani Group for the Vizhinjam seaport project could potentially result in an additional revenue of Rs 29,217 crore for the concessionaire. This figure was calculated based on revenue projections outlined in the Feasibility Report prepared by Ernst and Young. Based on this CAG report,the first Vijayan ministry appointed a three-member judicial commission under Justice C. N. Ramachandran to investigate in May 2017.

In 2018, the commission concluded that there was no corruption with the state&#x27;s project and that there was no misuse of political power in the port project. The commission report stated that there was no evidence to prove there was corruption. C. N. Ramachandran said that &quot;Nobody came forward with any specific corruption charges against any individual and nobody ventured to give any evidence. When there is no allegation of corruption against anyone, there is no need to investigate corruption against anyone. That is why the commission has not found corruption against anyone.&quot;

=== Pattoor land case ===
The Pattoor Land Case was used by the LDF-led opposition ahead of 2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election. In February 2018, the Kerala High Court pointed out that the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) registered the first information report based on the wrong report prepared by Jacob Thomas. The court said that the claim that the property vests with Kerala Water Authority was not based on any document. As the High Court rejected the case, the UDF government got a clean chit. The High Court found that neither Oommen nor the UDF government was involved in any corruption.

=== Palmolein oil import scam ===
The Palmolein Oil Import Scam (1991–1992) refers to the alleged irregularities in the import of palmolein by the K. Karunakaran-led United Democratic Front government of the state of Kerala, India through the Power and Energy Limited Company. It was accused by the LDF-led opposition in 1992. However, a 2011 VACB probe found that Oommen, finance minister during 1991–1996, had no role in the corruption. The report filed by VACB said that Oommen Chandy was not aware of the details of the decision to import palmolein through a Singapore-based firm.

== Death and Funeral ==

=== Death ===
Oommen Chandy was diagnosed with advanced laryngeal (throat) cancer. He commenced immunotherapy treatment at HCG Cancer Centre in Bengaluru in December 2022. Additionally, he underwent laser biopsy in Germany, a procedure that reduces tumor size but does not eliminate cancer. Despite these treatments, Chandy succumbed to the disease and died on 18 July 2023 at the age of 79 due to complications from throat cancer. The demise occurred at the Chinmaya Mission Hospital in Bengaluru. 

===Funeral procession ===
 

Following his death, Chandy&#x27;s body was transported to Thiruvananthapuram via chartered flight for public homage, first at the durbar hall,Thiruvananthapuram and subsequently at the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) office. The Government of Kerala declared a public holiday on 18 July 2023 and a two-day state mourning in his honour. 
A solemn funeral procession began on 19 July 2023, traversing the 150 km distance from the state capital to Chandy&#x27;s hometown, Puthuppally in Kottayam district. A journey that typically takes five hours was extended to approximately 30 hours due to the immense public outpouring of grief. Thousands of people lined the route to bid their final farewells to the beloved leader. 
The final rites were conducted at St. George Orthodox Church, Puthuppally, on 20 July 2023, presided over by Mar Baselios Marthoma Mathews III. In honor of his dedicated public service, Oommen Chandy was laid to rest in a specially constructed tomb within the exclusive burial ground reserved for the Orthodox Church&#x27;s clergy. Respecting his wishes, the family declined state honors, with his son expressing his father&#x27;s desire for a simple funeral.

==Legacy==

After Oommen Chandy&#x27;s death, his son, Chandy Oommen, contested and won in the by-election.

KPCC President K Sudhakaran has said that Vizhinjam port should be named after Oommen Chandy since the port became a reality only due to his efforts.

<doc id="1079147" wikidata="Q434846" url="?curid=1079147" title="Roy Sullivan">
<text>Roy Cleveland Sullivan (February 7, 1912 – September 28, 1983) was an American park ranger in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. Between 1942 And 1977, Sullivan was claimed to have been struck by lightning on seven occasions, surviving all of them. For this reason, he gained the nicknames &quot;Human Lightning Conductor&quot; and &quot;Human Lightning Rod&quot;. Sullivan is recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the person struck by lightning more recorded times than any other human being.

== Personal life ==
Roy was born in Greene County, Virginia, on February 7, 1912. He started working as a ranger in Shenandoah National Park in 1936. Sullivan was described as a brawny man with a broad, rugged face, who resembled the actor Gene Hackman. He was said to have been avoided by people during the later years of his life, owing to fears of being struck by lightning, and that saddened him. He once recalled: &quot;For instance, I was walking with the Chief Ranger one day when lightning struck way off” (in the distance). The Chief said, &quot;I&#x27;ll see you later&quot;.

On the morning of September 28, 1983, Sullivan died at the age of 71 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Two of his ranger hats are on display at two Guinness World Exhibit Halls in New York City and South Carolina.

== Seven strikes ==

Sullivan described in detail each of the alleged strike encounters.

# Sullivan&#x27;s first documented lightning strike was in April 1942. He was said to have been hiding from a thunderstorm in a fire lookout tower. The tower was newly built and had no lightning rod at the time; it was said to have been struck seven to eight times. Sullivan described a scene from within the tower, saying that &quot;fire was jumping all over the place&quot;. Sullivan was said to then have run out from the burning tower, just before being struck a few feet away by lightning. It burned a half-inch strip all along his right leg, hit his toe, and left a hole in his shoe.
# He was hit again in July 1969. Unusually, he was hit while in his truck, driving on a mountain road – the metal body of a vehicle normally protects people from lightning strikes by acting as a Faraday cage. The lightning first hit nearby trees and was deflected into the open window of the truck. The strike knocked Sullivan unconscious, burned off his eyebrows and eyelashes, and set his hair on fire. The uncontrolled truck kept moving until it stopped near a cliff edge.
# In July 1970, Sullivan was struck while in his front yard. The lightning hit a nearby power transformer and from there jumped to his left shoulder, searing it.
# In the spring of 1972, Sullivan was working inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when he was struck again. It set his hair on fire; he tried to smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but could not fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he acquired a fear of death. For months, whenever he was caught in a storm while driving his truck, he would pull over and lie down on the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.
# On August 7, 1973, while he was out on patrol in the park, Sullivan saw a storm cloud forming and drove away quickly. But the cloud, he said later, seemed to be following him. When he finally thought he had outrun it, he decided it was safe to leave his truck. Soon after, he was struck by a lightning bolt. Sullivan stated that he actually saw the bolt that hit him. The lightning moved down his left arm and left leg and knocked off his shoe. It then crossed over to his right leg just below the knee. Still conscious, Sullivan crawled to his truck and poured the can of water, which he always kept there, over his head, which was on fire.
# The next strike, on June 5, 1976, injured his ankle. It was reported that he saw a cloud, thought that it was following him, tried to run away, but was struck anyway. His hair also caught fire.
# On June 25, 1977, Sullivan was struck while fishing in a freshwater pool. The lightning hit the top of his head, set his hair on fire, traveled down, and burnt his chest and stomach. Sullivan turned to his car when something unexpected occurred – a bear approached the pond and tried to steal trout from his fishing line. Sullivan had the strength and courage to strike the bear with a tree branch, despite the fact that his hair was on fire. He claimed that this was the twenty-second time he hit a bear with a stick in his lifetime.

All seven strikes were documented by the superintendent of Shenandoah National Park, R. Taylor Hoskins. Hoskins, however, was never present at any of the reported strikes and was not an active and present superintendent in Shenandoah National Park for many of the times Sullivan was supposedly struck. Sullivan himself recalled that the first time he was struck by lightning was not in 1942 but much earlier. When he was a child, he was helping his father to cut wheat in a field, when a thunderbolt struck the blade of his scythe without injuring him. But because he could not prove the fact later, he never claimed it.

Sullivan&#x27;s wife was also struck once, when a storm suddenly arrived as she was out hanging clothes in their back yard. Her husband was helping her at the time, but escaped unharmed.

== Statistics ==
The odds of being struck by lightning for over the period of 80 years have been roughly estimated as 1:10000. If the lightning strikes were independent events, the probability of being hit seven times would be (1:10000)7 = 1:1028 or 1 in 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 in 10 octillion). These numbers do not quite apply to Sullivan, however, who by the nature of his work and his physical location was exposed to more storms than the average person. Virginia, where he lived, averages 35 to 45 thunderstorm days per year, most of which fall in June, July, and August. Between 1959 and 2000, lightning killed 58 people and injured at least 238 people in Virginia. In the United States, 3,239 people were killed and 13,057 injured by lightning in the same period. Most of those were males between 20 and 40 years old caught outdoors.
== In popular culture ==
* The lyrics on the 2005 EP &quot;3 Songs&quot; by I Hate Myself are inspired by how Sullivan was lucky enough to survive being repeatedly struck by lightning.
* In the 2008 film &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;, the character Mr. Daws often tells the title character that he was &quot;struck by lightning seven times&quot; (a detail that does not appear in the original 1922 short story).
* In the 2016 video game &quot;Firewatch&quot;, an adventure game about a volunteer park ranger, Sullivan is mentioned when the main character says lightning doesn&#x27;t strike twice. The character Delilah then mentions Sullivan being struck seven times as well as his death by suicide.
* The 2021 short film &quot;Don vs Lightning&quot; is inspired by Sullivan&#x27;s story.

<doc id="1079148" wikidata="Q938841" url="?curid=1079148" title="John Burroughs">
<text>John Burroughs (April 3, 1837 – March 29, 1921) was an American naturalist and nature essayist, active in the conservation movement in the United States. The first of his essay collections was &quot;Wake-Robin&quot; in 1871.

In the words of his biographer Edward Renehan, Burroughs&#x27; special identity was less that of a scientific naturalist than that of &quot;a literary naturalist with a duty to record his own unique perceptions of the natural world.&quot; The result was a body of work whose resonance with the tone of its cultural moment explains both its popularity at that time, and its relative obscurity since.

==Early life and marriage==
Burroughs was the seventh of Chauncy and Amy Kelly Burroughs&#x27; ten children. He was born on the family farm in the Catskill Mountains, near Roxbury in Delaware County, New York. As a child he spent many hours on the slopes of Old Clump Mountain, looking off to the east and the higher peaks of the Catskills, especially Slide Mountain, which he would later write about. As he labored on the family farm he was captivated by the return of the birds each spring and other wildlife around the family farm including frogs and bumblebees. In his later years he credited his life as a farm boy for his subsequent love of nature and feeling of kinship with all rural things.

During his teen years Burroughs showed a keen interest in learning. Among Burroughs&#x27;s classmates was future financier Jay Gould. Burroughs&#x27; father believed the basic education provided by the local school was enough and refused to support the young Burroughs when he asked for money to pay for the books or the higher education he wanted. At the age of 17 Burroughs left home to earn funds needed for college by teaching at a school in Olive, New York.

From 1854 to 1856 Burroughs alternated periods of teaching with periods of study at higher education institutions including Cooperstown Seminary. He left the Seminary and completed his studies in 1856. He continued teaching until 1863. In 1857 Burroughs left a teaching position in the village of Buffalo Grove in Illinois to seek employment closer to home, drawn back by &quot;the girl I left behind me.&quot; On September 12, 1857, Burroughs married Ursula North (1836–1917). Burroughs later became an atheist with an inclination towards pantheism.

==Career==
Burroughs had his first break as a writer in the summer of 1860 when the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, then a fairly new publication, accepted his essay &quot;Expression&quot;. Editor James Russell Lowell found the essay so similar to Emerson&#x27;s work that he initially thought Burroughs had plagiarized his longtime acquaintance. &quot;Poole&#x27;s Index&quot; and &quot;Hill&#x27;s Rhetoric&quot;, both periodical indexes, even credited Emerson as the author of the essay.

In 1864, Burroughs accepted a position as a clerk at the Treasury; he would eventually become a federal bank examiner, continuing in that profession into the 1880s. All the while, he continued to publish essays, and grew interested in the poetry of Walt Whitman. Burroughs met Whitman in Washington, DC in November 1863, and the two became close friends.

Whitman encouraged Burroughs to develop his nature writing as well as his philosophical and literary essays. In 1867, Burroughs published &quot;Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person&quot;, the first biography and critical work on the poet, which was extensively (and anonymously) revised and edited by Whitman himself before publication. Four years later, the Boston house of Hurd &amp; Houghton published Burroughs&#x27;s first collection of nature essays, &quot;Wake-Robin&quot;.

In January 1873, Burroughs left Washington for New York. The next year he bought a farm in West Park, NY (now part of the Town of Esopus) where he built his Riverby estate. There he grew various crops before eventually focusing on table grapes. He continued to write, and continued as a federal bank examiner for several more years. In 1895 Burroughs bought additional land near Riverby where he and son Julian constructed an Adirondack-style cabin that he called &quot;Slabsides&quot;. He wrote, grew celery, and entertained visitors there, including students from local Vassar College. After the turn of the 20th century, Burroughs renovated an old farmhouse near his birthplace and called it &quot;Woodchuck Lodge.&quot; This became his summer residence until his death.

Burroughs accompanied many personalities of the time in his later years, including Theodore Roosevelt, John Muir, Henry Ford (who gave him an automobile, one of the first in the Hudson Valley), Harvey Firestone, and Thomas Edison. In 1899, he participated in E. H. Harriman&#x27;s expedition to Alaska.

According to Ford, &quot;John Burroughs, Edison, and I with Harvey S. Firestone made several vagabond trips together. We went in motor caravans and slept under canvas. Once, we gypsied through the Adirondacks and again through the Alleghenies, heading southward.&quot;

In 1901, Burroughs met an admirer, Clara Barrus (1864–1931). She was a physician with the state psychiatric hospital in Middletown, New York. Clara was 37 and nearly half his age. She was the great love of his life and ultimately his literary executrix. She moved into his house after Ursula died in 1917. She published &quot;Whitman and Burroughs: Comrades&quot; in 1931, relying on firsthand accounts and letters to documents Burroughs&#x27; friendship with poet Walt Whitman.

===Nature fakers controversy===
In 1903, after publishing an article entitled &quot;Real and Sham Natural History&quot; in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, Burroughs began a widely publicized literary debate known as the nature fakers controversy. Attacking popular writers of the day such as Ernest Thompson Seton, Charles G. D. Roberts and William J. Long for their fantastical representations of wildlife, he also denounced the booming genre of &quot;naturalistic&quot; animal stories as &quot;yellow journalism of the woods&quot;. The controversy lasted for four years and involved American environmental and political figures of the day, including President Theodore Roosevelt, who was friends with Burroughs.

==Writing==
Many of Burroughs&#x27; essays first appeared in popular magazines. He is best known for his observations on birds, flowers and rural scenes, but his essay topics also range to religion, philosophy, and literature. Burroughs was a staunch defender of Walt Whitman and Ralph Waldo Emerson, but somewhat critical of Henry David Thoreau, even while praising many of Thoreau&#x27;s qualities. His achievements as a writer were confirmed by his election as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Some of Burroughs&#x27; essays came out of trips back to his native Catskills. In the late 1880s, in the essay &quot;The Heart of the Southern Catskills,&quot; he chronicled an ascent of Slide Mountain, the highest peak of the Catskills range. Speaking of the view from the summit, he wrote: &quot;The works of man dwindle, and the original features of the huge globe come out. Every single object or point is dwarfed; the valley of the Hudson is only a wrinkle in the earth&#x27;s surface. You discover with a feeling of surprise that the great thing is the earth itself, which stretches away on every hand so far beyond your ken.&quot; The first sentence of this quote is now on a plaque commemorating Burroughs at the mountain&#x27;s summit, on a rock outcrop known as Burroughs Ledge. Slide and neighboring &quot;Cornell&quot; and &quot;Wittenberg&quot; mountains, which he also climbed, have been collectively named the Burroughs Range.

Other Catskill essays told of fly fishing for trout, of hikes over Peekamoose Mountain and Mill Brook Ridge, and of rafting down the East Branch of the Delaware River. It is for these that he is still celebrated in the region today, and chiefly known, although he traveled extensively and wrote about other regions and countries, as well as commenting on natural-science controversies of the day such as the theory of natural selection. He entertained philosophical and literary questions, and wrote another book about Whitman in 1896, four years after the poet&#x27;s death.

==Fishing==
From his youth, Burroughs was an avid fly fisherman and known among Catskill anglers. Although he never wrote any purely fishing books, he did contribute some notable fishing essays to angling literature. Most notable of these was &quot;Speckled Trout&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; in October 1870 and was later published in &quot;In The Catskills.&quot; In &quot;Speckled Trout&quot;, Burroughs highlights his experiences as an angler and celebrates the trout, streams and lakes of the Catskills.

==Death==
Burroughs enjoyed good physical and mental health during his later years until only a few months before his death when he began to experience lapses in memory and show general signs of advanced age including declining heart function. In February 1921 Burroughs underwent an operation to remove an abscess from his chest. Following this operation, his health steadily declined. Burroughs died on March 29, 1921, while on a train near Kingsville, Ohio. Burroughs was buried in Roxbury, New York, on what would have been his 84th birthday, at the foot of a rock he had played on as a child and affectionately referred to as &quot;Boyhood Rock&quot;. 

==Legacy==
A line that he had written years before is etched on the tablet that marks the spot at &quot;Boyhood Rock&quot; where Burroughs died: &quot;I stand amid the eternal ways&quot;. Woodchuck Lodge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. Riverby and Slabsides were similarly designated in 1968. All three are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Since his death in 1921, John Burroughs has been commemorated by the John Burroughs Association. The association maintains the John Burroughs Sanctuary in West Park, New York, a 170-acre plot of land surrounding Slabsides, and awards a medal each year to &quot;the author of a distinguished book of natural history&quot;.

Thirteen U.S. schools have been named after Burroughs, including public elementary schools in Washington, DC, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, public middle schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Los Angeles, a public high school in Burbank, California, and a private secondary school, John Burroughs School, in St. Louis, Missouri. Burroughs Mountain in Mount Rainier National Park is named in his honor. There was a medal named after John Burroughs and the John Burroughs Association publicly recognizes well-written and illustrated natural history publications. Each year the Burroughs medal is awarded to the author of a distinguished book of natural history, with the presentation made during the Association&#x27;s annual meeting on the first Monday of April.

An award bearing Burroughs name is available to Boy Scouts who attend Seven Ranges Scout Reservation in Kensington, Ohio. The requirements to achieve this award require ample knowledge in the field of plants, rocks and minerals, astronomy, and animals. The award has three levels: bronze, gold, and silver being the highest. Each level requires more knowledge in the given fields.

Burroughs Creek in St. Louis County, Missouri, was named to honor him.

== Famous quotes ==

&quot;The Kingdom of heaven is not a place, but a state of mind.&quot;

&quot;Leap, and the net will appear.&quot;

&quot;A man can fail many times, but he isn&#x27;t a failure until he begins to blame somebody else.&quot;

<doc id="1079150" wikidata="Q707178" url="?curid=1079150" title="Paul Magloire">
<text>Paul Eugène Magloire (; July 19, 1907 – July 12, 2001), nicknamed Kanson Fè (Iron Pants), was the Haitian president from 1950 to 1956.

==Early life==
Paul Eugène Magloire ne Paul Vincent Magloire, 30th president of Haiti and 33rd head of state (ephemeral military governments were excluded from the count), was born on July 19, 1907, in Quartier-Morin, commune of Cap-Haitien, in the North Departement. Paul was the son of a high-ranking General Eugene Francois Magloire, and Marie-Philomene Mathieu. He attended Lycee Philippe Guerrier. On April 18, 1936, he wed Yolette Leconte, a direct descendant of Jean-Jacques Dessalines; the marriage lasted till her death in 1981.

==Military career==
On September 1, 1930, Paul joined the army. In 1935, he found himself in Cap-Haitien as sub-commander of this military district, a position he maintained until 1938 when he was promoted to the rank of captain and to the post of commander of the same district. In 1941, he was transferred to Port-au-Prince as commander of the National Penitentiary (also called Grand Prison) The following year he graduated from the Port-au-Prince Law School. He became Police Chief of Port-au-Prince in 1944. In January 1946, the population rose up against President Elie Lescot who found himself in great difficulty in Port-au-Prince. Lescot would later be accused by parliamentary committees of having used public funds to participate in World War II alongside the United States of America without taking into account the daily realities of the Haitian masses or the interests of Haiti. Magloire therefore proposes to President Élie Lescot to hand over power to a military junta of 3 members including Magloire himself who will occupy the post of Minister of the Interior and National Defense, from January 12 to August 16, 1946, Colonel Franck Lavaud and Antoine Levelt.

In August 1946, Dumarsais Estimé was elected President of Haiti against Dantès Louis Bellegarde. Magloire then found himself in the opposition and created MOP (Mouvement Ouvrier Paysan). In 1947, during a parliamentary session in Port-au-Prince, two ministers of the government of Dumarsais Estimé informed the parliamentary commission of inquiry that Haiti&#x27;s participation in the Second World War cost 20 million US dollars to the government. Haitian State and generates only 1.5 million US dollars following the liquidation of German property sequestered in the country. Magloire ousted him with the help of a local elite and took power. In 1950, he was proclaimed Colonel in the Haitian Army.

==Presidency==
In May 1950, Colonel Franck Lavaud returned to power provisionally with the mission of organizing presidential elections to hand power over to a civilian, and Magloire joined him. In December of the same year, Magloire ran for the presidency. The election was the first in the nation&#x27;s history where all adult males had the right to vote. Magloire won against a fragile coalition of socialists, communists, and conservatives.

During Magloire&#x27;s rule, Haiti became a tourist spot for American and European tourists. His anti-communist position also gained favorable reception from the US government. In addition, he emphasized public works; revenues from the sale of coffee were used to repair towns, construct roads, public buildings, and a dam. He also oversaw the institution of women&#x27;s suffrage. 

Magloire was very fond of a vivid social life, staging numerous parties, social events, and ceremonies. Shortly after he came to power in December 1950, he amended the constitution to set up, by referendum, a republican presidential regime and broke with parliamentarism. His consistently anti-Communist policy was appreciated and supported by the United States. During his reign the streets of Cap-Haitien were asphalted, and the monuments of Vertières as well as the gatehouses of Barrière-Bouteille were built at the southern entrance to the capital. The result of such measures was that Haiti became one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Caribbean. 

From 1954, Magloire&#x27;s popularity fell. In that year Hurricane Hazel ravaged the country, and funds intended to provide relief for the populace were often stolen before they could reach those in need. 

Magloire could not be a candidate for re-election, because the new Haitian political system did not permit more than a single term for a president. Accordingly, on December 12, 1956, Magloire&#x27;s reign came to an end.

==Exile and death==
Having resigned, Magloire fled the country amid strikes and demonstrations. Political instability continued in Haiti for most of the next eight months, with no one individual (military or civilian) able to dominate. The instability finished only when François Duvalier, whom most outsiders mistook for an unworldly intellectual, achieved power. On October 15, 1957, about a month after Duvalier became president, Magloire was officially condemned to exile and stripped of his Haitian citizenship. Thereafter the new regime confiscated all the properties owned by Magloire and his brothers, Arsène and Fernand; Magloire himself settled in New York City.

In 1986, when Duvalier&#x27;s son and successor Jean-Claude lost office, Magloire left New York and returned to Haiti. Two years later he became an unofficial army advisor, although his hopes of regaining the presidency were never fulfilled. On July 19, 1997, he obtained the rare distinction of being made &quot;Marshal of Haiti&quot;. He died, aged 93, on July 12, 2001. The Haitian government accorded him a state funeral.

<text>Daniel Keith Ludwig (June 24, 1897 – August 27, 1992) was an American shipping businessman, who was also involved in many other industries. He pioneered the construction of super tankers in Japan, founded Exportadora de Sal, SA in Mexico and developed it as the largest salt company in the world, built a model community in association with the Jari project, which he pioneered, on the Amazon River in Brazil to produce pulp paper, and had numerous hotels around the world.

Though he was one of the wealthiest tycoons of his day, with operations spanning 23 countries, Ludwig remained completely obscure due to his reclusive lifestyle. He &quot;avoided the press like the plague&quot;, keeping a low profile throughout his business career. He only gave one interview during his lifetime, which he granted to Dero A. Saunders of Fortune Magazine in 1957. Ludwig was #1 on the Forbes 400 in 1982.

Daniel Keith Ludwig was born in 1897 to Daniel Franklin Ludwig (1873–1960) and Florabelle Leslie (1876–1961) in South Haven, Michigan, on the shores of Lake Michigan. His grandfather, John G. Ludwig (1842–1920), was one of seven brothers in a family of 13, most of them born in Pennsylvania. Four of Daniel&#x27;s granduncles made their living as captains of Great Lakes vessels. His grandfather&#x27;s brother, Lancaster Columbus Ludwig (1855–1954), served as a captain on a passage steamer from South Haven to Chicago for many decades.

The senior Daniel and his wife Florabelle separated when young Daniel was 15. Daniel Sr. took the youth to Port Arthur, Texas to live with his grandfather John G. Ludwig. Florabelle Ludwig was left alone in South Haven without any means of support. She remarried Daniel Robert Martin in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1915 and resided in the state of Washington the rest of her life. Daniel Sr. moved to Virginia and remarried Isabel Rutherford. Daniel Sr. died in Manatee, Florida in 1960.

Ludwig&#x27;s first venture into shipping was at the age of nine, when he salvaged a boat. He left school at the end of eighth grade to work in various shipping-related jobs on Lake Michigan and in Texas, directly learning such trades as machinist, marine engineer, and ship handler. In Port Arthur, he sold supplies to sailing ships and steamers. He returned to Michigan to take a job at a marine engine plant, which sent him to the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.

==Early business ventures==

At 19, Ludwig established a freighter business by transporting molasses and lumber around the Great Lakes. There are rumors of his engaging in rum running during the Prohibition era.

In the 1930s, he developed a novel approach to financing further expansion, by borrowing the construction cost of tankers and using pre-agreed charters as collateral. His National Bulk Carriers became one of the largest American shipping companies, and he eventually owned about 60 vessels. In the 1940s, one of his shipyards in Virginia developed a method to use welding instead of riveting, which saved time during World War II, when there was huge demand for new ships. After the war, he had ships built in Japan, where labor costs were lower. His ships transported oil around the world; in the 1950s he pioneered the construction and use of the new oil supertankers. 
Ludwig diversified into a wide range of holdings: an oil refinery, banking, cattle ranching, insurance, and real estate. He invested in various mining and exploration projects on nearly every continent: the Americas, Africa, Australia and the Middle East. He created a chain of luxury hotels in Mexico, Bermuda and the Bahamas, and developed Westlake Village, California. At his peak, he owned more than 200 companies in 50 countries, and his fortune was estimated at $4.5 billion.

==Princess International Hotels==
Ludwig built or bought an impressive collection of hotels. These were: the Hamilton Princess and Southampton Princess in Bermuda; the Bahamas Princess (formerly the King&#x27;s Inn) and the Xanadu Princess Tower (formerly the International) in Freeport; the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marques in Mexico; and the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco. The American millionaire recluse Howard Hughes acquired the Xanadu Princess in 1973, and lived there for the last two years of his life.

==Exportadora de Sal, SA==
In 1954, on a trip to Baja California Sur, Ludwig founded Exportadora de Sal S.A., which became the &quot;Largest Salt Company in the World&quot;, at the Guerrero Negro lagoon. As the rural area was largely uninhabited, Ludwig arranged for the necessary workers and materials to be transported there to build a large, new town in the municipality of Mulegé. Here, the saltworks were established by pumping the brine to the surface and allowing it to dry. In 1973, with rumors that the Mexican Government would nationalize the company, Ludwig sold his interest in Exportadora de Sal, SA to Mitsubishi. It owns 49%, with the Mexican government holding the controlling interest.

==Citricos de Chiriqui, SA==
In a $25 million 1960 project in Panama, Ludwig bought of land in Dolega, in the interior of Panama to develop for citrus cultivation. He had all the land cleared and built roads and bridges. He had 800,000 Valencia orange trees planted, with full production expected by 1967. It was considered the largest privately owned venture of its kind in the world. Years later it was nationalized. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that an auction of Citricos de Chiriqui, SA failed to attract any bidders; the minimum asking price was $13.9 million. It was later purchased by Colombian businessman, Guillermo Cardenas P., and is still functioning to date.

==Jari project==

In 1966 Ludwig became attracted to ideas of development in the Amazonian Basin. A brutal military dictatorship had toppled the progressive Goulart government in a 1964 coup, with US backing, and US investment was encouraged by the conservative Brazilian generals in power. In 1967, he purchased about 4 million acres (1.6 million ha) of land in Brazil on the north bank of the river in the northeast interior for $3 million. He planned to construct a pulp paper factory, known as the Jari project, as he projected a shortage of fiber on the world market in the coming decades (about which he was right). The site was downriver from American Henry Ford&#x27;s failed massive project to produce rubber, for which he built a workers&#x27; city in the jungle, Fordlandia.

Ludwig planned a massive pulp paper project, and cleared land to plant two varieties of trees to be harvested for paper. He had a 26-mile railroad constructed, as well as 3,000 miles of trails and roads; the settlements had 30,000 inhabitants by early 1982. To feed all the workers, he raised cattle and planted 15,000 acres in rice. In order to develop this, he essentially built a planned community, Monte Dourado. A slum, Beiradao, arose haphazardly across the river from Ludwig&#x27;s development.

Ultimately his agricultural ventures on that land were not successful. Neither the rice nor one variety of trees took well to the region&#x27;s soil. But in 1978 he had a plant shipped by sea in two parts from where it was fabricated in Japan: these were &quot;two behemoths 70 meters high, unique in the history of the merchant navy.&quot; The plant was assembled and beginning in February 1979, Jari produced 750 tons of cellulose per day. Losses of $1 billion and mounting criticism of his business practices led Ludwig to sell out to Brazilian investors in 1981. He had pushed for more cooperation from the government, and announced failing health as a reason to sell his interests.

&quot;Le Monde&quot; described Ludwig with his Jari project as ahead of his time. It reported that in the 21st century a Brazilian consortium bought the Jari complex. Eucalyptus and Australian pine trees were planted that are better suited to the region. New Finnish machinery and technology has drastically reduced the required labor force and, as &quot;Le Monde&quot; noted, machines neither strike nor go to the brothels of Beiradao. The government cooperated in approving a hydropower project which Ludwig had sought, and even the slum was improved, as well as renamed to Laranjal do Jari. Ludwig had the right vision about the need for paper, but was ahead of his time and too late in his life to see the project through to its current success.

==Philanthropy==
Beginning in 1971, Ludwig sold off many of his foreign interests, using the funds to endow the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, which he founded in Switzerland. It became his primary interest in his later years. Since his death in 1992, it has distributed over a billion dollars around the world for cancer research.

Under the terms of his will, Ludwig Centers were established in 2006 at six United States research institutions (Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Stanford University and the University of Chicago). To date, they have received US$900 million from the Virginia and Daniel K. Ludwig Fund for Cancer Research.

The Centers and the Ludwig Institute are now collectively known as Ludwig Cancer Research. By the terms of the grant, their directors and scientists are to work collaboratively with each other and with the Institute.
In Canada Rodrigue Choquette, alias Roddy Choquette, was one of his finance advisor.

==Personal life==
Ludwig married Gladys Madeline Ludwig (1904–1978), in Florida on October 29, 1928. She gave birth to her daughter Patricia Margaret born on October 8, 1936. Estranged from his wife, Ludwig did not acknowledge the girl as his daughter. The couple divorced in April 1937.

Believing Patricia might at some later time try to challenge the terms of his will and claim part of his estate, Daniel Ludwig had blood samples frozen in the 1970s that could be used for genetic testing if ever necessary. Patricia Ludwig did file a lawsuit in the 1990s after his death, but DNA analysis proved Ludwig was not her father, and the case was dismissed. Katherine Jones, Patricia&#x27;s aunt, claimed that everyone in the family thought that Patricia&#x27;s father was James Sullivan, a sales rep who died in a car accident in 1939 

Several months after his divorce, Ludwig married Gertrude Virginia &quot;Ginger&quot; Higgins (January 13, 1897 – April 8, 1993), a widow with three children from a previous marriage. They lived in the penthouse at the Park Cinq, a co-op in Manhattan, and remained married until his death there on August 27, 1992.

<text>ERE Informatique was one of the first French video game companies, founded in 1983 by , joined a year later by Philippe Ulrich. The company hired freelance game programmers that received royalties for their creations.

==History==
Initially, the company published titles for the Amstrad CPC, Spectrum and Oric home computers. In 1984 they published their first national hit, a flight simulator created by Marc André Rampon: &quot;Intercepteur Cobalt&quot; for Sinclair ZX81 and Spectrum, also known under the name of &quot;&quot; for Oric, Amstrad and Thomson MO5. Rampon also acquired some shares of the company owned by Viau and established the company&#x27;s first distribution network.

Their first international hit, topping many international sales list for several months, was &quot;Macadam Bumper&quot; (1985), a pinball simulation programmed by Rémi Herbulot, a self-taught ex-employee of Valeo living in Caen. This and several later titles were distributed (and labelled) by PSS in the United Kingdom, thanks to a mutual distribution agreement.
ERE underwent serious financial problems due to some distributors delaying payments (and some ultimately entering bankruptcy), and was looking to partner with a company able to ensure a secure distribution. FIL and Infogrames went into competitive bidding and eventually Infogrames entered Ere&#x27;s share capital by buying out Rampon&#x27;s shares by the end of 1986. Infogrames later acquired complete control of ERE in June, 1987.

Its Exxos label, announced in 1988 would produce their most famous and creative games. Due to financial problems, chiefly royalty inpayment, ERE&#x27;s members left Infogrames in 1989 to form an independent developer group named Cryo, that would be made into an official company in 1992 as Cryo Interactive Entertainment.

==Exxos==
The development label Exxos was announced to the press in a ceremony at Champs Elysées ERE Studio 102 on June 12, 1988. Philippe Ulrich delivered the following litany to the press (translated from French):

The new label would release games with two requisites: original stories and worlds drawn from science fiction — a running interest among many members of ERE — or fantasy and translated to various languages, to achieve wide international distribution.

<text>Thérèse Humbert (1856–after 1936) was a French female fraudster, who pretended to be an heir of an imaginary American millionaire named Robert Crawford.

==Biography==
Humbert was born Thérèse Daurignac, a peasant girl in Aussonne, Midi-Pyrénées, France. As a child, she once convinced her friends to pool their jewelry so that she could fool others into believing she was wealthy. She married Frédéric Humbert, son of the mayor of Toulouse. Soon after, she began to tell a tale that she had received an unusual inheritance.

Humbert claimed that in 1879, when she was in a train, she heard groans from the next compartment. She entered into it by climbing along the outside of the train. There she found a man who was having a heart attack. When she had helped him with her smelling salts, the man told her he was an American millionaire named Robert Henry Crawford, and that he was eternally grateful and would reward her some day. Two years later in 1881, she received a letter stating that Crawford had died and made her beneficiary of his will. The will stated that the Humberts were to look after the family fortune in a safe that should remain sealed until her younger sister Marie was old enough to marry Henry Crawford, one of Crawford&#x27;s two nephews.

With this story, Humbert obtained a huge loan using the supposed inheritance as a collateral. She moved to Paris with her husband and bought an elaborate house in .

Humbert gathered much influence, fame and wealth. Her salon became a center of socializing. Humbert and her associates, other members of the Humbert family, borrowed money against the nonexistent inheritance. They lived in luxury for about 20 years, spending their money on flowers, elaborate dresses and banquets. Eventually they had to borrow more money to cover the previous loans. There were suspicions, but nobody was able to prove the story false.

In 1883, newspaper published a skeptical article, but Humbert&#x27;s father-in-law, who at the time was the minister of justice, supported her story. Humbert claimed that the Crawfords had sued him so that she would have to place her part of the inheritance to bank. After lengthy litigation, during which the two Crawford nephews, Henry and Robert, appeared in court, the court ruled that the locked safe should remain in Humbert&#x27;s possession.

When Jules Bizat, official for the French bank, asked Humbert how she had invested her money, she claimed that it was in government bonds. Bizat checked and found that it was not the case. Humbert had organized a generous pension plan she had named to get more money and used it to pay her debts and buy bonds.

Eventually the creditors noticed that the supposed amount of the inheritance would never be able to cover all the loans and legal costs. &quot;Le Matin&quot; demanded that the safe should be opened. In 1901, Humbert&#x27;s creditors sued her, and the next year the Parisian court gave an order that the fabled safe would be opened to prove the existence of the money. The safe was found nearly empty, containing only a brick and an English halfpenny.

The scandal rocked the French financial world, and thousands of smaller creditors and investors were ruined. The in-laws of the painter Henri Matisse, M. and Mme. Parayre, became scapegoats in the affair. Matisse&#x27;s mother-in-law, who was the Humbert family&#x27;s housekeeper, fell under suspicion, and her husband was arrested. Matisse&#x27;s studio was searched by detectives, and his wife&#x27;s family found themselves menaced by angry mobs of fraud victims. M. Parayre eventually went on hunger strike in an attempt to clear his name, with Matisse acting in lieu of a lawyer.

The Humberts had already fled the country, but they were arrested in Madrid in December 1902. Thérèse Humbert was tried and sentenced to five years&#x27; hard labor. Her two brothers, who had masqueraded as Crawford&#x27;s nephews, were sentenced to two and three years each. Her husband Frédèric was also sentenced to five years. Her sister Marie, daughter Eve and deceased father-in-law, the justice minister Gustave Humbert, were stated to be victims of the fraud.

The generally held theory is that when Thérèse Humbert was released from prison, she emigrated to the United States and that she died in Chicago in 1918. People whom she had defrauded remained mostly silent to avoid further embarrassment.

Most sources repeat that Thérèse emigrated to Chicago where she died. However, in the weekly paper , edition number 79 dated 1 May 1930, there is an article entitled (20 Years of Conjuring&#x27;). The article is written by Monsieur J. France who was one of the leading lights in the prosecution against Thérèse Humbert and who went to Madrid to take her back to Paris for trial. The story of the fraud is retold in the article following the death of Romain Daurignac, the brother of Thérèse. In this article, J. France says: &#x27;Thérèse Humbert is still living, poorly, in Paris. She has lost her miraculous vitality. What a reverse of fortune her golden past has left her. She is a quite humble old lady, who never speaks to anyone.&quot; () There are also two photos. One of these shows the door to a house in Paris and has underneath the note: &#x27;Here, boulevard des Batignolles, lives to-day, she who was &quot;. () On the second photo the note beneath says: &#x27;Behind these windows with the white curtains, Thérèse Humbert meditates on her past&#x27;. () Her husband died in 1936; he is not listed as a widower.

== Adaptations ==

A French crime drama based on her life was released in 1983, &quot;Thérèse Humbert&quot;, directed by Marcel Bluwal and written by Jean-Claude Grumberg, with Oscar and Emmy winning actress Simone Signoret as Thérèse Humbert.

<text>Raja Rao (8 November 1908 – 8 July 2006) was an Indian-American writer of English-language novels and short stories, whose works are deeply rooted in metaphysics. &quot;The Serpent and the Rope&quot; (1960), a semi-autobiographical novel recounting a search for spiritual truth in Europe and India, established him as one of the finest Indian prose stylists and won him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1963. For the entire body of his work, Rao was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 1988. Rao&#x27;s wide-ranging body of work, spanning a number of genres, is seen as a varied and significant contribution to Indian English literature, as well as World literature as a whole.

==Early life==
Raja Rao was born on 8 November 1908 in Hassan, in the princely state of Mysore (now in Karnataka in South India) into a Kannada-speaking Brahmin family and was the eldest of 9 siblings, with seven sisters and a brother named Yogeshwara Ananda. His father, H.V. Krishnaswamy, taught Kannada, the native language of Karnataka, and Mathematics at Nizam College in Hyderabad. His mother, Gauramma, was a homemaker who died when Raja Rao was 4 years old.

The death of his mother when he was four left a lasting impression on the novelist – the absence of a mother and orphanhood are recurring themes in his work. Another influence from early life was his grandfather, with whom he lived in Hassan and Harihalli or Harohalli).

Rao was educated at a Muslim school, the Madarsa-e-Aliya in Hyderabad. After matriculation in 1927, he studied for his degree at Nizam&#x27;s College. Osmania University, where he became friend with Ahmed Ali. He began learning French. After graduating from the University of Madras, having majored in English and history, he won the Asiatic Scholarship of the Government of Hydrabad in 1929, for studying abroad.

Rao moved to the University of Montpellier in France. He studied French language and literature, and later at the Sorbonne in Paris, he explored the Indian influence on Irish literature. He married Camille Mouly, who taught French at Montpellier, in 1931. The marriage lasted until 1939. Later he depicted the breakdown of their marriage in &quot;The Serpent and the Rope&quot;. Rao published his first stories in French and English. In 1931 to 1932, he contributed four articles written in Kannada for &quot;Jaya Karnataka&quot;, an influential journal.

==Nationalist novelist==
Returning to India in 1939, he edited &quot;Changing India&quot; with Iqbal Singh, an anthology of modern Indian thought from Ram Mohan Roy to Jawaharlal Nehru. He participated in the Quit India Movement of 1942. In 1943–1944 he co-edited a journal from Bombay called &quot;Tomorrow&quot; with Ahmad Ali. He was a prime mover in the formation of cultural organisation &quot;Sri Vidya Samiti&quot;, devoted to reviving the values of ancient Indian civilisation. 

Rao&#x27;s involvement in the nationalist movement is reflected in his first two books. The novel &quot;Kanthapura&quot; (1938) was an account of the impact of Gandhi&#x27;s teaching on nonviolent resistance against the British. Rao borrows the style and structure from Indian vernacular tales and folk-epics. He returned to the theme of Gandhism in the short story collection &quot;The Cow of the Barricades&quot; (1947). &quot;The Serpent and the Rope&quot; (1960) was written after a long silence, and dramatised the relationships between Indian and Western culture. The serpent in the title refers to illusion and the rope to reality. &quot;Cat and Shakespeare&quot; (1965) was a metaphysical comedy that answered philosophical questions posed in the earlier novels.
He had great respect for women, and once said, &quot;Women is the Earth, air, ether, sound, women is the microcosm of the mind&quot;.

==Later years==
Rao relocated to the United States and was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin from 1966 to 1986, when he retired as Emeritus Professor. Courses he taught included: Marxism to Gandhism; Mahayana Buddhism; Indian philosophy: The Upanishads; Indian philosophy: The Metaphysical Basis of the Male and Female Principle; and Razor&#x27;s Edge.

In 1965, he married Katherine Jones, an American stage actress. They had one son, Christopher Rama. In 1986, after his divorce from Katherine, Rao married his third wife, Susan Vaught, whom he met when she was a student at the University of Texas in the 1970s. In 1988 he received the prestigious International Neustadt Prize for Literature. In 1998 he published Gandhi&#x27;s biography &quot;Great Indian Way: A Life of Mahatma Gandhi.&quot;

Rao died of heart failure on 8 July 2006, at his home in Austin, Texas, at the age of 97.

==Raja Rao Award for Literature==
The &#x27;Raja Rao Award for Literature&#x27; was created in Rao&#x27;s honor, and with his permission, in the year 2000. It was established &quot;to recognize writers and scholars who have made an out standing contribution to the Literature and Culture of the South Asian Diaspora.&quot; The award was administered by the Samvad India Foundation, a nonprofit charitable trust named for the Sanskrit word for dialogue, which was established by Makarand Paranjape of Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi to bestow the award and to promote education and cultural contributions to India and the South Asian diaspora. No cash prize was attached to the award during its existence. The Award was bestowed seven times between 2000 and 2009.

The inaugural recipient of the Award was K. S. Maniam of Malaysia, who was bestowed the award in 2000. Other recipients were Yasmine Gooneratne of Sri Lanka, Edwin Thumboo of Singapore, Harsha V. Dehejia of Canada, David Dabydeen of Guyana, Varadaraja V. Raman of the United States, and Vijay Mishra of Fiji. Meenakshi Mukherjee, chair of the last awarding jury, died in 2009, and the award was discontinued that same year, and has not since been bestowed.

Those who served as jurors for selection of the recipient included Meenakshi Mukherjee (Chair), Braj Kachru, Victor Ramraj, and Makarand Paranjape

==&quot;Kanthapura&quot;==

Raja Rao&#x27;s first and best-known novel, &quot;Kanthapura&quot; (1938), is the story of a south Indian village named Kanthapura. The novel is narrated in the form of a Sthala Purana by an old woman of the village, Achakka. Dominant castes like Brahmins are privileged to get the best region of the village, while lower castes such as Pariahs are marginalized. Despite this classist system, the village retains its long-cherished traditions of festivals in which all castes interact and the villagers are united. The village is believed to be protected by a local deity named Kenchamma.

The main character of the novel, Moorthy, is a young Brahmin who leaves for the city to study, where he becomes familiar with Gandhian philosophy. He begins living a Gandhian lifestyle, wearing home-spun khaddar and discarded foreign clothes and speaking out against the caste system. This causes the village priest to turn against Moorthy and excommunicate him. Heartbroken to hear this, Moorthy&#x27;s mother Narasamma dies. After this, Moorthy starts living with an educated widow, Rangamma, who is active in India&#x27;s independence movement.

Moorthy is then invited by Brahmin clerks at the Skeffington coffee estate to create an awareness of Gandhian teachings among the pariah coolies. When Moorthy arrives, he is beaten by the policeman Bade Khan, but the coolies stand up for Moorthy and beat Bade Khan - an action for which they are thrown out of the estate. Moorthy continues his fight against injustice and social inequality and becomes a staunch ally of Gandhi. Although he is depressed over violence at the estate, he takes responsibility and goes on a three-day fast and emerges morally elated. A unit of the independence committee is formed in Kanthapura, with office bearers vowing to follow Gandhi&#x27;s teachings under Moorthy&#x27;s leadership.

The British government accuses Moorthy of provoking the townspeople to inflict violence and arrests him. Though the committee is willing to pay his bail, Moorthy refuses their money. While Moorthy spends the next three months in prison, the women of Kanthapura take charge, forming a volunteer corps under Rangamma&#x27;s leadership. Rangamma instills a sense of patriotism among the women by telling them stories of notable women from Indian history. They face police brutality, including assault and rape, when the village is attacked and burned. Upon Moorthy&#x27;s release from prison, he has lost his faith in Gandhian principles as he sees most of the land of his village has been sold to city dwellers of Bombay and the village has changed beyond repair.

<text>David Michael Rorvik (born 1943) is an American journalist and novelist who was the author of the 1978 book &quot;In his Image: The Cloning of a Man&quot; in which he claimed to have been part of a successful endeavor to create a clone of a human being. The book is widely considered to be a hoax.

==Biography==

Rorvik was born in Circle, Montana. He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Montana in 1966 and a M.S. &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1967. He worked as a science writer and a medical reporter for &quot;Time&quot; and contributed articles to numerous publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and wrote several books.

In a 1969 magazine article, Rorvik outlined the Shettles Method to influence the sex of a child. Two years later, he and Landrum B. Shettles co-authored the bestselling book &quot;Your Baby&#x27;s Sex: Now You Can Choose&quot;. In 1976, Rorvik was awarded an Alicia Patterson Foundation Fellowship for investigatory reporting on the politics of cancer research worldwide. Some of his findings from this investigation were reported on in Harper&#x27;s Magazine, the Washington Post and other publications. Earlier in his career, he was the recipient of a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship for investigation of the effects of apartheid politics in Africa on press freedoms.

==&quot;In his Image&quot;==

In &quot;In his Image&quot;, Rorvik claimed that in 1973 a wealthy businessman he dubbed &quot;Max&quot; had contacted him and recruited him to find scientists willing to create a clone of him. Rorvik claims to have formed a scientific team that was taken to a lab at a secret location. After a few years of experimentation they managed to implant a specially prepared body cell nucleus into the cytoplast of a human ovum (a technique known as somatic cell nuclear transfer) and, in turn, succeeded in implanting this egg into the uterus of a surrogate mother, a local resident called &quot;Sparrow.&quot; A healthy child, it was claimed, was born nine months later. He stated in the book that he was able to tell the story only on the condition that he safeguard the identities of all involved and cautioned his readers that the book did not provide proof that the cloning had occurred, although he stated he was convinced that it had.

Before the book was published, the &quot;New York Post&quot; learned of the story and made it front-page news on March 3, 1978. Soon after, NBC&#x27;s Tom Brokaw interviewed Rorvik on &quot;The Today Show&quot;. The book was very popular and caused much discussion about the ethics of cloning. However, scientists including Yale University professor Clement Markert generally disbelieved Rorvik&#x27;s claims. Efforts to clone mammals had not been undertaken at that time and it was widely assumed that there would be enormous obstacles to achieving successful mammalian cloning.

British scientist Derek Bromhall filed a $7,000,000 defamation suit against Rorvik&#x27;s publisher, J. B. Lippincott, alleging that the book was a hoax, that it incorporated parts of his doctoral thesis as the theoretical basis for the cloning process, and that it had used his name without permission. When Rorvik refused to reveal the identity of &quot;Max&quot; or provide proof of the existence of the clone, judge John Fullam found that the book was a &quot;fraud and a hoax&quot; in a pretrial ruling. The case went to trial in 1982, with the charges being reduced to invasion of privacy. The publisher soon entered into an out-of-court settlement that included a payment of $100,000 and a public representation that the book was a hoax. No evidence, however, was presented in pre-trial proceedings, during the trial, or thereafter that established either the truthfulness or the falsity of the book. Rorvik himself denied that there had been any hoax, and refused either to be party to the out-of-court settlement or to contribute to it financially. He wrote an article defending &quot;In his Image&quot; for &quot;Omni&quot; in 1980.

Rorvik has since written, ghost-written, edited and agented several books on diet and nutrition, psychology and other topics, including the &quot;Physician Desk Reference for Nutritional Supplements&quot; (2001). In 2006, a sixth edition of &quot;Your Baby&#x27;s Sex: Now You Can Choose&quot; was published, marking nearly 40 years of continuous print.

<doc id="1079161" wikidata="Q988129" url="?curid=1079161" title="Mary Whiton Calkins">
<text>Mary Whiton Calkins (; 30 March 1863 – 26 February 1930) was an American philosopher and psychologist, whose work informed theory and research of memory, dreams and the self. In 1903, Calkins was the twelfth in a listing of fifty psychologists with the most merit, chosen by her peers. Calkins was refused a Ph.D. by Harvard University because of her gender.

Calkins is a key figure in the history of women psychologists. At Wellesley College, Calkins established the first psychological laboratory for women. She was the first woman to complete the requirements for a doctoral degree in psychology with the unanimous support of the Harvard University psychology faculty, although the university refused to bestow it on the grounds that Harvard did not accept women. She later became president of the American Psychological Association and the American Philosophical Association, and was the first woman to be president of both.

She taught psychology and philosophy at Wellesley College for four decades, and conducted research there and at Harvard University for the majority of that time.

==Background==
Mary Whiton Calkins was born on March 30, 1863, in Hartford, Connecticut. She was the eldest of eight children. Her parents were Wolcott and Charlotte Whiton Calkins. Mary was close with her family. In 1880, she moved to Newton, Massachusetts with her family to begin her education and remained there for the rest of her life. Her family moved from New York to Massachusetts because her father, who was a Presbyterian minister, got a new job there.

Since Mary&#x27;s father took an active role in overseeing his children&#x27;s education and planned her studies, she was able to enroll in college when she graduated high school. In 1882, Calkins entered Smith College as a sophomore. She studied there for a year. Following the death of her sister in 1883, she took a year off from college and learned by herself. While taking time off from school, Calkins received private tutoring lessons in Greece. During this year, she also tutored two of her brothers. She returned to Smith College in 1884 to graduate with a degree in classics and philosophy.

Upon graduation, Calkins and her family took an eighteen-month trip to Europe, and she was able to explore Leipzig, Italy, and Greece. As she was majoring in classics, Calkins took advantage of the opportunities and spent several months travelling and studying modern Greek and classics. When she returned to Massachusetts, her father set up an interview with the President of Wellesley College, an all women&#x27;s college, for a tutoring job in the Greek department. She worked as a tutor and eventually as a teacher in the Greek department for three years. A professor in the philosophy department noticed Calkins&#x27; excellent teaching and offered her a position to teach psychology, which was new to the philosophy department&#x27;s curriculum. Calkins accepted the offer on the contingency that she would be able to study psychology for one year.

Although women had had more educational opportunities to attend and teach at colleges back then, Calkins still faced sexism in the field and didn&#x27;t have many options to earn a degree in psychology. She considered psychology programs at the University of Michigan with John Dewey, Yale University with George Trumbull Ladd, Clark University with Granville Stanley Hall, and Harvard University with William James. She expressed interest in studying in a laboratory setting, a specification of which only Clark University and Harvard University had at the time. She sought admission to Harvard most likely due to its proximity to her home in Newton. Harvard did not permit women to study at their institution, but it allowed her to sit in on lectures after her father and Wellesley&#x27;s president had sent letters asking for her admittance. Calkins decided to take classes at Harvard Annex (predecessor of Radcliffe College), taught by Josiah Royce.

== Career ==
Calkins published four books and over one hundred papers in her career, in both the fields of psychology and philosophy. Calkins was interested in memory and later in the concept of the self. She is best known for her accomplishments within the field of psychology and her struggles to achieve. After being rejected for a degree from Harvard, Calkins continued to work and strive for equality.

In 1903, Calkins ranked twelfth in a listing of fifty top-ranked psychologists, an achievement that happened after James McKeen Cattell asked ten psychologists to rank their American colleagues in order of merit.

=== Initial psychological training ===
Royce influenced Calkins to take classes taught by William James in Harvard, with men as her peers. However, Harvard president Charles William Eliot opposed this idea of a woman learning in the same room as a man. With pressure from James and Royce, along with a petition from Calkins&#x27; father, Eliot allowed her to study in the classes, with the stipulation that she was a guest, and not a registered student.

Calkins began her serious study of psychology under William James, shortly after his highly renowned textbook, The Principles of Psychology was printed in 1890. Calkins highly regards one of her first experiences with James in her autobiography, stating:
Although Calkins was very impressed by James&#x27; philosophies and he had initiated her into the field of psychology, James was not an experimentalist, and that was more of Calkins&#x27; area of interest. However, she claims that ultimately it was James&#x27; doctrines of the transitive feelings of relation, the feelings of &quot;and&quot;, &quot;if&quot;, and &quot;but&quot;, and the concept of consciousness as tending to the &quot;personal form,&quot; which could have been what began her major interest in the self.

While studying with James, Calkins had first suggested attention as a topic for one of her papers, however, she said that James had frowned upon that since he was sick of the subject. Her topic of association was arbitrarily chosen, and became one of the major interests of her psychological career.

=== Experimental psychology ===
Following her training under James, Calkins worked alongside Edmund Sanford of Clark University, who later assisted her in setting up the first psychology laboratory run by women at Wellesley College. Sanford trained Calkins on experimental laboratory procedures, as well as helped in the creation and assembly of numerous laboratory instruments for Wellesley&#x27;s psychological laboratory.

When Calkins was tutored by Sanford, she was allowed to conduct a research project that involved studying the contents of Sanford and her dreams recorded throughout a seven-week period. She recorded 205 dreams and Sanford 170. They woke themselves by using alarm clocks at different hours of the night and recorded their dreams at the instant of waking. They slept with a notepad right beside their bed to allow note-taking of dreams as quickly as possible. Each morning, they studied all the records regardless of whether they seemed slight and trivial, or significant. They also took account of the different types of dreams and they discovered elements of various emotions.

As part of the project, also considered was the relation of the dream to the conscious, waking life, distinguishing the individuals and places in their dream experiences. Calkins explains in her autobiography that the dream &quot;merely reproduces in general the persons and places of recent sense perception and that is it rarely associated with that which is of paramount significance in one&#x27;s waking experience&quot;. Calkins and Sanford address the loss of identity in dreams as &quot;not a loss but a change or a doubling of self-consciousness ... yet all the time one is conscious that it is oneself who has changed or whose identity is doubled&quot;.

Calkins&#x27; research was cited by Sigmund Freud when he created his conception of the dream. She also claimed that Freudians at the time were &quot;superficially concerned with the &#x27;manifest content&#x27; of dreams&quot;. The results of a recent study done by Montangero and Cavallero (2015) suggest that the consecutive events of the dreams of their participants were rarely plausible, and often seemed to have no relation to one another. This suggests that dreams have little hidden meaning, and supports the findings of Calkin&#x27;s original dream study.

==== Psychological laboratory and courses at Wellesley ====
In 1891, Calkins returned to Wellesley as an instructor of psychology in the philosophy department. 12 years after the first psychology laboratory was established by Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig, Germany, Calkins established the first psychology lab to be founded by a woman in 1891, and the first lab to be established at a women&#x27;s college. The lab was funded by $200, while all other labs were funded by $800 or more. Calkins had many of the apparatuses constructed at nearby venues. Her lab was in the attic spaces of the fifth floor of College Hall in Wellesley College. After the laboratory was established, it quickly gained popularity; her first course on &quot;psychology approached from the physiological standpoint&quot; yielded over fifty students. These students were instructed in some areas of psychology and conducted experiments on such subjects as sensation and association.

A fire broke out in a nearby physics lab, which burned down Calkins&#x27;s laboratory among with others. No students or instructors were injured in the fire, but the first psychology laboratory established by a woman was destroyed. The laboratory was rebuilt, and Eleanor Gamble later succeeded Calkins in running it.

=== Further education ===
When Calkins began to make plans for furthering her education in psychology, advice from Sanford discouraged her from schools like Johns Hopkins and Clark, suggesting they were not likely to admit women as students much like her experience at Harvard. Sanford did encourage Calkins to explore sex programs in Europe, making an inference that Hugo Münsterberg admitted female students to his laboratory in Freiburg, Germany (after seeing a picture of Münsterberg in his lab with a woman). After expressing her desire to work with Münsterberg to James, she learned from him that Münsterberg would soon be coming to work at Harvard.

In the three years that Calkins studied under Münsterberg, several of her papers were published, including research she conducted with Sanford on dreams and her first paper on association. In her autobiography, she describes Münsterberg as &quot;a man of deep learning, high originality, and astounding versatility.&quot;

Other work with Münsterberg included their dream study. Hugo would begin by training her in the detail of laboratory experiments, giving her a research problem based on records that the two of them had taken of their dreams over several weeks. Over those weeks they would wake themselves with alarm clocks at different hours of the night, recorded their dreams, and then studied them intensely. The conclusion they reached was that dreams were nothing more than reproductions of &quot;the persons, places, and events of recent sense perception.&quot;

The discrimination she experienced due to her sex was also illustrated in earlier episodes. In her autobiography, Calkins reminisces on a date in which, as a member of the executive committee of the American Psychological Association, Munsterberg and his students, including Calkins, were to attend a lunch meeting of the Committee at the Harvard Union. The waiter there, though, protested the group&#x27;s entrance stating that &quot;no woman might set foot in the main hall; nor was it possible to admit so many men, balanced solely by one woman, to the ladies&#x27; dining-room.&quot; Although it seems like Calkins had a constant struggle as a female in her field, she expressed in her autobiography her gratitude for the individuals that did not discriminate against her. The &quot;friendly, comradely, and refreshingly matter-of-fact welcome&quot; that she received from the men working in Munsterberg&#x27;s laboratory as assistants and students are described in her book with great appreciation. She also expressed her indebtedness to Munsterberg who &quot;swung the Laboratory doors&quot; open to her without hesitation.

==== Doctoral research ====
During this time, Calkins also studied memory, leading to her invention of the right associate&#x27;s method, now known as the paired-associations technique. Calkins explains in her autobiography that &quot;by showing series of colors paired with numerals, I found that a numeral which has repeatedly appeared in conjunction with a given color was more likely than either a vividly colored numeral or than the numeral last paired with the color, to be remembered, on a reappearance of the given color&quot;.

A series of Calkins&#x27; experiments under Hugo Münsterberg, taking place between 1894 and 1896, was concerned with the concept of recency as it relates to a person&#x27;s ability to remember something. Her paired-associates technique showed that recency yields to the vividness, and both vividness and recency yields to frequency. Her method consisted of showing a series of colors paired with numerals, followed by testing for recall of the numbers when the colors with which they were previously paired are flashed again. The findings of her study revealed that numbers paired with bright colors were retained better than those associated with neutral colors. Yet, the prime factor influencing memory was not color but the frequency of exposure.

Calkins described the technical memorizing method that she used, known as &quot;paired-associations&quot;, as even more significant than the results of the experiment. The formula where a subject is presented with a stimulus and asked to provide the appropriate response became a standard tool for studying human learning. Although Georg Elias Müller criticized her method, he refined and adopted it, calling it () and it has been widely used ever since. Edward B. Titchener included her research in his &quot;Student&#x27;s Manual,&quot; and in her autobiography, Calkins refers to a Professor Kline who selected the paired-associates method for his textbook, &quot;Psychology By Experiment.&quot; The paired-associates technique was also included in psychology textbooks published by Herrnstein and Boring. Although the paired-associates technique is regarded as one of Calkins&#x27; biggest contributions to psychology, Calkins herself did not attach very much importance to this work.

It is suggested that, despite Calkins often downplaying the memory implications of her research, her writings &quot;constitute a truly remarkable legacy ... [they] represent important, basic, replicable phenomena that are fundamentally important.&quot;

Her study on paired associates learning under Münsterberg constituted her doctoral dissertation which was published in 1896. Harvard refused to approve the unanimous recommendation of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology to grant Calkins her doctoral degree. Eliot believed strongly that the two sexes should be educated separately and, although he allowed Calkins to be a &quot;guest,&quot; he and the rest of the board refused to grant her the degree. Calkins had completed all of the requirements for the Ph.D., including passing exams and completing a dissertation, and all of her Harvard professors had recommended her for the degree. Yet, solely due to her gender, she was denied the honour of a conferred degree. James was astonished and described her performance as &quot;the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard.&quot;

Although the qualification has never been officially conferred, Calkins was the first woman to complete all the coursework, examinations, and research for a doctoral degree.

Calkins&#x27; most notable instance of social justice for women was her rejection of a PhD from Radcliffe, a women&#x27;s college in association with Harvard. In 1902, Radcliffe offered doctoral degrees to Calkins and three other women who had completed their studies at Harvard but were not granted PhDs due to their gender. The three other women accepted the degree, and Munsterberg urged Calkins that she should also accept, claiming a PhD from Radcliffe held the same weight as a PhD from Harvard. Calkins rejected Radcliffe&#x27;s offer, stating in a letter to the Radcliffe board:
Despite ongoing petitioning, as of 2015 Harvard University continues to refuse to posthumously award her with a doctoral degree.

=== Later work ===
With her supplemental education completed, she returned to Wellesley in 1895 as an associate professor of psychology. Two years after her return she became a professor of psychology and philosophy. This addition allowed her to return to her lectures on the classics and Greek. Her experimental work continued throughout this time.

Calkins&#x27; first textbook, &quot;An Introduction to Psychology,&quot; was published in 1901&quot;. The Persistent Problems of Philosophy&quot; (1907) and &quot;The Good Man and The Good&quot; (1918) were two publications in which she expressed her philosophical views.

In 1905 she was elected president of the American Psychological Association and the American Philosophical Association in 1918. She was the first woman to hold a position in both societies. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1909 from the University of Columbia and a Doctorate of Laws in 1910 from Smith College. She was also the first woman elected to honorary membership on the British Psychological Association.

==== The self ====
One of her contributions to psychology was her system of self-psychology. Beginning in 1900, Calkins began to publish a series of papers in which she described psychology as a &quot;science of the self&quot; – this would be a premise to the development of her system of self-psychology. She spent many years trying to define the idea of the self, but she concluded that she could in no way define it. She stated that even though the self was indefinable, it was &quot;a totality, one of many characters... a unique being in the sense that I am I and you are you ...&quot;

In a time when there were several schools of thought, Calkins established the school of self-psychology. This became quite unpopular and controversial as many psychologists did not feel the &quot;self&quot; or &quot;soul&quot; was relevant. At the time, the main schools of psychology were structuralism and functionalism, which were quite competitive with one another; statements made by one school could expect a strong rebuttal from the other. Self-psychology was influenced by William James&#x27; theory of the idea of multiple selves (including the material self, social self, and spiritual self), and a particular interest to Calkin&#x27;s, Josiah Royce&#x27;s theory that humans define themselves through interpersonal communication.

She spent a great deal of time working with the system of self-psychology, critically examining the self from both philosophical and psychological viewpoints. Over her many years of study, Calkins wrote many books and articles on the topic of self-psychology. Over the years she spent working on the system, it was widely unpopular, which is why she is less often remembered for her work relating to it. Despite its lack of appreciation, Calkin&#x27;s refused to lose interest in the subject, which is described as &quot;the science of conscious selves.&quot; By way of studying self-psychology, she was able to form descriptions of the self, such as the self that remains the same, the self that is changed, the unique self, and a few other descriptions. She would go on to discuss self-psychology during the entirety of her career, mentioning it in some of her books, one of which is &quot;A First Book in Psychology.&quot;

Her reasoning for self-psychology being so unpopular was a notion that &quot;one is so constantly aware of one&#x27;s self that one might understandably overlook it when reporting on a sensational experience,&quot; and adding that it led to a lack of reference to the self in introspective studies. She also suggested that the system was not well taken by fellow psychologists or scientists, one of which being confusion over the self&#x27;s relationship with the soul, which she discusses in her article, &quot;The Case of Self Against Soul&quot; in 1917. In this article, she explains that our soul should be considered life itself. She would take to theoretical arguments to promote her system, noting its organizing role within psychology. Calkins defined the three basal concepts in self-psychology to be the subject, the object, and the relation between the subject and the object. Calkins distinguished self-psychology from the predominant schools of atomism, behaviorism, Gestalt-psychology, and psychophysical personalism, while still maintaining that self-psychology could incorporate the
central tenets espoused by these schools.

Calkins considered her self-psychology to be a form of introspectionist psychology, involving examining one&#x27;s own mental experience. She believed that causing someone to think introspectively could help in multiple aspects of their life including religion, their morals, and various other aspects in the mind that otherwise may not be thought of. Introspectionistic psychology was composed of two schools: impersonalistic, which denied the &quot;self&quot; in its definition of psychology, and personalistic, which defined psychology as the study of consciousness, functioning, experiencing selves. Calkins&#x27; conviction was that a laboratory was essential for adequate instruction in psychology. Calkins claimed that self-psychology could be experimentally investigated, but did not personally involve herself in laboratory experiments relating to self-psychology. Calkins desired that her school of self-psychology would be a theory on which functionals and structuralists could find common ground.

Calkins&#x27; self-psychology did not live without criticism from fellow psychologists of the era. James Angell, a founding father of functionalism, opposed Calkins&#x27; neglect of the body as part of the self. Following Calkins&#x27; Presidential Address (of the American Psychological Association), where Calkins publicly outlined self-psychology, he claims: &quot;Such as functional psychology as I have been presenting would be entirely reconcilable with Miss Calkins&#x27; &#x27;psychology of selves&#x27; ... were it not for her extreme scientific conservatism in refusing to allow the self to have a body ... The real psychological self, as I understand her, is pure disembodied spirit - an admirable thing of good religious and philosophic ancestry, but surely not the thing before which psychology is under any obligation to know&quot;. This was written despite its inaccuracy; Calkins did in fact leave considerable room for the body in her address, taking sensorimotor processes and physiological phenomena into account, however, she did not consider the body as an essential &quot;basal fact&quot; of psychology.

== Personal life ==
Outside of her contributions to the field of psychology, Calkins was an avid supporter of women&#x27;s rights. Calkins was a suffragist, disputing &quot;in a democratic country, governed as this is by the suffrage of its citizens, and given over as this is to the principle and practice of educating women, a distinction based on the difference of sex is artificial and illogical&quot;. Calkins was a pacifist and a member of the American Civil Liberties Union. While working at Wellesley around the time of World War I, a colleague of Calkins was fired for holding pacifistic views. Calkins offered her resignation, stating she held the same views as her colleague who was terminated, but her resignation from Wellesley was not accepted by the President or board.

As it can be seen in her writings, although she was very grateful for the individuals who accepted her, she did not hold resentment against those who did not. For instance, instead of expressing disdain towards the Harvard board for not accepting her application for a degree, she conveyed her appreciation toward Harvard for allowing her to partake in the courses, conduct research under her professors, and work with individuals such as James, Sanford and Münsterberg. She also mentions the assistance of figures such as Robert MacDougall and several others who spent years with her as her mechanicians, subjects, counselors, and even friends. In addition, when the episode with the waiter refusing her admission took place, she stated in her autobiography that &quot;he correctly insisted against her admission.&quot;

Calkins served as a faculty member at Wellesley College for forty years until she retired in 1929. Calkins died in 1930 after writing four books and over a hundred papers that are evenly divided between the fields of psychology and philosophy.

<text>James &quot;Jemmy&quot; Hirst (1738–1829) was an English eccentric.

Hirst was born to a farmer family of Rawcliffe, Yorkshire. Even at school he kept a pet jackdaw and trained a hedgehog to follow him around. His parents&#x27; hope that he would become a priest never materialised when he was thrown out of school for his pranks. Hirst was apprenticed to a tanner, fell in love with his daughter and became engaged to her.

Reputedly Hirst&#x27;s eccentricity began when his betrothed died of smallpox after he rescued her from a flooding river. At first Hirst retired to his bed and reputedly contracted &quot;brain fever&quot;. When he recovered (apparently), he continued his habits of animal training. His first success was his later favourite, a bull he named &quot;Jupiter&quot; and trained to behave as a horse so he could ride him and use him to pull his carriage. The carriage itself was made of wicker, had unusually big wheels and looked like a lampshade upside down. It also had an odometer of Hirst&#x27;s own design that would ring a bell after a mile of travel. When Jupiter found it hard to pull, Hirst fitted it with sails. The experiment was unsuccessful and the carriage crashed into a shop window in Pontefract; Hirst was banned from the town.

Hirst rode Jupiter in a fox hunt, using pigs as pointers instead of dogs. He tried to train an otter to fish - but getting the otter to let go of his catch was too hard. He went to Doncaster races dressed in a lambskin hat with a nine-foot brim and a waistcoat of duck feathers. Hirst also blew his hunting horn to summon the poor and the elderly to his house for tea. Sometimes the visitors found that the refreshments were served from their host&#x27;s favourite coffin. Hirst hung the walls of his house with bits of old rope and iron and wrote doggerel verse. Eventually he married his housekeeper; during the ceremony he wore a toga and insisted that the formalities should be conducted in sign language. However, he did make a profitable trade of his produce and increased his wealth. His farm was the one at the North end of Chapel Lane. The farmhouse is still there but the stack yard behind it has been built on. His grave is in Rawcliffe churchyard.

Hirst&#x27;s fame grew enough that King George III was intrigued and invited him to visit London. At first Hirst sent a reply that he was busy trying to train otters to fish, but would come later. When he arrived in his carriage he attracted much attention in his flamboyant costume. During his visit, one noble began to laugh. Hirst proceeded to throw a goblet of water in his face because he was clearly &quot;having hysterics&quot;. He announced that he was pleased to find his monarch a &quot;plain-looking fellow&quot; and invited him to visit him in Rawcliffe for a good brandy. The king did not oblige, but reputedly gave him a number of bottles from the royal wine cellar.

Jemmy Hirst died in 1829. His will left £12 to twelve old maids who were to follow his coffin and two musicians, a fiddler and a bagpiper, who were to play happy songs. Only two old maids obliged. The priest did not let the piper play anything but &quot;O&#x27;er the hills and far away&quot; and forbade the fiddler from playing anything at all. He also left his accountant a piece of rope to &quot;go hang himself with&quot;. Rumour claims that Hirst had had his own coffin built with windows and shelves, which he kept in his front room and charged people to sit in.

In his memory there is a pub in Rawcliffe near Goole named &quot;Jemmy Hirst at The Rose and Crown&quot;.

<doc id="1079171" wikidata="Q284994" url="?curid=1079171" title="Carneades">
<text>Carneades (; , &quot;Karneadēs&quot;, &quot;of Carnea&quot;; 214/3–129/8 BC) was a Greek philosopher, perhaps the most prominent head of the Skeptical Academy in ancient Greece. He was born in Cyrene. By the year 159 BC, he had begun to attack many previous dogmatic doctrines, especially Stoicism and even the Epicureans, whom previous skeptics had spared.

As scholarch (leader) of the Academy, he was one of three philosophers sent to Rome in 155 BC where his lectures on the uncertainty of justice caused consternation among leading politicians. He left no writings. Many of his opinions are known only via his successor Clitomachus. He seems to have doubted the ability not just of the senses but of reason too in acquiring truth. His skepticism was, however, moderated by the belief that we can, nevertheless, ascertain probabilities (not in the sense of statistical probability, but in the sense of persuasiveness) of truth, to enable us to act.

==Biography==
Carneades, the son of Epicomus or Philokomus, was born at Cyrene, North Africa in 214/213 BC. He migrated early to Athens. There he attended the lectures of the Stoics, learning their logic from Diogenes of Babylon and studying the works of Chrysippus. He subsequently focused his efforts on refuting the Stoics, attaching himself to the Platonic Academy, which had suffered from the attacks of the Stoics. On the death of Hegesinus of Pergamon, he was chosen scholarch (head) of the Academy. His great eloquence and skill in argument revived the glories of the Academic Skeptics. He asserted nothing (not even that nothing can be asserted), and carried on a vigorous argument against every dogma maintained by other sects.

In the year 155 BC, when he was fifty-eight years old, he was chosen with the Stoic Diogenes of Babylon and the Peripatetic Critolaus to go as ambassadors to Rome to deprecate the fine of 500 talents which had been imposed on the Athenians for the destruction of Oropus. During his stay at Rome, he attracted great notice from his eloquent speeches on philosophical subjects. It was here that, in the presence of Cato the Elder, he delivered his several orations on justice. The first oration was in commendation of the virtue of Roman justice. The next day he delivered the second oration, in which he refuted all the arguments he had made the day before. He persuasively attempted to prove that justice was inevitably problematic, and not a given when it came to virtue, but merely a compact device deemed necessary for the maintenance of a well-ordered society. This oration shocked Cato. Recognizing the potential danger of Carneades&#x27; arguments, Cato moved the Roman Senate to send Carneades back to Athens to prevent Roman youth from being exposed to a re-examining of Roman doctrines. Carneades lived twenty-seven years after this at Athens.

Due to Carneades&#x27; ill health, he was succeeded as scholarch by Polemarchus of Nicomedia (137/136 BC), who died 131/130 BC and was succeeded by Crates of Tarsus. Crates died in 127/126 BC and was succeeded by Clitomachus. Carneades died in 129/128 BC, at the advanced age of 85 (although Cicero says 90).

Carneades is described as a man of unwearied industry. He was so engrossed in his studies, that he let his hair and nails grow to an immoderate length, and was so absent at his own table (for he would never dine out), that his servant and concubine, Melissa, was constantly obliged to feed him. Latin writer and author Valerius Maximus, to whom we owe the last anecdote, tells us that Carneades, before discussing with Chrysippus, was wont to purge himself with hellebore, to have a sharper mind. In his old age, he suffered from cataract in his eyes, which he bore with great impatience, and was so little resigned to the decay of nature, that he used to ask angrily, if this was the way in which nature undid what she had done, and sometimes expressed a wish to poison himself.

==Philosophy==
Carneades is known as an Academic Skeptic. Academic Skeptics (so called because this was the type of skepticism taught in Plato&#x27;s Academy in Athens) hold that all knowledge is impossible, except for the knowledge that all other knowledge is impossible.

Carneades left no writings, and all that is known of his lectures is derived from his intimate friend and pupil, Clitomachus; but so true was he to his own principles of withholding assent, that Clitomachus confesses he never could ascertain what his master really thought on any subject. In ethics, which more particularly were the subject of his long and laborious study, he seems to have denied the conformity of the moral ideas with nature. This he particularly insisted on in the second oration on Justice, in which he manifestly wished to convey his own notions on the subject; and he there maintains that ideas of justice are not derived from nature, but that they are purely artificial for purposes of expediency.

All this, however, was nothing but the special application of his general theory, that people did not possess, and never could possess, any criterion of truth.

Carneades argued that, if there were a criterion, it must exist either in reason (&quot;logos&quot;), or (&quot;aisthêsis&quot;), or conception (&quot;phantasia&quot;). But then reason itself depends on conception, and this again on sensation; and we have no means of judging whether our sensations are true or false, whether they correspond to the objects that produce them, or carry wrong impressions to the mind, producing false conceptions and ideas, and leading reason also into error. Therefore, sensation, conception, and reason, are alike disqualified for being the criterion of truth.

But after all, people must live and act, and must have some rule of practical life; therefore, although it is impossible to pronounce anything as absolutely true, we may yet establish probabilities of various degrees. For, although we cannot say that any given conception or sensation is in itself true, yet some sensations appear to us more true than others, and we must be guided by that which seems the most true. Again, sensations are not single, but generally combined with others, which either confirm or contradict them; and the greater this combination the greater is the probability of that being true which the rest combine to confirm; and the case in which the greatest number of conceptions, each in themselves apparently most true, should combine to affirm that which also in itself appears most true, would present to Carneades the highest probability, and his nearest approach to truth.

<text>The Lopper Road Tunnel is a tunnel in central Switzerland. The tunnel connects Hergiswil in the canton of Nidwalden with Alpnach in the canton of Obwalden, and forms part of the A8 motorway. The tunnel was opened in 1984, and is long. The tunnel has two lanes (one in each direction), and there is no central reservation. The tunnel runs under the Lopper, a shoulder of Mount Pilatus which extends into Lake Lucerne.

The northern portal of the Lopper Tunnel is near to that of the Kirchenwald Tunnel on the A2 motorway, and most of the junction between the two motorways lies to the north of their respective portals. However the link for westbound traffic from the A2 to the A8 utilises a long single-lane link tunnel within the mountain between the two main motorway tunnels.

The Lopper I railway tunnel, on the Zentralbahn Brünig line, parallels the Lopper road tunnel. The Lopper II railway tunnel, on the Zentralbahn Luzern–Stans–Engelberg line, parallels the Kirchenwald road tunnel.

<text>Paul Carus (; 18 July 1852 – 11 February 1919) was a German-American author, editor, a student of comparative religion and philosopher.

==Life and education==

Carus was born in Ilsenburg, Germany, and educated at the universities of Strassburg (then Germany, now France) and Tübingen, Germany. After obtaining his PhD from Tübingen in 1876 he served in the army and then taught school. He had been raised in a pious and orthodox Protestant home, but gradually moved away from this tradition.

He left Bismarck&#x27;s Imperial Germany for the United States, &quot;because of his liberal views&quot;. After he emigrated to the USA (in 1884) he lived in Chicago, and in LaSalle, Illinois. Paul Carus married Edward C. Hegeler&#x27;s daughter, engineer Mary Hegeler (Marie) and the couple later moved into the Hegeler Carus Mansion, built by her father. They had seven children, the firstborn, Robert died at birth, but Edward (b. 1890), Gustave (b. 1892), Paula (b. 1894), Elisabeth or &quot;Libby&quot; (b. 1896), Herman (b. 1899), and Alwin (b. 1901) all lived long lives. Mary ran the family business, Matthiessen-Hegeler Zinc Company and the Open Court business and later took on the editorial role after Carus&#x27; death, alongside their daughter Elizabeth.

==Career==
In the United States, Carus briefly edited a German-language journal and wrote several articles for the &quot;Index&quot;, the Free Religious Association organ.

Soon after, he became the first managing editor of the Open Court Publishing Company, founded in 1887 by his father-in-law. The goals of Open Court were to provide a forum for the discussion of philosophy, science, and religion, and to make philosophical classics widely available by making them affordable.

He also acted as the editor for two periodicals published by the company, &quot;The Open Court&quot; and &quot;The Monist&quot;.

He was introduced to Charles Sanders Peirce, the founder of American Pragmatism, by Judge Francis C. Russell of Chicago. Carus stayed abreast of Peirce&#x27;s work and would eventually publish a number of his articles.

During his lifetime, Carus published 75 books and 1500 articles, mostly through Open Court Publishing Company. He wrote books and articles on history, politics, philosophy, religion, logic, mathematics, anthropology, science, and social issues of his day. In addition, Carus corresponded with many of the greatest minds of the late 19th and early 20th century, sending and receiving letters from Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Booker T. Washington, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Ernst Mach, Ernst Haeckel, John Dewey, and many more.

==Carus&#x27;s world view and philosophy==
Carus considered himself a theologian rather than philosopher. He referred to himself as &quot;an atheist who loved God&quot;.

Carus is proposed to be a pioneer in the promotion of interfaith dialogue. He explored the relationship of science and religion, and was instrumental in introducing Eastern traditions and ideas to the West. He was a key figure in the introduction of Buddhism to the West, sponsoring Buddhist translation work of D.T. Suzuki, and fostering a lifelong working friendship with Buddhist Master, Soyen Shaku. Carus&#x27; interest in Asian religions seems to have intensified after he attended the World&#x27;s Parliament of Religions (in 1893).

For years afterwards, Carus was a strong sympathizer of Buddhist ideas, but stopped short of committing fully to this, or any other, religion. Instead, he ceaselessly promoted his own rational concept which he called the &quot;Religion of Science.&quot; Carus had a selective approach and he believed that religions evolve over time. After a battle for survival, he expected a &quot;cosmic religion of universal truth&quot; to emerge from the ashes of traditional beliefs.

Carus proposed his own philosophy similar to panpsychism known as &#x27;panbiotism&#x27;, which he defined as &quot;everything is fraught with life; it contains life; it has the ability to live.&quot;
===Religion of Science===
Carus was a follower of Benedictus de Spinoza; he was of the opinion that Western thought had fallen into error early in its development in accepting the distinctions between body and mind and the material and the spiritual. (Kant&#x27;s phenomenal and noumenal realms of knowledge; Christianity&#x27;s views of the soul and the body, and the natural and the supernatural). Carus rejected such dualisms, and wanted science to reestablish the unity of knowledge. The philosophical result he labeled &quot;Monism&quot;.

His version of &quot;monism&quot; is more closely associated with a kind of pantheism, although it was occasionally identified with positivism. He regarded every law of nature as a part of God&#x27;s being. Carus held that God was the name for a &quot;cosmic order&quot; comprising &quot;all that which is the bread of our spiritual life.&quot; He held the concept of a personal God as untenable. He acknowledged Jesus Christ as a redeemer, but not as the only one, for he believed that other religious founders were equally endowed with similar qualities.

His beliefs attempted to steer a middle course between idealistic metaphysics and materialism. He differed with metaphysicians because they &quot;&quot; words and treated them as if they were realities, and he objected to materialism because it ignored or overlooked the importance of form. Carus emphasized form by conceiving of the divinity as a cosmic order. He objected to any monism which sought the unity of the world, not in the unity of truth, but in the oneness of a logical assumption of ideas. He referred to such concepts as &quot;henism&quot;, not monism.

Carus held that truth was independent of time, human desire, and human action. Therefore, science was not a human invention, but a human revelation which needed to be apprehended; discovery meant apprehension; it was the result or manifestation of the cosmic order in which all truths were ultimately harmonious.

===Criticisms of Carus&#x27; ideas===
It is claimed that Carus was dismissed by Orientalists and philosophers alike because of his failure to comply with the rules of either discipline.

==Legacy==
The legacy of Paul Carus is honored through the efforts of the &quot;Hegeler Carus Foundation&quot;, the &quot;Carus Lectures&quot; at the &quot;American Philosophical Association (APA)&quot;, and the &quot;Paul Carus Award for Interreligious Understanding&quot; by the &quot;Council for a Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions (CPWR)&quot;. Mary Hegeler Carus and their daughter Elizabeth Carus took on the editorial role after Carus&#x27; death.

<text>Bonnie Lynn Bernstein (born August 16, 1970) is an American sports journalist and media executive. She has been named one of the most accomplished female sportscasters in history by the American Sportscasters Association, spending nearly 20 years as a reporter and studio host at ESPN, ABC and CBS Sports, covering the NFL, NBA, MLB and college football and basketball. Bernstein is currently the founder and CEO of Walk Swiftly Productions, a multimedia production company specializing in non-scripted sports and entertainment content.

==Early life and education==
Bernstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Howell, New Jersey. She was salutatorian of her class at Howell High School, where she is a member of the school&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Bernstein was a four-time MVP of the Rebels gymnastics team, and also received varsity letters in indoor track and outdoor track and field, where she competed in hurdles, the 4x400 relay, javelin and shotput. Bernstein attended the University of Maryland, where she graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a degree in broadcast journalism. She was a four-time Academic All-America in gymnastics, receiving the Thomas M. Fields award for excellence in academics and athletics. Bernstein maintains close ties to her alma mater, and is on the Board of Visitors for the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland and the advisory board for the Povich Center for Sports Journalism.

==Career==
===Early years===
Bernstein spent three years climbing the local broadcast ladder, launching her career as the news and sports director at WXJN-FM radio in Lewes, Delaware. She transitioned to television at WMDT-TV in Salisbury, Maryland as the ABC affiliate&#x27;s weekend news anchor, then became Reno, Nevada&#x27;s, first-ever female weekday sports anchor at NBC affiliate KRNV-TV.

===ESPN===
Bernstein first joined ESPN in 1995 as its Chicago Bureau Chief, where she covered Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls&#x27; record-setting championship run (1996–98). She also was a correspondent for &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; and &quot;College GameDay&quot; and filed reports for &quot;SportsCenter&quot; during the Major League Baseball post-season and the NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship.

===CBS Sports===
Bernstein joined CBS Sports in 1998 as the lead sideline reporter for the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championships and feature reporter for &quot;The NFL Today&quot;. The following year, she transitioned to sideline reporting for the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot;. She worked with the Verne Lundquist/Dick Enberg and Dan Dierdorf crew until 2003, when she was promoted to the lead crew of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. Bernstein covered Super Bowls XXXV and XXXVIII for the network and during Super Bowl XXXVIII, became the first correspondent ever to cover the game for both network television and network radio, filing reports for CBS Sports and Westwood One Radio.

Upon signing with CBS/Westwood One Radio in 2001, Bernstein often pulled &quot;double duty&quot; during the NFL season, covering a Sunday game for CBS and &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; for radio.

In addition to her NFL and college basketball duties, Bernstein hosted the NCAA Women&#x27;s Gymnastics Championship and CBS&#x27; anthology series, &quot;Championships of the NCAA&quot;, and was a studio host for &quot;CBS SportsDesk&quot; and &quot;At The Half&quot;, CBS Sports&#x27; college basketball halftime studio show. Bernstein also covered tennis, track and field, horse racing and figure skating for the network and  hosted the U.S. Open Tennis Championships studio show and the Hambletonian.

===Return to ESPN===
In July 2006, Bernstein rejoined ESPN as the lead college football reporter for ESPN on ABC and the field reporter for &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan. On October 11, 2006, five days after experiencing severe leg pain while covering the Texas-Oklahoma Red River Rivalry, doctors discovered life-threatening blood clots in both of Bernstein&#x27;s lungs (pulmonary emboli) that originated in her left leg (deep vein thrombosis). She returned to ESPN and ABC several weeks later, but reduced her travel schedule the following season as a precautionary health measure, shifting focus to studio hosting many of ESPN&#x27;s high-profile shows, including &quot;NFL Live&quot;, &quot;Jim Rome Is Burning&quot;, &quot;Outside the Lines&quot;, &quot;First Take&quot; and &quot;College Football Live&quot;.

===Radio hosting===
In September 2009, Bernstein was named co-host of &quot;The Michael Kay Show&quot; on 1050 ESPN Radio in New York. She also covered the New York Jets and hosted specialty programming during the 2009–10 NFL playoffs. In July 2010, Bernstein was given her own daily NFL show, &quot;New York Football Live&quot;, co-hosted by Jets linebacker Greg Buttle.

===Campus Insiders===
In April 2013, Bernstein was named vice president of Content and Brand Development for Campus Insiders, a digital partnership between Silver Chalice Ventures, founded by Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and IMG College, the nation&#x27;s largest collegiate sports marketing company. Bernstein was also the on-air &quot;face&quot; of the network, hosting daily studio shows during the college football season and NCAA Basketball Championship. Her off-air responsibilities included creating original programming for the network, developing and securing new sponsor partnerships, and designing brand extensions that enhanced the reach of CI&#x27;s digital and social platforms.

===Walk Swiftly Productions===
In January 2017, Bernstein founded Walk Swiftly Productions, where she is CEO. Through WSP and her consultancy, Velvet Hammer Media, Bernstein collaborates with some of sports’ most prominent organizations, including the NCAA and the College Football Playoff (CFP). In 2019, ESPN&#x27;s docuseries, &quot;GOOD GAME: UC Irvine,&quot; produced by WSP and executive produced by Bernstein, received the Tempest Award for &quot;Best Esports-Themed Program;&quot;, and CMT&#x27;s &quot;Country on Campus&quot; received nominations for &quot;Best Music Series&quot; and &quot;Best Sports and Recreation&quot; series at the Cynopsis Short Form Video Awards&quot;.&quot; Other notable WSP titles include the XFL&#x27;s signature series, “For the Love of Football&quot; and the Audible Originals audio series, &quot;She Got Game.&quot;

===Other broadcast work===
Bernstein is the only female ever to solo fill-in host for the syndicated radio and TV program, &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; and appears as a guest commentator on several news networks, including NBC, MSNBC and FOX News Channel, to discuss prominent sports stories.

<text>Hookworm infection is an infection by a type of intestinal parasite known as a hookworm. Initially, itching and a rash may occur at the site of infection. Those only affected by a few worms may show no symptoms. Those infected by many worms may experience abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and tiredness. The mental and physical development of children may be affected. Anemia may result.
Two common hookworm infections in humans are ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis, caused by the species &quot;Ancylostoma duodenale&quot; and &quot;Necator americanus&quot; respectively. Hookworm eggs are deposited in the stools of infected people. If these end up in the environment, they can hatch into larvae (immature worms), which can then penetrate the skin. One type can also be spread through contaminated food. Risk factors include walking barefoot in warm climates, where sanitation is poor. Diagnosis is by examination of a stool sample with a microscope.
The risk of infection can be reduced on an individual level by not walking barefoot in areas where the disease is common. At a population level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using raw feces as fertilizer, and mass deworming are effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia.
Hookworms infected about 428 million people in 2015. Heavy infections can occur in both children and adults, but are less common in adults. They are rarely fatal. Hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis and classified as a neglected tropical disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
No symptoms or signs are specific to hookworm infection, but they give rise to a combination of intestinal inflammation and progressive iron-deficiency anemia and protein deficiency. Coughing, chest pain, wheezing, and fever sometimes result from severe infection. Epigastric pains, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea can occur early or in later stages, as well, although gastrointestinal symptoms tend to improve with time. Signs of advanced severe infection are those of anemia and protein deficiency, including emaciation, cardiac failure, and abdominal distension with ascites.

Larval invasion of the skin (mostly in the Americas) can produce a skin disease called cutaneous larva migrans also known as creeping eruption. The hosts of these worms are not human and the larvae can only penetrate the upper five layers of the skin, where they give rise to intense, local itching, usually on the foot or lower leg, known as ground itch. This infection is due to larvae from the &quot;A. braziliense&quot; hookworm. The larvae migrate in tortuous tunnels between the stratum basale and stratum corneum of the skin, causing serpiginous vesicular lesions. With the advancing movement of the larvae, the rear portions of the lesions become dry and crusty. The lesions are typically intensely itchy.

===Incubation period===
The incubation period can vary between a few weeks to many months and is largely dependent on the number of hookworm parasites an individual is infected with.

==Cause==

Hookworm infections in humans include ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis. Ancylostomiasis is caused by &quot;Ancylostoma duodenale,&quot; which is the more common type found in the Middle East, North Africa, India, and (formerly) in southern Europe. Necatoriasis is caused by &quot;Necator americanus,&quot; the more common type in the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and Indonesia.

Other animals such as birds, dogs, and cats may also be affected. &quot;A. tubaeforme&quot; infects cats, &quot;A. caninum&quot; infects dogs, and &quot;A. braziliense&quot; and &quot;Uncinaria stenocephala&quot; infect both cats and dogs. Some of these infections can be transmitted to humans.

===Morphology===
&quot;A. duodenale&quot; worms are grayish-white or pinkish with the head slightly bent in relation to the rest of the body. This bend forms a definitive hook shape at the anterior end for which hookworms are named. They possess well-developed mouths with two pairs of teeth. While males measure approximately one centimeter by 0.5 millimeter, the females are often longer and stouter. Additionally, males can be distinguished from females based on the presence of a prominent posterior copulatory bursa.

&quot;N. americanus&quot; is very similar in morphology to &quot;A. duodenale&quot;. &quot;N. americanus&quot; is generally smaller than &quot;A. duodenale&quot; with males usually 5 to 9 mm long and females about 1 cm long. Whereas &quot;A. duodenale&quot; possesses two pairs of teeth, &quot;N. americanus&quot; possesses a pair of cutting plates in the buccal capsule. Additionally, the hook shape is much more defined in &quot;Necator&quot; than in &quot;Ancylostoma&quot;.

===Life cycle===

The hookworm thrives in warm soil where temperatures are over . They exist primarily in sandy or loamy soil and cannot live in clay or muck. Rainfall averages must be more than a year for them to survive. Only if these conditions exist can the eggs hatch. Infective larvae of &quot;N. americanus&quot; can survive at higher temperatures, whereas those of &quot;A. duodenale&quot; are better adapted to cooler climates. Generally, they live for only a few weeks at most under natural conditions and die almost immediately on exposure to direct sunlight or desiccation.

Infection of the host is by the larvae, not the eggs. While &quot;A. duodenale&quot; can be ingested, the usual method of infection is through the skin; this is commonly caused by walking barefoot through areas contaminated with fecal matter. The larvae can penetrate the skin of the foot, and once inside the body, they migrate through the vascular system to the lungs, and from there up the trachea, and are swallowed. They then pass down the esophagus and enter the digestive system, finishing their journey in the intestine, where the larvae mature into adult worms.

Once in the host gut, &quot;Necator&quot; tends to cause a prolonged infection, generally 1 to 5 years (many worms die within a year or two of infection), though some adult worms have been recorded to live for 15 years or more. &quot;Ancylostoma&quot; adults are short-lived, surviving on average for only about 6 months. However, the infection can be prolonged because dormant larvae can be &quot;recruited&quot; sequentially from tissue &quot;stores&quot; over many years, to replace expired adult worms. This can give rise to seasonal fluctuations in infection prevalence and intensity (apart from normal seasonal variations in transmission).

They mate inside the host, females laying from 10,000 to 30,000 eggs per day and some 15 to 56 million eggs during their adult lifetimes, which pass out in feces. Because 5 to 7 weeks are needed for adult worms to mature, mate, and produce eggs, in the early stages of very heavy infection, acute symptoms might occur without any eggs being detected in the patient&#x27;s feces. This can make diagnosis very difficult.

&quot;N. americanus&quot; and &quot;A. duodenale&quot; eggs can be found in warm, moist soil where they eventually hatch into first-stage larvae, or L1. L1, the feeding noninfective rhabditoform stage, will feed on soil microbes and eventually molt into second-stage larvae, L2, which is also in the rhabditoform stage. It will feed for about 7 days and then molt into the third-stage larvae, or L3. This is the filariform stage of the parasite, that is, the nonfeeding infective form of the larvae. The L3 larvae are extremely motile and seek higher ground to increase their chances of penetrating the skin of a human host. The L3 larvae can survive up to 2 weeks without finding a host. While &quot;N. americanus&quot; larvae only infect through penetration of the skin, &quot;A. duodenale&quot; can infect both through penetration and orally. After the L3 larvae have successfully entered the host, they then travel through the subcutaneous venules and lymphatic vessels of the human host. Eventually, the L3 larvae enter the lungs through the pulmonary capillaries and break out into the alveoli. They then travel up the trachea to be coughed and swallowed by the host. After being swallowed, the L3 larvae are then found in the small intestine, where they molt into the L4, or adult worm stage. The entire process from skin penetration to adult development takes about 5–9 weeks. The female adult worms release eggs (&quot;N. americanus&quot; about 9,000–10,000 eggs/day and &quot;A. duodenale&quot; 25,000–30,000 eggs/day), which are passed in the feces of the human host. These eggs hatch in the environment within several days and the cycle starts anew.

==Pathophysiology==
Hookworm infection is generally considered to be asymptomatic, but as Norman Stoll described in 1962, it is an extremely dangerous infection because its damage is &quot;silent and insidious.&quot; An individual may experience general symptoms soon after infection. Ground-itch, which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry, is common in patients infected with &quot;N. americanus&quot;. Additionally, cough and pneumonitis may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea. Then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature, the infected individual will experience diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the &quot;silent and insidious&quot; symptoms referred to by Stoll are related to chronic, heavy-intensity hookworm infections. Major morbidity associated with hookworm infection is caused by intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and protein malnutrition. They result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood, rupturing erythrocytes, and degrading hemoglobin in the host. This long-term blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema; eosinophilia and pica/geophagy caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworm-infected patients. Recently, more attention has been given to other important outcomes of hookworm infection that play a large role in public health. It is now widely accepted that children who have chronic hookworm infection can experience growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments. Additionally, recent research has focused on the potential of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes when the mother is infected with hookworm during pregnancy.

The disease was linked to nematode worms (&quot;Ankylostoma duodenalis&quot;) from one-third to half an inch long in the intestine chiefly through the labours of Theodor Bilharz and Griesinger in Egypt (1854).

The symptoms can be linked to inflammation in the gut stimulated by feeding hookworms, such as nausea, abdominal pain and intermittent diarrhea, and to progressive anemia in prolonged disease: appetite, pica/geophagy (or dirt-eating), obstinate constipation followed by diarrhea, palpitations, thready pulse, coldness of the skin, pallor of the mucous membranes, fatigue and weakness, shortness of breath and in cases running a fatal course, dysentery, hemorrhages and edema. The worms suck blood and damage the mucosa. However, the blood loss in the stools is not visibly apparent.

Blood tests in early infection often show a rise in numbers of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that is preferentially stimulated by worm infections in tissues (large numbers of eosinophils are also present in the local inflammatory response). Falling blood hemoglobin levels will be seen in cases of prolonged infection with anemia.

In contrast to most intestinal helminthiases, where the heaviest parasitic loads tend to occur in children, hookworm prevalence and intensity can be higher among adult males. The explanation for this is that hookworm infection tends to be occupational so that coworkers and other close groups maintain a high prevalence of infection among themselves by contaminating their work environment. However, in most endemic areas, adult women are the most severely affected by anemia, mainly because they have much higher physiological needs for iron (menstruation, repeated pregnancy). An interesting consequence of this in the case of &quot;Ancylostoma duodenale&quot; infection is translactational transmission of infection: the skin-invasive larvae of this species do not all immediately pass through the lungs and on into the gut, but spread around the body via the circulation, to become dormant inside muscle fibers. In a pregnant woman, after childbirth some or all of these larvae are stimulated to re-enter the circulation (presumably by sudden hormonal changes), then to pass into the mammary glands, so that the newborn baby can receive a large dose of infective larvae through its mother&#x27;s milk. This accounts for otherwise inexplicable cases of very heavy, even fatal, hookworm infections in children a month or so of age, in places such as China, India, and northern Australia.
An identical phenomenon is much more commonly seen with &quot;Ancylostoma caninum&quot; infections in dogs, where the newborn pups can even die of hemorrhaging from their intestines caused by massive numbers of feeding hookworms. This also reflects the close evolutionary link between the human and canine parasites, which probably have a common ancestor dating back to when humans and dogs first started living closely together.
Filariform larvae are the infective stage of the parasite: infection occurs when larvae in soil penetrate the skin, or when they are ingested through contaminated food and water following skin penetration.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis depends on finding characteristic worm eggs on microscopic examination of the stools, although this is not possible in early infection. Early signs of infection in most dogs include limbular limping and anal itching. The eggs are oval or elliptical, measuring 60 by 40 μm, colorless, not bile stained, and with a thin transparent hyaline shell membrane. When released by the worm in the intestine, the egg contains an unsegmented ovum. During its passage down the intestine, the ovum develops and thus the eggs passed in feces have a segmented ovum, usually with 4 to 8 blastomeres.
As the eggs of both &quot;Ancylostoma&quot; and &quot;Necator&quot; (and most other hookworm species) are indistinguishable, to identify the genus, they must be cultured in the lab to allow larvae to hatch out. If the fecal sample is left for a day or more under tropical conditions, the larvae will have hatched out, so eggs might no longer be evident. In such a case, it is essential to distinguish hookworms from &quot;Strongyloides&quot; larvae, as infection with the latter has more serious implications and requires different management. The larvae of the two hookworm species can also be distinguished microscopically, although this would not be done routinely, but usually for research purposes. Adult worms are rarely seen (except via endoscopy, surgery or autopsy), but if found, would allow definitive identification of the species. Classification can be performed based on the length of the buccal cavity, the space between the oral opening and the esophagus: hookworm rhabditoform larvae have long buccal cavities whereas &quot;Strongyloides&quot; rhabditoform larvae have short buccal cavities.

Recent research has focused on the development of DNA-based tools for diagnosis of infection, specific identification of hookworm, and analysis of genetic variability within hookworm populations. Because hookworm eggs are often indistinguishable from other parasitic eggs, PCR assays could serve as a molecular approach for accurate diagnosis of hookworm in the feces.

==Prevention==

The infective larvae develop and survive in an environment of damp dirt, particularly sandy and loamy soil. They cannot survive in clay or muck. The main lines of precaution are those dictated by good hygiene behaviors:
* Do not defecate in the open, but rather in toilets.
* Do not use untreated human excreta or raw sewage as fertilizer in agriculture.
* Do not walk barefoot in known infected areas.
* Deworm pet dogs and cats. Canine and feline hookworms rarely develop to adulthood in humans. &quot;Ancylostoma caninum&quot;, the common dog hookworm, occasionally develops into an adult to cause eosinophilic enteritis in people, but their invasive larvae can cause an itchy rash called cutaneous larva migrans.

Moxidectin is available in the United States as (imidacloprid + moxidectin) topical solution for dogs and cats. It utilizes moxidectin for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms.
=== Children ===
Most of these public health concerns have focused on children who are infected with hookworm. This focus on children is largely due to the large body of evidence that has demonstrated strong associations between hookworm infection and impaired learning, increased absences from school, and decreased future economic productivity. In 2001, the 54th World Health Assembly passed a resolution demanding member states to attain a minimum target of regular deworming of at least 75% of all at-risk school children by the year 2010. A 2008 World Health Organization publication reported on these efforts to treat at-risk school children. Some of the interesting statistics were as follows: 1) only 9 out of 130 endemic countries were able to reach the 75% target goal; and 2) less than 77 million school-aged children (of the total 878 million at risk) were reached, which means that only 8.78% of at-risk children are being treated for hookworm infection.

=== School-based mass deworming ===
School-based mass deworming programs have been the most popular strategy to address the issue of hookworm infection in children. School-based programs are extremely cost-effective as schools already have an available, extensive, and sustained infrastructure with a skilled workforce that has a close relationship with the community. With little training from a local health system, teachers can easily administer the drugs which often cost less than US$0.50 per child per year.

Recently, many people have questioned if the school-based programs are necessarily the most effective approach. An important concern with school-based programs is that they often do not reach children who do not attend school, thus ignoring a large number of at-risk children. A 2008 study by Massa &quot;et al.&quot; continued the debate regarding school-based programs. They examined the effects of community-directed treatments versus school-based treatments in the Tanga Region of Tanzania. A major conclusion was that the mean infection intensity of hookworm was significantly lower in the villages employing the community-directed treatment approach than the school-based approach. The community-directed treatment model used in this specific study allowed villagers to take control of the child&#x27;s treatment by having villagers select their own community drug distributors to administer the antihelminthic drugs. Additionally, villagers organized and implemented their own methods for distributing the drugs to all children. The positive results associated with this new model highlight the need for large-scale community involvement in deworming campaigns.

=== Public health education ===
Many mass deworming programs also combine their efforts with public health education. These health education programs often stress important preventative techniques such as: washing your hands before eating and staying away from water/areas contaminated by human feces. These programs may also stress that shoes must be worn, however, these come with their own health risks and may not be effective. Shoe wearing patterns in towns and villages across the globe are determined by cultural beliefs, and the levels of education within that society. The wearing of shoes will prevent the entry of hookworm infections from the surrounding soils into tender skin regions; such as areas between the toes.

=== Sanitation ===
Historical examples, such as the hookworm campaigns in Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 have shown that the primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk children do not have access to clean water to wash their hands and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure. Health education, therefore, must address preventive measures in ways that are both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.

=== Integrated approaches ===
Evaluation of numerous public health interventions has generally shown that improvement in each individual component ordinarily attributed to poverty (for example, sanitation, health education, and underlying nutrition status) often has minimal impact on transmission. For example, one study found that the introduction of latrines into a resource-limited community only reduced the prevalence of hookworm infection by four percent. However, another study in Salvador, Brazil found that improved drainage and sewerage had a significant impact on the prevalence of hookworm infection but no impact at all on the intensity of hookworm infection. This seems to suggest that environmental control alone has a limited but incomplete effect on the transmission of hookworms. It is imperative, therefore, that more research is performed to understand the efficacy and sustainability of integrated programs that combine numerous preventive methods including education, sanitation, and treatment.

==Treatment==
=== Anthelmintic drugs ===
The most common treatments for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode&#x27;s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review found that the efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also has anemia that ferrous sulfate (200 mg) be administered three times daily at the same time as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.

Hookworm infection can be treated with local cryotherapy when the hookworm is still in the skin.

Albendazole is effective both in the intestinal stage and during the stage the parasite is still migrating under the skin.

In the case of anemia, iron supplementation can cause relief symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia. However, as red blood cell levels are restored, a shortage of other essentials such as folic acid or vitamin B12 may develop, so these might also be supplemented.

During the 1910s, common treatments for hookworm included thymol, 2-naphthol, chloroform, gasoline, and eucalyptus oil. By the 1940s, the treatment of choice used tetrachloroethylene, given as 3 to 4 cc in the fasting state, followed by 30 to 45 g of sodium sulfate. Tetrachloroethylene was reported to have a cure rate of 80 percent for Necator infections, but 25 percent in Ancylostoma infections, and often produced mild intoxication in the patient.

=== Reinfection and drug resistance ===
Other important issues related to the treatment of hookworm are reinfection and drug resistance. It has been shown that reinfection after treatment can be extremely high. Some studies even show that 80% of pretreatment hookworm infection rates can be seen in treated communities within 30–36 months. While reinfection may occur, it is still recommended that regular treatments be conducted as it will minimize the occurrence of chronic outcomes. There are also increasing concerns about the issue of drug resistance. Drug resistance has appeared in front-line anthelmintics used for livestock nematodes. Generally, human nematodes are less likely to develop resistance due to longer reproducing times, less frequent treatment, and more targeted treatment. Nonetheless, the global community must be careful to maintain the effectiveness of current anthelmintic as no new anthelmintic drugs are in the late-stage development.

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that between 576 and 740 million individuals are infected with hookworm. Of these infected individuals, about 80 million are severely affected. The major cause of hookworm infection is &quot;N. americanus&quot; which is found in the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. &quot;A. duodenale&quot; is found in more scattered focal environments, namely Europe and the Mediterranean. Most infected individuals are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia/the Pacific Islands with each region having estimates of 198 million and 149 million infected individuals, respectively. Other affected regions include: South Asia (50 million), Latin America and the Caribbean (50 million), South Asia (59 million), and Middle East/North Africa (10 million). A majority of these infected individuals live in poverty-stricken areas with poor sanitation. Hookworm infection is most concentrated among the world&#x27;s poorest who live on less than $2 a day.

While hookworm infection may not directly lead to mortality, its effects on morbidity demand immediate attention. When considering disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), neglected tropical diseases, including hookworm infection, rank among diarrheal diseases, ischemic heart disease, malaria, and tuberculosis as one of the most important health problems of the developing world.

It has been estimated that as many as 22.1 million DALYs have been lost due to hookworm infection. Recently, there has been increasing interest to address the public health concerns associated with hookworm infection. For example, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation recently donated US$34 million to fight Neglected Tropical Diseases including hookworm infection. Former US President Clinton also announced a mega-commitment at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) 2008 Annual Meeting to de-worm 10 million children.

Many of the numbers regarding the prevalence of hookworm infection are estimates as there is no international surveillance mechanism currently in place to determine prevalence and global distribution. Some prevalence rates have been measured through survey data in endemic regions around the world. The following are some of the most recent findings on prevalence rates in regions endemic with hookworm.

Darjeeling, Hooghly District, West Bengal, India (Pal &quot;et al.&quot; 2007)
* 43% infection rate of predominantly &quot;N. americanus&quot; although with some &quot;A. duodenale&quot; infection
* Both hookworm infection load and degree of anemia in the mild range

Xiulongkan Village, Hainan Province, China (Gandhi &quot;et al.&quot; 2001)
* 60% infection rate of predominantly &quot;N. americanus&quot;
* Important trends noted were that prevalence increased with age (plateau of about 41 years) and women had higher prevalence rates than men

Hòa Bình, Northwest Vietnam (Verle &quot;et al.&quot; 2003)
* 52% of a total of 526 tested households infected
* Could not identify species, but previous studies in North Vietnam reported &quot;N. americanus&quot; in more than 95% of hookworm larvae

Minas Gerais, Brazil (Fleming &quot;et al.&quot; 2006)
* 63% infection rate of predominantly &quot;N. americanus&quot;

KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Mabaso &quot;et al.&quot; 2004)
* Inland areas had a prevalence rate of 9% of &quot;N. americanus&quot;
* Coastal plain areas had a prevalence rate of 63% of &quot;N. americanus&quot;

Lowndes County, Alabama, United States 
* 35% infection rate of predominantly &quot;N. americanus&quot;

There have also been technological developments that may facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence. Some researchers have begun to use geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology. Brooker &quot;et al.&quot; utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of sub-Saharan Africa. By relating satellite-derived environmental data with prevalence data from school-based surveys, they were able to create detailed prevalence maps. The study focused on a wide range of helminths, but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found. As compared to other helminths, hookworms can survive in much hotter conditions and were highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range.

Improved molecular diagnostic tools are another technological advancement that could help improve existing prevalence statistics. Recent research has focused on the development of a DNA-based tool that can be used for diagnosis of infection, specific identification of hookworm, and analysis of genetic variability in hookworm populations. Again this can serve as a major tool for different public health measures against hookworm infection. Most research regarding diagnostic tools is now focused on the creation of a rapid and cost-effective assay for the specific diagnosis of hookworm infection. Many are hopeful that its development can be achieved within the next five years.

==History==
===Discovery===
The symptoms now attributed to hookworm appear in papyrus papers of ancient Egypt (), described as a derangement characterized by anemia. Avicenna, a Persian physician of the eleventh century, discovered the worm in several of his patients and related it to their disease. In later times, the condition was noticeably prevalent in the mining industry in England, France, Germany, Belgium, North Queensland, and elsewhere.

Italian physician Angelo Dubini was the modern-day discoverer of the worm in 1838 after an autopsy of a peasant woman. Dubini published details in 1843 and identified the species as &quot;A. duodenale&quot;. Working in the Egyptian medical system in 1852 German physician Theodor Bilharz, drawing upon the work of colleague Wilhelm Griesinger, found these worms during autopsies and went a step further in linking them to local endemic occurrences of chlorosis, which would probably be called iron-deficiency anemia today.

A breakthrough came 25 years later following a diarrhea and anemia epidemic that took place among Italian workmen employed on the Gotthard Rail Tunnel. In an 1880 paper, physicians Camillo Bozzolo, Edoardo Perroncito, and Luigi Pagliani correctly hypothesized that hookworm was linked to the fact that workers had to defecate inside the 15 km tunnel, and that many wore worn-out shoes. The work environment often contained standing water, sometimes knee-deep, and the larvae were capable of surviving several weeks in the water, allowing them to infect many of the workers. In 1897, it was established that the skin was the principal avenue of infection and the biological life cycle of the hookworm was clarified.

===Eradication programmes===
In 1899, American zoologist Charles Wardell Stiles identified progressive pernicious anemia seen in the southern United States as being caused by the hookworm &quot;A. duodenale&quot;. Testing in the 1900s revealed very heavy infestations in school-age children. In Puerto Rico, Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, a US Army physician, organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign, which cured approximately 300,000 people (one-third of the Puerto Rican population) and reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent during the years 1903–04.
On October 26, 1909, the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease was organized as a result of a gift of US$1 million from John D. Rockefeller, Sr. The five-year program was a remarkable success and a great contribution to the United States&#x27; public health, instilling public education, medication, field work and modern government health departments in eleven southern states.
The hookworm exhibit was a prominent part of the 1910 Mississippi State Fair.

The commission found that an average of 40% of school-aged children were infected with hookworm. Areas with higher levels of hookworm infection prior to the eradication program experienced greater increases in school enrollment, attendance, and literacy after the intervention. Econometric studies have shown that this effect cannot be explained by a variety of alternative factors, including differential trends across areas, changing crop prices, shifts in certain educational and health policies, and the effect of malaria eradication. No significant contemporaneous results were found for adults who should have benefited less from the intervention owing to their substantially lower (prior) infection rates. The program nearly eradicated hookworm and would flourish afterward with new funding as the Rockefeller Foundation International Health Division.

The RF&#x27;s hookworm campaign in Mexico showed how science and politics play a role in developing health policies. It brought together government officials, health officials, public health workers, Rockefeller officials, and the community. This campaign was launched to eradicate hookworms in Mexico. Although the campaign did not focus on long-term treatments, it did set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation. The scientific knowledge behind this campaign helped shape public health policies, improved public health and built a strong relationship between US and Mexico.

In the 1920s, hookworm eradication reached the Caribbean and Latin America, where great mortality was reported among people in the West Indies towards the end of the 18th century, as well as through descriptions sent from Brazil and various other tropical and subtropical regions.

===Treatments===
Treatment in the early 20th century relied on the use of Epsom salt to reduce protective mucus, followed by thymol to kill the worms. By the 1940s, tetrachloroethylene was the leading method. It was not until later in the mid-20th century when new organic drug compounds were developed.

==Research==
===Anemia in pregnancy===
It is estimated that a third of all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries experience anemia, and 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.

This lack of deworming of pregnant women is explained by the fact that most individuals still fear that anthelmintic treatment will result in adverse birth outcomes. However, a 2006 study by Gyorkos et al. found that when comparing a group of pregnant women treated with mebendazole with a control placebo group, both illustrated rather similar rates of adverse birth outcomes. The treated group demonstrated 5.6% adverse birth outcomes, while the control group had 6.25% adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, Larocque et al. illustrated that treatment for hookworm infection actually led to positive health results in the infant. This study concluded that treatment with mebendazole plus iron supplements during antenatal care significantly reduced the proportion of very low birth weight infants when compared to a placebo control group. Studies so far have validated recommendations to treat infected pregnant women for hookworm infection during pregnancy.

A review found that a single dose of antihelminthics (anti-worm drugs) given in the second trimester of pregnancy &quot;may reduce maternal anaemia and worm prevalence when used in settings with a high prevalence of maternal helminthiasis&quot;.

===Malaria co-infection===
Co-infection with hookworm and &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; is common in Africa. Although exact numbers are unknown, preliminary analyses estimate that as many as a quarter of African schoolchildren (17.8–32.1 million children aged 5–14 years) may be coincidentally at-risk of both &quot;P. falciparum&quot; and hookworm. While original hypotheses stated that co-infection with multiple parasites would impair the host&#x27;s immune response to a single parasite and increase susceptibility to clinical disease, studies have yielded contrasting results. For example, one study in Senegal showed that the risk of clinical malaria infection was increased in helminth-infected children in comparison to helminth-free children while other studies have failed to reproduce such results, and even among laboratory mouse experiments the effect of helminths on malaria is variable.

Some hypotheses and studies suggest that helminth infections may protect against cerebral malaria due to the possible modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying this supposed increased susceptibility to disease are unknown. For example, helminth infections cause potent and highly polarized immune response characterized by increased T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. However, the effect of such responses on the human immune response is unknown. Additionally, both malaria and helminth infection can cause anemia, but the effect of co-infection and possible enhancement of anemia is poorly understood.

===Hygiene hypothesis and hookworm as therapy===

The hygiene hypothesis states that infants and children who lack exposure to infectious agents are more susceptible to allergic diseases via modulation of immune system development. The theory was first proposed by David P. Strachan who noted that hay fever and eczema were less common in children who belonged to large families. Since then, studies have noted the effect of gastrointestinal worms on the development of allergies in the developing world. For example, a study in Gambia found that the eradication of worms in some villages led to increased skin reactions to allergies among children.

===Vaccines===

While annual or semi-annual mass antihelminthic administration is a critical aspect of any public health intervention, many have begun to realize how unsustainable it is due to aspects such as poverty, high rates of re-infection, and diminished efficacy of drugs with repeated use. Current research, therefore, has focused on the development of a vaccine that could be integrated into existing control programs. The goal of vaccine development is not necessarily to create a vaccine with sterilizing immunity or complete protection against immunity. A vaccine that reduces the likelihood of vaccinated individuals developing severe infections and thus reduced blood and nutrient levels could still have a significant impact on the high burden of disease throughout the world.

Current research focuses on targeting two stages in the development of the worm: the larval stage and the adult stage. Research on larval antigens has focused on proteins that are members of the pathogenesis-related protein superfamily, &quot;Ancylostoma&quot; Secreted Proteins. Although they were first described in &quot;Anyclostoma&quot;, these proteins have also been successfully isolated from the secreted product of &quot;N. americanus&quot;. &quot;N. americanus&quot; ASP-2 (Na-ASP-2) is currently the leading larval-stage hookworm vaccine candidate. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has already been performed; 36 healthy adults without a history of hookworm infection were given three intramuscular injections of three different concentrations of Na-ASP-2 and observed for six months after the final vaccination. The vaccine induced significant anti-Na-ASP-2 IgG and cellular immune responses. In addition, it was safe and produced no debilitating side effects. The vaccine is now in a phase one trial; healthy adult volunteers with documented evidence of previous infection in Brazil are being given the same dose concentration on the same schedule used in the initial study. If this study is successful, the next step would be to conduct a phase two trial to assess the rate and intensity of hookworm infection among vaccinated persons. Because the Na-ASP-2 vaccine only targets the larval stage, it is critical that all subjects enrolled in the study be treated with antihelminthic drugs to eliminate adult worms prior to vaccination.

Adult hookworm antigens have also been identified as potential candidates for vaccines. When adult worms attach to the intestinal mucosa of the human host, erythrocytes are ruptured in the worm&#x27;s digestive tract which causes the release of free hemoglobin which is subsequently degraded by a proteolytic cascade. Several of these proteins that are responsible for this proteolytic cascade are also essential for the worm&#x27;s nutrition and survival. Therefore, a vaccine that could induce antibodies for these antigens could interfere with the hookworm&#x27;s digestive pathway and impair the worm&#x27;s survival. Three proteins have been identified: the aspartic protease-hemoglobinase APR-1, the cysteine protease-hemoglobinase CP-2, and a glutathione S-transferase. Vaccination with APR-1 and CP-2 led to reduced host blood loss and fecal egg counts in dogs. With APR-1, vaccination even led to reduced worm burden. Research is currently stymied at the development of at least one of these antigens as a recombinant protein for testing in clinical trials.

<text>Francis Harold Scarfe (1911–1986) was an English poet, critic and novelist, who became an academic, translator and Director of the British Institute in Paris.

He was born in South Shields; he was brought up from a young age at the Royal Merchant Seaman&#x27;s Orphanage. He was educated at Armstrong College in Newcastle, which was then part of Durham University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1933. He also studied at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge and at the Sorbonne.

While in Paris he wrote surrealist verse, and dabbled in communism, from which he then retreated. He taught at the University of Glasgow briefly before the outbreak of World War II, in which he worked in the British Army&#x27;s Education Corps. He was posted to Orkney, and the Faroe Islands. While in Orkney he lodged with the family of the young George Mackay Brown, on whom he was a major influence.

His book from 1942 was one of the first to engage critically with the Auden Group, if superficially; he returned to Auden in a post-war book of greater depth. After the war he held a number of academic positions.

<text>Benjamin Michael Lee (born 11 September 1978) is an Australian musician and actor. Lee began his career as a musician at the age of 14 with the Sydney band Noise Addict, but he focused on his solo career when the band broke up in 1995. He appeared as the protagonist in the Australian film &quot;The Rage in Placid Lake&quot; (2003). He has released eleven solo studio albums.

==Career==
===Noise Addict===
Lee&#x27;s musical career began in 1993 with the band Noise Addict, who were signed to Steve Pavlovic&#x27;s independent label Fellaheen Records, on the strength of a self-produced and distributed four-track demo recorded in Lee&#x27;s bedroom. Pavlovic&#x27;s connections brought the band to the attention of Sonic Youth&#x27;s Thurston Moore and Beastie Boys&#x27; Mike D, both of whom released the band&#x27;s material in the US.

The group put out several releases on the Beasties&#x27; Grand Royal Records. These included the acoustic &quot;Young and Jaded&quot; EP in 1994, which contained Lee&#x27;s tribute to Evan Dando, &quot;I Wish I Was Him&quot;. In 1995, Grand Royal released the band&#x27;s only full-length album, the Brad Wood–produced &quot;Meet the Real You&quot;. Noise Addict made a music video for the song &quot;16&quot;, toured with Sebadoh, but then broke up. Lee was also briefly a member of the alternative act Gerling.

In 2009, Lee recorded a new Noise Addict album, &quot;It Was Never About the Audience&quot;, with a new lineup: Lou Barlow and Lara Meyerratken.

===Solo career===
Lee&#x27;s solo career started at the age of 16, while he was still in Noise Addict. He began recording his first solo album, &quot;Grandpaw Would&quot;, in both Sydney and Chicago with producer Brad Wood. This was followed by the 1997 album, &quot;Something to Remember Me By&quot;, also produced by Wood. An alternate version of his song &quot;Burn to Shine&quot;, produced by T-Bone Burnett, played over the end credits of the film &quot;Best Men&quot;. Lee was then featured on the &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; soundtrack, with the song &quot;How to Survive a Broken Heart&quot;. 1998&#x27;s &quot;Breathing Tornados&quot;, released on Pavlovic&#x27;s new label Modular, marked a new direction for Lee as he introduced synthesisers and increased instrumentation into his sound.

The album was a success in Australia, earning Lee ARIA Award nominations for Best Male Artist and Album of the Year. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Cigarettes Will Kill You&quot;, was also nominated for Single of the Year and finished second in that year&#x27;s Triple J Hottest 100. In 2001, Lee contributed a track (&quot;Sweet Is the Night&quot;) to a Jeff Lynne tribute album &quot;Lynne Me Your Ears&quot;.

Lee&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;hey you. yes you.&quot;, was released in 2002. The first single from the album, &quot;Something Borrowed, Something Blue&quot;, reached number 67 on the ARIA Charts and number 22 on the 2002&#x27;s Triple J Hottest 100. The second single, &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;, peaked at number 82 on the ARIA charts. In 2003, he also contributed several songs to the Evan Dando solo album &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Bored&quot;.

In late 2004, Lee left Steve Pavlovic&#x27;s Modular Recordings and started his own record label, Ten Fingers. The first release on the label was the single, &quot;Gamble Everything for Love&quot;, followed by the album, &quot;Awake Is the New Sleep&quot; in February 2005, which went double platinum in Australia. A defining release in his career, the album showcased a much brighter, positive side of Lee&#x27;s personality, in contrast to his previous darker musings. &quot;Awake Is the New Sleep&quot; received several nominations for the 2005 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) awards, and Lee won Best Male Artist, Best Independent Release, and Single of the Year for &quot;Catch My Disease&quot;, which Lee wrote with Mcgowan Southworth. &quot;Catch My Disease&quot; also went to No. 2 on the 2005 Triple J Hottest 100.

In addition, the song was featured on the soundtracks to the 2005 films &quot;Just Friends&quot; and &quot;Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo&quot; as well as the soundtracks to the television series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Hidden Palms&quot; and &quot;Scrubs&quot;. In 2006, it was used in a television commercial for Dell Computers. On 26 March 2006, Lee performed &quot;We&#x27;re All in This Together&quot; from &quot;Awake Is the New Sleep&quot; at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The single for &quot;We&#x27;re All in This Together&quot; was released on 8 April 2006. The CD includes cover versions of the song by Pony Up, Holidays on Ice and Gelbison. &quot;We&#x27;re All in This Together&quot; has been used in commercials for Kohl&#x27;s (2008), Coca-Cola (Remixed Australian Summer Series Ads in 2007), the South Australian Government (2006), the Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal (2007), and Telus Mobility&#x27;s &quot;My Faves&quot; (2007).

Lee released his sixth album, &quot;Ripe&quot;, on 18 September 2007, with Benji Madden and Mandy Moore making appearances. Mandy Moore sang a light-hearted, 1950s-style duet with Lee called &quot;Birds and Bees&quot;. &quot;Mandy was very sweet and did her best Olivia Newton-John for me. I&#x27;m really psyched about this recording,&quot; Lee says. Madden helped out with some backing vocals, along with US band Rooney and Sara Watkins from the band Nickel Creek. &quot;American Television&quot; from the album was used in a VH1 advertisement for &quot;Flavor of Love 3&quot; and the song &quot;Ripe&quot; appeared in an episode of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; (Season 5, episode 2).

In 2007, Lee performed a cover of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&#x27;s &quot;Our House&quot; for Landmarks on The DL.

In February 2009, Lee released his seventh studio album, &quot;The Rebirth of Venus&quot;, which received mixed reviews. It featured guest performances from the likes of Missy Higgins and Patience Hodgson, and peaked at No.21 on the ARIA Charts.

Lee&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Deeper into Dream&quot;, was released on 11 October 2011. It was Lee&#x27;s first attempt at a concept album, basing the entire 12 tracks around the dream state. Despite not charting, it was received fairly favourably by critics.

In April 2013, Lee released his ninth and arguably his most experimental studio album, entitled &quot;&quot;, with collaboration from Jessica Chapnik. The album is based upon his personal experience with the psychoactive South American drug known as Ayahuasca. Lee featured as the mentor for Joel Madden&#x27;s team on the 2013 season of &quot;The Voice Australia&quot;.

In June 2015, Lee released his 10th solo album, &quot;Love Is the Great Rebellion&quot;, his first on a major label, Warner Bros. Records.

According to Radio National&#x27;s Geoff Wood, Lee invented the term &quot;electro-yoga&quot; to describe a new form of music dedicated to the practice of yoga. Lee has since followed up this release with an acoustically oriented album, entitled &quot;Freedom, Love and The Recuperation of the Human Mind&quot;, in 2016, as well as a children&#x27;s album called &quot;Ben Lee Sings Songs About Islam for the Whole Family&quot; in 2017. Together with former &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; star Josh Radnor, Lee formed an indie-folk duo called Radnor and Lee, and they released their debut self-titled album in November 2017.

2018 saw the release of &quot;B Is for Beer&quot;, a soundtrack to the musical based on the novel of the same name written by Tom Robbins. Lee and Robbins had collaborated for ten years to develop the musical. Funding for the album&#x27;s development came via crowd-sourcing at Kickstarter.

<text>Four ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;Coromandel&quot;, after the Coromandel Coast of India:

* was a 56-gun fourth rate, previously the East Indiaman &quot;Winterton&quot;. She was purchased on the stocks in 1795, used as a storeship from 1800, was converted to a convalescent ship in 1807 for Jamaica, and was sold there in 1813. She returned to Britain around 1847 and was wrecked at Yarmouth in 1856.
* HMS &quot;Coromandel&quot; was the East Indiaman &quot;Cuvera&quot;, which the Admiralty bought in 1804 and converted to the 56-gun fourth-rate . She was rebuilt as a 20-gun storeship in 1806 and renamed HMS &quot;Coromandel&quot; in 1815. She transported convicts to Australia in 1819. From 1828 to 1853, when she was broken up, she served as a prison hulk in Bermuda.
* was a wooden paddle dispatch vessel of the Royal Navy. She was built in 1853 for the P&amp;O company as the passenger and cargo steamer &quot;Tartar&quot;. The Navy purchased her in 1855 and she participated in several battles in Chinese waters, including having been sunk and recovered. The Navy sold her in 1866 and she went through several changes in ownership before she was broken up in 1876.
* was a 4-gun wooden screw frigate launched in 1856 and in service until at least 1870.

<text>East Otago is the name given to that part of Otago, in the South Island of New Zealand that lies directly to the north of Dunedin. To the south, its limit is approximately the rough hill pass of the Kilmog, 25 kilometres north of Dunedin city centre, and in the north the limit is the Shag River.

The population of East Otago is 2,500 (est 2001)

Expected population in 2006 is 3,000 with 1,400 expecting to live in the Main town of Waikouaiti

Census provisional count for East Otago as of 2006 was 4,991

Census provisional count for East Otago towns was:

*Waikouaiti: 1,620
*Palmerston: 1,246
*Karitane: 720
*Dunback: 320
*Moeraki: 682

4,588 Live in the 5 main centers

403 Live in the rural areas

Total: 4,991

The area contains two main towns, Waikouaiti and Palmerston along with the smaller settlements of Karitane and Dunback.

The name East Otago has fallen somewhat out of favour since the expansion of the city limits of Dunedin to encompass much of this area in the 1990s.

<text>Josephus Flavius Cook (January 26, 1838 – June 24, 1901), commonly known as Joseph Cook, was an American philosophical lecturer, clergyman, and writer. 

==Life and career==
Born in Ticonderoga, New York, he attended Phillips Academy, and then entered Yale College, later transferring to Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1865. He married Georgiana Hemingway on June 30, 1877.

A descendant of Pilgrims, Cook started his ascent to fame by way of Monday noon prayer meetings in Tremont Temple in Boston that for more than twenty years were among the city&#x27;s greatest attractions. In the lectures, Cook attempted to convey recent developments in European science and philosophy in a way that reconciled them to Protestant belief; his commentary stressed social amelioration and civic responsibility. He later travelled the world; his lectures were published and translated into several languages.

In 1871, Cook&#x27;s work exposing the poor conditions in factories in Lynn, Massachusetts was publicly praised by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, however, Cook later became a noted critic of Eddy and her ideas. Eddy responded with a pamphlet, later expanded into the book &quot;&quot; which opposed Cook&#x27;s views on the subject. Eddy also spoke at one of Cook&#x27;s Tremont Temple lectures in defense of Christian Science.

Cook died at his summer home in Ticonderoga on June 24, 1901.

<doc id="1079244" wikidata="Q323245" url="?curid=1079244" title="Antoine Augustin Cournot">
<text>Antoine Augustin Cournot (; 28 August 180131 March 1877) was a French philosopher and mathematician who contributed to the development of economics.

== Biography ==
Antoine Augustin Cournot was born on August 28, 1801 at Gray, Haute-Saône. He entered the preparatory school at Gray in 1809 where he studied until the age of 15. He studied at College Royal of Besancon.

In 1821 he entered one of the most prestigious Grandes Écoles, the École Normale Supérieure, and, according to Sandmo:
in 1823 he took a license degree in mathematics at Sorbonne University. He then became the private secretary of a field marshal who required assistance in writing his memoirs. This position left Cournot with considerable time for his own pursuits. In the course of his ten years in the field marshal&#x27;s employment he took two doctoral degrees, one in mechanics and one in astronomy. In addition, he published a number of articles and even acquired a degree in law.

Subsequently, Cournot held positions as professor of mathematics, chief examiner for undergraduate students, and rector of Dijon Academy.

By the time Cournot died in 1877, he was nearly blind.

== Work ==
===Economics===
Cournot was mainly a mathematician, but had some influence in economics. His theories on monopolies and duopolies are still prevalent. In 1838 the book &quot;Researches on Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth&quot; was published, in which he used the application of the formulas and symbols of mathematics in economic analysis. This book was strongly criticized and scarcely successful during Cournot&#x27;s lifetime. He attempted nonetheless to rewrite it twice. It is influential in economics today. Today many economists believe this book to be the point of departure for modern economic analysis. Cournot introduced the ideas of functions and probability into economic analysis. He derived the first formula for the rule of supply and demand as a function of price and was the first to draw supply and demand curves on a graph , anticipating the work of Alfred Marshall by roughly thirty years. The Cournot duopoly model developed in his book also introduced the concept of a (pure strategy) Nash equilibrium, the reaction function and best-response dynamics.

Cournot believed that economists must utilize the tools of mathematics only to establish probable limits and to express less stable facts in more absolute terms. He further held that the practical uses of mathematics in economics do not necessarily involve strict numerical precision.

In the field of economics he is best known for his work in the field of oligopoly theory, Cournot competition, which is named after him.

=== Philosophy ===
Cournot worked on determinism (in physics) and chance.

Unlike Pierre-Simon de Laplace, who thought that nothing happens by chance, and Aristotle, who thought that randomness and causality had nothing to do with each other, Cournot united the concepts, defining randomness as the
encounter of two independent causal series.
This definition allows randomness even in perfectly deterministic events, and is used to generate random numbers by the combination of unrelated signals (for instance, temperature and sound).

<text>James Edwin Creighton (April 8, 1861, Pictou, Nova Scotia – October 8, 1924, Ithaca, New York) was an American idealist philosopher, Cornell academic, founding president of the American Philosophical Association, and president (1902) of the American Philosophical Society.
==Biography==
Creighton graduated as a Bachelor of Arts from Dalhousie College, Halifax, in 1887, and became a student at the foreign universities of Leipzig and Berlin. Later he came to Cornell University as a graduate student, receiving the degree of Doctor of Philosophy there in 1892. From 1889 to 1892, Dean Creighton was an instructor in philosophy at Cornell, being advanced during the three following years to an associate professorship. He had been Sage professor of logic and metaphysics since 1895, and acted from 1914 to 1923 as Dean of the Graduate School at Cornell. 

As an author, he was best known to students through his “Introductory Logic,” first published in 1898, which is widely employed as a college textbook. He collaborated in the translation of &quot;Wundt&#x27;s Human and Animal Psychology,&quot; and &quot;Paulsen&#x27;s Kant - His Life and Philosophy.&quot; In addition to publishing these books, he had been since 1892 editor of &quot;The Philosophical Review&quot;, and since 1896 American editor of &quot;Kant-Studien.&quot; He was a member of the American Philosophical Society, of which body he served as president in 1902 and 1903. He was also the founding president of the American Philosophical Association. 

He was early influenced by Kant, Bradley and Bosanquet, and later accepted some of the views of Windelband and Heinrich Rickert, without sharing all of their opinions. He constantly defended Idealistic, or speculative, philosophy against Pragmatism, neo-Realism, Materialism, and Berkeleian materialism.

Creighton differentiated between what he considered as intelligible in philosophy and what is intelligible in the natural sciences. He also believed that no system of thought could be the product of an isolated mind. His most important essays were compiled in &quot;Studies in Speculative Philosophy&quot; (Creighton, 1925; see also Sabine, 1917).

Creighton was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by Queen&#x27;s University and Dalhousie University. He remained at Cornell until his death from an extended illness. He is buried at East Lawn Cemetery in Ithaca.

<text>Alexander von Homeyer (19 January 1834, in Vorland, now a part of Splietsdorf – 14 July 1903, in Greifswald) was a German soldier and ornithologist. He was a cousin of Eugen Ferdinand von Homeyer, also an ornithologist.

Homeyer joined the Prussian army in 1852, and as an ensign served with the Silesian Füsilier-Regiment. In 1878 he retired from the military with the rank of major.

He took part in the second expedition of the German African society in 1874, in which he was accompanied by the explorer Paul Pogge. His other travels, during which he collected natural history specimens, included expeditions to the Mediterranean (including the Balearic Islands in 1861), Denmark, Hungary and the Balkans. From the years 1875 to 1884, he was, for the most part, engaged in systematic studies.

Homeyer published over 150 articles on ornithology, and was the first to describe the Cyprus wheatear and the semi-collared flycatcher. As a lepidopterist, he amassed a collection of around 50,000 butterflies. At his death, he left a collection of bird eggs that was one of the largest private collections known to exist — in 1906 it became part of the Senckenberg Nature Research Society.

He died at Greifswald.

<text>Accompong (from the Asante name &quot;Acheampong&quot;) is a historical Maroon village located in the hills of St. Elizabeth Parish on the island of Jamaica. It is located in Cockpit Country, where Jamaican Maroons and Indigenous Taíno established a fortified stronghold in the hilly terrain in the 17th century. They defended it and maintained independence from the Spanish and then later the British, after the colony changed hands.

Accompong is reportedly named after the son of Miguel Reid, the first African Maroon leader in western Jamaica originally from Ghana and allegedly the first leader of Cudjoe&#x27;s Town (Trelawny Town). This would make Accompong brother to Kojo or Cudjoe, and possibly Cuffee, Quaco and Nanny of the Maroons. Accompong Town was reportedly built by Kojo who assigned his Brother Accompong to watch over it.

Accompong is run by a chief who is elected by voting. The current chief is Chief Richard Currie.

==Accompong Town under Accompong==

In the 18th century, Maroon leader Cudjoe is said to have united his people under the Kindah Tree, as they struggled for autonomy. This was the site for signing the 1739 treaty with the British, according to this Maroon town&#x27;s oral history. This legendary, ancient mango tree is still standing (2009). The tree symbolizes the common kinship of the community on its common land. However, the Returned Maroons of Flagstaff believe that the treaty was signed at Petty River Bottom, near the village of Flagstaff.
During the First Maroon War, rebel slaves and their descendants fought a guerrilla war to secure the independence of Free Black people in Jamaica against the British. Hostilities were finally ended by a treaty between the two groups in 1739, signed under British governor Edward Trelawny. It granted Cudjoe&#x27;s Maroons 1500 acres of land between their strongholds of Cudjoe&#x27;s Town (Trelawny Town) and Accompong in the Cockpits. While the treaty granted this land to Trelawny Town, it did not recognize Accompong Town. In 1756, following a land dispute between Maroons from Accompong Town and neighbouring planters, the Assembly specifically granted Accompong Town an additional 1,000 acres of land.

The treaty also granted the Maroons a certain amount of political autonomy and economic freedoms, in return for their providing military support in case of invasion or rebellion. They also had to agree to return runaway slaves, for which they were paid a bounty of two dollars each. This last clause in the treaty caused tension between the Maroons and the enslaved Black population. From time to time refugees from the plantations continued to find their way to Maroon settlements and were sometimes allowed to stay. However, Accompong Maroons earned an income from hunting runaways on behalf of neighbouring planters.

After the treaty, Cudjoe ruled Trelawny Town, while his brother-in-arms, Accompong, ruled Accompong Town. In 1751, planter Thomas Thistlewood recorded meeting Accompong, whom he called &#x27;Capt. Compoon&#x27;. The planter described the Maroon leader as &quot;about my size, in a Ruffled Shirt, Blue Broad Cloth Coat, Scarlet Cuffs to his Sleeves, gold buttons...and Black Hatt, White linen Breeches puff’d at the knee, no stockings or shoes on&quot;.

In 1755, Zacharias Caries wrote in his diary that when he met Accompong, the Maroon leader wore &quot;an embroidered waistcoat, gold lace around his hat, a silver chain about his neck to which was hung a silver medal wherein.&quot; Accompong also had &quot;ear rings, and on each of his fingers...rings of silver,&quot; but that he still went barefoot.

==Accompong tries to take over Trelawny Town==

In the 1760s, the Maroons of Accompong Town played a significant role in suppressing rebellions inspired by Tacky&#x27;s War in western Jamaica. Captain Quashee, reporting to superintendent John Kelly, and his Maroon warriors captured a number of rebel slaves.

Some historians believe that there were no official records of Accompong after the 1750s. However, there is evidence that Accompong tried to take over Trelawny Town in the mid-1760s.

The treaty of 1739 named Accompong as Cudjoe&#x27;s successor. When Cudjoe died in 1764, Accompong tried to take control of Trelawny Town. The governor, Roger Hope Elletson, asserted authority over the Leeward Maroons. Elletson instructed Superintendent John James to take the Trelawny Town badge of authority away from Accompong, and to give it to a Trelawny Town Maroon officer named Lewis. James instructed Accompong that he had authority only over Accompong Town. 

Accompong seems to have died in the decade that followed. After Cudjoe and Accompong died, control of the Leeward Maroon towns passed to white superintendents, who were appointed by the governor to supervise the Maroon towns. In 1773 it was reported that the white superintendent had appointed Maroon captains Crankey and Muncko as the officers reporting to him in Accompong Town.

==Accompong Town after Accompong==

Accompong Town&#x27;s population grew from 85 in 1740 to 119 in 1770, to 159 in 1788.

When the Second Maroon War broke out in 1795, the Maroons of Trelawny Town took up arms against the British colonial authorities, but the Accompong Maroons under the nominal leadership of Maroon Captain John Foster swore allegiance to the British. The Maroons of Accompong Town fought on behalf of the British colonial authorities against Trelawny Town. During this period, the de facto leadership of Accompong Town was held by its white superintendent, Alexander Forbes, who ensured that the Accompong Maroons remained loyal to the British colonial administration.

Accompong Town suffered losses in the Second Maroon War. When Maroon Captain Chambers was sent to Trelawny Town to secure their surrender, Captain James Palmer of Trelawny Town shot him and cut off the Accompong captain&#x27;s head. Militia colonel William Fitch, newly arrived in Jamaica, ignored the advice of his experienced Maroon trackers. He led his forces into a Trelawny Town ambush; their warriors killed Fitch, many members of the white militia, and a number of Accompong warriors.

During the course of the Second Maroon War, the Maroons of Accompong broke up a longstanding settlement of runaway slaves in the Cockpit Country called the Congo Settlement, which had been formed in the 1770s. Many of the survivors of this community went on to fight on the side of Trelawny Town in the Second Maroon War.

==After the deportation of Trelawny Town==

Accompong Town backed the winning side. After the Maroons of Trelawny Town were deported to Nova Scotia, the colonial authorities granted Accompong the sole rights to hunt runaway slaves. But the Accompong Maroons were unsuccessful in attempts to disperse or capture the runaway community of Cuffee. Soon the colonial authorities reinstated slave hunting rights to the Windward Maroons.

When Cuffee&#x27;s group faded from the colonial records, other refugee slaves established a Maroon community in Cockpit Country in 1812. The community of Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come also resisted attempts by the Accompong Maroons and the colonial militias to disperse them in the 1820s.

In 1808, the population of Accompong Town was 238, but it almost doubled to 436 in 1841.

The Accompong Maroons played a significant role in helping the colonial militia of Sir Willoughby Cotton to put down the Christmas Rebellion of 1831–2, also known as the Baptist War, led by Samuel Sharpe.

==Government==
In two settlements, they set up a traditional form of village government drawn from their Akan (Asante) culture, based on men popularly recognized as leaders. The executive is now called &quot;Colonel-in-Chief&quot;, who leads the Maroon Council. These men share executive responsibilities for the community.

=== Maroon officers ===
===White superintendents===
==Late 20th century to present==
Since Jamaica gained independence in 1962, it has recognised the political and cultural rights of Maroons. In the early 21st century, the government has acknowledged these rights in terms of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007), including the &quot;right to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions.&quot; It also acknowledges the &quot;right for self-government in matters relating to local affairs,&quot; as well as &quot;ways and means for financing autonomous functions&quot;.

In 2009 Ferron Williams was elected as Colonel-in-Chief of Accompong. Williams was elected to a second six-year term in 2015. He appointed Timothy E. McPherson Jr. from Nanny Town, now Moore Town, to consolidate relations across the Maroon communities as part of a collective effort to protect the environment and promote climate change awareness.

In February 2021 Richard Currie was elected Colonel-in-Chief.

==Culture==
The inhabitants of Accompong share practices and traditions drawn from their Akan (Asante) ancestors of 200–300 years ago, and combined with Taino. These practices have evolved as the Maroons adapted to local conditions.

Accompong Town converted to Christianity during the Second Maroon War, before eventually embracing Presbyterianism. However, by the 1850s, the traditions of Revival and Pentecostalism grew out of the merging of West African religions with Christianity.

Descendants of the Maroons and friends celebrate annually on 6 January both the birthday of Cudjoe, leader in 1739, and the treaty that granted their autonomy. In 2007, attendees at the festival protested increased bauxite mining, in an effort to protect the environment of their region.

<doc id="1079264" wikidata="Q3150702" url="?curid=1079264" title="Mounted infantry">
<text>Mounted infantry were infantry who rode horses instead of marching. Unlike cavalry, mounted infantry dismounted to fight on foot. The original dragoons were essentially mounted infantry. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot; (1910-1911), &quot;Mounted rifles are half cavalry, mounted infantry merely specially mobile infantry.&quot; Today, with motor vehicles having replaced horses for military transport, the motorized infantry are in some respects successors to mounted infantry.

==History==

===Pre-gunpowder===
The origins of mounted infantry go back to at least the beginnings of organised warfare. With the weight of ancient bronze armor, the opposing champions would travel to battle on chariots before dismounting to fight. With the evolution of hoplite warfare, some hoplites would travel to battle on horseback, before dismounting to take their place in the phalanx. The early pre-Marian Roman military had units consisting of infantrymen clinging to the saddles of the cavalry to take them to battle and then dismounting to fight. Gallic and Germanic warbands were reported to use double-riders, with a second warrior joining a horseman only for a short distance before dismounting to fight on foot.
The Han dynasty also extensively used mounted infantry in their campaigns against the Xiongnu confederation. During many of the Han campaigns, the vast majority of the army rode on horseback;
either as mounted cavalry or mounted infantry who fought dismounted.
The Arabs, during their campaigns in the deserts of Mesopotamia and Syria against the Byzantines and Sassanids, used camels to enhance their mobility, marking a stark contrast to their enemies, especially in the desert environment. The Carolingians under Charlemagne also used horses as transport for the bulk of their army, and special care was taken to ensure the health, fodder, and availability of horses on-campaign.
Other notable infantry to use horses to enhance their mobility include the Genoese crossbowmen, and Viking raiders who would gather all the horses they could find in the vicinity of their landings.

=== Dragoons ===

Dragoons originally were mounted infantry, who were trained in horse riding as well as infantry fighting skills. However, usage altered over time and during the 18th century, dragoons evolved into conventional light cavalry units and personnel. Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th century and early 18th century.

The name is possibly derived from a type of firearm (called a ) carried by dragoons of the French Army. There is no distinction between the words and in French.

The title has been retained in modern times by a number of armoured or ceremonial mounted regiments.

===19th century===
With the invention of accurate and quick firing repeating pistols and rifles in the mid-19th century, cavalry started to become increasingly vulnerable. Many armies started to use troops which could either fight on horseback or on foot as circumstances dictated. Fighting on horseback with swords and lances would allow rapid movement without cover from enemy fire, whilst fighting on foot with pistols and rifles allowed them to make use of cover and to form defensive lines.

The first mounted infantry units were raised during the Mexican–American War (as the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen, but redesignated Third Cavalry Regiment in 1861), and others followed, for example in Australia in the 1880s. Terms such as &quot;mounted rifles&quot; or &quot;Light Horse&quot; were often used.

The French Foreign Legion used mule-mounted companies from the 1880s. Each mule was shared by two legionnaires, who took turns in riding it. This arrangement allowed faster and more prolonged marches that could cover in one day.

In the Western Theater of the American Civil War, several infantry regiments were converted to mounted infantry and armed with repeating rifles. The Lightning Brigade at the Battle of Chickamauga was an example of these Union mounted infantry units.

In the British Army, infantry units in some parts of the British Empire had a mounted platoon for scouting and skirmishing. In addition, many locally raised units such as the Ceylon Mounted Rifles, Cape Mounted Rifles, Natal Carbineers, and Marshall&#x27;s Horse fought as mounted infantry.

In the Second Boer War, the British copied the Boers and raised large forces of their own mounted infantry. Among various ad hoc formations, the Imperial Yeomanry was raised from volunteers in Britain between 1900 and 1901. Many of the contingents from Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (e.g. the Australian Light Horse and the Canadian Mounted Rifles) were MI (mounted infantry), as well as locally raised irregulars like the Imperial Light Horse and South African Light Horse. As artillery was of limited use against scattered Boer guerrilla bands later in the war, the mounted personnel of Royal Artillery units were formed into Royal Artillery Mounted Rifles.

As part of the lessons learned from that war, British regular cavalry regiments were armed with the same rifle as the infantry and became well-trained in dismounted tactics. A version of the standard infantry rifle, the shorter-barreled LEC or &quot;Lee-Enfield Cavalry Carbine Mark I&quot; had been introduced in 1896.

===20th century===

Many European armies also used bicycle infantry in a similar way that mounted infantry used horses. However they were handicapped by the need for proper roads.

The Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade which took part in the cavalry charge in the Battle of Beersheba (1917) during World War I are labelled as mounted infantry brigade in popular media; however, they were in fact mounted rifles as were the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade which also took part in this battle. Mounted rifles regiments lack the mass of a mounted infantry battalions, as a light horse brigade could only muster as many rifles in the line as a single battalion. Consequently, their employment reflected this lack of mass, with the tactics seeking to harness greater mobility and fire to overcome opposition, rather than echeloned mass attacks.

Mounted infantry began to disappear with the shift from horses to motor vehicles in the 1920s and 1930s. Germany deployed a few horse-mounted infantry units on the Russian Front during the Second World War, and cyclist units on both fronts as well, and both Germany and Britain (which had used cyclist battalions in the First World War) experimented with motorcycle battalions. Germany also utilized organic horse and bicycle mounted troops within infantry formations throughout World War Two, although bicycle use increased as Germany retreated into its own territory. Japan deployed cyclists to great effect in its 1941 to 1942 campaign in Malaya and drive on Singapore during World War II. A horsed cavalry regiment of the Philippine Scouts assisted in the defense of the Philippines at the onset of World War II. The 10th Mountain Division of the U.S. Army also maintained a mounted reconnaissance troop throughout World War Two, which saw service in Italy and Austria during the war.

Countries with entrenched military traditions, such as Switzerland, retained horse-mounted troops well into the Cold War, while Sweden kept much of its infantry on bicycles during the snow-free months.

<text>Realization, also called Biographie, is a circa sport climbing route on an overhanging limestone cliff on the southern face of Céüse mountain, near Gap and Sigoyer, in France. After it was first climbed in 2001 by American climber Chris Sharma, it became the first rock climb in the world to have a consensus grade of . It is considered an historic and important route in rock climbing, and one of the most attempted climbs at its grade.

==History==
In 1989, French climber Jean-Christophe Lafaille bolted the entire circa 35 metre pitch, and named it &quot;Biographie&quot; (he was not able to climb it). &quot;Biographie&quot; remained a long-standing open project, and in 1996, French climber freed the lower half of the route, added an anchor at his high-point and graded it at . Petit estimated that the remaining unclimbed section was about but had a very difficult boulder problem that he could not overcome. American climber Chris Sharma made over 30 attempts from 1996 to 2000 but could also not overcome the boulder move. In 2001, Sharma skipped the Bouldering World Cup in Gap, and after three days working on the route, on 18 July 2001, successfully free climbed the route, linking up Petit&#x27;s first section to Lafaille&#x27;s final bolt.

Sharma&#x27;s first ascent was captured in Josh Lowell&#x27;s 2002 climbing film, &quot;Dosage Volume 1&quot;. Witnessing his ascent was a 10-year old , who was out hiking with her father.

Sharma did not assign a grade to the climb. however he did name it &quot;Realization&quot;. The naming was a source of controversy as in France climbing routes are named by the person who first bolted the route, while in the U.S. (and the U.K.), they are named by the first person to successfully free climb the route. Sharma would later clarify: 

Though only aged 20, Sharma considered retiring after completing the ascent, but found new inspiration in extreme deep-water soloing routes in Mallorca. It took almost three years until the second ascent was made by French climber, Sylvain Millet, who also refused to grade it given his lack of experience of other equivalent reference climbs, however, he noted that the failure of other strong climbers to repeat the route (e.g. Patxi Usobiaga, and Dave Graham), implied that 9a+ was the likely grade.

On 24 September 2017, American climber Margo Hayes became the first female climber to climb the route. On 5 August 2020, German climber Alexander Megos created &quot;Bibliographie&quot;, a route, a few metres to the right of &quot;Realization/Biographie&quot;.

==Route==
The route starts with an immediate hard &quot;four-move boulder problem&quot;, which partially broke in 2010, potentially rendering the lower section even more difficult (it has been compared to the notable bouldering problem, &quot;Necessarily Evil&quot;). Sustained 5.13 climbing after the initial bouldering problem leads to the main rest, a large right-facing flake. After this pause, a series of &quot;super-resistant two and three-finger pocket moves&quot;, with cross-throughs, underclings, and high-steps lead to Arnaud Petit&#x27;s old anchor (now since removed), which is almost halfway. 

To the anchor, the route is considered , although some have suggested an upgrade to due to the initial bottom boulder breaking. There is a small rest at the old anchor, then sustained resistance climbing leads to a slightly better rest just below the finishing crux. This final crux is 12 moves, described as &quot;a bunch of foot movement, and some very fickle pockets and crimps&quot;. Its difficulty is amplified by the amount of hard climbing undertaken to reach it. Above this crux is a small rest, and 5.11 climbing for 50 feet leads to the final anchor at around the circa 35-meter mark&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot;Realization&quot; was the first route to carry a consensus grade, and &quot;Climbing&quot; called it a &quot;technical revolution&quot; in rock climbing. The quality and sustained difficulty of &quot;Realization&quot; means it is still considered an important rite-of-passage for the world&#x27;s best rock climbers, whose repeat ascents of the &quot;legendary&quot; route, are covered by the climbing media. &quot;Outside&quot; magazine called it &quot;the benchmark for the grade&quot;, and it has become one of the most attempted and repeated routes at the grade at . In 2014, &quot;National Geographic&quot; called it, &quot;one of the most famous sport-climbing routes in the world&quot;. &quot;PlanetMountain&quot; included &quot;Realization&quot; on its list of important climbs in the evolution of free climbing (1918–2013).

In 2012, when Adam Ondra attempted to flash the route (i.e. complete on the first attempt) he said: &quot;It had always been my long-term crazy dream to flash this route&quot;. In 2014, when American climber Jonathan Siegrist made the eighth ascent of the route and told &quot;Outside&quot; magazine: &quot;I can remember the first time that I saw the route — it is truly magnificent. I was shocked to see that such a bold and impressive, seemingly perfect line exists. Add to that, the historic significance of this climb, not to mention its unique and brilliant holds and movement — it really is a proud route&quot;. On repeating the route in 2014, German climber Alexander Megos said: &quot;I wanted to climb this route because it is the world’s first 9a+ and definitely one of the most famous routes worldwide! But it’s not just the history behind the route, also the route itself is one of the best ones I ever climbed!&quot;. In 2016, remembering his own 2015 repeat of the route, Italian climber Stefano Ghisolfi called it, &quot;..perhaps the most famous cutting-edge route in the world&quot;.

===Subsequent first 9a+ contendors===

Many years after the ascent of &quot;Realization&quot;, other earlier sport climbs have been revisited as potential first-ever 9a+ routes:

* In 2008, Adam Ondra completed the second ascent of Alexander Huber&#x27;s 1996 route &quot;&quot; at Austria&#x27;s Schleierfall, and felt it was ; Huber freed it in 1996 and graded it as , but Ondra felt that &quot;Open Air&quot; was harder than &quot;benchmark&quot; climbs such as &quot;Weiss Rose&quot;, &quot;Action Directe&quot;, and even &quot;La Rambla&quot;, which are or . Climbing author Andrew Bisharat noted in a 2016 essay on regrading, that &quot;The other interesting point about Open Air that’s worth mentioning is that the route reportedly contains some rather flaky holds that have broken off over the years. So was the Open Air that Ondra climbed the exact same route that Alex Huber climbed? Maybe, but probably not.&quot;

* In 2021, Will Bosi completed the second ascent of Steve McClure&#x27;s 1998 route &quot;Mutation&quot; at Raven Tor crag in Millers Dale, in the Peak District in England, and felt it was ; McClure freed it in 1998 and graded it as . Bosi felt it was possibly even .

<text>The Green Ecologist Party (, PEV) was a Chilean political party and one of South America&#x27;s members of the global green movement.

==History==
It is the first Chilean ecologist political party legalized after the disappearance of The Greens (1987–2001) and Environmentalist Movement (1993–1994), the first officially affiliated with the Global Greens.

It participated in the municipal elections of 2008 in an alliance («For a clean Chile») with the Independent Regionalist Party (PRI) and ChileFirst (CH1) movement. It managed to choose 1 councilor as an independent in the municipality of San Pedro de La Paz. In the parliamentary elections the following year it formed the New Majority for Chile pact with the Humanist Party and supported the presidential candidacy of Marco Enríquez-Ominami. In the municipal elections of 2012 it joined Change for You in conjunction with the Progressive Party.

For the presidential election of 2013, and after carrying out a process of internal primary among its members, proclaimed as presidential candidate to the economist Alfredo Sfeir, who obtained 2.35% of the vote. In parliamentary and regional councilors elections that same year participated in coalition with the Equality Party by New Constitution for Chile pact. No deputies or senators won, but won the election of Felix Gonzalez as regional councilor of the Province of Concepción.

Before the elections of 2013, the community was legalized by the name of Green Ecologist Party of North in three regions of northern Chile. Both the Green Ecologist Party North as the Green Party itself did not reach 5% of the votes, and for that reason they were dissolved by the Electoral Service. Given this, both parties decided to merge, in a process that was completed on April 15, 2014.

The party joined the Broad Front coalition for the 2017 elections, achieving its first seat in congress with its leader, Félix González as its candidate for Concepción. Its presence in the coalition lasted until 2019, when it suspended and subsequently terminated its membership over part of the groups decision of participating of an accord with the government during widespread protests.

The February 7, 2022, SERVEL announced the dissolution of several parties that did not meet the 5% minimum vote threshold at the last election to maintain registration, including the &quot;Partido Ecologista Verde&quot;. Its members in the Chamber of Deputies thereafter sat as independents.

== Presidential candidates ==

<doc id="1079288" wikidata="Q1161669" url="?curid=1079288" title="Daniel Mannix">
<text>Daniel Patrick Mannix (4 March 1864 – 6 November 1963) was an Irish-born Australian Catholic bishop. Mannix was the Archbishop of Melbourne for 46 years and one of the most influential public figures in 20th-century Australia.

==Early life and education==
Born near Charleville in County Cork, Ireland, Mannix was the son of a tenant farmer, Timothy Mannix, and his wife Ellen (née Cagney). He was educated at Congregation of Christian Brothers schools and then completed his seminary studies at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, where he was ordained as a priest.

Mannix was president of St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, the Irish national seminary, from 13 October 1903 to 10 August 1912 when he was succeeded by the Rt Reverend John F. Hogan. During his presidency, he welcomed both Edward VII in 1903 and George V in 1911 with loyal displays, which attracted criticism by supporters of the Irish Home Rule movement. Mannix was also involved in the controversy surrounding the dismissal of Father Michael O&#x27;Hickey as Professor of Irish after O&#x27;Hickey publicly attacked those members of the senate of the National University of Ireland who opposed making Irish a compulsory subject for matriculation and insinuated that the senators (who included several bishops) had sinned grievously by so doing and resembled those MPs who were bribed to pass the Act of Union.

==Ecclesiastical career==
On 1 July 1912, Mannix was consecrated titular bishop of Pharsalia and coadjutor bishop to Archbishop Carr of Melbourne at Maynooth College Chapel. Mannix was not consulted about his appointment. Melbourne was one of the large centres of Irish emigration, where the Roman Catholic Church was almost entirely Irish. In Australia at this time, the Irish Catholics were commonly treated with disdain by the English and Scottish majority (who were mostly Anglicans and Presbyterians respectively) and also as potentially disloyal. Mannix was regarded with suspicion from the start and his militant advocacy on behalf of a separate Roman Catholic school system, in defiance of the general acceptance of a secular school system, made him immediately a figure of controversy.

In 1914 Australia entered World War I on the side of the United Kingdom and when Mannix denounced the war as &quot;just a sordid trade war&quot;, he was widely denounced as a traitor. When the Australian Labor Party government of Billy Hughes tried to introduce conscription for the war, Mannix campaigned against it and it was defeated. He spoke out more frequently about the 1917 referendum, which was also defeated. This campaign included a speech before a huge crowd of perhaps 100,000 at the Richmond Racecourse, which was provided by John Wren. The extent to which Mannix influenced the outcome of the vote has been debated widely. When the Labor Party split over conscription, Mannix supported the Catholic-dominated anti-conscription faction, led by Frank Tudor (although Tudor was not a Catholic). Among the Catholic politicians whose careers he encouraged were James Scullin, Frank Brennan, Joseph Lyons and, later, Arthur Calwell. In 1917, when Carr died, Mannix became Archbishop of Melbourne.

==Views==
Mannix opposed the Easter Rising in 1916 and always condemned the use of force by Irish nationalists. He also counselled Australians of Irish Catholic extraction to stay out of Irish politics. He became, however, increasingly radicalised and in October 1920 led an Irish republican funeral cortège through the streets of London following the death of the hunger striker Terence MacSwiney, the Lord Mayor of Cork City in Mannix&#x27;s native county. He was involved in the production of the film &quot;Ireland Will Be Free&quot;.

In 1920, Mannix travelled from Melbourne to San Francisco and then by train he journeyed to New York in order to take passage on the White Star Line ship the &quot;RMS Baltic&quot; to Ireland. A rally reported to be made up of 15,000 New York Irish was organised on 31 July at the White Star Line docks at Pier 60, Chelsea Piers on the West side of New York. This show of support was to send off Mannix, who had been so outspoken on the English rule in Ireland, and successfully led anti-conscription campaigns during World War I. The rally ensured that David Lloyd George would allow Mannix passage to Ireland. However shortly before the &quot;RMS Baltic&quot; was due to arrive in Cork Harbour, it was stopped and boarded by British military, who arrested Mannix and transferred him directly to England.
By the end of the war, Mannix was the recognised leader of the Irish community in Australia, idolised by Catholics but detested by others, including those in power federally and in Victoria. He had spoken against the Treaty of Versailles, saying it would lead to a greater war than the one just ended. For many years he was ostracised and not invited to the official functions his position would have entitled him to attend. Mannix formed the Irish Relief Fund, which provided financial support for the families of those shot or imprisoned by the British. When he left Australia in 1920, to visit Rome and the United States, the British government refused him permission to visit Ireland or British cities with large Irish populations, which resulted in an extended stay in Penzance. There was also a serious, though unsuccessful, move to prevent him from returning to Australia.

Mannix supported trade unionism but opposed militancy and strikes. In the 1920s he became outspoken in opposition to the Industrial Workers of the World and the Communist Party of Australia. On all matters of personal and sexual morality, he was a traditionalist and an upholder of the authority of the Church.

In Melbourne, Mannix was the leader of the city&#x27;s largest ethnic minority as well as a religious leader. From his palatial house, &quot;Raheen&quot;, in Kew, Melbourne, he would daily walk to and from St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, personally greeting any of his flock that he encountered. On official engagements, he was chauffeured about in a large limousine. In 1920 he led large St Patrick&#x27;s Day parade with a guard of honour made up of Irish Australian winners of the Victoria Cross.

After the Irish Free State was created in 1922, Mannix became less politically controversial and animosity to him gradually faded for the most part. From the 1930s he came to see Communism as the main threat to the church and he became increasingly identified with political conservatism. He was a strong supporter of Joseph Lyons, who left the Labor Party in 1931 and led the conservative United Australia Party in government from 1932 until 1939, although he continued to support Catholics in the Labor Party such as Arthur Calwell.

Mannix&#x27;s best-known protégé in his later years was B. A. Santamaria, a young Italian-Australian lawyer, whom Mannix appointed head of the national secretariat of Catholic Action in 1937. After 1941, Mannix authorised Santamaria to form the Catholic Social Studies Movement, known simply as &quot;The Movement&quot;, to organise in the unions and defeat the Communists. &quot;The Movement&quot; was so successful in its efforts that by 1949 it had taken control of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. Another associate was William Hackett SJ, a Jesuit priest from Ireland, who had been involved in the Irish Republic&#x27;s struggle for independence from Britain before being posted to Australia.

In 1951 the Liberal government of Robert Menzies held a referendum to give the government the constitutional power to ban the Communist Party. Mannix surprised many of his supporters by opposing this, on the grounds that the bill was totalitarianism, which in his view was worse than communism: his may have been a decisive influence in the referendum&#x27;s narrow defeat. This alliance with the Labor leader, H. V. Evatt, was short-lived.

The Labor Party split again in 1954 over attitudes to Communism and the Cold War. Santamaria&#x27;s supporters were expelled and formed the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). Mannix covertly supported the DLP and allowed many priests and religious to work openly for it. This involvement in politics was opposed by Cardinal Sir Norman Gilroy, Archbishop of Sydney, who worked with the Catholic Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, to hold together the Labor Party in that state, and also by the Vatican which, in 1957, ruled that the Movement should not interfere in politics. Rome appointed Archbishop Justin Simonds as coadjutor to Mannix – Simonds was widely seen as Rome&#x27;s man in Melbourne.

In the late 1940s and 1950s, Mannix spoke against the White Australia policy, which was in effect at the time. He described the policy as &quot;crude&quot; and said that Australia had much to learn from other races. In his opposition to the policy, Mannix stated in 1949 that &quot;there is no colour bar in Australia&quot;.

He continued his friendship with long-time Irish leader Éamon de Valera, with the two men continuing their correspondence when Mannix was aged 98 years.

In 1960, Calwell became Labor leader and sought Mannix&#x27;s support to bring about a reconciliation between Labor and the DLP, essential if the Menzies government was to be defeated. Some figures in the DLP supported this idea, but Mannix supported Santamaria in his resistance to such suggestions. The negotiations fell through and Menzies was re-elected in 1961. Mannix and Calwell became permanently estranged.

By the 1960s the distinct identity of the Irish community in Melbourne was fading, and Irish Catholics were increasingly outnumbered by Italian, Croatian, Polish, Maltese and other postwar immigrant Catholic communities. Mannix, who turned 90 in 1954, remained active and in full authority, but he was no longer a central figure in the city&#x27;s politics. He died suddenly on 7 November 1963, aged 99, while the archdiocese was preparing to celebrate his 100th birthday. He was buried in the crypt of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne.

==Legacy==
Mannix&#x27;s legacy to the Roman Catholic Church in Australia is substantial. Over fifty years during his episcopacy, the number of archdiocesan parishioners increased from 150,000 to 600,000; churches from 160 to 300; students in Catholic primary schools from 21,792 to 73,695; secondary pupils from 3,126 to 28,395; priests increased by 237, brothers by 181, nuns by 736; 10 new male and 14 female orders were introduced; 10 seminaries and 7 new hospitals, 3 orphanages, homes for delinquents, the blind and deaf, hostels for girls, and a range of other church facilities.

In recognition of his influence across both church and state, the Catholic Church commissioned a statue of Mannix (pictured above) which is located in the forecourt of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne, facing Parliament House. The bronze and marble sculpture was unveiled by the Governor of Victoria, Sir James Gobbo, in March 1999. The statue replaced an existing one of Daniel O&#x27;Connell.

A number of facilities are named in his honour, others were established by Mannix, as listed below:

===Established by Mannix===

<text>The 46th New Zealand Parliament was a term of the New Zealand Parliament. Its composition was determined by the 1999 election, and it sat until the 2002 election.

The 46th Parliament marked a change of government, with a coalition of the Labour Party and the Alliance taking office. Helen Clark replaced Jenny Shipley as Prime Minister. The National Party, which had formed a minority government for the last part of the 45th Parliament, became the largest opposition party, eventually emerging under a new leader, Bill English. Other parties in Parliament were ACT, the Greens, New Zealand First, and United. Several parties represented at the end of the previous Parliament, such as Mauri Pacific, were wiped out, failing to retain any of their seats.

The 46th Parliament consisted of one hundred and twenty representatives. Sixty-seven of these representatives were chosen by geographical electorates, including six Māori electorates. The remainder were elected by means of party-list proportional representation under the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system.

<text>The Amoskeag Locomotive Works, in Manchester, New Hampshire, built steam locomotives at the dawn of the railroad era in the United States. The locomotive works operated as a division of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company between 1848 and 1859.

Besides building locomotives for railroad use, Amoskeag also built steam fire engines until 1876. A steam-driven self-propelled appliance was made by Amoskeag was used to fight the Great Boston Fire of 1872. Amoskeag fire engines served as the initial fleet for the New York City Fire Department and the first Los Angeles Fire Department fire company. The Firefighters Museum in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, has an 1863 Amoskeag fire engine.

==Company history==
The locomotive manufacturing operations began within a new machine shop built for the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company. The shop opened in 1848, and the first locomotive was built there in 1849. In 1856 the shop built 60 locomotives.

In 1859 Amoskeag Manufacturing sold the locomotive business to Manchester Locomotive Works, of which Oliver W. Bayley and Aretas Blood were principals. Amoskeag Manufacturing sold the fire engine business to the Manchester Locomotive Works in 1876.

<doc id="1079302" wikidata="Q2446861" url="?curid=1079302" title="Dundrum, Dublin">
<text>Dundrum (), originally a village in its own right, is an outer suburb of Dublin, Ireland. The area is located in the postal districts of Dublin 14 and Dublin 16. Dundrum is home to the Dundrum Town Centre, the largest shopping centre in Ireland.

==History==
One of the earliest mentions of the area concerns the location of the original St. Nahi&#x27;s Church in the 8th century on which site today&#x27;s 18th-century church currently stands. The ancient name for Dundrum is &quot;Taney&quot; which derives from &quot;Tigh Naithi&quot; meaning the house or place of Nath Í.

Modern archaeological excavations near the church have revealed three enclosures associated with the church, the earliest dating from the 6th century, and one of the finds included an almost complete Flemish Redware jug from the 13th century.

The first reference to the placename of Taney occurs in the Charter of St. Laurence O&#x27;Toole to Christchurch in 1178 as &quot;half of Rathnahi&quot; and in the following year in a Papal bull of Pope Alexander III to the same archbishop as &quot;&quot;Medietatem de Tignai&quot;. Variations of the spelling continued until the mid-16th century.

When the Normans arrived in 1169, a series of fortifications were built around Dublin. A castle was built in Dundrum as part of this series of outer fortifications around the 13th century. Later in 1590, a newer castle was built by &quot;Richard Fitzwilliam&quot; as part of a strategic line of castles within the Pale. The original village clustered around Dundrum Castle and was a rural defensive outpost against assaults and raids from Irish tribes and families such as the &quot;O&#x27;Tooles&quot; and the &quot;O&#x27;Byrnes&quot;. In 1619, a relation, William FitzWilliam, 3rd Viscount FitzWilliam was granted the castle in recognition of his courage while defending against these assaults but was driven out in 1642. He returned by 1646 but left again, never to return, in 1653. His family held onto the Fitzwilliam seat until 1790. The castle was never reoccupied and exists today as ruins overlooking the Dundrum bypass and the shopping centre. Excavations in 1989 recovered green glazed pottery known as &quot;Leinster Ware&quot;, shells from oysters and cockles, animal bones, and shards of pottery from &quot;Saintongue&quot; in France probably used for storing wine.

The arrival of Richard Fitzwilliam and the building of the castle established commercial activity in the region. The village was home to &quot;The Manor Mill&quot;&quot; where corn was ground into flour. An overflow waterfall was also used by a paper mill and an ironworks.

In 1813, the original Roman Catholic church (Holy Cross) on Main Street was built. It was replaced by a larger building in 1878 and marked when Dundrum was constituted a separate parish from the area previously covered by Booterstown. A large extension was built in 1956. The church is built in a Gothic style from Dublin granite with Portland and Bath stone used for the surrounds of windows and doors.

In 1818, Christ Church (Church of Ireland) on Taney Road was opened as a replacement for a smaller church that stood on the same site. Selling pew sites raised funding for the new building, and the sale of 18 pews on the ground and 8 on the gallery raised nearly £400. The architect for the new church was William Farrell.

In the summer of 1846, Thomas Carlyle travelled from Scotland to Dundrum to spend time with his close friend Charles Gavan Duffy, one of the co-founders of Young Ireland. Joining Duffy were &quot;most of the writers and orators on whom their contemporaries bestowed the sobriquet of Young Ireland&quot;.
The village expanded greatly after the arrival of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway (DSER) in 1854. By 1876, the &quot;Manor Mill&quot; became a laundry and was the largest employer of female labour in the region, The laundry hooter was a regular sound in its day, and would sound at 7.50 am for thirty seconds, then at 8 am to start work, and also at 13.50, 14.00, and finally at 16.50 and 17.00.

In 1881, a local builder, John Richardson, erected 26 cottages known as the &quot;Pembroke Cottages.&quot; The Manor Mill Laundry bought six of these cottages for its workers.

In 1893, a Dublin solicitor named Trevor Overend purchased a 19th-century farmhouse. Today, this building is named Airfield House and is open to the public.

The Dun Emer Press was founded at Dundrum by Elizabeth Yeats, assisted by her brother William Butler Yeats, in 1903.

In 1914, a Carnegie Library was opened by the then Lord Chancellor. Originally, the library was used as an entertainment facility for the community and the upper floor was equipped with a stage and even a kitchen. The building was also used as a school until the 1950s.

In 1971, Dundrum was one of the earliest places in Ireland to open a purpose-built shopping centre (the first being in Stillorgan). A much bigger shopping centre opened just south of Dundrum in March 2005. Known as Dundrum Town Centre, it contains within the complex one of the largest cinemas in Ireland, opened in early October 2005. Plans to redevelop the old shopping centre included proposed space for hotels, apartments and more retail outlets. However this was postponed and the older retail units were leased to new tenants, and the old &#x27;Dundrum Shopping Centre&#x27; was rebranded as &#x27;Dundrum Village Centre&#x27;.

==Amenities==
In the village centre are the old shopping centre, with a Lidl supermarket, an Insomnia cafe, a furniture store and a butcher&#x27;s shop. Across the road to one side is the Dundrum College of Further Education (operated by the local Education and Training Board), while to the other side is the public library. The Dundrum Town Centre contains a wide range of shops and service outlets.

==Transport==
===Luas===

The Luas Green Line has two stops in Dundrum, Balally (which serves the shopping centre) and Dundrum, before the line passes over the large cable-stayed William Dargan Bridge, at Taney Cross. It is the largest engineering structure on the line.

The Luas route substantially follows the original Harcourt Street railway line, which was operated by the DSER from Dublin to Bray. Closed in 1958, the alignment was preserved intact for several decades until it was taken over by the Luas. Dundrum railway station opened on 10 July 1854 and closed on 1 January 1959.

The planned Dublin Metro, Metrolink was proposed to stop at Dundrum&#x27;s Luas stop on its way from Swords to Sandyford. If completed according to original proposals, MetroLink would replace the current Luas services that run along the Luas Green Line. As of February 2019 however, it was questioned whether these plans would be completed as proposed.

===Bus===
A number of bus routes serve Dundrum. These are operated by Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland, and include route 14 to Beaumont, 44 (serving DCU), 44b (to Glencullen), 74 (Eden Quay to Dundrum), 116 (Parnell Square), 161 (Rockbrook), L25 (Dún Laoghaire to Dundrum) and S6 (Blackrock to Tallaght)

In addition, private operator Dublin Coach serves Dublin Airport via the Red Cow interchange.

==People==
The 19th-century Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney, the first person to posit the existence of the electron, resided in Dundrum for much of his adult life. Dundrum was also the home of Séamus Brennan, former Minister of Social and Family Affairs, and is the family home of cyclist Stephen Roche. The operatic singers Charles Manners and Fanny Moody retired here and died here. Dundrum was also the childhood home for Radio One DJ Annie Mac. RTÉ host Derek Mooney lives in Holy Well. Oscar-winner Brenda Fricker grew up here. Many of Eavan Boland&#x27;s poems depict the urban landscape of the area. Former Green Party leader Eamon Ryan was born in Dundrum. The Christian Scientist Violet Spiller Hay (1873–1969) was born here. Choreographer Liz Roche is also from Dundrum.

==Sport==
Tour de France Winner, cyclist Stephen Roche is from Dundrum, as is his son Nicolas Roche (although Nicolas was actually born in France).

Dundrum is home to athletics club Dundrum Athletic, and football side Dundrum Athletic F.C.

The local GAA club is Naomh Olaf

<doc id="1079304" wikidata="Q727643" url="?curid=1079304" title="Paul Nash (artist)">
<text>Paul Nash (11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946) was a British surrealist painter and war artist, as well as a photographer, writer and designer of applied art. Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century. He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art.

Born in London, Nash grew up in Buckinghamshire where he developed a love of the landscape. He entered the Slade School of Art but was poor at figure drawing and concentrated on landscape painting. Nash found much inspiration in landscapes with elements of ancient history, such as burial mounds, Iron Age hill forts such as Wittenham Clumps and the standing stones at Avebury in Wiltshire. The artworks he produced during World War I are among the most iconic images of the conflict. After the war Nash continued to focus on landscape painting, originally in a formalized, decorative style but, throughout the 1930s, in an increasingly abstract and surreal manner. In his paintings he often placed everyday objects into a landscape to give them a new identity and symbolism.

During World War II, although sick with the asthmatic condition that would kill him, he produced two series of anthropomorphic depictions of aircraft, before producing a number of landscapes rich in symbolism with an intense mystical quality. These have perhaps become among the best known works from the period. Nash was also a fine book illustrator, and also designed stage scenery, fabrics and posters.

He was the older brother of the artist John Nash.

==Early life==
Nash was the son of a successful barrister, William Harry Nash, and his wife Caroline Maude, the daughter of a Captain in the Royal Navy. He was born in Kensington and grew up in Earl&#x27;s Court in West London, but in 1902 the family moved to Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire. It was hoped the move to the countryside would help Caroline Nash, who was increasingly showing symptoms of mental illness. The growing cost of Caroline Nash&#x27;s treatment led to the house at Iver Heath being rented out while Paul and his father lived together in lodgings and his younger sister and brother went to boarding schools. On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1910, aged forty-nine, Caroline Nash died in a mental institution. Paul Nash was originally intended for a career in the navy, following the path of his maternal grandfather, but despite additional training at a specialist school in Greenwich, he failed the Naval Entrance Examination and returned to finish his schooling at St Paul&#x27;s School. Encouraged by a fellow student at St Paul&#x27;s, Eric Kennington, Nash considered the possibility of a career as an artist. After studying for a year at the South-Western Polytechnic in Chelsea, he then enrolled at the London County Council School of Photo-engraving and Lithography, in Bolt Court off Fleet Street, in the autumn of 1908. Nash spent two years studying at Bolt Court, where he began to write poetry and plays and where his work was spotted and praised by Selwyn Image. He was advised by his friend, the poet Gordon Bottomley, and by the artist William Rothenstein, that he should attend the Slade School of Art at University College, London. He enrolled in October 1910, though he later recorded that on his first meeting with the Professor of Drawing, Henry Tonks, &#x27;It was evident he considered that neither the Slade, nor I, were likely to derive much benefit&#x27;.

The Slade was then opening its doors to a remarkable crop of young talents – what Tonks later described as the school&#x27;s second and last &#x27;Crisis of Brilliance&#x27;. Nash&#x27;s fellow students included Ben Nicholson, Stanley Spencer, Mark Gertler, William Roberts, Dora Carrington, C. R. W. Nevinson and Edward Wadsworth. Nash struggled with figure drawing, and spent only a year at the school. Nash had shows in 1912 and 1913, sometimes with his brother John, largely devoted to drawings and watercolours of brooding landscapes, influenced by the poetry of William Blake and the paintings of Samuel Palmer and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Two locations in particular featured in his landscape work at this time, the view from his father&#x27;s house in Iver Heath and a pair of tree-topped hills in the Thames Valley known as the Wittenham Clumps. These were the first in a series of locations, which would eventually include Ypres, Dymchurch, the Romney Marshes, Avebury and Swanage, that would inspire Nash in his landscape paintings throughout his life. By the summer of 1914 Nash was enjoying some success and during that year he worked briefly at the Omega Workshops under Roger Fry and also worked with him on restoring the Mantegna cartoons at Hampton Court Palace.
He was elected to The London Group in 1914.

==World War I==

===Army officer===

On 10 September 1914, shortly after the start of World War I, Nash reluctantly enlisted as a Private for home service in the Second Battalion, the Artists&#x27; Rifles, part of the 28th London Regiment of the Territorial Army. Nash&#x27;s duties, which included guard duty at the Tower of London, allowed him time to continue drawing and painting. 

In December 1914 Nash married Jerusalem-born Margaret Theodosia Odeh, an Oxford-educated campaigner for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square. Her father, Revd Naser Odeh who was born in Palestine and educated at Monkton Combe School, had been the founding priest in charge of St Mary&#x27;s Mission and the pro-cathedral, Cairo. Margaret was naturalised British in 1912. The couple had no children. 

Nash began officer training in August 1916 and was sent to the Western Front in February 1917 as a second lieutenant in the Hampshire Regiment. He was based at St. Eloi on the Ypres Salient at a relatively quiet time and although the area did come under shelling, no major engagements took place while he was there. Whilst clearly aware of the destruction that had taken place there, he was delighted to see that, with spring arriving, the landscape was recovering from the damage inflicted on it. However, on the night of 25 May 1917, Nash fell into a trench, broke a rib and, by 1 June, had been invalided back to London. A few days later the majority of his former unit were killed in an assault on a position known as Hill 60. Nash considered himself lucky to be alive. While recuperating in London, Nash worked from sketches he had done at the Front to produce a series of twenty drawings, mostly in ink, chalk and watercolours, of the war. Whilst some of these pieces showed the influence of the Vorticist movement and their manifesto, the literary magazine &quot;BLAST&quot;, the majority concerned the spring landscape and were similar in tone to his pre-war work. &quot;Chaos Decoratif&quot;, for example, shows part of a trench and a shattered tree amid a scene of almost pastoral calm. The collection was well received when exhibited in June that year at the Goupil Gallery. A further exhibition of these drawings was held in Birmingham in September 1917. As a result of these exhibitions, C. R. W. Nevinson advised Nash to approach Charles Masterman, head of the government&#x27;s War Propaganda Bureau, to apply to become an official war artist. Nash was with a reserve battalion near Portsmouth, preparing to return to France in a combat role, when he received word that his commission as a war artist had been approved.

===Official war artist – Belgium, 1917===
In November 1917 Nash returned to the Ypres Salient as a uniformed observer with a batman and chauffeur. At this point the Third Battle of Ypres was three months old and Nash himself frequently came under shellfire after arriving in Flanders. The winter landscape he found was very different from the one he had last seen in spring. The system of ditches, small canals and dykes which usually drained the Ypres landscape had been all but destroyed by the constant shellfire. Months of incessant rain had led to widespread flooding and mile upon mile of deep mud. Nash was outraged at this desecration of nature. He believed the landscape was no longer capable of supporting life nor could it recover when spring came. Nash quickly grew angry and disillusioned with the war and made this clear in letters written to his wife. One such written, after a pointless meeting at Brigade HQ, on 16 November 1917 stands out,

Nash&#x27;s anger was a great creative stimulus which led him to produce up to a dozen drawings a day. He worked in a frenzy of activity and took great risks to get as close as possible to the frontline trenches. Despite the dangers and hardship, when the opportunity came to extend his visit by a week and work for the Canadians in the Vimy sector, Nash jumped at the chance. He eventually returned to England on 7 December 1917.

===Official war artist – England, 1918===
In six weeks on the Western Front, Nash completed what he called &quot;fifty drawings of muddy places&quot;. When he returned to England, he started to develop these drawings into finished pieces and began working flat-out to have enough pictures ready for a one-man show in May 1918. While in Flanders Nash had mostly worked in pen-and-ink, often over painted in watercolours, but in England he learnt, from Nevinson, to produce lithographs. The 1917 drawing &quot;Nightfall, Zillebecke District&quot; showing soldiers walking along a zig-zagging duckboard became the 1918 lithograph &quot;Rain&quot;. &quot;After the Battle&quot; shows a battlefield, deserted save for some corpses sinking into the mud. &quot;The Landscape – Hill 60&quot; shows fields of mud and shellholes with explosions filling the sky above. One of the largest and most powerful new drawings was &quot;Wire&quot;, originally titled &quot;Wire-The Hindenburg Line&quot; and again uses the destruction of nature, in the form of a tree trunk wrapped in barbed wire, akin to a crown of thorns, to represent the catastrophe of war.

Early in 1918, Nash began working in oils for the first time. The first oil painting he made was &quot;The Mule Track&quot; in which, amidst explosions from a bombardment, are the tiny figures of soldiers trying to stop their pack animals charging away along another zig-zagging duckboard. Switching to oils allowed Nash to make far greater use of colour and the explosions in &quot;The Mule Track&quot; contain yellow, orange and mustard shades. The canvas &quot;The Ypres Salient at Night&quot; captures the disorientation caused by the changes in direction of the defensive trenches at the Front, which Nash would have been familiar with, and which was exacerbated at night by the constant explosion of shells and flares.

Whilst in France Nash had made a pen-and-ink drawing he called &quot;Sunrise, Inverness Copse&quot;. Inverness Copse was the site of heavy fighting in the summer of 1917 during the Battle of Langemarck, part of the Third Battle of Ypres and Nash depicts the aftermath of the fighting, showing a landscape consisting of mud and blasted trees illuminated by a pale yellow Sun. Early in 1918, when Nash decided to produce a larger oil painting based on this drawing, whatever little hope that pale Sun represented had vanished. The bitter title, &quot;We are Making a New World&quot;, clearly mocks the ambitions of the war but is also a more universal reference than the previous title and represents a scene of devastation that could be anywhere on the Western Front. There are no people in the picture nor any of the details of, for example, &quot;The Mule Track&quot; to distract from the broken tree stumps, shellholes and mounds of earth. The Sun is a cold white orb and the brown clouds of the original drawing have become blood red. One modern critic, writing in 1994, likened it to a &#x27;nuclear winter&#x27; whilst one of the first people to see it in 1918, Arthur Lee, the official censor responsible for the British war artists, thought it was a &#x27;joke&#x27; at the expense of the public and the art establishment.


These new works, alongside the 1917 pieces and some other works such as &quot;Mackerel Sky&quot;, were exhibited in Nash&#x27;s solo exhibition entitled &quot;The Void of War&quot; at the Leicester Galleries in May 1918. This exhibition was critically acclaimed with most commentators focusing on how Nash had portrayed nature, in the form of devastated woods, fields and hillsides, as the innocent victim of the war.
===&quot;The Menin Road&quot;===
In April 1918 Nash was commissioned by the British War Memorials Committee to paint a battlefield scene for the Hall of Remembrance project. He chose to depict a section of the Ypres Salient known as &#x27;Tower Hamlets&#x27; that had been devastated during the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge. Once his work for the &quot;Void of War&quot; exhibition was complete in June 1918, Nash started painting the huge canvas, now known as &quot;The Menin Road&quot;, which was almost in size, at Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire using a herb-drying shed as his studio. He completed the piece in February 1919 in London. The picture depicts a maze of flooded trenches and shell craters while tree stumps, devoid of any foliage, point towards a sky full of clouds and plumes of smoke bisected by shafts of sunlight resembling gun barrels. Two soldiers at the centre of the picture attempt to follow the now unrecognisable road itself but appear to be trapped by the landscape.

== 1920s ==
When the war ended Nash was determined to continue his career as an artist but struggled with periodic bouts of depression and money worries. Throughout 1919 and 1920 Nash lived in Buckinghamshire and in London where he made theatre designs for a play by J. M. Barrie. Along with several other artists, Nash became prominent in the Society of Wood Engravers and in 1920 was involved in its first exhibition. From 1920 until 1923 Nash taught, on an occasional basis, at the Cornmarket School of Art in Oxford.

===Dymchurch and Iden===
In 1921, after visiting his sick father, Nash collapsed and, after a week during which he repeatedly lost consciousness, was diagnosed as suffering from &#x27;emotional shock&#x27; arising from the war. To aid his recovery, the Nashes moved to Dymchurch which they had first visited in 1919 and where he painted seascapes, the seawall and landscapes of Romney Marsh. The seawall at Dymchurch became a key location in Nash&#x27;s work. The conflict between land and sea depicted in the seawall paintings at Dymchurch recalled elements of Nash&#x27;s paintings on the Western Front and were also influenced by his grief at the death of his friend Claud Lovat Fraser in June 1921. In 1922, Nash produced &quot;Places&quot;, a volume of seven wood engravings for which he also designed the cover, cut the lettering and wrote the text. At this time he also began painting floral still-lifes as well as continuing his landscape paintings, most notably with &quot;Chilterns under Snow&quot; in 1923. Throughout 1924 and 1925 Nash taught part-time at the Design School at the Royal College of Art, where his students included both Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden. In 1924 he held a commercially successful exhibition at the Leicester Galleries. This allowed the Nashes to spend the winter near Nice and visit Florence and Pisa at the start of 1925 after which they moved home to Iden near Rye in Sussex. Iden and the Romney Marshes became the settings for a series of paintings by Nash, most notably &quot;Winter Sea&quot; painted in 1925 and reworked in 1937. In 1927 Nash was elected to the London Artists&#x27; Association and in 1928 held another successful exhibition of his paintings at the Leicester Galleries whilst an exhibition of his wood-engravings was held at the Redfern Gallery the same year. The Leicester Galleries exhibition was notable for showing Nash turning away from his popular landscapes and beginning to explore abstraction in his work.

This change in direction continued throughout 1929 and 1930 when Nash produced a number of innovative paintings,
*&quot;Landscape at Iden&quot;, with its seemingly unrelated objects placed beside each other amid strong architectural elements, showed the impression the 1928 London exhibition by the surrealist Giorgio de Chirico had made on Nash.
*&quot;Northern Adventure&quot; and &quot;Nostalgic Landscape, St Pancras Station&quot; both paintings of St Pancras Station seen through a lattice work of abstract elements, derived from the frame of an advertising hoarding.
* The paintings &quot;Coronilla&quot; (1929) and &quot;Opening&quot; (1931) both depict openings between spaces in an abstract and cubist manner through which trees or the sea can be seen. The earlier &quot;Lares&quot; is in a similar style.
* Nash completed &quot;Dead Spring&quot; in February 1929, immediately after the death of his father. The painting shows a dying pot plant on a window still surrounded by a lattice of geometrical shapes which include some draughtsman&#x27;s tools. Like the painting &quot;Lares&quot;, &quot;Dead Spring&quot; is thought to show the influence on Nash of having seen the 1928 Giorgio de Chirico exhibition in London.

===Other media===

Nash often worked in media other than paint. As well as two volumes of his own wood engravings, &quot;Places&quot; and &quot;Genesis&quot;, throughout the 1920s Nash produced highly regarded book illustrations for several authors, including Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon. Nash was one of the contributors of illustrations to the Subscriber&#x27;s Edition of T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, published in 1926. In 1930, Nash produced the dust jacket design for &quot;Roads to Glory&quot;, a collection of World War I stories by Richard Aldington.

In 1921 Nash displayed textile designs at an exhibition at Heal&#x27;s and in 1925 developed four fabric designs for the &quot;Footprints&quot; series sold by Modern Textiles in London. Later still, in 1933, Brain &amp; Co in Stoke-on-Trent commissioned Nash and other artists to produce designs for their Foley China range which was showcased at the &quot;Modern Art for the Table&quot; exhibition at Harrods. In 1931, Margaret Nash gave him a camera when he sailed to America to serve as a jury member at the Carnegie International Award in Pittsburgh. Nash became a prolific photographer and would often work from his own photographs alongside his preparatory sketches when painting a work.

By April 1928, Nash wanted to leave Iden but did not do so until after his father&#x27;s death in February 1929, when he sold the family home in Iver Heath and bought a house in Rye.

== 1930s ==

In 1930 Nash started working as an art critic for &quot;The Listener&quot;, and in his writings acknowledged the influence of the 1928 Giorgio de Chirico London exhibition and of the modernist works he had seen during a visit to Paris in 1930 at Léonce Rosenberg&#x27;s gallery. Nash became a pioneer of modernism in Britain, promoting the avant-garde European styles of abstraction and surrealism throughout the 1930s. In 1933 he co-founded the influential modern art movement Unit One with fellow artists Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson, Edward Wadsworth and the critic Herbert Read. It was a short-lived but important move towards the revitalisation of British art in the inter-war period.

===Avebury===
When in 1931 he was invited to illustrate a book of his own choice, Nash choose Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial&quot; and &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot;, providing the publisher with a set of 30 illustrations to accompany Browne&#x27;s discourses.
For &quot;Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial&quot; Nash also produced six larger watercolours, including &quot;Mansions of the Dead&quot;, and three oil paintings on the book&#x27;s themes of death and burial customs. These became significant themes for Nash when in July 1933 he went to Marlborough on holiday and visited Silbury Hill and Avebury for the first time. This ancient landscape with its neolithic monuments and standing stones &quot;excited and fascinated&quot; Nash and stirred &quot;his sensitiveness to magic and the sinister beauty of monsters&quot; according to Ruth Clarke who had accompanied him to Marlborough. Nash went on to paint the landscape at Avebury several times in different styles, most notably in his two 1934 paintings, &quot;Druid Landscape&quot; and &quot;Landscape of the Megaliths&quot;. The 1935 painting &quot;Equivalents for the Megaliths&quot; stresses the mystery of the site by portraying it in an abstract manner rather than a more literal depiction. Nash appears to have been unhappy with the restoration work, started in 1934, at Avebury by Alexander Keiller, seemingly preferring the previous wilder and more unkept appearance of the area.

Nash&#x27;s father in law Naser Odeh died in Rye in 1932 and Nash was named an executor, together with his wife Margaret. Nash wanted to move to live in Wiltshire but instead he left Rye for London in November 1933 before the couple undertook a long trip to France, Gibraltar and North Africa. When they returned to England in June 1934, the Nashes rented a cottage on the Dorset coast near Swanage. Nash was asked by the poet John Betjeman to write a book in the Shell Guides series. Nash accepted and undertook writing a guide to Dorset.

===Swanage===
Between 1934 and 1936 Nash lived near Swanage in Dorset, hoping the sea air would ease his asthma whilst he worked on the &quot;Shell Guide to Dorset&quot;. 
He produced a considerable number of paintings and photographs during this period, some of which he used in the guide book. The guide was published in 1935 and featured some peculiarities of landscape and architecture that are often overlooked. Nash found Swanage with its diverse flora and fauna, fossils and geology to have certain Surrealist qualities. In a 1936 essay, entitled &quot;Swanage or Seaside Surrealism&quot;, he wrote that the place had something &quot;of a dream image where things are so often incongruous and slightly frightening in their relation to time or place.&quot; Whilst there Nash met the artist Eileen Agar. The two began a relationship, which lasted some years, and also collaborated on a number of works together. In Swanage, Nash produced some notable surrealist works such as &quot;Events on the Downs&quot;, a picture of a giant tennis ball and a tree trunk seemingly embarking on a journey together and, later, &quot;Landscape from a Dream&quot;, a cliff-top scene with a hawk and mirror. For a collage of black and white photographs entitled &quot;Swanage&quot;, Nash depicts objects found in, or connected to, locations around Dorset within a surrealist landscape. On Romany Marsh Nash found his first surrealist object, or Objet trouvé. This piece of wood retrieved from a stream was likened by Nash to a fine Henry Moore sculpture and was shown at the first International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936 under the title &quot;Marsh Personage&quot;.

By the time of the exhibition Nash had come to dislike Swanage and in mid-1936 moved to a large house in Hampstead. Here he wrote articles on &quot;seaside surrealism&quot;, created collages and assemblages, began his autobiography and organised a large one-man show at the Redfern Gallery in April 1937. That summer he visited the site of the Uffington White Horse in Berkshire and shortly afterwards began work on &quot;Landscape from a Dream&quot;. In 1939, shortly after World War II began, the Nashes left Hampstead and moved to Oxford.

== World War Two ==

At the start of World War Two Nash was appointed by the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee to a full-time salaried war artist post attached to the Royal Air Force and the Air Ministry. Nash was unpopular with the Air Ministry representative on the WAAC committee, partly because of the modernist nature of his work and partly because the RAF wanted the WAAC artists to concentrate on producing portraits of their pilots and aircrew. Whilst still a salaried WAAC artist Nash produced two series of watercolours, &quot;Raiders&quot; and &quot;Aerial Creatures&quot;. &quot;Raiders&quot;, or &quot;Marching Against England&quot;, was a set of studies of crashed German aircraft set in English rural landscapes with titles such as &quot;Bomber in the Corn&quot;, &quot;The Messerschmidt in Windsor Great Park&quot; and &quot;Under the Cliff&quot;. Whilst the Air Ministry could appreciate the patriotic intent and propaganda value of those works, the &quot;Aerial Creatures&quot; series, with its anthropomorphic depictions of British aircraft, displeased the Air Ministry so much they insisted Nash&#x27;s full-time contract was ended in December 1940. The Chairman of WAAC, Kenneth Clark was aghast at this development and in January 1941 the Committee agreed to put aside £500 to purchase works from Nash on the theme of aerial conflict. Nash worked intermittently under this arrangement until 1944 to produce four paintings for WAAC. The first two of these were &quot;Totes Meer (Dead Sea)&quot; and &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;.

&quot;Totes Meer (Dead Sea)&quot; was submitted to WAAC in 1941 and shows a &#x27;dead sea&#x27; of wrecked German plane wings and fuselages based on sketches, and photographs, made at the Metal and Produce Recovery Unit at Cowley near Oxford in 1940. The painting recalls a series of bleak sea and coastal paintings Nash made in the 1930s. Although the aircraft dump at Cowley contained many British planes, Nash only depicted German aircraft because he wished to show the fate of the &#x27;hundreds and hundreds of flying creatures which invaded these shores&#x27;. He used the German title for the picture as he wanted it included in a series of postcards of crashed German planes he suggested be dropped over the Reich as propaganda. To this end Nash even created a postcard of the painting with Hitler&#x27;s head superimposed on the wrecked aircraft. Kenneth Clark stated that &quot;Totes Meer&quot; was &#x27;the best war picture so far I think&#x27; and is still considered among the most celebrated British paintings of World War II.

&quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1941) is an imaginative representation of an aerial battle in progress over a wide landscape of land and sea, suggesting the Thames Estuary and the English Channel. The white vapour trails of the Allied aircraft form patterns resembling buds and petals and appear to be growing naturally from the land and clouds, in contrast to the rigid, formal ranks of the attacking forces. Clark recognised the allegorical nature of the work and wrote to Nash, &quot;I think in this and &quot;Totes Meer&quot; you have discovered a new form of allegorical painting. It is impossible to paint great events without allegory... and you have discovered a way of making the symbols out of the events themselves.&quot;

After completing &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, Nash found himself creatively blocked and again sick with asthma. Whilst unable to paint he did produce a number of photographic collages which included symbols and motifs from previous works often alongside images of Hitler. Nash submitted a series of these pieces, entitled &quot;Follow the Fuehrer&quot;, to the Ministry of Information for use as propaganda but they declined to use them. When he did resume painting, Nash produced &quot;Defence of Albion&quot;, which is considered the weakest of his four large WAAC paintings. Nash had great difficulties completing the painting which shows a Short Sunderland flying boat in the sea off Portland Bill. As he had only seen photographs of Sunderlands, and was too ill to go to the coast to view one, Nash wrote to Eric Ravilious, who had painted flying boats in Scotland, asking him to describe the effect of sunlight on the plane.
Nash&#x27;s final painting for WAAC was however an extraordinary, imagined scene of a bombing raid on a city. Despite being given access to official reports and accounts from aircrews who had flown on raids to Germany, for the &quot;Battle of Germany&quot;, Nash adopted an unconventional abstract approach. Nash explained that it showed a city under attack with a pillar of smoke from burning buildings in the background and the white spheres of descending parachutes in the foreground. The pillar of smoke and the moon were as threatening to the city as the bombers, concealed within the red clouds, responsible for the explosions on the right side of the painting. Whilst Kenneth Clark found the painting difficult to understand because of what he called the &quot;different planes of reality in which it is painted&quot;, he did recognize that it might herald one course that post-war art could take.

==Final works==
From 1942 onwards, Nash often visited the artist Hilda Harrisson at her home, Sandlands on Boars Hill near Oxford, to convalesce after bouts of illness. From the garden at Sandlands, Nash had a view of the Wittenham Clumps, which he had first visited as a child and had painted both before World War I and again, as a background, in 1934 and 1935. He now painted a series of imaginative works of the Clumps under different aspects of the Moon. Paintings such as &quot;Landscape of the Vernal Equinox&quot; (1943) and &quot;Landscape of the Moon&#x27;s Last Phase&quot; (1944) show a mystical landscape rich in the symbolism of the changing seasons and of death and rebirth. Another place in South Oxfordshire that Nash visited and revisited and found inspirational in his study of the Moon was the hamlet of Ascott. There he began in 1932 and completed in 1942 his painting &quot;Pillar and Moon&quot;, which explored &quot;the mystical association of two objects which inhabit different elements and have no apparent relation in life...the pale stone sphere on top of a ruined pillar faces its counterpart the moon, cold and pale and solid as stone&quot;.


The completion of &quot;Battle of Germany&quot; in September 1944 brought Nash&#x27;s public commitments to an end and he spent the remaining eighteen months of his life in, by his own words, &quot;reclusive melancholy&quot;. In these final months, Nash produced a series of paintings, including &quot;Flight of the Magnolia&quot; (1944), which he called &#x27;Aerial Flowers&#x27; that combined his fascination with flying and his love of the works of Samuel Palmer. Nash also returned to the influence of William Blake that had so affected his early art, for example in the series of gigantic sunflowers including &quot;Sunflower and Sun&quot; (1942), &quot;Solstice of the Sunflower&quot; (1945) and &quot;Eclipse of the Sunflower&quot; (1945), based on Blake&#x27;s 1794 poem &quot;Ah! Sun-flower&quot;.

==Death==
During the final ten days of his life Nash returned to Dorset and visited Swanage, Corfe, Worth Matravers and Kimmeridge Bay. Nash died in his sleep of heart failure, as a result of his long-term asthma, on 11 July 1946, at Boscombe in Hampshire (now Dorset) and was buried on 17 July, in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Langley in Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire). The Egyptian stone carving of a hawk, that Nash had painted in &quot;Landscape from a Dream&quot;, was placed on his grave. A memorial exhibition and concert for Nash, attended by the then Queen Elizabeth, was held at the Tate Gallery in March 1948. His widow Margaret died in 1960 and the couple are buried together in Langley.

<doc id="1079319" wikidata="Q370729" url="?curid=1079319" title="John Carlos">
<text>John Wesley Carlos (born June 5, 1945) is an American former track and field athlete and professional football player. He was the bronze-medal winner in the 200 meters at the 1968 Summer Olympics, where he displayed the Black Power salute on the podium with Tommie Smith. He went on to tie the world record in the 100-yard dash and beat the 200 meters world record (although the latter achievement was never certified). After his track career, he enjoyed a brief stint in the Canadian Football League but retired due to injury.

He became involved with the United States Olympic Committee and helped to organize the 1984 Summer Olympics. Following this, he became a track coach at Palm Springs High School. He was inducted into the USA Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame in 2003.

He is the author, with sportswriter Dave Zirin, of &quot;The John Carlos Story: The Sports Moment That Changed the World&quot;, published in 2011 by Haymarket Books.

==Early life and education==
Born in The Bronx, Carlos was raised in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. His mother, Violis (née Lawrence, 1919–2016), was born in Jamaica to Black Cuban parents and grew up in Santiago, Cuba. His father, Earl V. Carlos Sr. (1895–1969), was from South Carolina. Carlos participated in a 200-meter dash and as a member of the 4×400-meter relay helped lead ETSU to the 1967 Lone Star Conference Championship. After his first year, Carlos enrolled at San Jose State University where he was trained by future National Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame coach Lloyd (Bud) Winter.

Carlos was awarded an honorary doctorate from California State University in 2008. In 2012, he was awarded honorary doctorates from his alma maters Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce (formerly East Texas State University) and San Jose State University.

==Olympics==
The 1968 Olympic Trials were held on the Californian side of Lake Tahoe at Echo Summit trailhead, which at 7,377 feet above sea level is approximately the same altitude as Mexico City. Carlos won the 200-meter dash in 19.92 seconds, beating world-record holder Tommie Smith and surpassing his record by 3 seconds. Though the record was never ratified because the spike formation on Carlos&#x27;s shoes (&quot;brush spikes&quot;) was not accepted at the time, the race reinforced his status as a world-class sprinter.

Carlos became a founding member of the Olympic Project for Human Rights (OPHR), and originally advocated a boycott of the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games unless four conditions were met: withdrawal of South Africa and Rhodesia from the games, restoration of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s world heavyweight boxing title, Avery Brundage to step down as president of the IOC, and the hiring of more African-American assistant coaches. As the boycott failed to achieve support after the IOC withdrew invitations for South Africa and Rhodesia, he decided, together with Smith, to participate but to stage a protest in case he received a medal. Following his first-place finish behind fellow American Smith and Australian Peter Norman in the 200 meters at the Mexico Olympics, Carlos and Smith made headlines around the world by raising their black-gloved fists at the medal award ceremony. Both athletes wore black socks and no shoes on the podium to represent African-American poverty in the United States. In support, Peter Norman, the silver medalist who was a white athlete from Australia, participated in the protest by wearing an OPHR badge.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Avery Brundage deemed it to be a domestic political statement unfit for the supposedly apolitical, international forum the Olympic Games were claimed to be. In response to their actions, he ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games.

A spokesman for the IOC called Smith and Carlos&#x27;s actions &quot;a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit.&quot; Brundage, who was president of the United States Olympic Committee in 1936, had made no objections against Nazi salutes during the Berlin Olympics. He argued that the Nazi salute, being a national salute at the time, was acceptable in a competition of nations, while the athletes&#x27; salute was not of a nation and therefore unacceptable.

Carlos had his greatest year in track and field in 1969, equaling the world 100-yard record of 9.1, winning the AAU 220-yard run, and leading San Jose State to its first NCAA championship with victories in the 100 and 220 and as a member of the 4×110-yard relay. He was featured on the cover of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;&#x27; May 1969 issue.

He was also the gold medalist at 200 meters at the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and set indoor world bests in the 60-yard dash (5.9) and the indoor 220-yard dash (21.2).

The 1968 Olympics were in the middle of several significant events pertaining to the Civil Rights movement: Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, the Fair Housing Act law was passed on April 11, 1968, and the 1968 Olympics were in October 1968. At this time, countless protests around the country in response to the Vietnam War and US laws on individual human rights being actively fought for. The 1968 Olympics were broadcast nationally and internationally through television and radio, giving athletes a platform to share their thoughts on issues around the world in front of a large audience of people. The international press the games were given was a tool used in international relations during the cold war. Acts of peaceful protest by popular athletes in sports is something that is still very prevalent in today&#x27;s society.

==Career==
Following his track career, Carlos, a 15th-round selection in the 1970 NFL draft, tried professional football, but a knee injury curtailed his tryout with the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. He then went on to the Canadian Football League where he played one season for the Montreal Alouettes. Following his retirement from football, Carlos worked for Puma, the United States Olympic Committee, the Organising Committee of the 1984 Summer Olympics and the City of Los Angeles.

In 1985, Carlos became a counselor and in-school suspension supervisor, as well as the track and field coach, at Palm Springs High School in California. In 2003, he was elected to the National Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame.
In 2005, a statue titled &quot;Victory Salute&quot; showing Carlos and Smith on the medal stand was constructed by political artist Rigo 23 and dedicated on the campus of San Jose State University.

In 2006, John Carlos delivered a eulogy at Peter Norman&#x27;s funeral and was also a pallbearer at the ceremony, as was Tommie Smith.

In 2007, John Carlos was honored at the Trumpet Awards in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Carlos is the godfather of Chicago White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams. Carlos ran track with Williams&#x27;s father in college.

In April 2008, Carlos was a torch-bearer for the Human Rights Torch, which ran in parallel to the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and focusing attention on China&#x27;s human rights record.

On July 16, 2008, John Carlos and Tommie Smith accepted the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage for their salute, at the 2008 ESPY Awards held at NOKIA Theatre L.A. LIVE in Los Angeles, California.

On October 10, 2011, Carlos spoke and raised his fist at Occupy Wall Street. He said: &quot;Today I am here for you. Why? Because I am you. We&#x27;re here forty-three years later because there&#x27;s a fight still to be won. This day is not for us but for our children to come.&quot; The following day he appeared on MSNBC and on Current TV&#x27;s &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;.

<doc id="1079323" wikidata="Q341777" url="?curid=1079323" title="Čáslav">
<text>Čáslav (; ) is a town in Kutná Hora District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 11,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Čáslav consists of three municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Čáslav-Nové Město (9,078)
*Čáslav-Staré Město (894)
*Filipov (182)

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the personal name Čáslav.

==Geography==
Čáslav is located about southeast of Kutná Hora and southwest of Pardubice. It lies in a flat agricultural landscape of the Central Elbe Table. The Brslenka Stream flows through the town and supplies several ponds, including Podměstský in the town centre. The Klejnárka River crosses the western part of the municipal territory.

==History==

The history of Čáslav begins in the 9th century with the founding of a gord and settlement called Hrádek. In the 11th century, it became a Přemyslid administrative centre. A new royal town with a huge square was founded by King Ottokar II of Bohemia next to Hrádek in around 1250. In 1421, Bohemian parliament debated in Čáslav and voted in a new Hussite government.

Two large fires in 1452 and 1522 severely damaged the town. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in 1639 and 1642, Čáslav was devastated and burnt down by Swedish troops. The town however recovered and in 1715, Čáslav became the centre of a region.

===Jewish population===
From the 14th century there was a Jewish settlement in Čáslav, but in the 15th century the Jews were expelled. In the middle of the 19th century, only one Jewish family lived in the town. After the equality of the Jews in 1867, many from the area moved to the town of Čáslav. Around 1893, 245 Jews lived in the town, which was about 1–2% of the population.

==Demographics==
==Air base==

To the northeast of the town, there is an active air base of the Czech Air Force, called the 21st Tactical Air Force Base. This base is responsible for protecting the airspace of the Czech Republic.

==Transport==
Čáslav is located on the interregional railway line Prague–Žďár nad Sázavou. It is also the starting point of a line of local importance to Třemošnice.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s football club, FK Čáslav, plays in the lower amateur tiers. The club was founded in 1902 as SK STELLA (Hvězda) Čáslav. In 2006–2013, the club played in the Czech National Football League.

Notable is the Athletics Club Čáslav. Two of its most known sportswomen are Ludmila Formanová and Jarmila Kratochvílová, both World champions in 800 m sprint.

==Sights==

The Church of Saints Peter and Paul is an early Gothic building from the end of the 13th century. The building included the Romanesque Church of St. Michael from the 11th century (today&#x27;s sacristy), which originally stood here.

The town area was delimited by walls, which are preserved in one third of their original length. A unique monument of the Čáslav Gothic fortifications is the cylindrical Otakar&#x27;s Tower, which stood at the Brod Gate.

Čáslav Town Museum, one of the oldest regional museums in Bohemia, was founded in 1864. Its building is from 1884.

The synagogue was built between 1899 and 1900 in Moorish style, designed by architect Wilhelm Stiassny. It was used until 1939 by the local Jewish community, which was then almost totally wiped out during the Holocaust. After World War II the abandoned building saw use as a warehouse, and then (between 1970–1989) as a gallery. In 1994, however, it was returned to the Jewish Community in Prague and has recently been restored.

In 1910, part of the skull of the Hussite general Jan Žižka was discovered in Čáslav parish church. The skull is exhibited in Žižka&#x27;s Hall of Čáslav Town Hall.

<text>The Jeszenszky family or Jesenský (also &quot;Jessensky&quot;, &quot;Jessinsky&quot;, &quot;Jessensky de Gross Jessen&quot;) is the name of two old noble families in the Kingdom of Hungary. They have a mutual name but their origins are different.

==Kisjeszen family==

The first known ancestor of the &quot;Kisjeszen&quot; (Minor Jeszen) family was the castle warrior &quot;András Temérdek&quot; who received lands in Turóc County () from king Béla IV of Hungary in 1255. The family introduced their new surname after the name of a village &quot;Jeszen&quot; (Jaseno, now Turčianske Jaseno). In the 14th century the family used the &quot;Kisjeszeni&quot; (&quot;de Kisjeszen&quot;) name form and the Slovak variant of their name &quot;Jeszenszky&quot; came into use from the 15th century.

==Nagyjeszen family==
The first known member of the &quot;Nagyjeszen&quot; (Major Jeszen) family was called &quot;Mágya&quot;. In 1278 Mágya received his noble title, because of his valor in the Battle on the Marchfeld.

==Famous members of the families==
Ladislaus Jesenský died in 1526 during the catastrophic Battle of Mohács. Subsequently, all Jesenský property was confiscated by the advancing Ottomans, so brothers Melchior, Lorenz and Balthasar Jesenský moved to Silesia (then part of the Crown of Bohemia) and lived in Wrocław and Świdnica from 1541 onward. Balthasar&#x27;s son was Ján Jesenský, known as Jan Jesenius, famous scientist and politician who lived and died in Prague, Bohemia.

Branches of the families are still living in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, United States and England. 

Important family members:
* Jan Jesenius (1566–1621), Bohemian physician, philosopher and politician, rector of Charles University in Prague
* Růžena Jesenská (1863–1940), Czech novelist
* Jan Jesenský (1870–1947), Czech scientist, professor of Charles University
* Janko Jesenský (1874–1945), Slovak poet, prose writer and translator
* Milena Jesenská (1896–1944), Czech journalist and translator, friend of Franz Kafka
* Jan Jesenský Jr. (1904–1942), Czech scientist, assistant professor of Charles University
* Ferenc Jeszenszky (1905–1990), Hungarian economist, during 1949–52 was a president of Hungarian National Bank in Budapest
* Géza Jeszenszky (1941–), Hungarian politician, in 1990–94 foreign minister of Hungary

<text>West Otago is the local name given to part of the region of Otago, New Zealand, lying close to the border with Southland. It is administratively connected to South Otago, but is geographically separated from it by a range of hills known as the Blue Mountains. The largest settlements in West Otago are Tapanui and Heriot, and other localities within the area include Moa Flat, Edievale, Crookston, Merino Downs, and Waikoikoi. The area described as West Otago is sometimes extended to include Lawrence, Clinton, and Beaumont. The ghost town of Kelso also lies within West Otago. Other notable features of the area include Conical Hill and Landslip Hill, the latter being a major fossil-bearing formation.

West Otago is connected to the New Zealand State Highway network by , which runs north–south through the Pomahaka valley linking near Gore and at Raes Junction. The area was formerly also served by a rail branch line, the Tapanui Branch, which ran from 1880 until 1978.

European settlement in the area dates back to the 1850s. Early settlers in the region included William Pinkerton, an Englishman who had been a runholder in Australia for over a decade, who first cleared land for farming around Tapanui in 1857. A Scottish settler, Adam Oliver, and his wife Agnes, had settled further down the Pomahaka valley the previous year. Prior to European arrival, the area was a Māori moa-hunting area, but had little if any permanent settlement.

West Otago consists of rolling farmland and forested hills close to the Pomahaka River. Livestock farming (sheep and cattle) is a major industry in the area, and Tapanui is historically a forestry centre.

==Demographics==

<doc id="1079341" wikidata="Q5412030" url="?curid=1079341" title="Europa (wargame)">
<text>Europa is a series of board wargames planned to cover combat over the entire European Theater of World War II at a scale that represents units from divisions down to battalions and game turns that represent two weeks of time. The series was launched in 1973, and is still in production as of 2013, with over a dozen titles published and several more still in production or planning. Most of the titles qualify as &quot;monster games&quot;, a subgenre of wargames featuring extensive orders of battle, a complex ruleset and usually a large game-map area with a detailed representation of the terrain they cover.

==Publishers and related publications==

===Games===
The &quot;Europa&quot; series has been produced by four different publishers, as follows:
* Game Designers Workshop (GDW), 1973–1987
* Game Research/Design (GRD), 1989–2000
* Mill Creek Ventures, 2001–2003
* Historical Military Services (HMS), 2004–present

GRD began publishing play aids for &quot;Europa&quot; under a license from GDW, while GDW was still publishing the games. In 1989, they acquired use of the &quot;Europa&quot; trademark and began publishing the games, both new titles and &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; revisions of previously published titles.

When GRD&#x27;s Winston Hamilton died in March 2001, Mill Creek Ventures (principal owner Carl Kleihege) bought the rights and took over production of &quot;Europa&quot;. They continued using the terms &quot;Game Research/Design&quot;, &quot;GRD&quot;, and &quot;GRD Games&quot; alongside &quot;Mill Creek Ventures&quot; in their publications. They never published an actual &quot;Europa&quot; game, but they continued with the development of future releases and released several issues of &quot;The Europa Magazine&quot;.

In mid-2004, HMS bought the assets that formerly belonged to GRD, and thus took over production of the &quot;Europa&quot; series. HMS published the module &quot;Wavell&#x27;s War&quot; in November 2005, and has released two issues of &quot;The Europa Magazine&quot;.

Under the terms of the agreement whereby GRD had obtained use of the &quot;Europa&quot; trademark, the intellectual property reverted to Rich Banner when Winston Hamilton died, so all &quot;Europa&quot; production by Mill Creek Ventures and HMS has been done under a license from Banner.

The changes in publishers have interfered with continuity in terms of publication schedules—only one new title has appeared since 1998—but there has been a great deal of continuity in terms of the people actually doing the development. For example, John Astell took over from Frank Chadwick as game designer for the series back when GDW was still publishing the series, and designed or co-designed several of the titles released by GRD. He appears not to be currently involved with HMS. Current HMS owners Gar Olmsted and Arthur Goodwin (and formerly Cory Manka, who left in the midst of a legal dispute) are also familiar names to long-time followers of the series, appearing in the credits of a number of the games and/or as authors in the official magazine of the series and fanzine publications.

GRD, Mill Creek, and HMS have also worked on newer game series covering the War in the Pacific (the &quot;Glory&quot; series) and World War I (the &quot;Great War&quot; series), which are somewhat similar to the &quot;Europa&quot; series, though not part of it.

===Magazines and accessories===
During 1976-1977, GDW published four issues of a flier called &quot;The Europa Newsletter&quot;. The fifth issue became a full-fledged magazine called &quot;The Grenadier&quot;, and expanded its coverage to GDW&#x27;s other, non-&quot;Europa&quot; offerings as well.

In 1988, GRD revived &quot;The Europa Newsletter&quot;. Issue #5 saw the title changed to &quot;The Europa News&quot; (TEN), a somewhat more substantial magazine with a stiff glossy cover. Starting with issue No. 11, the title on the cover was changed to simply &quot;Europa&quot;, it was called &quot;The Europa Magazine&quot; (TEM), and it has continued under that name since then, and various subtitles have been in use over time as well, such as &quot;The &quot;Europa&quot; Systems Magazine from GRD&quot; (TESM) on the cover of #86 (with &quot;HMS&quot; substituted for &quot;GRD&quot; on the title page).. (As of July 2015, the most recent issue is #87, published in 2004. The repeated changes in publishers since 2000 have made the appearance of new issues somewhat erratic, but the magazine is still in existence.)

The magazine subscription is also a membership in The &quot;Europa&quot; Association, whose members also receive discounts on game orders and free copies of some of the &quot;refit kit&quot; materials or special maps. As with &quot;The Grenadier&quot; before it, &quot;The Europa Magazine&quot; also covers the publisher&#x27;s other, non-&quot;Europa&quot; offerings. Unlike &quot;The Grenadier&quot;, however, it has not strayed far afield, and still focuses primarily on &quot;Europa&quot;.

Over the life of the series, a large number of official and unofficial play aids, rules variants, fanzines, and other &quot;Europa&quot;-related materials have been published. The most important of these was a fanzine entitled &quot;ETO: The New Europa Newsletter&quot;, which was published by Bill Stone and ran to 58 issues (excepting the unpublished issue number 57) during 1985-1990. Starting with issue #45 in 1989, the subtitle was changed to &quot;The Independent Europa Newsletter&quot; in response to GRD&#x27;s acquisition of the trademark and publication rights for the system. This fanzine was an important focus for fans of the &quot;Europa&quot; system during the years when GDW was sidelining the system and it had not yet been turned over to GRD.

Currently, HMS has an official &quot;Europa&quot; website at hmsgrd.com. The site has information about the availability of published games, the status of games in production, plans for future games in the series, information about The &quot;Europa&quot; Association, downloadable errata sheets, and other material of interest to &quot;Europa&quot; players.

==East Front trilogy==
The &quot;Europa&quot; series had its beginnings as a project by Paul Richard (&quot;Rich&quot;) Banner, Frank Chadwick, and Marc Miller to produce a series of three wargames to cover the entire Eastern Front of the Second World War at the operational scale — that is, with more detail than a strategic simulation would provide, but less than a tactical simulation would merit. The trilogy was to include:

The titles appealed to the historical Drang nach Osten and mythological Götterdämmerung concepts as symbols for the epic struggle between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

Banner, Chadwick, and Miller founded Game Designers Workshop (GDW) initially to produce educational simulations for university classes. &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot; and &quot;Unentschieden&quot; were the company&#x27;s first commercial releases. The game rules were a merger of Chadwick&#x27;s earlier system for ground combat with Miller&#x27;s earlier rules for science-fictional space combat adapted to represent World War II-era air combat (both had published earlier titles reflecting those interests). Banner served as art director for the project.

GDW released &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot; and &quot;Unentschieden&quot; in 1973. DNO was the first commercial &quot;monster&quot; board game. Due to an expanding range of interests that the developers wanted to pursue with their successful new company, &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; was indefinitely postponed by GDW, and will never be published as originally conceived, due to a greatly revised plan for the series. The scope of the expanded series is covered more thoroughly below.

==Expansion from trilogy to &quot;Europa&quot;==

The ostensible trilogy began its expansion to cover the entire European theater when the developers published a game on the German 1940 invasion of Norway, &quot;&quot;, in 1974. They then started working on a game to cover Germany&#x27;s unplanned 1941 Balkans campaign to overthrow the governments of Yugoslavia and Greece, which some believe delayed the onset of Operation Barbarossa by several weeks and may have contributed to its failure. The game was finally published in 1979 as &quot;Marita-Merkur&quot;, named after German operations Marita and Merkur carried out during that campaign. However, it was published as a stand-alone game; by this time the &quot;Europa&quot; concept of covering the entire European theater had evolved, and the plan called for publishing a series of stand-alone games that provided &quot;Europa&quot; material, but concentrated on a single campaign and left most of the link-up issues to be addressed by future publications. The series also grew to cover such topics as the Spanish Civil War, which, though not strictly part of World War II, helped with the map coverage and provided a basis for what-if scenarios, had the various campaigns and battles of World War II gone differently in the games than the historical outcome.

The plans for the series evolved somewhat over the four decades of its existence, but can be approximated as follows. The various games traditionally been identified as &quot;&quot;Europa&quot; Game X&quot;, where X is a Roman numeral. Since some of the games have been published under different names for their various editions, the list given here describes the subject matter for each game and breaks out the individual titles as bullets. Many titles have unofficial but commonly used acronyms, given in parentheses after the title. Acronyms for the games&#x27; publishers are given as well.

Several of the games listed here have had separately published &quot;refit kits&quot; for corrections and minor upgrades, and in some cases those have been included in later printings of the games. &quot;Their Finest Hour&quot; is the most extreme example of this, with both defective maps and numbers of counters needing to be reprinted. Some games have also been reprinted with new box art. Such details are not shown here.

&quot;Europa&quot; I - The German invasion of the USSR and the Soviet riposte, 1941-1942.
* &quot;Drang Nach Osten!&quot; (DNO), GDW 1973. Primarily used German sources for OB information, and had rudimentary maps (by later standards).
* &quot;Fire in the East&quot; (FitE), GDW 1984. OBs and maps were thoroughly revised, utilizing more recently published material on Soviet forces.
* &quot;Total War&quot; (TW), HMS/GRD (not yet published). The final revision for this title. Maps and counters were released to those purchasers who chose this option at the end of 2012.
&quot;Europa&quot; II - The Eastern Front, 1942–1944
* &quot;Unentschieden&quot;, GDW 1973. The name is German for Stalemate.
* &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;, (SE) GDW 1987.
&quot;Europa&quot; III - The Balkans Campaign, 1941.
* &quot;Marita-Merkur&quot;, (MM) GDW 1979.
* &quot;Balkan Front&quot;, (BF) GRD 1990.
&quot;Europa&quot; IV - The Norwegian campaign, 1940.
* &quot;&quot;, (Nar) GDW 1974.
* &quot;Storm Over Scandinavia&quot; (SoS) GRD 1998.
&quot;Europa&quot; V - The Battle of Britain and planned German invasion, 1940.
* &quot;Their Finest Hour&quot; (TFH), GDW 1976.
&quot;Europa&quot; VI - The Western Desert Campaign in North Africa, 1940-1942.
* &quot;Western Desert&quot;, (WD) GDW 1982.
* &quot;War in the Desert&quot; (WitD), GRD 1995. (see below)
&quot;Europa&quot; VII - The German invasion of Poland, 1939.
* &quot;Case White&quot; (CW), GDW 1977.
* &quot;First to Fight&quot; (FtF), GRD 1991.
&quot;Europa&quot; VIII - The Western Campaign in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, 1940.
* &quot;The Fall of France&quot; (FoF), GDW 1981.
&quot;Europa&quot; IX - Operations in the Near East.
* &quot;The Near East&quot; (NE or TNE), GDW 1983.
* &quot;War in the Desert&quot; (WitD), GRD 1995. (see below)
&quot;Europa&quot; X - Potential involvement of Spain and Portugal in World War II, including the planned German assault on Gibraltar.
* &quot;Spain and Portugal&quot; (S&amp;P), GDW 1984.
* &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (FWtBT), GR/D 1995. (Covers the Spanish Civil War as well.)
&quot;Europa&quot; XI - The Allied invasion of French North Africa, 1942-1943.
* &quot;Torch&quot;, GDW 1985.
* &quot;War in the Desert&quot; (WitD), GRD 1995. (see below)
&quot;Europa&quot; XII - The Allied invasion of France, 1944.
* &quot;Second Front&quot; (SF), GRD 1994.
&quot;Europa&quot; XIII - Expansion module giving a bigger picture of the Soviet war effort, plus updates and play aids for FitE/SE, and a scenario for the 1943 campaign.
* &quot;The Urals&quot; (TU), GRD 1989.
&quot;Europa&quot; XIV - The Winter War between Finland and the USSR, 1939-1940.
* &quot;A Winter War&quot; (WW or AWW), GRD 1992.

Material included in &quot;Balkan Front&quot; and &quot;First to Fight&quot;, published in 1990 and 1991 respectively, agreed with the above (excepting titles not yet released), and proposed the following extensions to wrap up the series, though none of them have been published:

&quot;Europa&quot; XV - The naval campaigns in the Mediterranean Sea and around the shores of Europe, 1939-1945.
* &quot;The Naval War&quot;
&quot;Europa&quot; XVI - Rules for integrating the individual games into a single game covering the entire war in the European theater, 1939-1945.
* &quot;Grand Europa&quot;
&quot;Europa&quot; XVII - Czechoslovakia fights rather than surrendering to appeasement in 1938.
* &quot;Peace in our Time&quot;

However, material included with &quot;War in the Desert&quot;, published in 1995, introduced substantial changes to the plan. It included all the material previously distributed over &quot;Europa&quot; VI/IX/XI in a single publication, now officially &quot;Europa&quot; VI but billed as &quot;&quot;Europa&quot; VI/IX/XI&quot; on the game box. It also offered the following changes to the earlier numbering scheme, though none of the proposed new material has been published:

&quot;Europa&quot; V (a combination of the earlier V &amp; VIII)
* &quot;Blitzkrieg in the West&quot;
&quot;Europa&quot; VIII - The partisan/anti-partisan campaign in southeastern Europe, 1941-1945.
* &quot;Partisan War&quot;
&quot;Europa&quot; IX (previously XVII)
* &quot;Peace in our Time&quot;
&quot;Europa&quot; XI (previously XV)
* &quot;The Naval War&quot;
&quot;Europa&quot; XV (previously XVI)
* &quot;Grand Europa&quot;

Material included with &quot;Storm Over Scandinavia&quot;, published in 1998, retained the same scheme, but proposed some new titles:
* &quot;Total War&quot; would be a third edition of &quot;Europa&quot; I.
* &quot;Total Victory&quot; would be a third edition of &quot;Europa&quot; II, and would apparently also cover material originally planned for the unpublished &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.
* The proposed but unpublished &quot;Blitzkrieg in the West&quot; would be retitled &quot;Lightning War&quot;.

Much of this planning apparently became moot when GR/D&#x27;s assets were picked up by Mill Creek Ventures in 2001. Work on a &quot;Europa&quot;-style game covering the campaign in East Africa had already been underway by a group calling itself &quot;The East Africa Map Company&quot;, and it now became an official &quot;Europa&quot; project to be published as &quot;Wavell&#x27;s War&quot;, covering all of World War II not only in East Africa, but in North Africa and the Mediterranean as well. It was offered for preorder in 2002, and was published in November 2005. No &quot;Europa&quot; series number has been announced for it. Mill Creek Ventures also continued development of &quot;Total War&quot;, the third edition of &quot;Europa&quot; I, and has offered it for preorder since 2003. The first components of this game (maps and counters) were released to purchasers at the end of 2012. Earlier in 2011, customers were given the opportunity to purchase additional unfolded maps from Total War. Although development of the series continues, no formal plan for its completion has been announced since the one given in &quot;Storm Over Scandinavia&quot; in 1998.

==Current status==
The current status of the series can be seen at the publisher&#x27;s &quot;Europa&quot; site, hmsgrd.com. February 2013, the plan for &quot;Europa&quot; conforms approximately to the plan offered in 1998 (above), except that no Roman numerals are given for the games, and:
* &quot;Partisan War&quot; has been renamed &quot;PARTIZAN!&quot;
* &quot;Wavell&#x27;s War&quot; published in 2005, joined the list, including coverage of the Italian campaign in East Africa and their defeat.
* The Eastern Front is once more planned as a trilogy, with &quot;Clash of Titans&quot; inserted between &quot;Total War&quot; and &quot;Total Victory&quot;, to cover the years 1943-1944.
* A new &quot;Ike&#x27;s War&quot; is proposed as a module linking &quot;War in the Desert&quot; with &quot;Second Front&quot;.
* There is no mention of &quot;Peace in our Time&quot;, &quot;The Naval War&quot;, or &quot;Grand Europa&quot;

The changes to the 1998 plan indicate an assessment by the new publishers that the &quot;Europa&quot; system cannot be completed simply by publishing the three unpublished titles. Instead they propose that the modules &quot;Wavell&#x27;s War&quot; and &quot;Ike&#x27;s War&quot; be used as intermediate steps toward a completed system.

There was once a freely downloadable set of &quot;Boot Camp Rules&quot;, a simplified ruleset to help people get started with the &quot;Europa&quot; system.

<doc id="1079342" wikidata="Q430036" url="?curid=1079342" title="W5 (TV program)">
<text>W5 is a Canadian news magazine television program that was produced by CTV News. The program was broadcast on CTV, with repeat broadcasts on CTV 2, CTV News Channel, and Investigation Discovery. The program also aired in a radio simulcast on CFRB in Toronto.

The title refers to the Five Ws of journalism: Who, What, Where, When and Why? It was the longest-running news magazine/documentary program in North America and the most-watched program of its type in Canada.

In February 2024, Bell Media announced that &quot;W5&quot; would conclude as a regular television series after 58 seasons, due to cutbacks at the company; in September 2024, CTV News would relaunch the brand as an investigative journalism unit, which will present long-form stories on the &quot;CTV National News&quot; and other CTV News platforms, and produce occasional documentary specials for CTV under the branding W5: Avery Haines Investigates.

==History==
It was launched as &quot;W5&quot; on September 11, 1966, just after the demise of CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot;, at a time when the CTV network was on the brink of bankruptcy. The program&#x27;s magazine format is considered an inspiration for a number of similar programs, including the American program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; which premiered two years later.

The program&#x27;s first executive producer and host was Peter Reilly. He quit only a few weeks into the first season of &quot;W5&quot;, in a dispute with John W. H. Bassett, who owned the CTV network&#x27;s biggest station, CFTO-TV in Toronto. Reilly went on to become the first host of the CBC&#x27;s later current affairs offering, &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;. Peter Rehak was executive producer through the 1980s and 1990s.

Robert Hurst oversaw a revamping of the program look in the fall of 1995. Fiona Conway became executive producer but left for ABC News in 1998. Conway was succeeded by senior producer Ian McLeod and after he left Malcolm Fox became the executive producer from September 2000 until September 2009. Anton Koschany served as executive producer from 2009-2021, during which time the program moved into HD and produced an expanded number of episodes per season. He was succeeded by current Executive Producer Derek Miller.

The program&#x27;s first regular host was Ken Cavanagh, with reports from &quot;CTV National News&quot; journalists such as Doug Johnson and Frank Drea, who later became a Progressive Conservative member of Provincial Parliament in Ontario and Trina McQueen, later president of CTV. During the 1970s, Henry Champ was a longtime host, along with Ken Lefolii and Tom Gould. Helen Hutchinson, who also hosted during the 1970s (concurrent with her tenure as co-host of the morning show &quot;Canada AM&quot;), was one of the first women to gain a prominent position in television news in Canada. Jim Reed joined the programme in 1972 as a field producer and was later appointed as host along with Hutchinson and Champ.

Eric Malling joined &quot;W5&quot; in 1990 from CBC&#x27;s rival news magazine, &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;. In 1991, a new team of reporters also joined the program: Susan Ormiston, Christine Nielsen, and Elliott Shiff. The program was called &quot;W5 with Eric Malling&quot; until Malling moved to hosting the television program &quot;Mavericks&quot; in 1995.

In 1993–94, an in-depth report on New Zealand showed the results of a nation that had suffered the effects of a debt wall. The report had a significant influence and was used by governments to justify cutting social services. The government of Alberta included transcripts of the program when it sent back rejected grant applications and Ontario Premier Bob Rae cited the program during cabinet debates on the deficit. Author Linda McQuaig criticized the program saying: &quot;It was just full of misinformation,&quot; saying that Malling distorted the situation in New Zealand by presenting what was really a short-term currency crisis as something else: national bankruptcy and the loss of credit. The real issue - an overvalued currency - she says, was never brought up. &quot;I&#x27;m talking about confusing the issues,&quot; she says, &quot;making people believe things that aren&#x27;t true because that&#x27;s the point that he wanted to make. You don&#x27;t need to come out with a technical lie to do that.&quot;

In 1996 for its 30th anniversary, the program was rebranded to &quot;W-FIVE&quot; and became more populist. Hosts included top CTV journalists, including Lloyd Robertson, Craig Oliver and Jim O&#x27;Connell.

With broadcast shifting to HD for the 2009–2010 season the program reverted to its traditional title &quot;W5&quot; with a revised graphic treatment and a new theme that reflects its investigative nature and culminates in five notes representative of the five Ws of journalism.

Recent hosts have included Robertson, Sandie Rinaldo, Kevin Newman and Lisa LaFlamme (with Robertson continuing to co-host following his 2011 retirement as anchor of the &quot;CTV National News&quot; until 2016 when he was named special correspondent). &quot;W5&quot; has produced such stories as a possible cure for multiple sclerosis (&quot;The Liberation Treatment&quot;), an investigation into fatal shootings by RCMP officers (nominated for a Michener Award), an investigation of abuses at the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children (&quot;The Throwaway Children&quot;), an annual expose of used car dealer trickery, rampant corruption in Canada&#x27;s immigration system, and personal stories of burn recovery from the Bali bombing.

Since 2000, the program had officially been designated a &quot;documentary series&quot;, with only one or two segments filling an hour-long episode, due to Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission regulations that count documentaries, but not older-style newsmagazines, as &quot;priority programming&quot;. In the 2012–2013 season, the program began experimenting with loosening the format, with occasional three story episodes.

For a period of time in the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the program&#x27;s introductory theme music used part of &quot;Fool&#x27;s Overture&quot;, a song by the UK band Supertramp. The current theme was composed by Doug Pennock, who has also composed the theme for &quot;CTV National News&quot; and music for other CTV special projects, including the 2007 two-hour documentary &quot;Triumph &amp; Treachery: The Brian Mulroney Story&quot;.

On October 24, 2009, CTV unveiled a new look for &quot;W5&quot;, introduced a new logo and began broadcasting for the very first time in high definition. The title was once again rebranded, back to its original title as &quot;W5&quot;. This look was further refined with the start of the program&#x27;s 47th season on September 22, 2012. The start of the 48th season saw the introduction of David Tyler as the current in-show narrator.

=== Transition to CTV News unit ===
In February 2024, as part of cuts by Bell Media, it was announced that &quot;W5&quot; would conclude as a regular television series, with its final episode airing in March 2024. Plans were announced for W5 to be relaunched as an investigative journalism unit of CTV News, which will produce long-form and documentary features across its platforms (such as the &quot;CTV National News&quot;). The new W5 unit launched in September 2024, with &quot;W5&quot; host Avery Haines named managing editor and senior correspondent, Jon Woodward as an investigative correspondent, and TSN writer Rick Westhead serving as a senior correspondent. Its first production, &quot;Narco Jungle: The Death Train&quot; (a five-part report on the Darién Gap), began airing on the &quot;CTV National News&quot; on September 30, 2024. The unit will also be producing a series of one-hour documentaries for CTV under the title &quot;W5: Avery Haines Investigates&quot;, with a series premiere on the Darién Gap airing on October 5, 2024.

== Controversies ==
&quot;W5&quot; came under controversy during the 1970s when it aired a feature called &quot;Campus Giveaways&quot;, hosted by Helen Hutchinson. The feature used incorrect statistics to conclude that foreign students were eroding white Canadians&#x27; opportunities for a secondary education and benefitting from public universities that were being funded by Canadian taxpayers, without exploring the statement&#x27;s backgrounds. The host of the program stated:
: ... there are so many oriental foreign students that they rarely mix with their Canadian classmates. It&#x27;s as if there are two campuses at Canadian universities—foreign and domestic. Certainly this Chinese theatre attracts a full house, but not one Canadian student attended.1

It has been alleged that the feature was specifically directed to form a negative view towards Chinese and Chinese Canadians. As well, it did not determine if the people filmed in that particular episode were actually Chinese or Chinese Canadian. 

The feature led to widespread protests by Chinese Canadians, including Joseph Yu Kai Wong (later founder of the Yee Hong Centre for Geriatric Care). The feature was also criticized by politicians like Bob Rae and Stephen Lewis, both of whom narrated a rebuttal. With the looming threat of a lawsuit, &quot;W5&quot; retracted the feature&#x27;s statement and apologised. The president of CTV at the time, Murray Chercover, issued the following statement on April 16, 1980:

: ... our critics—particularly Chinese Canadians and the universities—criticized the program as racist; they were right... We share the dismay of our critics that this occurred. We sincerely apologize for the fact that Chinese Canadians were depicted as foreigners and for whatever distress this stereotyping may have caused them in the context of our multicultural society.2

This event also led to the formation of the Chinese Canadian National Council in order to form a stronger voice representing Chinese Canadians nationwide.

<doc id="1079348" wikidata="Q171319" url="?curid=1079348" title="Anthony Davidson">
<text>Anthony Denis Davidson (born 18 April 1979) is a British former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One between and . In endurance racing, Davidson won the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2014 with Toyota.

Born in Hemel Hempstead, Davidson started karting aged eight and was soon successful in national and continental competition. He graduated to junior formulae in 1999, winning several titles in Formula Ford and Formula Three. Davidson served as a test driver for BAR in and , making his Formula One debut at the 2002 Hungarian Grand Prix, replacing Alex Yoong at Minardi for two Grands Prix. He remained a test driver for BAR—later known as Honda—until , when he was signed to a full-time seat with Super Aguri alongside Takuma Sato. Amidst financial troubles, Super Aguri withdrew from the sport after the 2008 Spanish Grand Prix, ending both Davidson and Sato&#x27;s driving careers in Formula One. Following his departure, Davidson moved into sportscar racing, competing in the premier LMP1 class of the FIA World Endurance Championship from 2012 to 2017 with Toyota, winning the series in 2014 alongside Sébastien Buemi. From 40 starts in the top class of WEC, Davidson took 13 wins amongst finishing runner-up at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans. He entered three further seasons in the LMP2 class with DragonSpeed and Jota, before retiring at the end of the 2021 season.

Amongst his racing career, Davidson became a commentator and pundit with the BBC in 2009, and has worked with Sky Sports F1 since 2012. He lent his voice to Codemasters&#x27;s &quot;F1&quot; video game series until &quot;22&quot;, and has also served as a lead commentator on the global feed of WEC.

==Driving career==
Born in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, Davidson began kart racing in 1987, competing in various British, European and North American championships. He won three British championships (93, 94, 95), one Italian championship and was runner-up in the Formula A European championship in 1996. In 1999, he moved to single seater cars, racing Formula Fords and winning the 1600 cc Kent engine class of the British Formula Ford festival that year. The following season, he was runner-up in the British Formula Ford championship but did win the blue riband Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch and scooped the McLaren/Autosport Young Driver of the Year Award.

In 2001, Davidson competed in the British Formula Three championship with the Carlin team, finishing second overall to teammate Takuma Sato. His performance improved throughout the season and he outscored Sato from June until the season&#x27;s end. He also won the Formula Three Pau Grand Prix, the Spa Masters and the FIA European Cup.

===Formula One===

====BAR and Minardi====
In late 2000, Davidson became the test driver for the British American Racing (BAR) Formula One team for the season. The following season Davidson started two races for the Minardi team, temporarily replacing regular driver Alex Yoong, who the team had decided to suspend after he had failed to qualify for three races. Minardi had originally planned to put Justin Wilson in the car, but he proved too tall. Davidson&#x27;s qualifying times were within 0.6s of teammate Mark Webber at his two starts in Hungary and Belgium, but he spun out of both events.

He was not given a chance to race in and remained as test driver at BAR. Race drivers were Jacques Villeneuve and Davidson&#x27;s countryman Jenson Button who joined the team from Renault. When Takuma Sato was promoted to the race team following the departure of Villeneuve, it presented Davidson with the opportunity to become third driver. This was especially useful in as BAR were able to run a third car in Friday morning testing, which became Davidson&#x27;s duty. He frequently impressed with his pace, other teams frequently taking note of his consistent lap times for tyre degradation data, e.g. at Indianapolis he set the second fastest lap time in Friday practice after 19 laps.

In November 2004, BAR announced that it had failed to come to an acceptable contractual agreement with the Williams team to allow Davidson to drive for Williams in because Williams would not agree to his unconditional &quot;repatriation&quot; to BAR in . Given BAR&#x27;s long-term contract on Davidson, his chance of securing a race seat for 2005 was therefore called into serious doubt. He was given the opportunity to fill in for an unwell Sato at the 2005 Malaysian Grand Prix, but his engine expired just two laps into the event.

====Honda====

In 2006 Davidson resumed his role as test driver for BAR, now owned by Honda and renamed Honda Racing F1. As BAR had failed to be one of the top four constructors the previous season Honda were able to run a third car on Friday, giving Davidson a bigger role than in 2005. Having previously done some radio commentary work for BBC Radio Five Live, in 2006 he made his debut as a television commentator, standing in for the absent Martin Brundle for ITV Sport at the Hungarian Grand Prix, which was won by Jenson Button and the Honda team. In 2008 Davidson returned to Honda as test driver for the testing at Spain&#x27;s Circuit de Catalunya whilst Honda test driver Alexander Wurz was racing at Le Mans.

====Super Aguri====

On 15 November 2006, Super Aguri confirmed that Davidson would partner Takuma Sato for the 2007 Formula One season. Thus, he became a regular Formula One driver for the first time.

At the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix Davidson was running third when his car struck a groundhog on the straight before the pits, ultimately putting him back to 11th place and ending his bid for his first career points. At the Hungarian Grand Prix Davidson&#x27;s rear suspension was broken during a collision with Giancarlo Fisichella, which forced him to retire. Davidson finished the season in 23rd place having scored no points.

Amid financial problems which threatened their continued participation in Formula One, Super Aguri retained Davidson alongside teammate Sato for . However, on 6 May 2008 Super Aguri withdrew from the Championship leaving Davidson without a race seat.

====Return to Honda====
Davidson was announced as a Honda test driver for the remainder of . On 5 December 2008 Honda pulled out of Formula One due to financial problems. Ross Brawn bought out the team and formed Brawn GP and Davidson signed on as a test driver. On 16 November 2009, engine suppliers Mercedes-Benz bought out Brawn GP and renamed the team Mercedes GP. Davidson continued in his role as reserve and development driver.

====Mercedes (2010–present)====
Davidson was linked with incoming teams Virgin and Lotus for the 2010 F1 season. However, Davidson did not secure a 2010 race seat in F1, and instead turned his focus to racing sports cars. In F1 he continued his long-standing relationship with the Brackley-based Mercedes F1 Team, combining duties as reserve and simulator driver in 2010 and 2011, and continuing his simulator role from 2012.

===CART===
Davidson tested a Champ Car at Road America in 2002 with Team KOOL Green, to assist the team with traction control development. The test was arranged by Honda, Davidson&#x27;s employer in Formula 1 at the time.

===Sportscars===

Davidson raced for the Aston Martin Racing team in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, alongside Darren Turner and Jos Verstappen. His team entered a Lola-Aston Martin B09/60 in the LMP1 class, which finished 13th overall in the race. He returned in the 2010 edition, driving for defending champions Team Peugeot Total alongside Alexander Wurz and Marc Gené. The trio warmed up for Le Mans by leading a Peugeot 1–2 in the 2010 12 Hours of Sebring. However, in the Le Mans race his Peugeot car had an engine failure while leading. Following Le Mans, Davidson raced at the 2010 6 Hours of Silverstone with Nicolas Minassian and secured victory for Peugeot Sport. In October 2010, Davidson secured pole position at Petit Le Mans, and went on to finish second with teammates Alex Wurz and Marc Gené.

In 2011, racing the 908 for Peugeot Sport, Davidson along with Wurz and Gené, won the 6 Hours of Spa, and finished 4th at the Le Mans 24 Hours. Teaming up with Sébastien Bourdais, Davidson went on to win the 6 Hours of Imola, and the 6 Hours of Zhuhai, victories which helped Peugeot Sport secure the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup (ILMC) Championship for the second year running.

With Peugeot pulling out of factory sports car competition, Davidson signed with Toyota to drive its Toyota TS030 Hybrid in the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans. Five hours into the race, as Davidson was lapping the AF Corse Ferrari 458 Italia GTC of Piergiuseppe Perazzini, the two cars collided at the end of the Mulsanne Straight. The collision turned Davidson&#x27;s car sideways before becoming airborne, flipping through the air, before landing back on its 3 remaining wheels before making heavy contact with the barriers. Davidson got out of his car before calling for assistance; he was later transferred to hospital where he was later diagnosed with fractures to the eleventh and twelfth thoracic vertebrae of his back.

In 2013, Davidson continued driving with Toyota for a full season and ended with third place in the drivers&#x27; championship and 2nd place at Le Mans with teammates Buemi and Sarrazin. For the 2014 season he remained with the Toyota works team and drove Toyota&#x27;s new car, the Toyota TS040 Hybrid. During the year he won four races and finished third in the 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans, and became 2014 World Endurance Drivers&#x27; Champion alongside co-driver Sébastien Buemi. The following two years were less successful, yielding only two third-place finishes and championship finishes in fifth in 2015 and eighth in 2016.
The 2017 FIA World Endurance Championship season showed an improvement in form, and Davidson and his co-drivers took five victories and one further podium finish for the Toyota team during the campaign. However, the performance of the Porsche team, a sixth-place finish at Le Mans, and missing the 2017 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;, contributed to Davidson finishing the season only third in the drivers&#x27; championship standings.

Despite his 2017 performance, Davidson was the crew member of the number 8 Toyota entry who was moved aside to allow Fernando Alonso to contest the 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship. Toyota switched Davidson backward into a test and reserve role, and he did not compete in the first two races of the &#x27;superseason&#x27;, including the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans. He made his first race appearance in 2018 at Silverstone, driving in the LMP2 class for American team DragonSpeed, where he finished fourth in class.

==Non-driving activities==
===Commentating===
He has since been heard as a co-commentator on selected Grands Prix for BBC Radio 5 Live. This became permanent on 13 February 2009, when it was announced he would commentate alongside David Croft for the season. Davidson continued in the role through into , as the BBC decided on an unchanged lineup for its radio Formula One coverage.
On 7 December 2011, Sky Sports announced that Davidson would join its British team as an analyst for race weekends, and would be commentating on practice sessions from the 2012 season.

He commentated alongside Croft for the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix to cover for Paul di Resta who was needed by Williams to cover for the ill Felipe Massa. Di Resta was himself covering for regular commentator Martin Brundle who was absent through illness with the same condition that afflicted Massa.

He is also one of the lead commentators on the FIA World Endurance Championship world feed along with Martin Haven and Graham Goodwin, starting in the 2022 season.

===Helmet===
In the studio for 2013 USA Grand Prix qualifying, Davidson admitted that his design was inspired by Eddie Cheever&#x27;s helmet. When he was in the early karting days of his career he saw the picture of Cheever&#x27;s helmet and together with his father, who was a graphic designer, changed the colours from the Arizona state flag to the colours of the UK and EU flags, which he has been using for all of his career.

===Codemasters Formula One games===
Davidson has been working as an advisor for Codemasters since 2009 with &quot;F1 2009&quot;, and &quot;F1 2010&quot; which was released in September 2010. His helmet design is available to select for the user&#x27;s driver in the game. He later worked with Codemasters-Birmingham on &quot;F1 2011&quot; and &quot;F1 2012&quot;. Davidson and David Croft appeared in &quot;F1 2015&quot;, &quot;F1 2016, F1 2017,&quot; &quot;F1 2018&quot;, &quot;F1 2019&quot;, &quot;F1 2020&quot;, &quot;F1 2021,&quot; &quot;F1 22&quot;, &quot;F1 23&quot; and &quot;F1 24&quot; as commentators.

==Personal life==
On 11 August 2006, Davidson married his girlfriend Carrie in Banbury, Oxfordshire. The couple live in Brackley. His brother Andrew Davidson appeared in the first series of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in the UK. When Andrew was up for eviction in week two, housemate Darren nominated him, giving as a reason that his brother had a race the following week and he would want to leave the house to see him. Andrew was evicted that week.

He was friends growing up with the late Dan Wheldon, who competed in IndyCar.

<text>Winterborne St Martin, commonly known as Martinstown, is a village and civil parish in southwest Dorset, England, situated southwest of Dorchester, beside Maiden Castle. In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 780.

In the centre of the village is the parish church of St Martin, which dates from the 12th century and has a Norman font. Other amenities in the village include a public house, village hall and post office. Bronze Age barrows including Clandon Barrow surround the village, and Maiden Castle hillfort is nearby. The stream running through the village is a winterbourne though rarely dries out in the summer now.

Winterborne St Martin is in the UK Weather Records for the &quot;Highest 24-hour total&quot; rainfall, which was recorded in the village on 18 July 1955. The total recorded was 279 mm (11 inches) in a 15-hour period. 

==History==
In 1086 in the Domesday Book Winterborne St Martin was recorded as &quot;Wintreburne&quot;; it had 22 households, 6 ploughlands, of meadow and one mill. It was in the hundred of Dorchester and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Hawise, wife of Hugh son of Grip.

In 1268 Henry II granted a charter to Winterborne St Martin, which allowed the village to hold an annual fair within five days of St. Martin&#x27;s Day. The fair, which in times past was a leading horse market and amusement fair, had been revived, but the old-time custom of roasting a ram was replaced once during an event in the 1960s with a &#x27;badger roast&#x27;. The 80 lb badger was caught in a snare, and many villagers thought they were eating goose.

After a hundred years silence, bells in the church rang out in 1947. Five new bells were hung as a village memorial to those who died in the war. An earlier peal had been sold to defray debts.

In 2007 and 2014 Martinstown won the Best Kept Village in Dorset Award, in the Large Village Category.

The Catholic martyr John Adams was born in Winterborne St Martin in about 1543. The politician Sir Francis Ashley was the main landowner here in the early seventeenth century.

==Governance==
After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Winterborne St Martin is part of the Winterborne and Broadmayne ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

Winterborne St Martin was within an electoral ward that bears its name and extends from Winterbourne Abbas in a roughly south-easterly direction to the edge of Upwey. The total population of this ward was 2,095 in the 2011 census. The ward was one of 32 that comprised the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

<doc id="1079366" wikidata="Q986042" url="?curid=1079366" title="Clapham, North Yorkshire">
<text>Clapham is a village in the civil parish of Clapham cum Newby in the former Craven District of North Yorkshire, England. It was previously in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It lies within the Yorkshire Dales National Park, north-west of Settle, and just off the A65 road.

==History==

The church of St James in Clapham was founded in Norman times, and originally dedicated to St Michael. It is mentioned in records dating back to 1160. The village and church were burned during a Scottish raid following the Battle of Bannockburn in the early 14th century. The church tower was probably erected following this incident, but the rest of the church dates from the 19th century.

In the 14th century John de Clapham, who took his surname from the village, was a supporter of the Earl of Warwick and lived at Clapdale Castle. His descendants took part in the Wars of the Roses on the side of the House of Lancaster.

Since the 18th century Clapham has been home to the Farrer family who established their Ingleborough estate. The family owns, and is responsible for, much of the land, walls, woods, fields and moors of the village, surrounding countryside and farms. Perhaps the most famous member of the family was Reginald Farrer (1880–1920) who was a traveler and plant collector – the &quot;father of rock gardening&quot; – and was responsible for laying out much of the estate&#x27;s gardens and landscape features.

Electricity has been generated on the Ingleborough estate since 1893. There is an operating water turbine-powered generator at the top of the village next to the waterfall. It was installed in 1948. Originally it supplied the church, Ingleborough Hall, Home Farm and 13 street lights. The old sawmill building, which has recently been converted into a cafe, contains a further turbine which has been preserved, in-situ, as an exhibit.

In August 1947 the Trow Ghyll skeleton was discovered in a cave above the village.

==Geography==

Clapham is situated at the base of Ingleborough mountain, one of Yorkshire&#x27;s &quot;Three Peaks&quot; – Ingleborough, Whernside and Pen-y-ghent – and is a starting point for its ascent.

Running through the village is Clapham Beck, fed from Fell Beck which starts on the slopes of Ingleborough and sinks into Gaping Gill, England&#x27;s highest waterfall, where Fell Beck drops 110 metres vertically into a pothole, and exits via Ingleborough Cave into Clapham Beck. The beck feeds into the River Lune via the River Wenning. The beck is crossed by four bridges in the village (two footbridges: Brokken Bridge and Mafeking Bridge, and two road bridges).

Above the village is a man-made lake built and expanded in the 19th century. This river provides pressure for the water turbines and the drinking water supply, while the outflow fed an artificial waterfall at the top of the village.

Clapham lies on the Craven Fault zone, a complex geological fault which marks the division of the sandstone rocks of the Bowland area and the limestone of the Ingleborough area. However, the valley of Clapham Beck has cut through the limestone and into the underlying Ordovician basement rocks which produce soils that are acidic, not alkaline like those on the limestone. This is beneficial to the many species of rhododendron planted along Clapdale, which would suffer in alkaline soils.

==Local businesses and amenities==
The village contains a village hall, the New Inn public house, a community-run shop, a small number of businesses, guest houses, and the Ingleborough Hall outdoor education centre. Clapham used to have a CofE Primary School which closed in July 2020.

From 1939 until 2000 &quot;The Dalesman&quot; magazine was based in the village.

The car park is run by the Yorkshire Dales National Park, with fees going directly to it.

Ingleborough Cave is a show cave open to the public, accessed through the grounds of the Ingleborough Estate. Beyond the show cave a path continues through the gorge of Trow Gill to the well-known vertical pothole Gaping Gill. Local caving clubs set up a winch down Gaping Gill during the Spring and August bank holidays, when it is open to the public.

The Cave Rescue Organisation, which serves people and animals above and below ground across a wide area of the Dales, is based in the village.

The village is served by Clapham railway station which is situated south-west of the village.

==Notable people==

The notable botanist Reginald Farrer (1880–1920) was brought up in Clapham. He collected many species of rhododendrons, shrubs and alpines in China, Tibet and Upper Burma between 1914 and 1920. Many of these were planted on the estate by Farrer. In some places he fired seeds at cliff faces from a shotgun, to give a &#x27;natural&#x27; spread to his rock plants. In 2015 Historic England commissioned a measured survey and analytical assessment of the fabric, layout and history of Farrer&#x27;s Clapham garden to inform the future repair and management of the site.

<doc id="1079368" wikidata="Q407801" url="?curid=1079368" title="Isozyme">
<text>In biochemistry, isozymes (also known as isoenzymes or more generally as multiple forms of enzymes) are enzymes that differ in amino acid sequence but catalyze the same chemical reaction. Isozymes usually have different kinetic parameters (e.g. different &quot;K&quot;M values), or are regulated differently. They permit the fine-tuning of metabolism to meet the particular needs of a given tissue or developmental stage.

In many cases, isozymes are encoded by homologous genes that have diverged over time. Strictly speaking, enzymes with different amino acid sequences that catalyse the same reaction are isozymes if encoded by different genes, or allozymes if encoded by different alleles of the same gene; the two terms are often used interchangeably.

==Introduction==
Isozymes were first described by R. L. Hunter and Clement Markert (1957) who defined them as &quot;different variants of the same enzyme having identical functions and present in the same individual&quot;. This definition encompasses (1) enzyme variants that are the product of different genes and thus represent different loci (described as &quot;isozymes&quot;) and (2) enzymes that are the product of different alleles of the same gene (described as &quot;allozymes&quot;).

Isozymes are usually the result of gene duplication, but can also arise from polyploidisation or nucleic acid hybridization. Over evolutionary time, if the function of the new variant remains &quot;identical&quot; to the original, then it is likely that one or the other will be lost as mutations accumulate, resulting in a pseudogene. However, if the mutations do not immediately prevent the enzyme from functioning, but instead modify either its function, or its pattern of expression, then the two variants may both be favoured by natural selection and become specialised to different functions. For example, they may be expressed at different stages of development or in different tissues.

Allozymes may result from point mutations or from insertion-deletion (indel) events that affect the coding sequence of the gene. As with any other new mutations, there are three things that may happen to a new allozyme:

* It is most likely that the new allele will be non-functional—in which case it will probably result in low fitness and be removed from the population by natural selection.
* Alternatively, if the amino acid residue that is changed is in a relatively unimportant part of the enzyme (e.g., a long way from the active site), then the mutation may be selectively neutral and subject to genetic drift.
* In rare cases, the mutation may result in an enzyme that is more efficient, or one that can catalyse a slightly different chemical reaction, in which case the mutation may cause an increase in fitness, and be favoured by natural selection.

==Examples==
An example of an isozyme is glucokinase, a variant of hexokinase which is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. Its different regulatory features and lower affinity for glucose (compared to other hexokinases), allow it to serve different functions in cells of specific organs, such as control of insulin release by the beta cells of the pancreas, or initiation of glycogen synthesis by liver cells. Both these processes must only occur when glucose is abundant.

1.) The enzyme lactate dehydrogenase is a tetramer made of two different sub-units, the H-form and the M-form. These combine in different combinations depending on the tissue:
2.) Isoenzymes of creatine phosphokinase: Creatine kinase (CK) or creatine phosphokinase (CPK) catalyses the interconversion of phospho creatine to creatine .

CPK exists in 3 isoenzymes. Each isoenzymes is a dimer of 2 subunits M (muscle), B (brain) or both

3.) Isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase: Six isoenzymes have been identified. The enzyme is a monomer, the isoenzymes are due to the differences in the carbohydrate content (sialic acid residues). The most important ALP isoenzymes are α1-ALP, α2-heat labile ALP, α2-heat stable ALP, pre-β ALP and γ-ALP. Increase in α2-heat labile ALP suggests hepatitis whereas pre-β ALP indicates bone diseases.

==Distinguishing isozymes ==
Isozymes (and allozymes) are variants of the same enzyme. Unless they are identical in their biochemical properties, for example their substrates and enzyme kinetics, they may be distinguished by a biochemical assay. However, such differences are usually subtle, particularly between &quot;allozymes&quot; which are often neutral variants. This subtlety is to be expected, because two enzymes that differ significantly in their function are unlikely to have been identified as &quot;isozymes&quot;.

While isozymes may be almost identical in function, they may differ in other ways. In particular, amino acid substitutions that change the electric charge of the enzyme are simple to identify by gel electrophoresis, and this forms the basis for the use of isozymes as molecular markers. To identify isozymes, a crude protein extract is made by grinding animal or plant tissue with an extraction buffer, and the components of extract are separated according to their charge by gel electrophoresis. Historically, this has usually been done using gels made from potato starch, but acrylamide gels provide better resolution.

All the proteins from the tissue are present in the gel, so that individual enzymes must be identified using an assay that links their function to a staining reaction. For example, detection can be based on the localised precipitation of soluble indicator dyes such as tetrazolium salts which become insoluble when they are reduced by cofactors such as NAD or NADP, which generated in zones of enzyme activity. This assay method requires that the enzymes are still functional after separation (native gel electrophoresis), and provides the greatest challenge to using isozymes as a laboratory technique.

Isoenzymes differ in kinetics (they have different &quot;K&quot;M and Vmax values).

==Isozymes and allozymes as molecular markers ==
Population genetics is essentially a study of the causes and effects of genetic variation within and between populations, and in the past, isozymes have been amongst the most widely used molecular markers for this purpose. Although they have now been largely superseded by more informative DNA-based approaches (such as direct DNA sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellites), they are still among the quickest and cheapest marker systems to develop, and remain () an excellent choice for projects that only need to identify low levels of genetic variation, e.g. quantifying mating systems.

==Other major examples==
*The cytochrome P450 isozymes play important roles in metabolism and steroidogenesis.
*The multiple forms of phosphodiesterase also play major roles in various biological processes. Although more than one form of these enzymes have been found in individual cells, these isoforms of the enzyme are unequally distributed in the various cells of an organism. From the clinical standpoint they have been found to be selectively activated and inhibited, an observation which has led to their use in therapy.

<doc id="1079369" wikidata="Q2087531" url="?curid=1079369" title="Winterborne Stickland">
<text>Winterborne Stickland is a village and civil parish in Dorset in southern England. It is about west of Blandford Forum. In 2013 the parish had an estimated population of 520. In the 2011 census the parish, combined with the smaller neighbouring parishes of Winterborne Clenston to the south and Turnworth to the north, recorded a population of 653. For unknown reasons, the 1881 census listed 10 residents of Chorley, Lancashire as having been born in the village.

Winterborne Stickland is sited in a winterbourne valley in the Dorset Downs, which gives rise to the first part of its name. The second part &quot;Stickland&quot; is derived from &quot;sticol&quot;, Old English for &quot;steep&quot;.

== History ==
The Domesday book records the canons of Coutances (St Mary), Normandy, as the tenant-in-chief in 1066 with no change by 1086, after the conquest.

In the Pimperne Hundred, the village had 12 villagers, 20 smallholders, 5 slaves, 9 ploughlands, 4 lord&#x27;s plough teams, 4 men&#x27;s plough teams, 3.75 lord&#x27;s lands, pasture of , woodland of and 1 mill valued at 12 shillings and 5 pence.

The annual value to the lord was 15 pounds in 1086. The 37 households place Winterborne Stickland in the largest 20% of settlements recorded.

==The Church==
The parish church of St Mary is a grade I listed building. The nave and chancel date from the 13th century, the tower from around 1500 and the south porch from the 16th century. Restoration work took place in 1892. The building is constructed of bands of stone and flint and there is a north tomb chamber. The tower is on the west end and is in two stages; it has diagonal buttresses, pinnacles and a parapet surrounded by battlements. The interior is plastered and whitewashed and has a possibly medieval ribbed wagon roof. The font, hexagonal pulpit and the panelling in the tomb chamber are eighteenth century. The screen between the chancel and tomb chamber may use parts of the fifteenth century rood screen. There are various seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth century monuments, and the table tomb in the tomb chamber is dedicated to Thomas and Barbara Skinner.

==Amenities==
There is a village hall, Pamela Hambro Hall, which is used often by the community and is known for its Artsreach shows.

To the north of the village is a children&#x27;s playground, tennis court, football pitch and a clubhouse. The clubhouse is well known by locals for the &#x27;Messy Games&#x27; which usually take place every summer and/or Christmas. To the north of that is a small orchard of apple, pear and plum trees.

Many of the thatched cottages in the village are listed buildings.

There is an independently-owned pub in the centre of the village, The Crown, which was extensively restored by Ray and Tina Clayton in 1983.

The village used to have a post office which had a shop selling local food and other products. This closed in February 2015 and has since moved into the Pamela Hambro Hall on July 24, 2015. There also used to be another village store in Winterborne Stickland known as Stickland Stores (later named Sticky Stores), which closed around the same time as the post office.

There is a MOT centre/garage in the village called &#x27;Kevin&#x27;s Garage&#x27;.

There used to be a school in the village called &#x27;The Dunbury School&#x27;, until 2011. From 2015 to 2023, the old school building housed a nursery, which closed following safeguarding concerns from Ofsted.

The village green is a small area of greenery in Winterborne Stickland which contains the village sign, various benches and a river (the river Winterborne) flowing in the centre. The village sign was renovated and appeared in Season 2 Episode 7 of The Repair Shop in March 2018.

== Governance ==
Winterborne Stickland is part of the Winterborne North ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

<doc id="1079371" wikidata="Q2428733" url="?curid=1079371" title="Great South Africans">
<text>Great South Africans was a South African television series that aired on SABC3 and hosted by Noeleen Maholwana-Sangqu and Denis Beckett. In September 2004, thousands of South Africans took part in an informal nationwide poll to determine the &quot;100 Greatest South Africans&quot; of all time. Votes were cast by telephone, SMS, and the website of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation television channel, SABC3, which aired a series of profiles and documentaries in the weeks leading up to the announcement of the top 100. The programme was modelled on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Britons&quot; series By Helen Joseph

In South Africa, the list was headed by Nelson Mandela, a predictable and obvious popular choice, given his global stature as a statesman and symbol of post-apartheid liberation and reconciliation. Other popular choices ranged from Professor Christiaan Barnard, the pioneering heart surgeon, to General Jan Smuts, wartime Prime Minister and co-founder of the League of Nations, to Shaka Zulu, the 19th century warrior leader of the Zulu Kingdom, to Internet entrepreneur and civilian space traveller Mark Shuttleworth.

Two days after the list was announced, Nelson Mandela had already received several thousands of votes more than any other candidate.

==Controversy==
At the time when the competition was announced, in June 2004, the SABC gave the assurance that the South African show would not ban certain political figures, as was the case in the German version which banned Nazis from the list. They soon came to regret their decision when the SABC became embroiled in a national controversy over the high rankings accorded to some South Africans who were less widely regarded as &quot;great&quot;.

For example, Hendrik Verwoerd, the &quot;Architect of Apartheid&quot;, ranked higher on the list than Albert Luthuli, South Africa&#x27;s first Nobel Peace laureate, or Chris Hani, a famous anti-apartheid activist. Also present on the list was Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche, the head of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging.

Other controversial choices included an 11th placing for Hansie Cronje, the disgraced former captain of the South African cricket team, who admitted to taking bribes to influence the outcome of test matches.

On 14 October, the SABC announced that the show was being cancelled, leaving positions 2 to 10 still formally undecided.

Letter columns in some newspapers called the show a farce and used the term &quot;whites with cellphones&quot; to explain the presence of Hendrik Verwoerd and Eugène Terre&#x27;Blanche high on the rankings. This view was rebutted by Afrikaans singer-songwriter Steve Hofmeyr who pointed out that Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, an anti-apartheid activist who was convicted of fraud post-apartheid, scored high on the list as well. According to Peter Matlare, CEO of the SABC, the show was stopped because &quot;wider participation in the voting process&quot; was necessary.

When the competition was announced, the SABC defined a Great South African as someone who contributed to the &quot;country&#x27;s life and development&quot;. When the show was stopped, the SABC claimed that their definition of a Great South African was actually someone who contributed to South Africa&#x27;s development &quot;and the promotion of humanity&quot; and the fact that quite a few people on the list did not fit this description contributed to the decision to stop the show.

==The list==
This is the original list of &quot;100 Greatest South Africans&quot;, with positions 2 to 10 still to be confirmed by public vote, before the show was taken off the air:

<doc id="1079372" wikidata="Q578322" url="?curid=1079372" title="Winterborne Whitechurch">
<text>Winterborne Whitechurch is a village and civil parish in central Dorset, England, situated in a winterbourne valley on the A354 road on the Dorset Downs southwest of Blandford Forum. As calculated in the 2021 census, Winterborne Whitechurch currently has a population of 734. To contrast, in the 2011 census the civil parish had 354 dwellings, 331 households and a population of 757.

==History==
Evidence of prehistoric human activity in the parish consists of 7 barrows and a linear dyke known as Combs Ditch. The dyke was probably a boundary in the Iron Age but was subsequently modified until it had a more defensive purpose by the end of the Roman occupation. One of the barrows near the dyke was excavated in 1864; one cremation and four inhumations were found, as well as crude arrowheads within a bucket urn. There used to be at least five other barrows but these have been destroyed by more recent human activity.
In 1086 in the Domesday Book Winterborne Whitechurch was recorded as &quot;Wintreborne&quot;; it had 3 households, 1.5 ploughlands and of meadow. It was in the hundred of Combsditch, and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Milton Abbey.

Medieval settlement remains, formerly part of Whitechurch, lie on either side of the River Winterborne, south of the present village. The remains indicate a change in the village morphology, from original settlement along the north–south river to later settlement along the Dorchester-Blandford Road. The change probably took place over a long period of time but it is likely to have been accelerated in 1752 when the road became a turnpike; even now the process is not complete since West Farm and cottages at Lower Street still represent the former layout.

The remains consist of twenty-seven long closes, ten on the west side of the river and seventeen on the east. They measure from in length and from in width and are bounded by low banks up to wide, and up to high. At the uphill ends are quarries and some poorly defined rectangular platforms measuring about . At the lower ends are uneven depressions and at least four fairly well-preserved building platforms, each measuring some .

The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, has a chancel dating to around 1200, a 14th-century crossing and 15th-century south chapel and central tower. The nave was rebuilt in 1844 by Benjamin Ferrey, who also added a south porch and north and south aisles. Until 1933 the church and the western part of the village formed part of neighbouring Milton Abbas parish, resulting in Winterborne Whitechurch church standing outside its own parish.

The non-conformist preacher John Westley, grandfather of John and Charles Wesley, was appointed Vicar of Winterborne Whitechurch by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Commission of Triers in 1658. He was imprisoned for not using the Book of Common Prayer and ejected in 1662, delivering his farewell sermon to a weeping audience on 17 August that year.

==Geography==
Winterborne Whitechurch parish covers in the valley of the Winterborne brook. The underlying geology is chalk. Measured directly, Winterborne Whitechurch village is about southwest of Blandford Forum, northwest of Poole and northeast of Dorchester. The northern part of Winterborne Whitechurch parish is within the Dorset National Landscape area.

<text>Flat feet, also called pes planus or fallen arches, is a postural deformity in which the arches of the foot collapse, with the entire sole of the foot coming into complete or near-complete contact with the ground. Sometimes children are born with flat feet (congenital). There is a functional relationship between the structure of the arch of the foot and the biomechanics of the lower leg. The arch provides an elastic, springy connection between the forefoot and the hind foot so that a majority of the forces incurred during weight bearing on the foot can be dissipated before the force reaches the long bones of the leg and thigh.

In pes planus, the head of the talus bone is displaced medially and distal from the navicular bone. As a result, the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) and the tendon of the tibialis posterior muscle are stretched to the extent that the individual with pes planus loses the medial longitudinal arch (MLA). If the MLA is absent or nonfunctional in both the seated and standing positions, the individual has &quot;sigma&quot; flatfoot. If the MLA is present and functional while the individual is sitting or standing up on their toes, but this arch disappears when assuming a foot-flat stance, the individual has &quot;supple&quot; flatfoot. This latter condition is often treated with arch supports.

== Children ==

Studies have shown flat feet are a common occurrence in children and adolescents. The human arch develops in infancy and early childhood as part of normal muscle, tendon, ligament and bone growth. Flat arches in children usually become high arches as the child progresses through adolescence and into adulthood. Children with flat feet are at a higher risk of developing knee, hip, and back pain. A 2007 randomized controlled trial found no evidence for the efficacy of treatment of flat feet in children either from expensive prescribed orthotics (i.e. shoe inserts) or less expensive over-the-counter orthotics. As a symptom itself, flat feet usually accompany genetic musculoskeletal conditions such as dyspraxia, ligamentous laxity or hypermobility.

=== Diagnosis ===

Since children are unlikely to suspect or identify flat feet on their own, it is important for adult caregivers to check on this themselves. Besides visual inspection of feet and of the treadwear pattern on shoe soles, caregivers should notice when a child&#x27;s gait is abnormal, or the child seems to be in pain from walking. Children who complain about calf muscle pains, arch pain, or any other pains around the foot area may be developing or have developed flat feet. A systematic review and meta-analysis study by Xu, et.al., found that urban sedentary boys, aged 6–9, were frequently diagnosed with flatfeet. The researchers also explored and listed additional risk factors that played a role in diagnosing flatfeet.

=== Treatment ===

Training of the feet, utilizing foot gymnastics and going barefoot on varying terrain, can facilitate the formation of arches during childhood, with a developed arch occurring for most by the age of four to six years. Ligament laxity is also among the factors known to be associated with flat feet. One medical study in India with a large sample size of children who had grown up wearing shoes and others going barefoot found that the longitudinal arches of the bare-footers were generally strongest and highest as a group, and that flat feet were less common in children who had grown up wearing sandals or slippers than among those who had worn closed-toe shoes. Focusing on the influence of footwear on the prevalence of pes planus, the cross-sectional study performed on children noted that wearing shoes throughout early childhood can be detrimental to the development of a normal or a high medial longitudinal arch. The vulnerability for flat foot among shoe-wearing children increases if the child has an associated ligament laxity condition. The results of the study suggest that children be encouraged to play barefooted on various surfaces of terrain and that slippers and sandals are less harmful compared to closed-toe shoes. It appeared that closed-toe shoes greatly inhibited the development of the arch of the foot more so than slippers or sandals. This conclusion may be a result of the notion that intrinsic muscle activity of the arch is required to prevent slippers and sandals from falling off the child&#x27;s foot. In children with few symptoms orthotics is not recommended.

== Adults ==

Flat feet can also develop as an adult (&quot;adult acquired flatfoot&quot;) due to injury, illness, unusual or prolonged stress to the foot, faulty biomechanics, or as part of the normal aging process. This is most common in women over 40 years of age. Known risk factors include obesity, hypertension and diabetes. Flat feet can also occur in pregnant women as a result of temporary changes due to increased elastin (elasticity) during pregnancy; if developed by adulthood, flat feet generally remain flat permanently.

If a youth or adult appears flatfooted while standing in a full weight bearing position, but an arch appears when the person plantarflexes, or pulls the toes back with the rest of the foot flat on the floor, this condition is called flexible flatfoot. This is not a true collapsed arch, as the medial longitudinal arch is still present and the windlass mechanism still operates; this presentation is actually due to excessive pronation of the foot (rolling inwards), although the term &#x27;flat foot&#x27; is still applicable as it is a somewhat generic term. Muscular training of the feet is helpful and will often result in increased arch height regardless of age.

=== Pathophysiology ===

Research has shown that tendon specimens from people who have adult-acquired flat feet show evidence of increased activity of proteolytic enzymes. These enzymes can break down the constituents of the involved tendons and cause the foot arch to fall. In the future, these enzymes may become targets for new drug therapies.

=== Diagnosis ===

Many medical professionals can diagnose a flat foot by examining the patient standing or just looking at them. On going up onto tip toe the deformity will correct when this is a flexible flat foot in a child with lax joints. Such correction is not seen in adults with a rigid flat foot.

An easy and traditional home diagnosis is the &quot;wet footprint&quot; test, performed by wetting the feet in water and then standing on a smooth, level surface such as smooth concrete or thin cardboard or heavy paper. Usually, the more the sole of the foot that makes contact (leaves a footprint), the flatter the foot. In more extreme cases, known as a kinked flatfoot, the entire inner edge of the footprint may actually bulge outward, where in a normal to high arch this part of the sole of the foot does not make contact with the ground at all.

On plain radiography, flat feet can be diagnosed and graded by several measures, the most important in adults being the talonavicular coverage angle, the calcaneal pitch, and the talar-1st metatarsal angle (Meary&#x27;s angle). The talonavicular coverage angle is abnormally laterally rotated in flat feet. It is normally up to 7 degrees laterally rotated, so a greater rotation indicates flat feet. Radiographies generally need to be taken on weightbearing feet in order to detect misalignment.

=== Treatment ===

Most flexible flat feet are asymptomatic and do not cause pain. In these cases there is usually no cause for concern. Flat feet were formerly a physical-health reason for service rejection in many militaries. However three military studies on asymptomatic adults (see section below) suggest that persons with asymptomatic flat feet are at least as tolerant of foot stress as the population with various grades of arch.

In a study performed to analyze the activation of the tibialis posterior muscle in adults with pes planus, it was noted that the tendon of this muscle may be dysfunctional and lead to disabling weightbearing symptoms associated with acquired flat foot deformity. The results of the study indicated that, while barefoot, subjects activated additional lower-leg muscles to complete an exercise that resisted foot adduction. However, when the same subjects performed the exercise while wearing arch supporting orthotics and shoes, the tibialis posterior was selectively activated. Such discoveries suggest that the use of shoes with properly fitting arch-supporting orthotics will enhance selective activation of the tibialis posterior muscle, thus acting as an adequate treatment for the undesirable symptoms of pes planus.

Rigid flatfoot, a condition where the sole of the foot is rigidly flat even when a person is not standing, often indicates a significant problem in the bones of the affected feet and can cause pain in about a quarter of those affected. Other flatfoot-related conditions, such as various forms of tarsal coalition (two or more bones in the midfoot or hindfoot abnormally joined) or an accessory navicular (extra bone on the inner side of the foot), should be treated promptly, usually by the very early teen years, before a child&#x27;s bone structure firms up permanently as a young adult. Both tarsal coalition and an accessory navicular can be confirmed by X-ray. Rheumatoid arthritis can destroy tendons in the foot (or both feet), which can cause this condition, and untreated can result in deformity and early onset of osteoarthritis of the joint. Such a condition can cause severe pain and considerably reduced ability to walk, even with orthoses. Ankle fusion is usually recommended.

Treatment of flat feet may also be appropriate if there is associated foot or lower-leg pain, or if the condition affects the knees or the lower back. Treatment may include foot gymnastics or other exercises as recommended by a podiatrist or physical therapist. In cases of severe flat feet, orthoses should be used through a gradual process to lessen discomfort. Over several weeks, slightly more material is added to the orthosis to raise the arch. These small changes allow the foot structure to adjust gradually, as well as giving the patient time to acclimatize to the sensation of wearing orthoses. In some cases, surgery can provide lasting relief and even create an arch where none existed before; it should be considered a last resort, as it is usually very time-consuming and costly. A minimally invasive surgical intervention involving a small implant is also available. The implant is inserted into the sinus tarsi and prevents the calcaneus and talus from sliding relative to each other. This prevents the sinus tarsi from collapsing and thus prevents the external symptom of the fallen arch from occurring.

== Athletic performance ==
The effects of flat feet fall under two categories, which are asymptomatic and symptomatic. Individuals with rigid flat feet tend to exhibit symptoms such as foot and knee tendonitis and are recommended to consider surgical options when managing symptoms. Individuals with flexible flat generally exhibit asymptomatic effects in response to their flat feet.

According to AAP news and journal gateway, being flexibly flat-footed does not impede athletic performance in children 11-15.

It is generally assumed by running professionals (primarily including some physical trainers, podiatrists, and shoe manufacturers) that a person with flat feet tends to overpronate in the running form. However, some also assert that persons with flat feet may have an underpronating if they are not in a neutral gait. With standard running shoes, these professionals claim, a person who overpronates in his or her running form may be more susceptible to shin splints, back problems, and tendonitis in the knee. Running in shoes with extra medial support or using special shoe inserts, orthoses, may help correct one&#x27;s running form by reducing pronation and may reduce risk of injury.

== Military performance ==

Studies analyzing the correlation between flat feet and physical injuries in soldiers have been inconclusive, but none suggests that flat feet are an impediment, at least in soldiers who reached the age of military recruitment without prior foot problems.

A 2005 study of Royal Australian Air Force recruits that tracked the recruits over the course of their basic training found that neither flat feet nor high-arched feet had any impact on physical capability, injury rates or bipedal aptitude, although there have been results of military trials that have shown those with flat feet to have fewer injuries.

No current studies have been successful in fully ascertaining the long-term detriments to health caused by the overexertion (necessary for athletes/soldiers performing with flat feet) and other compensating measures commonly enacted by the body during bipedal movement.

Another divergent study of 295 Israel Defense Forces recruits found that those with high arches had almost four times as many stress fractures as those with the lowest arches.

A later study of 449 U.S. Navy special warfare trainees found no significant difference in the incidence of stress fractures among sailors and Marines with different arch heights.

<text>Winterborne Zelston is a village and civil parish in north Dorset, England. It is situated in a winterbourne valley on the A31 road south of Blandford Forum and northwest of Poole. The parish had a population of 141 in 2001. In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 90.

The first name of &quot;Winterborne&quot; comes from the River Winterborne, which flows from west to east through the village. Zelstone is probably from the name of the Zeals family. 
The river only flows overground during the winter, hence the name. To the west is Winterborne Tomson and to the north-east is Almer. The river flows through both these villages as well.
==The church==
The parish church is dedicated to St Mary and is a Grade II listed building, being inscribed in the register on 14 July 1955. The tower dates to the fifteenth century but the rest of the building was rebuilt by the architect Thomas Henry Wyatt in 1866, using some materials from an earlier building. Although the main fabric dates from this rebuild, the building has several older features such as a fourteenth century doorway in the south vestry wall, and some of the windows in the chancel, which are thirteenth century. The tower is of rubble stone while the rest of the church is banded with flint and stone and the roofs are slated. The plan consists of nave, chancel, north aisle, south vestry, south porch and west tower. The tower has three stages, the parapet being battlemented and there being a gargoyle on the west wall. Internally, the nave has an arch-braced collar beam roof while the chancel has a wagon roof with plaster panels and moulded ribs.

<text>Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology (MMMUT) is a state university in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was established in 2013 by upgrading Madan Mohan Malaviya Engineering College (MMMEC), which was established in 1962, into a university. 
== History ==
MMMUT has its roots in Madan Mohan Malaviya Engineering College (MMMEC), established in 1962. In October 2012, the Government of Uttar Pradesh announced that it will upgrade the college into a residential university, quoting the lack of technical education in Uttar Pradesh since the reorganisation of 2000, when Roorkee University went to Uttrakhand. The university was established a year later through the &quot;Uttar Pradesh Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology Act, 2013&quot;, which was passed by the government in September 2013.

<text>Winterbourne Abbas is a village and civil parish in south west Dorset, England, situated in a valley on the A35 road west of Dorchester. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 355.

== History ==
In the early hours of 6 May 2023, a large fire broke out at an industrial estate outside the village. The A35 road was closed for several hours.

==The village==
Winterbourne Abbas is a pleasant rural village, only spoilt by the heavy traffic which passes through on the A35. The Coach and Horses Inn dates from 1814 or earlier and was a coaching inn on the turnpike road from Dorchester to Bridport. The Baptist Chapel dates from 1872 and has been converted to residential use. Other notable buildings include the Old Post Office in the middle of a terrace of cottages and the Grange.

The Nine Stones stone circle lies just to the west of the village just to the south of the A35 road and surrounded by trees. It is probably the best example of a stone circle in Dorset. Also near the village are the remains of various ancient barrows and burial chambers, including Poor Lot Barrow Cemetery.

The village has a school &#x27;Winterbourne Valley First School&#x27;, taking approximately 70 pupils of 3 to 9 years of age. The school was assessed as &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; by OFSTED in 2011. 

==The church==
The parish church is dedicated to St Mary and is a Grade I listed building, being inscribed in the register on 26 January 1956. The church is built from coursed rubble stone and flint, dressed with local stone from Ham Hill, Somerset and the Ridgeway. The roof is slate and the tower, at the west end, has three stages and is supported by buttresses. The oldest parts of the church are the thirteenth century nave and the chancel, the chancel having been rebuilt in the fourteenth century. In the fifteenth century, the nave was widened to the north and the tower and rood stair installed. In the sixteenth century the entrance to the former south chapel was blocked, and in the seventeenth century, the porch was added. The eighteenth century saw an alteration to the chancel and the addition of buttresses to the nave. There is the Royal coat of arms of Charles II dated 1661 on the chancel arch, and the Jacobean gallery is carved with the date 1701. South of the Sanctuary there is a piscina from about 1320 with a pyramidal hood and canopy supported by two figures.

== Politics ==
After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Winterbourne Abbas is part of the Winterborne and Broadmayne ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

<doc id="1079384" wikidata="Q358541" url="?curid=1079384" title="Exekias">
<text>Exekias (, &quot;Exēkías&quot;) was an ancient Greek vase painter and potter who was active in Athens between roughly 545 BC and 530 BC. Exekias worked mainly in the black-figure technique, which involved the painting of scenes using a clay slip that fired to black, with details created through incision. Exekias is regarded by art historians as an artistic visionary whose masterful use of incision and psychologically sensitive compositions mark him as one of the greatest of all Attic vase painters. The Andokides painter and the Lysippides Painter are thought to have been students of Exekias.

== Background ==
The works of Exekias are distinguished by their innovative compositions, precise draughtsmanship, and subtle psychological characterization, all of which transcend the inherent challenges of the black-figure technique. John Boardman, the eminent historian of Greek art, described Exekias&#x27; style as follows: &quot;The hallmark of his style is a near statuesque dignity which brings vase painting for the first time close to claiming a place as a major art.&quot; He was an innovative painter and potter, who experimented with new shapes and devised unusual painting techniques, such as the use of a coral-red slip, to enhance colour.
Fourteen signed works by Exekias have survived, while many more have been attributed to him based on the stylistic connoisseurship method developed by John Beazley. His signed pieces provide insight not only into the work of Exekias himself but also into the way ancient pottery workshops operated. Twelve of the fourteen vessels bearing his name refer to him not as their painter but as their potter, by adding the word &quot;epoíēsen&quot; (ἐποίησεν) to his name. This may be translated as &quot;Exekias made [me]&quot;, in contrast to &quot;égrapsen&quot; (ἓγραψεν), which translates as &quot;painted [me]&quot; (literally: &quot;drew [me]&quot;). On two amphorae, Berlin 1720 and Vatican 344, both terms are used in the iambic trimeter inscription, &quot;Exēkías égrapse kapoíēsé me&quot; (&quot;Exekias made and painted me&quot;), indicating that in these cases Exekias was responsible for both the potting of the vase and its painted decoration. Fragments of a third amphora (Taranto 179196) also show the use of both terms, when the inscriptions are restored. This leads to speculation regarding the meaning of the &quot;epoíēsen&quot; signatures and why, in some instances, Exekias signed only as potter on vases that he clearly painted as well. It has been suggested that he chose to sign as painter only the works he was particularly proud of. According to a different approach, Exekias&#x27; &quot;epoíēsen&quot; signatures could be understood as functioning as a general workshop stamp, which would mean that Exekias may have simply been the master-potter who supervised the production of the vessel. Seven of the vessels signed &quot;&quot;Exēkias epoíēsen,&quot; however, carry too little decoration to afford comparison. Only two of the remaining vases signed with &quot;epoíēsen&quot; can be attributed to the same hand as those signed &quot;... égrapse kapoíēsé me&quot;&quot;—that is, to the painter Exekias. Beazley attributed one of the vases with the potter-only signature to the so-called Group E, to which Exekias is closely related.
While Exekias&#x27; work itself offers a glimpse of the culture of ancient pottery, the find spots of his vases also reveal information about the market in which Exekias positioned himself. Fragments of column krater and a hydria attributed to Exekias were excavated on the Athenian Acropolis, suggesting that Exekias maintained a clientele in his home city. The fact that two of his vases were found on the Acropolis, an important religious sanctuary, underscores his prestige as a vase painter. Exekias not only enjoyed a thriving market in Athens; many of his extant vases were also exported to Etruria, Italy, found at sites such as Vulci and Orvieto, where they were buried in Etruscan tombs. Being admirers of Greeks and their arts and letters, the Etruscans developed a taste for Greek vases, over 30,000 of which have been found in the region. The presence of Exekias&#x27; work in Etruria indicates that foreigners also admired his vases, and that he catered to markets both at home and abroad.

== Group E ==
In the words of Beazley, Group E is &quot;the soil from which the art of Exekias springs, the tradition which on his way from fine craftsman to true artist he absorbs and transcends.” Based on the overarching stylistic similarities between the work of Group E and Exekias, Beazley hypothesized that Exekias first began his career in the workshop of the so-called Group E artists. &quot;Group E&quot; produced work that is not only considered closely related to the work of Exekias, but also represents a conscious break from the pottery traditions of the first half of the sixth century BC. Group E has been credited with the development of new, elegant vessel shapes such as the &quot;Type A amphora&quot;. Exekias, however, is the only member of the Group who signed his products which suggests that Exekias may have been responsible for the development of such vessel shapes as the Type A cup, the Type A belly amphora and the calyx krater. Apart from the specialization in certain vessel shapes, the Group E artists also shared a common range of subjects: the birth of Athena, Theseus fighting the Minotaur, Herakles fighting the Nemean Lion, and Herakles and the three-bodied Geryon, are among the themes most often pictured on vases by this group.

== Vessel shapes ==

Exekias does not seem to have specialized in a specific vessel type. Among the vases made or decorated by him are neck amphorae, Type A and B amphorae, calyx kraters, column kraters, Type A cups, dinoi, hydriai, and at least one Panathenaic amphora. Probably his most unusual work is represented by two series of funerary plaques found in Athens (Berlin Antikensammlung 1811, 1814). The plaques, showing the funerary ritual for a deceased man, were probably attached to the walls of a funerary monument.

==Themes==
In his vase paintings, Exekias does not only reinterpret the mythological traditions of his time, but at times even sets new fashions.
One of his most famous works is the so-called &quot;Dionysus Cup&quot;, a kylix now in Munich (Antikensammlung 2044). The kylix falls into the &quot;eye-cup&quot; category and is decorated on the exterior with two pairs of eyes, which may be an original Exekian motif. The interior shows a depiction of the god Dionysos against a background of coral-red slip, which coats the entire picture space. Here, Exekias uses the tondo as a working surface for the main scenario: Dionysus was the god of inspiration, and the painting depicts his initial journey to Athens by ship. Pirates had seized the ship and were planning, perhaps, to sell Dionysus into slavery. Instead, the god caused vines to grow from the mast, frightening the pirates so much that they jumped overboard and were changed into dolphins, here seen swimming around the ship. Exekias is the first Athenian vase painter to depict Dionysus sailing in the expanse of the interior of a cup. While many of Exekias&#x27; pieces display an image from a mythological story they are generally not the most famous moments. The &quot;Eye-cup&quot; that depicts Dionysus does not show the God fighting his kidnappers but instead shows him relaxing in his boat with his kidnappers turned into dolphins around him. Exekias could have chosen any moment, but this is the one he painted.
Another visual adaptation of the mythological past can be seen on the Vatican amphora 344, which is regarded by some art historians as Exekias&#x27; masterpiece. The Vatican amphora depicts Achilles and Ajax playing a board game, with both men identified by their names added in the genitive. Ajax and Achilles sit across from each other, looking down at a block situated between them. The board game they are playing, which might be compared to a backgammon or checkers variant, was played with a die. According to the words written next to the two players, Achilles proclaims he has thrown a four, while Ajax has a three. Although the two of them are pictured playing, they are clearly depicted as being on duty, accompanied by their body armor and holding their spears, suggesting that they might head back into battle at any moment. There are small details that Exekias adds to this piece that separate it from other depictions of this narrative. Achilles is shown with his helmet still resting on his head which represents he has more power than Ajax. Also, Ajax is shown with his heel slightly lifted, suggesting that he is nervous in the presence of Achilles. Apart from the selection of this very intimate, seemingly relaxed scene as a symbol for the Trojan War, this vase-painting also showcases the talent of Exekias as an artist: the figures of both Achilles and Ajax are decorated with fine incised details, showing elaborate textile patterns and almost every hair in place. There is no extant literary source that is known to have circulated in the sixth century BC in Athens regarding a narrative involving Ajax and Achilles playing a board game. Exekias may have drawn his inspiration for this innovative composition from local oral bardic traditions regarding the Trojan War, which may have developed during his lifetime in the cultural context of sixth century Athens. Despite the ambiguity surrounding the origin of this mythological narrative, Exekias&#x27; new depiction of Ajax and Achilles playing a board game was popular and was copied over 150 times in the ensuing fifty years.

The only &quot;kalós&quot; name used on vases attributed to or signed by Exekias as a painter is the &quot;Onētorídēs&quot; love name. The &quot;Onētorídēs&quot; love name appears on the Vatican 344 amphora, the London B 210 amphora, the Berlin F 1720 amphora, and the Athenian calyx-krater which has traditionally been attributed to Exekias. The &quot;Stēsías&quot; love name, &quot;Stēsías kalós&quot;, (Stesias [is] beautiful), is inscribed on the Louvre F 53 amphora, which Beazley attributed to the Group E phase of Exekias&#x27; artistic career.

==Composition==
In addition to the main tableau, in which figures interact physically and often with psychological import, there are often subordinate areas of interest on the vases of Exekias. Border decoration, and particularly large, beautifully constructed spirals with palmettes, frame and enliven the compositions. The central tableau is sometimes framed by areas of black, so that it appears suddenly out of the darkness, so to speak. Characteristically, Exekias uses the shape of the vessel, with its curving surface, as a terrain to which the lines and forms of the painting conform. As the viewer contemplates the vase, attention is drawn to the central scene: the game board (in the depiction of Achilles and Ajax Playing a Game), the face of Penthesilea (in the Death of Penthesilea), the starry robe of Dionysus, the sword implanted in the earth (in the Suicide of Ajax). On the rounded surface of the vase, this point is seen head on. All the other main lines of the composition either radiate around the thematic center or lead to it as the spokes of a wheel: the spears of the warriors, the curved backs of their hunching forms, the wind-filled sails of the ship and its curved bottom, the circle of dolphins. Other scenes are crowded with figures, such that attention is drawn toward the complex composition itself, or to individual men and women in a chariot or the magnificent horses arranged in groups. A variety of compositional devices are used to brilliant effect in the painting of Exekias, riveting the attention of the viewer, who then lingers to appreciate the finely executed forms and exquisite details.

==Line==
Also characteristic of Exekias is his expert use of line, both in terms of his finely drawn figures and also his carefully incised detail—to delineate hair, beards, unique facial features, aspects of armor and furniture, traits of plants and animals, and particularly the patterns on woven or embroidered garments, which are impressively varied and spectacularly precise. This can be appreciated in the famous Vatican amphora (344), on which Achilles and Ajax are both shown wearing richly ornamented cloaks, with almost every element clearly visible and identifiable despite the small scale. Incised designs include rosettes of various types, swastikas with squared or rounded arms, stars, and loops, arranged in panels divided by bands of many types of geometric decoration. Musculature is deftly executed, as are details of hands, feet, and armor, and hair is precisely drawn with a series of lines that run exactly parallel and end in curls; the facial expressions of the two heroes are likewise perfectly accomplished, so as to indicate, within the conventions of black figure, the intense concentration as shown by the gaze of both players.

<doc id="1079387" wikidata="Q1770568" url="?curid=1079387" title="Winterbourne Steepleton">
<text>Winterbourne Steepleton is a village and civil parish in south west Dorset, England, situated in a winterbourne valley west of Dorchester, next to the village of Winterbourne Abbas. The name of the village derives from its site next to a seasonal winterbourne stream and from having a stone church steeple - one of only three medieval stone spires in the county (the others being at Iwerne Minster and Trent). In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 297.

==The village==
Winterbourne Steepleton is a rural village set back from the main road. Notable buildings include Steepleton Manor, a large house built of Portland stone dating from 1870 and replacing a previous building. Close by is the thatched Manor Cottage, built in the 16th century, and Manor Farm, dating from the 17th century or earlier. Close to the east end of the parish church is the 17th century Mill House, built of stone and brick.

==The church==
The parish church, dedicated to St Michael, dates mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries, although the nave has Saxon elements and the tower and porch are 14th-century addition. It is a Grade I listed building, having been inscribed in the register on 26 January 1956. The west tower, nave, chancel and south porch are built of rubble-stone with dressings of stone from Ham Hill, Somerset. The roofs are slated. The tower has three stages with buttresses to the lower two, and is topped by a plain parapet. The spire was added in the 18th century and is octagonal with pinnacles at the corners. Several of the windows date from the 15th century and have pairs of cinque-foiled lights with vertical tracery between.

<text>Jan Jesenius, also written as Jessenius (, , ; December 27, 1566 – June 21, 1621), was a Bohemian physician, politician and philosopher.

==Life==
===Early years===
He was from an old noble family, the House of Jeszenszky, originally from the Kingdom of Hungary. He presented himself in his own works as &quot;eques Ungarus&quot; (&quot;Hungarian knight&quot;). According to scholar publications, he had Slovak, Polish or German roots. His father, Boldizsár Jeszenszky de Nagyjeszen, left Turóc County (today the Turiec region in Slovakia) because of the Ottomans&#x27; military campaign against Upper Hungary and settled down in Silesia in 1555. He married Marta Schülerin, who came from a wealthy German bourgeois family.

Jesenius was born in Breslau (Wrocław), where he studied at the Elisabeth gymnasium. From 1583 he studied at the University of Wittenberg, from 1585 at the University of Leipzig, and from 1588 at the University of Padua.

=== Professional achievements ===
His most important philosophical work was &quot;Zoroaster&quot; (1593), a work of universal philosophy which attempted to recover the lost wisdom of the ancients.

From 1593 Jesenius was the physician of the Prince of Saxony, and from 1594 professor of anatomy at the University of Wittenberg. After 1600 he settled down in Prague as professor and anatomical consultant for Rudolf II, King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor.

In 1600 he attracted considerable public interest by performing a public autopsy in Prague. (His notes on the autopsy were published in 2005 by Karolinum, a publishing house of Charles University of Prague.)

In 1617 he was elected rector of Charles University of Prague.

=== Political career ===
He was also a diplomat and orator, and after the dethroning of Habsburgs in the Crown of Bohemia, he took several diplomatic missions for Bohemian estates and for the newly elected king Frederick of the Palatinate.

In 1618, Jesenius was arrested in Pressburg (Bratislava) after being sent as a deputy by the Bohemian estates, and was held in a prison of Vienna. In December, he was released in exchange for two Habsburg captives. There is a legend that, before his release, he wrote the inscription &quot;IMMMM&quot; on the wall of his prison cell. Ferdinand explained this as &quot;Imperator Mathias Mense Martio Morietur&quot; (Latin for &quot;Emperor Mathias will die in the month of March&quot;), and he wrote another prophecy next to it: &quot;Iesseni, Mentiris, Mala Morte Morieris&quot; (&quot;Jesenius, you lie, you will die a horrible death&quot;).

Both predictions came true: Emperor Mathias died in March 1619, and Jesenius was arrested after the defeat of King Frederick of Bohemia by Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620 (Battle of White Mountain) and executed, along with 26 other Bohemian estates leaders, on the Old Town Square in 1621.

==Legacy==
===Commemoration===

Jesenius was honored during the 450th anniversary of his birth (2016) by a postage stamp jointly issued by Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, &amp; Slovakia.

<text>Witchampton is a village and civil parish in East Dorset, England, situated on the River Allen north of Wimborne Minster. The 2011 census recorded a population of 398.

Witchampton lies close to where the dip slope of the chalk hills of Cranborne Chase is overlain by newer deposits of London Clay. Although Witchampton is sited within the area of the chalk, where cob and thatch are the traditional building materials, the nearness of the clay has resulted in many of the older houses in the village being built from brick. The early 16th-century Abbey House contains some of the earliest brickwork in the county.

To the northeast of the village there used to be a paper mill by the river. In 1980 it was described by writer Roland Gant as a &quot;discreet industrial oasis in an agricultural plain&quot;. It had been in operation since the early 18th century, but has now been converted to residential accommodation.

11th-century whalebone chess pieces have been found within the parish, and are some of the best surviving early English chess pieces.

<text>George Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; James (November 6, 1947 – November 6, 2008), also known as James Swift, was an American track athlete. At the 1968 Olympics he won a gold medal in the 4 × 400 m relay and a silver in the individual 400 m.

==Biography==
===Early life===
James was born on November 6, 1947, in Mount Pleasant, New York, and took up track in seventh grade. He attended White Plains High School, where he competed in the intermediate hurdles and the triple jump, and was a member of relay teams that set national records.

===Athlete===
A double medalist at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, James also set world records and won NCAA titles during his track career. James won the silver medal in the 400 m with his time of 43.97 seconds at the 1968 Summer Olympics, bettering the existing world record but placing him second behind teammate (and fellow Hall of Famer) Lee Evans (43.86). James added a gold medal at the Mexico City Games by running the third leg on the U.S. 4 × 400 m relay team, which set a world record of 2:56.16 seconds, which was eventually tied in 1988 but was not beaten until 1992.

James, at the age of 20 years and 10 months, set the 400 m world record of 44.1 seconds in placing second to Evans at the 1968 Olympic Trials at Echo Summit, California, when Evans&#x27; winning time of 44.0 was disallowed by the IAAF because he wore illegal brush spike shoes. James was a double gold medalist at the 1970 World University Games, winning the 400 m hurdles and running the anchor leg on Team USA&#x27;s 4 × 400 m relay team (3:03.33). As a collegian at Villanova University under Hall of Fame coach Jumbo Elliott, James won the NCAA Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championship 440 yd title in 1970 and NCAA Men&#x27;s Indoor Track and Field Championship crowns at that distance in 1968, 1969 and 1970. At the 1968 Penn Relays, his anchor leg of 43.9 was the fastest ever run in the history of the relay carnival and sparked Villanova&#x27;s scintillating comeback victory over Rice University. His finish in this race is pictured on the cover of the May 1968 issue of &quot;Track and Field News.&quot;

===Coaching===
The head manager for Team USA at the 2003 World Outdoor Championships, James was chair of USATF&#x27;s budget committee and had recently retired after 28 years as the Dean of Athletics and Recreational Programs and Services at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. The soccer and track-and-field stadium at the College is named for him, and features a large touchstone at its entrance.

In addition to the bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration that he earned from Villanova, James received a Master of Public Policy in 1987 from Rutgers University.

In 2003, James was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

He died on his 61st birthday on November 6, 2008, at his home in Galloway Township, New Jersey of colon cancer.

<doc id="1079396" wikidata="Q1172543" url="?curid=1079396" title="Dataflow programming">
<text>In computer programming, dataflow programming is a programming paradigm that models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing dataflow principles and architecture. Dataflow programming languages share some features of functional languages, and were generally developed in order to bring some functional concepts to a language more suitable for numeric processing. Some authors use the term &quot;datastream&quot; instead of &quot;dataflow&quot; to avoid confusion with dataflow computing or dataflow architecture, based on an indeterministic machine paradigm. Dataflow programming was pioneered by Jack Dennis and his graduate students at MIT in the 1960s.

== Considerations ==
Traditionally, a program is modelled as a series of operations happening in a specific order; this may be referred to as sequential,
procedural,
control flow (indicating that the program chooses a specific path), or imperative programming. The program focuses on commands, in line with the von Neumann vision of sequential programming, where data is normally &quot;at rest&quot;.

In contrast, dataflow programming emphasizes the movement of data and models programs as a series of connections. Explicitly defined inputs and outputs connect operations, which function like black boxes. An operation runs as soon as all of its inputs become valid. Thus, dataflow languages are inherently parallel and can work well in large, decentralized systems.
===State===
One of the key concepts in computer programming is the idea of state, essentially a snapshot of various conditions in the system. Most programming languages require a considerable amount of state information, which is generally hidden from the programmer. Often, the computer itself has no idea which piece of information encodes the enduring state. This is a serious problem, as the state information needs to be shared across multiple processors in parallel processing machines. Most languages force the programmer to add extra code to indicate which data and parts of the code are important to the state. This code tends to be both expensive in terms of performance, as well as difficult to read or debug. Explicit parallelism is one of the main reasons for the poor performance of Enterprise Java Beans when building data-intensive, non-OLTP applications.

Where a sequential program can be imagined as a single worker moving between tasks (operations), a dataflow program is more like a series of workers on an assembly line, each doing a specific task whenever materials are available. Since the operations are only concerned with the availability of data inputs, they have no hidden state to track, and are all &quot;ready&quot; at the same time.

===Representation===
Dataflow programs are represented in different ways. A traditional program is usually represented as a series of text instructions, which is reasonable for describing a serial system which pipes data between small, single-purpose tools that receive, process, and return. Dataflow programs start with an input, perhaps the command line parameters, and illustrate how that data is used and modified. The flow of data is explicit, often visually illustrated as a line or pipe.

In terms of encoding, a dataflow program might be implemented as a hash table, with uniquely identified inputs as the keys, used to look up pointers to the instructions. When any operation completes, the program scans down the list of operations until it finds the first operation where all inputs are currently valid, and runs it. When that operation finishes, it will typically output data, thereby making another operation become valid.

For parallel operation, only the list needs to be shared; it is the state of the entire program. Thus the task of maintaining state is removed from the programmer and given to the language&#x27;s runtime. On machines with a single processor core where an implementation designed for parallel operation would simply introduce overhead, this overhead can be removed completely by using a different runtime.

=== Incremental updates ===
Some recent dataflow libraries such as Differential/Timely Dataflow have used incremental computing for much more efficient data processing.

==History==
A pioneer dataflow language was BLOck DIagram (BLODI), published in 1961 by John Larry Kelly, Jr., Carol Lochbaum and Victor A. Vyssotsky for specifying sampled data systems. A BLODI specification of functional units (amplifiers, adders, delay lines, etc.) and their interconnections was compiled into a single loop that updated the entire system for one clock tick.

In a 1966 Ph.D. thesis, &quot;The On-line Graphical Specification of Computer Procedures&quot;, Bert Sutherland created one of the first graphical dataflow programming frameworks in order to make parallel programming easier. Subsequent dataflow languages were often developed at the large supercomputer labs. POGOL, an otherwise conventional data-processing language developed at NSA, compiled large-scale applications composed of multiple file-to-file operations, e.g. merge, select, summarize, or transform, into efficient code that eliminated the creation of or writing to intermediate files to the greatest extent possible. SISAL, a popular dataflow language developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, looks like most statement-driven languages, but variables should be assigned once. This allows the compiler to easily identify the inputs and outputs. A number of offshoots of SISAL have been developed, including SAC, &quot;Single Assignment C&quot;, which tries to remain as close to the popular C programming language as possible.

The United States Navy funded development of signal processing graph notation (SPGN) and ACOS starting in the early 1980s. This is in use on a number of platforms in the field today.

A more radical concept is Prograph, in which programs are constructed as graphs onscreen, and variables are replaced entirely with lines linking inputs to outputs. Prograph was originally written on the Macintosh, which remained single-processor until the introduction of the DayStar Genesis MP in 1996.

There are many hardware architectures oriented toward the efficient implementation of dataflow programming models. MIT&#x27;s tagged token dataflow architecture was designed by Greg Papadopoulos.

Data flow has been proposed as an abstraction for specifying the global behavior of distributed system components: in the live distributed objects programming model, distributed data flows are used to store and communicate state, and as such, they play the role analogous to variables, fields, and parameters in Java-like programming languages.

<text>Woodlands is a village and civil parish in the East Dorset district of Dorset, South-West England. It is five miles (8 km) north of Wimborne Minster.

The village is home to the Church of the Ascension which is a Grade II listed building. In 2001, the parish had a population of 544 but in 2011 the number had fallen to 522.

== The village ==
=== Demography ===
The population grew from 346 in 1811 to 476 in 1851 and then declined to 384 in 1911 but grew from a low point of 323 in 1951 to reach 544 in the 2001 census. In 2011, the village had a population of 522, 272 males and 250 females; the majority (504) were white British and Christianity (334) was the main religion.

In 1831 the majority of the population (67) were employed as agricultural labourers, and in 1881 that had increased to 70.

=== Housing ===
In 2017, the average house price in Woodlands was £447,735 which is more than in neighbouring Verwood (£332,770) and Three Legged Cross (£352,353) but cheaper than nearby Holt (£699,607).

=== Recreation ===
Remedy Oak golf club is south of the village.

=== Parish church ===
Woodlands is home to the Anglican Church of the Ascension, a Grade II listed building. The church is in the Diocese of Salisbury. The church was dedicated in 1892 and was given to the village by Harriet, the Countess of Shaftesbury, in memory of her husband Anthony who was the 8th Earl of Shaftesbury. The church was designed by prolific church architect George Frederick Bodley who designed cathedrals in Tasmania and Washington. The exterior of the church is in plain brick. Inside are three central columns arcading down the middle of the nave. On entering the church there is a large 12th-century circular stone font from Knowlton church (two miles west) which, according to tradition, was used for baptisms by Saint Aldhelm.

== History ==
Woodlands parish was established when the hamlets of Baggeridge, Woodlands and Knowlton (the earliest settlement) were detached from Horton in the 19th century. Woodlands village was then first recorded in 1244. Woodlands was part of the Shaftesbury estate until after the Second World war.

The parish is home to the hamlet of Knowlton with its prehistoric henges known as Knowlton Circles.

In 1870-72 John Marius Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; said that in Woodlands:

&quot;The Duke of Monmouth, after the battle of Sedgemoor, was taken here in a ditch.&quot;

The village is mentioned in &#x27;Owen&#x27;s book of fairs&#x27; in 1788 as having a yearly fair selling horses, cheese and toys on 5 July.

<doc id="1079412" wikidata="Q125537257" url="?curid=1079412" title="Glossary of leaf morphology">
<text>The following terms are used to describe leaf morphology in the description and taxonomy of plants. Leaves may be simple (that is, the leaf blade or &#x27;lamina&#x27; is undivided) or compound (that is, the leaf blade is divided into two or more leaflets). The edge of the leaf may be regular or irregular, and may be smooth or have hair, bristles, or spines. For more terms describing other aspects of leaves besides their overall morphology see the leaf article.

The terms listed here all are supported by technical and professional usage, but they cannot be represented as mandatory or undebatable; readers must use their judgement. Authors often use terms arbitrarily, or coin them to taste, possibly in ignorance of established terms, and it is not always clear whether because of ignorance, or personal preference, or because usages change with time or context, or because of variation between specimens, even specimens from the same plant. For example, whether to call leaves on the same tree &quot;acuminate&quot;, &quot;lanceolate&quot;, or &quot;linear&quot; could depend on individual judgement, or which part of the tree one collected them from. The same cautions might apply to &quot;caudate&quot;, &quot;cuspidate&quot;, and &quot;mucronate&quot;, or to &quot;crenate&quot;, &quot;dentate&quot;, and &quot;serrate&quot;.

Another problem is to establish definitions that meet all cases or satisfy all authorities and readers. For example, it seems altogether reasonable to define a mucro as &quot;a small sharp point as a continuation of the midrib&quot;, but it may not be clear how small is small enough, how sharp is sharp enough, how hard the point must be, and what to call the point when one cannot tell whether the leaf has a midrib at all. Various authors or field workers might come to incompatible conclusions, or might try to compromise by qualifying terms so vaguely that a description of a particular plant practically loses its value.

Use of these terms is not restricted to leaves, but may be applied to morphology of other parts of plants, e.g. bracts, bracteoles, stipules, sepals, petals, carpels or scales. Some of these terms are also used for similar-looking anatomical features on animals.

==Leaf structure==
Leaves of most plants include a flat structure called the blade or lamina supported by a network of veins, a petiole and a leaf base; but not all leaves are flat, some are cylindrical. Leaves may be simple, with a single leaf blade, or compound, with several leaflets. Compound leaves may be pinnate with pinnae (leaflets) on both sides of a rachis (axis), or may be palmate with multiple leaflets arising from a single point. Leaf structure is described by several terms that include:

== Leaf and leaflet shapes ==
Being one of the more visible features, leaf shape is commonly used for plant identification. Similar terms are used for other plant parts, such as petals, tepals, and bracts.


== Edge ==
Leaf margins (edges) are frequently used in visual plant identification because they are usually consistent within a species or group of species, and are an easy characteristic to observe. Edge and margin are interchangeable in the sense that they both refer to the outside perimeter of a leaf.

== Leaf folding ==
Leaves may also be folded, sculpted or rolled in various ways. If the leaves are initially folded in the bud, but later unrolls it is called vernation, is the folding of an individual leaf in a bud.
==Latin descriptions==
The Latin word for &#x27;leaf&#x27;, , is neuter. In descriptions of a single leaf, the neuter singular ending of the adjective is used, e.g. &#x27;lanceolate leaf&#x27;, &#x27;linear leaf&#x27;. In descriptions of multiple leaves, the neuter plural is used, e.g. &#x27;linear leaves&#x27;. Descriptions commonly refer to the plant using the ablative singular or plural, e.g. &#x27;with ovate leaves&#x27;.

<text>Milena Jesenská (; 10 August 1896 – 17 May 1944) was a Czech journalist, writer, editor and translator. She is noted for her correspondence with the author Franz Kafka and was one of the first to translate his work from the German language. After the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, she joined a resistance movement to help Jews and other refugees. She died in Ravensbrück, a Nazi prison camp.

==Early life==
Jesenská was born in Prague, Austria-Hungary (now Czech Republic). Her family is believed to descend from Jan Jesenius, the first professor of medicine at Prague&#x27;s Charles University who was among the 27 Bohemian luminaries executed in the Old Town Square in Prague on 21 June 1621 for defying the authority of the Habsburgs King Ferdinand II. However, this belief has been challenged as unfounded. Jesenská&#x27;s father Jan was a dental surgeon and professor at Charles University in Prague; her mother Milena Hejzlarová died when Milena was 16. Jesenská studied at Minerva, the first academic gymnasium for girls in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After graduation she enrolled briefly at the Prague Conservatory and at the Faculty of Medicine but abandoned her studies after two semesters. In 1918 she married Ernst Pollak, a Jewish intellectual and literary critic whom she met in Prague&#x27;s literary circles, and moved with him to Vienna. The marriage, which allegedly caused her to break off relations with her father for several years, was an unhappy one.

==Career==
Since Pollak&#x27;s earnings were initially inadequate to support the pair in the city&#x27;s war-torn economy, Jesenská had to supplement their household income by working as a translator. In 1919 she discovered a short story (&quot;The Stoker&quot;) by Prague writer Franz Kafka, and wrote to him to ask for permission to translate it from German to Czech. The letter launched an intense and increasingly passionate correspondence. Jesenská and Kafka met twice: they spent four days in Vienna together and later a day in Gmünd. Eventually Kafka broke off the relationship, partly because Jesenská was unable to leave her husband, and their almost daily communication ceased abruptly in November 1920. They meant so much to each other, however, that they did exchange a few more letters in 1922 and 1923 (and Kafka turned over to Jesenská his diaries at the end of his life). Jesenská&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Stoker&quot; was a first translation of Kafka&#x27;s writings into Czech (and as a matter of fact, into any foreign language); later she translated two other short stories by Kafka and also texts by Hermann Broch, Franz Werfel, Upton Sinclair, and many others. Jaroslav Dohnal, the name given for the translator of the Czech edition of Kafka&#x27;s short-story &quot;Reflections for Gentlemen-Jockeys&quot;, is most likely a pseudonym for Jesenská.

In Vienna, Jesenská also began to write herself, contributing articles and later also editorials to women&#x27;s columns in some of the best known Prague dailies and magazines. For example, she contributed to &quot;Tribuna&quot;, and between 1923 and 1926, she wrote for &quot;Národní listy&quot;, &quot;Pestrý týden&quot; and &quot;Lidové noviny&quot;.

In 1925 Jesenská divorced Pollak and moved back to Prague, where she later met and married avant-garde Czech architect Jaromír Krejcar, with whom she had a daughter, Jana Černá. In Prague she continued working as a journalist, writing for newspapers and magazines, and also as children&#x27;s books editor and translator. Some of her articles from the period were published in two separate collections by the Prague Publishing House &quot;Topič&quot;.

In the 1930s Jesenská became attracted to communism (like many other Czech intellectuals of the period), but eventually abandoned her sympathies for the ideology altogether in 1936, when she grew aware of excesses of Stalinism. In October 1934 her second marriage ended - she gave a consent to divorce Krejcar so that he could marry a Latvian interpreter whom he met during his visit to the Soviet Union.

Between 1938 and 1939 she edited the prestigious Czech magazine for politics and culture &quot;Přítomnost&quot; (The Presence), founded and published in Prague by the esteemed political commentator and democrat Ferdinand Peroutka. Here she wrote editorials and visionary commentaries on the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany, the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany and the possible consequences this was to have for Czechoslovakia.

==Death==
After the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the German army, Jesenská joined an underground resistance movement and helped many Jewish and political refugees to emigrate. She herself decided to stay, however, despite the consequences. 

In November 1939 she was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned first in Prague&#x27;s Pankrác Prison and later in Dresden. In October 1940 she was deported to a concentration camp in Ravensbrück in Germany. Here she provided moral support to other prisoners and befriended Margarete Buber-Neumann, who wrote her first biography after the war. Like other inmates, Jesenská was tattooed with an identity number in the camp - in her case the number was &quot;4714&quot;. She nevertheless was given the nickname &quot;4711&quot; (&quot;Siebenundvierzig-elf&quot;) by other detainees, a reference to a brand of Eau de Cologne which was at the time one of Germany&#x27;s best known brands. Jesenská died of kidney failure, in Ravensbrück, on 17 May 1944.

On December 14, 1994, Yad Vashem recognized Milena Jesenská as Righteous Among the Nations.

==Milena Jesenská&#x27;s daughter==
Jana &quot;Honza&quot; Krejcarová, the daughter of Jesenská and Jaromír Krejcar, was a writer for the Czech underground publication &quot;Půlnoc&quot; in the early 1950s and for &quot;Divoké víno&quot; in the 1960s. In 1969 her biography of her mother was printed under the title &quot;Adresát Milena Jesenská&quot;. &quot;Written at a time when the new freedom that had dawned in Czechoslovakia under Dubček was already doomed, it was rushed to the printer unedited and unchecked [...]. In the event it was too late to escape the clamp-down; the book never reached the Prague shops and only the odd copy was smuggled out of the country.&quot;

==In music==
Jesenská was the subject of a cantata for soprano and orchestra, entitled &quot;Milena&quot;, by the Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera. Ginastera&#x27;s work was based on Kafka&#x27;s letters.

British Industrial musician Bryn Jones, under the moniker of Muslimgauze, included a track named after her in his album Opaques.

French singer-songwriter, Dominique A, wrote a song dedicated to Milena Jesenská in the song &quot;Milena Jesenská&quot; of his 1998 single Ep &quot;L&#x27;Attirance&quot; (Ovni Records - Acuarela).

American singer-songwriter, Rhett Miller, mentions Milena in the song &quot;Our Love&quot; of his 2002 debut album &quot;The Instigator&quot;.

French-American musical group Moriarty referenced Milena in the song called &quot;Za Milena J.&quot; of his 2015 album &quot;Epitaph&quot; and her relationship with Franz Kafka.

<text>Andy Donato (born January 13, 1937) is an editorial cartoonist and painter, and former art director for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;.

==Life and career==
Donato was born in Scarborough, Ontario. His father, Luciano Donato, was an Italian immigrant from the town of Fardella in the southern province of Potenza while his mother, Adelina Benedetti, was born in Canada. Donato worked at his father’s grocery store while growing up.

He graduated from Danforth Collegiate and Technical Institute in 1955 and worked at Eaton&#x27;s as a layout artist. He joined the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; in 1961, working as a graphic artist in the promotion department. He lived in Brampton, Ontario in the 1960s and contributed editorial cartoons to the weekly &quot;Bramalea Guardian&quot;. In 1968, he was appointed art director for &quot;The Telegram&quot; and began cartooning for the newspaper on a part-time basis. After &quot;The Telegram&quot; folded in 1971, he joined &quot;The Toronto Sun&quot;. In 1974, he started cartooning full-time. In 1985 and 1986, he served as president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists.

He is well known among &quot;Sun&quot; readers for his signature image of a bird, &quot;Donato&#x27;s bird.&quot; Finding the bird, lost in the newspaper, has been a common device in &quot;Sun&quot; promotions through the years.

Some of his most famous work was done when Pierre Elliott Trudeau was Prime Minister and Joe Clark was leader of the official opposition. As the two leaders battled it out, Donato lampooned both of them extensively. For years, Joe Clark was drawn wearing children&#x27;s mittens (attached to his suit with strings), a reference to the time his luggage went missing on a trip to Israel. The final cartoon of the series appeared after Trudeau&#x27;s airplane was hit by a bus while on the tarmac. It showed a puzzled Trudeau staring at the bus while one of his aides held up Clark&#x27;s mittens and said: &quot;We don&#x27;t know who the driver was, but we found his mittens.&quot;

A notable cartoon was a blank cell titled &quot;Canada&#x27;s foreign ownership policy&quot; - a parody of Canada&#x27;s lack of controls over foreign ownership of Canadian companies.

One famous Donato cartoon, which was widely reproduced in the United States and is now in the Library of Congress was published during the Iranian hostage crisis. Titled &quot;The American Dream&quot;, it is a parody of the famous photograph of the Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima but depicts the Iwo Jima marines raising the US flag while standing on a prostrate Ayatollah Khomeini.

Donato was criticized in 2004 when his cartoon comparing David Miller with Adolf Hitler was published after Miller refused to allow a debate on Chief Julian Fantino&#x27;s contract renewal. In 2014, a Donato cartoon depicting politician Olivia Chow in a Mao suit was criticized as racist. The newspaper issued an apology &quot;to Olivia Chow and anyone else offended by the cartoon.&quot;

It is said that many Canadian politicians consider it an honour if Donato pillories them. When he drew a picture of Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish with both feet stuck in her mouth - Parrish requested the original drawing. Other politicians have done the same, many times. According to his friends, Donato&#x27;s philosophy was: &quot;The first time any politician is targeted, he, or she, gets the original drawing on request.&quot;

Donato formally retired from the &quot;Sun&quot; in 1997 but continues to draw for the Sun chain on a contract basis that pays him roughly $400 a cartoon.

Donato had a dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency over the manner in which he was donating some of his works to certain educational institutions in 1999 and 2001. He was partially successful in his appeal to the Tax Court of Canada, and was awarded costs in the case. The judgment was sustained on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal.

Donato is also a landscape artist working in a style he calls &quot;bent realism&quot;. His paintings mostly depict urban landscapes, particularly Toronto neighbourhoods. He has been the subject of exhibitions in Toronto, New York City, London, and Johannesburg featuring his paintings from 1965 to present.

== Quotes ==
&quot;A cartoonist is a like a blind javelin thrower at the Olympics. He&#x27;s not too accurate, but he sure gets the attention of the spectators.&quot;

<text>Woodsford is a village and civil parish beside the River Frome, Dorset, England, about east of the county town Dorchester. Dorset County Council&#x27;s 2013 mid-year estimate of the parish population is 80.

==Manor==
The Domesday Book of 1086 records the manor as &quot;Waredesford&quot;, which the 18th-century historian John Hutchins interpreted as meaning a ford across the Varia, an alternative name for the River Frome. More recent opinion is that Waredesford referred to a ford belonging to a man named Weard. Two holdings were recorded, which have been interpreted as corresponding to East Woodsford (the current village) and West Woodsford (now Woodsford Castle).

Woodsford Castle is the surviving range of a 14th-century fortified manor house. King Edward III granted William de Whitefield a licence to crenellate in 1335. The house has the largest thatched roof in the county and has been restored by the Landmark Trust. The house is a Grade I listed building.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist was 13th-century, but was largely rebuilt in 1862–63 to designs by the Gothic Revival architect Thomas Henry Wyatt. Remnants of the 13th-century church include the lower part of the west tower and an Early English Gothic lancet on the south side of the nave west of the south porch. The parish is part of the Benefice of Moreton, Woodsford and Crossways with Tincleton.

==Economic history==
In the Frome Valley at Woodsford there used to be a system of watermeadows.

==Demography==
Dorset County Council&#x27;s 2013 mid-year estimate of the parish population is 80. The 2001 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 67. In the 2011 census figures for Woodsford parish have been combined with those of neighbouring Tincleton parish; the population in this combined area was 236.

<text>Viola Meynell, Mrs. Dallyn (15 October 1885, in Barnes, London – 27 October 1956) was an English writer, novelist and poet. She wrote around 20 books, but was best known for her short stories and novels.

==Biography==
Her parents were Wilfrid Meynell and Alice Thompson Meynell, noted Roman Catholic publishers and writers. Her father was a publisher and her mother was the sister of the well-known artist Lady Butler, (&quot;Charge of the Greys&quot;). Her parents had a chaotic and busy literary household in Palace Court, Nottinghill Gate, London. There was a constant stream of visitors such as Eric Gill, Robert Browning, Stevenson, Henley, Coventry Patmore, George Meredith, Francis Thompson, Stephen Phillips, W. B. Yeats, G. K. Chesterton, Shane Leslie, Sir Ronald Storrs and others more or less renowned. 

Viola had seven siblings. Her brother Francis was the driving force of &quot;The Nonesuch Press&quot;, with whom in the pre-war days she made homemade books on the kitchen table, dyeing with onion skins and typing her verse to be stitched by hand into the pages. 

They had a second home in the country at Greatham, Sussex where Viola married local farmer, John Dallyn, and had her only child, a son, John Jacob (&quot;Jake&quot;) Dallyn (b. 1922).

She was an early supporter of D. H. Lawrence, offering practical help in the way of typing his manuscripts and accommodation, by way of a room in her home at Greatham. She was also a champion of Herman Melville at a time when he was unfashionable. In 1920 she engineered the publishing of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; as the first American novel in the Oxford World&#x27;s Classics series in England and wrote the introduction to that volume. During Lawrence&#x27;s stay at Greatham he wrote &quot;England My England&quot;, a thinly disguised and unpleasant jab at her family. Greatham became its own centre with visitors as varied as Eric Gill, Hilaire Belloc, and Cynthia Asquith.

Her books sold well, many of them being republished both in England and in America. She had a large circle of literary friends and correspondents, including Katherine Mansfield, Compton Mackenzie and T. H. White. 

She died on 27 October 1956, and was interred in Houghton Catholic Church cemetery, near Greatham.

<doc id="1079427" wikidata="Q651822" url="?curid=1079427" title="Homunculus argument">
<text>The homunculus argument is an informal fallacy whereby a concept is explained in terms of the concept itself, recursively, without first defining or explaining the original concept. This fallacy arises most commonly in the theory of vision. One may explain human vision by noting that light from the outside world forms an image on the retinas in the eyes and something (or someone) in the brain looks at these images as if they are images on a movie screen (this theory of vision is sometimes termed the theory of the Cartesian theater: it is most associated, nowadays, with the psychologist David Marr). The question arises as to the nature of this internal viewer. The assumption here is that there is a &quot;little man&quot; or &quot;homunculus&quot; inside the brain &quot;looking at&quot; the movie.

The reason why this is a fallacy may be understood by asking how the homunculus &quot;sees&quot; the internal movie. The answer is that there is another homunculus inside the first homunculus&#x27;s &quot;head&quot; or &quot;brain&quot; looking at this &quot;movie&quot;. But that raises the question of how &quot;this&quot; homunculus sees the &quot;outside world&quot;. To answer that seems to require positing &quot;another&quot; homunculus inside this second homunculus&#x27;s head, and so forth. In other words, a situation of infinite regress is created. The problem with the homunculus argument is that it tries to account for a phenomenon in terms of the very phenomenon that it is supposed to explain.

==In terms of rules==

Another example is with cognitivist theories that argue that the human brain uses &quot;rules&quot; to carry out operations (these rules often conceptualised as being like the algorithms of a computer program). For example, in his work of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Noam Chomsky argued that (in the words of one of his books) human beings use &quot;Rules and Representations&quot; (or to be more specific, rules acting on representations) in order to cognate (more recently Chomsky has abandoned this view; cf. the Minimalist Program).

Now, in terms of (say) chess, the players are given &quot;rules&quot; (i.e., the rules of chess) to follow. So: who &quot;uses&quot; these rules? The answer is self-evident: the players of the game (of chess) use the rules: it&#x27;s not the case that the rules &quot;themselves&quot; play chess. The rules themselves are merely inert marks on paper until a &quot;human being&quot; reads, understands and uses them. But what about the &quot;rules&quot; that are, allegedly, inside our head (brain)? Who reads, understands and uses them? Again, the implicit answer is, and some would argue must be, a &quot;homunculus&quot;: a little man who reads the rules of the world and then gives orders to the body to act on them. But again we are in a situation of infinite regress, because this implies that the homunculus utilizes cognitive processes that are also rule bound, which presupposes another homunculus inside &quot;its&quot; head, and so on and so forth. Therefore, so the argument goes, theories of mind that imply or state explicitly that cognition is rule bound cannot be correct unless some way is found to &quot;ground&quot; the regress.

This is important because it is often assumed in cognitive science that rules and algorithms are essentially the same: in other words, the theory that cognition is rule bound is often believed to imply that thought (cognition) is essentially the manipulation of algorithms, and &quot;this&quot; is one of the key assumptions of some varieties of artificial intelligence.

Homunculus arguments are always fallacious unless some way can be found to &quot;ground&quot; the regress. In psychology and philosophy of mind, &quot;homunculus arguments&quot; (or the &quot;homunculus fallacies&quot;) are extremely useful for detecting where theories of mind fail or are incomplete.

The homunculus fallacy is closely related to Ryle&#x27;s regress.

<text>Impulse Airlines was an Australian airline which operated regional and low-cost trunk services between 1992 and 2004. It was acquired by Qantas in 2001 to form the basis of Qantas&#x27; new regional airline QantasLink. The airline had its head offices on the grounds of Sydney Airport in Mascot.

==History==

===Establishment===
Impulse Airlines was founded by Gerry and Sue McGowan, commencing operations on 18 December 1992 following the acquisition of Port Macquarie based Oxley Airlines.
In April 1994, it was rebranded as Impulse Airlines. In May 1994 Impulse purchased Pacific Aviation from Ansett Transport Industries.

It operated a network of regional routes throughout New South Wales and into Queensland. The network included routes to Armidale, Barcaldine, Biloela, Blackwater, Brisbane, Canberra, Coffs Harbour, Coolangatta, Cooma, Grafton, Glen Innes, Hervey Bay, Kempsey, Maroochydore, Maryborough, Melbourne, Newcastle, Port Macquarie, Roma, Sydney, Taree and Tamworth. The airline operated a fleet of Beechcraft 1900 aircraft. It was affiliated with the Ansett frequent flyer programme and its flights had designated AN flight numbers.

In August 1994, Impulse Airlines expanded its fleet and became the first Australian operator of the BAe Jetstream 41. It acquired five of the type in 1994 and had planned to acquire a further five in 1996. Impulse used the aircraft to pioneer non-stop services between Newcastle and Melbourne but was soon met with competition from Qantas who utilised the much larger BAe 146 on the route. Impulse was forced to discontinue the services and withdraw the Jetstream 41s from service. After Qantas lost interest in the route following Impulse&#x27;s withdrawal, Impulse eventually re-entered the route with Beech 1900s in February 1997.

===Low-cost airline===
In June 2000, the airline acquired Boeing 717 jet aircraft and commenced operations as a low-cost airline on Australia&#x27;s trunk eastern seaboard routes in direct competition with Ansett and Qantas. It had ceased its previous affiliation with Ansett. Services initially operated between Sydney and Melbourne and quickly expanded to include Brisbane, Newcastle and Hobart. Together with Virgin Blue which also commenced services in mid-2000, Impulse Airlines brought upon a substantial restructuring of the Australian airline industry. The new low cost entrants injected competition into the long-lived duopoly between Qantas and Ansett, arguably contributing to the downfall of the latter. The airline gradually began to phase in a bright blue livery with a cockatoo on the tail of its aircraft.

In April 2001, Impulse and Qantas came to an agreement where Impulse would wet lease all its services to Qantas with Qantas to market the routes and give Impulse a cash injection with a further option for Qantas to buy out the company. Qantas exercised its option in November 2001, and Impulse was absorbed into QantasLink. The introduction of the cockatoo livery did not progress beyond a few aircraft. Both the Boeing 717 and Beech 1900 aircraft were initially utilised in the QantasLink fleet however the Beech 1900s were soon withdrawn from service while the Boeing 717 fleet was expanded.

In April 2003, following a long running investigation by the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, Rene Rivkin was found guilty of insider trading after having purchased 50,000 Qantas shares which resulted in a $346,000 profit. He was charged with using confidential and market-sensitive information with regards to an impending merger of Qantas and Impulse Airlines. He bought these shares on behalf of Rivkin Investments on 24 April 2001, just hours after speaking to the executive chairman of Impulse, Gerry McGowan.

The airline was a major sponsor of the Newcastle Knights National Rugby League team.

===Jetstar===
After QantasLink had acquired the 717 fleet in 2001 it was planned that Qantas would use it as a base for a budget airline to be launched in 2003. Impulse Airline&#x27;s former 717s were used for Jetstar&#x27;s initial fleet when the airline officially launched domestic passenger service between Newcastle and Melbourne on 24 May 2004, one day before Impulse Airlines ceased operations.

The facilities developed by Impulse Airlines for its Newcastle base continued to be used as a heavy maintenance base for Jetstar until June 2020, despite Jetstar&#x27;s headquarters being in Melbourne.

<doc id="1079432" wikidata="Q1529124" url="?curid=1079432" title="Subdivision surface">
<text>In the field of 3D computer graphics, a subdivision surface (commonly shortened to SubD surface or Subsurf) is a curved surface represented by the specification of a coarser polygon mesh and produced by a recursive algorithmic method. The curved surface, the underlying &quot;inner mesh&quot;, can be calculated from the coarse mesh, known as the &quot;control cage&quot; or &quot;outer mesh&quot;, as the functional limit of an iterative process of subdividing each polygonal face into smaller faces that better approximate the final underlying curved surface. Less commonly, a simple algorithm is used to add geometry to a mesh by subdividing the faces into smaller ones without changing the overall shape or volume.

The opposite is reducing polygons or un-subdividing.

==Overview==
A subdivision surface algorithm is recursive in nature. The process starts with a base level polygonal mesh. A refinement scheme is then applied to this mesh. This process takes that mesh and subdivides it, creating new vertices and new faces. The positions of the new vertices in the mesh are computed based on the positions of nearby old vertices, edges, and/or faces. In many refinement schemes, the positions of old vertices are also altered (possibly based on the positions of new vertices).

This process produces a &quot;denser&quot; mesh than the original one, containing more polygonal faces (often by a factor of 4). This resulting mesh can be passed through the same refinement scheme again and again to produce more and more refined meshes. Each iteration is often called a subdivision &quot;level&quot;, starting at zero (before any refinement occurs).

The &quot;limit&quot; subdivision surface is the surface produced from this process being iteratively applied infinitely many times. In practical use however, this algorithm is only applied a limited, and fairly small (formula_1), number of times.

Mathematically, the neighborhood of an &quot;extraordinary vertex&quot; (non-4-valent node for quad refined meshes) of a subdivision surface is a spline with a parametrically singular point.

==Refinement schemes==

Subdivision surface refinement schemes can be broadly classified into two categories: &quot;interpolating&quot; and &quot;approximating&quot;.

* Interpolating schemes are required to match the original position of vertices in the original mesh.
* Approximating schemes are not; they can and will adjust these positions as needed.

In general, approximating schemes have greater smoothness, but the user has less overall control of the outcome. This is analogous to spline surfaces and curves, where Bézier curves are required to interpolate certain control points, while B-Splines are not (and are more approximate).

Subdivision surface schemes can also be categorized by the type of polygon that they operate on: some function best for quadrilaterals (quads), while others primarily operate on triangles (tris).

===Approximating schemes===

&quot;Approximating&quot; means that the limit surfaces approximate the initial meshes, and that after subdivision the newly generated control points are not in the limit surfaces. There are five approximating subdivision schemes:
* Catmull and Clark (1978), Quads – generalizes bi-cubic uniform B-spline knot insertion. For arbitrary initial meshes, this scheme generates limit surfaces that are C2 continuous everywhere except at extraordinary vertices where they are C1 continuous (Peters and Reif 1998).
* Doo-Sabin (1978), Quads – The second subdivision scheme was developed by Doo and Sabin, who successfully extended Chaikin&#x27;s corner-cutting method (George Chaikin, 1974) for curves to surfaces. They used the analytical expression of bi-quadratic uniform B-spline surface to generate their subdivision procedure to produce C1 limit surfaces with arbitrary topology for arbitrary initial meshes. An auxiliary point can improve the shape of Doo-Sabin subdivision. After a subdivision, all vertices have &quot;valence&quot; 4.
* Loop (1987), Triangles – Loop proposed his subdivision scheme based on a quartic box-spline of six direction vectors to provide a rule to generate C2 continuous limit surfaces everywhere except at extraordinary vertices where they are C1 continuous (Zorin 1997). 
* Mid-Edge subdivision scheme (1997–1999) – The mid-edge subdivision scheme was proposed independently by Peters-Reif (1997) and Habib-Warren (1999). The former used the mid-point of each edge to build the new mesh. The latter used a four-directional box spline to build the scheme. This scheme generates C1 continuous limit surfaces on initial meshes with arbitrary topology. (Mid-Edge subdivision, which could be called &quot;√2 subdivision&quot; since two steps halve distances, could be considered the slowest.)
* √3 subdivision scheme (2000), Triangles – This scheme was developed by Kobbelt and offers several interesting features: it handles arbitrary triangular meshes, it is C2 continuous everywhere except at extraordinary vertices where it is C1 continuous and it offers a natural adaptive refinement when required. It exhibits at least two specificities: it is a &quot;Dual&quot; scheme for triangle meshes and it has a slower refinement rate than primal ones.
===Interpolating schemes===
After subdivision, the control points of the original mesh and the newly generated control points are interpolated on the limit surface. The earliest work was so-called &quot;butterfly scheme&quot; by Dyn, Levin and Gregory (1990), who extended the four-point interpolatory subdivision scheme for curves to a subdivision scheme for surface. Zorin, Schröder and Sweldens (1996) noticed that the butterfly scheme cannot generate smooth surfaces for irregular triangle meshes and thus modified this scheme. Kobbelt (1996) further generalized the four-point interpolatory subdivision scheme for curves to the tensor product subdivision scheme for surfaces. In 1991, Nasri proposed a scheme for interpolating Doo-Sabin; while in 1993 Halstead, Kass, and DeRose proposed one for Catmull-Clark.

* Butterfly (1990), Triangles – named after the scheme&#x27;s shape
* Modified Butterfly (1996), Quads – designed to overcome artifacts generated by irregular topology
* Kobbelt (1996), Quads – a variational subdivision method that tries to overcome uniform subdivision drawbacks

==Key developments==
* 1978: Subdivision surfaces were described by Edwin Catmull and Jim Clark (see Catmull-Clark subdivision surface), and by Daniel Doo and Malcom Sabin (see Doo-Sabin subdivision surfaces).
* 1995: Ulrich Reif solved subdivision surface behaviour near extraordinary vertices.
* 1998: Jos Stam contributed a method for exact evaluation for Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces under arbitrary parameter values.

<text>Wootton Fitzpaine is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in South West England. It lies approximately north-east of Lyme Regis in a small side valley of the River Char, close to the Marshwood Vale. The civil parish covers an area of and includes the ecclesiastical parish and small settlement of Monkton Wyld to the west. In the 2011 census the civil parish had 180 dwellings, 134 households and a population of 345.

==Wootton Fitzpaine village==

Wootton Fitzpaine village consists primarily of two small centres: a larger western part comprising the village hall and about 50 densely placed houses, and a smaller eastern part comprising about a dozen houses, the church and manor house. The village is sited on Middle Lias and greensand and has a history of being agriculturally relatively prosperous.

The village name derives from &#x27;Wodetone&#x27;, meaning a farm close to a wood, plus the name of the manorial family, Fitzpaine.

The parish church was built mostly between the 13th and 15th centuries but was restored and added to in 1872. It lies within the grounds of the adjacent Wootton House, a three-storey brick-built house re-built in about 1765 by Thomas Rose-Drewe (1740-1815), second grandson of Thomas Rose (died 1747) of Wootton House, but also restored and added to in the late 19th century. The rectory dates from the end of the 15th century. Twenty structures within the parish are listed by English Heritage for their historic or architectural interest.

The village has a website http://www.wootton-fitzpaine.co.uk/

==Monkton Wyld village==
St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Monkton Wyld was designed by Richard Cromwell Carpenter.

Monkton Wyld Court is the largest building in this hamlet, a Grade II listed Victoria Gothic former rectory built in 1848. It was also designed by Carpenter. It offers terraced south facing lawns, a dairy farm and an organic walled kitchen garden. The building was used between 1940 and 1982 as a progressive boarding school. In 1982, Simon Fairlie and Gill Barron run it as an educational centre for sustainable living, The Land is Ours campaigns for &quot;Landrights in Britain&quot; there, and Guest House accommodates 42 visitors.

==Footpaths and trails==
The Wessex Ridgeway and Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpaths pass through the parish, as does the Liberty Trail, a more local designated way.

*Richard Rose (died 1658), a member of the Long Parliament
*Thomas Rose (died 1747), Sheriff of Dorset in 1715

<text>Rankism is &quot;abusive, discriminatory, and/or exploitative behavior towards people because of their rank in a particular hierarchy&quot;.
Rank-based abuse underlies many other phenomena such as bullying, racism, supremacism (often white supremacy), xenophobia, hazing, ageism, sexism, ableism, mentalism, antisemitism, homophobia and transphobia. The term &quot;rankism&quot; was popularized by physicist, educator, and citizen diplomat Robert W. Fuller.

== Characteristics ==

Rankism can take many forms, including
* exploiting one&#x27;s position within a hierarchy to secure unwarranted advantages and benefits (e.g. massive corporate bonuses);
* abusing a position of power (e.g., abusive parent or priest, corrupt CEO, bully boss, prisoner abuse);
* using rank as a shield to get away with insulting or humiliating others with impunity;
* using rank to maintain a position of power long after it can be justified;
* exporting the rank achieved in one sphere of activity to claim superior value as a person;
* exploiting rank that is illegitimately acquired or held (as in situations resting on specious distinctions of social rank, such as racism, sexism, intellectualism, wealth, religious beliefs, hereditary, marital status, gang affiliation, criminal record, egotism or classism).

Rankism can occur in any social hierarchy, such as governments, corporations, families, non-profit organizations, and universities.

== Use of term ==

The term rankism first appeared in print in the &quot;Oberlin Alumni Magazine&quot; for fall of 1997. It later appeared in a book called &quot;Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank,&quot; written by Fuller and published in 2003.

The first use of the term in a management journal occurred in 2001 in a &quot;Leader to Leader Institute&quot; article. The piece questioned the abuse of rank in work hierarchies. The idea of rankism has since been widely covered in the media, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;NPR&quot;, &quot;C-SPAN&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the &quot;BBC&quot;, &quot;Voice of America&quot;, and &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot;.

Other notable references of rankism include Fuller&#x27;s second book on the subject, &quot;All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity,&quot; and an action-oriented guide titled &quot;Dignity for All: How to Create a World Without Rankism.&quot;

The Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies (Human DHS) network has also accepted the concept of rankism as core to its mission. It asserts, &quot;...the mission we have undertaken at Human DHS is the confrontation of abuse, rankism and the humiliation endemic to it, on the historical scale.&quot;

Professional mediator Julia Ann Wambach uses Fuller&#x27;s definition of rankism to explore the abuse of position within a hierarchy from both up and down the lines of power, including how rankism feeds on itself in group contexts.

== Rankism and dignity ==

According to Fuller, the abuse of rank is experienced by victims as an affront to their dignity. Fuller and his supporters have launched a new social movement to promote the creation of a dignitarian society. The Dignity Movement&#x27;s goal is to overcome rankism in the same way that the civil rights movement and women&#x27;s movements target racism and sexism.
