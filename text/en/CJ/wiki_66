<text>The distribution of wealth is a comparison of the wealth of various members or groups in a society. It shows one aspect of economic inequality or economic heterogeneity.

The distribution of wealth differs from the income distribution in that it looks at the economic distribution of ownership of the assets in a society, rather than the current income of members of that society. According to the International Association for Research in Income and Wealth, &quot;the world distribution of wealth is much more unequal than that of income.&quot;

For rankings regarding wealth, see list of countries by wealth equality or list of countries by wealth per adult.

==Definition of wealth==

Wealth of an individual is defined as net worth, expressed as: wealth = assets − liabilities

A broader definition of wealth, which is rarely used in the measurement of wealth inequality, also includes human capital. For example, the United Nations definition of &quot;inclusive wealth&quot; is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human and physical assets.

The relation between wealth, income, and expenses is: change of wealth = saving = income − consumption (expenses). If an individual has a large income but also large expenses, the net effect of that income on her or his wealth could be small or even negative.

== Conceptual framework ==

There are many ways in which the distribution of wealth can be analyzed. One common-used example is to compare the amount of the wealth of individual at say 99 percentile relative to the wealth of the median (or 50th) percentile. This is P99/P50 is one of the potential Kuznets ratios which is the inverted U shape that indicates the relationship between the inequality and the income per capita. Another common measure is the ratio of total amount of wealth in the hand of top say 1% of the wealth distribution over the total wealth in the economy. In many societies, the richest ten percent control more than half of the total wealth.

The &quot;Pareto Distribution&quot; has often been used to mathematically quantify the distribution of wealth at the right tail (the wealth of the very rich); stating that the upper 20% owns 80%, the upper 4% owns 64%, the upper 0.8% owns 51.2%, etc. In fact, the tail of wealth distributions, similar to that of income distribution, behaves like a Pareto distribution but with a thicker tail.

&quot;Wealth over people (WOP) curves&quot; are a visually compelling way to show the distribution of wealth in a nation. WOP curves are modified distribution of wealth curves. The vertical and horizontal scales each show percentages from zero to one hundred. We imagine all the households in a nation being sorted from richest to poorest. They are then shrunk down and lined up (richest at the left) along the horizontal scale. For any particular household, its point on the curve represents how their wealth compares (as a proportion) to the average wealth of the richest percentile. For any nation, the average wealth of the richest 1/100 of households is the topmost point on the curve (people, 1%; wealth, 100%) or (p=1, w=100) or (1, 100). In the real world two points on the WOP curve are always known before any statistics are gathered. These are the topmost point (1, 100) by definition, and the rightmost point (poorest people, lowest wealth) or (p=100, w=0) or (100, 0). This unfortunate rightmost point is given because there are always at least one percent of households (incarcerated, long term illness, etc.) with no wealth at all. Given that the topmost and rightmost points are fixed ... our interest lies in the form of the WOP curve between them. There are two extreme possible forms of the curve. The first is the &quot;perfect communist&quot; WOP. It is a straight line from the leftmost (maximum wealth) point horizontally across the people scale to p=99. Then it drops vertically to wealth = 0 at (p=100, w=0).

The other extreme is the &quot;perfect tyranny&quot; form. It starts on the left at the Tyrant&#x27;s maximum wealth of 100%. It then immediately drops to zero at p=2, and continues at zero horizontally across the rest of the people. That is, the tyrant and his friends (the top percentile) own all the nation&#x27;s wealth. All other citizens are serfs or slaves. An obvious intermediate form is a straight line connecting the left/top point to the right/bottom point. In such a &quot;Diagonal&quot; society a household in the richest percentile would have just twice the wealth of a family in the median (50th) percentile. Such a society is compelling to many (especially the poor). In fact it is a comparison to a diagonal society that is the basis for the Gini values used as a measure of the disequity in a particular economy. These Gini values (40.8 in 2007) show the United States to be the third most dis-equitable economy of all the developed nations (behind Denmark and Switzerland).

More sophisticated models have also been proposed.

== Theoretical approaches ==
To model aspects of the distribution and holdings of wealth, there have been many different types of theories used. Before the 1960s, the data regarding this was collected mostly from wealth tax and estate tax records, with further proof gathered from small unrepresentative examinations and a variety of other sources. The results from these sources tended to show that the distribution of wealth was very unequal, and that material inheritance had a big role in the matter of wealth differences and in the transmission of the status of wealth from generation to generation. There was also reason to believe that the inequality in wealth was shrinking over time, and also the distribution&#x27;s shape demonstrated particular statistical regularities that could not have been caused by coincidence. Thus, early theoretical work on the distribution of wealth wanted to explain the statistical regularities, and also comprehend the relationship of basic forces which could be an explanation for the concentration of wealth to be high and the trend of declining over time.

More lately, the research about wealth distribution has moved away from the worry with overall distributional characteristics, and in its place focuses more on the grounds of individual differences in the holdings of wealth. This change was caused partly because the importance of saving for retirement increased, and it is reflected in the vital role now assigned to the model of lifecycle savings developed by Modigliani and Brumberg (1954), and Ando and Modigliani (1963). Another important progress has been the increase in availability and finesse in sets of micro-data, which offer not just estimations of individuals&#x27; asset holdings and savings but also a variety of other household and personal characteristics that can assist in explain the differences in wealth.

== Wealth inequality ==
Wealth inequality refers to uneven distribution of wealth among individuals and entities. Although most research depends on written sources, archaeologists and anthropologists often view large houses as occupied by wealthy households. The distribution of contemporaneous house sizes in a society (perhaps analyzed using the Gini coefficient) then can regarded as a measure of wealth inequality. This approach has been used at least since 2014 and has shown, for example, that ancient wealth disparities in Eurasia were greater than those in North America and in Mesoamerica following the earliest Neolithic period.

=== Global inequality statistics ===
A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000, and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total. The bottom half of the world adult population owned 1% of global wealth. A 2006 study found that the richest 2% own more than half of global household assets. The Pareto distribution gives 52.8% owned by the upper 1%.

According to the OECD in 2012 the top 0.6% of world population (consisting of adults with more than US$1 million in assets) or the 42 million richest people in the world held 39.3% of world wealth. The next 4.4% (311 million people) held 32.3% of world wealth. The bottom 95% held 28.4% of world wealth. The large gaps of the report get by the Gini index to 0.893, and are larger than gaps in global income inequality, measured in 2009 at 0.38. For example, in 2012 the bottom 60% of the world population held the same wealth in 2012 as the people on Forbes&#x27; Richest list consisting of 1,226 richest billionaires of the world.

A 2021 Oxfam report found that collectively, the 10 richest men in the world owned more than the combined wealth of the bottom 3.1 billion people, almost half of the entire world population. Their combined wealth doubled during the pandemic.

‘Global wealth Report 2021’, published by Credit Suisse, shows a substantial worldwide increase in wealth inequality during 2020. According to Credit Suisse, wealth distribution pyramid in 2020 shows that the richest group of adult population (1.1%) owns 45.8% of the total wealth. When compared to the 2013 wealth distribution pyramid, an overall increase of 4.8% can be seen. The bottom half of the world’s total adult population, the bottom quartile in the pyramid, owns only 1.3% of the total wealth. Again, when compared to the 2013 wealth distribution pyramid, a decrease of 1.7% can be observed. In conclusion, this comparison shows a substantial worldwide increase in wealth inequality over these years.

One of the main explanations for the ongoing increase of wealth inequality are the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit Suisse claims that the economic impact of the pandemic on employment and incomes in 2020 are likely to have a negative effect for the lowest groups of wealth holders, forcing them to spend more from their savings or incur higher debt. On the other hand, top wealth groups appeared to be relatively unaffected in this negative way. Moreover, they seemed to benefit from the impact of lower interest rates on share and house prices.

According to the ‘Global Wealth Report 2021’ published by Credit Suisse, there are 56 million millionaires in the world in 2020, increasing by 5.2 million from a year earlier. The biggest number of dollar millionaires is reported in the USA, with 22 million millionaires (approximately 39% of the world total). This is far ahead of China, holding second place, with 9.4% of all global millionaires. The third place is currently being held by Japan, with 6.6% of all global millionaires.

====Real estate====

While sizeable numbers of households own no land, few have no income. For example, the top 10% of land owners (all corporations) in Baltimore, Maryland own 58% of the taxable land value. The bottom 10% of those who own any land own less than 1% of the total land value. This form of analysis as well as Gini coefficient analysis has been used to support land value taxation.

=== Wealth distribution pyramid ===

In 2013, Credit Suisse prepared a &quot;wealth pyramid&quot; infographic (shown right). Personal assets were calculated in net worth, meaning wealth would be negated by having any mortgages. It has a large base of low wealth holders, alongside upper tiers occupied by progressively fewer people. In 2013 Credit-suisse estimate that 3.2 billion individuals – more than two thirds of adults in the world – have wealth below US$10,000. A further one billion (adult population) fall within the 10,000 – US$100,000 range. While the average wealth holding is modest in the base and middle segments of the pyramid, their total wealth amounts to US$40 trillion, underlining the potential for novel consumer products and innovative financial services targeted
at this often neglected segment.

The pyramid shows that:
* half of the world&#x27;s net wealth belongs to the top 1%,
* top 10% of adults hold 85%, while the bottom 90% hold the remaining 15% of the world&#x27;s total wealth,
* top 30% of adults hold 97% of the total wealth.

==== Wealth distribution pyramid in 2020 ====
In 2020, Credit Suisse created an updated wealth pyramid infographic. The infographic was constructed similarly to the pyramid in 2013, thus personal assets were calculated in net worth. In 2020, Credit Suisse estimated that approximately 2.88 billion people (55% of adult population) have wealth below US$10,000. Further, 1.7 billion individuals (38.2% of adult population) have wealth within the range of 10,000 – US$100,000. To continue, 583 million people have wealth within the range of 100,000 – US$1,000,000 and approximately 56 million people (1.1% of adult population) have wealth over US$1,000,000.

==== Comparison of 2013 and 2020 pyramids ====
Vast differences between 2013 and 2020 infographic can be observed. For the first time, more than 1% of all global adults have wealth over US$1,000,000. Credit Suisse explains in the ‘Global Wealth Report 2021’, that this increase reflects the economic disruption caused by the pandemic and disconnect between the improvement in the financial and real assets of households. However, the biggest difference can be seen in the 10,000 – US$100,000 segment. Since 2013, there had been an increase of almost 10% of total adult population. According to Credit Suisse, the number of adults in this segment tripled since 2000. Credit Suisse explains this fact by stating that this increase was a result of growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world. The upper-middle segment, with wealth in a range of 100,000 – US$1,000,000 has increased by 3.4%. Credit Suisse in the report states that the middle class in developed countries typically belong to this group.

=== Wealth outlook for 2020-2025 ===
According to the ‘Global wealth Report 2021’, published by Credit Suisse, global wealth is projected to rise by 39% over the next five years reaching USD 583 trillion by 2025. Wealth per adult is also projected to increase by 31% and so is the number of global millionaires. The wealth pyramid, an infographic used to determine wealth distribution, will also change. The bottom segment covering adults with a net worth below USD 10,000 will likely decrease by approximately 108 million over the next five years. The lower-middle segment of the pyramid containing adults with a net worth in the range of USD 10,000 and USD 100,000 is projected to rise by 237 million adults. Most of these new members are most likely to be from lower-income countries. The upper-middle segment, consisting of adults with wealth between USD 100,000 and USD 1 million is projected to rise by 178 million adults. Most of these new members (approximately 114 million) are likely to come from upper-middle-income countries. Number of global millionaires is also projected to increase. According to the estimates made by Credit Suisse, the number of global millionaires could exceed 84 million by 2025, a rise of almost 28 million from 2020. The increase of millionaires will not only occur in developed countries such as the USA or other developed countries in Europe, but it is also expected to rapidly increase in lower-income countries. The biggest increase is expected in China, with a change of 92.7%, which is about 4.8 million new dollar millionaires. As a consequence, the number of Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWI) with net worth exceeding USD 50 million, will also increase.

=== Gini Coefficient ===
Gini coefficient (or Gini index) is an indicator that is often used to determine wealth inequality. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values, a situation where a single individual has all the income while all others have none. According to the Credit Suisse ‘Global wealth Report 2021’, Brunei had the highest Gini coefficient in 2021 (91.6%), therefore the wealth distribution in Brunei is vastly unequal. Slovakia had the lowest Gini coefficient in 2021 (50.3%) out of all countries, which makes Slovakia the most equal country in terms of wealth distribution. When compared to the report made by Credit Suisse in 2019, an increasing trend of wealth inequality can be observed. This may be the result of repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The biggest increase was recorded in Brazil. The Gini coefficient in 2019 was 88.2% and 89% in 2021, with an increase of 0.8% over this period.

The following table was created from information provided by the Credit Suisse Research Institute&#x27;s &quot;Global Wealth Databook&quot;, Table 3-1, published 2021.



===Geographical distribution===
Wealth is unevenly distributed across different world regions. At the end of the 20th century, wealth was concentrated among the G8 and Western industrialized nations, along with several Asian and OPEC nations. In the 21st century, wealth is still concentrated among the G8 with United States of America leading with 30.2%, along with other developed countries, several Asia-pacific countries and OPEC countries.


====By region====
World distribution of financial wealth.
In 2007, 147 companies controlled nearly 40 percent of the monetary value of all transnational corporations.

=== In the United States ===


According to PolitiFact, in 2011 the 400 wealthiest Americans &quot;have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.&quot; Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a &quot;substantial head start&quot;. In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, &quot;over 60 percent&quot; of the Forbes richest 400 Americans &quot;grew up in substantial privilege&quot;.

In 2007, the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country&#x27;s total wealth (excluding human capital), and the next 19% owned 50.5%. The top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country&#x27;s wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%. From 1922 to 2010, the share of the top 1% varied from 19.7% to 44.2%, the big drop being associated with the drop in the stock market in the late 1970s. Ignoring the period where the stock market was depressed (1976–1980) and the period when the stock market was overvalued (1929), the share of wealth of the richest 1% remained extremely stable, at about a third of the total wealth. Financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%. However, after the Great Recession which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%, further widening the gap between the 1% and the 99%.

Dan Ariely and Michael Norton show in a study (2011) that US citizens across the political spectrum significantly underestimate the current US wealth inequality and would prefer a more egalitarian distribution of wealth, raising questions about ideological disputes over issues like taxation and welfare.


== Wealth concentration ==
Wealth concentration is a process by which created wealth, under some conditions, can become concentrated by individuals or entities. Those who hold wealth have the means to invest in newly created sources and structures of wealth, or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, and are thus the beneficiaries of even greater wealth.

===Economic conditions===

The first necessary condition for the phenomenon of wealth concentration to occur is an unequal initial distribution of wealth. The distribution of wealth throughout the population is often closely approximated by a Pareto distribution, with tails which decay as a power-law in wealth. (See also: Distribution of wealth and Economic inequality). According to PolitiFact and others, the 400 wealthiest Americans had &quot;more wealth than half of all Americans combined.&quot; Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a &quot;substantial head start&quot;. In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, &quot;over 60 percent&quot; of the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 Richest Americans &quot;grew up in substantial privilege&quot;.

The second condition is that a small initial inequality must, over time, widen into a larger inequality. This is an example of positive feedback in an economic system. A team from Jagiellonian University produced statistical model economies showing that wealth condensation can occur whether or not total wealth is growing (if it is not, this implies that the poor could become poorer).

Joseph E. Fargione, Clarence Lehman and Stephen Polasky demonstrated in 2011 that chance alone, combined with the deterministic effects of compounding returns, can lead to unlimited concentration of wealth, such that the percentage of all wealth owned by a few entrepreneurs eventually approaches 100%.

====Correlation between being rich and earning more====
Given an initial condition in which wealth is unevenly distributed (i.e., a &quot;wealth gap&quot;), several non-exclusive economic mechanisms for wealth condensation have been proposed:
* A correlation between being rich and being given high-paid employment (oligarchy).
* A marginal propensity to consume low enough that high incomes are correlated with people who have already made themselves rich (meritocracy).
* The ability of the rich to influence government disproportionately to their favor thereby increasing their wealth (plutocracy).

In the first case, being wealthy gives one the opportunity to earn more through high paid employment (e.g., by going to elite schools). In the second case, having high paid employment gives one the opportunity to become rich (by saving your money). In the case of plutocracy, the wealthy exert power over the legislative process, which enables them to increase the wealth disparity. An example of this is the high cost of political campaigning in some countries, in particular in the US (more generally, see also plutocratic finance).

Because these mechanisms are non-exclusive, it is possible for all three explanations to work together for a compounding effect, increasing wealth concentration even further. Obstacles to restoring wage growth might have more to do with the broader dysfunction of a dollar dominated political system particular to the US than with the role of the extremely wealthy.

Counterbalances to wealth concentration include certain forms of taxation, in particular wealth tax, inheritance tax and progressive taxation of income. However, concentrated wealth does not necessarily inhibit wage growth for ordinary workers with low wages.

The investor, billionaire, and philanthropist Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, voiced in 2005 and once more in 2006 his view that his class, the &quot;rich class&quot;, is waging class warfare on the rest of society. In 2005 Buffet said to CNN: &quot;It&#x27;s class warfare, my class is winning, but they shouldn&#x27;t be.&quot; In a November 2006 interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Buffett stated that &quot;[t]here’s class warfare all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.&quot;

==Redistribution of wealth and public policy==
In many societies, attempts have been made, through property redistribution, taxation, or regulation, to redistribute wealth, sometimes in support of the upper class, and sometimes to diminish economic inequality.

Examples of this practice go back at least to the Roman Republic in the third century B.C., when laws were passed limiting the amount of wealth or land that could be owned by any one family. Motivations for such limitations on wealth include the desire for equality of opportunity, a fear that great wealth leads to political corruption, to the belief that limiting wealth will gain the political favor of a voting bloc, or fear that extreme concentration of wealth results in rebellion. Various forms of socialism attempt to diminish the unequal distribution of wealth and thus the conflicts and social problems arising from it.

During the Age of Reason, Francis Bacon wrote &quot;Above all things good policy is to be used so that the treasures and monies in a state be not gathered into a few hands… Money is like fertilizer, not good except it be spread.&quot;

The rise of Communism as a political movement has partially been attributed to the distribution of wealth under capitalism in which a few lived in luxury while the masses lived in extreme poverty or deprivation. However, in the &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot;, Marx and Engels criticized German Social Democrats for placing emphasis on issues of distribution instead of on production and ownership of productive property. While the ideas of Marx have nominally influenced various states in the 20th century, the Marxist notions of socialism and communism remains elusive.

On the other hand, the combination of labor movements, technology, and social liberalism has diminished extreme poverty in the developed world today, though extremes of wealth and poverty continue in the Third World.

In the Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 from the World Economic Forum the widening income disparities come second as a worldwide risk. According to a 2009 meta-analysis by Paul and Moser, countries with high income inequality and poor unemployment protections experience worse mental health outcomes among the unemployed.

<text>Trần Văn Hương (; 1 December 1902 – 27 January 1982) was a South Vietnamese politician who was the penultimate president of South Vietnam for a week in April 1975 prior to its surrender to the communist forces of North Vietnam. Prior to that, he was prime minister for three months from November 1964 to January 1965 under the supervision of a military junta led by General Nguyen Khanh; during this time, there was widespread civil unrest from the Buddhist majority and power struggles with the military.

==Biography==
Huong was born into a poor Mekong Delta family and given as a baby to foster parents, and later became a schoolteacher. During the First Indochina War, Huong was known for his opposition to both the French Union and the communist-dominated Vietminh that fought against them, and had a reputation for conservatism. He initially joined the Vietminh and led a band of 150 fighters in the Plain of Reeds before leaving as the communists took over. He refused to return to teaching under the French colonial framework and found work in a pharmacy. Known for riding his bicycle around town, he served as mayor of Saigon twice, the first of which was when he agreed to work with newly-appointed Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem in 1954 after the partition of Vietnam, but like Diem, he was known for his inflexibility and the pair fell out several years later.

Later during the rule of Diệm, Hương was jailed in 1960 for three years for signing the Caravelle Manifesto that criticised Diệm. However, after Diệm was overthrown and assassinated in 1963, Hương gave a scathing analysis of the coup generals&#x27; action. He stated that &quot;The top generals who decided to murder Diệm and his brother were scared to death. The generals knew very well that having no talent, no moral virtues, no political support whatsoever, they could not prevent a spectacular comeback of the president and Mr. Nhu if they were alive.&quot;

===First prime ministership===

On 26 September 1964, and due to US pressure, General Nguyễn Khánh and the senior officers in his military junta created a semblance of civilian rule by forming the High National Council (HNC), an appointed advisory body akin to a legislature.

The HNC, selected the aging civilian politician Phan Khắc Sửu as chief of state, and Sửu selected Hương as prime minister, a position that had greater power. However, Khánh and the senior generals retained the real power. At the time, both Saigon and Washington were planning a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam in an attempt to stop support for the Vietcong (VC) insurgency, but were waiting for stability in the south before starting the air strikes. Known for his rigid attitude towards dissent, Hương stated in his first speech upon taking office that &quot;There must be respect for public order, and there must be national discipline&quot; and vowed to &quot;clean and simplify&quot; the government, and engage in &quot;total war&quot; against the communists. He took a firm line against the Buddhists, announcing restrictions on public protests, accusing Thích Trí Quang of being a communist, who in turn charged Hương with being a Diệmist, and responded with mass protests against the new civilian administration, calling for its removal. Huong used the army to break up the demonstrations, resulting in violent confrontations.

Khánh and some younger generals wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power. Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The HNC turned down the request to approve the policy. There was speculation the HNC did this as many of them were old, and therefore did not appreciate the generals&#x27; negativity towards seniors. On 19 December, a Saturday, the generals moved to dissolve the HNC by arresting some of its members. Hương did not speak up initially, but had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the &quot;Young Turks&quot; thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Khánh. The Americans were extremely angry with the generals&#x27; action, and when Ambassador Maxwell Taylor met Hương afterwards, he urged the prime minister to reject the dissolution of the HNC. Hương said he and Suu had not been notified of the moves, but agreed to step in and take over the body&#x27;s work. Taylor nevertheless asked Hương to publicly condemn the coup and call on the army to release those arrested. Hương also said he would be willing to reorganize his administration to meet the wishes of the military, and that retaining their support was essential in keeping a civilian government functional. Taylor said the US did not agree with military rule as a principle, and might reduce aid, but Hương was unmoved and said the Vietnamese people &quot;take a more sentimental than legalistic approach&quot; and that the existence of civilian procedure and the HNC was much less pressing than the &quot;moral prestige of the leaders&quot;.

Later, despite Taylor&#x27;s pleas to keep the dissolution of the HNC secret in the hope it would be reversed, the younger generals called a media conference, where they maintained the HNC had been dissolved in the nation&#x27;s best interests and proclaimed their ongoing confidence for Suu and Hương. Khanh and the younger generals had heated arguments with Taylor in private, before taking their disputes to the media. Defying Taylor earned Khánh heightened approval among his junta colleagues, as the ambassador&#x27;s actions were seen as an insult to the nation. On the night of 23 December, Khánh convinced his fellow officers to join him in lobbying Hương to declare Taylor &quot;persona non grata&quot; and expel him from South Vietnam. They were confident Hương could not reject them and side with a foreign power at the expense of the military that had installed him. Khánh also told Hương that if Taylor was not ejected, he and the other generals would hold a media conference and release &quot;detailed accounts&quot; of the ambassador&#x27;s confrontation with the quartet and his &quot;ultimatum to General Khánh&quot; the day after. However, someone in the junta was a CIA informant and reported the incident, allowing American officials to individually lobby the officers to change their stance. At the same time, the Americans informed Hương if Taylor was expelled, US funding would stop. The next day, the generals changed their mind and when they met Hương at his office, only asked him to formally denounce Taylor&#x27;s behavior in his meetings with Khánh and his quartet and to &quot;take appropriate measures to preserve the honor of all the Vietnamese armed forces and to keep national prestige intact&quot;.

As the generals and Hương were unwilling to reinstate the HNC, Taylor sent General John L. Throckmorton to meet them and mend relations, and the Vietnamese got their way. The South Vietnamese won in large part because the Americans had spent so much on the country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule, as a communist takeover would be a big public relations coup for the Soviet bloc. An anonymous South Vietnamese government official said &quot;Our big advantage over the Americans is that they want to win the war more than we do.&quot; The only concession the military made was on 6 January 1965, when they made a charade move of officially renouncing all their power to Hương, who was asked to organize elections. They also agreed to appoint a civilian body and release those arrested in December. An official announcement was made by Hương and Khánh three days later, in which the military again reiterated their commitment to civilian rule through an elected legislature and a new constitution, and that &quot;all genuine patriots&quot; would be &quot;earnestly assembled&quot; to collaborate in making a plan to defeat the communists.

In January 1965, Hương introduced a series of measures to intensify the anti-communist war effort by expanding military expenditure using aid money and equipment from the Americans, and increasing the size of the armed forces by widening the terms of conscription. This provoked widespread anti-Hương demonstrations and riots across the country, mainly from conscription-aged students and pro-negotiations Buddhists. In Huế, matters degenerated into a riot as 5,000 demonstrators attacked the U.S. Information Service Library and burned 8,000 books. Khánh and I Corps commander General Nguyễn Chánh Thi turned a blind eye to the rioting and destruction of property. It was believed that they did so to allow the disorder to ruin the Hương government and allow them to inherit power. Reliant on Buddhist support, Khánh did little to try to contain the protests. Khánh then decided to have the armed forces take over the government. On 27 January, Khánh removed Hương in a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Air Vice-Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ. He promised to leave politics once the situation was stabilized and hand over power to a civilian body. It was believed that some of the officers supported Khánh&#x27;s increased power so that it would give him an opportunity to fail and be removed permanently. Khánh persisted with the facade of civilian government by retaining figurehead chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu and making economics professor Nguyễn Xuân Oánh the caretaker prime minister.

Khánh&#x27;s deposal of the prime minister nullified a counter-plot involving Hương that had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, Hương had backed a plot led by some Đại Việt-oriented Catholic officers reported to include Generals Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Nguyễn Hữu Có. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiem back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to fully back the move as they regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiem, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for Hương if necessary.

Khánh&#x27;s deposal of Hương further heightened American opposition to him and fears that his reliance on Buddhist support would result in his not taking a hardline position against the communists. Aware that US support for him was further ebbing away, Khánh tried to initiate peace negotiations with the VC, but he only managed an exchange of letters and was yet to organize any meetings or negotiations before he was overthrown. In the meantime, this only intensified US efforts to engineer a coup, and many of Khánh&#x27;s colleagues—mostly Catholic Đại Việt supporters—had by then privately concluded that he was set to pursue a deal with the communists.

Many of whom felt that Khánh thought of himself as the &quot;Sihanouk of Vietnam&quot;; the Cambodian monarch had managed to avoid the Cold War for the time being by shunning both communist and anti-communist blocs. During the first half of February, suspicions and evidence against Khánh began to solidify, an example being his order to release the wife of communist leader Huỳnh Tấn Phát from jail. Taylor&#x27;s superiors in Washington began to align with his view, giving him more scope to agitate for a coup.

===1967 Presidential election===
In the 1967 South Vietnamese presidential election, Hương finished fourth with 474,100 votes (10.0%).

In May 1968, President Thiệu appointed Huong to the post of prime minister, replacing Nguyen Van Loc. After a week of negotiations with Thiệu, Kỳ, various military officers and civilians, Huong assembled a cabinet with representation from a variety of interests but not members of the Đại Việt. Huong mostly favoured technocrats, keeping six of Loc&#x27;s ministers in his 18-man cabinet. Huong also appointed himself the minister for Rural Development and Pacification, and stated upon taking office that &quot;The life and death of this country depend on this government... We will do all we can to safeguard it.&quot;

In March 1969, Huong&#x27;s military-escorted motorcade was taking him home for his lunch break when a man wearing a Vietnamese Rangers uniform approached and fired on a traffic policemen who was organising a clearing for Huong&#x27;s convoy and an abandoned cyclo was pushed into the street. After an exchange of gunfire, Huong&#x27;s convoy sped away and he eventually returned to his office after lunch. The assailant and another suspect were later arrested, and a Claymore mine and plastic explosives were found in the cyclo, which failed to detonate. The disguised Ranger claimed that he been paid USD85 for the assassination attempt, and later confessed to being a communist, although given the factionalism in Saigon politics at the time, some believed that the assassination attempt was ordered by others within the political establishment. VC spokespersons did not comment on the incident.

Huong&#x27;s actual influence was limited, as Thiệu and his military contacts continued to maintain real power. In August 1969, Thiệu replaced him with General Trần Thiện Khiêm. Speculation that Huong would be replaced had been ongoing for a period. The National Assembly had criticised Huong, arguing that his fiscal and anti-corruption policies were ineffective, and Thiệu had not consulted him about policy developments for several months. Huong had also become impaired by asthma and rheumatism by this time.

===Presidency===
On 21 April 1975, Thiệu resigned and handed the presidency to Hương. On 28 April 1975, after one week as president, Hương resigned and handed power over to General Dương Văn Minh, who presided over the surrender of the government two days later.

Hương was placed under house arrest by the North Vietnamese. When deemed adequately reformed in 1977, his civil rights were restored but he declined. Instead, he asked for all officials of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to be released from prison before he would take his place among the freed. His request was ignored. The former president died quietly in his own home in 1982, just 11 months before he was 80. Huong had a wife and two sons.

<text>&quot;Mayor general&quot; Manuel Fernández Castrillón ( – April 21, 1836) was a Mexican Army officer who served during the Texas Revolution. A close friend of President Antonio López de Santa Anna, Castrillón frequently advocated merciful treatment for captured Texian soldiers. He was killed in action at the 1836 Battle of San Jacinto, despite attempts by Thomas Jefferson Rusk to save his life.

==Early life== 
Manuel Fernández Castrillón was born in either Cuba or Spain. Although he was originally a member of a Spanish force attempting to subdue the Mexican rebels during the Mexican War of Independence, Castrillón soon switched sides and served with the Mexican independence forces. He served under Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna in an 1822 battle for Veracruz, and again later as Santa Anna worked to quell various rebellions.

==Texas Revolution==
During the Texas Revolution, Castrillón served as Santa Anna&#x27;s aide-de-camp.

===Battle of the Alamo===
He joined Santa Anna on the 1836 invasion of Texas, which first journeyed to San Antonio de Bexar, and besieged the small Texan force garrisoned at the Alamo. Castrillón often argued against Santa Anna&#x27;s decision to immediately assault the Alamo, advocating instead that the Mexican army wait for the arrival of the heavier cannon that would reduce the Alamo walls to rubble.

On March 6, 1836, during the final assault of the Alamo, Castrillón took command of the Toluca Battalion after Colonel Francisco Duque was wounded. This column attacked the north wall of the Alamo. According to the diary of José Enrique de la Peña, after the Mexican victory at the Battle of the Alamo, Castrillón brought before Santa Anna six or seven Texians who he had taken prisoner during the final Alamo assault. Historian Edmondson speculates that these men may have been sick and unable to participate in the fighting; other historians have theorized that the prisoners may have included Davy Crockett, who Castrillón spared when the final small band of Texians was overwhelmed. Castrillón petitioned that their lives be spared. Santa Anna had stated that no prisoners would be taken and ordered the Texians executed on the spot. Weeks later, during the Goliad Massacre, Fernández Castrillón also protested – in vain – the execution of nearly 400 Texian prisoners, including their leader, James Fannin.

After the Battle of the Alamo, the Mexican army moved east into the more settled areas of Texas.

===Battle of San Jacinto===
Castrillón saw no further fighting until April 21, 1836, when Texas General Sam Houston launched a surprise attack on Mexican forces at the Battle of San Jacinto.

As Texian forces jumped the makeshift barricades surrounding the Mexican army encampment, Castrillón, Santa Anna, and Colonel Juan Almonte all began shouting orders, some contradictory, in the hopes of rallying their troops to mount a defense. Castrillón took charge of the men operating the army&#x27;s single cannon, the &quot;Golden Standard&quot;. Within a few moments, most of the Mexican artillerymen had been killed by Texian riflemen. The surviving troops fled, shouting at Castrillón to join them. According to reports from survivors of the battle, Castrillón shouted back that &quot;I have been in forty battles and never showed my back. I am too old to do it now.&quot; He then turned back to the cannon.

His bravery impressed Thomas J. Rusk, the acting Secretary of the War for the new Republic of Texas government. Rusk rode along the Texian lines, shouting at his men to spare the general. At one point, he knocked aside rifles that were trained on Castrillón. His efforts were in vain; other Texian troops rode straight past Rusk and shot and killed Castrillón. Many Texians held Castrillón as a hero who chose to fight when he could have run. Santa Anna, however, later decried Castrillón as an incompetent fool whose actions led to the Mexican defeat.

Castrillón&#x27;s body was claimed by his friend Lorenzo de Zavala, a member of the Republic of Texas cabinet, and buried in the nearby de Zavala family cemetery.

<doc id="1103835" wikidata="Q143854" url="?curid=1103835" title="Theophilus Presbyter">
<text>Theophilus Presbyter (fl. c. 1070–1125) is the pseudonymous author or compiler of a Latin text containing detailed descriptions of various medieval arts, a text commonly known as the &quot;Schedula diversarum artium&quot; (&quot;List of various arts&quot;) or &quot;De diversis artibus&quot; (&quot;On various arts&quot;), probably first compiled between 1100 and 1120.

== Work ==
The oldest manuscript copies of &quot;De diversis artibus&quot; are found in Vienna (Austrian National Library, Codex 2527) and in Wolfenbüttel (Herzog-August-Bibliothek, Cod. Guelf. Gud. Lat. 69 2°). Gotthold Ephraim Lessing rediscovered the document when he worked as librarian in Wolfenbüttel, and published excerpts in 1774. The work contains perhaps the earliest reference to oil paint, which aroused great interest as the mention disproved Vasari&#x27;s myth of Jan van Eyck developing the technique of oil painting in the early 15th century, about which antiquaries had already become suspicious. It also contains what seems to be the earliest textual evidence for wire-making using a draw plate.

Theophilus&#x27; &quot;Schedula&quot; allows detailed insights into the techniques used in the applied arts in the high Middle Ages. The work is divided into three books. The first covers the production and use of painting and drawing materials (painting techniques, paints, and ink), especially for illumination of texts and painting of walls. The second deals with the production of stained glass and techniques of glass painting, while the last deals with various techniques of goldsmithing and other metalwork. It also includes an introduction into the building of organs. 

The First Book, on painting, is not particularly well-informed, but adequately reliable, the Second, on glass, is better, while most of the Third Book is clearly the work of a practising metalworker. It has recently been suggested that the apparent contradictory evidence as to dating, practical experience, and location of &#x27;Theophilus&#x27; is best explained if the &quot;Schedula&quot; is understood to be a compilation.

The work has been translated into English, French, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Hungarian, German, Italian, Japanese, Bulgarian, and Russian, mostly in the 19th and 20th centuries.

== Biography ==
&#x27;Theophilus&#x27; was quite possibly a Benedictine monk. It has been suggested (particularly by ) that Theophilus is the same person as the artisan monk Roger of Helmarshausen. Roger appears to have come from Stavelot Abbey in the Meuse River region, was active as an artist and author between 1100 and 1107 in St. Pantaleon&#x27;s church in Cologne, and moved to Helmarshausen Abbey in 1107. The identity of the two men has been argued among researchers for some time, but Freise&#x27;s conclusions have not yet been accepted by all researchers. Other suggestions have also been made, and at present there can not be said to be a consensus.

==Editions and translations==

<text>This page provides links to alphabetized lists of notable Freemasons. Freemasonry is a fraternal organisation which exists in a number of forms worldwide. Throughout history some members of the fraternity have made no secret of their involvement, while others have not made their membership public. In some cases, membership can only be proven by searching through the fraternity&#x27;s records. Such records are most often kept at the individual lodge level, and may be lost due to fire, flood, deterioration, or simple carelessness. Grand Lodge governance may have shifted or reorganized, resulting in further loss of records on the member or the name, number, location or even existence of the lodge in question. In areas of the world where Masonry has been suppressed by governments, records of entire grand lodges have been destroyed. Because of this, masonic membership can sometimes be difficult to verify.

<doc id="1103851" wikidata="Q766669" url="?curid=1103851" title="Railway Rivals">
<text>Railway Rivals is a railroad-themed board game that was originally published by Rostherne Games in 1973. A German language edition was released by Bütehorn in 1979, and a mass-market edition in the UK by Games Workshop in 1985. The game involves railway building and operations.

== Description ==
&quot;Railway Rivals&quot; is a boardgame for 2–6 players, in which each is a railway owner, and is striving to build track in order to join up cities and deliver profitable loads.

== Gameplay ==
The game is in two stages; in the first part players draw tracks on the card using washable finetip pens (allowing the board to be cleaned for reuse). Players have a building allowance each turn; building through difficult terrain costs more moves. Players earn money for connecting cities to their railway network, and pay other players for connecting to or building alongside their track.

Once all cities are joined by railway tracks, the second part of the game starts. Players race their trains along the tracks between randomly chosen pairs of cities; just as in real life, players must pay other players to use elements of their track if they don&#x27;t have a complete route of their own. The choice of routes raced is random; each city is used one or more times. Money is awarded to the trains that arrive first and second, and the player with the most money when all routes have been raced is the winner.

== Maps ==
Initially, the towns on the maps were indexed by the 36 numbers 11–66, allowing a town to be randomly generated by rolling two standard dice. Some towns could have more than one index number associated with them; for example, on maps that included London, it was usual for London to have 4 or even 6 index numbers to reflect its size. As Watts&#x27; experience increased, map design got more complex. It became standard for a map to have six &quot;special runs&quot; to destinations at the edges of the map, or special classes of town (for example, sea ports). In redesigns of some early maps, valleys were widened, to make it easier for more than one player to have a route along them. The building cost of going into or out of a hill was also reduced, again increasing competition for previously secure groups of towns.

The first digit of a town&#x27;s number was considered its &quot;sector&quot; and in postal games GMs would ensure that in the racing phase each sector would see one race to each other sector and one to a special run, to ensure a uniform distribution of the races. In the game&#x27;s late-1980s and early-1990s heyday, Watts appeared to target a more &quot;gamer&quot; than &quot;family&quot; audience, producing maps on larger hex sheets and with 52 towns indexed by cards rather than the 42 given by the towns + special runs. This led to games taking longer to complete; this appears to have been unpopular with the market, as from 1992 on new map designs in general went back to having 36 towns + special runs and using smaller hex sheets. At this point Watts began to make more use of &quot;small towns&quot;, towns which shared their index number with one other town and only scored 3 points rather than 6 for the first player to connect to them; this seems to have been a compromise to allow him to encourage the development of historically occurring tracks without lengthening the game.

The original maps are now out of print. Nevertheless, hundreds of after-market maps have been developed for &quot;Railway Rivals&quot; (including one for Middle-earth), and they can be developed straightforwardly by enthusiasts. The results of games of &quot;Railway Rivals&quot; can be compared with the way that real railways developed in a particular area.

== Publication history ==
David Watts, a geography teacher, originally developed the game as a teaching aid to help students become familiar with the geography of industrialized countries and to demonstrate how geography and competition had resulted in railways being developed in some places but not others. He self-published the game through his own company, Rostherne Games, initially in kit form (hex sheets and colouring instructions) for several years before it was released in a boxed set by Fairmount Simulation Gaming. Watts also sold many individual laminated paper maps covering specific areas of England, Scotland, and India, together with brief instructions and the special dice required.

The German games company Bütehorn published a German-language edition in 1979 titled &quot;Dampfross&quot; (&quot;Steam Steed&quot;), and it was given a &quot;Recommended&quot; citation at Spiel des Jahres 1980. The game only sold 1,000 copies, and Bütehorn went bankrupt. Schmidt Spiele acquired the German-language license and Knut-Michael Wolf completely revised the rules. The new edition was released in 1983, and subsequently won the Spiel des Jahres in 1984, resulting in some complaints, since only new game releases are considered; the jury ruled that Schmidt&#x27;s rules revisions so completely altered the game that the new edition was, in effect, a new game. &quot;Dampfross&quot; proved enormously popular, selling over 300,000 copies.

Following this success, Games Workshop published a UK edition of &quot;Railway Rivals&quot;, with a game board made of laminated card, and a map of Central England on one side and the Western USA on the other. Pens, dice and small plastic trains were also included.

Schmidt Spiele marketed several foreigh-language versions in other countries including a Dutch version, &quot;Tussen de Rails&quot; for Selecta Spel en Hobby, and a Swedish version, &quot;Rail&quot;, for Alga.

In 1992, a revised version of &quot;Dampfross&quot; was published by Laurin-Verlag; after Laurin was taken over in 1993, Queen Games continued to publish it.

In 1998 Watts sold the rights to all Rostherne Games to Theo Clarke.

==Reception==
In Issue 35 of the UK magazine &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot;, John Deans commented, &quot;It is a natural consequence of a completed game for players to compare their network with that actually in existence. Where the two coincide there is a certain satisfaction in &#x27;being right&#x27; and where they do not discussion can arise of value in the developing of the players&#x27; grasp of this aspect of Geography. For this is the object of the &quot;Railway Rivals&quot; game and, while providing entertainment and excitement, they seem to succeed in this.&quot; Deans concluded by giving the game a rating of 4 out of 6. 

In Issue 10 of &quot;Perfidious Albion&quot;, Charles Vasey reviewed the game variant set in Ireland and thought it was &quot;a simple and accurate game which is good fun for all ages (it might not be a wargame but blood still flows!)&quot; Vasey questioned the game&#x27;s balance, since the west coast of Ireland was not very industrialized. Nonetheless, Vasey concluded, &quot;though simple, the game often achieves the same results as occurred in real life. Fun.&quot; 

In 1984, Brian Cresse reviewed the postal version of &quot;Railway Rivals&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;&quot;Railway Rivals&quot; is, deservedly, one of the most popular postal games around, but has failed to gain an equivalent hold on the &#x27;mass&#x27; of the games-playing public.&quot;

Writing in Issue 78 of &quot;Games&quot; (August 1986), Sid Sackson called it a &quot;captivating railway game.&quot; Although Sackson noted the game can be played by two, &quot;more is definitely merrier.&quot;

&quot;Games&quot; named &quot;Railway Rivals&quot; one of the Top 100 Games of 1986. 

In Issue 33 of the French games magazine &quot;Casus Belli&quot;, Hal Héretour and J.M. Rubio Nevado pointed out that strategies for the two phases of the game were oppositional, saying, &quot;The winner is always the one who has been able to reconcile the imperatives of the two phases. [In the first phase] we must build an effective network at the lowest cost for the rest of the game ... the second phase decides the fate of the game. You must carefully balance the price of the race, to be paid to your opponents, and the chances of success.&quot; Héretour and Nevado concluded on a positive note, writing, &quot;&quot;Railway Rivals&quot; is a clear game (only four pages of rules), tactically very rich with twists and turns, with some hints of diplomacy. The more players, the better; nevertheless it is a fun game for two.&quot;

Rick Heli, writing for &quot;Spotlight on Games&quot;, called it &quot;a rather satisfying game&quot; and rated it 7 out of 10.

<doc id="1103861" wikidata="Q7449245" url="?curid=1103861" title="Semester at Sea">
<text>Semester at Sea (SaS) is a study-abroad program founded in 1963 and managed by the Institute for Shipboard Education (ISE) in Fort Collins, Colorado. Colorado State University is the current academic sponsor and the program is conducted on a cruise ship. Nearly 73,000 undergraduate students from over 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea.

During the spring and fall semesters, up to 600 undergraduates participate in the 100- to 110-day program. During the semester the ship circumnavigates the globe, traveling from North America east (across the Atlantic) or west (across the Pacific) and visiting 10 to 11 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, and North America. Although the program had voyages through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, piracy concerns in the Gulf of Aden have changed a typical voyage to around Africa.

==History==

The program was founded in 1963 and is managed by the Institute for Shipboard Education (ISE). ISE had hosted a summer, 65-day Semester at Sea program that focused on one region of the world. In May 2011, SaS introduced a 26-day Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the United Nations&#x27; Millennium Development Goals. The Maymester voyage offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. But after the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea canceled the short-term voyages due to low enrollment. A two-week, December–January Enrichment Voyage for continuing education participants was also canceled. The voyages&#x27; itineraries focused on Central and South America, often transiting the Panama Canal or traveling up the Amazon River.

=== Before 2000 ===
A student died in a 1993 hiking accident, and five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India in spring 1996. The spring 1994 voyage (on the SS &quot;Universe&quot;) ended in Hong Kong because the ship was scheduled for dry-dock maintenance after the voyage. However, the ship was unable to adhere to its sailing schedule during the semester due to mechanical difficulties. It made several unscheduled stops, and had to anchor between ports while repairs were made. The ship was towed to the South China Sea and anchored overnight, guarded by crew members against piracy. A planned stop at Manila was canceled, and the &quot;Universe&quot; was rerouted to Singapore. Examinations were completed at anchor in the harbor, and the students and faculty were flown to the next two planned ports (Osaka and Shanghai). In Shanghai, the &quot;Universe&quot; met the students for the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.

1997&#x27;s fall voyage was rerouted due to terrorism concerns. Ramzi Yousef was convicted of masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing on November 12 of that year, and the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. The Luxor massacre occurred five days later, while the ship was docked in Port Said and the students were in Egypt. Although no students were involved, fears of terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports (Israel and Turkey) from the itinerary and the ship was rerouted to Cyprus and Spain.

=== 2000–2009 ===
Two incidents occurred during the fall 2000 semester on the SS &quot;Universe Explorer&quot;. Entering Vietnam, the ship was struck by a barge; its hull was damaged, and student rooms were closed. The &quot;Universe Explorer&quot; remained an extra day in Vietnam for repairs. Preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship&#x27;s captain decided to reroute due to threats to ships in the Suez region; the voyage instead stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.

After the September 11 attacks, the &quot;Universe Explorer&quot; was redirected after its stop in Kobe. The planned route, from Penang and the Indian Ocean through the Suez Canal to ports in Egypt and Croatia, was changed by the U.S. State Department to include Singapore, Seychelles, and Cape Town. On the Indian Ocean, the ship&#x27;s communication with other vessels was limited to protect the American citizens on board.

On January 26, 2005, the MV &quot;Explorer&quot; weathered a combination of three storms in the North Pacific. A freak wave smashed the bridge&#x27;s windows, breaking one of them and briefly affecting the ship&#x27;s navigation systems. The U.S. Coast Guard dispatched a Lockheed HC-130 search-and-rescue plane and two cutters after receiving a distress call from the ship. Two crew members were injured during the incident. While the ship was repaired in Honolulu, the students were flown to Hong Kong to continue their courses. The &quot;Explorer&quot; rejoined them in Ho Chi Minh City and completed the semester. Later that year, the University of Pittsburgh ended its 24-year academic sponsorship of the program, citing safety concerns.

2005&#x27;s summer voyage was rerouted from London to Le Havre due to safety concerns after the July 7 London bombings. During the fall 2006 voyage, Typhoon Shanshan caused the MV &quot;Explorer&quot; (en route from Japan to Qingdao, China) to be rerouted to Hong Kong. The summer 2008 voyage was rerouted from Istanbul to Alexandria due to bomb threats in Turkey. That fall, a University of Wisconsin student was struck and killed by a drunk driver in Hong Kong. The spring and fall 2009 itineraries were altered to avoid Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden.

=== 2010–2019 ===
During the fall 2010 voyage, a University of California, Santa Barbara student died while the ship was docked in Ho Chi Minh City. The spring 2011 itinerary was changed after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the MV &quot;Explorer&quot; docked in Taiwan.

During the fall 2012 voyage, a University of Virginia student died in a recreational-boating accident while the ship was docked in Roseau, Dominica. The fall 2014 voyage was rerouted from Senegal and Ghana to Italy and Spain due to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Department warnings about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and later voyages were also rescheduled. The MS &quot;World Odyssey&quot; fall 2015 trip was rerouted from Turkey to Croatia to avoid terrorism and the refugee crisis.

The fall 2017 voyage was rerouted from Mauritius at the vessel owner&#x27;s request, and the ship went from India to South Africa. On November 7, 2017, in Bagan, Myanmar, a St. Edward&#x27;s University student was fatally injured in a fall from a pagoda.

=== Spring 2020===
The Spring 2020 voyage avoided a number of countries (including China) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The students, faculty, staff, and Lifelong Learners aboard the MV &quot;World Odyssey&quot; were rerouted to Vietnam for an extra week to make up for lost time in China. The &quot;World Odyssey&quot; left Kobe as scheduled on January 28, arriving in Ho Chi Minh City on February 4. The ship left Ho Chi Minh City three hours late. The original itinerary had the &quot;World Odyssey&quot; stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. After a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the &quot;World Odyssey&quot; attempted to reroute to Victoria, Seychelles, with an expected arrival on February 27 and departure on March 1. But the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The &quot;World Odyssey&quot; then headed south to Mauritius, and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day in port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability; it then returned to dock in Port Louis on March 3–7. The morning of March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to quarantine concerns when arriving at European ports from North Africa. SAS concluded the Spring 2020 voyage, canceling all South Africa-related programming on March 12, and advised students to return home from Cape Town in light of a U.S. State Department worldwide travel advisory. All students were required to disembark from the &quot;World Odyssey&quot; between March 14 and March 16, were provided with resources to help them travel home, and completed the academic program remotely from March 17 to April 20.

=== Fall 2020 ===
On May 12, 2020, Semester at Sea announced that the Fall 2020 voyage would not be sailing as planned because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The modified itinerary was scheduled to begin with an online program and continue with a condensed voyage beginning in late October. Voyagers were scheduled to embark in Tenerife, Canary Islands, sail on to Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, Colombia, Panama Canal Transit, Ecuador, and Easter Island (Chile), with final disembarkation taking place in Puntarenas, Costa Rica.

== Academics ==
Students attend classes in a number of subjects and disciplines, including humanities courses relevant to one (or more) of the countries on the itinerary, while the ship is at sea. All students are required to take an interdisciplinary, core global-studies course. Although Colorado State University is the program&#x27;s academic sponsor, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world.

No classes are taught in port, and students can take Semester at Sea-sponsored trips or travel independently in the port country. Before arriving at a port, they are briefed on the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. At the port of call, guest speakers (including community leaders and American ambassadors) deliver lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and guest lectures are intended to prepare students for their stay in the country.

=== Lecturers and guests ===
Notable lecturers and guests have included:
*Corazon Aquino
*Fidel Castro
*Tung Chee-hwa
*Arthur C. Clarke
*Fahd of Saudi Arabia
*Indira Gandhi
*Mikhail Gorbachev
*Nelson Mandela
*Mohammed VI of Morocco
*Paul Muldoon
*Pete Peterson
*Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco
*Anwar Sadat
*Desmond Tutu
*Mother Teresa

== Ships ==

A lease was announced in May 2015 for the ship previously known as the to be renovated, re-flagged and renamed the , operated by V-Ships. 

Semester at Sea has used a number of ships as its floating campus, including the MS &quot;Seven Seas&quot; (formerly the USS &quot;Long Island&quot;), the SS &quot;Ryndam&quot; (not the later freighter of that name), the SS &quot;Universe&quot; (formerly the SS Atlantic), the and the . The SS &quot;Seawise University&quot; (formerly the RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;), which SaS intended to use, burned and sank in 1972 in Hong Kong Harbour during her conversion into a floating campus. The &quot;Universe Explorer&quot;, which retired in 2005, had four main decks and a small swimming pool at the stern of the ship. The &quot;Seawise University&quot;, &quot;Universe&quot;, and &quot;Universe Explorer&quot; were supplied and managed by Tung Chao Yung&#x27;s Seawise Foundation. Concerns about the separation of the Institute for Shipboard Education and the Seawise Foundation and the safety of the MV &quot;Explorer&quot; contributed to the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s severing ties to the program in 2005.

== Ports of call ==
The program itinerary differs each semester, and the ship typically docks at 10 or 11 ports. An early-1990s spring itinerary included Nassau, Caracas, Salvador (Brazil), Cape Town, Mombasa, Chennai, Singapore, Shanghai, Osaka and Hong Kong. More recent voyages have explored Hawaii, Japan, China, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, Mauritius, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco, and the Netherlands. The fall 2019 itinerary included the Netherlands, Poland, the Kiel Canal, Portugal, Spain, Croatia, Morocco, Ghana, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, the Panama Canal, Ecuador and Costa Rica. The Summer of 2012 voyage aboard the MV Explorer included Spain, Italy, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Morocco, and Portugal. Denmark was a port of call in summer 2008, Namibia in fall 2008, Bulgaria in summer 2009 and Senegal in fall 2015 (the program&#x27;s first visits to those countries).
 Semester at Sea had one summer voyage in 1996. The ship left from Ensenada, Mexico and spent two months in the South Pacific, stopping in Papeete, Tahiti; Auckland, New Zealand; Sydney, Australia; Suva, Fiji; Apia, Western Samoa; and Hilo, Hawaii before ending the voyage in Seattle, Washington.

<text>Ferdinand Ries (baptised 28 November 1784 – 13 January 1838) was a German composer. Ries was a friend, pupil and secretary of Ludwig van Beethoven. He composed eight symphonies, a violin concerto, nine piano concertos (the first concerto is not published), three operas, and numerous other works, including 26 string quartets. In 1838 he published a collection of reminiscences of his teacher Beethoven, co-written with Beethoven&#x27;s 
friend, Franz Wegeler. Ries&#x27; symphonies, some chamber works—most of them with piano—his violin concerto and his piano concertos have been recorded, exhibiting a style which, given his connection to Beethoven, lies between the Classical and early Romantic styles.

== Early life ==
Ries was born into a musical family of Bonn. His grandfather, Johann Ries (1723–1784), was appointed court trumpeter to the Elector of Cologne at Bonn. Ries was the eldest son of the violinist and Archbishopric Music Director Franz Anton Ries (1755–1846) and the brother of violinist and composer (Pieter) Hubert Ries (1802–1886) and violinist Joseph Ries. He received piano lessons from his father and was instructed by Bernhard Romberg, who also belonged to the Bonn Hofkapelle as a cellist. At the end of 1798 he went for further training in Arnsberg to meet an organist friend of his father; a year later he went to Munich. There he worked hard as a music copyist.

The French dissolved the Electoral court of Bonn and disbanded its orchestra, but in the early months of 1803 the penniless Ries managed to reach Vienna, with a letter of introduction written by the Munich-based composer Carl Cannabich on 29 December 1802. Ries was then the pupil of Ludwig van Beethoven, who had received some early instruction at Bonn from Ries&#x27;s father, Franz Ries. Together with Carl Czerny, Ries was the only pupil whom Beethoven taught during these years. Beethoven took great care of the young man, teaching him piano, sending him to Albrechtsberger for harmony and composition and securing for him positions as piano tutor in aristocratic households in Baden and Silesia. 
Ries was soon also Beethoven&#x27;s secretary: he had correspondence with publishers, copied notes, completed errands and provided Beethoven the beautiful apartment in the Pasqualati House where the composer lived for several years. Ries made his public debut as a pianist in July 1804, playing Beethoven&#x27;s C minor concerto, Op. 37, with his own cadenza, which he was allowed to write. His performance received glowing reviews. Ries spent the summers of 1803 and 1804 with Beethoven in Baden bei Wien, as well as in Döbling.

Ries&#x27; work as a secretary and a copyist won Beethoven&#x27;s confidence in negotiations with publishers and he became a fast friend. One of the most famous stories told about Ries is connected with the first rehearsal of the Eroica Symphony, when Ries, during the performance, mistakenly believed that the horn player had come in too early and said so aloud, infuriating Beethoven.

Ries feared conscription in the occupying French army (though he was blind in one eye) and so he fled Vienna in September 1805. He stayed in Bonn for a year with his family, and this is where he wrote his first piano concerto in C major, now known as Concerto no. 6 for piano and orchestra. While Ries was living in Bonn, his two piano sonatas, op. 1, dedicated to Beethoven were published by Simrock.

Starting in 1807, Ries spent the next two years in Paris before returning to Vienna. Here Ries quickly expanded his catalogue of works (mainly to chamber and piano music, such as the later popular Septet op. 25). Ries had great difficulty succeeding in the capital city of the French Army and was at times so discouraged that he wanted to give up the profession of music and seek a position in the civil service.

On 27 August 1808, Ries arrived back in Vienna, where he again made contact with Beethoven. Ries helped Beethoven with the premieres of the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and other works for the benefit concert held on 22 December 1808. In July 1809, Ries left Vienna for the second time; this time he was threatened by the call-up to the Austrian military, which mobilized all forces against the threat to Vienna by Napoleon. Again he took refuge in his paternal home of Bonn and spent the next one and a half years composing a series of larger works: his first Symphony, his second Piano Concerto in C minor (later known as Concerto no. 4 op. 115) and his Violin Concerto (unpublished during his lifetime) in E minor op. 24.

==Later life==
In January 1811, Ries left for Russia with the goal of an extended concert trip via Kassel, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Stockholm to St. Petersburg. There, he met his old teacher Bernhard Romberg, with whom he played concerts in Western Russia. He composed two piano concertos for this tour, No. 2 in E flat major, op. 42 and No. 3 in C sharp minor, op. 55. However, in the summer of 1812, with Napoleon advancing on Moscow, Ries left Russia to tour across Europe, arriving in London in April 1813.

The composer&#x27;s next eleven years were spent in England. Johann Peter Salomon, a friend and patron of Haydn—who had formerly played with Franz Anton Ries in the court orchestra at Bonn—included Ries regularly in his Philharmonic concert series, where a review praised his &quot;romantic wildness&quot;. In London too, Ries established himself as a respected piano teacher in the wealthy districts of the city and in 1814 he married Harriet Mangeon (1796–1863), from an opulent family. In 1815 he became a member of the Philharmonic Society and in the same year was elected to be one of its directors. In 1818 he was a founding member of the Regent’s Harmonic Institution; a music publishing firm established with the intent of raising funds for the Philharmonic Society and its restoration of the Argyll Rooms. Ries never lost touch with Beethoven and had a role in the London publications of many works of Beethoven after the peace of 1815, including the 1822 commission from the Philharmonic Society that resulted in the Choral Symphony.
Ries wrote his Symphony No. 2 in D minor (numbered as no. 5), inspired by the quality of the Orchestra of the Philharmonic Society. His compositional work is effectively split in two at this time. Ries composed most of his orchestral works during his time in London: six of his eight symphonies (as well as two of his five concert overtures) were created for concerts of the Philharmonic Society. On the other hand, he wrote now increasingly light fare for the piano: fantasies, rondos, variations, adapted divertimentos and others, mostly about well-known opera arias or popular folk song melodies. The production of chamber music (string quartets, violin sonatas) and intermediate piano music (sonatas) came almost to a standstill. After 1820, he had disagreements with his fellow directors of the Philharmonic Society; Ries was of the opinion that his works were not adequately taken into account in the programming of concerts. In 1821, he resigned his position of Director and began to increase his contacts with continental Europe with the idea of a return. On 3 May 1824, he gave his farewell concert in London, at which he dedicated a Piano Concerto (Concerto no. 7 in A minor for piano and orchestra op. 132).

In July 1824, Ries retired to Germany with his English wife and three children, but returned to musical life in Frankfurt am Main as composer and conductor. His reputation as an instrumental composer and bandleader had strengthened now in Central Europe. In 1834 he was appointed head of the city orchestra and &quot;Singakademie&quot; in Aachen, for which he wrote two oratorios, &quot;Der Sieg des Glaubens&quot; (1829) and &quot;Die Könige in Israel&quot; (1837), both of which have been recorded. In addition, he was festival director of the Lower Rhenish Music Festival eight times — between 1824 and 1837. During his first year as director of the festival, Ries conducted the German premiere of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony. In Godesburg during 1825 and 1826, Ries wrote five string quartets (op. 150, no. 1–2; op. 166, no. 1; WoO 34 and 36).

Beginning in April 1827, the Ries family moved to Frankfurt am Main. In Frankfurt, the existence of a renowned Opera House attracted him. Since 1826, he had had plans to write operas, which he brought to fruition in the years 1827/28. On 15 October 1828, his first opera, &quot;The Robber Bride&quot;, was premiered in Frankfurt with great success. To the direction of the Dublin Music Festival in 1831 he used a month&#x27;s stay in London, where he composed his second opera, &quot;The Sorceress&quot; (published in Germany under the title &quot;Liska or the Witch by Gyllensteen&quot;). It was premiered on 4 August 1831 at the London Royal Adelphi Theatre. His third opera was composed in 1834 (&quot;Die Nacht auf dem Libanon&quot; WoO 51), which for many years remained unperformed. In 1832/33 Ries and his wife made a several-month journey through Italy for a concert tour (which would be his last), with concerts in Venice, Milan, Rome and Naples. During the trip, Ries wrote his final Piano Concerto (in G minor op. 177), his final Piano Sonata (A flat major op. 176) and his final String Quartet (F minor WoO 48, during his lifetime, unpublished). In the summer of 1834, Ries was briefly Director of the Aachen Theatre Orchestra in conversation; but he rejected the offer. During the winter of 1836-37 Ries visited Paris; while there, he composed his last work for orchestra (the overture dramatique &quot;L&#x27;apparition&quot; WoO 61) and briefly went to London, where he succeeded in the world premiere of his new overture in a concert of the Philharmonic Society on 13 March 1837. Ries returned to Frankfurt where he died on 13 January 1838, after a short and unexpected illness. When Ries died, he was so forgotten that no leading music magazine wrote an obituary for him.

Ferdinand Ries is buried in the Tomb (No. 45) of the Klotz family in the Frankfurt am Main cemetery.

==The music==

Cecil Hill wrote a scholarly thematic catalog, listed below, of Ries&#x27;s 300 works: for each work he provided incipits (opening themes) for each movement, dedications, known early reviews, and known dates of composition.

While one of the few widely circulated recordings of Ries&#x27;s music was for some time that of his third piano concerto, now all of his symphonies, the other concertos, and a number of chamber works are available on compact disc, and his surviving music for piano and orchestra and chamber works are the focus of ongoing projects on various record labels as well.

<text>Seventh Son (1987) is an alternate history/fantasy novel by American writer Orson Scott Card. It is the first book in Card&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; series and is about Alvin Miller, the seventh son of a seventh son. &quot;Seventh Son&quot; won a Locus Award and was nominated for both the Hugo and World Fantasy Awards in 1988. Seventh sons have strong &quot;knacks&quot; (specific magical abilities), and seventh sons of seventh sons are both extraordinarily rare and powerful. In fact, young Alvin appears to be the only one in the world. His abilities make him the target of the Unmaker, who recognizes Alvin&#x27;s powers as those of a Maker, only the second ever, and it had been a long time since the first had walked on water and turned water to wine. The Unmaker works largely by water and tries to kill Alvin in his early years before he can master his abilities.

==Plot summary==
Alvin&#x27;s family is migrating west. When they try to cross the Hatrack River, an unknown force, known as the Unmaker, tries to stop the still-unborn Alvin from being born since Alvin would be the seventh son of a seventh son and therefore have incredible powers as a Maker. The force sends a tree down the river to crush the wagon the pregnant Mrs. Miller is riding in. Her eldest son, Vigor, diverts the tree but is mortally wounded in the act. Because a seventh son must be born while the other six are alive, Vigor desperately clings to life until Alvin is born.

Help is dispatched at the insistence of five-year-old &quot;torch&quot; (a person who, among other things, can see the life forces of people and, under certain conditions, their myriad alternate futures) Peggy Guester, who sees Alvin and Alvin&#x27;s possible future as a Maker.

As the years pass, Alvin avoids numerous attempts of an unknown force trying to kill him and us often helped by the intervention of a mysterious protector. Alvin&#x27;s father, a nonbeliever in God, believes that a water spirit is trying to kill Alvin. When Alvin is seven, a new Reverend, named Thrower, arrives in town and tries to build a church. Alvin&#x27;s father refuses to help, but Mrs. Miller has all of her sons work on building the church. When the ridgebeam is being placed onto the church in construction, it shivers and breaks and seems about to fall on Alvin. However, mid-air, it breaks in two and misses Alvin, which is yet another example of Alvin&#x27;s near-death experiences. When Alvin goes home, he provokes one of his sisters by poking her and so they get revenge on Alvin by putting needles into his night gown. Alvin avenges himself by using his knack to send cockroaches after his sisters. The plan works, and Alvin has a victory over his sisters. However, he then has a vision that he dubs Shining Man, who makes him promise to use his knack only for good.

When Alvin is ten, &quot;Taleswapper&quot; (William Blake), a traveling storyteller, arrives in the town that Alvin&#x27;s parents have founded. After stopping by the house of Alvin&#x27;s brother-in-law, who directs Taleswapper to the Miller house, he visits the church and notices that its altar has been touched upon by an evil entity. Reverend Thrower kicks him out, and Taleswapper goes to the Millers&#x27; place, where his timely intervention stops Mr. Miller from killing Alvin. Taleswapper is welcomed in and helps to put a name to the unknown force that tries to stop Alvin from realizing his true powers as a Maker: the Unmaker. Meanwhile, the Reverend Philadelphia Thrower becomes a tool of the Unmaker, the evil force that touched the altar.

Soon, the Miller family goes to a quarry to cut out a millstone. Here, one of Alvin&#x27;s knacks is revealed since he singlehandedly cuts the millstone through hard rock. During the night, Taleswapper and Mr. Miller guard the millstone. Mr. Miller tells Taleswapper a story about how a force is trying to use him to kill Alvin. Taleswapper advises Mr. Miller to send Alvin away to somewhere he may be safe. The next day, the millstone is taken home. The Unmaker finally manages to injure Alvin by making a millstone fall on him. Taleswapper encourages him to heal himself. Alvin does so but finds that he cannot heal himself part of his bone. He realizes that he might need outside help to heal. Reverend Thrower, acting as a surgeon, attempts to kill him but finds himself blocked by a mysterious force. Alvin heals himself with the aid of his brother Measure, who performs the surgery. Alvin is contracted as an apprentice to a blacksmith in the town on the Hatrack River in which he was born.

Taleswapper meets Peggy. It is revealed that she, using her torch powers and Alvin&#x27;s birth caul, had protected Alvin all of those years, and the Unmaker hurt Alvin with the millstone only because Alvin himself overrode her powers.

The book&#x27;s sequel, which is second in the tales of Alvin&#x27;s life, is &quot;Red Prophet&quot;.

<doc id="1103866" wikidata="Q3031135" url="?curid=1103866" title="History of Chicago">
<text>Chicago has played a central role in American economic, cultural and political history. Since the 1850s Chicago has been one of the dominant metropolises in the Midwestern United States, and has been the largest city in the Midwest since the 1880 census. The area&#x27;s recorded history begins with the arrival of French explorers, missionaries and fur traders in the late 17th century and their interaction with the local Potawatomi Native Americans. Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a black freeman, was the first permanent non-indigenous settler in the area, having a house at the mouth of the Chicago River by at least 1790, though possibly as early as 1784. The small settlement was defended by Fort Dearborn after its completion in 1804, but was abandoned as part of the War of 1812 in expectation of an attack by the Potawatomi, who caught up with the retreating soldiers and civilians not two miles south of the fort. The modern city was incorporated in 1837 by Northern businessmen and grew rapidly from real estate speculation and the realization that it had a commanding position in the emerging inland transportation network, based on lake traffic and railroads, controlling access from the Great Lakes into the Mississippi River basin.

Despite a fire in 1871 that destroyed the Central Business District, the city grew exponentially, becoming the nation&#x27;s rail center and the dominant Midwestern center for manufacturing, commerce, finance, higher education, religion, broadcasting, sports, jazz, and high culture. The city was a magnet for European immigrants—at first Germans, Irish and Scandinavians, then from the 1890s to 1914, Jews, Czechs, Poles and Italians. They were all absorbed in the city&#x27;s powerful ward-based political machines. Many joined militant labor unions, and Chicago became notorious for its violent strikes, but respected for its high wages.

Large numbers of African Americans migrated from the South starting in the World War I era as part of the Great Migration. Mexicans started arriving after 1910, and Puerto Ricans after 1945. The Cook County suburbs grew rapidly after 1945, but the Democratic party machine kept both the city and suburbs under control, especially under mayor Richard J. Daley, who was chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party. Deindustrialization after 1970 closed the stockyards and most of the steel mills and factories, but the city retained its role as a financial and transportation hub. Increasingly it emphasized its service roles in medicine, higher education, and tourism. The city formed the political base for leaders such as Stephen A. Douglas in the 1850s, Adlai Stevenson in the 1950s, and Barack Obama in recent years.

==Pre-1830==
=== Early native settlements ===
At its first appearance in records by explorers, the Chicago area was inhabited by a number of Algonquian peoples, including the Mascouten and Miami. The name &quot;Chicago&quot; is generally believed to derive from a French rendering of the Miami–Illinois language word &quot;šikaakwa&quot;, referring to the plant &quot;Allium tricoccum&quot;, as well as the animal skunk. The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as &quot;Checagou&quot; was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir. Henri Joutel, in his journal of 1688, noted that the wild garlic, called &quot;chicagoua&quot;, grew abundantly in the area. According to his diary of late September 1687:

The tribe was part of the Miami Confederacy, which included the Illini and Kickapoo. In 1671, Potawatomi guides first took the French trader Nicolas Perrot to the Miami villages near the site of present-day Chicago. Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix would write in 1721 that the Miami had a settlement in what is now Chicago around 1670. Chicago&#x27;s location at a short canoe portage (the Chicago Portage) connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi River system attracted the attention of many French explorers, notably Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673. &quot;The Jesuit Relations&quot; indicate that by this time, the Iroquois tribes of New York had driven the Algonquian tribes entirely out of Lower Michigan and as far as this portage, during the later Beaver Wars.

René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who traversed the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers south of Chicago in the winter of 1681–82, identified the Des Plaines River as the western boundary of the Miami. In 1683, La Salle built Fort St. Louis on the Illinois River. Almost two thousand Miami, including Weas and Piankeshaws, left the Chicago area to gather at the Grand Village of the Illinois, seeking French protection from the Iroquois. In 1696, French Jesuits led by Jean-François Buisson de Saint-Cosme built the Mission of the Guardian Angel to Christianize the local Wea and Miami people. Shortly thereafter, Augustin le Gardeur de Courtemanche visited the settlement on behalf of the French government, seeking peace between the Miami and Iroquois. Miami chief Chichikatalo accompanied de Courtemanche to Montreal.

The Algonquian tribes began to retake the lost territory in the ensuing decades, and in 1701, the Iroquois formally abandoned their claim to their &quot;hunting grounds&quot; as far as the portage to England in the Nanfan Treaty, which was finally ratified in 1726. This was largely a political maneuver of little practicality, as the English then had no presence in the region whatsoever, the French and their Algonquian allies being the dominant force in the area. A writer in 1718 noted at the Was had a village in Chicago, but had recently fled due to concerns about approaching Ojibwes and Pottawatomis. The Iroquois and Meskwaki probably drove out all Miami from the Chicago area by the end of the 1720s. The Pottawatomi assumed control of the area, but probably did not have any major settlements in Chicago. French and allied use of the Chicago portage was mostly abandoned during the 1720s because of continual Native American raids during the Fox Wars.

There was also a Michigamea chief named Chicago who may have lived in the region. In the 1680s, the Illinois River was called the Chicago River.

===First non-native settlements===
The first settler in Chicago was Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a Frenchman of European and African descent, who built a farm at the mouth of the Chicago River in 1788 to 1790. He left Chicago in 1800. In 1968, Point du Sable was honored at Pioneer Court as the city&#x27;s founder and featured as a symbol.

In 1795, following the Northwest Indian War, some Native Americans ceded the area of Chicago to the United States for a military post in the Treaty of Greenville. The US built Fort Dearborn in 1803 on the Chicago River. It was destroyed by Indian forces during the War of 1812 in the Battle of Fort Dearborn, and many of the inhabitants were killed or taken prisoner. The fort had been ordered to evacuate. During the evacuation soldiers and civilians were overtaken near what is today Prairie Avenue. After the end of the war, the Potawatomi ceded the land to the United States in the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis. (Today, this treaty is commemorated in Indian Boundary Park.) Fort Dearborn was rebuilt in 1818 and used until 1837.

==Growth of the city==



In 1829, the Illinois legislature appointed commissioners to locate a canal and lay out the surrounding town. The commissioners employed James Thompson to survey and plat the town of Chicago, which at the time had a population of less than 100. Historians regard the August 4, 1830, filing of the plat as the official recognition of a location known as Chicago.

Yankee entrepreneurs saw the potential of Chicago as a transportation hub in the 1830s and engaged in land speculation to obtain the choicest lots. On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was incorporated with a population of 350. The Chippewa, Odawa and Potawatomi ceded land in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago and were forced to move west of the Mississippi River by 1838. On July 12, 1834, the &quot;Illinois&quot; from Sackets Harbor, New York, was the first commercial schooner to enter the harbor, a sign of the Great Lakes trade that would benefit both Chicago and New York state. Chicago was granted a city charter by the State of Illinois on March 4, 1837; it was part of the larger Cook County. By 1840 the boom town had a population of over 4,000.

After 1830, the rich farmlands of northern Illinois attracted Yankee settlers. Yankee real estate operators created a city overnight in the 1830s. To open the surrounding farmlands to trade, the Cook County commissioners built roads south and west. The latter crossed the &quot;dismal Nine-mile Swamp,&quot; the Des Plaines River, and went southwest to Walker&#x27;s Grove, now the Village of Plainfield. The roads enabled hundreds of wagons per day of farm produce to arrive and so the entrepreneurs built grain elevators and docks to load ships bound for points east through the Great Lakes. Produce was shipped through the Erie Canal and down the Hudson River to New York City; the growth of the Midwest farms expanded New York City as a port.

In 1837, Chicago held its first mayoral election and elected William B. Ogden as its inaugural mayor.

===Emergence as a transportation hub===

In 1848, the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal allowed shipping from the Great Lakes through Chicago to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The first rail line to Chicago, the Galena &amp; Chicago Union Railroad, was completed the same year. Chicago would go on to become the transportation hub of the United States, with its road, rail, water, and later air connections. Chicago also became home to national retailers offering catalog shopping such as Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and Company, which used the transportation lines to ship all over the nation.

By the 1850s, the construction of railroads made Chicago a major hub and over 30 lines entered the city. The main lines from the East ended in Chicago, and those oriented to the West began in Chicago and so by 1860, the city had become the nation&#x27;s trans-shipment and warehousing center. Factories were created, most famously the harvester factory that was opened in 1847 by Cyrus Hall McCormick. It was a processing center for natural resource commodities extracted in the West. The Wisconsin forests supported the millwork and lumber business; the Illinois hinterland provided the wheat. Hundreds of thousands of hogs and cattle were shipped to Chicago for slaughter, preserved in salt, and transported to eastern markets. By 1870, refrigerated cars allowed the shipping of fresh meat to cities in the East.

The prairie bog nature of the area provided a fertile ground for disease-carrying insects. In springtime, Chicago was so muddy from the high water that horses could scarcely move. Comical signs proclaiming &quot;Fastest route to China&quot; or &quot;No Bottom Here&quot; were placed to warn people of the mud.

Travelers reported Chicago was the filthiest city in America. The city created a massive sewer system. In the first phase, sewage pipes were laid across the city above ground and used gravity to move the waste. The city was built in a low-lying area subject to flooding. In 1856, the city council decided that the entire city should be elevated four to five feet by using a newly available jacking-up process. In one instance, the five-story Brigg&#x27;s Hotel, weighing 22,000 tons, was lifted while it continued to operate. Observing that such a thing could never have happened in Europe, the British historian Paul Johnson cites the astounding feat as a dramatic example of American determination and ingenuity based on the conviction that anything material is possible.

===Immigration and population in 19th century===

Although originally settled by Yankees in the 1830s, the city in the 1840s had many Irish Catholics come as a result of the Great Famine. Later in the century, the railroads, stockyards, and other heavy industry of the late 19th century attracted a variety of skilled workers from Europe, especially Germans, English, Swedes, Norwegians, and Dutch. A small African-American community formed, led by activist leaders like John Jones and Mary Richardson Jones, who established Chicago as a stop on the Underground Railroad.

In 1840, Chicago was the 92nd city in the United States by population. Its population grew so rapidly that 20 years later, it was the ninth city. In the pivotal year of 1848, Chicago saw the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, its first steam locomotives, the introduction of steam-powered grain elevators, the arrival of the telegraph, and the founding of the Chicago Board of Trade. By 1857, Chicago was the largest city in what was then called the Northwest. In 20 years, Chicago grew from 4,000 people to over 90,000. Chicago surpassed St. Louis and Cincinnati as the major city in the West and gained political notice as the home of Stephen Douglas, the 1860 presidential nominee of the Northern Democrats. The 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago nominated the home-state candidate Abraham Lincoln. The city&#x27;s government and voluntary societies gave generous support to soldiers during the American Civil War.

Many of the newcomers were Irish Catholic and German immigrants. Their neighborhood saloons, a center of male social life, were attacked in the mid-1850s by the local Know-Nothing Party, which drew its strength from evangelical Protestants. The new party was anti-immigration and anti-liquor and called for the purification of politics by reducing the power of the saloonkeepers. In 1855, the Know-Nothings elected Levi Boone mayor, who banned Sunday sales of liquor and beer. His aggressive law enforcement sparked the Lager Beer Riot of April 1855, which erupted outside a courthouse in which eight Germans were being tried for liquor ordinance violations. After 1865, saloons became community centers only for local ethnic men, as reformers saw them as places that incited riotous behavior and moral decay. Salons were also sources of musical entertainment. Francis O&#x27;Neill, an Irish immigrant who later became police chief, published compendiums of Irish music that were largely collected from other newcomers playing in saloons.

By 1870, Chicago had grown to become the nation&#x27;s second-largest city and one of the largest cities in the world. Between 1870 and 1900, Chicago grew from a city of 299,000 to nearly 1.7 million and was the fastest-growing city in world history. Chicago&#x27;s flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from Eastern and Central Europe, especially Jews, Poles, and Italians, along with many smaller groups. Many businesspeople and professionals arrived from the eastern states. Relatively few new arrivals came from Chicago&#x27;s rural hinterland. The exponential growth put increasing pollution on the environment, as hazards to public health impacted everyone.

===Gilded Age===

Most of the city burned in the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. The damage from the fire was immense since 300 people died, 18,000 buildings were destroyed, and nearly 100,000 of the city&#x27;s 300,000 residents were left homeless. Several key factors exacerbated the spread of the fire. Most of Chicago&#x27;s buildings and sidewalks were then constructed of wood. Also, the lack of attention to proper waste disposal practices, which was sometimes deliberate to favor certain industries, left an abundance of flammable pollutants in the Chicago River along which the fire spread from the south to the north. The fire led to the incorporation of stringent fire-safety codes, which included a strong preference for masonry construction.

The Danish immigrant Jens Jensen arrived in 1886 and soon became a successful and celebrated landscape designer. Jensen&#x27;s work was characterized by a democratic approach to landscaping, which was informed by his interest in social justice and conservation, and a rejection of antidemocratic formalism. Among Jensen&#x27;s creations were four Chicago city parks, most famously Columbus Park. His work also included garden design for some of the region&#x27;s most influential millionaires.

The World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 was constructed on former wetlands at the present location of Jackson Park along Lake Michigan in Chicago&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood. The land was reclaimed according to a design by the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The temporary pavilions, which followed a classical theme, were designed by a committee of the city&#x27;s architects under the direction of Daniel Burnham. It was called the &quot;White City&quot; for the appearance of its buildings.

The Exposition drew 27.5 million visitors; is considered among the most influential world&#x27;s fairs in history; and affected art, architecture, and design throughout the nation. The classical architectural style contributed to a revival of &quot;Beaux Arts&quot; architecture that borrowed from historical styles, but Chicago was also developing the original skyscraper and organic forms based in new technologies. The fair featured the first and until recently the largest Ferris wheel ever built.

The soft, swampy ground near the lake proved unstable ground for tall masonry buildings. That was an early constraint, but builders developed the innovative use of steel framing for support and invented the skyscraper in Chicago, which became a leader in modern architecture and set the model nationwide for achieving vertical city densities.

Developers and citizens began immediate reconstruction on the existing Jeffersonian grid. The building boom that followed saved the city&#x27;s status as the transportation and trade hub of the Midwest. Massive reconstruction using the newest materials and methods catapulted Chicago into its status as a city on par with New York and became the birthplace of modern architecture in the United States.

===Rise of industry and commerce===

Chicago became the center of the nation&#x27;s advertising industry after New York City. Albert Lasker, known as the &quot;father of modern advertising&quot;, made Chicago his base from 1898 to 1942. As head of the Lord and Thomas agency, Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women, who seldom smoked cigarettes, were told that if they smoked Lucky Strikes, they could stay slender. Lasker&#x27;s use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for Palmolive soap, Pepsodent toothpaste, Kotex products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.

===Gambling===
In Chicago, like other rapidly growing industrial centers with large immigrant working-class neighborhoods, gambling was a major issue. The city&#x27;s elite upper-class had private clubs and closely-supervised horse racing tracks. The middle-class reformers like Jane Addams focused on the workers, who discovered freedom and independence in gambling that were a world apart from their closely-supervised factory jobs and gambled to validate risk-taking aspect of masculinity, betting heavily on dice, card games, policy, and cock fights. By the 1850s, hundreds of saloons had offered gambling opportunities, including off-track betting on the horses. The historian Mark Holler argues that organized crime provided upward mobility to ambitious ethnics. The high-income, high-visibility vice lords, and racketeers built their careers and profits in ghetto neighborhoods and often branched into local politics to protect their domains. For example, in 1868 to 1888, Michael C. McDonald, &quot;The Gambler King of Clark Street,&quot; kept numerous Democratic machine politicians in his city on expense account to protect his gambling empire and to keep the goo-goo reformers at bay.

In large cities, illegal businesses like gambling and prostitution were typically contained in the geographically-segregated red light districts. The businessowners made regularly-scheduled payments to police and politicians, which they treated as licensing expenses. The informal rates became standardized. For example, in Chicago, they ranged from $20 a month for a cheap brothel to $1000 a month for luxurious operations in Chicago. Reform elements never accepted the segregated vice districts and wanted them all destroyed, but in large cities, the political machine was powerful enough to keep the reformers at bay. Finally, around 1900 to 1910, the reformers grew politically strong enough to shut down the system of vice segregation, and the survivors went underground.

==20th century==


Chicago&#x27;s manufacturing and retail sectors, fostered by the expansion of railroads throughout the upper Midwest and East, grew rapidly and came to dominate the Midwest and greatly influence the nation&#x27;s economy. The Chicago Union Stock Yards dominated the packing trade. Chicago became the world&#x27;s largest rail hub, and one of its busiest ports by shipping traffic on the Great Lakes. Commodity resources, such as lumber, iron and coal, were brought to Chicago and Ohio for processing, with products shipped both East and West to support new growth.

Lake Michigan—the primary source of fresh water for the city—became polluted from the rapidly growing industries in and around Chicago; a new way of procuring clean water was needed. In 1885 the civil engineer Lyman Edgar Cooley proposed the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. He envisioned a deep waterway that would dilute and divert the city&#x27;s sewage by funneling water from Lake Michigan into a canal, which would drain into the Mississippi River via the Illinois River. Beyond presenting a solution for Chicago&#x27;s sewage problem, Cooley&#x27;s proposal appealed to the economic need to link the Midwest with America&#x27;s central waterways to compete with East Coast shipping and railroad industries.

Strong regional support for the project led the Illinois legislature to circumvent the federal government and complete the canal with state funding. The opening in January 1900 met with controversy and a lawsuit against Chicago&#x27;s appropriation of water from Lake Michigan. By the 1920s the lawsuit was divided between the states of the Mississippi River Valley, who supported the development of deep waterways linking the Great Lakes with the Mississippi, and the Great Lakes states, which feared sinking water levels might harm shipping in the lakes. In 1929 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in support of Chicago&#x27;s use of the canal to promote commerce, but ordered the city to discontinue its use for sewage disposal.

New construction boomed in the 1920s, with notable landmarks such as the Merchandise Mart and art deco Chicago Board of Trade Building completed in 1930. The Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression and diversion of resources into World War II led to the suspension for years of new construction.

The Century of Progress International Exposition was the name of the World&#x27;s Fair held on the Near South Side lakefront from 1933 to 1934 to celebrate the city&#x27;s centennial. The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago&#x27;s founding. More than 40 million people visited the fair, which symbolized for many hope for Chicago and the nation, then in the midst of the Great Depression.

The demographics of the city were changing in the early 20th century as black southern families migrated out of the south, but while cities like Chicago empathized with the condition of impoverished white children, black children were mostly excluded from the private and religious institutions that provided homes for such children. Those that did take in black dependent children were overcrowded and underfunded because of institutional racism. Between 1899 and 1945 many of the city&#x27;s black children found themselves in the juvenile court system. The 1899 Juvenile Court Act, supported by Progressive reformers, created a class of dependants for orphans and other children lacking &quot;proper parental care or guardianship&quot; but the court&#x27;s designations of &quot;delinquency&quot; and &quot;dependency&quot; were racialized so black children were far more likely to be labeled as delinquents.

===Politics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries===

During the election of April 23, 1875, the voters of Chicago chose to operate under the Illinois Cities and Villages Act of 1872. Chicago still operates under this act, in lieu of a charter. The Cities and Villages Act has been revised several times since, and may be found in Chapter 65 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes.

Late-19th-century big city newspapers such as the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; - founded in 1875 by Melville Stone - ushered in an era of news reporting that was, unlike earlier periods, in tune with the particulars of community life in specific cities. Vigorous competition between older and newer-style city papers soon broke out, centered on civic activism and sensationalist reporting of urban political issues and the numerous problems associated with rapid urban growth. Competition was especially fierce between the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; (Democratic), the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (Republican), and the &quot;Daily News&quot; (independent), with the latter becoming the city&#x27;s most popular paper by the 1880s. The city&#x27;s boasting lobbyists and politicians earned Chicago the nickname &quot;Windy City&quot; in the New York press. The city adopted the nickname as its own.

====Violence and crime====
Polarized attitudes of labor and business in Chicago prompted a strike by workers&#x27; lobbying for an eight-hour work day, later named the Haymarket affair. A peaceful demonstration on May 4, 1886, at Haymarket near the west side was interrupted by a bomb thrown at police; seven police officers were killed. Widespread violence broke out. A group of anarchists were tried for inciting the riot and convicted. Several were hanged and others were pardoned. The episode was a watershed moment in the labor movement, and its history was commemorated in the annual May Day celebrations.

By 1900, Progressive Era political and legal reformers initiated far-ranging changes in the American criminal justice system, with Chicago taking the lead.

The city became notorious worldwide for its rate of murders in the early 20th century, yet the courts failed to convict the killers. More than three-fourths of cases were not closed. Even when the police made arrests in cases where killers&#x27; identities were known, jurors typically exonerated or acquitted them. A blend of gender-, race-, and class-based notions of justice trumped the rule of law, producing low homicide conviction rates during a period of soaring violence.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, rates of domestic murder tripled in Chicago. According to historian Jeffrey S. Adler, domestic homicide was often a manifestation of strains in gender relations induced by urban and industrial change. At the core of such family murders were male attempts to preserve masculine authority. Yet, there were nuances in the motives for the murder of family members, and study of the patterns of domestic homicide among different ethnic groups reveals basic cultural differences. German male immigrants tended to murder over declining status and the failure to achieve economic prosperity. Italian men killed family members to save a gender-based ideal of respectability that entailed patriarchal control over women and family reputation. African American men, like the Germans, often murdered in response to economic conditions but not over desperation about the future. Like the Italians, the killers tended to be young, but family honor was not usually at stake. Instead, black men murdered to regain control of wives and lovers who resisted their patriarchal &quot;rights&quot;.

Progressive reformers in the business community created the Chicago Crime Commission (CCC) in 1919 after an investigation into a robbery at a factory showed the city&#x27;s criminal justice system was deficient. The CCC initially served as a watchdog of the justice system. After its suggestion that the city&#x27;s justice system begin collecting criminal records was rejected, the CCC assumed a more active role in fighting crime. The commission&#x27;s role expanded further after Frank J. Loesch became president in 1928. Loesch recognized the need to eliminate the glamor that Chicago&#x27;s media typically attributed to criminals. Determined to expose the violence of the crime world, Loesch drafted a list of &quot;public enemies&quot;; among them was Al Capone, whom he made a scapegoat for widespread social problems.

After the passage of Prohibition, the 1920s brought international notoriety to Chicago. Bootleggers and smugglers bringing in liquor from Canada formed powerful gangs. They competed with each other for lucrative profits, and to evade the police, to bring liquor to speakeasies and private clients. The most notorious was Al Capone.

===Immigration and migration in the 20th century===
From 1890 to 1914, migrations swelled, attracting to the city of mostly unskilled Catholic and Jewish immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, including Italians, Greeks, Czechs, Poles, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Hungarians, and Slovaks. World War I cut off immigration from Europe, which brought hundreds of thousands of southern blacks and whites into Northern cities to fill in the labor shortages. The Immigration Act of 1924 restricted populations from southern and eastern Europe, apart from refugees after World War II. The heavy annual turnover of ethnic populations ended, and the groups stabilized, each favoring specific neighborhoods.

While whites from rural areas arrived and generally settled in the suburban parts of the city, large numbers of blacks from the South arrived as well. The near South Side of the city became the first Black residential area, as it had the oldest, less expensive housing. Although restricted by segregation and competing ethnic groups such as the Irish, gradually continued black migration caused this community to expand, as well as the black neighborhoods on the near West Side. These were &quot;de facto&quot; segregated areas (few blacks were tolerated in ethnic white neighborhoods); the Irish and ethnic groups who had been longer in the city began to move to outer areas and the suburbs. After World War II, the city built public housing for working-class families to upgrade residential quality. The high-rise design of such public housing proved a problem when industrial jobs left the city and poor families became concentrated in the facilities. After 1950, public housing high rises anchored poor black neighborhoods south and west of the Loop.

&quot;Old stock&quot; Americans who relocated to Chicago after 1900 preferred the outlying areas and suburbs, with their commutes eased by train lines, making Oak Park and Evanston enclaves of the upper middle class. In the 1910s, high-rise luxury apartments were constructed along the lakefront north of the Loop, continuing into the 21st century. They attracted wealthy residents but few families with children, as wealthier families moved to suburbs for the schools. There were problems in the public school system; mostly Catholic students attended schools in the large parochial system, which was of middling quality. There were a few private schools. The Latin School, Francis Parker and later The Bateman School, all centrally located served those who could afford to pay.
The northern and western suburbs developed some of the best public schools in the nation, which were strongly supported by their wealthier residents. The suburban trend accelerated after 1945, with the construction of highways and train lines that made commuting easier. Middle-class Chicagoans headed to the outlying areas of the city, and then into the Cook County and Dupage County suburbs. As ethnic Jews and Irish rose in economic class, they left the city and headed north. Well-educated migrants from around the country moved to the far suburbs.

Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Polonia&quot; sustained diverse political cultures in the early twentieth century, each with its own newspaper. In 1920 the community had a choice of five daily papers – from the Socialist &quot;Dziennik Ludowy&quot; (People&#x27;s Daily; 1907–1925) to the Polish Roman Catholic Union&#x27;s &quot;Dziennik Zjednoczenia&quot; (Union Daily; 1921–1939). The decision to subscribe to a particular paper reaffirmed a particular ideology or institutional network based on ethnicity and class, which lent itself to different alliances and different strategies.

In 1926, the city hosted the 28th International Eucharistic Congress, a major event for the Catholic community of Chicago.

As the First World War cut off immigration, tens of thousands of African Americans came north in the Great Migration out of the rural South. With new populations competing for limited housing and jobs, especially on the South Side, social tensions rose in the city. Postwar years were more difficult. Black veterans looked for more respect for having served their nation, and some whites resented it.

In 1919, the Chicago race riot erupted, in what became known as &quot;Red Summer&quot;, when other major cities also suffered mass racial violence based in competition for jobs and housing as the country&#x27;s employment infrastructure struggled to absorb veterans in the postwar years. During the riot, thirty-eight people died (23 black and 15 white) and over five hundred were injured. Much of the violence against blacks in Chicago was led by members of ethnic Irish athletic clubs, who had much political power in the city and defended their &quot;territory&quot; against African Americans. As was typical in these occurrences, more blacks than whites died in the violence.

From 1920 to 1921, the city was affected by a series of tenant rent strikes. Which lead to the formation of the Chicago Tenants Protective association, passage of the Kessenger tenant laws, and of a heat ordinance that legally required flats to be kept above during winter months by landlords.

Concentrating the family resources to achieve home ownership was a common strategy in the ethnic European neighborhoods. It meant sacrificing current consumption, and pulling children out of school as soon as they could earn a wage. By 1900, working-class ethnic immigrants owned homes at higher rates than native-born people. After borrowing from friends and building associations, immigrants kept boarders, grew market gardens, and opened home-based commercial laundries, eroding home-work distinctions, while sending out women and children to work to repay loans. They sought not middle-class upward mobility but the security of home ownership. Many social workers wanted them to pursue upward job mobility (which required more education), but realtors asserted that houses were better than a bank for a poor man. With hindsight, and considering uninsured banks&#x27; precariousness, this appears to have been true. Chicago&#x27;s workers made immense sacrifices for home ownership, contributing to Chicago&#x27;s sprawling suburban geography and to modern myths about the American dream. The Jewish community, by contrast, rented apartments and maximized education and upward mobility for the next generation.

Beginning in the 1940s, waves of Hispanic immigrants began to arrive. The largest numbers were from Mexico and Puerto Rico, as well as Cuba during Fidel Castro&#x27;s rise. During the 1980s, Hispanic immigrants were more likely to be from Central and South America.

After 1965 and the change in US immigration laws, numerous Asian immigrants came; the largest proportion were well-educated Indians and Chinese, who generally settled directly in the suburbs. By the 1970s gentrification began in the city, in some cases with people renovating housing in old inner city neighborhoods, and attracting singles and gay people.

===1930s===
===Labor unions===
After 1900 Chicago was a heavily unionized city, apart from the factories (which were non-union until the 1930s). The Industrial Workers of the World was founded in Chicago in June 1905 at a convention of 200 socialists, anarchists, and radical trade unionists from all over the United States. The Railroad brotherhoods were strong, as were the crafts unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The AFL unions operated through the Chicago Federation of Labor to minimize jurisdictional conflicts, which caused many strikes as two unions battled to control a work site.

The unionized teamsters in Chicago enjoyed an unusually strong bargaining position when they contended with employers around the city, or supported another union in a specific strike. Their wagons could easily be positioned to disrupt streetcars and block traffic. In addition, their families and neighborhood supporters often surrounded and attacked the wagons of nonunion teamsters who were strikebreaking. When the teamsters used their clout to engage in sympathy strikes, employers decided to coordinate their antiunion efforts, claiming that the teamsters held too much power over commerce in their control of the streets. The teamsters&#x27; strike in 1905 represented a clash both over labor issues and the public nature of the streets. To the employers, the streets were arteries for commerce, while to the teamsters, they remained public spaces integral to their neighborhoods.

===World War II===
On December 2, 1942, the world&#x27;s first controlled nuclear reaction was conducted at the University of Chicago as part of the top secret Manhattan Project.

During World War II, the steel mills in the city of Chicago alone accounted for 20% of all steel production in the United States and 10% of global production. The city produced more steel than the United Kingdom during the war, and surpassed Nazi Germany&#x27;s output in 1943 (after barely missing in 1942).

The city&#x27;s diversified industrial base made it second only to Detroit in the value—$24 billion—of war goods produced. Over 1,400 companies produced everything from field rations to parachutes to torpedoes, while new aircraft plants employed 100,000 in the construction of engines, aluminum sheeting, bombsights, and other components. The Great Migration, which had been on pause due to the Depression, resumed at an even faster pace as the 1910 - 1930 period, as hundreds of thousands of black Americans arrived in the city to work in the steel mills, railroads, and shipping yards.

===Postwar===
Returning World War II veterans and immigrants from Europe (in particular displaced persons from Eastern Europe) created a postwar economic boom and led to the development of huge housing tracts on Chicago&#x27;s Northwest and Southwest sides. The city was extensively photographed during the postwar years by street photographers such as Richard Nickel and Vivian Maier.

In the 1950s, the postwar desire for new and improved housing, aided by new highways and commuter train lines, caused many middle and higher income Americans to begin to move from the inner-city of Chicago to the suburbs. Changes in industry after 1950, with restructuring of the stockyards and steel industries, led to massive job losses in the city for working-class people. The city population shrank by nearly 700,000. The City Council devised &quot;Plan 21&quot; to improve neighborhoods and focused on creating &quot;Suburbs within the city&quot; near downtown and the lakefront. It built public housing to try to improve housing standards in the city. As a result, many poor were uprooted from newly created enclaves of Black, Latino, and poor people in neighborhoods such as Near North, Wicker Park, Lakeview, Uptown, Cabrini–Green, West Town and Lincoln Park. The passage of civil rights laws in the 1960s also affected Chicago and other northern cities. In the 1960s and the 1970s, many middle- and upper-class Americans continued to move from the city for better housing and schools in the suburbs.

Office building resumed in the 1960s. When completed in 1974, the Sears Tower, now known as the Willis Tower, was at 1451 feet the world&#x27;s tallest building. It was designed by the famous Chicago firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, which designed many of the city&#x27;s other famous buildings.

Mayor Richard J. Daley served 1955–1976, dominating the city&#x27;s machine politics by his control of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee, which selected party nominees, who were usually elected in the Democratic stronghold. Daley took credit for building four major expressways focused on the Loop, and city-owned O&#x27;Hare Airport (which became the world&#x27;s busiest airport, displacing Midway Airport&#x27;s prior claims). Several neighborhoods near downtown and the lakefront were gentrified and transformed into &quot;suburbs within the city&quot;. He held office during the unrest of the 1960s, some of which was provoked by the police department&#x27;s discriminatory practices. In the Lincoln Park, Lakeview, Wicker Park and Humboldt Park communities, the Young Lords under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez marched and held sit ins to protest the displacement of Latinos and the poor. After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, major riots of despair resulted in the burning down of sections of the black neighborhoods of the South and West sides. Protests against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago, resulted in street violence, with televised broadcasts of the Chicago police&#x27;s beating of unarmed protesters.

In 1979, Jane Byrne, the city&#x27;s first woman mayor, was elected, winning the Democratic primary due to a citywide outrage about the ineffective snow removal across the city. In 1983, Harold Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, became mayor in 1989, and was repeatedly reelected until he declined to seek re-election in 2011. He sparked debate by demolishing many of the city&#x27;s vast public housing projects, which had deteriorated and were holding too many poor and dysfunctional families. Concepts for new affordable and public housing have changed to include many new features to make them more viable: smaller scale, environmental designs for public safety, mixed-rate housing, etc. New projects during Daley&#x27;s administration have been designed to be environmentally sound, more accessible and better for their occupants.

==21st century==

In September 2008, Chicago accepted a $2.52 billion bid on a 99-year lease of Midway International Airport to a group of private investors, but the deal fell through due to the collapse of credit markets during the 2008–2012 global recession In 2008, as Chicago struggled to close a growing budget deficit, the city agreed to a 75-year, $1.16 billion deal to lease its parking meter system to an operating company created by Morgan Stanley. Daley said the &quot;agreement is very good news for the taxpayers of Chicago because it will provide more than $1 billion in net proceeds that can be used during this very difficult economy.&quot; The agreement quadrupled rates, in the first year alone, while the hours which people have to pay for parking were broadened from 9 a.m. – 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. – 9 p.m., and from Monday through Saturday to every day of the week. Additionally, the city agreed to compensate the new owners for loss of revenue any time any road with parking meters is closed by the city for anything from maintenance work to street festivals. In three years, the proceeds from the lease were all but spent. In his annual budget address on October 21, 2009, Daley projected a deficit for 2009 of more than $520 million. Daley proposed a 2010 budget totaling $6.14 billion, including spending $370 million from the $1.15 billion proceeds from the parking meter lease. In his annual budget address on October 13, 2010, Daley projected a deficit for 2010 of $655 million, the largest in city history. Daley proposed a 2011 budget totaling $6.15 billion, including spending all but $76 million of what remained of the parking meter lease proceeds, and received a standing ovation from aldermen.

In 2011, Rahm Emanuel was elected mayor of Chicago. Chicago earned the title of &quot;City of the Year&quot; in 2008 from &quot;GQ&quot; for contributions in architecture and literature, its world of politics, and the downtown&#x27;s starring role in the Batman movie &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. The city was rated by Moody&#x27;s as having the most balanced economy in the United States due to its high level of diversification.

==Flag==
Four historical events are commemorated by the four red stars on Chicago&#x27;s flag: The United States&#x27; Fort Dearborn, established at the mouth of the Chicago River in 1803; the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which destroyed much of the city; the World Columbian Exposition of 1893, by which Chicago celebrated its recovery from the fire; and the Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair of 1933–1934, which celebrated the city&#x27;s centennial. The flag&#x27;s two blue stripes symbolize the north and south branches of the Chicago River, which flows through the city&#x27;s downtown. The three white stripes represent the North, West and South sides of the city, Lake Michigan being the east side.

==Major disasters==
The most famous and serious disaster was the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.

On December 30, 1903, the &quot;absolutely fireproof&quot;, five-week-old Iroquois Theater was engulfed by fire. The fire lasted less than thirty minutes; 602 people died as a result of being burned, asphyxiated, or trampled.

The S.S. &quot;Eastland&quot; was a cruise ship based in Chicago and used for tours. On July 24, 1915—a calm, sunny day—the ship was taking on passengers when it rolled over while tied to a dock in the Chicago River. A total of 844 passengers and crew were killed. An investigation found that the &quot;Eastland&quot; had become too heavy with rescue gear that had been ordered by Congress in the wake of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster.

On December 1, 1958, the Our Lady of the Angels School Fire occurred in the Humboldt Park area. The fire killed 92 students and three nuns; in response, fire safety improvements were made to public and private schools across the United States.

April 13, 1992, billions of dollars in damage was caused by the Chicago Flood, when a hole was accidentally drilled into the long-abandoned (and mostly forgotten) Chicago Tunnel system, which was still connected to the basements of numerous buildings in the Loop. It flooded the central business district with 250 million US gallons (950,000 m3) of water from the Chicago River.

A major environmental disaster occurred in July 1995, when a week of record high heat and humidity caused 739 heat-related deaths, mostly among isolated elderly poor and others without air conditioning.

==List of mayors==



Between 1833 and 1837, Chicago was incorporated as a town and headed by town presidents. Since 1837, it has been incorporated as a city and headed by mayors.

The mayoral term in Chicago was one year from 1837 through 1863, when it was changed to two years. In 1907, it was changed again, this time to four years. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation moved them to April. In 1869, however, election day was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were changed. In 1875, election day was moved back to April by the city&#x27;s vote to operate under the Cities and Villages Act of 1872.

1 Since 1999, mayoral elections have officially been nonpartisan. A 1995 Illinois law stipulated that &quot;candidates for mayor ... no longer would run under party labels in Chicago&quot;. However, Richard M. Daley, Rahm Emanuel, Lori Lightfoot, and Brandon Johnson are known to be Democrats.

<text>Roslindale is a primarily residential neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, bordered by Jamaica Plain, Hyde Park, West Roxbury and Mattapan. 
It is served by an MBTA Commuter Rail line, several MBTA bus lines and the MBTA Orange Line in nearby Jamaica Plain. Roslindale has its own branch of the Boston Public Library, the neighborhood is covered by Boston Police District E-5 in West Roxbury, Boston EMS Ambulance 17 is stationed in Roslindale, and the Boston Fire Department has a station on Canterbury Street which houses Ladder 16, Engine 53 &amp; District Chief 12. Roslindale&#x27;s original Engine Company 45, was deactivated on April 10, 1981, due to budget cuts. Roslindale was once called the &quot;garden suburb&quot; of Boston. The portion of the Arnold Arboretum south of Bussey Street is located in Roslindale.

Six miles south-southwest of downtown Boston, Roslindale was originally part of the town of Roxbury. In 1851, current day Jamaica Plain, Roslindale and West Roxbury seceded from Roxbury. The area voted in 1873 to be annexed to the City of Boston.

==History==
In the 1860s, the area was called South Street Crossing, due to the railroad&#x27;s intersection with South Street. However, when the community applied for a post office district of its own, the name &quot;South Street Crossing&quot; proved to be unacceptable to the government. The name Roslindale was suggested by John Pierce, a well-traveled member of the community, who told the assembled citizens that the area reminded him of the historic town of Roslin, Scotland, outside Edinburgh. Pierce thought the area was like a dale because of the hills surrounding it. Thus the combination of &quot;Roslin&quot; and &quot;dale&quot; was submitted to the United States Postal Service and the name Roslindale was formally established.

Roslindale grew residentially as a classic streetcar suburb. The railway was built after the American Civil War, and spawned a new round of commercial development. Roslindale saw steady growth in its residential population, beginning in the 1880s, with the introduction of the horse-drawn street railway service between Forest Hills and Dedham.

The Forest Hills disaster, a train wreck, occurred in Roslindale on March 14, 1887. A Boston &amp; Providence Railroad train consisting of a locomotive and nine passenger cars inbound from Dedham to Boston with over 200 passengers, was passing over a bridge at Bussey Street, in the current Arnold Arboretum, when the bridge collapsed causing the rear five cars to pile up on top of each other, killing twenty-three and injuring over one hundred. This is considered one of the first major rail catastrophes in the country, and contributed to the widespread inspection of train bridges across the U.S.

In the 1920s, Roslindale Square assumed the configuration it has today, with tree-lined Adams Park at its center. Roslindale falls in a crease between several other Boston neighborhoods and the parts of Roslindale adjacent to these surrounding neighborhoods take on the characteristics of those neighborhoods. For example, the western part of Roslindale blends seamlessly with West Roxbury&#x27;s one and two family residences and tree lined streets; and Roslindale&#x27;s northern area consists of dense two and three family residences amidst light industrial buildings similar to the adjacent Stony Brook corridor in Jamaica Plain.

On March 1, 1929, more than 5,000 people turned out to see Ashland Street renamed Cummins Highway in honor of Fr. John Cummins, the first pastor of Sacred Heart Church. The road had been widened to between 60&#x27; and 80&#x27;, and ran from Washington Street in Roslindale to River Street in Mattapan at a cost of $750,000. At the dedication ceremony, Mayor Malcolm Nichols handed Cummins the quill used to sign the name change into effect and Cummins then blessed the road and all who traveled on it. It was the first road in Boston to be called a highway and one of only a few to be named for a person still living.

Prior to the rise of suburban shopping malls in the 1970s, the Roslindale business district, Roslindale Square, was a major shopping district for the city of Boston, with department stores, showrooms, food markets, and a movie theatre. After suffering years of vacant storefronts and increased vandalism during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Roslindale Square enjoys a renewed success today as a local shopping district, which includes the restored Roslindale Substation and the rising number of new apartment buildings. Additionally, since the 1980s, the Roslindale Village Main Street has enjoyed success in creating a community in Roslindale Square, running several events including the Roslindale Farmers&#x27; Market and the annual tree lighting in Adams Park.
==Demographics==
Roslindale is a diverse neighborhood—according to the 2020 census, the racial makeup of its inhabitants was 45.7% Non-Hispanic White, 20.6% Non-Hispanic Black or African-American, 25.1% Hispanic or Latino, 3.5% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 5.2% identified as other or multiple races.

<doc id="1103877" wikidata="Q229447" url="?curid=1103877" title="3D Monster Maze">
<text>3D Monster Maze is a 1981 survival horror game designed by Malcolm Evans and published by J. K. Greye Software for the ZX81. Rendered using low-resolution character block &quot;graphics&quot;, it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, and one of the first games incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror.

&quot;3D Monster Maze&quot; puts the player in a maze with one exit and a hostile monster, the &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. There, the player must traverse the maze, from the first-person perspective, and escape through the exit without being eaten.

New Generation Software went on to become a well-known software firm with the Sinclair platform and continued to pioneer the 3D gaming technology for ZX81 and the later model ZX Spectrum. The press immediately gave the game a title of a &quot;firm favourite&quot; of the ZX81 users. Decades later, it became popular with the retrogaming community, inspiring remakes and fuelling ZX81 emulation projects.

==Gameplay==
The game uses an 18-by-16 cell maze which is randomly generated. Initially the &quot;T. rex&quot; lies in wait. Once the player starts moving, the beast begins hunting. Thereafter, the &quot;T. rex&quot; may either calm down (if the player goes into a part of the maze that is far enough away), or become more active as the player comes closer. If the &quot;T. rex&quot; gets a direct view of its prey, the monster will run directly at the player.

The &quot;T. rex&quot; anxiety level, reported to the player as a statement in the status line, provides an indirect clue to the player&#x27;s relative distance from the monster. These statements are: &quot;REX LIES IN WAIT&quot;, followed by &quot;HE IS HUNTING FOR YOU&quot;, &quot;FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING&quot;, &quot;REX HAS SEEN YOU&quot;, and RUN HE IS BESIDE YOU&quot; or RUN HE IS BEHIND YOU&quot;. The player&#x27;s speed is greater than the monster&#x27;s, thus it is possible to escape by running (unless the player is trapped in a dead end). The player can manually map the maze on a piece of paper with each step, but this becomes increasingly difficult as the pace increases. The fast pace can also lead to hard keyboard presses, which, in turn, can shake the computer/16K memory expansion connection, and lead to a sudden reset with several minutes worth reload time.

Points are awarded for each step made by the player any time the dinosaur is on an active hunt. Since the player runs faster than the monster, it is possible to accumulate points by running around in circles with the monster just a few steps behind. Points are also given upon successfully getting away through an exit and into another maze.

When the game ends, the player is informed about being &quot;sentenced to roam the maze forever&quot;, and then can either &quot;appeal&quot; or continue playing again in the last maze. If the appeal is attempted, it is rejected with 50% probability, in which case the player is sent back to roam the previous maze again. An appeal which is accepted effectively results in the computer self-reset via BASIC&#x27;s codice_1 statement.

==Technology==

The graphical view, animated in real time at around 6 frames per second, is composed of 8×8 pixel black-and-white characters, so the view is roughly square, taking a 25×24 area on the 32×24 text screen. Sub-character resolution of the ZX81 pseudo-graphics character set makes the resolution doubled in each dimension (making the view consist of 50×48 &quot;larger pixels&quot;). Using the 6 pseudo-graphics with a dithering pattern also made it possible for the game author to incorporate a third colour (grey) in the black-and-white picture. Part of the screen is reserved for the score count, and a one-line status message is occasionally overlaid at the bottom of the graphical view. The player always runs along the corridor&#x27;s centreline, and looks in the current direction only, which simplifies the rendering task.
The game&#x27;s 3D engine and the random maze creation code is written in Z80 machine code, produced with an assembler. This is augmented by several dozen BASIC lines for less critical tasks, such as the initial greetings and the game legend animation inter-line delay. The machine code subroutines block is embedded into the BASIC line 0, beginning with a codice_2 (BASIC comment) statement, making the interpreter step over it. If, by accident, one tries to edit the line via the BASIC line editor, the changes will not be accepted since 0 is an invalid line number. Such code is typically created by first creating a line with a valid number, and then modifying the number field in the BASIC program area using direct memory manipulation, such as codice_3. No copy protection is embedded into the game; moreover, the magnetic tapes of the time being unreliable, one could reuse the save entry point in the BASIC code (that was used by the original developers to have the game auto-run upon being loaded by the user) in order to save another program copy to the tape (for archival and backup purposes).

The game is controlled by three of the keyboard cursor control keys (left, forward and right, respectively 5, 7 and 8 on the ZX81 keyboard). The game speed can also be controlled according to the original cassette inlay, the BASIC line 370 has a hardwired constant determining a busy waiting loop delay. The constant initially is set to 5; by varying it from 0 to 9 the game can be adjusted from faster to slower tempo. The 6 frame per second figure corresponds to the delay set to zero, while holding the &quot;forward&quot; key to run straight. A somewhat jerky motion is perceived at this slow framerate which gives a feeling of being jerked along with each step of a desperate heavy run.

==Development==

&quot;3D Monster Maze&quot; was the first game programmed by Malcolm Evans based on a design by J.K.Greye. He worked in the aerospace industry, first in aircraft design, and then as a microprocessor scientist at Sperry Gyroscope in Bristol, United Kingdom. He received a ZX81 from his wife for his thirty-seventh birthday in April 1981. Malcolm developed basic aspects of the game to test what the computer was capable of, and completed it after adding design features suggested by J.K.Greye, including adding the T.Rex and turning the Maze into a game. Friends persuaded Malcolm that the game was of high enough quality to sell and it was eventually released by J.K. Greye Software in late 1981.

When soon after that the Bristol branch of Sperry Gyroscope closed, Malcolm made a decision to concentrate fully on computer gaming. The firm New Generation Software he had founded kept producing 3D games for the Sinclair Research computers, and became synonymous with 3D gaming on this platform for some time. Some of his games were hailed by the gaming scene, but some titles occasionally drew criticism from reviewers for their fancy graphics but poor game plot. After releasing &quot;3D Defender&quot; and &quot;Breakout&quot; for the ZX81, Malcolm switched the development efforts from ZX81 to ZX Spectrum as the latter model was released onto the market. In addition to republishing &quot;3D Monster Maze&quot;, the new firm also released such game titles as &quot;Escape&quot;, &quot;3D Tunnel&quot;, &quot;Knot in 3D&quot;, &quot;Corridors of Genon&quot;, &quot;Trashman&quot; and &quot;Travel with Trashman&quot;, &quot;Light Magic&quot;, &quot;Jonah Barrington&#x27;s Squash&quot;, &quot;The Custard Kid&quot; and &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot;.

==Reception==
The game was sold domestically in the UK and overseas, and became a hit shortly after it was released:
Contemporary reviews described it as &quot;the best game I have seen for the Sinclair ZX81&quot; and &quot;Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! Straight away this gets into my personal top ten ZX Programs ... Undoubtedly one of the best ZX programs available.&quot;.

Even though it did not use the undocumented hi-res graphics feature of the ZX81, and rendered the scene with pseudo-graphics characters (available in the standard ZX81 character set), the game was considered to be a remarkable achievement, utilising the machine&#x27;s capabilities to its best:
Soon the Sinclair platform users began switching over to the newer ZX Spectrum, which had better graphics resolution and colour, bigger RAM and ROM, as well as sound capability and a sleeker look and feel. Some people still continued to use their ZX81, and even the Spectrum users gave credit to &quot;3D Monster Maze&quot; as the game that brought the 3D aspect into the home computer gaming:
The success of Monster Maze brought recognition to Malcolm Evans and his company, New Generation Software. As a result, they continued to release more games that further improved the 3D gaming experience. Even when later hit games by N.G.S., such as &quot;Trashman&quot;, were covered by the gaming media reviews, &quot;3D Monster Maze&quot; was remembered as the landmark impressive start:
&quot;Edge&quot; in 2006 stated that &quot;3D Monster Maze&quot; &quot;is the original survival horror game&quot;, writing &quot;Ask any player and they&#x27;ll tell you what 3D Monster Maze was chiefly about: fear, panic, terror and facing an implacable, relentless foe who&#x27;s going to get you in the end.&quot; &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; agreed, in 2014 stating that &quot;Survival horror may have been a phrase first coined by Resident Evil, but it could&#x27;ve easily applied to Malcolm Evans&#x27; massive hit.&quot; With ZX81 games played mostly in emulated environments by the retrogaming community, it still receives enthusiastic reviews, even while modern high-end gaming consoles and home computers provide much richer capabilities for one&#x27;s immersion into a first-person 3D game:

<text>Yang Xiu (175 – 219), courtesy name Dezu, was an official and adviser serving under the warlord Cao Cao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.

==Life==
Yang Xiu was a son of Yang Biao (楊彪) and a grandson of Yang Ci (楊賜); Yang Ci was a son of Yang Bing (楊秉), son of Yang Zhen (楊震) of the Yang clan of Hongnong. His mother, Lady Yuan (袁氏), was Yuan Shu&#x27;s sister.

Sometime during the 200s, Yang Xiu was nominated as &quot;xiaolian&quot; and became a Registrar (主簿) under Cao Cao, the Imperial Chancellor. He was said to have been skilled in both civil and military affairs and understood Cao Cao well. Because of this, Yang Xiu became an influential figure in the government.

Yang Xiu was a close friend of Cao Cao&#x27;s son, Cao Zhi, and became involved in the succession struggle between Cao Zhi and his brother Cao Pi. Yang Xiu&#x27;s close links with Cao Zhi caused him misfortune during Cao Zhi&#x27;s occasional misbehaviour such as the incident in Ye city, where Cao Zhi drunkenly rode through the gate reserved for only the emperor. But the final blow was when Yang Xiu was discovered to have leaked the council&#x27;s discussion agenda to Cao Zhi so that his friend could prepare beforehand and impress Cao Cao. Because of this and remembering his connection with Yuan Shu, Cao Cao had Yang Xiu executed.

However Cao Pi personally did not dislike Yang Xiu. Cao Pi&#x27;s favourite sword was a gift from Yang Xiu and Cao Pi regularly kept the sword by his side. Later, after becoming the emperor, Cao Pi remembered that Yang Xiu once said that the sword originally belong to Wang Mao (王髦). A nostalgic Cao Pi then searched for Wang Mao&#x27;s whereabouts and awarded Wang with food and clothes.

Yang Xiu&#x27;s death was commonly related to the story of &quot;chicken ribs&quot;, which was mentioned in Pei Songzhi&#x27;s annotation of the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, and was popularized by the novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. It was thought that the true reason for Xiu&#x27;s death was not really because of his relationship with Cao Zhi, but because he correctly guessed Cao Cao&#x27;s inner thoughts, which was taboo, and carelessly revealed these thoughts to other people, which was even more forbidden. People like Cao Cao always wanted to mystify themselves and have political secrets which could not be arbitrarily shared with anyone. Hence, subordinates like Yang Xiu were considered an imminent threat.

Prior to Yang Xiu&#x27;s death, Cao Cao had written a letter to his father Yang Biao, reproaching him for his son&#x27;s arrogance. After news of his execution, Yang Biao was struck by grief and self-blame, becoming gray-haired and thin. Upon hearing this, Cao Cao sent Yang Biao many gifts to compensate for the loss of his son.

==Anecdotes==


==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Cao Cao thinks that Yang Xiu is too boastful and overconfident in his cleverness, and eventually kills him after what is known as the &quot;chicken rib&quot; incident.

At the time, Cao Cao&#x27;s army was fighting against Liu Bei during the famous Hanzhong campaign. The battle had been going unfavorably for Cao Cao and he planned to retreat, but did not openly admit this. One evening, when a messenger asked him for that night&#x27;s verbal passcode, Cao Cao saw some chicken ribs in his soup and thoughtlessly answered &quot;chicken rib.&quot; Yang Xiu interpreted Cao Cao&#x27;s message as a metaphor for &quot;retreat&quot; and instructed all generals to have their soldiers pack their bags and break camp. Yang Xiu&#x27;s logic was thus: chicken ribs are inedible, but not completely worthless, similar to the difficult situation that Cao Cao was facing. When Cao Cao was alerted of Yang Xiu&#x27;s action, he was enraged and executed Yang Xiu.

Later on, as the battle turned even more against him, Cao Cao finally ordered a retreat. Remembering Xiu&#x27;s prediction, Cao Cao had his subordinate&#x27;s body collected and gave him a proper funeral.

In an earlier chapter, Yang Xiu was described by Mi Heng as one of the two sole &quot;talented&quot; officials under Cao Cao (the other being Kong Rong). However, this should be taken with a grain of salt, as Mi Heng&#x27;s other opinions, actions, and ultimate fate suggest he is a poor judge of character.

<doc id="1103880" wikidata="Q468121" url="?curid=1103880" title="Rose Madder (novel)">
<text>Rose Madder is a horror/fantasy novel by American writer Stephen King, published in 1995. It deals with the effects of domestic violence (which King had touched upon before in the novels &quot;It&quot;, &quot;Insomnia&quot;, &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;, &quot;Needful Things&quot;, and many others) and, unusually for a King novel, relies for its fantastic element on Greek mythology. In his memoir, &quot;On Writing&quot;, King states that &quot;Rose Madder&quot; and &quot;Insomnia&quot; are &quot;stiff, trying-too-hard novels.&quot;

==Plot==
In 1985, police officer Norman Daniels brutally beats his wife Rosie while she is four months pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage. Rosie considers leaving Norman, but dismisses the idea because Norman is a cop who specializes in finding missing persons and she has nowhere else to go as her family died in a car accident years earlier. The short-tempered Norman has recently been accused of raping a Black woman named Wendy Yarrow, and the subsequent lawsuit and internal affairs investigation has made him even more volatile. 

Nine years later, Rosie notices a drop of blood on the couple&#x27;s bedsheet and realizes that, if she stays with Norman, he will eventually kill her. Taking his credit card, Rosie departs on a bus to an unfamiliar city in the Midwest, with no clear plan of action. Once there, she meets a good-natured man named Peter Slowik, who guides her to a local women&#x27;s shelter. She quickly makes new friends, including the owner of the shelter, Anna Stevenson, who helps Rosie find a small apartment and a job as a hotel maid. A few weeks later, Rosie decides to pawn her engagement ring but finds that the ring&#x27;s &quot;diamond&quot; is fake. In the pawnshop, her attention is drawn to a painting which depicts a woman in a rose madder gown. Fascinated, she trades her ring for the painting.

On the street, Rosie is stopped by a man named Rob Lefferts, a customer at the pawnshop, who asks her to read an excerpt from a book. Rob likes her voice and offers her a job recording audiobooks. Sometime later, Bill Steiner, the pawnshop owner, asks Rosie out on a date. Rosie believes that her life is improving, and gradually notices that the painting is changing and expanding. Eventually she is able to travel through it. On the other side, she is met by Dorcas, who resembles Wendy Yarrow. She also sees the woman in the painting, whom she calls &quot;Rose Madder&quot; because of her dress and her apparent insanity. Rose Madder asks Rosie to rescue her baby from an underground labyrinth guarded by the blind, one-eyed bull Erinyes, who orients by smell. Dorcas leads Rosie to the temple grounds and warns her of the dangers that await. Dorcas cannot enter the labyrinth due to a mysterious illness that she and her mistress are afflicted with. Rosie ventures into the temple alone, and she ponders the reality of her situation. Rosie manages to save the child, whom she names Caroline, and Rose Madder promises “to repay”. Waking up the next morning, Rosie decides that everything that had happened was a dream.

Meanwhile, Norman conducts a search for Rosie, having resolved to kill her. He tracks down the city she is residing in and gradually loses his self-control; he begins killing people who have some connection to Rosie, including Peter and Anna. When Norman catches Rosie returning from a date with Bill, she flees from him into her apartment and lures him into the painting, where Rose Madder kills him. Rose gives Rosie some seeds and makes her promise to &quot;remember the tree&quot;. Rosie exits Rose&#x27;s world and burns the painting. Several years later, Rosie is married to Bill, with whom she has a daughter. However, she experiences outbursts of rage characteristic of Rose Madder. Rosie recalls her promise and plants a seed near a lake, and the tree that grows from it helps restrain Rosie&#x27;s rage.

==Adaptations==
In 1996, HBO Pictures acquired the rights to the novel to make a television movie. This would have been the first HBO film based on a Stephen King novel, but the project never came to fruition. A film adaptation of &quot;Rose Madder&quot; was in development in 2011, but the project fell apart. There was an audiobook made narrated by Blair Brown and King himself.

==Connections to other King works==
*The character of Cynthia Smith appeared in &quot;Desperation&quot; and &quot;The Regulators&quot;.
*In the prologue, Rose is reading &quot;Misery&#x27;s Journey&quot;, an entry in the fictional series of books written by the main character in King&#x27;s novel, &quot;Misery&quot;.
*The city of Lud from &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; appears in this novel.

<doc id="1103889" wikidata="Q2973361" url="?curid=1103889" title="Division of Adelaide">
<text>The Division of Adelaide is an Australian electoral division in South Australia and is named for the city of Adelaide, South Australia&#x27;s capital.

At the 2016 federal election, the electorate covered 76 km², is centred on the Adelaide city centre and spanning from Grand Junction Road in the north to Cross Road in the south and from Portrush Road in the east to Marion and Holbrooks Road in the west, taking in suburbs including Ashford, Enfield, Goodwood, Kent Town, Keswick, Kilburn, Mansfield Park, Maylands, Northgate, Norwood, Parkside, Prospect, Rose Park, St Peters, Toorak Gardens, Torrensville, Thebarton, Unley and Walkerville.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==
The division of Adelaide was one of seven single-member seats established when the seven-member statewide Division of South Australia was abolished following the inaugural 1901 election. For the first 40 years after Federation, it was one of the few Federation seats in the state that regularly changed hands between the Australian Labor Party and the conservative parties. Despite the bellwether-like swinging tendency, unusually the only time Adelaide was won by an incoming government was in 1931.

However, Labor held it for all but six years from 1943 to 1993, including a 23-year Labor hold during the Robert Menzies era. For most of the time from 1943 to 1987, it was a fairly safe Labor seat. Labor&#x27;s hold on the seat loosened slightly in the late 1980s due to pro-Liberal demographic change, and it was briefly lost to the Liberals at a 1988 by-election, but regained in 1990.

As with the modern state electoral district of Adelaide, for most of its first century, the federal Division of Adelaide covered only the Adelaide city centre and a few nearby inner north suburbs up to Regency Road in Prospect.

===Later years===
A pre-1993 boundary redistribution pushed the seat to the south, adding Liberal-leaning suburbs to the south of the Adelaide city centre for the first time, while removing Labor suburbs in the north-east. That resulted in Liberal Trish Worth holding the seat for eleven years, albeit on slender margins.

Kate Ellis regained Adelaide for Labor in 2004 on a 1.3 percent margin from a two percent two-party swing. Ellis increased her margin to 8.5 percent in 2007, before falling to 7.7 percent in 2010 and to 4.0 percent in 2013, before increasing to 4.7 percent in 2016.

In 2016, the major party vote was suppressed in all eleven state seats in the presence of Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) candidates in all eleven South Australian seats. Though Labor picked up a two-party swing in all eleven, the NXT presence produced a result where Kingston ended up as the only South Australian seat to record an increase, however small, to the primary vote of a particular major party. Additionally, Adelaide was the only seat of the state&#x27;s eleven where the Greens vote increased, while also producing both the highest Green vote and the lowest NXT vote in the state. This is in contrast to 2007 where the Xenophon Senate ticket polled higher in Adelaide than in most other seats.

===2018 redistribution and next election===
Labor incumbent Kate Ellis announced in March 2017 that she would step down from the Labor shadow cabinet in the following months and would not re-contest her seat at the end of the parliamentary term. The 2018 South Australian federal redistribution saw the seat of Adelaide lose all of its inner-eastern suburbs and a couple of its southern suburbs, while gaining a long strip of western suburbs spanning the entire north-south length of the seat. These changes saw the Labor margin increase significantly from 4.7 percent to a notional 9.0 percent. In July 2018, Steve Georganas, the Labor member for neighbouring Hindmarsh, sought and won preselection for Adelaide at the 2019 election, yielding his former seat to fellow Labor MP Mark Butler, the member for abolished Port Adelaide.

<text>Paratico (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It is located at the southwestern end of Lake Iseo.

==Territory==

The town of Paratico is part of the hilly area called Franciacorta.

==History==

Paratico lies at Franciacorta&#x27;s extreme western border, in a splendid position overlooking Lake Iseo. The place name had already made its appearance in the year 975, when the Longobard Erberto donated to his nephew Rotepaldo some of his properties, among which, Paratico.
Its past strategic importance is attested by the impressive ruins of the powerful castello Lantieri, located on a hill top and commanding a view all over the surrounding landscape. The castle was probably built in the 13th century, perhaps on the foundations of an older castle, dating back to 1007. It rises on a solitary place, ideal to control the outlet of the Oglio river from Lake Iseo, and to survey the roads leading to the plain and to Bergamo. The Lantieri family, in the 15th century, had already spread into several branches; they sided with the Ghibellines, and owned many properties, both in Paratico and Torbiato, including some stone quarries. According to the &quot;Chronicle of the Lantieri de Paratico family&quot;, written in 1600, Dante Alighieri stayed at the castle in 1311. Here, the poet would have drawn his inspiration to conceive Purgatory&#x27;s structure and to compose some of his lyrics.
In Vanzago, on the old road to Capriolo, there was a 13th-century castle, subsequently transformed into a convent and then, in 1850, into a hospital. Today it has become a farm. In the locality of S. Pietro rises the church of that name, dating back to 1730; on 8 December, every year, it is the scene of a traditional festival dedicated to the &quot;Madonna of the Apples&quot; (the legend says that the man used to offer an apple to his lady, in token of his love). The parish church dates back to the 15th century. Previous to the construction of S. Peter&#x27;s cemetery, corpses were buried around this church; it was enlarged and renovated in 1724 and furtherly improved in 1878. Some interesting works are preserved in its interior, such as the polychrome inlaid high altar and the splendid Rosary kaltar, with marble marquetry. 
Fusia&#x27;s water mill and irrigation ditch represent a complex medieval achievement of hydraulic engineering; they favoured the development of commercial and market activities in Paratico. The surrounding hills offer some enchanting vistas. The sandstone called &quot;Sarnico&#x27;s stone&quot; is still quarried from these hills; it was much used for construction in past centuries. The splendid position between the lake and the hills, and its good hotel facilities, make Paratico one of the favourite tourist spots of the whole territory.

<doc id="1103898" wikidata="Q420272" url="?curid=1103898" title="DD-Transpeptidase">
<text>-Transpeptidase (, &quot;-peptidase&quot;, &quot;-transpeptidase&quot;, &quot;-carboxypeptidase&quot;, &quot;-alanyl--alanine carboxypeptidase&quot;, &quot;-alanyl--alanine-cleaving-peptidase&quot;, &quot;-alanine carboxypeptidase&quot;, &quot;-alanyl carboxypeptidase&quot;, and &quot;serine-type -Ala--Ala carboxypeptidase&quot;.) is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the R--αα--alanyl moiety of R--αα--alanyl--alanine carbonyl donors to the γ-OH of their active-site serine and from this to a final acceptor. It is involved in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, namely, the transpeptidation that crosslinks the peptide side chains of peptidoglycan strands.

The antibiotic penicillin irreversibly binds to and inhibits the activity of the transpeptidase enzyme by forming a highly stable penicilloyl-enzyme intermediate. Because of the interaction between penicillin and transpeptidase, this enzyme is also known as penicillin-binding protein (PBP).

== Mechanism ==
-Transpeptidase is mechanistically similar to the proteolytic reactions of the trypsin protein family.

Crosslinking of peptidyl moieties of adjacent glycan strands is a two-step reaction. The first step involves the cleavage of the -alanyl--alanine bond of a peptide unit precursor acting as carbonyl donor, the release of the carboxyl-terminal -alanine, and the formation of the acyl-enzyme. The second step involves the breakdown of the acyl-enzyme intermediate and the formation of a new peptide bond between the carbonyl of the -alanyl moiety and the amino group of another peptide unit.

Most discussion of -peptidase mechanisms revolves around the catalysts of proton transfer. During formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, a proton must be removed from the active site serine hydroxyl group and one must be added to the amine leaving group. A similar proton movement must be facilitated in deacylation. The identity of the general acid and base catalysts involved in these proton transfers has not yet been elucidated. However, the catalytic triad tyrosine, lysine, and serine, as well as serine, lysine, serine have been proposed.

== Structure ==
Transpeptidases are members of the penicilloyl-serine transferase superfamily, which has a signature SxxK conserved motif. With &quot;x&quot; denoting a variable amino acid residue, the transpeptidases of this superfamily show a trend in the form of three motifs: SxxK, SxN (or analogue), and KTG (or analogue). These motifs occur at equivalent places, and are roughly equally spaced, along the polypeptide chain. The folded protein brings these motifs close to each other at the catalytic center between an all-α domain and an α/β domain.

The structure of the streptomyces K15 -transpeptidase has been studied, and consists of a single polypeptide chain organized into two domains. One domain contains mainly α-helices, and the second one is of α/β-type. The center of the catalytic cleft is occupied by the Ser35-Thr36-Thr37-Lys38 tetrad, which includes the nucleophilic Ser35 residue at the amino-terminal end of helix α2. One side of the cavity is defined by the Ser96-Gly97-Cys98 loop connecting helices α4 and α5. The Lys213-Thr214-Gly215 triad lies on strand β3 on the opposite side of the cavity. The backbone NH group of the essential Ser35 residue and that of Ser216 downstream from the motif Lys213-Thr214-Gly215 occupy positions that are compatible with the oxyanion hole function required for catalysis.

The enzyme is classified as a -transpeptidase because the susceptible peptide bond of the carbonyl donor extends between two carbon atoms with the -configuration.

== Biological Function ==
All bacteria possess at least one, most often several, monofunctional serine -peptidases.

== Disease Relevance ==

This enzyme is an excellent drug target because it is essential, is accessible from the periplasm, and has no equivalent in mammalian cells. -Transpeptidase is the target protein of β-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillin). This is because the structure of the β-lactam closely resembles the -ala--ala residue.

β-Lactams exert their effect by competitively inactivating the serine -transpeptidase catalytic site. Penicillin is a cyclic analogue of the -Ala--Ala terminated carbonyl donors, therefore in the presence of this antibiotic, the reaction stops at the level of the serine ester-linked penicilloyl enzyme. Thus β-lactam antibiotics force these enzymes to behave like penicillin binding proteins.

Kinetically, the interaction between the -peptidase and β-lactams is a three-step reaction:

formula_1

β-Lactams may form an adduct E-I* of high stability with . The half life of this adduct is around hours, whereas the half-life of the normal reaction is in the order of milliseconds.

The interference with the enzyme processes responsible for cell wall formation results in cellular lysis and death due to the triggering of the autolytic system in the bacteria.

<text>Peaks &amp; Valleys is the third solo album by Scottish–Australian singer Colin Hay, released in 1992. Hay recorded each song in one take, over a seven day period, in a Melbourne recording studio, owned by former Men at Work band member, Greg Ham.

Hay discussing the album in an interview with &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; in 1992, commented &quot;I want it to be a monumental smash, I doubt it will be, but that&#x27;s what I would like. I&#x27;m prepared to be disappointed but I&#x27;m also prepared to be very excited. I don&#x27;t have any control over what happens to it now, it&#x27;s in the lap of the gods.&quot; He went onto to say &quot;I play the guitar and I sing a song and entertain, that&#x27;s my job and if people like listening to it - that&#x27;s great, that makes me feel fulfilled.&quot;

The album was re-released in 1996 by BMG, in 1998 by Lazyeye Records and in 2006 by Compasss Records.

==Reviews==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine on Allmusic stated that &quot;Even though it doesn&#x27;t contain any truly outstanding songs, Peaks &amp; Valleys is a pleasant and engaging collection of jangly, vaguely reggae-ish pop from Colin Hay, demonstrating that his melodic skills have not left him.&quot;

<text>Jo Jo Gunne was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, United States, in 1971 by Jay Ferguson and Mark Andes after they had left the rock band Spirit. The band was named after the Chuck Berry song &quot;Jo Jo Gunne&quot;. The band released their eponymous debut album in 1972 and had a top 10 hit song, &quot;Run Run Run&quot;, in the UK. They released three further albums before disbanding in 1974. They reunited in 2005 for a time to record a fifth album, &quot;Big Chain&quot;.

==Career==
Jo Jo Gunne was formed by Jay Ferguson (keyboards, vocals and guitar) and brothers Mark (bass and vocals) and Matt Andes (born February 6, 1949; guitar, vocals), along with William &quot;Curly&quot; Smith (born January 31, 1952, Wolf Point, Montana; drums, vocals, and harp) in 1971. Ferguson chose the group&#x27;s name, &quot;Jo Jo Gunne&quot;, from a 1958 Chuck Berry song about a monkey of that name that caused a fight between a lion and an elephant. They performed their first major show in Los Angeles in May 1971 before they were signed to Asylum Records.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Jo Jo Gunne&quot;, was released in 1972 and the album reached number 57 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 Albums. 
The band had a number 6 hit in the UK Singles Chart in April 1972 with a song, &quot;Run Run Run&quot;, taken from the album. It also received airplay on U.S. album-oriented rock FM radio stations. The song reached number 30 in Canada.

Their second album, &quot;Bite Down Hard&quot;, was a minor success, peaking on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 chart at number 75. Due to the lack of a breakout single, this album sold more poorly than their 1971 introductory effort. The album was produced by Bill Szymczyk, who was best known at the time for his production work on Joe Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Barnstorm&quot; and B.B. King&#x27;s &quot;Completely Well&quot;.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Jumpin&#x27; the Gunne&quot;, featuring an obese naked woman on the cover, failed to rise any higher than number 169 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 chart. The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;So...Where&#x27;s the Show?&quot;, featured new guitarist John Staehely (a former member of Spirit), whose harder-edged sound complemented Ferguson&#x27;s songs, giving the band a much harder rock sound than on their previous efforts.
The group did not maintain the commercial momentum of their first release. They broke up in 1974.

==Personnel changes==
Following the first album, Mark Andes left the band after a falling out with his brother Matt and Ferguson, and was replaced by Jimmie Randall. Randall introduced a brighter bass sound and helped increase the band&#x27;s overall volume.

Matt Andes left after &quot;Jumpin&#x27; the Gunne&quot;, and was briefly replaced by Starr Donaldson (born September 23, 1950) in 1974. A replacement was soon found in John Staehely (born 25 January 1952, Austin, Texas), who had played on &quot;Feedback&quot;, the Spirit album that followed Ferguson and Andes&#x27;s departure. Staehely&#x27;s overdriven guitar was a significant change from Matt Andes&#x27;s Ry Cooder–style slide guitar.

After the band broke up, Ferguson recorded several solo albums, which yielded the hit singles &quot;Thunder Island&quot; and &quot;Shakedown Cruise&quot;. He then scored TV shows and several movies. Mark Andes joined Firefall and then Heart. Smith went on to have a career as a session drummer, and played with Spirit in the 1980s, and Boston from 1994 to 2000.

==Reunion==

The original line-up temporarily got back together around 1992. In a July 1995 interview in &quot;Vintage Guitar Magazine&quot;, Mark Andes recalls: &quot;Curly Smith called me up and noted that it was the twentieth anniversary of when that band had formed; Steve Lukather took us into the studio and we recorded a lot of new material, but it didn&#x27;t go anywhere&quot;.

They began recording again in 2005 in Santa Barbara at Jay Ferguson&#x27;s studio. The 2005 recordings were eventually put out as an album, &quot;Big Chain&quot;, on Blue Hand Records. The music was co-produced by the band and engineered by Ferguson.

<doc id="1103913" wikidata="Q4770484" url="?curid=1103913" title="Ans Westra">
<text>Anna Jacoba Westra (28 April 1936 – 26 February 2023), known as Ans Westra, was a Dutch-born New Zealand photographer, well known for her depictions of Māori life in the 20th century. Her prominence as an artist was amplified by her controversial 1964 children&#x27;s book &quot;Washday at the Pa&quot;.

== Early life ==
Westra was born in 1936 in Leiden, Netherlands, the only child of Pieter Hein Westra and Hendrika Christina van Doorn.

In 1953, Westra moved to Rotterdam and began study at the Industrieschool voor Meisjes. She graduated in 1957 with a diploma in arts and craft teaching, specialising in artistic needlework, and the same year, she left the Netherlands for New Zealand. She became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1963.

== Career ==

===Initial interest in photography and move to New Zealand===
Westra first encountered photography as a teenager through her stepfather. In 1956 she was inspired by a visit to the international exhibition &quot;The Family of Man&quot; in Amsterdam, together with the 1955 book by Johan van der Keuken, &quot;Wij Zijn 17 (We Are Seventeen)&quot; which depicted the lives of post-war Dutch teenagers. She began saving money so that she could purchase a high-end Rolleiflex camera, which she used for many years after.

In 1957, age 21, Westra travelled to New Zealand to visit her father who had already moved to the country. She stayed in Auckland and worked for eight months at Crown Lynn Potteries; she later returned to take photographs of the factory in 1963.

=== Wellington and professional photography ===
In 1958, Westra moved to Wellington, where she joined the Wellington Camera Club and worked in various local photographic studios. In 1960, Westra received international recognition winning a prize from the UK Photography magazine for her work entitled &quot;Assignment No. 2&quot;. That same year Westra had her first photograph published in New Zealand on the cover of &quot;Te Ao Hou / The New World&quot;, a magazine published by the Department of Maori Affairs. In 1962 she began working as a full-time, freelance documentary photographer. Much of her early work was for the School Publications Branch of the Department of Education and &quot;Te Ao Hou&quot;. On 21 June 1978 she documented the final day of the intervention art Vacant Lot of Cabbages and in 1979 she photographed the Ben Burn Park Concerts that were part of Summer City (Wellington).

=== &quot;Washday at the Pa&quot; and broader recognition ===
Westra lived with rural Māori for five months, photographing typical daily life, and in 1964 her school bulletin &quot;Washday at the Pa&quot; was published by the school publications section of the Department of Education and distributed to primary school classrooms throughout New Zealand. The book documents a large Māori family at their rural home in Ruatoria. The family was given the fictitious name &quot;Wereta&quot;, and listed as living &quot;near Taihape&quot; to protect their identities.

The living conditions of the family were seen as poor and their rural cottage rundown. Concerns were raised, including by the Māori Women&#x27;s Welfare League, that the depiction of the Weretas would lead readers—impressionable children—to see the family as representative of all Māori. The league requested its withdrawal from schools, and soon after its release the journal was withdrawn by order of the Minister of Education at the request of the league.

Later in 1964 &quot;Washday at the Pa&quot; was republished privately by the Caxton Press, with 20 additional photographs. An article written by academics in Auckland in 2016 about this event states: &quot;In a way the book, and the feelings it inspired, appealed strongly to Pākehā ideas of Māori, more so than it reflected some important truth about Māori themselves.&quot;

In 1967 &quot;Maori&quot; was published with photography by Westra and text by James Ritchie.

In 1972 &quot;Notes on the Country I Live In&quot; was published as the result of a project Westra undertook with support from the QEII Arts Council to photograph the people of New Zealand. The book includes text by James K. Baxter and Tim Shadbolt. 1972 was also the year of Westra&#x27;s first solo exhibition, which was held at the Dowse Art Gallery.

In 1982 an archive of Westra&#x27;s negatives was established at the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Westra undertook several artist-in-residences including at the Dowse Art Museum, Lower Hutt (1988–89), the Tylee Cottage Residency, Wanganui (1993) and in 1996, she was awarded the inaugural Southland Art Foundation Artist in Residence award by Southland Art Foundation, Southern Institute of Technology, Southland Museum and Art Gallery and Creative New Zealand. In 1998 Westra was artist-in-residence at the Otago School of Fine Arts, Otago Polytechnic.

In 2006 Westra was the subject of a 71 minute documentary directed by Luit Bieringa. &quot;Ans Westra: Private Journeys / Public Signposts&quot; played at the NZ International Film Festival and was nominated for a Qantas Media Award. Bieringa who like Westra emigrated to New Zealand from the Netherlands was commissioned by TVNZ to produce a 46 minute version of the documentary for TV One’s &quot;Artsville&quot; series.

Westra&#x27;s 2009 book and exhibition, &quot;The Crescent Moon: The Asian Face of Islam in New Zealand&quot; features her own photographs, with text by New Zealand writer Adrienne Jansen. The book&#x27;s interviews and photographs of 37 individuals give insights into the lives of Asian Muslims in New Zealand.

&quot;Washday at the Pa&quot; was reissued in 2011 by Suite Publishing to include other photos of the same family taken in 1998.

In May 2013, Suite Publishing released Westra&#x27;s publication: &quot;Our Future: Ngā Tau ki Muri&quot;, which includes 137 often damning photographs of the New Zealand landscape, with text contributions from Hone Tuwhare, Russel Norman, Brian Turner, David Eggleton and David Lange.

Between February 2013 and April 2014, Westra undertook her &quot;Full Circle Tour&quot; to revisit centres where she had been particularly active during her career. She visited Ruatoria, Ruatoki, Rotorua, the Whanganui River, Kaitaia, Invercargill and Stewart Island.

In 2014, the digitization of Westra&#x27;s archive of negatives held at the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, came into effect through her representative, Suite Tirohanga.

Around 10,000 of Westra&#x27;s work prints are held in the collection of Te Papa.

Westra&#x27;s print &quot;Untitled, from Washday at the Pa, 1963&quot;, set a new auction record price at NZ$10,575 at Webb&#x27;s in Auckland, New Zealand, on 11 June 2015.

=== Westra Museum ===
On 20 April 2016, a museum in Wellington was established, dedicated to Westra&#x27;s work. This was in association with the dealer gallery Suite. In 2024 Suite Gallery set up a repository of Westra&#x27;s belongings with the intention to hold exhibitions and community events.

=== Criticism ===
Westra faced criticism for her ownership of her images of Māori, that she built her career on images of Māori and that the subjects and their relations are not able to use the photographs without asking Westra for permission. The content being through a Pākehā gaze is also criticised including the controversy of &quot;Washday at the Pa.&quot; Another criticism was that Westra did not always stop to record the names of the people whose photographs she took. An attempt to rectify this, in 2024, involved the Suite Gallery in Wellington and Westra&#x27;s family. Photos taken by Westra, appearing on bill boards and on social media in Wellington, encouraged people to get in touch if they knew the identities of the sitters. 

== Personal life and death ==
In 1965 Westra returned to the Netherlands to live until 1969. She had three children.

Westra was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and later in life developed dementia. She died at her home in Wellington on 26 February 2023, at the age of 86.

== Honours and awards ==
Westra received a Certificate of Excellence from the New York World’s Fair photographic exhibition in 1964–1965. Westra was the Pacific regional winner of the Commonwealth Photography Award in 1986, travelling to the Philippines to photograph and then onwards to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and America. In the 1998 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Westra was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to photography, and in 2007 she became an Arts Foundation of New Zealand Icon artist. In 2015, Westra received an honorary doctorate from Massey University in recognition of her long-standing contribution to New Zealand’s visual culture.

<doc id="1103924" wikidata="Q844799" url="?curid=1103924" title="Gulf of Paria">
<text>The Gulf of Paria ( ; ) is a shallow (180 m at its deepest) semi-enclosed inland sea located between the island of Trinidad and the east coast of Venezuela. It separates the two countries by as little as 15 km at its narrowest and 120 km at its widest points. The tides within the Gulf are semi-diurnal in nature with a range of approximately 1m. The Gulf of Paria is considered to be one of the best natural harbors on the Atlantic coast of the Americas. The jurisdiction of the Gulf of Paria is split between Trinidad and Venezuela with Trinidad having control over approximately (37.7%) and Venezuela the remainder (62.3%).

It was originally named the Gulf of the Whale () by Christopher Columbus, but the 19th-century whaling industry eliminated whales from the area and populations have never recovered. Cartographic sources of the late 18th century repeatedly refer to it as the Sad Gulf ().
In the north, the Gulf is connected to the Caribbean Sea through the Dragons&#x27; Mouths () between the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela and the Chaguaramas Peninsula of Trinidad. In the south, the Gulf is connected to the Atlantic through the Columbus Channel, also known as the Serpent&#x27;s Mouth (), between the Cedros Peninsula and the Orinoco Delta.

==Oil and natural gas==
The Gulf of Paria lies entirely within the broad strike-slip plate boundary zone of the southeastern Caribbean. The structure of the Gulf consists of a complex set of transtensional basins superimposed on a fold-and-thrust belt (Serrania del Interior of eastern Venezuela). The petroleum of Trinidad has been generated by prolific Upper Cretaceous source rocks, time equivalent to the La Luna and Querecual formations in Colombia and Venezuela. These source rocks were then overlain by a thick succession of Paleogene deep-water sediments (shales and deep water sandstones) and shallow marine siliciclastic reservoir rocks. The transpression due to the influence of the Caribbean plate created several sub-basins across the Trinidad area; each having distinctive petroleum systems. The hydrocarbon basins in Trinidad are Southern Basin, Columbus Basin, Carupano Basin, Central Range/Darrien Ridge Basin and the Caroni Basin and Gulf of Paria Pull-apart Basin.

The Caroni Basin is a Cenozoic basin bounded to the north by the El Pilar fault zone and the Northern Range fold-thrust belt and to the south by the Central Range fold-thrust belt. Its stratigraphy features a shallowing section from the Miocene which overlies Palaeocene and Lower Cretaceous deep-water sediments. The Gulf of Paria is the western offshore extension of the Caroni basin. However, its deformation is now extensional due to the right-stepping of the dextral El Pilar fault to the dextral Warm Springs fault. The Los Bajos fault separates the Gulf of Paria from the Southern basin sediments. Natural gas has been discovered in the onshore Caroni basin while in the Gulf of Paria, both oil and gas have been discovered.

In 2021 an oil spill was discovered in the gulf. Between 2018 and April 2021 there have been 498 reported oil spills on land and at sea. There have been no resulting prosecutions or fines by Trinidad and Tobago authorities.

==Fisheries==
The Gulf of Paria is a brackish water body – wet season salinities are below 23 ppt (parts per thousand) with extensive mangroves along the Venezuelan and Trinidadian coastlines. This body of water is basically a shallow sedimentary basin with a maximum depth of 30 m (16 fathoms) and a smooth substratum of fine mud with patches of shell debris and sand (Kenny and Bacon, 1981). These conditions lend themselves to favourable fisheries conditions and the Gulf itself is an important fishery (Heileman and Ramsaroop, 1990). The proximity of the Orinoco Delta to the Gulf suggests that these waters are strongly influenced by fluvial discharges from the Amazon and Orinoco River systems, with the intensity of these discharges varying with the seasons (van Andel and Postma, 1954; Gade, 1961). These rivers are thought to be important effectors of nutrient enhancing upwelling currents on the adjacent continental shelf and sources of primary and secondary productivity for the water around Trinidad, especially in the Gulf (Farbes, 1983). As such, Trinidad supports a more productive and diverse exploitable fish and invertebrate resource base than most of the Eastern Caribbean islands (Agard et al. 1996). The Gulf of Paria is the most important fishing ground for shrimp and finfish in Trinidad.

In recent years, Venezuelan pirates have threatened fishermen operating in the region.

==Port and logistics==
Major ports located within the Gulf of Paria basin include:
* The Port of Port of Spain
* Plipdeco&#x27;s Port of Point Lisas in Couva
* Port of San Fernando
* Port of Point Fortin
* Pedernales in Venezuela&#x27;s Delta Amacuro state
*Oldendorff Carriers floating facility - Oldendorff Carriers have been operating a floating facility consisting of two cranes, within Trinidadian waters since 2012, for the purpose of transshipment of iron ore from Santana, Brazil to the Middle and the Far East.

<text>John Francis Shelley (September 3, 1905 – September 1, 1974) was a U.S. politician. He served as the 35th mayor of San Francisco, from 1964 to 1968, the first Democrat elected to the office in 50 years, and the first in an unbroken line of Democratic mayors that lasts to the present (). His tenure in the United States House of Representatives, immediately prior to his mayoralty (1949-1964), also broke a long streak of Republican House members (44 years) and began a streak of Democratic representatives from San Francisco (and, coincidentally, the ) that continues to the present ().

Shelley earned a law degree from the University of San Francisco in 1932. He served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II and was a member of the California State Senate from 1939 to 1947. He ran an unsuccessful race for the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s office against Goodwin Knight in 1946. Shelley would then make his mark as a leader of the California delegation to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, when he helped marshal his state&#x27;s votes to support a strong civil rights plank. Shelley entered the United States House of Representatives in 1949 and served until 1964, when he stepped down to be inaugurated Mayor of San Francisco after winning the November, 1963 election by nearly a 12-point margin against his nearest opponent, Harold Dobbs (50-38.5%).

==Early life, family and education==
John Francis Shelley was born in San Francisco on September 3, 1905, the oldest of nine children of Dennis Shelley and Mary Casey Shelley. His father was an immigrant from County Cork, Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom), who became a longshoreman in California. He grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco, then &quot;a tough working-class district,&quot; where he &quot;acquired a deep-seated belief that &#x27;working it out instead of fighting it out&#x27; was the best policy when disagreement was encountered.&quot; He attended Mission High School, where in 1923 he was elected student body president. He studied law at the University of San Francisco, while working as a bakery driver and playing varsity football.

==Early union activities==

After graduation (receiving his law degree in 1932), Shelley became a business agent for the Bakery Wagon Drivers Union. In 1936 he became an AFL official, defeating an incumbent to become vice-president of the San Francisco Labor Council. He was the council&#x27;s representative to the Pacific coast&#x27;s first industrial development conference aimed at girls and hosted by several Northern California YWCAs.

Shelley was elected president of the council in 1937. Shortly into his term, the council began organizing state agricultural and cannery workers under the AFL. Shelley was one of the leaders of the California People&#x27;s Legislative Conference, a group supporting Washington state&#x27;s minimum wage, while the Supreme Court was entertaining a constitutional challenge against it in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish.

Beginning in the spring of 1937, Shelley faced two crises. First, there was growing labor unrest. Second, the Committee for Industrial Organization actively attempted to replace the AFL as bargaining agent for local unionized shops. Strikes and threats of strikes in Northern California followed first the sit-down strike against General Motors and then strikes at several Works Progress Administration projects in the San Francisco Bay area. Shelley was active in settling several labor disputes, but despite his efforts 3,500 members of six unions went on strike against 16 leading San Francisco Hotels on May 1, 1937. On the same day, the AFL purged the CIO from the Alameda Labor Council owing to a jurisdictional dispute between the AFL Longshoremen and the CIO Teamsters, a move that the San Francisco Labor Council strongly disapproved. In the midst of the hotel strike, 2100 elevators and janitors in buildings citywide voted to strike, but the work-stoppage was postponed by the international to continue negotiating. Other unions voted to strike, including the milk wagon drivers.

==Relations with the FBI==
Prior to his election as a U.S. congressman, Shelley was included in the FBI&#x27;s Custodial Detention (DETCOM) files. The FBI&#x27;s &quot;DETCOM Program&quot; &quot;was concerned with the individuals &#x27;to be given priority arrest in the event of ... an emergency.&#x27;&quot; Priority under the Detcom program was given to &quot;all top functionaries, all key figures, all individuals tabbed under the Comsab program&quot;, and &quot;any other individual who, though he does not fall in the above groups, should be given priority arrest because of some peculiar circumstances&quot;.

A memo by Warren Olney III alerted FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to the fact that Shelley was recently elected and remained targeted, along with fellow San Francisco congressman Franck R. Havenner, to be arrested by the FBI as a security risk in case of a Soviet attack. A July 23, 1962 FBI search slip on Shelley is check-marked for &quot;subversive references only&quot; and remains heavily redacted with numerous unreleased documents.

==Mayor of San Francisco==
Shelley&#x27;s term as mayor was filled with challenges, including strikes over discriminatory hiring practices against African-Americans at the Palace Hotel, a public nurse strike in 1966, and a threatened San Francisco Symphony Orchestra strike in 1967. Shelley was mayor during the Summer of Love, a time of radicalism in the Haight-Ashbury and turmoil throughout the city, including Black rage toward the &quot;auto row&quot; on Van Ness Avenue. He was faced with riots in Bayview-Hunters Point on September 27, 1966, after a white police officer fatally shot a black youth accused of auto theft. Shelley declared a state of emergency in the city for six days. After the riots ended, Shelley took several public steps to improve relations between city government and the African-American community. He appointed the city and county&#x27;s first African-American supervisor, Terry Francois.

Shelley took an aggressive stance against several prominent anti-development mobilizations during his tenure, including movements in opposition to development at the Yerba Buena Gardens and in the Western Addition. Shelley bowed out of running for a second term in office; his stated reasons were health-related, but it was thought that prominent political forces in the city&#x27;s establishment wanted a more stringently pro-development mayor in office.

==Family==
Shelley&#x27;s son, Kevin Shelley, was a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 1990 to 1996, a member of the California State Assembly from 1997 to 2003 and served as California Secretary of State from 2003 to 2005. Shelley&#x27;s daughter, Joan-Marie Shelley, was a French teacher for 30 years at Lincoln High School and Lowell High School in San Francisco Unified School District and carried on the family tradition of labor union leadership, serving as vice-president (1978-1984) and president (1984-1989) of the San Francisco Federation of Teachers and as the founding president (1989-1997) of the United Educators of San Francisco, a merger of the local American Federation of Teachers and local National Education Association unions.

<text>Bernd Begemann (born 1 November 1962 in Braunschweig as &quot;Kay Stephan Rönnau&quot;) is a contemporary German alt/pop singer-songwriter, actor, producer and filmmusic-composer linked to the Hamburger Schule.

==Biography==

Begemann&#x27;s biological parents were Aykut Ünyazıcı, a footballer from Turkey at Eintracht Braunschweig and a woman from Germany. In 1963, he was adopted by Bernhard Begemann at the age of six months, who gave him his new name. He was very successful as sportsman as a teen and young adult and won a lot of competitions, because he was extremely talented as very fast runner but in the end of the 1970s, in his hometown of Bad Salzuflen (Germany) he became a punk and he founded in 1979 a punk rock band with the &quot;real rebel name&quot;, &quot;Vatikan&quot;. The members of this band were Bernd Begemann, Frank Jacobs (later in the band &quot;Out of Order&quot; and &quot;Time Twisters&quot;) and Martin Stammeier (later, the drummer of many Metal-bands).

From the middle to the end of the 1980s he was part of the Pop-music label &quot;Fast Weltweit&quot; (almost worldwide). It was founded by Michael Girke, Achim Knorr, Andreas Henning, Frank Spilker (Die Sterne) and Frank Werner. They released singles and cassette tape samplers, such as Jochen Distelmeyer&#x27;s (later in the band Blumfeld) &quot;Bienenjäger&quot; with Thomas Wenzel (now in Die Goldenen Zitronen and Die Sterne) and the very first Die Sterne single. Even with his connection to &quot;Fast Weltweit&quot;, Bernd never released any records with them.

When he was 20, Begemann moved to Hamburg to later create the band known as &quot;Die Antwort&quot; (engl.: The Answer). With Die Antwort, Begemann would finally be able to do the music he&#x27;s always desired. This made the &quot;Hamburg-Ostwestfalen-Verbindung&quot; (the Hamburg-East-Westphalian Connection).

1988 was the year that it finally happened: Die Antwort released its first CD. Produced for 150,000 german marks (by RCA), the (untitled) CD flopped because, according to some people, the band&#x27;s &quot;image was too hard for their soft sound&quot;. Eventually, Die Antwort broke up as a band.

With respect to his musical attitude, Begemann said: &quot;I only make music because nobody can speak for me. I&#x27;m the only one who can. That&#x27;s why being punk doesn&#x27;t just mean drinking cheap beer and puking on the sidewalk.&quot;

<doc id="1103959" wikidata="Q1653903" url="?curid=1103959" title="Sonya Blade">
<text>Sonya Blade is a character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. She debuted in the original 1992 game as the roster&#x27;s sole female fighter, a military officer with the Special Forces. In the storyline of the games, Sonya becomes involved with the eponymous Mortal Kombat tournament through the pursuit of her archenemy, the criminal leader Kano. She subsequently joins the warriors defending Earthrealm and establishes a government agency dedicated to battling otherworldly threats. The series&#x27; rebooted timeline also depicts her as the love interest to martial arts actor Johnny Cage and the mother of their daughter Cassie.

A mainstay of the franchise, Sonya has also appeared in various media outside of the games. Reception of the character has been generally positive, regarding her role as one of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″s primary female fighters. However, some of her outfits in the games have received criticism.

==Conception and creation==
The original 1992 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game initially featured six playable characters. According to series co-creator and programmer Ed Boon, a seventh was added by developers Midway Games after the president of Williams granted them an additional six weeks to &quot;polish the game&quot; following successful testing. The new character was named &quot;Stryker&quot; until the developers decided they needed a female character, which resulted in Sonya being added and given Stryker&#x27;s storyline of a Special Forces agent pursuing Kano. Sonya was named after one of Boon&#x27;s sisters, and was inspired by martial artist and actress Cynthia Rothrock. Rothrock later claimed that, following Midway&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to hire her to play Sonya in the original game, the company added her likeness and moves to the game without her consent. In a 1995 interview, series co-creator John Tobias compared Sonya to &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Chun-Li in including her in the game, opining that regardless of character gender, &quot;if you make them cool, people will play them.&quot;
According to Tobias, Sonya and Kano were chosen the least by players of the first game and were thus omitted from the 1993 sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, but were added as unplayable background characters as Tobias still wanted them in the game. Two female ninja characters, Kitana and Mileena, were added in her stead. Sonya and Kano returned as playable characters for &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995). Tobias explained that Midway&#x27;s objective was to make the game&#x27;s characters equal in terms of playability, and believed that male players &quot;aren&#x27;t so macho that they&#x27;re afraid to pick Sonya, because they know they can stay in the game with her and they can&#x27;t with somebody else.&quot; The action-adventure spin-off game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Special Forces&quot; (2000) was to have Sonya as a selectable character along with Jax, but she was dropped due to deadline issues exacerbated by Tobias&#x27;s sudden departure from Midway in 1999 due to his dissatisfaction with the game&#x27;s production.

NetherRealm Studios (formerly Midway Games) art director Steve Beran said of Sonya in the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot game, &quot;When you look at the version of Sonya or Scorpion from the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, it&#x27;s almost laughable how simple their costumes were. You have to give fans the recognizability of their favorite characters, but make it not look like Sonya&#x27;s wearing a leotard and workout clothes&quot;. Tobias said in 2012 that he created &quot;characters like Liu Kang or Shang Tsung, who represented the more mystical sides of the story&quot; of the original series, &quot;and Johnny Cage, Sonya or Jax, who came from places grounded more in reality...[Sonya and Kitana] were both important pieces of the game&#x27;s fiction and archetypal structure of characters. But, player demographic was primarily a hardcore male audience and so the look and design of our female characters pandered to them back then just as they do today.&quot;

===Live-action and voice portrayals===
Sonya was played by fitness instructor Elizabeth Malecki in the first game, but she and several other actors from the digitized &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games later filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against Midway over unpaid royalties from the home versions of the game and the unauthorized use of their likenesses. She was consequently replaced by Kerri Hoskins for &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;. Hoskins, whose martial arts training consisted of &quot;some Tang Soo Do and a past of WWF wrestling and gymnastics&quot;, had previously appeared in the Midway releases &quot;NBA Jam&quot; and &quot;Revolution X&quot;. She additionally played Sonya in the 1995-96 theatrical show &quot;Mortal Kombat: Live Tour&quot;, for which she underwent additional martial arts and gymnastics training. She explained in a 2010 interview that the show worked to emphasize getting young audiences into the martial arts, while she and the show&#x27;s other actors would give motivational speeches to schoolchildren. 

Motion capture for the character was provided by Hoskins in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;, and by Midway graphics artist Carlos Pesina for the three-dimensional games &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;. She was played by actress Lorrisa Julianus in &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;, the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot, and &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;. Kara Davidson played the character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;.

Sonya was voiced by Peg Burr from the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; to &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;. She was voiced by Beth Melewski for the beat-&#x27;em-up spinoff game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot;, by Dana Lyn Baron in &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; and the 2011 series reboot, and by Tricia Helfer in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, Sonya was voiced by mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey, and Bridgette Wilson, who played Sonya in the 1995 motion picture &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, provided her voice for a downloadable character skin inspired by the film.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
Sonya Blade is one of the main heroes of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series. In the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992), she is the lieutenant of a Special Forces unit that is pursuing Kano, the leader of the Black Dragon crime syndicate. She trails him to a remote island where Shang Tsung&#x27;s Mortal Kombat tournament is being held, but is captured and forced to compete. Sonya is not playable in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), but is included in the storyline when her superior, Major Jax Briggs, searches for her in the otherworldly dimension of Outworld, where the next tournament is held. Sonya is one of thunder god and Earth protector Raiden&#x27;s champions chosen to defend Earth against evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995). In &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1997), Sonya, along with Jax, again must aid Raiden and perennial Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang in defending Earth, this time from the fallen former Elder God Shinnok, while warning the United States government of the impending Outworld invasion.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), the Outerworld Investigation Agency, a government organization led by Sonya and Jax that investigates portals leading to other realms, has been destroyed, and she must rescue two agents stranded in Outworld. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), she and the other Earth heroes are killed by the Dragon King Onaga and resurrected to serve as his slaves until their souls are freed by the spirit of Liu Kang and Shao Kahn&#x27;s former enforcer Ermac. Sonya is playable along with the entire series roster in the compilation game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006). She is one of the characters representing Mortal Kombat in the non-canonical crossover game &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; (2008). 

Raiden&#x27;s attempt to prevent the titular Armageddon resets the timeline in the series reboot game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011). Sonya and Jax are pursuing Kano until Jax is imprisoned by tournament host Shang Tsung, who forces her to compete in order to spare his life until Raiden intervenes on her behalf. She also unwillingly acquaints herself with Johnny Cage after rejecting his advances. After Jax&#x27;s arms are obliterated by Ermac during the events of the second tournament in Outworld, Sonya transports him back to Earth for medical attention. She and Jax later regroup with the other heroes as they assemble to fight Shao Kahn&#x27;s invasion of Earth until they are massacred by Kahn&#x27;s brainwashed wife, Queen Sindel, leaving Sonya and Cage the lone survivors at the conclusion following Kahn&#x27;s death and Raiden&#x27;s accidental killing of Liu Kang.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), set several years after the previous game, Sonya and Johnny marry and have a daughter, Cassie Cage, but they later divorce due to Sonya&#x27;s focus on her career. Cassie grows up to join her mother&#x27;s Special Forces unit, and is the catalyst in defeating Shinnok and saving Earth, after which she, Sonya, and Johnny reconcile. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), Sonya, Cassie, and Jax&#x27;s daughter Jacqui lead a strike team into the underworld Netherrealm before its denizens can attack Earth, during which Sonya sacrifices herself to ensure the mission&#x27;s success and her allies&#x27; escape. When the keeper of time Kronika causes temporal anomalies amidst her plot to reset time, younger versions of Sonya and Johnny are brought to the present. Sonya is outraged that she has a child with Johnny and that Cassie apparently abandons her during the mission. After erasing Kano&#x27;s present self from existence, she begins to warm up to her version of Johnny and reconciles with Cassie. Sonya is not selectable in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), but appears as a assist-based &quot;Kameo&quot; fighter.

===Other appearances===
Sonya is one of the three main protagonists alongside Johnny Cage and Liu Kang in the feature film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995). Her backstory from the original game of pursuing her archenemy Kano to Shang Tsung&#x27;s island and being forced to compete in the tournament is intact, and she fights and kills Kano in the competition. Bridgette Wilson was cast as Sonya after the filmmakers&#x27; original choice, Cameron Diaz, injured her wrist during martial arts training and dropped out. Wilson performed her own stuntwork and was given the nickname &quot;RoboBabe&quot; by director Paul Anderson. As she was a late addition to the production, her fight scene with Kano was the final one shot in order to give her adequate time to train. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins&quot;, an animated prequel released four months prior to the film, Sonya (voiced by Jennifer Hale) is again one of the three main protagonists, to whom Raiden explains the history of the Mortal Kombat tournament. Wilson was replaced by Sandra Hess for the 1997 sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;. Sonya is devastated by the death of Johnny Cage, who is killed by evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn at the film&#x27;s start after he saves her life. She rescues her partner Jax and they join her fellow Earth heroes in stopping Kahn&#x27;s destruction of Earth. Hoskins had auditioned for the role but did not &quot;make the last cut of three girls&quot; due to having no acting experience.

Australian actress Jessica McNamee played Sonya in the 2021 reboot film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. She is depicted as a veteran who has spent years researching the Mortal Kombat tournament while having captured the mercenary Kano (Josh Lawson). McNamee, who submitted multiple audition tapes in campaigning for the role, described the character as &quot;the voice of reason&quot; with a degree of &quot;playfulness and lightness&quot;. McNamee reprised the role for the 2025 sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat 2&quot;.

Sonya is a main character in the animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot; (1996) and was voiced by Olivia d&#x27;Abo. She is a supporting character in the animated &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends&quot; films &quot;Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (2020) and &quot;Battle of the Realms&quot; (2021), voiced by Jennifer Carpenter.

Jeri Ryan played Sonya in the short film &quot;Mortal Kombat: Rebirth&quot; (2010). In the film&#x27;s grittier contemporary setting, she is a lieutenant in the fictional Deacon City Police Department. In the first two episodes of the follow-up web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; (2011), Sonya works with Jax to bust the Black Dragon but her obsession with hunting down Kano leads to her capture, forcing Jax to launch a rescue mission that ends with Kano escaping and Jax seriously injured.

Sonya appeared alongside the other characters from the first two &quot;Mortal Kombat &quot; games in Malibu Comics&#x27; licensed 1994-95 comic series. Her family dynamic with Johnny Cage and their daughter Cassie Cage is featured in DC Comics″ 2015 &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; comic series set before the events of the game. She appears in the novelizations of the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film and &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;. In Jeff Rovin&#x27;s non-canon novel &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), set prior to the tournament of the original game, Sonya works undercover as a Black Dragon operative in her attempt to apprehend Kano. 

Malecki appeared in costume as Sonya in a 1992 feature on the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; on the British television program &quot;GamesMaster&quot;. Hoskins dressed up as the character to film a workout video for Threshold Entertainment&#x27;s 1995 CD-ROM &quot;The Ultimate Guide to Mortal Kombat&quot;, and to promote &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Ronda Rousey, who voiced Sonya in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, wore a themed ring outfit for a match against Ruby Riot at the 2019 WWE Elimination Chamber as a promotion for the game. The character has been licensed for action figures, and limited-edition statuettes by Syco Collectibles.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to Sonya Blade has been positive, with commentators noting the character&#x27;s sex appeal and toughness. In 2016, Game Revolution included her among ten best female characters in video games, stating she had &quot;stood the test of time.&quot; &quot;Hyper&quot; also reported a minor &quot;controversy over the character Sonya Blade in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. Some men complained they didn&#x27;t want to kill her, and not just because they were fond of her big breasts and long legs - they just didn&#x27;t feel they could hit a girl.&quot; MSN included her among the 20 &quot;hottest women in video game history&quot;, stating, &quot;independent, tough, and willing to put herself on the line for her friends, Sonya Blade is the embodiment of the modern woman. Well, except for the part where she can sometimes rip your head off.&quot;

In 2014, GamesRadar called her &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;&#x27;s leading lady&quot;. Jason Gallagher of Game Rant opined that &quot;with all due respect to Kitana, Jade, and Mileena, [Sonya] is still the most recognizable female character in franchise history today. She&#x27;s played a large role in various ongoing storylines, and is one-half of the reason Cassie Cage exists today. The Special Forces crew has expanded greatly over the last two decades, but it was Sonya that started it all.&quot;

Sonya&#x27;s fight with Kano in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film was rated as the 19th best cinematic fight scene by UGO in 2010. Ranking this scene as the best in this film, UGO also commented that &quot;Sonya Blade has always been sort of an also-ran character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise, taking second place to the busty ninja sisters Kitana and Mileena. But the movies gave her a chance to shine.&quot; In 2011, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Wilson&#x27;s role as Sonya at 12th place on the list of &quot;hottest women in video game movies&quot;, but with likeness factor of only 29% (as compared to Sonya&#x27;s later appearance in the video game &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;). On the other hand, 1UP.com&#x27;s Retronauts opined Wilson was miscast and not convincing in the role, and Leonard Pitts cited Sonya being captured and taken hostage in the first film as a prime example in his 1995 article alleging that &quot;sexism still prevails in action movies.&quot;

Ash Kapriyelov, author of the document &quot;Representation of Women in Video Games&quot;, listed Sonya as an example of a &quot;positive shift in representation of women,&quot; progressing from &quot;Mortal Kombat 9&quot; to &quot;Mortal Kombat X,&quot; noting her &quot;MKX&quot; outfit as &quot;very conservative and realistic,&quot; in contrast to her &quot;MK9&quot; attire, which was more revealing. Author Maria Carolina Fontanella examined Sonya&#x27;s designs throughout the series. Regarding her &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; costume, Fontanella states &quot;Adding a short coat is not very effective when the character in question wears a white blouse, very short and tight to the body, that highlights your breasts and even has the straps of your panties showing above of the pants.&quot; For her aforementioned &quot;MK9&quot; costume, Fontanella examines &quot;Your panties are no longer showing, but your pants are low, almost showing her pelvis. The short blouse was exchanged for a kind of vest, which does nothing to protect her and is also extremely low-cut.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar&quot; author Lucas Sullivan commented &quot;Sonya is just as important to the plot of MK9 as her primarily male counterparts, playing the role of a Special Forces agent caught up in a tournament that will determine the fate of Earthrealm itself. But the problem is that her practical disposition doesn&#x27;t match up with her wildly unrealistic rendering,&quot; while also criticizing her &quot;MK9&quot; costume, describing it as &quot;probably the [game&#x27;s] biggest offender&quot; among the game&#x27;s revealing female outfits, especially in regards to the cleavage area.

On the other hand, similar to some of the other female characters in &quot;MK11&quot;, Sonya has received some backlash for her design in the game. Princess Weekes from The Mary Sue countered this with stating &quot;The impulse of some to blame &#x27;feminists&#x27; for ruining Sonya is really laughable because all it does is prove something that these same people want so desperately to disprove: They’re just sexist and don’t care about the actual characters,&quot; while arguing that she and other female characters still have &quot;sexy&quot; costumes in the game. Ronda Rousey&#x27;s voicing of Sonya in &quot;MK11&quot; received criticism. &quot;Vice&quot; writer Danielle Riendeau described her performance as &quot;terrible,&quot; and expressed &quot;Sonya Blade made me excited that I could play as a girl in a fighting game. And in her first incarnation, she wasn’t a wildly sexualized adolescent fantasy.&quot;

<doc id="1103963" wikidata="Q6746143" url="?curid=1103963" title="Man @ Work">
<text>Man @ Work is the eighth studio album by Scottish Australian singer Colin Hay, released by Compass Records in July 2003.

==Overview==
The album is a career-retrospective for Hay: he is best known as the lead singer for the 1980s Australian pop band Men at Work, and roughly half of the songs on this album are Hay&#x27;s solo studio renderings of works from the Men at Work catalog, while several others are remixes or re-recordings of material from his solo albums. Some songs are almost identical to the original recordings (e.g. &quot;Be Good Johnny&quot;) while others are complete reinterpretations (e.g. acoustic versions of &quot;Down Under&quot; and &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot;).

The album concludes with a version of &quot;Down Under&quot; recorded with the group Wild Clams.

The album was re-released on vinyl in 2014 with different tracklisting replacing several tracks with new ones.

==Reception==

AllMusic gave a mostly negative review of the album, saying of the Men at Work covers that &quot;While such acoustic Men at Work tracks as &quot;Overkill&quot; and &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot; are quite charming and worth hearing, the pointless re-recordings of &quot;Be Good Johnny&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mistake&quot; (which are almost identical to the originals) are pretty darn pointless.&quot; They summarized his solo reworkings as &quot;worth hearing, but of course, they&#x27;re not up to the high &quot;Business as Usual&quot; standards.&quot; They concluded that the album &quot;will only be of interest to the hardest of hardcore Colin Hay fan.&quot;

The Associated Press wrote that, &quot;In the best possible sense, &quot;Man @ Work&quot; is like Colin Hay&#x27;s cover version of his own greatest hits album.&quot;

<doc id="1103969" wikidata="Q7971471" url="?curid=1103969" title="Washday at the Pa">
<text>Washday at the Pa is a New Zealand illustrated children&#x27;s book by photographer Ans Westra that describes a day in the lives of a rural Māori family. The book was first published by the government Department of Education in 1964 and distributed to primary schools as a bulletin.

The bulletin was quickly recalled, following criticism that its depictions of the poor, rural family were bad for Māori, especially as the primary audience was young children. This decision led to both public and academic discussion over censorship in the following decades. 

Soon after its recall from schools, the book was reprinted privately, this time for adults and on the artistic merits of Westra&#x27;s photography. This new edition featured additional images that were not included in the short children&#x27;s book, and some text was revised. 

A third edition was released in 2011, with new images from Westra&#x27;s meeting again with the family in 1998. 

== Publication, withdrawal and republication ==
Westra visited with and photographed rural Māori throughout the country for five months, and, in 1964, &quot;Washday at the Pa&quot; was published as a school bulletin by the school publications section of the Department of Education. The bulletin was printed by the government printer, and 38,000 copies were distributed to primary school classrooms throughout New Zealand for use in standards two to five. Editors James K. Baxter and Alistair Campbell of the School Publications had expressed &quot;doubts about the acceptability of the photographs to Māori&quot; prior to publication, but the book was published anyway.

The bulletin tells a visual story of daily life for a Māori family at their rural home. The family was given the fictitious name &quot;Wereta&quot;, and described as living &quot;near Taihape&quot; to protect their identities, though the home was actually in Ruatoria, near Gisborne. Scenes focus largely on the family&#x27;s nine children, mostly playing or getting into mischief, as well as some scenes of domestic chores, and &quot;Mr Wereta&quot; shearing sheep. The rural home had no running water or electricity, and one photograph shows a young girl, Mutu, standing on a wood fire stove to warm her feet. This photo drew particular attention because according to Māori custom (), feet should never come into contact with areas where food is prepared. 

The living conditions of the family were seen as poor, and their rural home rundown. Concerns were raised by the Māori Women&#x27;s Welfare League that the depiction of the Weretas would lead readers—impressionable children—to see the family and their living conditions as representative of all Māori. A campaign by the league had it that the book would have a &quot;detrimental effect&quot; on Māori people – and that the living conditions portrayed within the book were atypical. It was claimed that: &quot;the Māori school child is immediately placed at a disadvantage with his European schoolfellows and becomes the butt of their derision&quot;. The league requested the bulletin&#x27;s withdrawal from schools, and in August 1964, soon after its release, the journal was withdrawn by order of the Minister of Education. According to records, all 38,000 copies of the bulletin in schools as well as all unsold copies in the Government Bookshops chain were sent to Wellington, and destroyed, but copies have been seen selling for &quot;hundreds of dollars&quot; online. 

Later in 1964 &quot;Washday at the Pa&quot; was republished privately by the Caxton Press in Christchurch, with this second edition including 20 additional photographs. The original text, also written by Westra, was revised, which led one critic to question whether the intended audience was adults or children, but noting: &quot;from an artistic point of view one cannot fault Ans Westra&#x27;s fine photography&quot;.

A new edition with photographs taken of the same family in 1998 was published by Ans Westra and Mark Amery in 2011.

<text>The Green Mountain Club is a non-profit membership organization dedicated to preserving and protecting Vermont&#x27;s Long Trail. The Long Trail is the oldest long-distance hiking trail in America and stretches from the Massachusetts state line to the Canada–United States border, along the main ridge of the Green Mountains.

==History==
Conceived on March 11, 1910, by James P. Taylor who was at the time the Assistant Headmaster of the Vermont Academy in Windsor, Vermont. Taylor lobbied other Vermont residents who shared his dream of a mission to &quot;make the Vermont mountains play a larger part in the life of the people by protecting and maintaining the Long Trail system and fostering, through education, the stewardship of Vermont&#x27;s hiking trails and mountains&quot;. In 1910, work began on the construction of America&#x27;s first long-distance hiking path known as the Long Trail. The club completed the Long Trail in 1930.

==Today==
With 10,000 members, the club remains responsible for the trail, and is recognized by the state legislature as &quot;the founder, sponsor, defender, and protector&quot; of the Long Trail System.

In addition to being the steward of the Long Trail, the Club&#x27;s advocacy and education efforts also protect Vermont&#x27;s many other hiking trails. Through its land protection program in northern Vermont, the Club has protected almost 80 miles of the Long Trail System, conserved 25,099 acres, and completed 89 land and easement acquisitions since 1986. 
Moreover, The GMC publishes guidebooks, newsletters, and other printed media that serve hikers who wish to walk the Long Trail.

The Green Mountain Club maintains the 272 mile Long Trail in cooperation with the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and private landowners.

The Green Mountain Club also manages the section of the Appalachian Trail that passes through Vermont. The Appalachian Trail follows the Long Trail from the Vermont/Massachusetts state line to Route 4, at which point the Long Trail continues north and the Appalachian Trail heads eastward towards the White Mountains in New Hampshire. The GMC also manages other hiking trails in Vermont&#x27;s Northeast Kingdom region.

==GMC chapters==
The Green Mountain Club separates out into chapters, called &quot;sections&quot; — since they maintain sections of the Long Trail and its side trails — are located throughout the state. Below are a complete list of the GMC chapters:

<doc id="1103981" wikidata="Q6630637" url="?curid=1103981" title="Nicknames of Chicago">
<text>Throughout the history of Chicago, there have been many nicknames for the city of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], Illinois.

==Windy City==
==Second City==
&quot;Second City&quot; originates as an insult from a series of articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by A. J. Liebling, later combined into a book titled &quot;Chicago: The Second City&quot; (1952). In it, Liebling writes about his hatred for Chicago and contrasts it to his hometown New York City. He complains about Chicago&#x27;s economic decline, rampant organized crime and political corruption, declining population, outdated schools of thought, and general dependency on the cities along the east coast. The Chicago-based improv comedy group The Second City references Liebling&#x27;s book in their self-mocking name. In 2011, Chicago announced its adoption of the slogan &quot;Second to None&quot;, a protest stance indirectly referring to Liebling&#x27;s publications. The slogan was replaced with another in 2022.

An etymology popularized by tour guides suggests that it refers to rebuilding the city following the Great Chicago Fire in 1871.

==Chi-town==
&quot;Chi-town,&quot; &quot;Chi-Town,&quot; or &quot;Chitown&quot; ( ) is a nickname that follows an established pattern of shortening a city&#x27;s name and appending the suffix &quot;-town,&quot; like &quot;H-Town&quot; refers to Houston. Despite many mentions by well-known figures in popular works, such as C. W. McCall&#x27;s song &quot;Convoy,&quot; its popularity as a nickname used by locals is disputed. Wendy McClure wrote in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; in 2017 that it is the &quot;cilantro of nicknames&quot;: its distastefulness depends on who is using it. Events and organizations often use the nickname, for example, the hockey team Chi-Town Shooters, the WCW event Chi-Town Rumble, and the New Year&#x27;s Eve event Chi-Town Rising.

==City of Big Shoulders==
&quot;City of Big Shoulders&quot; is a nickname coined by Carl Sandburg in his 1914 poem &quot;Chicago,&quot; which describes the city as &quot;stormy, husky, [and] brawling.&quot; It is the last of several nicknames in the poem; the others hint at the city&#x27;s major industrial activities, for example, the meat-packing industry and railroad industry. It is also sometimes said as the &quot;City of Broad Shoulders.&quot;

==Chiberia==
&quot;Chiberia&quot;a portmanteau of &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Siberia&quot; was coined by Richard Castro, a meteorologist working for the National Weather Service, during a cold wave in 2014 that brought the coldest temperatures to the city in multiple decades. The National Weather Service used the hashtag &quot;#Chiberia&quot; during its reporting on the cold wave. The nickname continues to be used during cold weather events, for example in 2017 and in 2019.

==Chiraq==
&quot;Chiraq&quot;a portmanteau of &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Iraq&quot;controversially compares the city (given its crime rates) to war-torn Iraq. Chuck Goudie, a reporter for ABC7 Chicago, asserted that the nickname is based on a Iraq War statistic: from 2003 to 2012, 4,265 people were killed in Chicago, nearly equal to the number of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq in the same period. The origin of the nickname is not definitive, but it saw increasing popularity in usage around the end of the Iraq War. Spike Lee used the nickname as the title of his 2015 film. 

== City in a Garden==
In the 1830s, the government of Chicago adopted the motto &quot;,&quot; a Latin term that translates to &#x27;City in a Garden.&#x27; It is displayed in the city&#x27;s seal. The Chicago Park District adopted a seal in 1934 that contains the Latin phrase , meaning &#x27;Garden in a City.&#x27;

==Great Commercial Tree==
&quot;Great Commercial Tree&quot; comes from the lyrics of the state anthem of Illinois: &quot;...  Till upon the inland sea, stands thy great commercial tree...&quot;

==Other nicknames==

* &quot;Mud City&quot; – possibly the oldest nickname for the city, referring to the fact that the terrain of the city used to be a mud flat
* &quot;City by the Lake&quot; – used as early as the 1890s
* &quot;The City that Works&quot; – slogan from Richard J. Daley&#x27;s tenure as mayor, describing Chicago as a blue-collar, hard-working city, which ran relatively smoothly
* &quot;Heart of America&quot; – Chicago is one of the largest transportation centers in America, and its location was once near the center of the United States.
* &quot;The Great American City&quot; – taken from Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Norman Mailer&#x27;s book &quot;Miami and the Siege of Chicago&quot; (1968): &quot;Chicago is the great American city ... perhaps [the last] of the great American cities&quot;; &quot;the notion that Chicago is arguably the most quintessential American city&quot; was central to Robert J. Sampson&#x27;s landmark research on communities, criminology, and urban sociology, &quot;Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect&quot; (2012)
* &quot;The City Beautiful&quot; – a reference to the eponymous reform movement sparked by the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, used by Hawk Harrelson when the Chicago White Sox open a game at U.S. Cellular Field
* &quot;The 312&quot; – a reference to the city&#x27;s original area code under the North American Numbering Plan before the overlays of area code 773 and later area code 872.
* &quot;Paris on the Prairie&quot; - a name from Daniel Burnham&#x27;s &quot;Plan for Chicago&quot;.

<doc id="1103984" wikidata="Q1132203" url="?curid=1103984" title="Liz Allan">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Allan, also known as Elizabeth Allan-Osborn and commonly misspelled as &quot;Liz Allen&quot;, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. In the character&#x27;s earliest appearances, she was a popular girl at the high school Peter Parker attends. She has been a regular supporting character in the various Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Venom series in an on-and-off basis, and has ties to the Green Goblin and Molten Man. She is married to Harry Osborn, the mother of their son Normie Osborn, and the CEO of Alchemax. Liz Allan later becomes Misery after bonding to portions of the Anti-Venom and Carnage symbiotes.

Sally Livingstone portrays Liz Allan in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002), while Laura Harrier portrayed Liz Allan in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021).

==Publication history==
Liz Allan is named in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #4 (September 1963), the same issue in which Betty Brant first appears. However, an unnamed blonde female high school student in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962) appears to be Liz Allan, and &quot;The Marvel Encyclopedia&quot; lists this as her official first appearance. She was a supporting character in the series until &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #28 (September 1965), which bids farewell to Liz as both she and Spider-Man graduate from high school.

Nearly a decade later, Liz Allan was brought back in a story arc in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #132-133 (May–June 1974), in which it is revealed that she is the Molten Man&#x27;s stepsister. Writer Gerry Conway recalled, &quot;I liked doing callbacks to the run I was most influenced by, the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era, so bringing Liz back was something I&#x27;d wanted to do for a long time. And it gave me a reason to go back and look through the issues she was in, which brought me to the Molten Man&#x27;s first appearance.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
Liz Allan was a high school student at Midtown High School and a minor love interest of Peter Parker and Flash Thompson.

Peter likes Liz, but she is Flash&#x27;s girlfriend and considers Peter something of a loser, even taking part in the general ridicule that Peter endures on a daily basis. Her earliest appearances depict her as flighty and rather thoughtless - not outright cruel, but lacking the empathy necessary to perceive Peter&#x27;s nature.

However, after she hears an ailing Peter had donned a Spider-Man costume to save Betty Brant from Doctor Octopus, she develops a crush on him. By this time, however, Peter&#x27;s interest has waned considerably, as he notes that Liz never showed any real interest in him until he began dating Betty Brant, and assumes that Liz&#x27;s feelings are little more than a schoolgirl crush. Betty and Liz clash several times over Peter, as Betty mistakenly thinks that Peter reciprocates Liz&#x27;s interest in him.

In &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #28 (September 1965), Peter and Liz graduate from high school. At the graduation ceremony, Liz admits her feelings to Peter, and says she accepts the fact that her feelings are unrequited. In the same issue, Spider-Man battles the Molten Man, who in later issues is revealed to be Liz&#x27;s stepbrother, Mark Raxton.

She does not appear for a few years, during which time Peter developed relationships with Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson. When Liz returns, she dates then marries Harry Osborn, whom she meets at Betty Brant&#x27;s wedding to Ned Leeds, becoming Liz Allan Osborn. The couple have a son, Normie Osborn. Their family history turns tragic, however, after Harry Osborn has a mental breakdown. In the guise of the Green Goblin, Harry kidnaps Liz, Normie, and Mark, and terrorizes them within an old family mansion. Liz is deeply traumatized by this experience and falls into a state of denial about her husband&#x27;s problems. Harry&#x27;s madness leads to his death shortly after. Struggling to put Harry behind her, Liz breaks ties with Peter and Mary Jane.

In the graphic novel, &quot;Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil&quot;, Harry attempts to pass the legacy of the Green Goblin down to Normie Osborn but fails due to the efforts of Spider-Man, Mark Raxton, and Ben Urich.

Later, Liz Allan became a supporting character in &quot;Daredevil&quot;, serving as a love interest for lawyer Foggy Nelson. The couple breaks up after Mysterio manipulates Foggy into having an affair in a plot to drive Daredevil insane. Liz feels like Foggy has let her down and ends their relationship.

After Spider-Man publicly reveals his real identity in the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Liz becomes resentful of him, blaming Peter for bringing so much death into their lives. However, after the events of the &quot;One More Day&quot; storyline, the public revelation of Peter&#x27;s identity has been forgotten and Harry is seemingly still alive, but he and Liz are no longer married.

Liz and Normie are present when the Molten Man is given the antidote to his condition. Raxton, who had escaped the basement in which Liz was keeping him for his own safety, is cured thanks to Oscorp. Liz is last seen attending a party to help Flash Thompson deal with the loss of his legs.

During the 2011 &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Liz is seen trying to leave New York with her son, due to the fear and chaos that is happening, and encounters bank robbers.

Recently, she has been shown in a new alliance with Norman Osborn as he attempts to re-establish himself as a corporate figure - apparently using an alias as his activities as the Green Goblin have made his true name too public, working with him to ensure her son&#x27;s future. Following a confrontation between Spider-Man 2099 and an agent of a time-travel organization from 2211 in the Alchemax Building, Liz has deduced that the &#x27;new&#x27; Spider-Man must work in the company and is determined to enlist him to her cause, foreshadowing the time-traveler&#x27;s claims that Liz Allan and Spider-Man 2099 will have some significant impact on future history.

Liz then appears as the CEO of Alchemax when Eddie Brock enters her office and brings her an experimental dinosaur he captured. She reveals that Stegron is responsible and makes a deal with Brock: she will help him find a cure for the Venom symbiote while he deals with Stegron.

During the &quot;Cult of Carnage&quot; arc, Liz bonds with portions of the Anti-Venom and Carnage symbiotes, transforming her into Misery. Subsequently, she helps battle the Zombiotes during the &quot;Venom War&quot;, using her Anti-Venom abilities to kill them.

When possessed by the Misery symbiote, Liz Allan has the powers and weaknesses of the symbiote.

<doc id="1103986" wikidata="Q7997127" url="?curid=1103986" title="Who's your daddy?">
<text>Who&#x27;s your daddy? is an American slang expression that, in one use, takes the form of a rhetorical question. It is commonly used as a boastful claim of dominance over the intended listener. It may also be a part of role play between intimate partners or as a claim of sexual dominance.

According to the Historical Dictionary of American Slang, the phrase dates back to 1681, when sex workers would use it to ask each other who their procurer was. Its modern popularity has been attributed to its frequent use in sexually suggestive skits broadcast in the 1980s by radio shock jock Doug Tracht; Tracht states he heard the term in the 1968 song &quot;Time of the Season&quot; by The Zombies in a non-sexual manner (&quot;What&#x27;s your name? Who&#x27;s your daddy? Is he rich like me?&quot;) and &quot;converted it to have a spicy connotation&quot;. The phrase is used in countless films and televisions shows, and is also used as a title for various forms of media including video games and songs.

<doc id="1103987" wikidata="Q963735" url="?curid=1103987" title="Rozalia Galiyeva">
<text>Rozaliya Ilfatovna Galiyeva (; born 28 April 1977), also known as Roza Galieva, is a retired artistic gymnast who competed in the 1992 Summer Olympics and 1996 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
Galiyeva was born on 28 April 1977 in Olmaliq, Uzbek SSR (now Uzbekistan). She became a Russian citizen in 1995. With her husband Mikhail, she has one son, Nikita, and one daughter, Tatyana.

==Career==
===1991 to 1994===
Galiyeva began competing internationally for the USSR in 1991, sharing in the team gold medal at the 1991 World Championships in Indianapolis.

She competed with the Unified Team at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. She exceeded expectations in the preliminary competition, finishing 8th and qualifying for the individual all-around final behind teammates Svetlana Boguinskaya and Tatiana Lysenko.

However, before the all-around, coach Alexander Alexandrov pulled Galiyeva from the competition, citing a knee injury. Her replacement was teammate Tatiana Gutsu. Although Gutsu had fallen from the balance beam in the team finals, she was renowned for her extreme difficulty and the reigning European all-around champion and a Worlds medalist on bars and beam. It was later revealed that Galiyeva&#x27;s injury was non-existent, and that the substitution was made because Gutsu was considered to have better medal-winning potential. Indeed, Gutsu emerged from the Olympic all-around as the gold medalist. While Gutsu split her prize money with Galiyeva, Galiyeva always remained angry about this turn of events.

After the 1992 Olympics, Galiyeva competed for Uzbekistan.

===For Russia===
After receiving Russian citizenship in 1995, Galiyeva began competing for the Russian team. Her first major meet for Russia was the European Championships in 1996 where she won gold on balance beam, beating such renowned gymnasts as Gina Gogean and former teammate Svetlana Boguinskaya, who was now competing for Belarus.

As the only returning Olympian, Galiyeva was named team captain of the Russian squad at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. However, these Olympics would also prove to be less than positive for her. The Russian squad was disappointed in the team finals, where they finished second to the United States after leading for the first half of the competition. Galiyeva, along with other gymnasts such as Lavinia Miloșovici, Simona Amânar and Svetlana Khorkina, were distracted by the rowdy American crowd. In the team finals, Galiyeva competed on floor exercise just after Kerri Strug&#x27;s vault that won the gold for the USA; the cheering crowd watched Galiyeva with more attention than they had her teammates, but the spotlight was elsewhere. The situation was repeated two days later in the all-around finals, when Galiyeva was performing, again on floor exercise, while American favorite Shannon Miller was on balance beam, and Galiyeva could not properly hear her music over the deafening crowd noise when Miller&#x27;s impressive routine ended, and again when the score was flashed.

Individually, Galiyeva finished in the top 10 (7th) in the all-around competition, fulfilling her goal to compete, but again she was disappointed. A balance beam medal seemed easily in her reach in event finals (her team optionals and all-around beam scores would have been enough to tie her for first and second respectively). However, although she started confidently and at first looked to be a contender for the gold, she fell on a front somersault near the end of her routine and finished in 7th place on that event. She had also earned a slot in the event finals for vault, but finished just shy of a medal there, in 4th.

After Atlanta, Galiyeva participated in exhibition tours and competitions in the United States. Her last major competition was the World University Games in 1997.

===Post-competitive career===
After retiring from competition, Galiyeva performed in an ice skating show, Moscow Circus on Ice, and judged gymnastics competitions in Russia.

<text>Lidiya Yakovlevna Ginzburg (; March 18, 1902, Odessa, Russian Empire – July 17, 1990, Leningrad, USSR) was a major Soviet literary critic and historian and a survivor of the siege of Leningrad. 

==Biography==

She was born in Odessa in 1902 into the family of an engineer and moved to Leningrad in 1922. She enrolled there in the State Institute of the History of the Arts, studying with Yury Tynyanov and Boris Eikhenbaum, two major figures of Russian formalism. Ginzburg survived the purges, the 900-day Leningrad blockade, and the anti-Jewish campaign of the late 1940s and early 1950s and became a friend and inspiration to a new generation of poets, including Alexander Kushner.

She published a number of seminal critical studies, including &quot;Lermontov&#x27;s Creative Path&quot; (&quot;Tvorcheskii put&#x27; Lermontova,&quot; 1940), &quot;Herzen&#x27;s &#x27;My Past and Thoughts&#x27;&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Byloe i dumy&#x27; Gertsena,&quot; 1957), &quot;On Lyric Poetry&quot; (&quot;O lirike,&quot; 1964; 2nd exp. ed. 1974), &quot;On Psychological Prose&quot; (&quot;O psikhologicheskoi proze,&quot; 1971; 2nd rev. ed., 1977), and &quot;On the Literary Hero&quot; (&quot;O literaturnom geroe,&quot; 1979). &quot;On Psychological Prose&quot; was published by Princeton University Press in 1991 in an English translation and edition by Judson Rosengrant, and &quot;Blockade Diary&quot; (&quot;Zapiski blokadnogo cheloveka,&quot; 1984), her memoir of the siege of Leningrad (8 September 1941 - 27 January 1944), was published by Harvill in 1995 in translation by Alan Myers.

<text>Antônio Maria de Araújo Morais, known as Antônio Maria (17 March 1921—15 October 1964), was a Brazilian writer of pop music lyrics as well as radio sports commentator, poet, composer, and chronicler.

==Career==
At 17 he got his first job presenting a musical program at Pernambuco&#x27;s Radio club. In 1940, he arrived in Rio de Janeiro, &quot;with four changes of clothing and five quid in the pocket&quot;, to work as a sports commentator for Radio Ipanema. The job didn&#x27;t last long and he went back to Recife, where he married Maria Gonçalves Ferreira in May 1944. By 1948, he was back in Rio. His family now increased by a son and daughter, Rita and Antônio Maria Filho, he took a position as Rádio Tupi&#x27;s production director, and was also a feature writer for the &quot;O Jornal&quot; newspaper.

Antônio Maria wrote daily features for more than 15 years - a daily account of what was going on in Rio de Janeiro. Up until 1955, his by-line appeared on &quot;Long is The Night - A Noite É Grande&quot;, the &quot;Antônio Maria Report - Jornal de Antônio Maria&quot; and &quot;Copacabana Cop&#x27;s Story - Romance Policial de Copacabana&quot;.

In his Cop&#x27;s Story column, Antônio Maria would frequently interview the protagonists of the moment, right in the police stations and on the streets of Copacabana or in the middle of the night.
Author of advertising jingles, he ended up writing pop music lyrics. In 1952, two of his works: &quot;Menino Grande&quot; and &quot;Ninguém Me Ama&quot;, were Top Ten hits on the Brazilian radio. In 1959, in partnership with Luiz Bonfá, he composed the incomparable hits: &quot;Manhã de Carnaval&quot; and &quot;Samba do Orfeu&quot;.

Antônio Maria lived his life to the full, both in Rio and in Pernambuco. His great friend, Vinicius de Moraes, fondly called him &#x27;Pernambaioca&#x27; (a mixture of Pernambucano - a native of Northeastern Brazil, and Carioca - a native of Rio de Janeiro).

==Death==
Maria died of a sudden heart attack at age 43 on 15 October 1964 outside of a Copacabana restaurant.

<text>The EMD BL2 is a model of diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). A total of 58 units (plus a single BL1) were built between 1947 and 1949. The BL2 was not very successful, as it was unreliable and occupied a gap between carbody and hood units, which resulted in it suffering from the drawbacks of both designs. However, lessons learned from the BL2 were incorporated into EMD&#x27;s next design, the GP7.

==History==
EMD&#x27;s diesel program was well underway by the late 1940s thanks to the success of the company&#x27;s F- and E-units. While the F-units in production were great for moving trains over the railroad, their full-width carbody made it difficult for locomotive crews to see to the rear of the locomotive while switching. This was considered an acceptable sacrifice for a mainline locomotive, which was expected to do little switch work, since the full-width carbody type was considered much more handsome and stylish. By 1948, competitors Alco, Baldwin, and Fairbanks-Morse had introduced road switcher locomotives, which used the narrow hood and full walkway of a switcher locomotive with a longer frame and the high-speed trucks of a road locomotive. These locomotives were successful at displacing steam from secondary services such as local and branch-line work.

EMD developed the BL1, basing it on the F3 and using the same bridge-truss carbody construction as the F-unit (as opposed to the weight-bearing frame of a true road switcher locomotive like the Alco RS-1) with the body cut away behind the cab to provide visibility to the rear. The first BL1 was EMD Demonstrator #499, built in September 1947. The BL1 Demonstrator was EMD Project 89499, thus the 499 Demonstrator number. The BL in the model name stood for &quot;Branch Line&quot;, indicating that EMD felt the locomotive was best suited for light traffic and frequent switching chores. The BL1 was built with a light-weight underframe and draft gear and no multiple unit (MU) capabilities, as it was expected to operate as a single unit. However, MU capability was later added to the BL1.

In response to feedback from the railroads, the visually-identical BL2 was built with a heavier frame and draft gear and MU capability. The production BL2 used the standard Woodward, Inc. electro-hydraulic governor and notched throttle as used in the F3 (as opposed to the air-actuated throttle with which the BL1 was originally built). The BL2 could be equipped with a train-heating steam generator for passenger service, identified by an exhaust stack between the panes of the front windshield. The B&amp;M, C&amp;O and Rock Island ordered such units.

Limiting the locomotive&#x27;s success were several mechanical and ergonomic drawbacks. The BL2 was expensive and time-consuming to build because of its unique carbody design. Rather than being built in small segments which could be moved to another area for final assembly, the BL2 had to be built entirely in once place. The mechanical components in the engine compartment were difficult to access and maintain, reducing its appeal among railroad shop crews. The locomotive&#x27;s carbody lacked the full-length walkways of a true switch engine (a mistake not repeated on the subsequent &quot;GP&quot; series of diesels or other road switchers), making it difficult for the brakeman or switchman to move from one point on the locomotive to another during switching operations. Finally, although the industrial designers at EMD tried to build a carbody that evoked high-class passenger trains while retaining the utilitarianism of railroad work, the design never became popular. EMD applied the lessons learned from the BL2&#x27;s lack of success in developing the GP7.

<text>The Ministry of Education () is the public service department of New Zealand charged with overseeing the New Zealand education system.

The Ministry was formed in 1989 when the former, all-encompassing Department of Education was broken up into six separate agencies.

== History ==

===Picot report===
The Ministry was established as a result of the Picot task force set up by the Labour government in July 1987 to review the New Zealand education system. The members were Brian Picot, a businessman, Peter Ramsay, an associate professor of education at the University of Waikato, Margaret Rosemergy, a senior lecturer at the Wellington College of Education, Whetumarama Wereta, a social researcher at the Department of Maori Affairs and Colin Wise, another businessman.
The task force was assisted by staff from the Treasury and the State Services Commission (SSC), who may have applied pressure on the task force to move towards eventually privatizing education, as had happened with other government services. The mandate was to review management structures and cost-effectiveness, but did not include curriculum, teaching or effectiveness. In nine months the commission received input from over 700 people or organisations.

The Picot task force released its report &quot;Administering for Excellence: Effective Administration in Education&quot; in May 1988.
The report was critical of the Department of Education, which it labelled as inefficient and unresponsive.
The task force conceived of the school charter as a contract between school boards, the local community and central authority and the government accepted many of the recommendations subsequently published in their response – &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Schools&quot;. This recommended a system where each school would be largely independent, governed by a board consisting mainly of parents, although subject to review and inspection by specialized government agencies. Another recommendation was that boards of trustees were made responsible to the Minister of Education, who gained the power to dismiss boards.

The Picot report became the basis for a drawn out process of educational reform in New Zealand starting in 1989. When National was elected in October 1990, it carried out a further series of educational reviews culminating in the publication &quot;Education Policy: Investing in People, Our Greatest Asset&quot;. This resulted in further modifications to the structure of education reform, and according to one academic, created &quot;a system which is a far cry from the Picot intentions... There has been an ongoing series of changes and reassessments that has caused chaos, confusion and massive insecurity throughout the education sector&quot;.

===Early 21st century===
In recent years the Ministry of Education has made extensive changes to curriculum standards for young New Zealanders to improve education quality. The Ministry stated these changes were made to enhance a more holistic and student-centred learning style and approach towards a better future for children.

In 2023, the Government announced a temporary hold on these educational developments as there is a focus from the government to invest more attention to literacy and maths in the New Zealand curriculum.

In April 2024, the Ministry announced that 565 jobs would be cut to meet the National-led coalition government&#x27;s directive for government departments and agencies to reach budget savings of up to 7.5%.

==Responsibilities==
The Ministry&#x27;s role is to &quot;shape an education system that delivers equitable and excellent outcomes&quot;. It is not an education provider. That role is met by licensed early childhood services, individual elected Boards of state schools, the proprietors of State-integrated schools, registered private schools and tertiary education providers. The Ministry has numerous functions – advising government, providing information to the sector, providing learning resources, administering sector regulation and funding, and providing specialist services. The Ministry works with other education agencies including the Education Review Office, the New Zealand Qualifications Authority, the Tertiary Education Commission, Education New Zealand, and the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.

Within the Ministry of Education, it has a sector called Te Mahau created in 2021. The creation of Te Mahau is to provide more services and support for schools and early learning services. It was created after review by Tomorrow Schools that indicated that schools and early services in New Zealand need more accessible and local support. Staff from Te Mahau provide a broad range of services, including leadership, learning support, and teaching resources, while collaborating with teachers from early learning services and schools. Te Mahau is made up of three frontline groups; Te Tai Raro (North), Te Tai Whenua (Central), Te Tai Runga (South).

Although the Ministry&#x27;s primary purpose is to in ensuring equitable and excellent outcomes, it is also the mechanism through which the Government of the day implements its education policy. When government changes aspects of its policy on education, the Ministry is responsible for implementing those changes. Sometimes the Ministry ends up in the difficult position of trying to implement politically induced changes in education policy to which teachers, parents, and school boards may be opposed. Changes introduced by the National Government in 2008–2012 are an example.

In order for the Ministry and the wider education sector to perform its role effectively, it is dependent on taxpayer funding provided by Government. When government increases funding or requires financial cutbacks, this also impacts on the ability of the Ministry to fulfil its role. In 2013, the Government provided about $12.2 billion to fund education in New Zealand. By 2021, the Education budget was some $16.3 billion.

In April 2024, the ministry proposed making 565 redundancies.

<doc id="1104038" wikidata="Q7536146" url="?curid=1104038" title="Skogås">
<text>Skogås is a district of Huddinge Municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden, south of Stockholm along the railroad to the city and harbour of Nynäshamn. In 2016, Skogås had 14,451 inhabitants. The suburb has conjoined with its northern neighbour Trångsund, forming a municipality district with a population of 22,200 people. The largest employer is the commercial centre in Länna.

Sights include the Ågesta Nature Reserve, the lakes Drevviken, Magelungen and Orlången, the congregations church Mariakyrkan, Trångsund Manor and the upper secondary school &quot;Östra Gymnasiet&quot;. Beatebergsanstalten, a jail for minor offenders, is located in the northwest of Skogås.

Skogås is served by line 43 of the Stockholm commuter rail, and is 20 minutes from Stockholm City Station. Swedish national road 73 passes Skogås on its way to Nynäshamn.

The name Skogås comes from the two words &quot;skog&quot; &#x27;forest&#x27; and &quot;ås&quot; &#x27;ridge&#x27;; hence &quot;the forest-covered ridge&quot;, reflecting Skogås&#x27;s topography of hills, ridges and valleys.

== History ==
Skogås started its history as a cottage summer retreat outside the capital but was given town-like structures during the 1960s, when the town-centre containing some 30 shops was finished. During the 1980s a large settlement of rowhouses (the largest in the country) was added in the eastern part of the suburb and since then, several areas of villas and one-family houses have increased the population greatly.

Since 1997, there has been an urge in Skogås and Trångsund to leave Huddinge Municipality, and form an own municipality. The major idea for the name of such a new municipality would be Drevviken, named after the adjacent lake. A local political party, Drevvikenpartiet, was formed before the 1998 elections, and a referendum was held in all of the municipality, with a majority for leaving in the Skogås-Trångsund area, and a majority for them staying in the rest of Huddinge.

After the 2006 elections, neither the socialist or non-socialist parties gained a majority in Huddinge municipality, and Drevvikenpartiet joined a coalition with the non-socialist parties in exchange for the promise of a new referendum on April 20, 2008. This referendum was to be held in Skogås and Trångsund only, but this time the no-side won quite clearly, 58.8% no and 40.1% yes.

<doc id="1104040" wikidata="Q1800679" url="?curid=1104040" title="Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands">
<text>The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), also known as Operation Helpem Fren, Operation Anode and Operation Rata (by New Zealand), began in 2003 in response to a request for international aid by the Governor-General of Solomon Islands. &quot;Helpem Fren&quot; means &quot;help a friend&quot; in Solomon Islands Pidgin. The mission officially ended on 30 June 2017.

== Causes for unrest ==

Deep-seated problems of land alienation dating from colonialism, unresolved after independence, led to a number of compensation claims on land use; and ethnic violence between 1998 and 2003.

&quot;The Honiara Peace Accord that was signed by the warring parties (Guadalcanal and Malaita), the government and the Commonwealth Special Envoy (Major General Sitiveni Rabuka) recognised several root causes of the conflict:

*Land demands – Guadalcanal leaders wanted all alienated land titles, which had been leased to government and to individual developers, to be returned to landowners (including any other land acquired illegally).
*Political demands – Guadalcanal wanted the establishment of a state government in order to have control over: the sale or use of local land; the distribution of wealth derived from local natural resources; and the migration of people in and out of the province.
*Compensation demands – Guadalcanal wanted payment for the lives of its indigenous people, who have been brutally murdered for their lands or for other reasons.&quot;

The warring parties mentioned were mainly the Solomon Islands Government, the Isatabu Freedom Movement and the Malaita Eagle Force led by, among others, Jimmy Rasta and Harold Keke.

== International response ==

A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by Australia (under the Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force name &quot;Operation Anode&quot;) and New Zealand, and with representatives from about six other Pacific nations began arriving on 24 July 2003.

Nick Warner assumed the role of Special Coordinator as leader of RAMSI, working with the Solomon Islands Government and assisted by a New Zealand Deputy Special Coordinator, Peter Noble, and Fijian Assistant Special Coordinator, Sekove Naqiolevu. Major contributing nations to RAMSI include Australia (which directed the operation), Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Tonga. Pacific countries contribute to RAMSI including Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Personnel from the Pacific countries are predominantly police officers served as part of RAMSI&#x27;s Participating Police Force (PPF).

Initially, the commander of &quot;Combined Task Force 635&quot; (CTF 635) – the military element of the Mission – was Lieutenant Colonel John Frewen, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR), and the deputy commander Major Vern Bennett, New Zealand Army, from Linton. The Land Component included HQ 2 RAR from Townsville, 200 Australian infantry from 2 RAR, a Fijian rifle company, probably from 3 Fiji Infantry Regiment, Queen Elizabeth Bks, Suva, and a Pacific Islands Company, under an Australian Company commander, with Tongan, PNG, and Australian rifle platoons. Supporting elements included eight Iroquois Helicopters, four each from 3 SQN, Royal New Zealand Air Force and 171 Operational Support Squadron, Australian Army, a PNG engineer troop, New Zealand engineer and medical elements, an Australian Combat Service Support Team, with some personnel from Army level troops from Sydney plus logistics personnel from New Zealand, and four Australian Project Nervana Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for surveillance.

In 2004, James Batley took over as Special Coordinator, followed by Tim George in late 2006. In 2005 New Zealander Paul Ash became Deputy Special Coordinator, followed by Dr Jonathan Austin in 2007. Mataiasi Lomaloma succeeded Naqiolevu as Assistant Special Coordinator in late 2005.
Military personnel provide security, material and logistical assistance to police forces assisting the Solomon Islands Government in the restoration of law and order. From November 2003, the military component was reduced, as stability gradually returned to the country, and a sizeable civilian contingent, composed of economists, development assistance specialists and budget advisors commenced the reconstruction of the government, economy and finances of Solomon Islands. The civilian contingent is now made up of around 130 personnel from many pacific countries, the most sizeable being Australia and New Zealand. Early successes included the stabilisation of government finances and normalisation of debt, as well as a number of economic reforms. Civilians in RAMSI are now focussing on capacity building of Solomon Islanders to take over the roles. Difficulties include the lack of available skilled Solomon Islanders.

Former Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was outspoken in his criticism of RAMSI, which he accused of being dominated by Australia and of undermining the Solomons&#x27; sovereignty. By contrast, his successor Prime Minister Derek Sikua has stated he supports RAMSI, and has criticised his predecessor, saying in January 2008: &quot;I think for some time in the last 18 months, the Solomon Islands government was preoccupied with finding fault in RAMSI.&quot; Sikua has stated:
:&quot;[We will] provide leadership that will work closely with RAMSI to achieve clearly stated and agreed objectives for the long-term benefit of Solomon Islands. [...] RAMSI is here on our invitation. [...] [The mission] is important to Solomon Islands as it provides security, development of our police service, and the strengthening of the capacity of government institutions.&quot;

Sikua has also asked RAMSI to assist the Solomons&#x27; rural areas &quot;in the health sector and in the education sector as well as in infrastructure and other sectors to do with income generation and economic activities&quot;.

A documentary film about the tension times and the RAMSI intervention was filmed in 2013, directed by Michael Bainbridge and Mark Power.

== Australian deaths ==
In the early hours of 22 December 2004, Australian Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning was ambushed and killed while on a routine vehicle patrol with another officer in Honiara. Within 24 hours, a Ready Combat Team from the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment was flown into Solomon Islands.

In early January 2005, a joint operation between the Royal Solomon Islands Police (RSIP) and Participating Police Force (PPF) resulted in the arrest of James Tatau. Tatau was charged with Dunning&#x27;s murder, the attempted murder of his colleague, and an earlier shooting incident on a Participating Police Force (PPF) vehicle, in which a bullet narrowly missed two PPF officers. After the arrest, the military presence within RAMSI was again reduced. By 2005, the five troop-contributing nations (Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga) together provided approximately 40 personnel to support the PPF.

Solomon Islanders James Tatau and John Hen Ome were acquitted after standing trial for the killing of Adam Dunning in May 2007.

An Australian soldier, Private Jamie Clark, died in 2005 after falling down a sinkhole while serving as a peacekeeper in Solomon Islands.

== Riots following 2006 general election ==

On 18 April 2006 Snyder Rini was elected Prime Minister of Solomon Islands in a general election. This sparked rioting in Honiara amidst allegations that the election was fixed with the aid of money from Chinese businessmen. Parts of Honiara were razed and looted, with Chinese-owned property particularly targeted. With up to 90% of their shops burnt down in Chinatown, most Chinese have evacuated the country in fear of their personal safety. Snyder Rini resigned on the floor of Parliament on 26 April after just eight days as Prime Minister and as MPs were due to vote on a motion of no confidence against him.

In response, from 20 April 2006, RAMSI forces were rapidly bolstered by a further 220 Australian troops. New Zealand sent a further rifle company and 30 police to increase its RAMSI contribution to around 160 troops and 67 police.

The PPF comprised police officers from 15 Pacific nations: Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Republic of Marshall Islands, Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, Niue, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, Vanuatu, Nauru, Kiribati and Tuvalu.

==2013 military withdrawal==
On 1 July 2013, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Papua New Guinean forces began a &quot;phased redeployment&quot; from Solomon Islands after it was assessed that the security situation in the country had stabilised. The last Australian troops returned to Australia on 1 August 2013. All Australian personnel and equipment were scheduled to be withdrawn by September 2013. After arriving on 24 July 2003, a total of 7,270 Australian personnel deployed during that country&#x27;s support to RAMSI. Of these, 2,122 were Reserve personnel.

== Cost ==
In the year of 2011–12, $43.5 million was spent on the Australian contribution to the RAMSI. In 2014 Jenny Hayward-Jones at the Lowy Institute estimated that Australian government spending on RAMSI as $2.6 billion in real terms to that date.

<text>Jambyn Batmönkh (, ; 10 March 1926 – 14 May 1997) was a half-Mongolian communist political leader and economics professor. He was the leader of Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic from 1984 until its transition into democracy in 1990.

==Early life==
Batmönkh was born in Khyargas sum of Uvs aimag on 10 March 1926. When starting primary school, he took his brother&#x27;s name, Jamba, as a surname. After graduating seventh grade in his native Uvs aimag, he entered the National University of Mongolia&#x27;s two year preparatory program. From 1947 to 1951, he studied at the National University&#x27;s School of Economics.

He met his future wife when they were both 16 years old. Both Batmönkh and Daariimaa were housed in the same dormitory, when they were studying in the National University of Mongolia&#x27;s School of Economics, and the Agricultural Technical College, respectively. They were married one year later. Daariimaa worked for 33 years at the National University of Mongolia Library, until 1988, when she retired.

==Early political career==
Batmönkh became a member of the ruling Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP) in 1948. In 1951, Batmönkh started work as a professor at the Pedagogical University. In 1973, after working as a professor and director at the university for over twenty years, he was promoted to Minister of Science (Superintendent of the Department of Science Education of the Party&#x27;s Central Bureau). In the spring of 1974, he was promoted to Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the MPRP. In June 1974, during a Session of the People&#x27;s Great Khural, he was further promoted to the post of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, an office analogous to Prime Minister.

==Leadership of Mongolia (1984–1990)==
In 1984, along with D. Molomjamts, Batmönkh played a key role in easing Tsedenbal&#x27;s way out of power. In 1984, he became the head of state when the party&#x27;s long-time leader, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, was ousted in a party congress. Batmönkh strengthened Mongolia&#x27;s alliance with the Soviet Union, but as in many other communist countries, there was much pressure for the party to give up power. He also called for the improvement of relations with China, saying during a meeting with President Kim Il Sung while on a state visit to Pyongyang in November 1986 that &quot;renewing the development of Sino-Mongolian relations is important for our two countries’ people&#x27;s common interest&quot;.

Batmönkh&#x27;s reign contributed to the creation of major energy (the construction of Ulaanbaatar and Erdenet power stations, and the connection of the Central high-power electric grid with the Soviet Union&#x27;s Siberian Grid) and mining (the beginning of the operations of Erdenet and Baganuur coal mines, and Bor-Ondor gypsum mine) infrastructure, together with, various other light production and food processing factories.

===Role in the Mongolian Revolution of 1990===

In late 1989, the Democratic movement garnered strength. In March 1990 the first democratic alliance, called Ardchilsan Kholboo (Mongolian Democratic Union), launched a hunger strike urging that the communist government led by Batmönkh resign.

Batmönkh decreed that the only way to end the situation was the resignation of the MPRP&#x27;s Politburo, and maintained a strict policy of never using force. A book was later published with title &quot;Never use force.&quot; After discussions with the members of the Politburo and after the Eighth Congress of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee, the MPRP officially stepped down from power on 9 March 1990.

Batmönkh&#x27;s widow later recounted: &quot;It was March of 1990. Batmönkh was sitting at home, preparing for his speech to the MPRP&#x27;s 8th Congress. The telephone rang, and after speaking a while he suddenly said &quot;We few Mongolians should never make each other&#x27;s noses bleed&quot; and threw the phone away. It was not typical of him, he was a very calm person. He then said &quot;Some leaders have come together and asked me to sign something. I&#x27;ll go there and come back&quot;. He kept asking for his tie, not seeing that it was right next to him. To think about it now, he was very flustered and nervous. He went out without eating, just drinking a cup of tea at the door. I stayed at home, nervous that the protestors had clashed outside. In reality, they (others in Politburo and in authority) had asked him to sign a draft of a decree to crack down and scatter the protest outside. People who were present there later recalled that Batmönkh said &quot;I will never sign this. We few Mongols have not yet come to the point that we will make each other&#x27;s noses bleed,&quot; smacked the table, and left the room.&quot;

&quot;He had resigned by the time he came home that evening. He didn&#x27;t say what happened to me in detail. He was never a person to talk much about work. He was a very calm person,&quot; his widow said.

==After retirement==
In 1990, most of his family members became unemployed after being accused of political corruption. He and his wife made bread and sold deel and gutals. From 1992 until his death, he lived in Dambadarjaa (Sukhbaatar district) while planting vegetables and fruits.

He was privately critical of the new administration (particularly of Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, the new president) after his retirement. He died in 1997.

== In popular culture ==
Batmönkh&#x27;s role in the 1990 democratic movement was dramatized in the 2016 Mongolian film &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget&quot; (&quot;Бүү март&quot;).

<doc id="1104070" wikidata="Q2341186" url="?curid=1104070" title="Claude Farrère">
<text>Claude Farrère (), pseudonym of Frédéric-Charles Bargone (; 27 April 1876, in Lyon – 21 June 1957, in Paris), was a French Navy officer and writer. Many of his novels are based in exotic locations such as Istanbul, Saigon, or Nagasaki.

One of his novels, &quot;Les Civilisés&quot;, about life in French colonial Indochina, won the third Prix Goncourt for 1905. He was elected to a chair at the Académie Française on 26 March 1935, in competition with Paul Claudel, partly thanks to lobbying efforts by Pierre Benoit.

==Biography==
Initially, Claude Farrère had followed his father, an infantry colonel who served in the French colonies: He was admitted to the French Naval Academy in 1894; was made lieutenant in 1906; and was promoted to captain in 1918. He resigned the next year to concentrate on his writing career.

Claude Farrère was a friend and was partly mentored by two other famous French writers of this period, i.e. Pierre Louÿs and Pierre Loti, the latter having been as well a former Navy officer and a writer of books based in overseas countries and cultures. Farrère was a prolific writer, and many of his books are based on his overseas travels and on exotic cultures, especially in Asia, the Orient and North Africa, partly based on his travels when he was an officer with the French Navy. His works have now largely fallen from favour, even among French readers, although some of his most famous books, such as &quot;Fumée d&#x27;opium&quot;, &quot;Les Civilisés&quot;, &quot;La Bataille&quot; or &quot;Les hommes nouveaux&quot; have been republished in France at the end of the 20th century and the early 21st century.

One anecdotal and indirect reference to Claude Farrère is the perfume &quot;Mitsouko&quot; created by the long-lived perfumer Jacques Guerlain, with whom Claude Farrère was a friend. Mitsouko&#x27;s story is found in Farrère&#x27;s novel &quot;La Bataille&quot; (The Battle, 1909), which is a romance based upon Japan&#x27;s modernization and westernization during the Meiji period and upon the 1905 naval Battle of Tsushima when the Imperial Japanese Navy defeated the Russian Imperial Navy. Mitsouko was a beautiful Japanese woman whose name meant both &#x27;honey comb&#x27; and &#x27;mystery&#x27;, who was married to a noble Japanese Navy officer and had an ill-fated love affair with an English officer. &quot;La Bataille&quot; was translated in several foreign languages, including Serbian by Veljko M. Milićević under the title &quot;Boj&quot; (The Battle), published in Sarajevo in 1912. Another Serbian author, Jelena Skerlić translated Farrère&#x27;s &quot;Dix-sept histoires de marins&quot; (1914) under the title &quot;Iz mornarskog života: priče&quot; also published in Sarajevo in 1920.

Farrère&#x27;s name has also been given to &quot;Klod Farer Caddesi&quot; (as spelled in Turkish), a street in Sultanahmet, Istanbul for his favourable description of Turkish culture and Turks. Orhan Pamuk&#x27;s publisher, İletişim Publishing, is situated on this street

A number of Farrère&#x27;s novels were translated and published under his real name, Frédéric-Charles Bargone.

On 6 May 1932, at the opening of a Paris book fair at the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild, Farrère was in conversation with French President Paul Doumer when several shots were fired by Paul Gorguloff, a Russian émigré. Doumer was fatally wounded. Farrère wrestled with the assassin until the police arrived.

As a traditionalist conservative intellectual, he sympathized with the Rebel faction and the Francoist dictatorship in Spain, and he also was one of the French Academy members that actively supported the collaborationist Vichy Regime, helping to legitimize Marshal Pétain&#x27;s authority. Farrère denounced the “bad shepherds” that, according to him, led prewar French society to “decadence”.

<text>Carolyn D. Wright (January 6, 1949 – January 12, 2016) was an American poet. She was a MacArthur Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, and the Poet Laureate of Rhode Island.

==Background==
C. D. Wright was born in Mountain Home, Arkansas, to a chancery judge and a court reporter. 
She earned a BA in French from Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) in 1971 and briefly attended law school before leaving to pursue an MFA from the University of Arkansas, which she received in 1976. Her poetry thesis was titled &quot;Alla Breve Loving&quot;.

In 1977, the publishing company founded by Frank Stanford, Lost Roads Publishers, published Wright&#x27;s first collection, &quot;Room Rented by A Single Woman&quot;. After Stanford died in 1978, Wright took over Lost Roads, continuing its mission of publishing new poets and starting the practice of publishing translations. In 1979, she moved to San Francisco, where she met poet Forrest Gander. Wright and Gander married in 1983 and had a son, Brecht. The husband and wife were co-editors at Lost Roads until 2005.

In 1981, Wright and Gander moved to Dolores Hidalgo, Mexico, where she completed her third book of poems, &quot;Translation of the Gospel Back into Tongues&quot;. In 1983, they moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where she began teaching at Brown University as the Israel J. Kapstein Professor of English. Over the next 30 years, Wright won many major American literary prizes (including fellowships from the Lila Acheson Wallace, Guggenheim, Lannan, and MacArthur Foundations) while publishing one of the most eclectic bodies of poetic work of her generation. The cyclical erotic and tormented fragments of &quot;Just Whistle&quot; are as distinct from the compressed, sensual narratives of &quot;Translation of the Gospel Back into Tongues&quot; as from the lyrical southern paeans of &quot;Further Adventures with You&quot;. Perhaps her most original and internationally influential publications are the book-length works &quot;Deepstep Come Shining&quot;, &quot;One Big Self&quot;, and &quot;One With Others&quot;. Each developed, in new directions, Wright&#x27;s formally innovative and fundamentally ethical meditations on the South, on race relations, incarceration, and the lives of the unsung. Together, those books helped to define and extend the possibilities for documentary poetics in the twenty-first century. In 2013, Wright was elected a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. Stephanie Burt has described Wright as an Elliptical Poet, but Burt did not use that description in an essay she published as a tribute to Wright just after Wright&#x27;s death. As Joel Brouwer has said, she &quot;belongs to a school of exactly one.&quot;

C.D. Wright died on January 12, 2016, six days after her 67th birthday. Her brother, Warren Wright, reported that she &quot;died peacefully in her sleep of thrombosis, a clot, after an overly long flight from Chile.&quot; At the time of her death, she was living in Barrington, Rhode Island.

==Poetry==

Wright&#x27;s poetry is rooted in a sense of place and time and often employs distinct voices in dialogue, particularly those of the American South. Her work is formally inventive and often documentary in spirit, in the sense that it honors those whose stories or voices might be lost, were it not for her own writing. Her diction mixes high and low to surprising effect, and her range of reference is both broad and deep, including phrases from other languages, allusions to other poems, and pieces of conversation. Her books include precisely distilled lyrics such as those collected in &quot;Tremble&quot; as well as book-length poems beginning with &quot;Just Whistle&quot;, her first collaboration with photographer Deborah Luster.

In a 2001 interview with Kent Johnson, Wright said,

As to my own aesthetic associations—affiliations, sympathies—I have never belonged to a notable element of writers who identified with one another partly because I come from Arkansas, specifically that part of Arkansas known for its resistance-to-joining, a non-urban environment where readily identifiable groups and sub-groups are less likely to form.

In the same interview, she states,

The theoretically-driven San Francisco poets who were in cahoots with poets in New York and conversant with European vanguard movements—they provided me with a need to become critically aware of my back-home ways; sharpened me to a degree. I&#x27;m grateful for the exposure, the education. I am indebted to particular poets&#x27; work from that point in time, but I am not an intellectual in the sense that qualifies or requires me to belong to a manifestoed-group. And of course one comes to take some pride in one&#x27;s own outsider status.

Wright published literary maps of both Rhode Island and Arkansas. Wright&#x27;s later work includes &quot;String Light&quot;; &quot;Deepstep Come Shining&quot;, a book-length poem; and &quot;One Big Self: Prisoners of Louisiana&quot;, another collaboration with photographer Deborah Luster. &quot;One Big Self: An Investigation&quot; contains just the poems. Her poems are featured in &quot;American Alphabets: 25 Contemporary Poets&quot; (2006) and many other anthologies. &quot;One With Others&quot; mixes investigative journalism, history and poetry to explore homegrown civil rights incidents and the critical role her mentor, a brilliant and difficult woman, played in a little-known 1969 March Against Fear in her native Arkansas. Shortly after Wright&#x27;s death in January 2016, Copper Canyon Press published &quot;The Poet, the Lion, Talking Pictures, El Farolito, a Wedding in St. Roch, the Big Box Store, the Warp in the Mirror, Spring, Midnights, Fire &amp; All&quot;, a book of prosimetric essays, and &quot;ShallCross&quot;, a book of both short- and long-form poems.

<doc id="1104074" wikidata="Q7545002" url="?curid=1104074" title="Smith &amp; Wesson Model 22A">
<text>The Smith &amp; Wesson Model 22A is a semi-automatic pistol that was manufactured in Houlton, Maine. The 22A is a full-size pistol with an aluminum alloy frame. The steel barrel has an integrated Weaver style rail (similar to a Picatinny).

This pistol is distinguished by two features: An integral rail along the top edge of the gun permits easy mounting of optical sights and other accessories. The gun&#x27;s alloy frame and alloy-shrouded barrel help keep weight down for a full-sized pistol. 

The Smith &amp; Wesson Model 22S is identical in all respects, except that it has a stainless steel barrel, painted gray.

==Design==
The 22A is a hammer-fired, semi-automatic .22 caliber pistol. The enclosed hammer rotates in the frame, hitting the rear of the firing pin in the slide, which then hits the rim of the chambered round. After chambering the first round by pulling back and releasing the slide, each firing ejects the spent cartridge, cocks the hammer, and then strips a new round from the magazine and loads it into the chamber. The hammer is automatically cocked, and pulling the trigger simply releases it. This results in a lower trigger pull force unlike a double-action pistol where the trigger must first cock the hammer and then release it.

A frame mounted safety switch is present along the left side of the frame in the conventional location to be operated by the user&#x27;s right thumb. Patridge-type target sights are standard on this gun, with the rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation. The front sight is integral with the barrel shroud and is not removable or adjustable. An integral feed ramp at the barrel breech helps assure reliable loading of rounds into the chamber from the magazine.

Later models incorporate a magazine safety that does not permit the gun to fire unless the magazine is fully seated. This feature helps prevent accidental discharge during careless handling especially during cleaning.

The magazine release is located on the front of the grip making it easy to locate and also makes it ambidextrous since it is equally well placed for both right and left handed shooters. This is more of a problem for people with smaller hands where the finger tips may lay on the front of the handle when gripping the gun.

The gun takes down for cleaning via a pushbutton at the front that disengages the barrel from the frame. It is therefore possible to rapidly exchange barrels, for example to switch on and off one with a mounted scope, etc.

There were several variants in terms of available barrel length (4&quot;, 5&quot;, 7&quot;), target grips, and frame colors (gray or black). The stainless steel version (as opposed to the blued steel) was called the 22S.

<text>DART, or Demonstration for Autonomous Rendezvous Technology, was a NASA spacecraft with the goal to develop and demonstrate an automated navigation and rendezvous capability. At the time of the DART mission, only the Roscosmos and JAXA had autonomous spacecraft navigation. Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) was the prime contractor for construction, launch and operation of the DART spacecraft with a project cost of US$110 million (2005). The contract was awarded in June 2001 and the spacecraft was launched on 15 April 2005. The mission ended prematurely, very shortly after an anomalous slow-velocity collision with its target spacecraft, having completed less than half of the original mission autonomous rendezvous objectives.

== Mission ==
DART was launched on a Pegasus rocket into a polar orbit of and has International Designator 2005-014A. The craft is and weighs . The maneuvering system comprised 16 nitrogen-fueled thrusters with three hydrazine-fueled thrusters and a reaction control system including six nitrogen-fueled thrusters from the Pegasus fourth stage, which forms an integral part of the spacecraft. The target spacecraft was an OSC MUBLCOM (Multiple-Path Beyond-Line-of-Sight Communications) prototype communications relay satellite weighing approximately launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 18 May 1999 with International Designator 1999-026B.

After launch, DART successfully achieved orbit and within hours made a rendezvous with the target satellite. The automated systems aboard DART successfully acquired the target and began autonomously approaching it. During proximity operations, multiple malfunctions in navigation, propellant management and collision avoidance programming led to a soft collision with the target and premature destruction and retirement of the DART spacecraft.

DART had no capability for interactive piloting from the ground or for uploading new programming after launch, thus all on-orbit operations were directed by DART itself based upon pre-programmed criteria.

=== Objectives ===
==== Automatic orbital transfer maneuvers ====
The craft autonomously navigated via a series of orbit transfer maneuvers to reach the target satellite. No navigational information was relayed to the vehicle after launch; it navigated autonomously and with GPS.

==== Proximity operations with AVGS ====
Once the spacecraft had navigated to the target satellite, it was to have performed a series of proximity maneuvers. The maneuvers would have demonstrated the capabilities of the AVGS (Advanced Video Guidance Sensor). It was planned to demonstrate station keeping, docking axis approach, circumnavigation, and a collision avoidance maneuver. DART would have then departed the vicinity and retired to a final orbit. The entire sequence was to have been accomplished under autonomous control.

==== Additional demonstrations ====
* Validate ground test results of the AVGS and proximity-operations algorithms 
* Provide hardware capabilities for future missions by validating the AVGS in the space environment 

== Mishap investigation board ==
NASA convened a mishap investigation board to determine the reason for the DART spacecraft anomaly. First reports pointed to the spacecraft running out of fuel before concluding its mission.

On 14 April 2006, NASA announced that they would not release the investigation&#x27;s report, citing that the report includes details protected by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

On 15 May 2006, NASA released a public summary of the DART mishap investigation board report. NASA revealed that a critical navigation failure occurred when the DART and MUBLCOM spacecraft were about 200 meters apart, which precluded the full activation of the AVGS and allowed DART to approach MUBLCOM without accurate ranging information. A later failure of the collision avoidance system, which was relying upon inaccurate position and velocity information, allowed DART to ultimately collide with MUBLCOM at a relative speed of approximately 1.5 meters per second. Both spacecraft survived the collision without apparent damage. Throughout the autonomous proximity operations, DART used its limited propellant faster than anticipated, which caused &quot;a premature end to the mission&quot; 3 minutes 49 seconds after the collision. DART initiated its retirement programming, removed itself from the vicinity of MUBLCOM, and prepared for deorbit. After the collision, MUBLCOM &quot;regained its operational status after an automatic system reset&quot;.

The DART Mishap Investigation Board determined that only 11 of the 27 defined mission objectives were partially or fully met, all of which related to the launch, early orbit, rendezvous, departure, and retirement phases. None of the 14 objectives related to the proximity operations phase were met.

== Atmospheric entry ==
DART re-entered in the atmosphere of Earth around 08:32 UTC on 7 May 2016 over the south Pacific Ocean.

<text>John-Michael Tebelak (September 17, 1949 – April 2, 1985) was an American playwright and director. He is best known for creating the musical &quot;Godspell&quot;, based on the Gospel of Saint Matthew, with the composer Stephen Schwartz, who wrote the music. Some of the lyrics are original to the show, while others were taken from either the Bible or traditional hymns in the 1940 Episcopal hymnal.

==Biography==

=== Education and &quot;Godspell&quot; ===
Tebelak was born in Berea, Ohio and graduated from Berea High School in 1966. His parents were Genevieve and John Tebelak, and he had one sister.

He first produced &quot;Godspell&quot; as his master&#x27;s thesis, under Lawrence Carra, at Carnegie Mellon University in December 1970. He had been studying Greek and Roman mythology, but became fascinated by the joy expressed in the Gospels, with the deadline for his thesis two weeks away. He attended an Easter Vigil service in 1970 at Pittsburgh&#x27;s St. Paul Cathedral, wearing his usual overalls and a T-shirt. A police officer frisked him for drugs after the service. He wrote, of this experience, &quot;I left with the feeling that, rather than rolling the rock away from the Tomb, they were piling more on. I went home, took out my manuscript, and worked it to completion in a non-stop frenzy.&quot; Though he never completed his coursework at the university, Carnegie Mellon did award him a degree.

He then directed productions of &quot;Godspell&quot; at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, the Cherry Lane Theatre, the Promenade Theatre, and on Broadway. He was named Theatre Man of the Year by Elliott Norton of the &quot;Boston Record American&quot;, and Most Promising Director of 1971 by the New York Drama Desk. He was also named an Outstanding Ohioan by then-Governor John J. Gilligan. Following the success of &quot;Godspell&quot;, he contributed funding to a number of productions at La MaMa, including Paul Foster&#x27;s &quot;Silver Queen Saloon&quot; (1978); William M. Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Etiquette&quot; (1978); Steven Margoshes, Gerome Ragni, and James Rado&#x27;s &quot;Jack Sound&quot; (1978); Tadeusz Kantor&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Class&quot; (1979); Winston Tong in two pieces (1979); Andrei Serban and Elizabeth Swados&#x27; &quot;Fragments of a Trilogy&quot;; Rosalyn Drexler&#x27;s &quot;Vulgar Lives&quot; (1979); Meredith Monk&#x27;s &quot;Recent Ruins&quot; (1979); and Ron Tavel&#x27;s &quot;Nutrcracker in the Land of Nuts&quot; (1979/1980).

===After &quot;Godspell&quot;===
Tebelak directed the Broadway play &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; in 1972, the off-Broadway play &quot;The Glorious One&quot; in 1975, and &quot;Ka-Boom!&quot; in 1980. He also directed Lope de Vega&#x27;s &quot;Fuenteovejuna&quot; in Madrid in 1975. He co-wrote the 1973 film version of &quot;Godspell&quot; with David Greene.

Tebelak once said that he &quot;walked into a theatre at the age of nine and stayed there.&quot; He was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, considered becoming a priest, and may have attended an Episcopal seminary for a time. He was dramaturge for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City and staged liturgical drama there. According to Reverend James Parks Morton, &quot;whether it was a sermon series or a two-day conference on the environment, he turned it into theater.&quot;

In 1980, Tebelak was sued in New York State Supreme Court by his former live-in companion, Richard Hannum. Hannum was represented by famed divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, and was working with Norman Mailer on an adaptation of a play about Marilyn Monroe called &quot;Strawhead.&quot; The lawsuit was an early effort to define the rights of cohabiting homosexual couples.

Tebelak returned to his hometown of Berea, Ohio, to direct the 10th anniversary production of &quot;Godspell&quot; at the Berea Summer Theater in the summer of 1980. He subsequently directed &quot;Cabaret&quot; there in the summer of 1981. He directed a revival of &quot;Godspell&quot; at La MaMa in 1981 and then another revival production billed as the 10th anniversary reunion production in Los Angeles in December 1981 with the majority of his original New York cast. In 1983, he directed &quot;Diversions: Or Proof that it is Impossible to Live&quot;, based on the life and work of Franz Kafka, written by Aubrey Simpson, and starring Michael Mayer, at La MaMa.

Tebelak died at his home in Manhattan, New York City on April 2, 1985, of a heart attack.

<doc id="1104090" wikidata="Q3543799" url="?curid=1104090" title="Nipple discharge">
<text>Nipple discharge is fluid from the nipple, with or without squeezing the breast. The discharge can be milky, clear, green, purulent, bloody, or faintly yellow. The consistency can be thick, thin, sticky, or watery. 
Nipple discharge may be normal, such as milk in late pregnancy or after childbirth, and in newborns during the first weeks of life. It may also be normal following squeezing, in women during the reproductive years. It is likely abnormal if it occurs in men, contains blood, is from only one breast, or is associated with a breast lump, swelling, redness or overlying skin changes. Reasons for abnormal discharge include an intraductal papilloma, duct ectasia, blocked milk duct, infected breast (mastitis or breast abscess), breast cancer, certain medications, and conditions that raise prolactin.
Milky discharge in a non-pregnant, non-breast feeding women is evaluated differently to other abnormal nipple discharge. Often, the cause can be determined based on symptoms and examination. Blood tests may be done to rule out low thyroid or high prolactin. Other tests may include mammography, breast ultrasound, breast biopsy, or skin biopsy.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Duct ectasia may be treated with surgical removal of the ducts involved. Infectious causes may require antibiotics or incision and drainage. Nipple discharge is the third most common breast complaint by women, after breast pain and a breast lump. About 3% of breast cancer cases are associated with discharge.

==Signs and symptoms==

Nipple discharge is fluid from the nipple, with or without squeezing the breast. The discharge can be milky, clear, green, purulent, bloody, or faintly yellow. The consistency can be thick, thin, sticky, or watery.

==Causes== 
Nipple discharge can arise from any one or more of the 15 to 20 milk ducts that each breast contains, and its causes can be divided into normal (physiological) and abnormal (pathological). 

===Normal===

Milky liquid from nipples is normal during the last few weeks of pregnancy, after childbirth and during breastfeeding. Some newborn babies may leak a milky liquid which is usually normal and lasts a couple of weeks. 

Stimulation of breasts by massage, using a breast pump or after mammography, may induce yellow, milky, or green nipple discharge in many healthy women of reproductive age.

===Abnormal===
Spontaneous nipple discharge unrelated to pregnancy or lactation is considered abnormal, but mostly have a non-serious cause. Nipple discharge in men is not normal. Discharge from nipples is also more likely to be abnormal (pathological) if it is crystal clear or blood-stained, is from only one breast, or is associated with a breast lump, swelling, redness or overlying skin changes.

A blocked or enlarged milk duct can result in nipple discharge.

Intraductal papillomas are non-cancerous lesions and commonest in women age 30 to 50. Divided into central and peripheral papillomas, nipple discharge is more frequently observed when they are central. Up to half of women with intraductal papillomas may present with bloody nipple discharge, but it can also be straw-coloured. They are usually too small to feel and have a rare association with breast cancer.

15-20% of people with nipple discharge are found to have duct ectasia. This is usually in perimenopausal and menopausal women, who may have associated pain and retraction of the nipple. A lump may also be present.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) usually presents with abnormal findings on mammography, but can less frequently present with a lump or nipple discharge in women, whereas in men with DCIS, nipple discharge is the common presentation.

Infection in a breast, either mastitis or breast abscess may cause a discharge. Eczema of the nipple may result in a discharge with crusting of the nipple skin.

Nipple discharge may be due to breast cancer, particularly if there is an accompanying breast lump. A blood-stained discharge may appear in Paget&#x27;s disease.

===Milky===

Some condition that cause a raised prolactin can result in a milky liquid appearing from nipples. These include endocrine causes such as pituitary and thyroid disease, and some medications. Such medications include: 
*Medication for hypertension: Methyldopa, reserpine, verapamil
*Gastrointestinal agents: Cimetidine, metoclopramide
*Hormones: Estrogen, birth control pill
*Opiates: Codeine, heroin, methadone, morphine
*Psychotropic drugs: Antipsychotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, neuroleptics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants

Some herbs including anise and fennel have also been implicated as causing leaking of fluid from nipples.

==Diagnosis==
The evaluation of milky nipple discharge in a non-pregnant, not breast feeding women is different to the assessment of other abnormal nipple discharge. Often, the cause can be ascertained without performing tests.
When blood tests are requested, they usually include thyroid tests and prolactin to rule out hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia. Other tests that may be considered include mammography, breast ultrasound, CT scan of the head to rule out a pituitary tumour, breast biopsy, x-ray imaging of breast ducts or skin biopsy.

The absence of cancerous cells in samples of nipple discharge does not exclude cancer, hence cytology of the nipple discharge is not usually performed. However, guidance on investigations varies and tests are more likely performed if the discharge is bloody, from one breast, and the woman is age over 50. If the test is performed and malignant cells are found, an underlying cancer is highly likely.

==Treatment==
Initially, an evaluation for cancer is indicated. Treatment will depend on the cause found, and may involve changing medication, having a lump removed, applying a cream to treat a skin condition or being given medication to treat the condition causing the discharge. Duct ectasia may be treated with surgical removal of the ducts involved. Infectious causes may require antibiotics and/or incision and drainage. Sometimes, no treatment is required.

If no abnormality is found, a surgical duct excision may resolve the symptoms. Treatment also depends on whether single-duct or multiple-duct discharge is present, and whether the symptoms of nipple discharge are distressing to the person. In some cases, there may be no need for any further intervention; in others, microdochectomy or a total duct excision may be appropriate. If the person wishes to conserve the ability to breastfeed and only single-duct discharge is present, then ductoscopy or galactography should be considered in view of performing a localised duct excision.

==Epidemiology==
Nipple discharge is the third most common breast complaint by women, after breast pain and a breast lump. 10% of women can notice a nipple discharge when squeezing their breast and more than 50% of women can experience this using a breast pump.

Most abnormal nipple discharge is not associated with breast cancer, but 1-5% of breast cancers present with nipple discharge.

<doc id="1104102" wikidata="Q1096719" url="?curid=1104102" title="Foggy Nelson">
<text>Franklin Percy &quot;Foggy&quot; Nelson is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has been depicted as part of the supporting cast of Daredevil (Matt Murdock); Foggy is Matt&#x27;s best friend and, for most of the series, his law partner. The character was created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett.

Initially, Foggy was portrayed as a deeply conflicted character, continuously caught between his strong vocational disagreements with Matt, their rivalry for the affections of Karen Page, and his loyalty to his friend. Despite being a highly successful lawyer, he is also tormented by feelings of inferiority to his law partner. However, since the early 1980s he has often been reduced to comic relief, and his down-to-earth, everyman lifestyle acts as a contrast to his grim superhero colleague.

For the first couple years of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, Foggy&#x27;s appearance greatly varied from issue to issue, though he was most commonly drawn as a trim, handsome, and neatly groomed young man. Since his first portrayal by Gene Colan, in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #20, he has consistently been drawn as a short, slightly pudgy man with a generally relaxed appearance.

He has been portrayed by Jon Favreau in the 2003 film adaptation.

==Publication history==
Foggy Nelson first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #1 (April 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett.

Foggy Nelson received an entry in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update &#x27;89&quot; #5.

==Fictional character biography==
===The Beginning===
Foggy is Matt Murdock&#x27;s roommate while they study at Columbia Law School. Matt protects Foggy against bullies and helps him study. When Matt begins dating Elektra Natchios, Foggy disapproves, because he thinks she is dangerous. After Elektra leaves the university, Matt and Foggy transfer to Harvard Law School. After graduating, Matt and Foggy open up a private law practice. They hire a secretary, Karen Page, with whom both Matt and Foggy fall in love. Foggy soon realizes that Karen is in love with Matt, and sees him as only a friend, dealing a heavy wound to his ego. He is approached by Abner Jonas to be a third-party candidate for district attorney, and in a party given by Jonas, Foggy meets an old high-school classmate, Deborah Harris. He is smitten with her, and she returns his romantic interest. However, Daredevil uncovers that Jonas is secretly the criminal mastermind The Organizer, that Debbie is Jonas&#x27;s lover, and that her flirtation with Foggy was solely a means to get him under their control. Foggy helps foil the Organizer&#x27;s plans, and Debbie is taken to jail. Nelson is heartbroken and again turns his attentions to Karen Page.

Foggy, unaware of his partner&#x27;s double life as a superhero, is suspicious about Matt&#x27;s sudden and unexplained absences, and his frequent bruises. To avoid those suspicions, Murdock resorts to creating his &quot;twin brother&quot; Mike Murdock (Matt himself in disguise), faking his death, or asking someone else to wear the costume. To Foggy&#x27;s dismay, Karen becomes as enamored of Mike Murdock as she is of his &quot;brother&quot; Matt. To further his frustration with Matt, despite Foggy&#x27;s repeated protests that his preference is for corporate law, his partner favors taking on costumed supervillains as clients, occasionally even leaving Foggy no choice but to represent the supervillain at trial.

===District attorney===
Nelson is again approached to be a candidate for district attorney, this time without hidden agendas: he is very fond of the idea of being able to do something to fight crime actively, and sets himself to work with enthusiasm. Shortly after, Debbie Harris&#x27;s jail term expires, and she immediately gets in touch with Foggy. She and Foggy start to date again, despite Foggy&#x27;s fears that it would be bad for his campaign to date an ex-convict, as well as his doubts as to the motives for Debbie&#x27;s interest in him. While dating her publicly for the first time since her incarceration, Debbie is ransomed to the Time Continuum by the Unholy trio, led by the Exterminator. Foggy and Daredevil investigate, each on his own side. Foggy is made a prisoner by the Exterminator and Daredevil comes to the rescue. A fight ensues and there is an explosion, after which Foggy finds some rags of the DD uniform: it is then assumed that &quot;Mike Murdock&quot; has died. Debbie returns from the Time Continuum and she and Foggy resume their happy relationship.

There is a schism between Matt and Foggy, as due to Matt&#x27;s troubled relationship with Karen, and his own troubles as Daredevil, he does not help Foggy in his campaign. Foggy feels abandoned and Matt is not able to explain without revealing his secret. However, Foggy wins the election, the two reconcile and Foggy offers Matt an opportunity to become assistant to the DA.

Later, Foggy is blackmailed by the mysterious Mr. Kline, and is forced by him to prosecute Black Widow, who is defended by Matt. This again severs their longtime friendship and Matt leaves for San Francisco with the Widow. They again reconcile when Foggy is badly wounded while investigating a criminal conspiracy by Black Spectre, and Matt comes back to New York to help him in his fight against crime.

===The Storefront===
After losing the re-election for District Attorney to Blake Tower (and a slurring campaign against him by Jester, who had earlier failed to coerce Foggy into ending his campaign for district attorney), Foggy resumes his career as counselor, again with Matt, in a free clinic called &quot;The Storefront&quot;. Becky Blake, a law student, is later hired to work as the firm&#x27;s secretary.

Foggy proposes to Debbie, and they are married.

Elektra is hired by the Kingpin to assassinate Foggy. However, upon confronting Foggy, he recognizes her as &quot;Matt&#x27;s girl&quot;. Unable to kill Foggy after this, Elektra abandons her assignment, which leads to her death at the hands of Bullseye.

===The decline and fall of Nelson and Murdock===
Foggy&#x27;s marriage begins to go sour, as he is an easy going fellow whom his wife wants, unsuccessfully, to transform into a high socialite. The jaded Debbie begins having an affair with Micah Synn, chieftain of a savage tribe, and she coerces Foggy to lie in Synn&#x27;s favor. An abusive brute, Synn later takes Debbie prisoner. After escaping, she immediately returns to Foggy, and he publicly admits his lies in order to denounce Synn&#x27;s crimes. Despite this, their marriage is badly damaged and they eventually divorce.

In addition, Foggy&#x27;s behavior in the Synn case damages the Nelson and Murdock firm&#x27;s reputation, and Murdock loses interest in his work and devotes more time to his costumed career. Foggy cannot fight alone against the lack of clients and the cascading of bills, and the Nelson &amp; Murdock premises are closed down. Foggy is so depressed that he considers suicide, but after he is caught in a fight between the Vulture and Daredevil, the immediacy of death makes him realize that he much prefers to be alive.

Following a bad breakup with Matt and a robbery of her apartment, Glorianna O&#x27;Breen turns to Foggy for comfort; he reassures her but rejects her romantic advances out of loyalty to Matt. At the same time, Matt is accused of paying a witness to perjure himself, and Foggy acts as his attorney. Despite a frameup by the Kingpin himself, Foggy gets Matt released without jail time. After the trial, Matt disappears and the Kingpin, impressed by Foggy&#x27;s performance at the trial, has him hired through one of his firms, Kelco. With Matt gone, Foggy begins dating Glorianna while working on an appeal to have Murdock&#x27;s law license reinstated. As Kelco&#x27;s attorney, Nelson defends the company against charges from a boy who was blinded by toxic waste they deposited in rivers. Glorianna is disillusioned with and eventually leaves him. Foggy quits his job with Kelco when he learns that the company is owned by the Kingpin. He and Matt are later reunited, and he helps Matt win back his law license.

When Daredevil&#x27;s identity is outed to the press by an assistant of Ben Urich, Murdock fakes his death. Karen and Foggy later find Matt still alive, in a state of stupor, in his yellow Daredevil uniform but without the mask. Foggy finally realizes Matt&#x27;s secret identity. They reconcile and become law partners again.

===&quot;Sharpe, Nelson &amp; Murdock&quot;===
Rosalind Sharpe, a famous and controversial Boston attorney, offers for Nelson and Murdock to become her associates. It is later revealed that Rosalind Sharpe is Nelson&#x27;s biological mother: she divorced her husband and abandoned her son in order to be able to pursue her career as a lawyer. It was Sharpe&#x27;s career that enticed her son to become a lawyer.

Foggy starts dating Liz Allan, remaining with her through such moments as the &#x27;resurrection&#x27; of her father-in-law Norman Osborn. Later, the villain Mysterio manipulates him into having an affair with another woman, and then makes it appear Nelson murdered the woman after the affair (which Foggy cannot remember clearly as he was drugged by Mysterio). Liz visits Foggy in prison, where he Foggy confesses to cheating on her, and she leaves him. After the machinations by Mysterio are disclosed, Foggy is set free, but he feels bad about having failed Liz, and does not attempt to resume the relationship.

Sharpe fires Foggy, as she does not want the murder affair to bring bad publicity to the firm. When Matt Murdock starts preparing Foggy&#x27;s defense, she orders him to stand down, resulting in Matt quitting the firm out of disgust.

Foggy personally counsels superheroes on diverse occasions, such as when he takes the case of the superhero Vance Astrovik, who killed his abusive father in a fit of rage. Foggy loses the case, as his opposition convinces the jury that Vance could have stopped his father without killing him. Other clients he personally represents are Carol Danvers and the Fantastic Four, to whom he recommends not to accept a buy offer for the FF estate by the Gideon Corporation (although Reed Richards ultimately decides to sell).

===Nelson &amp; Murdock ride again===
In the aftermath of Karen Page&#x27;s murder, Foggy and Matt find themselves without their women and without their jobs. Murdock finds out that he is the sole beneficiary of Karen&#x27;s wealth. He proposes to Nelson to resume their partnership, using the money to build the new premises where Matt&#x27;s old house — blown up by the Kingpin — had once been. Nelson responds with enthusiasm. Rosalind Sharpe tries to contact Foggy to offer him work again, without success.

Matt is revealed to the world as Daredevil and eventually arrested. After Foggy goes to visit Matt in prison with private investigator Dakota North, he is stabbed and seriously injured by several inmates. Foggy is placed in the witness protection program, and officially declared dead sometime after the ambulance takes him away. Foggy recovers from his wounds and assumes a new identity. He attempts to escape in an effort to reunite with Matt, only to be captured by the Mafia, who in turn are slaughtered by ninjas. They return him to his former captors, after informing him that they would be watching.

Foggy, fleeing from his life in protected custody, reaches Matt&#x27;s home and they are reunited. Along with Becky Blake, Foggy successfully clears all of Matt&#x27;s troubles with the Law and the Bar. Murdock and Nelson ask Becky to join their firm as a new partner and move to new quarters, taking only referrals to avoid being easily located by Daredevil stalkers.

===Nelson, Blake and Murdock===
Foggy finds out that Matt made a deal with the Kingpin. Hurt that Matt would not even talk to him before making a deal with a man who has made both their lives miserable, he fires him from the law firm, effectively cutting Matt off from his normal life and making it easier for him to join The Hand. Foggy blames himself for Matt&#x27;s going over the edge.

Foggy is later disbarred due to contempt of court. Foggy goes to visit the judge with Dakota, and they use a compromising photograph to force him to tell the truth about his and Dakota&#x27;s recent misfortunes, and learn that the judge is on the Kingpin&#x27;s payroll. Recognizing these actions were intended to get at Matt, Dakota decides the two of them need to locate Matt. Foggy Nelson arrives at the gates of the Shadowland Fortress and tries to reach Matt verbally, but is ignored. Foggy scales the walls to reach Matt, where he is intercepted by White Tiger. She leads him to Daredevil. Matt decides to kill Foggy, but he is &quot;purged&quot; of the demon controlling him by Iron Fist.

Foggy is reinstated as an attorney and moves his office to a new location (since his previous office was burned down during the riots). He has to run his business by himself after Becky Blake resigns. Foggy helps Black Panther, Matt&#x27;s temporary replacement in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, to establish a new identity for himself by providing him with false immigration papers. Matt returns to Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and assures Foggy that he has found a new place to establish &quot;Nelson and Murdock&quot; and that he should be able fix his problems and get his law license back.

===The new Nelson and Murdock===
While Foggy and Matt start up their private business again, problems arise when the previous allegations of Matt Murdock being Daredevil are brought up during the first case. As a result, they begin training their clients on how they can represent themselves in court. However, Matt is eventually forced to leave New York for good when a case requires him to officially confirm his identity as Daredevil.

===Post-&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
After the reconstruction of reality, Matt assists the Purple Children – the children of his old foe the Purple Man, who have inherited their father&#x27;s powers – and in return, they erase all public knowledge that Matt Murdock is Daredevil. The only person Matt re-reveals his identity to is Foggy, who occasionally resents the pressure this puts him under.

<doc id="1104109" wikidata="Q433381" url="?curid=1104109" title="Domitia (aunt of Messalina)">
<text>Domitia (-June 59) was the oldest child of Antonia Major and Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, and the oldest granddaughter to triumvir Mark Antony by Octavia Minor, a great-niece of the Roman Emperor Augustus, first cousin once removed to the Emperor Caligula (as well as his brother-in-law&#x27;s sister), first cousin to the Emperor Claudius, maternal aunt to the Empress Valeria Messalina, and paternal aunt to Emperor Nero.

==History==
===Early life===
She had two younger siblings: Domitia Lepida and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (cos. AD 32). The date of her birth is not recorded and can be only estimated as no later than 7 BC, but possibly as much as 10 years earlier, if one would allow a long delay between her birth and those of her two siblings.

===Marriages===
Domitia was likely married to a cousin of Sejanus named Quintus Junius Blaesus with whom she had a son named Junius Blaesus who served as a governor under emperor Vitellius. She married the consul Decimus Haterius Agrippa, who died in 32 as a victim of Tiberius&#x27; reign of terror. Domitia bore Agrippa a son, Quintus Haterius Antoninus (cos. AD 53) in approximately 20. In 33 Domitia married the witty, wealthy, and influential Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus. Crispus was the adopted grandson and biological great-great nephew of the historian Sallust. After January 41, Crispus divorced Domitia, so he could marry Domitia&#x27;s former sister-in-law Agrippina the Younger, who had recently returned from exile. Thereby, Crispus became the stepfather of Agrippina&#x27;s son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (Nero), who was Domitia&#x27;s nephew. Crispus soon died mysteriously, leaving a fortune to Agrippina and her son.

Alternatively, Christian Settipani had suggested that Domitia wasn&#x27;t actually married to Blaesus - it was her daughter from marriage to Sallustius Crispus who become a wife of Blaesus&#x27;s son. According to his hypothesis, the marriage between Domitia and Crispus took place earlier, c. 20-25.

===Later life===
During the reigns of Caligula, Claudius and Nero, Domitia was an influential rival to Agrippina. In June 59, she died while confined to a bed with severe constipation. Nero was visiting her at the time, and she commented that when he shaved his beard (a Roman symbolic act, usually performed during a ceremony at the age of twenty-one), she would gladly die peacefully. Nero turned to those with him and joked, &quot;I&#x27;ll take it off at once.&quot; According to a rumor, he then ordered the doctors to administer a fatal dose of laxative to his aunt and seized her property while she was dying. Modern scholars such as Miriam T. Griffin distrust the claim that Nero poisoned her.

<text>The National Debate Tournament is one of the national championships for collegiate policy debate in the United States. The tournament is sponsored by the American Forensic Association with the Ford Motor Company Fund.

==History of the NDT==
The National Debate Tournament (NDT) began in 1947 at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Twenty-nine schools competed at the first NDT debating: &quot;Resolved: That labor should be given a direct share in the management of industry&quot;. It remained at West Point through 1966, at which time the Tournament Director met with the district chairs and advised them that at the tournament banquet of the Military Academy&#x27;s decision to discontinue hosting the NDT in the ensuing years in part because of the increased demands on space and money that the United States&#x27; growing involvement in the Vietnam War was placing on the Academy. 

Since then the tournament has moved to different member schools each year and only three schools have hosted it twice.

Selection of the 78 teams participating at the NDT involves a three stage process.

== Winners ==
== Past Resolutions ==
The National Debate Tournament currently debates the topic selected by the Cross Examination Debate Association, but used to debate its own, separate, topic. Wake Forest University maintains a list of earlier resolutions used at the National Debate Tournament.

<text>In southeastern Russia, an iron meteorite fell on the Sikhote-Alin Mountains in 1947. Large iron meteorite falls have been witnessed, and fragments have been recovered, but never before in recorded history has a fall of this magnitude occurred. An estimated 23 tonnes of fragments survived the fiery passage through the atmosphere and reached the Earth.

== Impact ==

At around 10:30 AM on 12 February 1947, eyewitnesses in the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, Primorye, Soviet Union, observed a large bolide brighter than the sun that came out of the north and descended at an angle of about 41 degrees. The bright flash and the loud sound of the fall were observed for around the point of impact not far from Luchegorsk and approximately northeast of Vladivostok. A smoke trail, estimated at long, remained in the sky for several hours.

As the meteor, traveling at a speed of about , entered the atmosphere, it began to break apart, and the fragments fell together, some burying themselves deep. At an altitude of about , the largest mass apparently broke up in an explosion called an air burst.

On November 20, 1957 the Soviet Union issued a stamp for the 10th anniversary of the Sikhote-Alin meteorite shower. It reproduces a painting by P. I. Medvedev, a Soviet artist who witnessed the fall: he was sitting in his window starting a sketch when the fireball appeared and immediately began drawing what he saw.

== Orbit ==
Because the meteor fell during the daytime, it was observed by many eyewitnesses. Evaluation of this observational data allowed V. G. Fesenkov, then chairman of the meteorite committee of the USSR Academy of Science, to estimate the meteoroid&#x27;s orbit before it encountered the Earth. This orbit was ellipse-shaped, with its point of greatest distance from the sun situated within the asteroid belt, similar to many other small bodies crossing the orbit of the Earth. Such an orbit was probably created by collisions within the asteroid belt.

== Mass ==
Sikhote-Alin is a massive fall, with the pre-atmospheric mass of the meteoroid estimated at approximately . A more recent estimate by Tsvetkov (and others) puts the mass at around .

Krinov estimated the post-atmospheric mass of the meteoroid to be some .

== Strewn field and craters ==
The strewn field for this meteorite covered an elliptical area of about . Some of the fragments made impact craters, the largest of which was about across and deep. Fragments of the meteorite were also driven into the surrounding trees, embedding themselves.

== Composition and classification ==

The Sikhote-Alin meteorite is classified as an iron meteorite belonging to the meteorite group IIAB and with a coarse octahedrite structure. It is composed of approximately 93% iron, 5.9% nickel, 0.42% cobalt, 0.46% phosphorus, and 0.28% sulfur, with trace amounts of germanium and iridium. Minerals present include taenite, plessite, troilite, chromite, kamacite, and schreibersite.

==Specimens==
Specimens of the Sikhote-Alin Meteorite are basically of two types:
# &quot;individual&quot;, &quot;thumbprinted&quot; or &quot;regmaglypted specimens&quot;, showing fusion crust and signs of atmospheric ablation
# &quot;shrapnel&quot; or &quot;fragmented specimens&quot;, sharp-edged pieces of torn metal showing evidence of violent fragmentation
The first type probably broke off the main object early in the descent. These pieces are characterized by regmaglypts (cavities resembling thumbprints) on the surface of each specimen. The second type are fragments which were either torn apart during the atmospheric explosions or blasted apart upon impact on the frozen ground. Most resulted from the explosion at 5.6 km (3.5 mi) altitude.

A large specimen is on display in Moscow. Many other specimens are held by Russian Academy of Science and many smaller specimens exist in the collectors&#x27; market.

<text>Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems, or J-UCAS, was the name for the joint U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force unmanned combat air vehicle procurement project. Originally two separate projects of the U.S. Air Force and Navy respectively: UCAV and UCAV-N; both programs merged in 2003. The two vehicles involved in J-UCAS were the Boeing X-45 and Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus, originally part of UCAV and UCAV-N respectively. J-UCAS was managed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. In the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, it was stated that the J-UCAS program would be terminated and instead a new long-range strategic bomber program, Next-Generation Bomber, for the Air Force would launch. The program was revitalized into a Navy-only program named UCAS-D.

The goal of the J-UCAS effort was to develop a &quot;versatile combat network in which air and ground components are nodes that can be changed over time to support a wide range of potential missions.&quot;

==History==

The Air Force UCAV and Navy UCAV-N programs, both managed by DARPA, merged to form the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems, still managed by DARPA. The Boeing X-45A and Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus were selected for the program and first flew in May 2002 and February 2003 respectively.

It is unusual for DARPA to be involved with advanced development programs; the agency normally performs proof-of-concept demonstrations and then hands follow-on programs on to interested military services. Apparently this arrangement was driven from the office of the secretary of defense, the idea being that DARPA would be able to keep the development effort on track until advanced demonstrators were available, and then the program would have so much momentum that it would keep on going. The long list of US military UAV programs that have been bungled and dropped after much expense and effort, with some of them like the Hunter ending up effectively reaching operational service in spite of it, provoked the decision.

Of course, the candidates for the J-UCAS program included developments of the follow-ons to the Boeing X-45A and the Northrop Grumman X-47A Pegasus. DARPA and Boeing had been working on the &quot;X-45B&quot;, a scaled-up X-45A that was seen as the prototype for an operational machine that would reach service in 2008, and would carry a 1,590 kilogram (3,500 pound) warload to a combat radius of 1,665 kilometers (900 nautical miles). Two were to be built, but before any metal could be bent for the two X-45B prototypes planned, the Air Force redirected the effort to an even more capable machine, the &quot;X-45C&quot;.

The X-45C, as currently envisioned, will be a flying wing powered by a single F404-GE-102D turbofan engine. Current specs include:

The payload and range specifications are as defined by J-UCAS requirements. The operational radius specification is for a strike to a predefined target and back home again. A secondary range specification dictates a two-hour loiter capability at a radius of 1,850 kilometers (1,000 NMI).

In the summer of 2003, Northrop Grumman formed an alliance with Lockheed Martin as a subcontractor to help develop the &quot;X-47B&quot;, a follow-on to the X-47 that would compete against Boeing efforts. The alliance, which repeats the successful teamup that won the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter effort, is focused on building a modular stealthy UCAV that could be adapted to a wide range of missions. It would have a speed of Mach 0.8 at 10,670 meters (35,000 feet) and endurance of up to 12 hours.

The X-47B was originally planned to have its first flight by 2007 alongside the X-45C and introduction of a &quot;Common Operating System.&quot;

The goal of the J-UCAS effort is to develop a &quot;versatile combat network in which air and ground components are nodes that can be changed over time to support a wide range of potential missions.&quot;

The USAF has envisioned an operational UCAV as being stored in broken-down form inside a container that can be airlifted, with the UCAV having a specified &quot;shelf life&quot; of 20 years. It would be removed from the container every few years for inspections and could be checked with an electronic test system. The Air Force would also like to use an operational UCAV as the basis of a &quot;penetrating jammer&quot; platform that would penetrate enemy airspace to blind hostile radars. It would replace the Grumman EA-6B Prowler manned electronic warfare aircraft in this role. A reconnaissance payload is also being considered. However, the Air Force wants to focus on the strike role first.

Over the long term, the Air Force is interested in using a UCAV as a platform to carry directed-energy weapons, initially a &quot;high power microwave (HPM)&quot; weapon to fry adversary electronic systems. The HPM weapon would be &quot;fired&quot; out an aperture on the front of the aircraft, with electronic steering used to direct the beam over an arc covering about 45 degrees to either side of the UCAV. The HPM weapon could be followed by a high power laser weapon.

The Navy is interested in many of the features on the Air Force wish list, though the Navy has put reconnaissance and jamming at the top of the list and strike at the bottom, and seems to be indifferent to the containerization concept. Of course, a navalized UCAV would have a stronger airframe and landing gear for carrier takeoffs and landings; an arresting hook; and avionics for automated carrier approach and landing, along with a &quot;relative navigation system&quot; that will tell the UCAV where it is relative to the carrier.

A big concern of program officials is to ensure that widespread use of UCAVs does not increase the number of friendly fire incidents or collateral damage to civilian targets. The evaluation program will investigate this matter in detail. One of the concepts now being given considerable thought is use of a manned aircraft, such as an F-15E Strike Eagle, as a UCAV &quot;mothership&quot;, with the weapons systems officer in the back seat directing one or more UCAVs over high-speed datalink.

<text>Empire lite is a form of imperialism in which major powers shape world affairs using diplomacy and short-term military intervention rather than conquest, colonialism or direct governance of other countries. It differs from classical imperialism in two ways: it involves a much smaller commitment of resources, and it does not involve new settlement by the imperial power.

The term was first popularized by Canadian author and politician Michael Ignatieff in his book &quot;Empire Lite: Nation-Building in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan&quot;. In this and other writings, Ignatieff identifies the author of empire lite as the United States, the world&#x27;s last military superpower. The purpose of empire lite, Ignatieff believes, is to build a global &quot;humanitarian empire&quot; of free, self-governing countries through long-term nation building — including the use of military force — in failed or failing states.

Ignatieff supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 because he saw it as one such intervention, a step he later regretted.

<doc id="1104134" wikidata="Q7970699" url="?curid=1104134" title="Warrimoo, New South Wales">
<text>Warrimoo (formerly Karabar) is a medium-sized village in the lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia, 273 metres above sea level. Warrimoo is located 68 kilometres west of Sydney, in the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. Warrimoo borders the townships/suburbs of Blaxland, Mount Riverview, Sun Valley and Valley Heights. The suburb is located five train stops from Penrith and 11 train stops to Katoomba.

==Population==
The population of Warrimoo is mostly of European background. Languages apart from English spoken in Warrimoo include French, Mandarin, Greek, Spanish and Italian. 31% of residents hold bachelor&#x27;s degrees or higher and 30% are professionals. More than 35% claim to have no religious affiliation. The median weekly household income is $2,097.

==Local Services==

At the centre of Warrimoo is railway station (with bike racks) and Warrimoo Citizens Hall. There are several shops around the train station including a post office, fire station, cafe, car mechanic, antique shops, restaurant/venue hire and an old fashioned general store which is a popular tourist bus stop off point for groups heading to Katoomba and the Jenolan Caves.

The closest shopping centre is Westfield Penrith.

==Parks/Entertainment==
Parks include Ardill Park, Arthur St Park, Possum Park, Terrymont Rd Park and Cross St Nature Reserve. The Florabella Pass track is a popular hike between Warrimoo and Blaxland. Tennis Courts and Warrimoo oval are both on Rickard Rd.

Other local attractions within a 10 km radius include Glenbrook Swim Centre, Nepean River, Nepean Belle Paddlewheeler, Sydney International Regatta Centre, iFLY Downunder, Jetpack Adventures, Cables Wake Park, Glenbrook Cinema and Penrith Panthers. A further 20 minutes from Penrith is water park, Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild and Sydney Zoo. 
==Transport==
Warrimoo railway station is on the Blue Mountains Line of the NSW TrainLink intercity network. Warrimoo is also serviced by bus through Blue Mountains Transit and uber. The original 1918 Warrimoo station burnt down in a bushfire in the 1950s and was subsequently rebuilt. A decision by the NSW Liberal government to buy new South Korean made trains has resulted in controversy over Warrimoo&#x27;s train station which may need renovating to accommodate the trains that are up to 205 metres long. Added to that, the train tracks may also need adjusting. Western Sydney Airport is due to open in 2026 with a train link via Parramatta.

==Schools/childcare==
Warrimoo is served by a small public school on Florabella Rd (Warrimoo Public School) and a K-12 private school (Wycliffe Christian School).

Other nearby schools include Blue Mountains Grammar School, Springwood High, Winmalee High and Blaxland High.

==Culture==

Author and illustrator Dorothy Wall, who lived in Florabella St (1934–37), placed Warrimoo on the map with her children&#x27;s books about the mischievous koala, Blinky Bill. Polish born film maker Yoram Gross, turned the books into movies bringing the iconic character onto the world stage.

Not far away is the Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum in Faulconbridge. Norman Lindsay wrote about Bunyip Bluegum, the anthropomorphic koala star of well known children&#x27;s book, The Magic Pudding which was also turned into a movie, directed by Karl Zwicky.

Former &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; journalist and founding &#x27;House and Garden&#x27; editor Beryl Guertner, lived in Warrimoo.

There are local music and choir groups that are community run such as the Moo Choir, which meets and performs out of the Warrimoo Public School hall, and the biannual music group, the Sound Lounge.

George Finey, who was a cartoonist on the Daily Telegraph also spent time living in Warrimoo.

The poet Greg McLaren, author of the post-apocalyptic verse novel &quot;camping underground&quot;, and the collections &quot;Windfall&quot;, &quot;Australian ravens&quot; and &quot;The Kurri Kurri Book of the Dead&quot;, is a resident of Warrimoo.

==Bushwalking==
The Florabella Pass Track is a popular and scenic nature walk from Warrimoo into Blaxland and passes through abundant foliage, creeks and rare wildlife. The bush walk leads into a thick rainforest filled with Lyrebirds, Flame Robins, Sulphur-Crested Cockatoos, Gang Gang Cockatoos, Owls and other rare species. The Pippas Pass portion of the track is renowned for its colourful bushland such as flannel flowers, Waratah plants and pink angophoras and its shelter caves. The walk is less than 9 km however involves some steep hiking. There are many other bushwalking tracks, including a long walk to Glenbrook via the untracked Glenbrook Gorge. The Wilderness Society and other environmental groups encourage koala sightings to be reported due to their endangered existence.

==History==
Warrimoo is an Aboriginal word meaning eagle&#x27;s nest or &quot;place of the screaming white bird&quot;.

In 1898, a railway station platform named Karabar was built in the area to service a developing estate, possibly sharing the same name. It had closed before World War I, but in 1918 a new station was built, not much further down the Blue Mountains line, named Warrimoo. Entrepreneur and developer, Arthur Rickard was behind the development of Warrimoo. His plan was to subdivide blocks so there were a mixture of small blocks and larger blocks which he established to promote sustainable living. On what was known as the Warrimoo Estate, Rickard encouraged residents to develop orchards, vegetable gardens and raise chickens. Warrimoo retains many historical homes and buildings throughout the village including a distillery (where the local public school now sits) and a former &#x27;Bordillo&#x27;. Charity worker and gospeller George Ardill, moved to Warrimoo in his latter years. He lived at 13 Florabella Street. During his years there, Ardill built numerous homes along Florabella st and The Avenue which he set up for homeless women and children. Ardill was also a key instigator in the removal of generations of Indigenous children from their families across Australia via his role in the New South Wales Aborigines Protection Board.

Dorothy Wall, author of the children&#x27;s book &quot;Blinky Bill&quot;, lived in Warrimoo from 1934 to 1937 whilst publishing the second book of the series. In 2015, a mural was painted at Possum Park in honour of the illustrator.

<doc id="1104135" wikidata="Q5682076" url="?curid=1104135" title="The Sean Hannity Show">
<text>The Sean Hannity Show is a conservative talk radio show hosted by Sean Hannity. The program is broadcast live every weekday, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. ET. The show is produced in the New York City studios of radio station WOR and is transmitted via ISDN from Hannity&#x27;s home in Florida, or on location if Hannity&#x27;s commitments to Fox News Channel take him out of the New York area. The show is now syndicated by Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia, on terrestrial radio affiliates across the United States, on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125. and on American Forces Network&#x27;s AFN 360 PowerTalk and The Voice channels. The primary focus of the program is the politics of the day, with interviews of liberal and conservative commentators. After conservative radio show &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; ended its run following Limbaugh&#x27;s 2021 death, &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; became the most-listened-to commercial radio talk show with an estimated 16.25 million listeners.

==Syndication==

Syndication began through the ABC Radio Networks on September 10, 2001, one day before the September 11 attacks. The program is carried on WSB in Atlanta, Georgia (second and third hours delayed three hours), KFYI in Phoenix, Arizona, WOKV in Jacksonville, Florida, WDTK in Detroit, WCBM in Baltimore, Maryland and WKRC in Cincinnati, Ohio, among others. The show is carried in most markets by a Citadel Broadcasting radio station; the show is owned by Citadel Broadcasting, which acquired the ABC Radio networks in 2006. 

Hannity&#x27;s first version of his radio show was in the late 1980s as a volunteer broadcaster for the University of California, Santa Barbara&#x27;s radio station, KCSB-FM. He was dismissed from the station in 1989, following a controversial interview about AIDS in which he insulted a lesbian caller. Later, Hannity would bring his program to WVNN in Athens, Alabama and NewsRadio WGST in Atlanta, Georgia.

Hannity is the highest rated talk program on many stations. The show is carried on 530 stations. He is a three-time consecutive winner of Radio &amp; Records National Talk Show Host of The Year Award from 2003-2005. In 2004, Hannity signed a US$25 million, five-year contract extension with ABC Radio to continue the show through 2009; however, ABC Radio&#x27;s acquisition by Citadel Broadcasting on June 12, 2007 gave Hannity an opportunity to leave one year after the acquisition. 

In July 2008, it was announced that Hannity&#x27;s show would be co-managed by Citadel&#x27;s ABC Radio Networks and Premiere Radio Networks, a division of Clear Channel Communications. Premiere Radio would handle advertising sales and distribution to all non-Citadel owned stations, including Clear Channel-owned stations. Hannity already had agreements with approximately 80 Clear Channel stations in a separate agreement. The two networks would cooperate for special circumstances.

==Radio show==
The show primarily features a mixture of monologues, conversations with callers, and interviews with those in the news.

===Content===
Hannity&#x27;s frequent political targets include terrorism, illegal immigration, weapon of mass destruction in Iraq,
and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. He frequently characterizes American liberalism as a movement more in line with democratic socialism than classical liberalism.

The show frequently features &quot;man on the street&quot; interviews (Man On The Street Thursday), where New York pedestrians are stopped and questioned about politics. Hannity will sometimes debate the answers with participants.

The show also features the occasional inclusion of behind the scenes staff, including producers Elisha, Lynda, &quot;Sweet Baby&quot; James, and animal-rights proponent &quot;Flipper&quot;. &quot;Gregster&quot; is the engineer who typically plays the audio clips.

The show used to close daily with the segment &quot;Trash the Lines&quot; where calls were taken unscreened, with callers given approximately five seconds to say whatever they wanted. The segment, which had its roots in a late-night show Hannity hosted earlier in his career, has been used less frequently since the summer of 2006.

Following the election victory of Democrat Barack Obama, Hannity has hyperbolically referred to his show as &quot;conservatism in exile&quot;, &quot;the conservative resistance,&quot; &quot;the conservative underground.&quot;

===The &quot;Hate-Hannity Hotline&quot;===
Hannity provides a phone line for people who disagree with him to call in. He plays some of these clips at the beginning of the bottom half-hour segment of the show. He usually supplements these clips with the explanation that he is performing a service to the American people by &quot;Absorbing the hate and bitterness of the angry left so that they will be nicer to you when you meet them along your way.&quot; This has appeared with less frequency in the radio show, though on the revamped &quot;Hannity&quot; on the Fox News Channel, this has become a regular segment (usually airing on Thursday).

===Guest hosts===
WABC personality Mark Levin frequently filled in for Hannity during the host&#x27;s absence until Levin obtained his own syndicated program. Guest hosts have included Barry Farber, Mike Gallagher, Curtis Sliwa, Kirby Wilbur, Dennis Miller, and Mark Simone.

===Guests on his show===
The frequent guests on his radio show included John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Bobby Jindal, Fred Thompson and other politicians from both sides of the political aisle.

===Book club===
The &quot;Hannity&quot; show also has a book club with author interviews and discussions on topics. More recent books have included &quot;Strategery&quot; by Bill Sammon and &quot;Fight Back&quot; by G. Gordon Liddy. Hannity has also authored three &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers on politics and current events.

===Show website===
Hannity&#x27;s website offers subscribers to the &quot;Hannity Insider&quot; subscription service live and recorded streaming audio of the program, available for download to an iPod or other MP3 player. In addition, the program was added to the Armed Forces Radio Network in December 2005. Audio streams of &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; average more than 190,000 subscribed listeners per month. There is also &quot;Hannidate&quot;, a chat room for conservative singles, both heterosexual and gay. The website also includes a forum to discuss political topics. Respectful conversation and debate is encouraged.

<text>Bohr is a lunar impact crater that is located near the western lunar limb, in the area that is affected by librations. It is attached to the southwestern rim of the larger, eroded Vasco da Gama formation, and to the southeast of the crater Einstein. The crater was observed for the first time in 1963, by Arthus and Ewen Whitaker in the book &quot;Rectified Lunar Atlas.&quot;

The rim of Bohr is worn and eroded, and a pair of small, bowl-shaped craters lies across the western rim. The rim to the northeast has been shored up by the adjacent Vasco da Gama, but the remainder forms an irregular ring of rugged ground. To the southwest of Bohr is Vallis Bohr, a valley trending in a north–south direction. This long cleft is most likely associated with the formation of the Mare Orientale farther to the south.

<text>Boole is a lunar impact crater that lies along the northwestern limb of the Moon, to the northwest of the crater Gerard. At this location it is viewed nearly from the side, and is very oblong in shape due to foreshortening. The crater formation is nearly circular, however, with a wide inner wall that has been worn and rounded due to subsequent impacts. It is named after George Boole.

To the north of Boole is the crater Cremona, and to the southwest are Paneth and Smoluchowski. The eroded and somewhat distorted satellite crater Boole E is attached to the southern rim, forming a saddle-shaped valley between the two formations. The interior floor of Boole is relatively flat, and marked only by tiny craterlets. There is a small craterlet on the floor next to the southwest rim, and a tiny crater along the western inner wall.

The surface along the western face of Boole is pock-marked by a multitude of small craterlets that run in a northerly direction towards Brianchon. A sequence of these impacts forms a short &quot;catena&quot;, or crater chain, near the western rim of Boole.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Boole.

<doc id="1104185" wikidata="Q6443521" url="?curid=1104185" title="Kumara Vyasa">
<text>Narayanappa, known by his pen name Kumara Vyasa, was an influential and classical poet of early 15th century in the Kannada language. His pen name is a tribute to his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, a rendering of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; in Kannada. &quot;Kumara Vyasa&quot; literally means &quot;Little Vyasa&quot; or &quot;Son of Vyasa&quot; (Vyasa is the title of Krishna Dwaipayana, the author of Mahabharata). He was the contemporary and archrival of the famous Veerashaiva poet laureate Chamarasa who wrote the seminal work &quot;Prabhulingaleele&quot; covering the lives of Allama Prabhu and other Shiva Sharanas, circa 1435. Both poets worked in the court of Deva Raya II.

==Works==

Kumara Vyasa&#x27;s most famous work, the &quot;Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari&quot; (the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; of Karnataka) is popularly known as &quot;Gadugina Bharata&quot; and &quot;Kumaravyasa Bharata&quot;. It is an adaptation of the first ten &quot;parvas&quot; (chapters) of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. A devotee of Krishna, Kumara Vyasa ends his epic with the coronation of Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandavas. The work is celebrated in Kannada literature due to its universal appeal.

&quot;Gadugina Bharata&quot; is composed in the &quot;Bhamini Shatpadi&quot; metre, a form of six lined stanzas. &quot;Kumara Vyasa&quot; explores a wide range of human emotions, examines values, and displays extensive mastery over vocabulary. The work is particularly known for its use of sophisticated metaphors. &quot;Kumara Vyasa&quot; is also renowned for his characterization. &quot;Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari&quot; is also known as &quot;Dasha Parva Bharata&quot; because it originally had only ten parvas as opposed to the eighteen in the original &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

Kumara&#x27;s &quot;Kathamanjari&quot; covers only up to the Gadayuddha, the battle between Duryodhana and Bheema, and the killing of Duryodhana. The subsequent parts of the original &quot;Mahabharata&quot; like the &quot;Yudhishthira Pattabhishekha&quot;, &quot;Ashwa Medha Yaaga&quot;, and the &quot;Swargaarohana Parva&quot; are not included.

It may be noted that Lakshmeesha, another great poet who was born a few decades after Kumara&#x27;s death, took up and completed &quot;Ashwa Medha Yaaga parva&quot; alone in his work &quot;Jaimini Bharata&quot; in Kannada. This spiritual work was considered equal to &quot;Kathamanjari&quot; for its narration.

There is a strong belief among locals that Kumara was a blessed poet of Sri Veera Narayana, another name for Lord Vishnu. The poet sat in front of the &quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot; in the temple and Narayana himself narrated the story of the ancient &quot;Mahabharatha&quot; from behind the statue. The poet transformed the story excellent poetry. However, Narayana laid down a condition that Kumara was to only listen to this voice without attempting to see the source or the spirit narrating the story. When the tenth parva of his work was complete, Kumara was deeply curious to see the narrator. Much to his surprise, he saw Narayana himself narrating the story. He also saw a scene of the Kurukshetra War as if it were happening in front of him. However, Kumara had violated the condition that he not search for the source of the voice. At that point, the lord disappeared and the narration of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; stopped forever.

Kumara has shown an exemplary writing style in the introduction. He proudly claims that his poetry is matchless and that it caters to the taste of all kinds of readers. He writes that in his poetry &quot;A king enjoys the valor, A brahmin the essence of all vedas, philosopher the ultimate philosophy, ministers and state administrators the tact of rule and Lovers the romantic notes.&quot; In addition, he proudly acclaims that this work of his is the &quot;Master of the works of all other great scholars.&quot; However, his selflessness may be noted when he says he merely noted all that was narrated by his lord, the actual poet.

Kumara Vyasa&#x27;s other, lesser-known work is &quot;Airavata.&quot;

===Place and time===

His magnum opus, &quot;Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari&quot;, was completed in 1430 when Deva Raya II was ruling the Vijayanagara empire. Kumara Vyasa earned high esteem as a poet in his court. Kumara Vyasa was mentioned by other prominent 15th century poets, such as Kanaka Dasa and Timmanna Kavi.

Kumara Vyasa lived in Koliwad, a village from Gadag in North Karnataka. According to popular legend, Kumara Vyasa is said to have composed his work at the Veeranarayana temple in Gadag. A pillar known as Kumara Vyasa&#x27;s pillar stands in the temple to this day.

==Influence on Kannada literature==
Kumara Vyasa&#x27;s works belong to the Nadugannada (Middle-age Kannada) period of Kannada literature. His influence on later Kannada literature is significant. Gadugina Bharata is still widely read. It is popularly sung in a unique style known as Gamaka.

<text>Büsching is a lunar impact crater that is located in the crater-covered southern highlands of the Moon. It was named after German geographer Anton F. Büsching. The similar-sized crater Buch is located adjacent to its southwestern rim, and further to the southwest lies Maurolycus.
This crater has been eroded by a long history of subsequent impacts, so that the rim has been worn down and the edge rounded. Several small craterlets lie along the edge of the rim, and there is a tiny crater on the interior floor near the east-southeastern rim. The interior floor is somewhat irregular and lacks a central peak at the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Büsching.

<text>Alec Su You-peng (Chinese: 蘇有朋; born 11 September 1973) is a Taiwanese actor and singer.

Su became a teen idol in the 1980s as a member of the boyband Little Tigers. After the megahit TV series &quot;My Fair Princess&quot; (1998–1999)&quot;,&quot; he has had a successful career in acting, starring in dramas such as &quot;The Legendary Siblings&quot; (1999), &quot;Romance in the Rain&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber&quot; (2003). Su has won awards from Hundred Flowers Awards and Macau International Movie Festival for the films &quot;The Message&quot; (2009) and &quot;A Tibetan Love Song&quot; (2010), respectively. He also produced the TV series &quot;Destiny by Love&quot; (2013) and directed the film &quot;The Left Ear&quot; (2015).

==Career==

===Musical: Xiao Hu Dui (Little Tigers)===

Alec Su&#x27;s career started in 1988, at the age of 15, when he joined Little Tigers. The band was the first idol singing group that debuted in the Taiwanese music industry and Alec was labelled as the &quot;cute tiger.&quot; The group&#x27;s popularity was unprecedented; the Little Tigers attracted fans from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and amongst Chinese communities around the world. The success of the band began the new generation of Taiwanese pop culture in the early 1990s. In 2010, the Little Tigers were invited to participate in the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, in which they sang a medley of three of their biggest hits and won accolades as the &quot;favorite singing group&quot; for the event.

Apart from being a popular singer, during this period Su was epitomized by the general public as a superior student. He attended Taiwan&#x27;s number one high school, Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School and was accepted into the prestigious National Taiwan University, where he majored in Mechanical Engineering. Su&#x27;s experiences describing his high school years, preparing for the Taiwan university entrance examinations while trying to also juggle his performing schedule as a member of a wildly popular singing group, are recorded in his 1995 book entitled My Days at Jian Zhong / Youth Never Die.

However, as Su became so well known at such a young age, he felt that he had lost his freedom as a result of being in the limelight. At the age of 21, a year before his university graduation in Taiwan, Su decided to leave school and study abroad in England.

===Television===

In 1995, after the breakup of Little Tigers, Su embarked on an acting career. His role as the Wu Ah Ge, Yongqi in the Chinese TV series blockbuster &quot;My Fair Princess&quot; I and II won him fame as a television actor in 1997. He continued in 2000 with another hit TV series &quot;Romance in the Rain&quot;. His later TV series include &quot;Heavenly Sword and Dragon Sabre&quot; (2002), &quot;Magic Touch of Fate&quot; (2004, costarring Taiwanese actress Ruby Lin and Korean singer Kang Ta), and &quot;Mischievous Princess&quot; (2005). He collaborated with Korean actress Chae Rim in two 2003 productions, &quot;Love of the Aegean Sea&quot; and &quot;Warriors of the Yang Clan&quot;.

In 2006, Su appeared in the 1930s drama Jiang Ji Jiu Ji co-starring with Li Qian, Cecilia Ye Tong, and Paul Chun, and which aired in Spring 2007. In 2008 he acted in the TV drama Re Ai, which aired in the spring of 2009.

In 2013-2014, Su was one of the judges on the fifth season of &quot;China&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; alongside Liu Ye, Wang Wei-Chung, and former co-star Zhao Wei.

===Film===

In recent years, Su has been concentrating on his film career. Since the second half of 2008 he has participated in more than a half-dozen film projects. Su also appears in the ensemble piece, &quot;Fit Lover&quot;, which had a November 2008 release, as well as guest starring in a short Taiwan film, L-O-V-E, had a wide release in Asia in autumn 2009, has been included in several international film festivals, and received several nominations (and one win, for Li Bing Bing as &quot;Best Actress&quot;) for the 2009 Golden Horse awards. A Singing Fairy,&quot; shot in Guangxi Province, and a biography of Macau composer Xian Xinghai, titled The Star and the Sea, both opened in limited release in December 2009. The Four Cupids, a romantic comedy, premiered in April 2010. Film projects for 2010 included &quot;A Tibetan Love Song&quot; (romantic drama filmed in Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) and &quot;Lost in Panic Room&quot;, a &quot;locked room&quot; detective thriller. Both premiered in the fall of 2010. A sequel to the detective film, titled &quot;Lost in Panic Cruise&quot;, was released for Halloween 2011. Su continues his film career with several completed movies scheduled for release in 2012, and another currently in production.

In October 2010, Alec won the &quot;Hundred Flowers Award&quot; for &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; for his role in &quot;The Message&quot;. In December 2010, he won the &quot;Best Actor&quot; award at the 2nd Macau International Movie Festival, for his performance in &quot;A Tibetan Love Song&quot;

Along with his TV and film success, Su has released thirty top-selling albums, starting as a member of The Little Tigers group. As a solo artist he has released 14 albums, beginning in 1992 to his 2004 release &quot;Before and After&quot;. In January 2012 Su performed, along with singers Daniel Chan, Aska Yang, and Will Pan, in the 2012 Fantasy Stars Chinese New Year Concert, MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas.

In April 2017, Su announced a business partnership in the Beijing film industry with Vicki Zhao.

<text>Chamberlin is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just past the southeastern limb. It lies to the southeast of the crater Jeans, and Moulton is attached to the southeastern rim of Chamberlin. This crater is located in a part of the lunar surface that has undergone resurfacing of crater interiors, producing dark-hued crater floors.

The outer rim of this formation is somewhat irregular in shape, with outward bulges to the east and southeast. The southern rim has partly disintegrated, and merges with the northwest rim of Moulton. The interior floor of Chamberlin has been flooded by basaltic lava, producing a nearly flat surface with a lower albedo than the typical lunar surface. The interior is otherwise devoid of features of interest, and is marked only by a few tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Chamberlin.

==Mission and Policies==

The ADA&#x27;s mission of increasing participation, maintaining a balance between education and competition, and ensuring an equitable and fair activity for all programs, regardless of their size or experience is facilitated by the ADA&#x27;s rules and is premised on the following assumptions:

1. Debate is a controlled discussion which analyzes the substantive issues raised by a particular policy proposition.

2. Debate is a persuasive, oral communication activity in which debaters assume the obligation to communicate reasons for positions taken in a manner that is coherent, intelligible, and consistent with the limitations on human speech and listening.

3. Debate tournaments will be run efficiently, honestly, and in a manner which promotes the educational values of debating for all participants.

4. Coaches and judges are educators whose job it is to effectively prepare students to debate, to objectively and fairy evaluate rounds of competition to which they are assigned, and to behave in an ethical and professional fashion.

5. Debate is an educational activity to be engaged in by undergraduates who are officially enrolled full-time students in good academic standing at the colleges and universities they represent in competition.

<doc id="1104201" wikidata="Q4560543" url="?curid=1104201" title="1918 World Series">
<text>The 1918 [[World Series]] was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1918 season. The 15th edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Boston Red Sox against the National League champion Chicago Cubs. The Red Sox beat the Cubs four games to two. The Series victory for the Red Sox was their fifth in five tries, going back to . The Red Sox scored only nine runs in the entire Series, the fewest runs by the winning team in World Series history. Along with the , and 1907 World Series (the latter two of which the Cubs also played in), the 1918 World Series is one of only four Fall Classics where neither team hit a home run.

The 1918 Series was played under several metaphorical dark clouds. The Series was held early in September because of the World War I &quot;Work or Fight&quot; order that forced the premature end of the regular season on September 2, and remains the only World Series to be played entirely in September. The Series was marred by players threatening to strike due to low gate receipts.

The Chicago home games in the series were played at Comiskey Park, which had a greater seating capacity than Weeghman Park, the prior home of the Federal League Chicago Whales that the Cubs were then using and which would be rechristened Wrigley Field in 1925. The Red Sox had played their home games in the and 1916 World Series in the more expansive Braves Field, but they returned to Fenway Park for the 1918 series.

During the seventh-inning stretch of Game 1, the band began playing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; because the country was involved in World War I. The song would be named the national anthem of the United States in 1931, and during World War II its playing would become a regular pre-game feature of baseball games and other sporting events. The winning pitcher of Game 1 was Babe Ruth, who pitched a shutout.

Although the Red Sox had just won their record-setting fifth World Series title, the 1918 championship would be the last Red Sox win until . The drought of 86 years was often attributed to the Curse of the Bambino. The alleged curse came to be when Red Sox owner Harry Frazee traded the superbly talented but troublesome Babe Ruth (who was instrumental in their 1918 victory) to the New York Yankees for cash after the 1919 season.

The Cubs would not win their next World Series until 2016. The Cubs, who last won in , won the National League but lost the Series in 1910, 1918, , , , , and , allegedly stymied by the infamous Curse of the Billy Goat imposed during that latter Series. The Red Sox, who had won the American League but lost the Series in , , , and , finally won the World Series in and then won again in , 2013 and 2018. When the Red Sox won in 2018 (against the Los Angeles Dodgers), they became the first team to win the Fall Classic exactly one century apart.

After Game 6, it would be some 87 years until the Cubs and Red Sox would play again. A three-game interleague match-up at Wrigley Field began June 10, 2005, and was Boston&#x27;s first visit to the park. The Cubs would not return to Fenway Park for nearly 94 years until a three-game interleague match-up beginning May 20, 2011.

To date, Red Sox manager Ed Barrow is the only manager to win a World Series without previously playing in organized baseball, whether in the minors or majors.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
Game 1 went to the Red Sox, 1–0, with Babe Ruth pitching the shutout before 19,274 fans. Stuffy McInnis knocked in the game&#x27;s only run, driving in Dave Shean with a fourth-inning single off Hippo Vaughn. During the seventh-inning stretch, the U.S. Navy band began to play &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, Red Sox infielder Fred Thomas—who was in the Navy and had been granted furlough to play in the World Series—immediately turned toward the American flag and gave it a military salute, according to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Other players turned to the flag with hands over hearts, and the already-standing crowd began to sing. At the song&#x27;s conclusion, the previously quiet fans erupted in thunderous applause. At the time, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that it &quot;marked the highest point of the day&#x27;s enthusiasm.&quot; The song would be played at each of the Series&#x27; remaining games, to increasingly rapturous response. Other baseball parks began to play the song on holidays and special occasions, and Red Sox owner Harry Frazee made it a regular part of Boston home games. &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; officially became the U.S. national anthem in 1931, and by the end of World War II, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden ordered that it be played at every football game. The tradition quickly spread to other sports, aided by the introduction of large sound systems and post-war patriotism.

===Game 2===
The Cubs rebounded to tie the Series with a 3–1 victory in Game 2 the next day, behind Lefty Tyler&#x27;s six-hit pitching. Tyler himself hit a two-run single in the second inning to make it 3–0 and carried a shutout into the ninth inning, when the Red Sox scored their only run.

===Game 3===
The series remained in Chicago for Game 3 due to wartime restrictions on travel. The Red Sox won 2–1 to take a 2–1 series lead as Carl Mays scattered seven hits. Wally Schang and Everett Scott&#x27;s back-to-back RBI singles in the fourth inning were all Boston needed for the win. Vaughn lost his second game of the Series, which ended when Cub baserunner Charlie Pick was caught in a rundown between third and home while trying to score on a passed ball.

===Game 4===

Sunday the 8th was a travel day. The teams didn&#x27;t arrive in Boston until the next day, shortly before the start of Game 4 that same day. The Cubs tied it in the eighth, ending Ruth&#x27;s World Series scoreless inning streak on hits by Charlie Hollocher and Les Mann; but the Red Sox won it in the home half of the inning on a passed ball by Killefer and a wild throw by relief pitcher Phil Douglas, scoring Schang for a 3–2 victory and a 3–1 series lead.

Starting pitcher Babe Ruth batted sixth for the Red Sox in Game 4. He remained the last starting pitcher in World Series history to bat other than ninth in the batting order until Zack Greinke batted eighth for the Houston Astros in Game 4 of the 2021 World Series.

===Game 5===
Vaughn finally earned a Series victory in Game 5 with a five-hit shutout, as the Cubs rallied back for a 3–0 victory. Dode Paskert&#x27;s two-run double in the top of the eighth sealed the deal for the Chicagoans after Mann had knocked in the first run in the top of the third.

===Game 6===
Attendance for Game 6 at Fenway on Wednesday, September 11, was down from over 24,000 on Tuesday to a mere 15,238, but the Red Sox went home happy. Max Flack&#x27;s third-inning error allowed two Sox runs to score, which were all they needed for a 2–1 victory and the World&#x27;s Championship of 1918 behind Carl Mays&#x27; second win of the Series, a complete game three-hitter.

This was the last Red Sox World Series win for 86 years, and the last time they won the deciding game at home until .

The Red Sox won the series despite a team batting average of .186, lowest for a winning club in World Series history.

==Allegations of a Series fix and game tampering==
As with the 1917 World Series, there were concerns about whether the 1918 World Series was being played honestly, a rumor revived in 2005 and explored further in the 2009 book &quot;The Original Curse&quot; by Sean Deveney (McGraw-Hill). Some of the Cubs were later suspected of being &quot;crooked&quot;. Pitcher Phil Douglas, accused of conspiring to fix a regular-season game in 1922, was suspended for life. Pitcher Claude Hendrix, who didn&#x27;t play much in the 1918 Series, was suspected of fixing a game in 1920 but retired after that season and was never officially suspended.

There was no solid evidence that the 1918 World Series itself was &quot;fixed&quot;, and with the war dominating the news nothing came of the rumors. It was another season before baseball&#x27;s relationship with gambling erupted in a major scandal. Star pitcher &quot;Ol&#x27; Pete&quot; Alexander of the Cubs saw almost no action in the 1918 regular season due to military service and none in the Series. This left the Cubs pitching corps thin compared to the strong Red Sox staff, which included Babe Ruth and Carl Mays. Hippo Vaughn was the strongest Cubs pitcher, having won the pitching triple crown in 1918, but had the misfortune of starting against the best arms the Red Sox had and taking two of the four Cub losses.

In 2011, a document discovered by the Chicago History Museum cited the court testimony of Chisox pitcher Eddie Cicotte during the investigation of the 1919 Black Sox Scandal a year after the 1918 World Series. According to the trial transcript, Cicotte made vague references and allegations that the Cubs had purposely lost the 1918 World Series to the Red Sox, and justified their &quot;fixing&quot; the games they had lost (all four by one run) by alleging that the owners of both teams had short-changed their players with insufficient shares of the gate receipts.

<text>Compton is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located in the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the east of the Mare Humboldtianum, and southwest of the walled plain Schwarzschild. To the southeast of Compton is the heavily eroded crater Swann.

This formation is roughly circular, with a wide, irregular outer rim that varies considerably in width. Parts of the inner wall have d steps that form wide shelves along the edge. Within the wall is a floor that has been resurfaced by lava flows some time in the past. This surface has a lower albedo than the surroundings, giving it a slightly darker hue.

At the midpoint of the floor is a formation of mounts that comprise the central peak. This peak is surrounded by a semi-circular ring of hills that lie in the western half of the crater at a radius about half that of the inner edge of the rim. These mounts form jagged rises through the lava-covered surface and lie at irregular intervals from each other.

The interior also contains a set of slender rilles within the ring of hills, primarily in the northwest part of the crater floor. Apart from a small, bowl-shaped crater near the eastern rim, the floor only contains a few tiny craters.

Compton is one of the largest craters of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Compton.

<doc id="1104220" wikidata="Q7390306" url="?curid=1104220" title="SIEV X">
<text>SIEV X was the name assigned by Australian authorities to an Indonesian fishing boat carrying over 400 asylum seekers en route to Australia, which capsized in international waters with great loss of life on 19 October 2001. SIEV stands for Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel and is the acronym used by the surveillance authority for any boat that has entered Australian waters without prior authorisation. The X is a designation used where a tracking number has not yet been assigned, in accordance with Australian Government orders.

The dilapidated Indonesian fishing boat was en route from Sumatra to Christmas Island carrying over 400 asylum seekers. It sank just south of the Indonesian island of Java, killing 353 people, mainly women and children. The tragedy was politically controversial in Australia, as it occurred during an election campaign at a time when asylum seekers and border protection were major issues.

==Background==
The SIEV-X incident occurred during the 2001 Australian Federal election campaign. The Tampa affair had focused national media&#x27;s attention on the issue of asylum seekers. Prime Minister John Howard said his policy would prevent people smuggling and stop the boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Australia. The Howard government had issued instructions to the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to prevent any refugees from reaching Australia via boat. The AFP set about a campaign of disrupting organised people smugglers who operated with overcrowded and dangerous boats. The Royal Australian Navy began intercepting boats that entered Australian waters and transferring all people to Christmas Island.

==Sinking==
On 18 October 2001, a small, unnamed 19.5 metre by 4 metre Indonesian fishing boat departed Bandar Lampung, Indonesia, with 421 passengers on board. On the 19th, the boat sank during a storm in Indonesian waters about 70 km south of Java. The area was legally in international waters but within both Indonesia&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and Indonesia&#x27;s internationally designated zone of search and rescue responsibility. It also fell inside a temporary Australian border protection surveillance area around the Australian external territory of Christmas Island (which is some 1700 km from mainland Australia). This latter designation was an internal planning and operational tool used by the Australian authorities to deter people smuggling. It had no legal validity and conferred no responsibility in international law.

Approximately 146 children, 142 women and 65 men died. On 20 October, 44 survivors were rescued by an Indonesian fishing boat, the Indah Jaya Makmur. A 45th survivor was rescued about twelve hours later by another boat, the Surya Terang.

The International Organization for Migration stated that it had expected such an event to occur due to &quot;the way the people smugglers pack these boats&quot;.

==Senate Select Committee==
On 20 February 2002, the Australian Senate Select Committee inquiring into &#x27;A Certain Maritime Incident&#x27; met for the first time. Its primary task was to investigate the children overboard affair, however its terms of reference also included investigating &quot;operational procedures observed by the Royal Australian Navy and by relevant Commonwealth agencies to ensure the safety of asylum seekers on vessels entering or attempting to enter Australian waters&quot;.

The committee investigated the SIEV-X sinking, and concluded that &quot;... it [is] extraordinary that a major human disaster could occur in the vicinity of a theatre of intensive Australian operations and remain undetected until three days after the event, without any concern being raised within intelligence and decision making circles.&quot; While no government department was found to be to blame for the tragedy, the committee was surprised that there had been no internal investigations into any systemic problems which could have allowed the Australian government to prevent it from occurring.&quot;

==SIEV X Memorials==

=== Canberra ===
Since 2003, Steve Biddulph worked with the Uniting Church in Australia to build a suitable memorial for victims and survivors of the SIEV X sinking. On Sunday, 15 September 2006, a &#x27;temporary&#x27; memorial was erected at Weston Park in Canberra. The memorial, designed by Mitchell Donaldson of Queensland&#x27;s Hillbrook Anglican School, consisted of 353 white poles, all decorated by schools, churches and community groups across Australia. While the ACT Government was supportive of the memorial, with Chief Minister Jon Stanhope opening the memorial, the then Howard government tried to stop the memorial being constructed. The National Capital Authority claimed that it was not an approved structure.

The permanent memorial, involving over a thousand student and community artists, was dedicated in October 2007.

=== Melbourne ===
A memorial of three pole of different heights - representing all the children, women, and men who died - stands at Manningham Uniting Church in Templestowe.

=== Christmas Island ===
A memorial to the disaster is in the precinct of the Administrator&#x27;s House on Christmas Island.

<text>D&#x27;Arrest is a lunar impact crater that is located in the lava-flooded region to the west of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It is named after the German astronomer Heinrich Louis d&#x27;Arrest. It lies to the southeast of the crater Agrippa and northwest of Delambre. Just to the northeast are the small, bowl-shaped craters De Morgan and Cayley.

The outer rim of D&#x27;Arrest is broken in several places, with a gash at the south end and a wide gap to the northeast where only a low ridge remains in place of the original wall. The interior has been resurfaced by lava, leaving a nearly flat, featureless floor. The surviving rim is low and worn, with ridges connecting it to the south and southwest.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to D&#x27;Arrest.

<text>Fechner is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon&#x27;s southern hemisphere, attached to the western rim of the large walled plain Planck. The eastern rim of Fechner intersects the Vallis Planck, a long, wide cleft in the surface that follows a course to the north-northwest. This valley intrudes into the southeastern rim of the crater, then continues northwards from the periphery of the northeast rim.

Attached to the western rim of Fechner is Fechner T, a small, bowl-shaped crater with a relatively high albedo ray system. This satellite crater is surrounded by a blanket of light-hued ejecta that spills across the southwestern half of Fechner&#x27;s interior floor. The crater rim of Fechner is relatively worn and eroded, with the eastern half of the rim reshaped due to the valley and proximity to Planck. The interior floor is marked by several small craters.

The crater is named after Gustav Theodor Fechner, a German physicist, psychologist, and philosopher (1801-1887). The name was approved by the IAU in 1970.

<doc id="1104238" wikidata="Q7993683" url="?curid=1104238" title="Whip-Smart">
<text>Whip-Smart is the second album by American singer-songwriter Liz Phair, released in 1994, the follow-up to Phair&#x27;s critically well received debut, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;. Despite not being as critically well received as her previous record, &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; debuted at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and ultimately achieved gold status. As of July 2010, it had sold 412,000 copies.

At the time of its release &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics, figuring inside end of year lists, including those by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;Q Magazine&quot;. The album was ranked sixth for its year inside The &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz and Jop Poll. Although obscured by its famous predecessor, the album has gained more recognition with time and is largely considered a key record to Phair&#x27;s legacy as an artist, along with her other two Matador Records releases and the Girly Sound tapes. In 2003, the German version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed the record at 95 on its list of greatest records since Autumn of 1994. In 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; the 18th greatest album of its year – considered by the magazine the peak of mainstream alternative rock.

Phair was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on the week &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; was released, and by 1994 and 1995, she made a frequent number of television appearances, including the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;.

In 1995, &quot;Supernova&quot; was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in the 37th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Background==
After the success of &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;, expectations ran high for Liz Phair&#x27;s sophomore release. Phair&#x27;s debut album had sold over 200,000 units by the spring of 1994 and was Matador&#x27;s most successful release so far. The success of &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; prompted many major labels to seek a distribution deal with Matador, most saliently Atlantic Records, which would form Phair&#x27;s next album deal.

As a result, &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; was one of the most anticipated albums of the year. Danny Goldberg, then-president of Atlantic Records, predicted that the record would &quot;hit gold quickly&quot;, and both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot; were interested in featuring Phair on their covers.

==Recording==
Phair described &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; as particularly difficult to make because at the time she didn&#x27;t have many songs that weren&#x27;t about the music industry, which displeased her manager. In fact, a substantial number of tracks on the final album (namely, &quot;Chopsticks,&quot; &quot;Shane,&quot; &quot;Go West,&quot; &quot;Whip-Smart,&quot; and parts of &quot;Jealousy&quot;, previously known as &quot;Thrax&quot;) were songs already written in 1991, when Phair recorded under the Girly-Sound moniker.

In total, &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; took about one month to record. The album was recorded in two distinct sessions: the first in August 1993 in Chicago, and the second in February 1994 in the Bahamas.

Guitarist Casey Rice described the initial sessions at Idful Studios in Chicago as subject to many distractions, such as &quot;the phone ringing, people dropping by the studio, and so on&quot;. Phair wanted to move recording to New York City, but due to financial constraints, the band ended up continuing with Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas instead.

The same team that worked on &quot;Guyville&quot; worked again on what would become &quot;Whip-Smart&quot;. The album was recorded and mixed by Brad Wood, with the assistance of Casey Rice. Wood characterized the recording process as very much spontaneous, saying that &quot;[Liz would] bring in a song and we&#x27;d record the whole thing that day. I&#x27;d have to write a drum and bass part right on the spot.&quot; There was, however, pressure to improve on the sound of the previous record, to meet the expectations of Phair&#x27;s newly formed fanbase.

Liz Phair has described &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; as a chronicle of the beginning, middle and end of a relationship: &quot;a rock fairy tale, from meeting the guy, falling for him, getting him and not getting him, going through the disillusionment period, saying &#x27;Fuck it,&#x27; and leaving, coming back to it.&quot; Phair also described the sound of the album as more confident and playful – and less frustrated, tense, and sexual – than &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;.

Phair is credited, along with Matador Records&#x27; in-house art designer Mark Ohe, with the album&#x27;s art and layout. The cover image incorporates a Soviet propaganda poster. The inner liner notes feature a series of Polaroid photographs taken by Phair herself.

==Reception==
Critical reception was generally favorable. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic states that &quot;if there are flaws in this generally first-rate follow-up, they mostly arise in comparison with &quot;Guyville&quot;, a record of such unexpected impact that most anything Phair could have done may have been found lacking&quot; and that &quot;there&#x27;s no question that Phair is a major songwriter and artist, but this album is more a solidification of her talents than a breakthrough statement.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; praised the album, stating &quot;leave it to the phenomenal Phair to pull off the seemingly impossible. Her keenly awaited follow-up to last year&#x27;s college crowd essential &quot;Exile In Guyville&quot; packs all of that album&#x27;s rough-hewn charms into a more pulled together package that exudes new confidence, yet still oozes a basement - session bent and those sharp talking edges. The result is plain stunning, cementing Phair&#x27;s place as a songwriter for the &#x27;90s and assuring her an even wider audience.&quot;

&quot;Cashbox&quot; awarded the album their &#x27;Pick of the Week&#x27; with the reviewer commenting that &quot;this must have been how people 20 years ago felt listening to Bruce Springsteen’s early works. It’s not so much how great Liz Phair is now, as the awesome idea of how brilliant she’s likely to become... &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; is, quite simply, a stunning work from an artist that should have all music lovers in ecstasy at her arrival on the scene.&quot;

==Charts==

&quot;Whip-Smart&quot; debuted at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spent 17 weeks on the charts. The lead single &quot;Supernova&quot; received somewhat heavy rotation on radio stations and the music video was aired on MTV. The song went on to hit No. 6 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 78 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

However, despite its early success, &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; quickly departed the charts. Even though the second single and title track &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; was also successful, it failed to capture the same amount of attention of &quot;Supernova&quot;, and by the time the third single &quot;Jealousy&quot; was released, the interest in the album was much smaller. Besides this, Phair canceled her tour shortly after the album was released, causing Atlantic&#x27;s legal department to send her several letters demanding her to tour or risk defaulting on her contract. Phair stated, &quot;Basically they wanted me to be public, I wanted to be private. All these people wanted me to be really big and I felt like this tiny pea in the center of all this chaos. I didn&#x27;t want this success. I kept thinking this is wrong. Why do all these people want it so much more than I do?&quot;

According to a &quot;Billboard&quot; article, &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; has sold 412,000 copies in the US based on SoundScan sales, and is certified gold by the RIAA. As of July 2003, the album had sold 600,000 globally, making it her most commercially successful album.

<text>Olivier is an old, eroded crater that is located in the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies in a region of dense cratering on all sides. To the east-southeast is a younger but comparably sized crater named Störmer. Southwest of Olivier is the crater Volterra.

The southern rim of Olivier is covered by an unusual formation of small craters that lie adjacent to each other and have almost completely obliterated the rim. These form a line from the southwest rim to the east-southeast. Several other craters lie across the rim of Olivier, most notably a crater cutting across the northern rim and several smaller craters in the eastern rim. The remainder of the rim is worn and eroded, so that the features have become rounded and somewhat irregular.

In comparison to the rim, the interior floor is nearly flat and smooth. The most notable impact is a small craterlet near the northern rim. There are a few tiny craterlets scattered about, but nothing of significance. The crater lacks a central peak, and the only irregularities lie along the edge of the inner wall.

The crater is named after American astronomer Charles Pollard Olivier.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Olivier.

<doc id="1104242" wikidata="Q325470" url="?curid=1104242" title="Vikram Sarabhai">
<text>Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai (12 August 1919 – 30 December 1971) was an Indian physicist and astronomer who initiated space research and helped to develop nuclear power in India. Often regarded as the &quot;Father of Indian space program&quot;, Sarabhai was honored with Padma Bhushan in 1966 and the Padma Vibhushan (posthumously) in 1972.

==Personal life==

Vikram Sarabhai was born on 12 August 1919 in a Gujarati Śvetāmbara Shrimali Jain family, in Ahmedabad, India. His father was Ambalal Sarabhai a major industrialist committed to the Indian independence movement. Vikram Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini on 3 September 1942. The couple had two children. His daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist, and his son Kartikeya too became an active person in science. He attended Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the University of Cambridge, England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge to pursue his PhD and wrote a thesis, &quot;Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes&quot;, in 1947.

==Professional life==
Known as the cradle of space sciences in India, the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) was founded in 1947 by Vikram Sarabhai. PRL had a modest beginning at his residence, the &quot;RETREAT&quot;, with research on cosmic rays.

The institute was formally established at the M.G. Science Institute, Ahmedabad, on 11 November 1947 with support from the Karmkshetra Educational Foundation and the Ahmedabad Education Society. Kalpathi Ramakrishna Ramanathan was the first Director of the institute. The initial focus was research on cosmic rays and the properties of the upper atmosphere. Research areas were expanded to include theoretical physics and radio physics later with grants from the Atomic Energy Commission.
He led the Sarabhai family-owned business conglomerate.

His interests varied from science to sports to statistics. He set up the Operations Research Group (ORG), the first market research organization in the country. Most notable among the many institutes he helped set up are the Nehru Foundation for Development in Ahmedabad, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA), and the Ahmedabad Textile Industry&#x27;s Research Association (ATIRA). Along with his wife Mrinalini Sarabhai, he founded the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts. Other projects and institutions initiated or established by him include the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) in Kalpakkam, Variable Energy Cyclotron Project in Calcutta, Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) in Hyderabad and Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) in Jaduguda, Jharkhand.
Sarabhai started a project for the fabrication and launch of an Indian satellite. As a result, the first Indian satellite, Aryabhata, was put in orbit in 1975 from a Russian cosmodrome. He was the founder of Indian Space Research Organisation.

==Death==
On 30 December 1971, Sarabhai was to review the SLV design before his departure for Bombay the same night. He had spoken to A. P. J. Abdul Kalam on the telephone. Within an hour into the conversation, Sarabhai died of cardiac arrest at the age of 52 in Thiruvananthapuram (then trivandrum). His body was cremated in Ahmedabad.

==Distinguished positions==
*President of the Physics section,Indian Science Congress (1962)
*President of the General Conference of the I.A.E.A., Vienna (1970)

==Legacy==

*The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, (VSSC), which is the Indian Space Research Organization&#x27;s lead facility for launch vehicle development located in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), capital of Kerala state, is named in his memory.
*Along with other Ahmedabad-based industrialists, he played a major role in setting up of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.
*Indian Postal Department released a commemorative Postal Stamp On his first death anniversary (30 December 1972)
*In 1973, the International Astronomical Union decided that a lunar crater, Bessel A, in the Sea of Serenity will be known as the Sarabhai crater.
*The lander on India&#x27;s Moon mission Chandrayaan-2 which was to land near the South Pole of the Moon on Sep 20, 2019 was named Vikram in his honour.
*Vikram A Sarabhai Community Science Centre (VASCSC) located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat is named after him. Vikram Sarabhai established this institute around the 1960s.
*Former World Quiz Champion Vikram Joshi was named after him.
*A Space Museum was dedicated to him at B M Birla Science Centre, Hyderabad on 26 July 2019. The museum was curated by Pranav Sharma.
*ISRO&#x27;s Vikas (rocket engine) is named after him.
* On his 100th birthday on 12 August 2019, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) announced an award in the name of Vikram Sarabhai. The Vikram Sarabhai Journalism award in Space Science Technology and Research will be given to those journalists who have contributed to the fields of space science, applications, and research.

== In popular culture ==
On 12 August 2019, Google&#x27;s Doodle for India commemorated Sarabhai&#x27;s 100th birth anniversary.
On 30 September 2020, ACK Media along with ISRO released a book namely, &quot;Vikram Sarabhai: Pioneering India&#x27;s Space Programme&quot;. It was released in Amar Chitra Katha&#x27;s digital platform and merchandise, ACK Comics.

A 2022 web-series &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; was based on the fictionalized lives of Sarabhai and Homi J. Bhabha, played by Ishwak Singh and Jim Sarbh respectively

In the 2022 film &quot;&quot; based on Nambi Narayanan&#x27;s life, Sarabhai was played by Rajit Kapur in the Hindi version and by Ravi Raghavendra in the Tamil version.

<text>Whitechocolatespaceegg is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Liz Phair, released in 1998. It peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. As of July 2010, the album had sold 293,000 copies. Unlike her previous two albums, with themes of sex and relationships, &quot;Whitechocolatespaceegg&quot; focused more on motherhood and family, as Phair had recently gotten married and given birth to a son.

==Reception==

The album received generally positive reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;engagingly intimate&quot; while at the same time &quot;playful and pop-y, with just enough dry humor&quot;. The magazine also praised the album for its storytelling-esque lyrics. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; wrote that Phair had successfully proved she was &quot;no longer an unbridled twentysomething but now, at 31, a wife and mother, [who] has grown as an artist as well as a woman.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; praised the album, noting &quot;droll in her truth-telling, devastating in her offhand insights, and dazzling in her homespun rock dominion, Liz Phair is arguably the most original talent of the decade, as &quot;Whitechocolatespaceegg&quot; powerfully reaffirms. For track-to-track subtlety, poignant wit, and no- bullshit pronouncements that carry real poetic weight, Phair is the backstairs bard without peer...Phair is a truly affecting songmaker. Moreover, she can take the pop vernacular in all its jukebox/folk-pop/dancefloor familiarity and make it subversive again on superb material like &quot;Uncle
Alvarez,&quot; &quot;Only Son,&quot; &quot;Ride,&quot; and &quot;What Makes You Happy.&quot;

<text>Plaskett is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located on the northern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies only a few hundred kilometers south of the lunar north pole, and the sunlight it receives is at a low angle. The large walled plain Rozhdestvenskiy is attached to the northeast rim of Plaskett, between the crater and the pole. To the south is the overlapping crater pair of Milankovic and Ricco.

The outer rim of Plaskett has a somewhat polygonal shape formed from outward bulges in the perimeter. The inner wall is d along the southern edge, while the remainder is rougher and less finely featured. The interior floor is relatively flat and there is a central peak formed of a double-mount at the midpoint. The satellite crater Plaskett U is attached to the northwest rim.

Because of the isolation of this crater and its location near the lunar limb, it has been suggested as the ideal spot for a future lunar base. A base here would allow simulation of a mission to Mars.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Plaskett.

<doc id="1104259" wikidata="Q4753977" url="?curid=1104259" title="Andersen v. King County">
<text>Andersen v. King County, 138 P.3d 963 (Wash. 2006), formerly Andersen v. Sims, is a Washington Supreme Court case in which eight lesbian and gay couples sued King County and the state of Washington for denying them marriage licenses under the state&#x27;s 1998 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. The court ruled that banning same-sex marriage is constitutional since the legislature could reasonably believe it furthers the government&#x27;s interest in promoting procreation.

The state enacted same-sex marriage in 2012. Opponents forced a referendum on the issue, and voters approved the legislation on November 6.

==Lower court decisions==
In the case, King County Superior Court Judge William L. Downing became the first trial judge in the country to rule that a state law prohibiting same-sex marriages, or DOMA, was unconstitutional, finding for the plaintiffs on August 4, 2004. King County Superior Court Opinion by Judge William L. Downing in Andersen v. King County 

Judge Downing&#x27;s opinion in Andersen v. Sims hinged on the question of whether, as defendants and intervenors argued, restricting marriage to be between a man and a woman furthered the state&#x27;s interest in encouraging procreation. In rejecting that argument, Judge Downing cited laws recognizing the reality that a substantial amount of procreation occurs outside of the marital relationship, and noted that &quot;[m]any families today are created through adoption, the foster parent system and assisted reproduction technologies. The legal question is not,&quot; Downing wrote, &quot;whether heterosexual marriage is good for the replenishment of the species through procreation. It is. The precise question is whether barring committed same-sex couples from the benefits of the civil marriage laws somehow serves the interest of encouraging procreation. There is no logical way in which it does so.&quot; [ibid] 

Defendants and intervenors also contended that barring same-sex marriages advanced the state&#x27;s interest in ensuring that children be raised in a healthy and nurturing environment. Judge Downing agreed the state had reason to encourage stable families but found &quot;no reasonable expectation&quot; that allowing couples of two men or two women to have a state-sanctioned relationship would harm the stability of families raised by a father and mother. He then turned to the impact on children:

&quot;One, then, must try to envision two categories of future children. The first category consists of those whose heterosexual parents will either neglect them or never conceive them because same-sex marriage has been legalized. The second category is those children who will be raised in a home with same-sex adult partners and who would enjoy enhanced family stability and social adjustment if these adults were granted the benefits of civil marriage. The only reasonable conclusion is that the very real second category greatly outnumbers the first theoretical one. Therefore, the goal of nurturing and providing for the emotional wellbeing of children would be rationally served by allowing same-sex couples to marry; that same goal is impaired by prohibiting such marriages. [ibid]&quot;

Judge Downing ruled that restricting the institution of marriage to opposite sex couples &quot;is not rationally related to any legitimate or compelling state interest.&quot; [ibid] The ruling was appealed to the state Supreme Court.

==Appeal==
In 2005, the &quot;Andersen v. Sims&quot; case was consolidated with &quot;Castle v. State&quot;, another case that was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court from a lower court in Thurston County. The combined cases were filed under &quot;Andersen v. King County&quot; and Washington Supreme Court heard oral argument on March 8, 2005. On July 26, 2006, the court ruled in a 5–4 decision that the state Defense of Marriage Act was constitutional. The majority ruled that the state DOMA does not violate the state&#x27;s constitution.

==Decision==
In the plurality opinion signed by Justices Gerry L. Alexander and Charles W. Johnson, Justice Barbara Madsen wrote that &quot;Under this standard, DOMA is constitutional because the legislature was entitled to believe that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples furthers procreation, essential to the survival of the human race, and furthers the well-being of children by encouraging families where children are reared in homes headed by the children&#x27;s biological parents.&quot; Justice Gerry L. Alexander issued a separate concurring opinion, emphasizing the possibility that the legislature or people could expand the definition of marriage in the state. Justice James M. Johnson also issued a separate opinion, co-signed by Justice Richard B. Sanders, which concurred with the judgment only and suggested that the lower court rulings that held DOMA unconstitutional were result-oriented and disregarded the law. The reasoning in Madsen&#x27;s plurality opinion is similar to that of New York&#x27;s highest court in &quot;Hernandez v. Robles&quot;, which was decided on July 6, 2006.

The four justices that dissented accused the majority of relying upon &quot;circular reasoning&quot; in formulating their opinion. In the principal dissenting opinion, signed by Justices Tom Chambers, Susan Owens, and Bobbe J. Bridge, Justice Mary Fairhurst asked: &quot;Would giving same-sex couples the same right that opposite-sex couples enjoy injure the state&#x27;s interest in procreation and healthy child-rearing?&quot; Justice Tom Chambers issued a separate dissenting opinion signed by Justice Susan Owens, while Justice Bobbe J. Bridge issued another dissenting opinion.

==Aftermath==
Same-sex marriage supporters disagreed with the procreation argument and proposed Initiative 957 to challenge the court&#x27;s assertion. It would have required that all marriages recognized by the state to produce offspring within three years of their solemnization. The initiative was created by the Washington Defense of Marriage Alliance, an LGBT rights group. The Washington Defense of Marriage Alliance hoped to use this to create a test case to have a court strike down the measure and highlight what they perceived as the weakness of the &quot;Andersen&quot; decision&#x27;s logic. The initiative was filed on January 10, 2007, and withdrawn on July 3, 2007, after sponsors collected about 40,000 signatures, which was too few to qualify the measure for the November ballot.

A bill to legalize same-sex marriage passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Christine Gregoire on February 13, 2012, but opponents gathered enough signatures to force a voter referendum on the legislation. Voters approved the proposed legislation in November 2012, making same-sex marriage legal as of December 6 of that year.

Legal analysts noted the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage everywhere closely tracked the arguments put forward in 2004 in the first trial court ruling in the country that a state defense of marriage act was unconstitutional, Judge Downing&#x27;s 26-page opinion for the King County Superior Court issued August 4, 2004 -- and overturned on appeal -- that the government had no basis to argue that it banned gay marriage to benefit children. &quot;All of this may sound obvious after the fact,&quot; wrote The Seattle Times columnist Danny Westneat, &quot;But at the time Judge Downing&#x27;s ruling marked a crucial shift in the debate on gay marriage. It’s when it started to be more about love and family, rather than a civil contract for tax or inheritance purposes.&quot;

<text>Schmidt is a small lunar impact crater that is located near the southwest edge of Mare Tranquillitatis, to the southwest of the Ritter–Sabine crater pair. It was named after German astronomer Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt, German optician Bernhard Schmidt and Soviet astronomer Otto Schmidt. This formation is circular and bowl-shaped, with little appearance of wear due to subsequent impacts. The interior has a higher albedo than the surrounding terrain, giving it a light appearance. The exterior consists of hummocky terrain with many boulders, ranging up to 100 m or more in diameter.

<doc id="1104268" wikidata="Q4348272" url="?curid=1104268" title="2000 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 2000 United States Senate elections were held on November 7, 2000. The elections coincided with other federal and state elections, including the presidential election which was won by Republican George W. Bush. These elections took place 6 years after Republicans had won a net gain of eight seats in Senate Class 1. Despite George W. Bush&#x27;s victory in the presidential election, the Republicans lost four senate seats, the most a winning president&#x27;s party has lost since the passage of the 17th Amendment. This election marked the first election year since 1990 where Democrats made net gains in the Senate. Democrats defeated incumbent Republicans in Delaware, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Washington, and they won an open Republican-held seat in Florida. In Missouri, the winner was elected posthumously. The Republicans defeated Democratic incumbent Chuck Robb in Virginia, and won an open seat in Nevada. Additionally, Republican Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia died earlier in the year and was replaced by Democratic appointee Zell Miller, who then went on to win the special election.

These elections resulted in an equal 50–50 split between Republicans and Democrats, with the Vice President casting the tie-breaking votes in the Senate. This was the second tied Senate, after the results in the 1880 elections. Democrats thereby won control of the Senate briefly for only 17 days, since Al Gore was still Vice President and hense still President of the Senate at the beginning of the new term on January 3, 2001. The Republicans regained control of the chamber when the new Vice President Dick Cheney was inaugurated on January 20. However, the Republican majority would only last until June 6, 2001, when Republican Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont became an independent and caucused with the Democrats.

Until 2020, this was the last time that Democrats would win a Senate seat in Georgia. This is the last election cycle with only Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, and the last election cycle in which Republicans won seats in Rhode Island and Vermont.

Incumbent Republican Jon Kyl won re-election to a second term, as no candidate was nominated from the Democratic Party. Independent Bill Toel, Green party nominee Vance Hansen, and Libertarian party nominee Barry Hess each got more than 5% of the vote, a strong third party performance.




== California ==


The heavily financed and popular senator Dianne Feinstein (D) easily won re-election to her second full term defeating the underfunded and underdog candidate Representative Tom Campbell (R) by over 19 points. Campbell even lost his own congressional district by almost 15 points.

Primary election results:









Despite touting his service as a moderate Republican representing a strongly Democratic district, Campbell was underfunded and a decided underdog against the popular, heavily financed Feinstein. By February, he spent barely $1 million without any PAC money. Campbell has generally supported gay rights and abortion. He also opposes the War on Drugs and calls himself a &quot;maverick&quot;, similar to U.S. senator John McCain. Campbell was badly defeated, losing by over 19 points.





== Connecticut ==


Incumbent Democrat Joe Lieberman won re-election to a third term over Republican Philip Giordano, Mayor of Waterbury and former State Representative. While running for re-election, he was also Al Gore&#x27;s running mate in the 2000 presidential campaign. With Gore losing the presidency to George W. Bush, Lieberman returned to the Senate and remained there for another 13 years, when he retired. Had the Gore–Lieberman ticket won, Lieberman would have become U.S. Vice President and forced to resign his Senate seat, which would have led to a 2002 special election. It would also have led Republican Governor John G. Rowland to temporarily appoint an interim replacement.

Lieberman, a very popular centrist incumbent, focused on his vice presidential campaign. He refused to show up at the debates. Giordano was a heavy underdog, as he was ignored by the press and as he debated alone.




== Delaware ==


Incumbent Republican William Roth ran for re-election to a sixth term, but was defeated by Governor Tom Carper.

For 16 years the same four people had held the four major statewide positions. Because of term limits on the Governor&#x27;s position Thomas Carper could not run again. Both he and U.S. Representative Michael Castle wanted to be U.S. senator. Roth would not retire, and fellow Republican Castle decided against a primary.

Roth, 79, was in the U.S. Senate for 30 years. He was the Chairman of the Finance Committee. Carper, 53, was a popular Governor and former U.S. Congressman of Delaware&#x27;s At-large congressional district, who announced his major candidacy against Roth back in September 1999. Both candidates were moderates. Roth was one of the few Republicans to vote for the Brady Bill. Although Roth started the campaign with a 2-to-1 spending advantage, Carper went into the final month with more than $1 million on hand. In a contest between two popular and respected politicians, the issue seemed to be Roth&#x27;s age versus Carper&#x27;s relative youth.

Carper defeated Roth by over ten points. However, Roth received more votes than Presidential candidate George W. Bush, suggesting the strength of the Democratic turnout was a boon to Carper&#x27;s candidacy and a key element of his victory. Many consider Roth&#x27;s defeat due to his age and health, as he collapsed twice during the campaign, once in the middle of a television interview and once during a campaign event.





== Florida ==


Incumbent Republican Connie Mack III decided to retire instead of seeking a third term. Democrat Bill Nelson, State Treasurer and former U.S. Representative, won the open seat over Republican Congressman Bill McCollum.




This election was in conjunction to the presidential election, where Bush narrowly defeated Gore after an intense recount. The senate election was evenly matched with two U.S. Congressmen named Bill in their mid-50s. Both parties heavily targeted this senate seat. The election became very nasty as Nelson called his opponent &quot;an extremist who would sacrifice the elderly, the poor, and the working class to coddle the rich.&quot; McCollum called the Democrat &quot;a liberal who would tax everything that moves, and some things that don&#x27;t.&quot; The election advertisements were very negative, as both candidates talked more about each other than themselves.

Nelson raised only soft money, but had help from President Bill Clinton and VP Al Gore. Two days before the election, McCollum predicted he would win by a 6-point margin. On election day, he lost by a 5-point margin.






== Georgia (special) ==


Incumbent Democrat Zell Miller, who was appointed by Democrat Governor Roy Barnes to replace Republican Paul Coverdell following his death, won re-election to serve the remainder of the term, beating Republican Mack Mattingly, former Ambassador to Seychelles and former U.S. senator. Until 2020, when Raphael Warnock won this seat, and Jon Ossoff won the other Senate seat, this was the last Senate election in Georgia won by a Democrat and also until 2020, this was the last time the Democrats have won the Class III Senate seat from Georgia.

One of the biggest campaign issues was Social Security. Miller attacked Mattingly for supporting a raise in the retirement age. The Republican fought back by connecting him to liberal Democrat Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, and on his vote to block legislation aimed at protecting Social Security. Mattingly said he would vote for Texas Governor George W. Bush for president, who was very popular in the state and led Vice President Al Gore in many Georgia polls. Mattingly then asked Miller who he was supporting in the presidential election. Miller conceded he would vote for Gore because he helped him when he was governor including drought relief, welfare reform, and the Atlanta Olympics. &quot;That does not mean I agree with all of his policies,&quot; he concluded. In early October, a poll showed Miller leading with 59% of the vote, despite the fact that Bush was leading Gore by a double-digit margin.

&quot;Note: This election was a non-partisan election due to it being a special election. Each candidate ran without a party. The parties below reflect which party label each candidate would have run under if given the option.&quot;




== Hawaii ==


Incumbent Democrat Daniel Akaka won re-election to his second full term, over Republican John Carroll, former State senator and former State Representative.





== Indiana ==


Incumbent Republican Richard Lugar was re-elected to his fifth six-year term over Democrat David Johnson.

Lugar easily won re-election taking 66.5% one of the largest margins in a statewide race in Indiana history. Johnson only took one county, Lake County, a Democratic stronghold which borders Chicago.



== Maine ==


Incumbent Republican Olympia Snowe was re-elected to a second term, defeating Democratic candidate Mark Lawrence, former President of the Maine State Senate.

Snowe, a popular moderate incumbent, outpolled and outspent Lawrence. The two candidates agreed to debate on October 15 and 25.




== Maryland ==


Incumbent Democrat Paul Sarbanes won re-election to a fifth term over Republican Paul Rappaport, former Howard County police chief and nominee for Lieutenant Governor in 1994.

Rappaport won the Republican primary against S. Rob Sobhani, Ross Zimmerman Pierpont, Robin Ficker, Kenneth R. Timmerman, Kenneth Wayman and John Stafford through a grassroots movement with a plurality of just 23%. Rappaport, a major underdog, pushed for three debates. The four term incumbent actually agreed to one debate on October 26.



== Massachusetts ==


Incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy won re-election to his eighth (his seventh full) term. The election was notable for a strong third-party performance from Libertarian Carla Howell, who finished less than a percent behind Republican Jack E. Robinson.




== Michigan ==


Incumbent Republican Spencer Abraham ran for re-election to a second term, but was defeated by Democrat Debbie Stabenow.

Abraham, who was first elected in the 1994 Republican Revolution despite never running for public office before, was considered vulnerable by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Major issues in the campaign included prescription drugs for the elderly. By September 4, Abraham still had failed to reach 50% in polls despite having spent over $6 million on television ads. In mid-October, he came back and reached 50% and 49% in two polls respectively.

The election was very close with Stabenow prevailing by just over 67,000 votes. Stabenow was also likely helped by the fact that Al Gore won Michigan on the presidential level. Ultimately, Stabenow pulled out huge numbers of the Democratic stronghold of Wayne County, which covers the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Stabenow also performed well in other heavily populated areas such as Ingham County home to the state&#x27;s capital of Lansing, and the college town of Ann Arbor. Abraham did not concede right after major news networks declared Stabenow the winner; He held out hope that the few outstanding precincts could push him over the edge. At 4:00 am, Abraham conceded defeat. Senator Abraham called Stabenow and congratulated her on her victory. A historic election, Stabenow became the first woman to represent Michigan in the United States Senate.




== Minnesota ==


The race pitted incumbent Republican senator Rod Grams against former Minnesota State Auditor Mark Dayton.





== Mississippi ==


Incumbent Republican Trent Lott won re-election to a third term over perennial Democratic candidate Troy Brown.



== Missouri ==


Incumbent Republican John Ashcroft lost the election to Governor Mel Carnahan, despite Carnahan&#x27;s death three weeks before election day.

In 1998, Ashcroft briefly considered running for president. On January 5, 1999, he announced that he would not seek the presidency and would instead defend his Senate seat in the 2000 election. Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan announced he would contest the Senate election as a Democrat.

In the general election for the state&#x27;s seat in the U.S. Senate, Ashcroft was facing then-Governor Mel Carnahan in a &quot;tight&quot; race, despite the senator having a larger budget than Carnahan, a war chest that included significant contributions from corporations such as Monsanto Company, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, which gave five times more to Ashcroft&#x27;s campaign fund than to the fund of any other congressional hopeful at the time.

Carnahan was killed in a plane crash three weeks before the November election date. Nonetheless, Carnahan&#x27;s name remained on the ballot due to Missouri&#x27;s election laws. Lieutenant Governor Roger B. Wilson became Governor upon Carnahan&#x27;s death, to serve the remaining term of Carnahan&#x27;s governorship. Ashcroft suspended all campaigning on the day of the plane crash in light of the tragedy and resumed it eight days before the election date.

The voters of Missouri, by a margin of approximately fifty thousand votes, chose for the U.S. Senate Mel Carnahan, their Governor who had died two weeks before the election. No one had ever posthumously won election to the Senate, though voters on at least three other occasions had until then chosen deceased candidates for the House of Representatives: Clement Woodnutt Miller (D) in California in 1962; Nick Begich (D) in Alaska, 1972; and Hale Boggs (D) in Louisiana, 1972. Hence, John Ashcroft became the first U.S. Senate candidate to be defeated by a dead opponent.

Governor Roger B. Wilson appointed Carnahan&#x27;s 66-year-old widow, Jean Carnahan, to fill her husband&#x27;s vacant seat until the next cycle of Senate elections when a successor could be elected to serve out the remaining four years of the deceased Carnahan&#x27;s would-be term. Ashcroft stated that he hoped the appointment would be &quot;a matter of comfort for Mrs. Carnahan.&quot;




== Montana ==


Incumbent Republican Conrad Burns won re-election to a third term.




Though Sam Rankin won the Reform Party&#x27;s nomination for the United States Senate, he dropped out of the race over the summer and was replaced by Gary Lee.

Conrad, in a poll released September 21, was leading Schweitzer 48% to 39% that went down from 49% in November 1999. Schweitzer had his polls go up by 11 points.

Burns faced a surprisingly difficult re-election campaign in 2000. In February 1999, he announced that he would break his 1988 promise to only hold office for two terms, claiming &quot;Circumstances have changed, and I have rethought my position.&quot; Later that same month, while giving a speech about U.S. dependence on foreign oil to the Montana Equipment Dealers Association, he referred to Arabs as &quot;ragheads&quot;. Burns soon apologized, saying he &quot;became too emotionally involved&quot; during the speech.

Burns faced Brian Schweitzer, a rancher from Whitefish, Montana. While Burns attempted to link Schweitzer with presidential candidate Al Gore, whom Schweitzer never met, Schweitzer &quot;effectively portrayed himself as nonpolitical&quot;. Schweitzer primarily challenged Burns on the issue of prescription drugs, organizing busloads of senior citizens to take trips to Canada and Mexico for cheaper medicine. Burns charged that Schweitzer favored &quot;Canadian-style government controls&quot; and claimed that senior citizens went to doctors to have &quot;somebody to visit with. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with them.&quot; Burns also faced trouble regarding deaths from asbestos in Libby, Montana. While he initially supported a bill to limit compensation in such cases, he withdrew his support for the bill, under public criticism, and added $11.5 million for the town to an appropriations bill.

Burns spent twice as much money as Schweitzer on the election and only defeated him by a slim margin, 51-47 percent, while the state voted 58-33 percent for Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush. Schweitzer went on to become governor in 2004.



== Nebraska ==


Incumbent Democrat Bob Kerrey decided to retire. Democrat Ben Nelson won the open seat, beating Don Stenberg, the Republican Attorney General of Nebraska.









== Nevada ==


Incumbent Democrat Richard Bryan decided to retire, instead of seeking a third term. Republican nominee John Ensign won the open seat over Democratic attorney Ed Bernstein.








== New Jersey ==


Incumbent Democrat Frank Lautenberg decided to retire, rather than seeking a fourth term. The Democratic nominee, former CEO of Goldman Sachs Jon Corzine, defeated the Republican nominee, U.S. Representative Bob Franks, in a close election.

Senator Lautenberg, first elected to the Senate in 1982 in an upset victory over Rep. Millicent Fenwick (R-Bergen), had always been an underdog in all three bids for Senate. He beat Pete Dawkins in 1988 by a 54%-46% margin and held back a challenge from Chuck Haytaian by a smaller margin of 50%-47%. However, popular Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to challenge Lautenberg, and opinion polls showed Lautenberg losing by a large margin. He retired but later regretted his decision because Gov. Whitman and Former Governor Tom Kean both declined to run for the Senate. Lautenberg would be elected to the state&#x27;s other Senate Seat in 2002.

Corzine spent $35 million of his own money into the Democratic primary election alone when running against Jim Florio, who served as the 49th Governor of New Jersey from 1990 to 1994. Governor Florio was unpopular during his tenure in office. Most notably, he signed a $2.8 Billion tax increase in 1990. It caused his party to lose control of the state government for a decade, and cost the Governor his re-election bid in 1993.

Corzine, running as an outsider, was endorsed by State senator Raymond Zane (D-Gloucester), State senator Wayne Bryant (D-Camden), State senator John Adler (D-Camden), U.S. Representative Bob Menendez (D-Hudson) and U.S. senator Bob Torricelli (D-NJ). Florio was endorsed by the State Party, Assemblyman Joe Doria (D-Hudson) and senator John Lynch (D-Middlesex).

Corzine defeated Florio in the primary and then defeated Bob Franks in the general election.



Franks, a moderate Republican, attacked Corzine for &quot;trying to buy the election and of advocating big-government spending programs that the nation can ill afford.&quot; Corzine accused Franks of wanting to &quot;dismantle&quot; the Social Security system because he supported Governor George W. Bush&#x27;s partial privatization plan.

During the campaign, Corzine refused to release his income tax return records. He claimed an interest in doing so, but he cited a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs. Skeptics argued that he should have followed the example of his predecessor Robert Rubin, who converted his equity stake into debt upon leaving Goldman.

Corzine campaigned for state government programs including universal health care, universal gun registration, mandatory public preschool, and more taxpayer funding for college education. He pushed affirmative action and same-sex marriage. David Brooks considered Corzine so liberal that although his predecessor was also a Democrat, his election helped shift the Senate to the left.

During Corzine&#x27;s campaign for the United States Senate, he made some controversial off-color statements. When introduced to a man with an Italian name who said he was in the construction business, Corzine quipped: &quot;Oh, you make cement shoes!&quot; according to Emanuel Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice Committee. Alfano also reported that when introduced to a lawyer named David Stein, Corzine said: &quot;He&#x27;s not Italian, is he? Oh, I guess he&#x27;s your Jewish lawyer who is here to get the rest of you out of jail.&quot; Corzine denied mentioning religion, but did not deny the quip about Italians, claiming that some of his own ancestors were probably Italian, or maybe French.

Also in 2000, Corzine denied having paid off African-American ministers, when in fact the foundation controlled by him and his wife had paid one influential black church $25,000. Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, director of the Black Ministers Council, had campaigned against a form of racial profiling whereby police officers stop minority drivers and had gotten New Jersey state police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, fired. Corzine had donated to Jackson prior to getting what appears to be a reciprocal endorsement.

Franks generally trailed Corzine in the polls until the very last week, when he pulled even in a few polls. Corzine spent $63 million, while Franks spent only $6 million. Despite being heavily outspent, Franks lost by only three percentage points, doing better that year than Republican Governor George W. Bush in the presidential election, who obtained just 40% of the vote in the state.







== New Mexico ==


Incumbent Democrat Jeff Bingaman won re-election to a fourth term, beating Republican former Congressman Bill Redmond.







== New York ==


Hillary Rodham Clinton, then First Lady of the United States and the first First Lady to run for political office, defeated Congressman Rick Lazio. The general election coincided with the U.S. presidential election.

The race began in November 1998 when four-term incumbent Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D) announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates to compete for the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani&#x27;s medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.

The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman Rick Lazio to replace him. The election included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and Giuliani and national visibility. Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by Lazio solidified Clinton&#x27;s previously shaky support among women.

The contest drew considerable national attention and both candidates were well-funded. By the end of the race, Democrat Clinton and Republicans Lazio and Giuliani had spent a combined $90 million, the most of any U.S. Senate race in history. Lazio outspent Clinton $40 million to $29 million, with Clinton also getting several million dollars in soft money from Democratic organizations. Among Clinton antagonists circles, direct mail-based fundraising groups such as the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprung up, sending out solicitations regarding the &quot;carpetbagging&quot; issue: just as one Clinton leaves office, another one runs.

Clinton secured a broad base of support, including endorsements from conservation groups and organized labor, but notably not the New York City police union which endorsed Lazio while firefighters supported Hillary.
While Clinton had a solid base of support in New York City, candidates and observers expected the race to be decided in upstate New York where 45 percent of the state&#x27;s voters live. During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan would deliver 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits with the purpose of rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.
Lazio faced a unique tactical problem campaigning upstate. The major issue there was the persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent&#x27;s husband&#x27;s tenure in office. Attacks on the state of the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent Republican governor George Pataki, however, limiting the effect of this line of attack.

Opponents continued to make the carpetbagging issue a focal point throughout the race and during debates. Talk radio hammered on this, with New York-based Sean Hannity issuing a daily mantra, &quot;Name me three things Hillary Clinton has ever done for the people of New York!&quot; Clinton&#x27;s supporters pointed out that the state was receptive to national leaders, such as Robert F. Kennedy who was elected to the Senate in 1964 despite similar accusations. In the end, according to exit polls conducted in the race, a majority of the voters dismissed the carpetbagging issue as unimportant.

During the campaign, Independent Counsel Robert Ray filed his final reports regarding the long-running Whitewater, &quot;Travelgate&quot;, and &quot;Filegate&quot; investigations of the White House, each of which included specific investigations of Hillary Clinton actions. The reports exonerated her on the files matter, said there was insufficient evidence regarding her role in Whitewater, and said that she had made factually false statements regarding the Travel Office firings but there was insufficient evidence to prosecute her. Although &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorialized that the release of the reports seemed possibly timed to coincide with the Senate election, in practice the findings were not seen as likely to sway many voters&#x27; opinions.

A September 13, 2000, debate between Lazio and Clinton proved important. Lazio was on the warpath against soft money and the amounts of it coming from the Democratic National Committee into Clinton&#x27;s campaign, and challenged Clinton to agree to ban soft money from both campaigns. He left his podium and waved his proposed paper agreement in Clinton&#x27;s face; many debate viewers thought he had invaded her personal space and as a result Clinton&#x27;s support among women voters solidified.

Late in the campaign Lazio criticised Clinton for accepting campaign donations from various Arab groups in the wake of the attack. This issue caused former New York Mayor Ed Koch to take out ads telling Lazio to &quot;stop with the sleaze already,&quot; and did not change the dynamic of the race.








:&quot;Per New York State law, Clinton and Lazio totals include their minor party line votes: Liberal Party of New York and Working Families Party for Clinton, Conservative Party for Lazio.&quot;

Clinton won the election on November 7 with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio&#x27;s 43 percent, a difference larger than most observers had expected. Clinton won the traditionally Democratic base of New York City by large margins, and carried suburban Westchester County, but lost heavily populated Long Island, part of which Lazio represented in Congress. She won surprising victories in Upstate counties, such as Cayuga, Rensselaer, and Niagara, to which her win has been attributed.

In comparison with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore&#x27;s 25 point margin over Bush in the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D&#x27;Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which senator Schumer won re-election in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, because in recent decades the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.

Lazio&#x27;s bid was handicapped by the weak performance of George W. Bush in New York in the 2000 election, but it was also clear Hillary Clinton had made substantial inroads in upstate New York prior to Lazio&#x27;s entry into the race. Exit polls also showed a large gender gap with Clinton running stronger than expected among moderate women and unaffiliated women.

== North Dakota ==


Incumbent Dem-NPL U.S. senator Kent Conrad won re-election to a third term, over Republican Naval Reserve officer Duane Sand.



== Ohio ==


Incumbent Republican Mike DeWine won re-election to a second term, beating Democrat Ted Celeste, real estate developer and brother of former Ohio Governor Dick Celeste.








== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican Rick Santorum won re-election to a second term over Democratic Congressman Ron Klink.

Santorum had gained a reputation as a polarizing figure during his first term in the Senate, but he entered the race with a large fundraising advantage and high levels of support from the political right. The contest began for Democrats with a brutal primary challenge; U.S. Congressman Klink narrowly bested State senator Allyson Schwartz and former Lieutenant Governor nominee Tom Foley by running on the message that he was the only candidate capable of defeating the Republican. Klink was viewed as a viable choice because he was a traditional Democrat on most issues and had strong union ties but also was pro-life, which Democrats hoped would return votes to their party in the heavily Catholic but economically liberal coal regions of the state. However, enthusiasm around Klink&#x27;s campaign quickly waned. Liberal Democrats, particularly in the Philadelphia area, balked at donating to a socially conservative candidate who was almost unknown in their area. He was also badly outspent, leaving him unable to expand his presence in the state; he didn&#x27;t run a single ad on Philadelphia television. Santorum, in contrast, successfully balanced his national recognition on social issues with local concerns en route to a surprisingly large victory.




== Rhode Island ==


Incumbent Republican Lincoln Chafee was elected his first full term after being appointed in 1999 to fill the seat of his father, the previous Senator, John Chafee who died on October 24, 1999, a few months after the elder Chafee announced his retirement instead of seeking a fifth term. As of 2022, this is the last Senate election in Rhode Island won by a Republican.







== Tennessee ==


Incumbent Republican Bill Frist won re-election to a second term.

The Democratic primary was held August 3, 2000. In a field of five candidates, Jeff Clark, a professor at Middle Tennessee State University, edged out John Jay Hooker to win the nomination.








== Texas ==


Incumbent Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison won re-election to a second term, beating Democrat Gene Kelly, a retired attorney.




== Utah ==


Incumbent Republican Orrin Hatch won re-election to a fifth term, beating Democratic State senator Scott N. Howell.




== Vermont ==


Incumbent Republican Jim Jeffords won re-election to a third term in office, over Ed Flanagan, Vermont Auditor of Accounts. Jeffords switched from being a Republican to an independent, who would later caucus with the Democratic Party following the 2000 election in May 2001, thus breaking the 50-50 lock. As of 2022, this is the last Senate election in Vermont won by a Republican.










== Virginia ==


Incumbent Democrat Chuck Robb ran for a third term, but lost to Republican George Allen.




== Washington ==


Incumbent Republican Slade Gorton ran for a third consecutive term (fourth overall), but was unseated for a second time (the first being 1986) by Democratic candidate, former Congresswoman Maria Cantwell.

Since Maria Cantwell had only won by 1,953 votes, or a margin of 0.08 percent, an automatic recount was triggered. Cantwell won the recount on December 1 with a margin of 2,229 votes (0.09%) in one of the closest elections in Washington state history.




== West Virginia ==


Incumbent Democrat Robert Byrd won re-election to an eighth term. He won every county and congressional district in the state.



== Wisconsin ==


Incumbent Democrat Herb Kohl won re-election to a third term.



== Wyoming ==

<text>Theon Junior is a lunar impact crater that is located just to the west-southwest of the crater Delambre. It forms a matching pair with Theon Senior, only a couple of crater diameters to the north-northwest. The crater is circular and bowl-shaped, with a small floor at the bottom of the high, sloping interior walls. It is named for Theon of Alexandria, a 4th-century Greek astronomer and mathematician. The crater is from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago. It is 17 kilometers in diameter and the difference in height at its rim and its deepest part is 3,580 meters.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Theon Junior.

<doc id="1104272" wikidata="Q6660268" url="?curid=1104272" title="Liz Phair (album)">
<text>Liz Phair is the fourth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Liz Phair, released on June 24, 2003, on Capitol Records. It was produced by Phair, Michael Penn, Pete Yorn, R. Walt Vincent and the Matrix songwriting team.

&quot;Liz Phair&quot; departed from Phair&#x27;s earlier lo-fi sound for more polished pop production and songwriting. Phair said she wanted to earn more money from her work, and hired the Matrix, who had produced songs by pop acts including Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, Ricky Martin and Avril Lavigne. The Matrix co-wrote four songs, including the singles &quot;Extraordinary&quot; and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I?&quot;.

&quot;Liz Phair&quot; debuted at #27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I?&quot; entered the Adult Top 40 and Hot Adult Contemporary charts, and its music video placed Phair in heavy rotation on VH1 for the first time. By July 2010, &quot;Liz Phair&quot; had sold 433,000 copies. It was certified gold in the US in 2018.

&quot;Liz Phair&quot; received mixed reviews, including negative reviews from the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who both accused Phair of selling out and mimicking younger artists. It earned more positive reviews from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2019, the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Matt LeMay apologized for his review, saying he had failed to appreciate Phair&#x27;s willingness to try different approaches.

==Background==
Phair released her debut album, &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;, in 1993. With a raw, lo-fi sound and &quot;punk-feminist&quot; lyrics, it was acclaimed by critics and was eventually certified gold. Her subsequent albums &quot;Whip-Smart&quot; (1994) and &quot;Whitechocolatespaceegg&quot; (1998) were less successful.

In 1999, Phair&#x27;s record label, Matador, was acquired by the major record label Capitol. Phair said the acquisition complicated her work, as it meant she had to work with many more people, many of whom had different aims. The Matador staff she had worked with left, leaving her under pressure at Capitol. Phair described seeing &quot;manufactured&quot; bands achieve success while she had no &quot;indie-cool group&quot; to advise her. According to Phair, Andy Slater, the CEO of Capitol, told her: &quot;I&#x27;m giving you a shot and if you don&#x27;t take the shot, there&#x27;s nothing much I can do for you.&quot;

For her fourth album, Phair, now in her 30s, wanted to &quot;feel more like an entrepreneur, not just a dumb artist&quot;, and be better rewarded for her work. She said: &quot;I think with many artists there is a gambling spirit – just get out there and don&#x27;t watch out for yourself – and I think it&#x27;s a very unhealthy attitude to assume that you&#x27;re not in business when you actually are.&quot;

== Recording ==

Phair worked with several producers, including the Matrix team, Michael Penn, Pete Yorn and Yorn&#x27;s producer R. Walt Vincent. Phair and Penn worked in the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles. Phair said in October 2001: &quot;He places me in it so beautifully. He&#x27;ll do things like get an industrial sound and replace it for a snare drum. It&#x27;s one of the most intense-sounding things I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; Their collaboration ended as, according to Phair, &quot;He tended to like my more serious stuff and he wouldn&#x27;t let me make a fool of myself, and I really needed to make a little bit of a fool of myself.&quot;

Searching for &quot;more spontaneous stuff&quot;, Phair recruited the Matrix, who had created songs for pop acts including Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, Ricky Martin and Avril Lavigne. Phair said she envied Lavigne&#x27;s 2002 song &quot;Complicated&quot;, and said: &quot;How come I don&#x27;t ever get to make songs that are blasted out of cars? That&#x27;s one of the things I&#x27;ve always done my whole life is drive fast and play music loud.&quot; The Matrix wrote and produced four songs with Phair: &quot;Extraordinary&quot;, &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I?&quot;, &quot;Rock Me&quot; and &quot;Favorite&quot;. Phair said they pushed her to sing different kinds of melodies: &quot;It&#x27;s top-of-the-line song structure, and it was really exciting to graft my DNA with theirs and to see what we came up with.&quot;

Phair deliberated over whether to include the song &quot;HWC&quot;, which stands for &quot;hot white cum&quot;. She said she wrote it &quot;completely sincerely ... I&#x27;m talking about being in love and having great sex.&quot; She said her female friends loved the song, but that &quot;grown men had a lot of problems with it&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Liz Phair&quot; debuted at #27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The single &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I?&quot; entered the Adult Top 40 and Hot Adult Contemporary charts, and its music video placed Phair in heavy rotation on VH1 for the first time. By July 2010, &quot;Liz Phair&quot; had sold 433,000 copies. It was certified gold in the United States on May 14, 2018, for sales of 500,000 copies. The album included a download for an EP, &quot;Comeandgetit&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

According to the review aggregator site Metacritic, &quot;Liz Phair&quot; received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. The polished production and pop songwriting, a departure from Phair&#x27;s earlier work, alienated many listeners. According to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Liz Phair&quot; &quot;inspired some of the most vitriolic music press in ages, with bad (and surprisingly personal) reviews outgunning the occasional good ones by a huge margin&quot;. Many accused Phair of selling out; she became a &quot;piñata for critics&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Meghan O&#x27;Rourke titled her review &quot;Liz Phair&#x27;s Exile in Avril-ville&quot;, and complained that Phair &quot;gushes like a teenager&quot;, having &quot;committed an embarrassing form of career suicide&quot;. Matt LeMay of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; rated the album 0.0, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s sad that an artist as groundbreaking as Phair would be reduced to cheap publicity stunts and hyper-commercialized teen-pop.&quot; The &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Adrien Begrand wrote that it was &quot;a highly overproduced, shallow, soulless, confused, pop-by-numbers disaster that betrays everything the woman stood for a decade ago, and most heinously, betrays all her original fans&quot;. In the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Adam Sweeting wrote that Phair&#x27;s lyrics, once &quot;smart and provocative&quot;, had become &quot;crass and bloated&quot;, and criticized the sexualized cover photograph.

In the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot;, Laura Bond wrote that &quot;the problem with &quot;Liz Phair&quot; isn&#x27;t so much that Phair&#x27;s making a bid for the mainstream; it&#x27;s that she hasn&#x27;t done so particularly well&quot;. She found the singles &quot;Extraordinary&quot; and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I?&quot; irritating, feeling they sounded desperate instead of confident, and found the lyrics &quot;oversexed and silly&quot; and &quot;sometimes just plain base&quot;. Bond contrasted the lyrics with &quot;Exile from Guyville&quot;, which she argued used sexuality to explore other topics, such as &quot;the vast murky territories that lie between men and women&quot;. Bond felt the sexuality of &quot;Liz Phair&quot; instead &quot;feels like the pseudo-sensual posturing of a woman who aspires to join the MTV harem&quot;. She felt that the songs Phair wrote alone were the album&#x27;s best and &quot;suggest the wit, honesty and flawed humanity that made her endearing in the first place&quot;.

In &quot;Blender&quot;, Ann Powers wrote: &quot;It isn&#x27;t clear whether Phair knows that audacity as a strategy has diminishing returns; what once shocked now seems like a habit.&quot; She said that the best songs &quot;cut through the bullshit to portray a hot young mom reflecting on lust and guilt&quot;, and hoped that listeners would hear the intelligence beyond the production values. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Chris Willman described &quot;Liz Phair&quot; as &quot;an honestly fun summer disc&quot;, noting &quot;Little Digger&quot; and &quot;Rock Me&quot; as highlights. The &quot;Slant&quot; critic Sal Cinquemani also praised it, calling Phair &quot;frank and funny&quot; and citing &quot;It&#x27;s Sweet&quot;, &quot;My Bionic Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Rock Me&quot; as noteworthy tracks. Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that it included &quot;no bad songs&quot;, and credited Phair for &quot;successfully fusing the personal and the universal, challenging lowest-common-denominator values even as it fellates them&quot;. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Barry Walters wrote that &quot;Rock Me&quot; and &quot;Little Dagger&quot; matched the &quot;lofty songwriting standard&quot; of &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;, and concluded: &quot;Phair is a fine lyricist, and although she&#x27;s lost some musical identity, she&#x27;s gained potential Top Forty access.&quot;

Phair said of the criticism: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like they involve me in some kind of political scenario. It&#x27;s like, &#x27;Oh, no! She changed her platform! This isn&#x27;t what she campaigned on!&#x27; Which is good, because it means that they were really attached to the earlier work.&quot; She said that while she enjoyed obscure music, she also listened to commercial pop music and that her aversion to the &quot;rigid&quot; attitudes of indie and alternative music had inspired &quot;Exile from Guyville&quot;. Phair said she liked to &quot;encompass opposites&quot;, and wanted to express different sides of her personality with her records. 

=== Retrospective ===

In 2018, Travis Morrison, who also received a 0.0 score from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; for his 2004 album &quot;Travistan&quot;, said he thought &quot;Liz Phair&quot; was Phair&#x27;s &quot;most visionary gesture&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Now hipsters listen to Carly Rae Jepsen and no one thinks about it. But Liz Phair was pretty ahead of that curve. And she really got some nasty shit about it. Mostly, of course, from white male &#x27;critics&#x27;.&quot;

In 2019, Phair said she felt O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; review had attempted to shame her for dressing and acting sexually as a mother and for trying to reach a broader audience. She said: &quot;Meghan ought to try wearing some hot clothes and having a good time. She might be happier.&quot; She said her experience with the album had been &quot;challenging, but good&quot;, and that it had helped her &quot;grow a lot as a performer. I did something I was scared to do, like finding my path in a whole new [way]. It&#x27;s like moving to a new city and making new friends and trying to be a different person.&quot; Phair said she was &quot;kind of proud&quot; of the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; 0.0 rating.

In 2018, asked about the criticism &quot;Liz Phair&quot; had received from outlets such as &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Christgau wrote:

In 2019, LeMay apologized on Twitter for his &quot;condescending and cringey&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; review, writing:

Phair responded to LeMay on Twitter: &quot;I&#x27;ve always enjoyed criticism well-rendered and the 0.0 had some humor to it — enjoyed it more than others I can tell you.&quot; In 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included &quot;Liz Phair&quot; on its list of scores they &quot;would change if they could&quot;, upgrading its score to 6.0.
