<text>Thuvia, Maid of Mars is a science fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the fourth of the &quot;Barsoom&quot; series. The principal characters are Carthoris (the son of John Carter of Mars) and Thuvia of Ptarth, each of whom appeared in the previous two novels. 

== Plot introduction ==

In this novel the focus shifts from John Carter, Warlord of Mars, and Dejah Thoris of Helium, protagonists of the first three books in the series, to their son, Carthoris, prince of Helium, and Thuvia, princess of Ptarth. Helium and Ptarth are both prominent Barsoomian city state/empires, and both Carthoris and Thuvia were secondary characters in the previous two novels.

Its plot devices are similar to the previous Martian novels, involving the kidnapping of a Martian princess. This time John Carter&#x27;s son Carthoris is implicated. It does however have some inventive and original ideas, including an autopilot and collision detection device for Martian fliers, and the creation of the Lotharians, a race of ancient Martians who have become adept at telepathic projection, able to create imaginary warriors that can kill, and sustain themselves through thought alone.

== Plot summary ==
Carthoris is madly in love with Thuvia. This love was foreshadowed at the end of the previous novel. Unfortunately Thuvia is promised to Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol. On Barsoom nothing can break an engagement between a man and woman except death, although the new suitor may not cause that death. Thus it is that Thuvia will have none of him. This situation leaves Carthoris in a predicament.

As Thuvia suffers the common Burroughsian heroine&#x27;s fate of being kidnapped and in need of rescue, Carthoris&#x27; goal is abetted by circumstances. Thus he sets out to find the love of his life. His craft is sabotaged and he finds himself deep in the undiscovered south of Barsoom, in the ruins of ancient Aanthor. Thuvia&#x27;s kidnappers, the Dusar, have taken her there as well, and Carthoris is just in time to spot Thuvia and her kidnappers under assault by a green man of the hordes of Torquas. Carthoris leaps to her rescue in the style of his father.

The rescue takes Carthoris and his love to ancient Lothar, home of an ancient fair-skinned human race gifted with the ability to create lifelike phantasms from pure thought. They habitually use large numbers of phantom bowmen paired with real and phantom (Barsoomian lions) to defend themselves from the hordes of Torquas.

The kidnapping of Thuvia is done in such a way that Carthoris is blamed. This ignites a war between the red nations of Barsoom. Carthoris must try to be back in time with Thuvia to stop the war from breaking loose. Carthoris wonders if his love will ever be requited by the promised Thuvia.

==Background==
Burroughs began writing &quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot;, in April 1914, at the time describing it as a &#x27;Carthoris&#x27; story. After a break in California, he had begun a furious writing schedule, including other works as well as what was to become &quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot;. A new editor, Robert H. Davis, had replaced Newell Metcalf, the previous editor of &quot;All-Story Magazine&quot; (which had published Burrough&#x27;s previous Barsoom novels), at the now amalgamated &quot;All-story Cavalier Weekly&quot;. Davis wrote to Burroughs on June 12, 1914 after reading previous fiction (including Tarzan), suggesting ideas and suggesting a meeting. Burroughs finished the story on June 20, 1914. Burroughs reached New York on June 23, and several days later mailed the finished typescript of what was still entitled &quot;Carthoris&quot;, describing it as &quot;another Martian story&quot; he wished &quot;to sell for use in &quot;All-Story Cavalier Weekly&quot;&quot;.

==Publication==
The finished story was first published in &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot; as a serial in three parts on April 8, 15, and 22, 1916. It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in October, 1920.

== Genre ==
The novel can be classed as a planetary romance. This genre is a subset of science fiction, similar to sword and sorcery, but including scientific elements. Most of the action in a planetary romance is on the surface of an alien world, usually includes sword fighting, monsters, supernatural elements as telepathy rather than magic, and involves civilizations echoing those on Earth in pre-technological eras, particularly composed of kingdoms or theocratic nations. Spacecraft may appear, but are usually not central to the story.

==Major characters==
*Carthoris: Son of John Carter and Dejah Thoris who inherits his father&#x27;s superior strength and ability with a sword. A minor character in The Gods of Mars. A principal character in &quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot; and love interest of Thuvia.
*Thuvia of Ptarth: A Princess of Ptarth. She first appears in The Gods of Mars, among a group of Red Martians rescued by John Carter from the nefarious Therns who maintain the illusion of the Martian &#x27;Heaven&#x27; in the Valley of Dor. She is later imprisoned with John Carter&#x27;s wife Dejah Thoris, in a temple prison which can only be opened once per year and remains by her side for much of the novel and the sequel The Warlord of Mars. Like many of Burroughs Martian heroines, she is tough, courageous, proud and strongly identifies with her aristocratic position in Martian society. Also typically, she is abducted by evildoers (her rescue providing primary motivation for the plot of Thuvia, Maid of Mars) who wish to use her for political gain — in this case by Astok, Prince of Dusar, who blames the kidnapping on Cathoris.
*Kar Komak: A Lotharian bowman, with a noble and chivalrous personality (unlike the majority of the remaining Lotharians). While initially one of the phantoms projected by the Lotharians to fight off the Green Martian attacks on Lothar, he assumes a corporeal form after Carthoris and Thuvia leave Lothar, and turns out to have been a real Lotharian from the distant past. He joins the pair, fighting in the battles that follow. He is also able to create his own phantom bowmen to assist in combat.

==Setting==

===Scientific basis===
Burroughs&#x27; vision of Mars was loosely inspired by astronomical speculation of the time, especially that of Percival Lowell, who saw the planet as a formerly Earthlike world now becoming less hospitable to life due to its advanced age, whose inhabitants had built canals to bring water from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arable land. Lowell was influenced by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli, who in 1878, had observed features on Mars he called canali (Italian for &quot;channels&quot;). Mistranslation of this into English as &quot;canals&quot; fuelled belief the planet was inhabited. The theory of an inhabited planet with flowing water was disproved by data provided by Russian and American probes such as the two Viking missions which found a dead, frozen world where water could not exist in a fluid state.

===World of Barsoom===

A million years before the narrative commences, Mars was a lush world with oceans. As the oceans receded, and the atmosphere grew thin, the planet has devolved into a landscape of partial barbarism; living on an aging planet, with dwindling resources, the inhabitants of Barsoom have become hardened and warlike, fighting one another to survive. Barsoomians distribute scarce water supplies via a worldwide system of canals, controlled by quarreling city-states. The thinning Martian atmosphere is artificially replenished from an &quot;atmosphere plant.&quot;

It is a world with clear territorial divisions between White-, Yellow-, Black-, Red-, and Green-skinned races. Each has particular traits and qualities, which seem to define the characters of almost every individual within them. Burroughs&#x27;s concept of race in Barsoom is more similar to species, rather than ethnicity.

===Technology===
The Red Martians of Barsoom have fliers operating with a form of anti-gravity. &quot;Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot; is notable in that John Carter&#x27;s son, Carthoris, invents an apparent precursor of the autopilot (decades before an actual device was perfected). The mechanism allowed the pilot to reach any destination on Barsoom, although it required the pilot to keep the craft pointed in the right direction. Upon arrival, the mechanism also lowered the flier to the ground. Carthoris&#x27; flier was also equipped with an anti-collision device, which detected obstacles and automatically steered around them.

==Themes==
While Burroughs is generally seen as a writer who produced work of limited philosophical value, Burroughs wrote two Barsoom novels that appear to explore, or parody, the limits of excessive intellectual development at the expense of bodily or physical existence.&quot; Thuvia, Maid of Mars&quot;, with its depiction of the Lotharians is the first. The Lotharians have mostly died out. They had been fleeing from the attacks of Green Martians, during which most of them were killed (including all women and children), when they found a defensible location and came to a dramatic realization that the mind is everything, and hence developed advanced telepathic powers including the ability to create phantom bowmen to combat their Green Martian adversaries. Such is the detail of their power of imagination that the bowmen even appear to die in combat, and the Green Martians are killed by their arrows. A Lotharian, Jav, explains to the protagonist, Carthoris, that the illusion is only maintained by the belief of the Green Martians. If they knew the truth it would not be effective.

The Lotharians also maintain the illusion of a functioning, normal Barsoomian society through powerful telepathic projections. They have formed two factions, which appear to portray the excesses of pointless intellectual debate - one faction, the realists, believes in imagining meals to provide sustenance, another, the , believes in surviving without eating.

The Chessmen of Mars is the second example of this trend. The Kaldanes have sacrificed their bodies to become pure brain, but although they can interface with Rykor bodies, their ability to function compared to a normal people, with an integrated mind and body, is ineffectual and clumsy.

<doc id="1097527" wikidata="Q2432003" url="?curid=1097527" title="Deep-submergence vehicle">
<text>A deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) is a deep-diving crewed submersible that is self-propelled. Several navies operate vehicles that can be accurately described as DSVs. DSVs are commonly divided into two types: research DSVs, which are used for exploration and surveying, and DSRVs (deep-submergence rescue vehicles), which are intended to be used for rescuing the crew of a sunken navy submarine, clandestine (espionage) missions (primarily installing wiretaps on undersea communications cables), or both. DSRVs are equipped with docking chambers to allow personnel ingress and egress via a manhole.

Strictly speaking, bathyscaphes are not submarines because they have minimal mobility and are built like a balloon, using a habitable spherical pressure vessel hung under a liquid hydrocarbon filled float drum. In a DSV/DSRV, the passenger compartment and the ballast tank functionality is incorporated into a single structure to afford more habitable space (up to 24 people in the case of a DSRV).

Most DSV/DSRV vehicles are powered by traditional electric battery propulsion and have very limited endurance, while a few (like NR-1 or AS-12/31) are/were nuclear-powered, and could sustain much longer missions. Plans have been made to equip DSVs with LOX Stirling engines, but none have been realized so far due to cost and maintenance considerations. All DSVs to date (2023) are dependent on a surface support ship or a mother submarine that can piggyback or tow them (in case of the NR-1) to the scene of operations. Some DSRV vessels are air transportable in very large military cargo planes to speed up deployment in case of emergency rescue missions.

==List of deep submergence vehicles==

===&quot;Trieste&quot;-class bathyscaphes===
; FNRS-2 : The first bathyscaphe, developed by Swiss engineer Auguste Piccard and named after the Belgian Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS), the funding organization for the venture. FNRS also funded the &quot;FNRS-1,&quot; a balloon that set a world altitude record, also built by Piccard. This bathyscaphe consisted of a gasoline filled float, 22 feet long and 10 feet wide, and oval shaped. Gasoline being less dense than water, would provide buoyancy for when the bathyscaphe needed to rise to the surface. The ovular float was divided into six tanks for holding gasoline, having a combined total of 6,600 gallons.

; FNRS-3 : After damage to the &quot;FNRS-2&quot; during its sea trials in 1948, the FNRS ran out of funding and the submersible was sold to the French Navy in 1950. It was subsequently substantially rebuilt and improved at Toulon naval base, and renamed &quot;FNRS-3&quot;. It was relaunched in 1953 under the command of Georges Houot, a French naval officer.

; DSV-0 &quot;Trieste&quot; : The X-1 &quot;Trieste&quot; bathyscaphe has reached Challenger Deep, the world&#x27;s deepest seabed. It was retired in 1966.

; DSV-1 X-2 &quot;Trieste II&quot; : An updated bathyscaphe design, it participated in clandestine missions. &quot;Trieste II&quot; was retired in 1984.

===&quot;Alvin&quot;-class submersibles===
Originally designed for operation, and initially built to a similar design, Alvin and her sister submersibles have been subsequently, independently upgraded. Utilizing syntactic foam, these submersibles were more compact and maneuverable than earlier bathyscaphes like Trieste, although not as deep diving.

; DSV-2 &quot;Alvin&quot; : Launched in June 1964 with an initial depth capability of ; rebuilt in 1973 to . Owned by the United States Navy and operated under secondment by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) where it conducts science-oriented missions funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Office of Naval Research (ONR). &quot;Alvin&quot; operates from R/V &quot;Atlantis&quot;, an AGOR-23 class vessel owned by the ONR and operated by WHOI under a charter party agreement. In 2004, the National Science Foundation funded a capable replacement for Alvin, however the key components, such as a new titanium personnel hull, and funding were used to substantially rebuild Alvin in 2011 and 2020 instead. In 2022, Alvin was certified for 6,500 m operations.
; DSV-3 &quot;Turtle&quot; : &quot;Alvin&quot;″s identical sibling, launched in December 1968 and retired 1998. Owned and operated by the United States Navy.
; DSV-4 &quot;Sea Cliff&quot; : Another &quot;Alvin&quot;-class DSV sub, launched in December 1968, retired in 1998, and returned to active service in September 2002. Since 1981, &quot;Sea Cliff&quot; has a depth capability of , and is owned and operated by the United States Navy.
; DSV-5 &quot;Nemo&quot; : Another &quot;Alvin&quot;-class DSV sub, launched in June 1970 and retired in 1998. Owned and operated by the United States Navy.

===&quot;Star&quot;-class DSV===
; &quot;Star II&quot;
; &quot;Star III&quot;

Both &quot;Star II&quot; and &quot;Star III&quot; were built by General Dynamics Electric Boat Division in Groton, Connecticut. Both were launched on May 3, 1966, and were used for civilian research.

===NR-1–class DSVN===
; NR-1 : a decommissioned US Navy nuclear powered research and clandestine DSV submarine, which could roll on the seabed using large balloon wheels.

===&quot;Aluminaut&quot;===
; &quot;Aluminaut&quot; : a DSV made completely of aluminum by the Reynolds Metals Aluminum Company, for the US Navy, once held the submarine deep diving record. It is no longer operational.

===&quot;Deepsea Challenger&quot;===
; &quot;Deepsea Challenger&quot; : a DSV made by the Acheron Project Pty Ltd, has reached Challenger Deep, the world&#x27;s deepest seabed.

=== &quot;Limiting Factor&quot; ===
A submersible commissioned by Caladan Oceanic and designed and built by Triton Submarines of Sebastian, Florida. On December 19, 2018, it was the first crewed submersible to reach the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, or 8,376 meters in the Brownson Deep, thus making it the deepest diving, currently operational submersible. In August 2019, the submersible and its pilot, Victor Vescovo, completed the &quot;Five Deeps Expedition&quot; with its support ship, the DSSV &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, becoming the first submersible to visit the bottom of all five of the world&#x27;s oceans. Earlier that same month, a team of explorers and scientists used Limiting Factor to visit the wreck of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in the North Atlantic Ocean. On March 31, 2021, Caladan Oceanic announced having re-located, surveyed, and filmed the wreck of the World War II destroyer , sunk on October 25, 1944, in the Battle off Samar (in the Philippine Sea off Samar Island). &quot;Johnston&quot; lies at depth of , making &quot;Limiting Factor&quot;″s expedition the deepest wreck dive in history.

===Priz-class DSRV===
; Priz : a DSRV class of five ships built by the USSR and Russia. The titanium-hulled Priz class are capable of diving to . These mini-submarines can ferry up to 20 people for very brief periods of time (in case of a rescue mission) or operate submerged for two to three days with a regular crew of three to four specialists. In early 2005, the Russian AS-28 Priz vessel was trapped undersea and subsequently freed by a British ROV in a successful international rescue effort.

===Mir===
; &quot;Mir&quot; : a strictly civilian (research) class of two DSVs which were manufactured in Finland for the USSR. These bathyscaphe-derived vessels can carry three people down to depths of . After visiting and filming the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s wreck, the two &quot;Mir&quot; submersibles and their support ship were loaned to a US Pacific trench surveying mission in the late 1990s and made important discoveries concerning sulphuric based life in &quot;black smokers&quot;.

===Kalitka-class DSVN===
; AS-12 : a Russian counterpart to the American NR-1 clandestine nuclear DSV, is a relatively large, deep-diving nuclear submarine of 2,000 tons submerged displacement that is intended for oceanographic research and clandestine missions. It has a titanium pressure hull consisting of several conjoined spheres and able to withstand tremendous pressure — during the 2012 research mission it routinely dove to , with maximum depth being said to be approximately . Despite the three-month mission time allowed by its nuclear reactor and ample food stores it usually operates in conjunction with a specialized tender, a refurbished Delta III-class submarine BS-136 Orenburg, which has its missile shafts removed and fitted with a special docking cradle on its bottom.

===&quot;Konsul&quot;-class DSV===
; &quot;Konsul&quot; : a class of Russian military DSVs currently deployed onboard the Russian oceanographic research ship &quot;Yantar&quot;. It is reported that the submersible and its sister sub &quot;Rus&quot; are used to conduct seafloor surveillance of marine communications cables and western underwater surveillance devices. They are somewhat smaller than the &quot;Mir&quot;″s, accommodating a crew of two instead of three, but are purely domestically produced vessels and have a higher maximum depth due to their titanium pressure hulls: during the tests the original &quot;Konsul&quot; dove to .

===&quot;Nautile&quot;===
; &quot;Nautile&quot; : a DSV owned by Ifremer, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea. The titanium-hulled &quot;Nautile&quot; is capable of diving to .

===&quot;Shinkai&quot;===
; DSV &quot;Shinkai&quot; : JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology) operated a DSV series called &quot;Shinkai&quot; (&quot;Deep Sea&quot;). The latest DSV is &quot;Shinkai 6500&quot; which could submerge to with three crew members. JAMSTEC was operating a ROV called &quot;Kaikō&quot;, which was able to submerge to , but was lost at sea in May 2003.

===&quot;Pisces&quot;-class DSV===
; &quot;Pisces&quot;-class DSV : three-person research submersibles built by International Hydrodynamics of Vancouver in British Columbia with a maximum operating depth of capable of dive durations of 7 to 10 hours. A total of 10 were built and are representative of late 1960s deep-ocean submersible design. Two (&quot;Pisces IV&quot; and &quot;Pisces V&quot;) are currently operated by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the first production vehicle is on display in Vancouver. &quot;Pisces VI&quot; is active and operating from Tenerife, in the Canary Islands.

===&quot;Sea Pole&quot;-class bathyscaphe===
Bathyscaphe series designed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and there are three derivatives known to exist by 2010:
; &quot;Sea Pole&quot;-class bathyscaphe : 1 built, 2nd unit developed into Jiaolong (Described below)
; &quot;Jiaolong&quot;-class bathyscaphe : Subclass of &quot;Sea Pole&quot; class, 1 built.
; &quot;Harmony&quot;-class bathyscaphe: Subclass of &quot;Jiaolong&quot; class, 1 built.

===&quot;Fendouzhe&quot; DSV===
; &quot;Fendouzhe&quot;, or &quot;Striver&quot;-class: a Chinese DSV that dove to an estimated depth of 10,909 meters in the Mariana Trench on November 10, 2020, the deepest ever for a Chinese submersible. It was supported by its mother ship, the &quot;Tansuo-1&quot; (&quot;Exploration-1&quot;) and its development began in 2016. The chief designer of the sub, Liu Yeyao, and two other Chinese oceanauts made the descent in what was the first three-person, welded titanium capsule to venture to full ocean depth.

===&quot;Deep Sea Warrior&quot; bathyscaphe===
; &quot;Deep sea warrior&quot; or &quot;Shen-Hai Yong-Shi&quot;: developed by China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation in 2017 and capable of diving up to a depth of 4,500 meters.

===&quot;Ictineu 3&quot;===

; &quot;Ictineu 3&quot; : a three-person crewed DSV. The hull is made of inox steel and it has a large semi-spheric acrylic glass viewport. It is designed to reach depths of , thus being the ninth-deepest submersible, and it is capable of diving during 10 hours using li-ion batteries.

===&quot;Matsya 6000&quot;===
; &quot;Matsya 6000&quot; DSV : an Indian under-development crewed deep-submergence vehicle intended to be utilised for deep sea exploration of rare minerals in the Indian Ocean. It is capable of diving down to a depth of 6,000 m. First uncrewed trial was conducted on 27 October 2021 where the &#x27;personnel sphere&#x27; was lowered to a depth of 600 m, off the coast of Chennai.

=== &quot;Titan&quot; ===
; &quot;Titan&quot;
Titan, previously called Cyclops 2, was an experimental submersible that imploded while transporting tourists to visit the wreckage of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 2023. The submersible was created and operated by OceanGate. It was the first privately-owned submersible with a claimed maximum depth of 4,000 m (13,000 ft), and the first completed crewed submersible with a hull constructed of titanium and carbon fiber composite materials.

After testing with dives to its maximum intended depth in 2018 and 2019, the original composite hull of &quot;Titan&quot; developed fatigue damage and was replaced by 2021. In that year, OceanGate began transporting paying customers to the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, completing several dives to the wreck site in 2021 and 2022.

On June 18, 2023, &quot;Titan&quot; imploded during a dive to the &quot;Titanic&quot;. All five occupants of the submersible were killed. OceanGate had lost contact with &quot;Titan&quot; and contacted authorities later that day after the submersible was overdue for return. A massive international search and rescue operation ensued and ended on June 22, when debris from &quot;Titan&quot; was discovered about 1,600 feet (500 metres) from the bow of the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

===Other DSV bathyscaphes===
; Bathyscaphe &quot;Archimède&quot; : French-made bathyscaphe, operated around the time of the &quot;Trieste&quot;.

<doc id="1097536" wikidata="Q6383559" url="?curid=1097536" title="Keian Uprising">
<text>The was a failed coup d&#x27;état attempt carried out against the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan in 1651, by a number of &quot;rōnin&quot;. Though it failed, the event is historically significant as an indication of a wider problem of disgruntled rōnin throughout the country at the time. Masterminded by Yui Shōsetsu and Marubashi Chūya, the uprising is named after the Keian era in which it took place.

According to strategist Yui&#x27;s plan, Marubashi would take Edo Castle, the headquarters of the shogunate, using barrels of gunpowder to begin a fire which would rage through Edo, the capital. In the confusion, with the authorities distracted by firefighting efforts, the rōnin would storm the castle and kill key high officials. 

At the same time, Yui would lead a second group and seize the Tokugawa stronghold in Sunpu (modern-day city of Shizuoka). Further action was planned for Osaka Castle and Kyoto. They timed their rebellion to take advantage of the death of &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu, as his successor, Ietsuna, was still a child. The conspirators aimed to force the shogunate to relax its policies of seizing &quot;hans&quot; and dispossessing &quot;daimyōs&quot;, which under Iemitsu had deprived tens of thousands of samurai of position and income, adding them to the ranks of &quot;rōnin&quot;. 

Ultimately, however, the uprising failed when the conspirators&#x27; plan was discovered. Marubashi Chūya fell ill, and, talking through his fever dreams, revealed secrets which made their way to the authorities by the time the rebels were ready to move. Marubashi was arrested and executed in Edo; Yui Shōsetsu escaped that fate by committing &quot;seppuku&quot;, in Sunpu, upon finding himself surrounded by police. Several of the rebels committed suicide alongside him. The families of the conspirators as well were then tortured and killed by the authorities, as was usual at the time; several were crucified.

In the aftermath of the suppression of the uprising, the shogunal Elders (&quot;Rōjū&quot;) met to discuss the origins of the uprising, and how to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. Originally, most of the Elders sought to take severe measures, including expelling all rōnin from the city, but they were eventually convinced by Abe Tadaaki to take a more rational tack. He suggested reducing the number of rōnin opposed to the shogunate, not through expulsion, but by introducing more favorable policies. In particular, he convinced the council that the shogunate ought to do away with the law of escheatment, and to work to help &quot;rōnin&quot; settle into proper jobs. Forcefully expelling a great number of people from the city, he argued, would only serve to create more opposition to the government.

Far from being an isolated incident, the Keian Uprising was followed by an event the following year involving several hundred &quot;rōnin&quot;, and another soon afterwards in Sado. These were not directly related, that is, none of the persons involved were the same, nor did they follow a single leader or organized ideology. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, it is significant to note how widespread the distaste for the shogunate was at this time, and the degree of the &quot;problem&quot; of the &quot;rōnin&quot; throughout the country.

The tale was then retold in a novel, &quot;Keian Taiheiki&quot; (慶安太平記), and in a number of Kabuki plays, the most famous of which, also called &quot;Keian Taiheiki&quot;, was written by renowned playwright Kawatake Mokuami.

<text>David Alexander De Horne Rowntree (born 8 May 1964) is an English musician, politician, solicitor, composer and animator. He is best known as the drummer for the rock band Blur.

In his political career, Rowntree served on the Norfolk County Council from 2017 to 2021 representing the Labour Party, and unsuccessfully stood for Parliament as a Labour candidate in the 2010 and 2024 general elections.

==Early life==
David Alexander De Horne Rowntree was born in Colchester, Essex, at Colchester Maternity Hospital on 8 May 1964, to musical parents – Susan, a viola player, and John, a sound engineer at the BBC. He has an elder sister named Sara. He attended The Gilberd School in Colchester during the week, and the Landermere Music School, Thorpe-le-Soken, at weekends, where he studied percussion. He played percussion with his father in the Colchester Silver Band, a brass band. After leaving school he studied for a Higher National Diploma (HND) in Computer Science at Thames Polytechnic, and started his career as a computer programmer for Colchester Borough Council.

==Music career==

===Blur===

Rowntree played in bands with Graham Coxon while they were growing up in Colchester. He also knew Coxon&#x27;s father, who taught jazz classes at Landermere. In 1989, Coxon introduced Rowntree to Damon Albarn, who was forming a band around Goldsmiths, University of London. Rowntree was asked to join and left his job to move to London. With the addition of Alex James, and after two name changes, the band settled on Blur and were signed to Food Records, which was distributed through EMI. EMI later acquired Food Records and Blur were absorbed into EMI.

===Beagle 2 Mars mission===
In 1998 Rowntree&#x27;s life-long fascination with space led him to get involved in the Beagle 2 Mars mission. The previous year the European Space Agency (ESA) had announced its first planetary mission, an orbiter named the Mars Express. The Open University&#x27;s Prof Colin Pillinger proposed it should carry a lander dedicated to looking for life and conducting scientific analyses.

Rowntree and fellow band member Alex James became involved after taking a behind the scenes tour at Houston&#x27;s NASA space centre. They were struck by how many of the people they met there were British and wondered why they had to go to America to do space research and work in the industry. When they got back to the UK, they came across Beagle 2 while looking for UK space projects and pledged to support it. At that time, the cost of the lander project was estimated at £25 million and did not have wide support.

Rowntree and James joined the Beagle 2 team in 1998 to help with PR. They used their platform to help promote the project. Their support attracted high-profile support from the artist Damien Hirst and industry and financial backers. And after years of lobbying, the UK Government and ESA agreed to help finance the project. The Mars Express mission, carrying Beagle 2, was launched in June 2003. It carried a signature tune written by Blur to be beamed back from Mars to announce the lander&#x27;s arrival and one of Hirst&#x27;s trademark spot paintings to be used for the calibration of Beagle 2&#x27;s cameras. The Beagle 2 lost contact with earth but was spotted on Mars&#x27; surface ten years later by the UK Space Agency in images taken by a NASA orbiter.

Rowntree says: &quot;In the same way that Damien Hirst got the first artwork on Mars, we got the first music on Mars.&quot;

===XFM radio===
In 2014 Rowntree started as a presenter for Global Radio&#x27;s alternative rock radio station XFM (now Radio X) with a regular show on Sunday nights.

On his first show he played songs by John Lennon, Elbow and The Polyphonic Spree, interspersed with discussions with his studio friend, &quot;researcher George&quot;, on &quot;nerdy&quot; topics like Mars.

===Video===
On 31 July 2018, Rowntree appeared in the video for Slaves&#x27; released single, &quot;Chokehold&quot;, as a drummer auditioning for a part in the band.

===Podcast===
Rowntree hosts &quot;The Dave Rowntree Podcast Show&quot; on Spotify with &quot;researcher George&quot;. The first series was six episodes long, starting with an episode of Rowntree&#x27;s &quot;go to&quot; music for challenging times released in November 2020.

===Solo career===
In November 2021, Rowntree signed a deal with Cooking Vinyl for his first solo record. In a statement, Rowntree said, &quot;As a kid I used to spend hours spinning the dial on my radio, dreaming of escape to all the places whose exotic stations I heard. I&#x27;ve tried to make an album like that – tuning through the spectrum, stopping at each song telling a story about a turning point in my life, then spinning the dial and moving on.&quot;

His first solo single, &quot;London Bridge&quot;, was released on 5 July 2022.

Rowntree&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Radio Songs&quot;, was released on 20 January 2023.

==Film and animation==
===Animation===
Rowntree is a computer animator and owned an animation company called Nanomation for eleven years. Clients included advertising agencies and &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;. He also directed two series of the &quot;South Park&quot;-esque animated show &quot;Empire Square&quot;, which made its TV debut on Channel 4 on 18 February 2005.

===Non-photorealistic rendering===
Rowntree has an interest in computer graphics and has contributed to three research papers on topics related to non-photorealistic rendering. The papers look at translating video to animation using novel techniques to track and visualise movement.

===Film and television===
Rowntree also works in film and TV soundtrack composition. He and Ian Arber composed the music and score for the 2018 Bros documentary &quot;&quot;. He also worked on the BBC series &quot;The Capture&quot;, which premiered in 2019 and Netflix&#x27;s science fiction series &quot;The One&quot; (March 2021).

==Legal and political career==
===Law===
Rowntree trained to become a solicitor when Blur took a hiatus in 2006. He worked in the criminal department of London law firm Kingsley Napley, a firm of solicitors based in Moorgate, London.

In July 2017, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in law by Greenwich University, becoming an Honorary Doctor of Laws (HonLLD).

===Labour candidate and councillor===
Rowntree has been a keen activist and supporter of the Labour Party since becoming a member in 2002, and has been chair of London&#x27;s West End branch. In April 2007, he unsuccessfully contested the safe Conservative seat of Marylebone High Street on Westminster City Council. In July 2008, he fought the Labour-held seat of Church Street, but was unsuccessful again.

In February 2008, he was selected by the Cities of London and Westminster Constituency Labour Party to stand against the incumbent Conservative MP Mark Field at the 2010 general election; Rowntree was defeated at that election. In 2011, he sought selection as the Labour candidate for Norwich South, but lost to Clive Lewis, a journalist and former soldier, who went on to be elected as the constituency&#x27;s MP.

In the Norfolk County Council election on 4 May 2017, Rowntree was elected as county councillor for the University ward in Norwich. He stood down before the 2021 election, due to the COVID-19 pandemic: in a statement on his website, he said &quot;It has been a joy and a privilege to represent the residents in University Ward, and I&#x27;ve made friendships here that will last a lifetime. I hope that when this is all over, I can get back involved somehow.&quot;

In March 2024, Rowntree was selected as Labour&#x27;s prospective parliamentary candidate for the constituency of Mid Sussex in the 2024 general election. The seat is presently held by the Liberal Democrat MP Alison Bennett. Rowntree&#x27;s campaign focused on housing and town centre regeneration.

===Political views===
Rowntree is a committed opponent of the death penalty and patron of Amicus, an organisation that provides legal representation to people on death row in the United States.

In August 2014, Rowntree was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

===Campaigns===
Rowntree has campaigned against prosecution of internet music filesharers. He is a member of the Advisory Council of the Open Rights Group, a United Kingdom-based digital rights NGO. When asked on Blur&#x27;s website how he felt about their single &quot;Out of Time&quot; being leaked on the internet before its release, he replied &quot;I&#x27;d rather it gushed&quot;.

Rowntree is a founding director of the Featured Artists Coalition.

In May 2016, he organised a celebrity &quot;Star Boot Sale&quot; to raise funds for mobile health clinics to help Syrian refugees and host Jordanians in need. Stars manning the stalls included Hot Chip, Melanie C, KT Tunstall and Badly Drawn Boy, with Phil Daniels as auctioneer for special lots, like Kylie Minogue&#x27;s handbag.

==Other interests==
Rowntree obtained a full pilot&#x27;s licence in 1995. He has held a foundation licence for amateur radio in the UK since 2012, upgrading to a full licence in 2016. His callsign is M0IEG.

==Personal life==
In 1994, Rowntree married Paola Marra, a Canadian woman. They divorced in the early 2000s. In 2007, he was dating Michelle de Vries.

In the early 1990s, Rowntree was a heavy drinker. He stopped drinking alcohol in 1993 after a particularly heavy drinking session with members of the band Siouxsie and the Banshees. However, several years later, he began a cocaine habit. This led to a public incident in 2003 when, during a TV interview of Blur for MuchMusic by Canadian journalist Nardwuar the Human Serviette, Rowntree was seen mocking and physically intimidating Nardwuar throughout the interview. Rowntree has apologised several times since for his behaviour, saying that &quot;the day after a cocaine binge I&#x27;d sometimes fly into a murderous rage, and that this was the case on that day&quot;. Nardwuar accepted Rowntree&#x27;s apology on Twitter. By 2007, Rowntree stated that he had stopped using drugs and was &quot;active in the recovery community&quot;. He keeps a clip of the interview on his phone, to watch if he ever considers relapsing into drug use. Nardwuar later said of Rowntree&#x27;s apology &quot;It&#x27;s so nice of him. I love the fact that someone is using my interview for motivational purposes.&quot;

Rowntree is a trustee on the board of Release, a charity that campaigns for evidence-based drug policies founded on principles of public health.

<doc id="1097542" wikidata="Q1262698" url="?curid=1097542" title="Duane Peters">
<text>Duane Thomas Peters (born June 12, 1961) is a punk rock singer/songwriter and professional skateboarder. Active since 1975, he is probably best known as the singer in the California punk rock band U.S. Bombs, which formed in 1993.

==Biography==
Peters is credited for popularizing, or in his words &quot;inventing&quot; many tricks, such as the &quot;acid drop&quot; into a pool/bowl, the &quot;layback grind&quot;, the &quot;Indy air&quot;, the &quot;Sweeper&quot;, the &quot;backside layback grind revert&quot;, the &quot;fakie hang-up&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Disaster&quot;), the &quot;invert revert&quot;, the &quot;fakie thruster&quot;, and the &quot;loop of death&quot;, a full 360-degree rotation in a specially designed loop. He also, along with Neil Blender, helped to evolve the footplant into the more dynamic fastplant.

Peters was named &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Legend&quot; in 2003. He is a professional skateboarder who rides for Pocket Pistols Skates. In May 2005, Black Label Skateboards released a biographic film, entitled &quot;Who Cares: The Duane Peters Story&quot;. A second documentary, planned by HavocTV, and intended to focus on the supposed path to sobriety of Peters girlfriend Corey Parks, was publicized but failed to appear. In 2006, a sober Peters had a cameo in the Joan Jett video &quot;Androgynous&quot;, directed by Morgan Higby Night.

Along with skateboarding, Peters is a well-known punk rock singer. He has formed bands such as the US Bombs, Political Crap, Die&#x27; Hunns (also known as Duane Peters and The Hunns), Duane Peters Gunfight, and Exploding Fuckdolls. He was formerly connected with two defunct record labels: Disaster Records, (owned by Patrick Boissel of Alive Records), and – later – Indian Recordings (owned by Ponk Media).

In 2000, Peters formed Duane Peters and The Hunns with Rob Milucky (previously of The Grabbers and The Pushers). Within two years, the band released three albums and undertook both national and European tours. At a The Damned show in 2002, Peters met Corey Parks, who had just left her previous band, Nashville Pussy. Parks joined Duane Peters and the Hunns on bass guitar and soon the band changed their name to Die Hunns. Die Hunns recorded a fourth album entitled &quot;Long Legs, Die&#x27; Hunns&quot;, and embarked on another tour.

==Personal life==
Peters&#x27; 20-year-old son, Chess Peters, was killed in a car accident on July 6, 2007.

In February 2014, Peters was charged with assaulting his girlfriend at their home in Long Beach, California. He was sentenced to five years probation after pleading guilty to the charge, and also ordered to attend a domestic violence counseling program, 60 days of community serviced and to stay away from the victim for 10 years.

<text>The indigenous peoples of Brunei are Bruneian people who belong to the ethnic groups considered indigenous to the country. It is more commonly attributed to indigenous people of the Malay race belonging to the seven ethnic groups, namely: Brunei, Tutong, Belait, Dusun, Murut, Kedayan and Bisaya. The local term  refers to citizens of indigenous descent, in particular the aforementioned seven ethnic groups. The term has also been sometimes used to refer to the indigenous peoples.

== Definition ==
According to the Brunei Nationality Act, the indigenous people of Brunei are mainly classified into Malays and non-Malays. Indigenous Malays comprise the following ethnic groups:

* Brunei
* Tutong
* Belait
* Dusun
* Murut
* Kedayan
* Bisaya

Meanwhile the indigenous people other than the Malays are defined in the First Schedule of the Act to comprise the following ethnic groups:

* Bukitans
* Dayaks (sea)
* Dayaks (land)
* Kelabits
* Kayans
* Kenyahs (including Sabups and Sipengs)
* Kajangs (including Sekapans, Kejamans, Lahanans, Punans, Tanjongs and Kanowits)
* Lugats
* Lisums
* Melanaus
* Penans
* Sians
* Tagals
* Tabuns
* Ukits
== Precedence ==
Being accorded the status of (&#x27;indigenous citizens&#x27;) in Brunei carries with it certain benefits and opportunities which other non-indigenous citizens may not have access to. (translates as &quot;Landless Indigenous Citizens&#x27; Scheme&quot;) is a public housing scheme which allows the people to acquire land and home in the allocated public housing estates. The Royal Brunei Armed Forces primarily employ the indigenous Malays. In the Brunei Constitution, the government ministers and deputy ministers must be of &quot;the Malay race professing the Islamic Religion, save where His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan otherwise decides.&quot;

== Concerns ==
The justification for these special privileges and affirmative action schemes is that the or the indigenous people face disadvantages due to the success of other groups in society, for example the Chinese. One case of such disadvantage can be seen in the demise of the construction industry in Brunei. The building sector is a major employer of Bumiputeras and forms the lifeblood of many Bumiputera families.

According to Minority Rights Group International, the non-Muslim indigenous people are continuously &quot;banned&quot; from conducting non-Islamic religious activities, and &quot;pressured&quot; and &quot;incentivized&quot; to convert to Islam. It also claimed that the government policy and legislation discourage indigenous cultures and languages.

There is a lack of &quot;opposition&quot; to the concept in Brunei due to the country being an autocratic sultanate and the lack of political diversity.

<doc id="1097545" wikidata="Q1048348" url="?curid=1097545" title="Miracle (Celine Dion album)">
<text>Miracle is the twenty-first studio album and ninth English-language album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Sony Music on 11 October 2004. It is a concept album credited to Dion and Australian photographer Anne Geddes. The songs were produced by David Foster. &quot;Miracle&quot; topped the chart in Canada and Wallonia (Belgium) and reached top five in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands. It was certified Platinum in the US and Canada, and Gold in various countries.

==Content and release==
&quot;Miracle&quot; is a part of a CD-and-book multimedia collection, with Dion&#x27;s music providing the soundtrack to Geddes&#x27;s pictorial book celebrating the joy of babies. The songs were produced by David Foster, who had not worked with Dion since 1999.

Among tracks on the album are cover versions of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;, Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, Roberta Flack&#x27;s &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, Johannes Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Brahms&#x27; Lullaby&quot;, Nancy Wilson&#x27;s &quot;If I Could&quot;, Henri Salvador&#x27;s &quot;Le loup, la biche et le chevalier (une chanson douce)&quot;, and Carol Welsman&#x27;s &quot;Baby Close Your Eyes&quot;.

All other tracks are original songs such as the title track, which was written in 2001 for &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; to celebrate the birth of Dion&#x27;s son René-Charles, but the song was never published on that album.

Some tracks were previously released on Dion&#x27;s albums, including &quot;Brahms&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; on &quot;These Are Special Times&quot; and &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; on &quot;All the Way... A Decade of Song&quot;. Live performances of &quot;If I Could&quot; and &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; were available on &quot;A New Day... Live in Las Vegas&quot;. &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Prayer&quot; is a solo version of &quot;The Prayer&quot;, a duet with Andrea Bocelli from &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;. &quot;Le loup, la biche et le chevalier (une chanson douce)&quot; was performed live by Dion and Henri Salvador in October 2003, during the taping of &quot;1 fille &amp; 4 types&quot; TV special. However, this duet version was not included on any album.

&quot;Miracle&quot; was released in three different formats: CD; CD/DVD plus 60-page booklet; and plus CD/DVD. &quot;Je lui dirai&quot;, available previously on &quot;1 fille &amp; 4 types&quot;, was included as a bonus track in Francophone countries.

==Singles==
&quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; was released as the first single in North America and some parts of Europe. It was followed by &quot;In Some Small Way&quot; in the United States and Canada. &quot;Je lui dirai&quot; was released as a single in Francophone countries, while the title track was issued as a single in the United Kingdom and parts of Asia. All these songs were released as radio singles without accompanying music videos.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Miracle&quot; was met with mixed reviews. AllMusic said that &quot;it&#x27;s the quietest record Dion has recorded in a while, an unabashed adult contemporary album that keeps its gentle mood from start to finish, as if it were a prolonged lullaby. Dion tempers her vocal histrionics considerably — she still soars to the high notes, but there are no pyrotechnics, no showboating here — which serves this collection of standards and new songs quite well&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Miracle&quot; debuted inside top 10 in many countries, reaching number one in Canada, Belgium Wallonia. It debuted at number four in the United States with 107,000 copies sold. It also debuted in the fourth position in France and the Netherlands, number five in the United Kingdom, number six in Switzerland and number 9 in Greece. &quot;Miracle&quot; set a record in the United States, spending 18 consecutive weeks at the top position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Kid Audio chart.

It was certified Platinum in the United States and Canada, and Gold in the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Belgium. Three months after its release, the &quot;Miracle&quot; CD has sold more than two million copies worldwide. The book/CD/DVD package has also been successful, reaching 500,000 copies sold.

==Accolades==

At the Juno Awards of 2005, &quot;Miracle&quot; was nominated in two categories, including Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year. Dion was also nominated for the Juno Award for Artist of the Year. &quot;Miracle&quot; was also nominated for the Félix Award in category Anglophone Album of the Year.

<doc id="1097549" wikidata="Q1085312" url="?curid=1097549" title="Live at Blues Alley">
<text>Live at Blues Alley is an album by American singer Eva Cassidy, originally self-released in May 1996. The album was recorded live at the Blues Alley nightclub in January 1996. It was the last album recorded by Cassidy before her death in November 1996.

==Recording details==

Unable to interest a major label in recording her music, Cassidy cashed in a small pension she had accumulated while working at her day job in a plant nursery to self-fund this recording of herself and her live band, comprising Lenny Williams (piano), Keith Grimes (guitar), Chris Biondo (bass) and Raice McLeod (drums), with Cassidy herself supplying vocals and acoustic guitar. The Blues Alley venue was booked for two nights, January 2 and 3, 1996, however on the first night technical issues prevented the tapes being any use so all of the recorded material used originates from the second, Wednesday night&#x27;s performance. Cassidy was suffering from a light cold through both shows and initially felt that the performances were not good enough to release, but eventually agreed after a previously completed studio take of &quot;Oh, Had I a Golden Thread&quot; was added to round out the package.

This was Cassidy&#x27;s last release in her lifetime, but the beginning of her posthumous rise to fame. She died of melanoma six months after it was released, ten months after it was recorded.

Video recordings of a number of the same performances, virtually the sum of her recorded video legacy, were later released on DVD as &quot;Eva Cassidy Sings&quot;, and again (with slightly different track selection) on the DVD portion of the 2-CD + 1-DVD 2015 compilation &quot;Nightbird&quot;, of which the audio CDs include remixed versions of the songs from &quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot; as well as 19 additional tracks from the same concert, a subset of which had previously also been included on other posthumous Cassidy releases.

==Music==
&quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot; serves as an example of Cassidy&#x27;s eclectic tastes, covering classic and contemporary artists from Billie Holiday to Sting, including Al Green, Pete Seeger, Irving Berlin and more. Her cover of &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; was a popular radio song and record companies used it to promote her material; in 2001 Michelle Kwan skated to the music of Eva&#x27;s version of this song. &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, the last song she ever performed live, retains one of the introductions that was not edited out, in which she dedicates the song to her parents. &quot;Golden Thread&quot;, by Pete Seeger, was declared by Eva to be her favorite song in the album&#x27;s liner notes and the song she felt had turned out the best on the album. It was not actually performed at Blues Alley but was recorded months earlier.

==Reception==

The album inspired attention from audiences outside of her local following in Washington D.C. Before and during the album&#x27;s recording, Cassidy suffered many physical health problems, whose causes, at the time, were unknown. Three months after the album was released, she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Unfortunately, she died three months later without experiencing her burgeoning musical career. &quot;Her posthumous success,&quot; writes William Cooper, &quot;has been astonishing, with worldwide critical acclaim and extensive exposure on British television that helped her album &quot;Songbird&quot; climb to number one on the British album chart in March, 2001.&quot;

<text>Género chico (literally, &quot;little genre&quot;) is a Spanish genre of short, light plays with music. It is a major branch of &quot;zarzuela&quot;, Spain&#x27;s form of popular music theatre with dialogue, and differs from &quot;zarzuela grande&quot; and most other operatic forms both in its brevity and by being aimed at audiences of a wide social spectrum.

== Origin and development ==
===Historical context===
&quot;Zarzuela&quot; was developed during the reign of Philip IV (1605–1665, reigned from 1621), who during the 1640s began to commission musico-theatrical entertainments on mythological themes mixed with popular peasant song and dance, from the writer Calderón de la Barca working with composers such as Juan de Hidalgo. These were performed at the Royal hunting lodge, the &quot;Palacio de la Zarzuela&quot;. During the next two hundred years, &quot;zarzuela&quot;, as these mixed entertainments swiftly became known, became the native-language alternative to the Italian operatic form nurtured by successive monarchs.

In the 19th century, the country&#x27;s tense political circumstances affected &quot;zarzuela&quot;. Isabella II fell from power during the liberal revolution of 1868, and the country found itself submerged in a crisis at all levels: economic, political, and ideological (with various strands of socialism coming to prominence). Instability increased with the 1870 assassination of Juan Prim, President of the regency council and Marshal of Spain. For economic and other reasons, there was a sharp drop in theatre box-office sales, as most people could not afford the average fourteen &quot;reales&quot; for non-necessities. Such high prices, plus the national uncertainty, brought most Madrid theatres into crisis, and many - including the &quot;Teatro de la Zarzuela&quot; itself - came close to ruin.

===The beginning===
Against this trend, Juan José Luján, Antonio Riquelme and José Vallés, three actors, had the idea of splitting the afternoon at the theatre into four parts of one hour each, creating the so-called &quot;sesiones por horas&quot;, or &quot;performances by the hour&quot;, which cost barely a &quot;real&quot;, and were given in down-market theatres. This kept the seats filled, since people came more often, due to low prices. Managers accepted the idea, needing customers.

They wanted to repeat the success of &quot;teatro cómico&quot;, an earlier phenomenon that copied Offenbach&#x27;s comic model, and was brought by the theatre manager Arderíus to the Madrid Variety Theatre (with his own &quot;El Joven Telémaco&quot; — &quot;Young Telemachus&quot; — as the main draw). The comedic model for these featured zany, unpredictable plots based on myths, tending towards caricature and mockery of various topics such as royalty, the Army, and politics. They do so with pleasant, catchy music with a certain popular, erotic tone. Comic operas of this sort were nevertheless quickly eclipsed by the expansion of the &quot;género chico&quot; and became less popular after the mid-1870s.

Because of the need for short operetta-like works that could fit into one hour, the first performances were of old plays that were already popular, such as &quot;El Maestro de baile&quot; (&quot;The Dancing Master&quot;, by Luis Misón, and predating the &quot;género chico&quot; by many years), or plays like &quot;Una vieja&quot; (&quot;An Old Woman&quot;, Joaquín Gaztambide) and &quot;El grumete&quot; (&quot;The Cabin Boy&quot;, Emilio Arrieta). These plays had originally been considered secondary and were programmed as such, beside larger, more important &quot;zarzuelas&quot;, but with a change of taste and the tendency towards nationalism and German opera, the Italian taste copied by the &quot;zarzuelas&quot; would fall out of fashion, whilst the character of these little plays shone for itself. With time, new short plays were written for this short format and jolly style, notably influenced by the comic genre (with suggestive titles such as &quot;La hoja de parra&quot; (&quot;The Fig Leaf&quot;) or &quot;Dice el sexto mandamiento&quot; (&quot;According to the Sixth Commandment&quot;).

It is easy to see that the goal of &quot;género chico&quot; is purely to entertain the audience. Unlike the serious, dramatic themes and complicated plots in &quot;zarzuela mayor&quot;, this genre presented simplified farces about everyday topics such as daily life in Madrid. This is why it was so successful with the public: apart from the low price, people could easily follow the plot and identify with the characters.

===Development===
The decade of the 1870s saw the genre consolidate itself, with numerous authors publishing, for example Miguel Nieto and his &quot;El Gorro Frigio&quot; (&quot;The Phrygian Cap&quot;), and Fernández Caballero&#x27;s &quot;Château Margaux&quot;. The genre was now centred on a model similar to that of contemporary realist literature, mainly with the musical form of lyrical one-act farces.

The definitive accolade that the &quot;género chico&quot; would receive was with Chueca and Valverde&#x27;s &quot;La Gran Vía&quot;, in the summer of 1886. The play, named after a major street that was then under construction through the heart of Madrid, was so successful that it went from the summer theatres to the Apolo, and was repeated several times. It incorporated a series of lively, unrelated one-act farces on current affairs. Federico Chueca was one of the most prolific and important &quot;chico&quot; composer-librettists, often collaborating with Joaquín Valverde Durán. His work includes &quot;El año pasado por agua&quot; (&quot;Last Year Under Water&quot;), &quot;Agua, azucarillos y aguardiente&quot; (&quot;Water, Sweets, and Spirits&quot;), perhaps the most popular nowadays, &quot;La alegría de la huerta&quot; (&quot;The happiness of the orchard&quot;), &quot;El arca de Noé&quot; (&quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;), &quot;Los descamisados&quot; (&quot;The Shirtless Ones&quot;) and more.

Another common model for these works was comparison of two places: &quot;De Madrid a París&quot; (Chueca y Velarde, &quot;From Madrid to Paris&quot;) or &quot;De Getafe al paraíso&quot; (&quot;From Getafe to Paradise&quot;, a two-act &quot;zarzuela&quot; by Barbieri, Getafe is a town close to Madrid), &quot;Cádiz&quot; (Valverde). Other important playwrights were Giménez, Joaquín &quot;Quinito&quot; Valverde Sanjuán (Joaquín Valverde Durán&#x27;s son), Tomás Lopez Torregrosa (&quot;San Antón&quot; and &quot;El santo de la Isidra&quot; [&quot;Isidra&#x27;s Saint&quot;, Isidra being one of the characters]) Fernández Caballero (&quot;El dúo de la africana&quot; [The Duet from &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, a reference to the opera by Meyerbeer], &quot;El cabo primero&quot; [&quot;The Headman&quot;, that is, the person in command], &quot;La viejecita&quot; [&quot;The Little Old Lady&quot;], and &quot;Gigantes y cabezudos&quot; [&quot;Giants and &quot;cabezudos&quot;&quot;]; named after popular Spanish parade disguises), Jerónimo Jiménez (&quot;El baile de Luis Alonso&quot; [&quot;The Dance of Luis Alonso&quot;] and its sequel &quot;La boda de Luis Alonso&quot; [&quot;The Marriage of Luis Alonso&quot;]).

One very important &quot;auteur&quot; was Ruperto Chapí, who spent his life oscillating between attempts to create a proper Spanish opera, and his modest &quot;género chico&quot; plays, which included &quot;Música Clásica&quot; (&quot;Classical Music&quot;), &quot;La revoltosa&quot; (&quot;The Rebel Girl&quot;), &quot;¡Las doce y media y sereno!&quot; (&quot;Half Past Midnight and all is quiet&quot;), y &quot;El tambor de granaderos&quot; (&quot;The Grenadiers&#x27; Drum&quot;).

Finally, one of the best-known examples of &quot;género chico&quot; was &quot;La verbena de la Paloma&quot; (&quot;The Fair of the Dove&quot;, set at a &quot;verbena&quot; on the night of the Virgin of the Paloma, August 14) ;, by composer Tomás Bretón. This popular piece came about following several years of experiments by its creator.

The &quot;género chico&quot; was to decline in importance with the turn of the 19th century.

== Performance venues ==
The idea of performances by the hour began in cheap theatres, the &quot;Teatro del Recreo&quot; being the first. Whilst the critics were harsh with the genre, it was a great success with the public and was adopted by a few more theatres, to the point where it took over the Variedades theater, which the decline of comic opera had left free, and which was already a venue of some note. But the most important venue associated with the &quot;género chico&quot; is the Teatro Apolo, opened in 1873, which, following the crisis in &quot;zarzuela grande&quot;, began to put on &quot;género chico&quot;, to overwhelming popular success.

The Apolo was considered the real bastion of the genre, and very famous because of the popularity of its fourth session, &quot;la cuarta de Apolo&quot;, which was a night-time performance and was always full of dodgy characters, rogues and tricksters no different from the villains represented on stage.
Outside of the theatres, the &quot;género chico&quot; was also performed in small cafés, and during the summer cheap stages were set up for plays. Indeed, the arguably most important play in the genre, &quot;La Gran Vía&quot;, was performed in this way.

== Lyrical farce as form of &quot;género chico&quot; ==
The main model for &quot;género chico&quot; is the &quot;sainete lírico&quot; or one-act lyrical farce, thanks to the successful &quot;La canción de la Lola&quot; (&quot;Lola&#x27;s Song&quot;) by Chueca and Valverde, in 1880. Although other genres are also utilised, the most important plays follow this model. The &quot;sainete&quot;, established in its definitive form by Ramón de la Cruz, is the direct heir of the comic interludes or brief farces that were previously so popular. These are essentially short, independent pieces, with music and often dance. The &quot;género chico&quot; evolved from this form towards a relatively faithful portrait of everyday Madrid life, in keeping with the abovementioned Realism. However, unlike Realism, which lingers on the darker and murkier aspects of reality, such as poor, marginal sections of society and the violence running through them, the &quot;género chico&quot;, whilst dealing with low-class neighbourhoods and uneducated people, concentrated on the jollier, picturesque aspects of Madrid, such as the dialect of the characters, and their most jovial facets.

Moreover, as a unique characteristic of the genre, the constant presence of open-air parties, often at night, which appear at the beginning of the plays in order to situate them and at the end as &quot;dénouement&quot;.

===Libretto===
The plot is very simple, and sometimes barely holds up the play, which then relies on the scenes it creates. In the majority of cases, it consists of a simple love story with the same basic structure: a couple is in love but some outside difficulty prevents them from consummating their love (always, by marrying each other in a happy ending); this difficulty is overcome and the story ends with a public &quot;dénouement&quot;, a happy ending and an implicit or explicit moral (as well as asking the audience&#x27;s favour at the very end). Beside this structure, stereotyped characters from the Madrid scene are brought in (Madrid is typically the locale for these plays): the cheeky chappy, the colourful anarchist who avoids making provocative comments, the idler, the scrounger, the flirt, the sententious old geezer. There usually aren&#x27;t any educated characters; instead, popular folk wisdom is represented.

The &quot;género chico&quot; was always fiercely current: the actors make references (often in the songs, into which extra verses are added) to the outside world, with this &quot;news&quot; aspect of the play being even more important than the actual plot. There are mentions of politicians, external events and so forth, all as a way of connecting with an audience of humble culture. To this effect, the unity of what is going on in the play is broken, and the spectator is drawn in with the actors, without actually getting on stage.

The text is usually in prose, although some of the first plays alternate between parts in prose and in verse. Moreover, the language used is deliberately vulgar, with fashionable expressions and badly-pronounced foreign words and references. Jokes and other semantic aspects were not originally part of the &quot;sainete&quot;, but were subsequently incorporated by &quot;quinteros&quot;. The music was then justified by the text: people dancing in the street and suchlike. There is also theatre within theatre, as well as orchestra in the text. All these features aim fundamentally to create contact with the audience.

===Music===
There is disagreement regarding the relevance of the music itself. While some writers consider it always subordinate to the text in terms of importance, others such as Ramón Barce have theorised that the music comes first in the composition of the work; incoherent texts, called &quot;monstruos&quot; (&quot;monsters&quot;), merely gave the librettist a rhythm to which he must fit his words; these words were then often inexpertly fiddled with by the composer). In any case, the music does not usually correspond closely to the action, but rather is something in the background, sometimes coming in unexpectedly.

The musical part varies greatly in length, the plays with most music being &quot;Agua, azucarillos y aguardiente&quot; and &quot;La verbena de la paloma&quot;. Normally, the plays are preceded by a musical prelude, and occasionally have little intervals or music for dancing, and finish with a short finale in which the music from some previous scene is repeated. There are usually passages read over background music, in &quot;Singspiel&quot; style.

The music is familiar to the ear, popular and traditional, with popular or fashionable melodies of the time being taken and their lyrics changed. The aim is to have the ditty stick in the audience&#x27;s mind after they leave the theatre. Furthermore, pronounced, popular rhythms are sought in the dance halls, generally imported but &quot;nationalised&quot;, such as the &quot;chotis&quot; (from the German &quot;Schottisch&quot;, its ultimate origin being in Scotland), and many others, such as boleros, fandangos, or habaneras from Latin America, jotas, seguidillas, soleás, pasacalles, and waltzes, polkas, or mazurcas from Poland.

<doc id="1097587" wikidata="Q1180806" url="?curid=1097587" title="Dead Head (band)">
<text>Dead Head is a Dutch thrash metal band from the city Kampen. The band was formed in 1989 by the four original members Tom van Dijk (bass, vocals), Robbie Woning (guitar), Ronnie van der Wey (guitar), and Hans Spijker (drums). Their mission was to become the most intensive and brutal thrash metal band Europe ever had seen. They were influenced by classic thrash metal bands like Dark Angel, Kreator and Sadus.

They released their debut album in 1991, and have released seven studio albums and one 10 inch.

==History==

Dead Head were formed in 1989 and after releasing a number of demos, in 1990 they scored a record deal with the German company Rising Sun Records, who released Dead Head&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Feast Begins at Dawn&quot;, in 1991. After the recordings for the debut album Dead Head did a tour through Denmark with Edge of Sanity and Invocator, and played in Holland with Sepultura, Heathen, Skyclad, Candlemass, Suffocation, Sinister, Gorefest, Malevolent Creation and Grave.

Their original drummer Hans Spijker was replaced by Marco Kleinnibbelink in 1992. With their new drummer Dead Head started working on new material for their second album which resulted in the album &quot;Dream Deceiver&quot; in 1993. Before the release of that album Dead Head did a European tour with the band Massacra. During the tour Dead Head played with big names like Kreator and Biohazard in Belgium.
&quot;Kill Division&quot;, Dead Head&#x27;s third album was put together in the original line-up as they began in 1989. Altogether, this album represents the band&#x27;s roots more than anything, maybe except from playing live. The songs were recorded totally live.

It took a lot of time to write a sequel to &quot;Kill Division&quot;. However, with their fourth album, &quot;Haatland&quot;, the band did what they wanted to do: put out a straightforward aggressive thrash metal album that came from their hearts. The recording began in 2004 and the album was released in 2005 to critical acclaim.

The band began writing songs for new material in 2007 while doing only a few shows in the Netherlands. In 2008 they signed a record deal with the label Displeased Records. In April 2012 Dead Head announced the returning of the original frontman Tom van Dijk.

<doc id="1097591" wikidata="Q431641" url="?curid=1097591" title="Theodore McKeldin">
<text>Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin (November 20, 1900August 10, 1974) was an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, McKeldin served as mayor of Baltimore twice, from 1943 to 1947 and again from 1963 to 1967, and as Governor of Maryland from 1951 to 1959.

==Early life==
McKeldin was born in Baltimore as one of eleven children. His father had worked as a stonecutter and later was a Baltimore City police officer. McKeldin attended high school at Baltimore City College in the evenings while working as a bank clerk during the day. He later graduated from the University of Maryland Law School at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and was admitted to the Maryland bar.

Two years later, he began his political ascent when worked as a secretary to Mayor William F. Broening, one of few Republican mayors of the predominantly Democratic city. McKeldin also served as vice president of the local chapter of the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce. In 1934, he co-founded the charity Santa Claus Anonymous.

==Political career==
McKeldin challenged Democratic mayor of Baltimore Howard W. Jackson in the 1939 election, but was defeated. He subsequently challenged the incumbent governor of Maryland, Democrat Herbert R. O&#x27;Conor, in 1942, but lost by five points.

McKeldin would ultimately be elected mayor of Baltimore in 1943 on his second attempt. During his first term, he oversaw the construction of Friendship Airport, now Baltimore-Washington International Airport, in Anne Arundel County. McKeldin ran for governor again in 1946, challenging William Preston Lane Jr., but was defeated again by a wider margin than in 1942.

McKeldin ran for governor a third time in 1950, defeating Lane in a rematch. As governor, McKeldin endeavored to improve the state highway system by establishing the Baltimore Beltway (now Interstate 695), the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495), and the John Hanson Highway portion of U.S. Route 50. He was a staunch supporter of interstate cooperation, saying once: &quot;I rode by train over several state borders. I carried no passports. No one asked me to identify myself. No one had the right to. This is America.&quot; He was also an advocate for civil rights for African Americans, and received the Sidney Hollander Award for his pro-civil rights efforts. He was also a supporter of Israel.

In 1952, McKeldin was a major figure among moderate Republicans who campaigned for Dwight D. Eisenhower to receive the Republican nomination for President, and would deliver the principal nominating speech for Eisenhower at the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago.

In 1954, McKeldin was re-elected governor against president of the University of Maryland, College Park Harry C. &quot;Curley&quot; Byrd, who had controversially resisted desegregating the university. After his second term in Government House, McKeldin returned to his law practice in Baltimore; he was succeeded as Governor by Democrat J. Millard Tawes.

In 1963, McKeldin returned to public service after being narrowly elected to a second non-consecutive term as mayor of Baltimore. In his second term, his administration focused on the urban renewal of the city&#x27;s Inner Harbor. In 1964, he decided to support Democratic candidate Lyndon B. Johnson over Republican Barry M. Goldwater in the presidential election, due to Goldwater&#x27;s opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1966, the city council voted to condemn and demolish 700 homes in the Rosemont neighborhood to build the Interstate 170 &quot;highway to nowhere&quot; that McKeldin had conceived with urban planner Robert Moses in 1941. McKeldin&#x27;s second term as mayor ended in 1967, and he did not seek re-election.

McKeldin remains the last Republican mayor of Baltimore to date; indeed, he is the last Republican mayoral candidate to win even one-third of the vote in the city. He was the first Republican governor of Maryland to be re-elected, and the only one until Larry Hogan was re-elected in 2018.

==Personal life==
McKeldin married Honolulu Claire Manzer on October 17, 1924. They had two children.

McKeldin died on August 10, 1974, and is buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.

Five tracks (&quot;Wade in the Water&quot;, &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;, &quot;Songbird&quot;, &quot;Time is a Healer&quot; and &quot;I Know You by Heart&quot;) are from Cassidy&#x27;s album &quot;Eva by Heart&quot;. Four tracks (&quot;Fields of Gold&quot;, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, &quot;People Get Ready&quot; and &quot;Oh Had I a Golden Thread&quot;) are from her album &quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot;. The remaining track, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, is from the album &quot;The Other Side&quot;. The compilation album was certified Gold by the CRIA (50,000 units) in 2003. It was certified Gold by the RIAA in 2001 and Platinum in 2008 for shipments in excess of one million copies.

In 2018, a twentieth anniversary edition of the album was released, titled &quot;Songbird 20&quot;.

==Background==
In May 1996, Eva Cassidy released the live album &quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot;, which would be the last album released before her death six months later, at the age of 33. Near the end of Cassidy&#x27;s life, local folk singer Grace Griffith sent a copy of the album to Bill Straw, the head of her label, Blix Street Records.

&quot;It didn&#x27;t take a genius to figure it out,&quot; Straw told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;The moment I listened to that tape, I knew this was one of the best singers I&#x27;d ever heard.&quot;

Straw approached the Cassidy family to put together a new album. In 1998, a compilation of tracks from Cassidy&#x27;s three released recordings was assembled into what would become &quot;Songbird&quot;. This CD lingered in relative obscurity for two years until it was given airplay by Terry Wogan on his wide-reaching BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot;, following recommendation by his producer Paul Walters. The album sold 100,000 more copies in the following months. &quot;The New York Times&quot; spoke of her &quot;silken soprano voice with a wide and seemingly effortless range, unerring pitch and a gift for phrasing that at times was heart-stoppingly eloquent.&quot;

==Chart performance==
The album was originally released in 1998, eighteen months on from Cassidy&#x27;s death. At this point, she was virtually unknown in the United Kingdom, and &quot;Songbird&quot; only charted in the nether-regions of the UK Albums Chart. Two years after the album&#x27;s release, however, Cassidy&#x27;s music was brought to the attention of British audiences when her versions of &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; and &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; were played by Mike Harding and Terry Wogan on BBC Radio 2. Following an overwhelming response, a camcorder recording of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, taken at Blues Alley in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. by her friend Bryan McCulley, was shown on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Songbird&quot; climbed to the top of the UK Albums Chart. It ended up being the eighth-biggest-selling album of 2001, and it has subsequently been certified 6× Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and has worldwide sales in excess of 5 million copies.

The tracks from &quot;Live at Blues Alley&quot; sound like studio cuts because Cassidy&#x27;s stage patter and the audience applause have been removed.

<text>Time After Time is a studio album by American singer Eva Cassidy, released in 2000, four years after her death in 1996.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;the songs have been lovingly, painstakingly digitized and sequenced so as to create a coherent album of tender, touching acoustic folk and minimally orchestrated pop that spotlights Cassidy&#x27;s talent.&quot;

Arun Starkey, writing for &quot;Far Out&quot;, opined Cassidy&#x27;s version of &quot;Kathy&#x27;s Song&quot; could make a &quot;strong claim to be better than the original.&quot;

<doc id="1097614" wikidata="Q998400" url="?curid=1097614" title="Let Love Rule (Lenny Kravitz album)">
<text>Let Love Rule is the debut studio album of American rock musician Lenny Kravitz, released on September 6, 1989, by Virgin Records. Then-wife Lisa Bonet wrote the lyrics to &quot;Fear&quot; and co-wrote the lyrics on the song &quot;Rosemary&quot;; other than that the album is virtually a one-man Kravitz show, as he wrote and produced all the songs and played nearly all the instruments.

&quot;Let Love Rule&quot; reached number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while it peaked at number 56 on the UK Albums Chart. The album is also featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The video for the lead single &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; concluded that Kravitz is &quot;still a little raw and the lyrics ... are forgettable, but there are enough good ideas here—even if a few of them were borrowed wholesale from the Beatles—to make &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; a satisfying debut.&quot;

Jennings was active in the Pacific Basin Economic Council and attended a number of trade talks on behalf of farmers.

===Political career===


Jennings&#x27;s political career began in local government. In 1991 he was elected to the Tasman District Council and was chairperson of the council&#x27;s environmental and planning committee.

Jennings was a candidate to become the second Leader of ACT after Roger Douglas stepped down, but he lost the race to Douglas&#x27; preferred successor, Richard Prebble at the party&#x27;s 1996 annual general meeting.

Jennings was first elected to Parliament in the 1996 election, becoming a list MP, having stood in the electorate. After entering parliament he was ACT spokesperson for agriculture, local government, transport, business development and rural affairs. During his first term as an MP, he stood in the Taranaki-King Country by-election where he finished a close second to National Party candidate Shane Ardern by 984 votes.

Jennings was re-elected on the ACT Party list in 1999; however, he was ranked at 12th on the party list in 2002 and was not returned to parliament. During his time as a parliamentarian, Jennings was widely regarded as being on the rural-centric right wing of ACT.

<text>Eric Menyuk (born November 5, 1959) is an American attorney and former actor. He is best known for his brief appearances in the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; as the Traveler. He was originally considered for the role of the android Data, which was eventually given to Brent Spiner. After retiring from his acting career, he retrained to become an attorney and represents children with disabilities and specializes in children&#x27;s education rights.

==Acting career==
Menyuk was in the running to play the android character Data in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. A memo from John Pike to John Ferrard dated April 13, 1987, listed Menyuk as one of several actors who were in contention for the role, also including Mark Lindsay Chapman, Kevin Peter Hall, and Kelvin Han Yee. Brent Spiner was eventually chosen for the role over Menyuk.

He was subsequently cast in the role of the Traveler, first appearing in the first season in the episode &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot; and returning in the fourth-season episode &quot;Remember Me&quot; and season seven&#x27;s &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;. To portray the character, he had to undergo a three-hour make-up process on each day of shooting, including prosthetics applied to his face and to both hands to reduce the number of fingers shown. He later remarked that although he respected the work of Michael Westmore, he disliked the prosthetics on his hands and went out of his way during shooting to hide them. Following his appearances on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, he has appeared on the convention circuit, including &quot;Star Trek&quot;-themed cruises on Carnival Cruise Lines.

In 2024, he reprised the role of the Traveler in a voice cameo in &quot;The Devourer of All Things, Part I&quot; in &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; season 2.

==Personal life==
He is an attorney, having graduated from Loyola Law School, Los Angeles, in 1998 after he retired from film and television. He and his wife Laurie have a son and a daughter.

Due to his son&#x27;s special needs, he has moved into the field of law involving children&#x27;s education rights. He was admitted to the State Bar of California on July 12, 1998. He earned his undergraduate degree from Vassar College in 1981.

<doc id="1097624" wikidata="Q6890010" url="?curid=1097624" title="Moe Sihota">
<text>Munmohan Singh &quot;Moe&quot; Sihota (born February 18, 1955) is a former Canadian broadcaster and politician. He was the first Canadian of South Asian and Indian descent to be elected to provincial parliament.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Duncan, British Columbia and attended St. George&#x27;s Boys School, Vancouver, on scholarship. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in social work from the University of British Columbia in 1977, was awarded a scholarship to Warwick School of Economics in 1981, and earned a law degree from the University of Victoria in 1982. He was a social worker in White Rock from 1978 to 1979 and a lawyer in Esquimalt in 1984.

==Political career==
His political career began during his undergraduate years at the University of British Columbia serving as the Ombudsman for the UBC student society, the Alma Mater Society, as well as serving as an elected student representative on the UBC Board of Governors. He became President of the Young New Democrats in 1978 and also served as the President of Cowichan—Malahat—The Islands Federal NDP as well as being the campaign manager for Frank Mitchell and Jim Manly who were elected to the British Columbia Legislature and the House of Commons of Canada respectively. In 1984, Sihota was elected as an alderman for Esquimalt.

In 1986, Sihota ran as the NDP Candidate in the riding of Esquimalt-Port Renfrew to replace the retiring Mitchell. He held the seat easily and became the first Indo-Canadian to be elected to any federal or provincial riding.

In 1991, Sihota ran for and won re-election in the new riding of Esquimalt-Metchosin as part of an NDP landslide victory. Subsequently, he was named by Premier Mike Harcourt in his first cabinet, the Minister of Labour and Consumer Services as well as Minister Responsible for Constitutional Affairs, becoming the first Indian-Canadian cabinet minister in a province of Canada.

He continued to serve in several cabinet posts under the Harcourt New Democratic government as well as under the subsequent governments of Glen Clark and Dan Miller, but was forced to resign from cabinet several times.

During his career, he created 200 new provincial parks, extended workers&#x27; compensation coverage to farm workers, and changed BC logging practices. He also served on the board of directors of BC Hydro and Power Authority, the Insurance Corporation of BC, the Workers Compensation Board, and the BC Buildings Corporation.

==Controversy==

===BC Law Society misconduct===
Sihota resigned as Minister of Labour in 1995 after the Law Society of BC suspended his licence to practice for 18 months, due to finding him guilty of professional misconduct. He was reinstated to Cabinet in 1996, but resigned again in December of the same year due to new allegations of corruption, abuse of office, and conflict of interest. The new allegations were related to actions he performed while in office that benefited his friend and former Vancouver MP Herb Dhaliwal. In his memoirs, &quot;A Measure of Defiance&quot;, former BC Premier Mike Harcourt commented that &quot;Although the B.C. Law Society denied the allegation, the hint that the investigation of our outspoken environment minister was politically motivated was too strong to be dismissed that quickly. There was no public outcry over the incident and to most of his constituents, reporters and even political adversaries, Moe&#x27;s credibility did not suffer seriously.&quot;

===BC Hydro appointment===
In 1991, Sihota helped his friend Dhaliwal become appointed to the board of B.C. Hydro in 1991, after Dhaliwal provided Sihota with a substantial mortgage guarantee. The opposition BC Liberals then requested an investigation by Conflict Commissioner Ted Hughes. Hughes later found that Sihota had not been in a conflict of interest. However, Hughes also said at the time of the finding that had the new laws been in place during Dhaliwal&#x27;s appointment in 1991, Sihota would have been found to be in a conflict of interest.

===Limousine licences===
In 1996 Dhaliwal had applied to the Motor Carrier Commission for several licences related to a limousine company partly owned by Dhaliwal and run by Sihota&#x27;s cousin. It was later revealed by the former Commission chairman that Sihota had made repeated calls and wrote several letters to the commission in relation to Dhaliwal&#x27;s applications. Sihota again resigned from cabinet in 1996. A new investigation was started not by the Conflict of Interest Commissioner, but by fellow NDP party member and Glen Clark deputy minister Doug McArthur. Although McArthur found that Sihota had &quot;exercised poor judgment and bullied commission staff&quot;, he found that Sihota had not been in a conflict of interest. Glen Clark then reappointed Sihota back to cabinet in 1998.

==Post Glen Clark era==
After retiring from politics following the NDP&#x27;s defeat in the, 2001 provincial election, Sihota became a television host for The New VI (formerly A-Channel now CTV2) in Victoria. He left the station in 2004 when his phone-in show, &quot;VILand Voices,&quot; was cancelled due to re-organization. He currently provides political commentary for CBC Radio&#x27;s Early Edition Political Panel.

Since 2004, Sihota has pursued several business opportunities and is currently a part-owner and director of the Northern Bear Golf Club (Edmonton, AB), Four Points Sheraton (Victoria, BC) and Walton&#x27;s Lakefront Resort (Osoyoos, BC).

In 2012, Vancouver Magazine named Sihota as one of B.C&#x27;s 50 most influential citizens.

In 2012, Sihota received the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal for contributions to Canadian Society. 

In 2005, the Parvasi Awards were created to honour outstanding achievements by Canadian Punjabis. Mr. Sihota was the recipient of the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of being the first Indo-Canadian elected to a Canadian Legislature and the first Indo-Canadian ever to be appointed to a cabinet.

The 100 Year Journey Project chronicles the stories of the first 100 South Asians that impacted Canadian Society, chartered new territories and broke new ground. Sihota received the 2015 Pioneers and Navigators Award for his work in Politics and Public Policy.

After the election of the New Democratic Government in Alberta, Sihota joined Edmonton&#x27;s Canadian Strategy Group to provide political and policy advice to Alberta Corporations, Trade Unions and non-profits.

===BC NDP president===
In November 2009, Sihota was elected to the position of president of the BC New Democratic Party. In October 2010, the media revealed that Sihota was being paid a salary for his position as president, with payments from the Canadian Union of Public Employees, United Steelworkers, and the British Columbia Federation of Labour. Sihota was elected to a second term at the 2011 party convention.

Sihota, along with party leader Adrian Dix, faced criticism for running a poor campaign following the NDP&#x27;s unexpected defeat in the 2013 provincial election. On September 21, 2013, the day after Dix announced his intention to step down as leader, Sihota announced that he would be stepping down as party president at the end of his term in November 2013. He was credited with modernizing the NDP&#x27;s fundraising capacity and implementing outreach to the business community during his term.

==Personal life==
Sihota currently lives in Victoria, British Columbia and is married with two children, Rajan and Karina. Karina works in international affairs and Rajan works in Canada&#x27;s independent music industry.

<text>George Alfred Leon Sarton (; 31 August 1884 – 22 March 1956) was a Belgian-American chemist and historian. He is considered the founder of the discipline of the history of science as an independent field of study. His most influential works were the &quot;Introduction to the History of Science&quot;, which consists of three volumes and 4,296 pages, and the journal &quot;Isis&quot;. Sarton ultimately aimed to achieve an integrated philosophy of science that provided a connection between the sciences and the humanities, which he referred to as &quot;the new humanism&quot;.

==Life and work==
George Alfred Leon Sarton was born to Léonie Van Halmé and Alfred Sarton on August 31, 1884 in Ghent, East Flanders, Belgium. However, within a year of his birth, Sarton&#x27;s mother died. He attended school first in his hometown before later attending school for a period of four years in the town of Chimay. Sarton enrolled at the University of Ghent in 1902 to study philosophy, but found that the subject did not correspond with his interests and subsequently ceased his studies. In 1904, after a period of reflection, he re-enrolled in the university to study the natural sciences. During his time at the University of Ghent Sarton received several honors. In 1908, the four Belgian universities gave him a gold medal for chemistry, and the city of Ghent gave him a silver laurel for a memoir he wrote. He graduated with his doctorate in 1911 with a thesis in celestial mechanics. Shortly after his graduation, on June 22, 1911, Sarton married Elanor Mabel Elwes, an artist and distinguished furniture designer. The couple moved to a house in Wondelgem where their only child, a daughter, Eleanore Marie or May was born in 1912.

During World War 1, in August 1914, the German army invaded Belgium. At this time Sarton was no longer an official member of Belgium&#x27;s Civil Guard. Nevertheless, when the invasion occurred, he reported in and was assigned to patrol the nearby railroad intersection, but encountered no German soldiers that night. Under German occupation, members of the Civil Guard were treated as spies, and Sarton buried his Civil Guard coat in the garden so he would not be taken up and shot as a spy. During the occupation, twenty-six German soldiers were billeted at his house and he was held responsible for the soldiers&#x27; safety. If any of the enlisted men staying at his house had not met curfew, Sarton would have been shot. Soon after, the Sarton family fled to England, first traveling to the Netherlands then onward to London. They were not able to take many things with them, so the notes for Sarton&#x27;s History of Science were left buried with his coat. In England, Sarton worked in the War Office, but he was unable to support a family of three on his salary. He left for the United States in search of a position that would enable him to support his family and allow him to complete his dream of writing the History of Science. His wife and daughter followed him to America in September 1915.

Sarton taught at the University of Illinois in the summer of 1915 and received the award of the Prix Binoux of the Académie des Sciences, Paris, for his work in the history of science. He worked for the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace and lectured at Harvard University, 1916–18. While at Harvard University, Sarton lectured in philosophy in the academic year of 1916–1917, and in history of science in the academic year of 1917–1918. Sarton also taught at Teachers College at Columbia University during the summer of 1917. At Harvard, he became a lecturer in 1920, and a professor of the history of science from 1940 until his retirement in 1951. He supervised just two PhD students in Harvard&#x27;s history of science program to completion, the first such PhDs in America: Aydin M. Sayili and I. Bernard Cohen. His other two students, Louise Diehl Patterson and Helen L. Thomas, finished their PhDs at Harvard under Cohen. He was also a research associate of the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1919 until 1948. After being appointed as research associate, Sarton began planning the revival of &quot;Isis&quot;. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1927 and the American Philosophical Society in 1934.

Sarton intended to complete an exhaustive nine-volume history of science entitled Introduction to the History of Science. During the preparation of the second volume, he learned Arabic and traveled around the Middle East for part of his research, inspecting original manuscripts of Islamic scientists. During his time in the Middle East, he helped to institutionalize the school of Spanish Arabists. Sarton began working with the school of Spanish Arabists in 1928, then led by Julian Ribera y Tarrago and Miguel Asin Palacios. The Spanish Arabists contributed to Isis and Sarton had some of their articles published in Isis. Sarton shared more views in common with the Spanish Arabists than he did with other historians of science. They had similar views on what constitutes science. Sarton and the Spanish also shared similar views on diffusion. He led a group of scholars who acted as patrons to the Spanish. Sarton acknowledged that Julian Ribera was the leading Spanish Arabist. Sarton also was interested and wrote articles on Ribera&#x27;s research on the transition of Eastern music to the West. Sarton later associated his interest in scientific diffusion with Ribera&#x27;s interest in the transmission of music because in medieval times, music was commonly associated with mathematics and a part of the quadrivium. Sarton believed that the Islamic contribution to science was the most &quot;progressive&quot; element in medieval learning and was outraged when Western medieval studies ignored it. By the time of his death, he had completed only the first three volumes: I. From Homer to Omar Khayyam; II. From Rabbi Ben Ezra to Roger Bacon, pt. 1–2; and III. Science and learning in the fourteenth-century, pt. 1–2. Sarton had been inspired for his project by his study of Leonardo da Vinci, but he had not reached this period in history before dying. However one series of lectures Sarton gave during his first year at Harvard discussed da Vinci and were entitled &quot; Science and Civilization in the Time of Leonardo da Vinci, Scientist and Artist.&quot;

After his death (March 22, 1956, Cambridge, Massachusetts), a representative selection of Sarton&#x27;s papers was edited by Dorothy Stimson. It was published by Harvard University Press in 1962.

==History of Science Society==
The George Sarton Medal is the History of Science Society&#x27;s most prestigious award, given annually since 1955 to honor an outstanding historian of science for lifetime scholarly achievement. Sarton was the founder of the society and of its journals &quot;Isis&quot; and &quot;Osiris&quot;. Sarton edited &quot;Isis&quot; from 1913 to 1952.

<doc id="1097630" wikidata="Q7379488" url="?curid=1097630" title="Run 2">
<text>&quot;Run 2&quot; is the nineteenth single by English rock and alternative dance band New Order. It was released by Factory Records on 28 August 1989 as the third and final single from their fifth studio album, &quot;Technique&quot; (1989). The album version was listed as simply &quot;Run&quot;.

==Overview==
&quot;Run 2&quot; was remixed by Scott Litt from the version on &quot;Technique&quot;, hence the appendage of &quot;2&quot; to the title. The main difference is that the song has been made more radio-friendly by editing down most of the long instrumental run-out and appending it with a final repeat of the chorus. Litt&#x27;s mix strips back much of the echo and layers of synthesizers, and in place centres the mix on Sumner&#x27;s vocal and the bass guitar of Peter Hook. Despite the effort taken to produce a radio single, only 20,000 of the Factory 12&quot; release were ever pressed. 500 7-inch records were also pressed, for promotional use. The single was only released in the UK.

&quot;Run 2&quot; is backed with the B-side titled &quot;MTO&quot;. This song recycles the line &quot;You&#x27;ve got love technique&quot; from the group&#x27;s previous hit single &quot;Fine Time&quot; (this is the only lyric in the track). An extended mix of &quot;Run 2&quot; with additional beats by Afrika Islam and an alternate &#x27;minus&#x27; mix of &quot;MTO&quot; by Mike &quot;Hitman&quot; Wilson appear as B-sides on the 12&quot; version of the single.

==Artwork==
Peter Saville, the single&#x27;s cover designer, claimed to have been inspired by the design of laundry powder packaging. The tiny print on the back of the sleeve says, &quot;Cover by Peter Saville Associates after Bold.&quot;

==Lawsuit==
John Denver&#x27;s publishing company filed a lawsuit, alleging that the guitar break in &quot;Run&quot; too closely resembled Denver&#x27;s &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;. The case was settled out of court. The song has since been credited to New Order and John Denver.

==Video==
The video was directed by the photographer / filmmaker Robert Frank and produced by Michael Shamberg. The band was filmed in Los Angeles, while the street scenes are in New York City featuring the British actor David Warrilow.

<text>Penny Webster is a former mayor of Rodney District and a councillor on the Auckland Council. As mayor of Rodney she headed one of the six main local government entities generally considered as making up the Auckland metropolitan area (Auckland City, Manukau City, Waitakere City, North Shore City, Papakura District, Rodney District), with her district being the northernmost entity. All of these entities were merged into the new Auckland Council in 2010. She was also a former New Zealand politician: an MP from 1999 to 2002, representing the ACT New Zealand party.

Before entering politics, Webster was a farmer, and headed the Auckland branch of the Federated Farmers organisation.

== Member of Parliament ==

She was first elected to Parliament in the 1999 election, becoming a list MP.

In the 2002 election, however, she was ranked in thirteenth place, a low position for a sitting MP. Owen Jennings, another former farmer, was also ranked lowly, prompting some to suggest that ACT was not as interested in the rural vote as it might once have been.

ACT did not win sufficient votes for thirteen seats, and so Webster did not return to Parliament.

== Local government ==


In 2007 Webster was elected Mayor of Rodney District. In December 2008 she was unanimously elected as the chair of the Auckland Mayoral Forum.

In December 2008 she was also appointed by Environment Minister Nick Smith to sit on a technical advisory board on reforms to the Resource Management Act.

In 2010 Webster was elected to the inaugural Auckland Council, representing the Rodney Ward. She served as the Chairperson of the Strategy and Finance Committee.

Webster was re-elected in 2013. At the 2016 elections, Webster was defeated by Greg Sayers.

<text>The Georgia Guidestones was a granite monument that stood in Elbert County, Georgia, United States, from 1980 to 2022. It was tall and made from six granite slabs weighing a total of . The structure was sometimes referred to as an &quot;American Stonehenge&quot;. The monument&#x27;s creators believed that there was going to be an upcoming social, nuclear, or economic calamity and they wanted the monument to serve as a guide for humanity in the world which would exist after it. Controversial from its time of construction, it ultimately became the subject of conspiracy theories which alleged that it was actually connected to Satanism, as opposed to Christianity as its creator claimed.

On the morning of July 6, 2022, the guidestones were heavily damaged in a bombing from a vandal, and the debris and guidestones were removed by the local government later that day. In late July, Elberton Mayor Daniel Graves announced plans to rebuild the monument. In August, the Elbert County Board of Commissioners voted to donate the remains of the monument to the Elberton Granite Association, and return the of land on which the monument was erected to its previous owner.

==History==
=== Construction ===
In June 1979, a man using the pseudonym Robert C. Christian approached the Elberton Granite Finishing Company on behalf of &quot;a small group of loyal Americans&quot;, and commissioned the structure. Christian explained that the stones would function as a compass, calendar, and clock, and should be capable of &quot;withstanding catastrophic events&quot;. The man reportedly used the pseudonym as a reference to the Christian religion. Christian said that he wanted to build a granite monument that would rival the British Neolithic monument Stonehenge, which he drew inspiration from after paying it a visit. However, he said that while it was impressive, Stonehenge had no message to communicate.

Joe Fendley of Elberton Granite believed that Christian was &quot;a nut&quot;, and attempted to discourage him by providing a price quote for the commission which was several times higher than any project which the company had previously undertaken, explaining that the construction of the guidestones would require additional tools and consultants. To Fendley&#x27;s surprise, Christian accepted the quote. 

When arranging payment, Christian claimed that he represented a group which had been planning to construct the guidestones for 20 years and wanted to remain anonymous. Christian said he had chosen Elbert County because of its abundance of local granite, the rural nature of its landscape, its mild climate, and family ties to the region. The total cost of the project was not revealed, but it was over US$100,000 ().

Christian delivered a scale model of the guidestones and ten pages of specifications. The site was purchased by Christian from a local farm owner. The owner and his children were given lifetime cattle grazing rights on the guidestones site. The monument was located off Georgia State Route 77 around north of the city of Elberton.

On March 22, 1980, the monument was unveiled by congressman Doug Barnard before an audience of between 200 and 300 people. At the unveiling, the Master of Ceremonies read a message to the gathered audience:

Christian later transferred ownership of the land and the guidestones to Elbert County. In 1981, barbed wire fencing was erected around the monument to keep cattle out, as they had been using it for a scratching post.

A man who identified himself as Robert Christian published a book titled &quot;Common Sense Renewed&quot; (1986), which described the ideology of the guidestones. The author wrote:

Fendley believed that the monument would become a regional tourist attraction. In 2022, 20,000 annual visitors were reported.

&quot;Dark Clouds Over Elberton: The True Story of the Georgia Guidestones&quot; (2015) is a documentary film purporting to expose the true identity of Robert Christian. The makers of the documentary claimed to have investigated and interviewed a banker who was involved in the financial arrangements for the construction of the monument.

=== Reaction ===
The monument was controversial even before it was unveiled. Some locals referred to its construction as &#x27;the devil&#x27;s work&#x27;. A local minister warned that &quot;occult groups&quot; would visit the site and that a sacrifice was imminent. A 2009 &quot;Wired&quot; article also noted that sandblaster Charlie Clamp spent hundreds of hours on the etching, during which time he was &quot;constantly distracted by strange music and disjointed voices&quot;.
In 2008, the stones were defaced with aerosol paint and graffiti with slogans such as &quot;Death to the New World Order&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; magazine called the defacement &quot;the first serious act of vandalism in the guidestones&#x27; history&quot;. In September 2014, an employee of the Elbert County maintenance department contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation when the stones were vandalized with graffiti including the phrase: &quot;I Am Isis, goddess of love.&quot; After the acts of vandalism, security cameras were installed on the site.

Kandiss Taylor, a candidate in the 2022 Georgia Republican gubernatorial primary, called the Guidestones &quot;Satanic&quot; in a campaign ad; her campaign platform called for the monument to be removed.

=== Destruction ===

On July 6, 2022, an explosive device was detonated at the site, destroying the Swahili/Hindi language slab and causing significant damage to the capstone. Nearby residents reportedly heard and felt explosions at around 4:00 a.m. CCTV footage recorded a vehicle leaving the scene and police investigated the incident. The remaining stones were dismantled by authorities for safety reasons later in the day with a backhoe, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). &quot;The Elberton Star&quot; reported that digging showed no evidence that there was ever a time capsule located beneath the Georgia Guidestones.

====Aftermath====
The Elbert County Sheriff&#x27;s Office investigated the bombing, with assistance from the GBI. On the evening of the bombing, the GBI released a video showing both the explosion, and a vehicle of interest leaving the scene shortly before. No motive has been publicly shared, and no suspects publicly identified. On July 14, 2022, and again on July 25, 2022, the GBI gave an update, with no significant progress on the case being made since the bombing. Prosecutors suggested that as the guidestones were maintained by the county, they were considered a public building, thus their destruction would carry a minimum sentence of 20 years in prison.

In late July 2022, Elberton Mayor Daniel Graves said the town planned to rebuild the monument exactly as it was, adding &quot;We&#x27;re just getting geared up and excited about rebuilding them. It&#x27;s going to happen. It may take us six months to a year to do it, but we are going to do it.&quot; On August 8, 2022, the Elberton city council voted to begin legal proceedings to return the five acres of land the monument had been built on to its previous owner, a local farm. The city council announced that the remains of the monument, which had been moved to a third-party location for safety reasons, would be given to the Elberton Granite Association. Both the Elberton Granite Association and the Elberton city council expressed doubt that the guidestones would be rebuilt, but expressed hope that one day it could happen.

==Description==
===Inscriptions===

A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles was engraved on the Georgia Guidestones in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages were English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Traditional Chinese, and Russian. The languages were chosen because they represented most of humanity, except for Hebrew, which was chosen because of its connections to Judaism and Christianity. 

According to the monument&#x27;s sponsors, the inscriptions are meant to guide humanity to conserve nature after a nuclear war, which the creators thought was an imminent threat. The inscriptions dealt with four main themes: &quot;governance and the establishment of a world government, population and reproduction control, the environment and humankind&#x27;s relationship to nature, and spirituality.&quot;

The inscriptions read:

: Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
: Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity.
: Unite humanity with a living new language.
: Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason.
: Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
: Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
: Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
: Balance personal rights with social duties.
: Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite.
: Be not a cancer on the Earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature.

===Explanatory tablet===
A few feet to the west of the monument, an additional granite ledger had been set level with the ground. This tablet identified the structure and the languages used on it and listed various facts about the size, weight, and astronomical features of the stones, the date it was installed, and the sponsors of the project. It referred to a time capsule buried under the tablet, but blank spaces on the stone intended for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and was to be opened had not been inscribed, so it was uncertain if the time capsule was ever actually put in place. During the removal of the monument in July 2022, county officials dug six feet down underneath this tablet to check for a time capsule, but found nothing.

The text of the explanatory tablet was somewhat inconsistent with respect to punctuation and misspelled the word &quot;pseudonym&quot;. The original spelling, punctuation, and line breaks in the text have been preserved in the transcription (letter case is not). At the top center of the tablet was written:

Immediately below this was the outline of a square, inside which was written:

Around the edges of the square were written translations to four ancient languages, one per edge. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise, they were: Babylonian (in cuneiform script), Classical Greek, Sanskrit and Ancient Egyptian (in hieroglyphs).


On the left side of the tablet was a column of text (metric conversion added):
The words appeared as shown under the time capsule heading; no dates were engraved.

===Physical data===
On the right side of the tablet was a column of text (metric conversions added):
===Guidestone languages===
Below the two columns of text were written the caption &quot;GUIDESTONE LANGUAGES&quot;, with a diagram of the granite slab layout beneath it. The names of eight modern languages were inscribed along the long edges of the projecting rectangles, one per edge. Starting from due north and moving clockwise around so that the upper edge of the northeast rectangle was listed first, they were English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. At the bottom center of the tablet was the text:

===Astronomical features===
The four outer stones were oriented to mark the limits of the 18.6 year lunar declination cycle. The center column featured a hole drilled at an angle from one side to the other, through which the North Star could be seen. The same pillar had a slot carved through it which was aligned with the Sun&#x27;s solstices and equinoxes. A -in (22 mm) aperture in the capstone allowed a ray of sun to pass through at noon each day, shining a beam on the center stone indicating the day of the year.
University of Georgia Astronomer Loris Magnani referred to these features as &quot;mediocre at best&quot; and sees them as &quot;an abacus compared to Stonehenge’s computer&quot;.
==Interpretations==
When commissioning the guidestones, Christian described them as a guide for future generations to manage limited resources, potentially in the face of nuclear war. Yoko Ono said the inscribed messages were &quot;a stirring call to rational thinking&quot;. However, the guidestones&#x27; inscriptions have also been accused of promoting eugenics and genocide.

=== Conspiracy theories ===
The guidestones became a subject of interest for conspiracy theorists. &quot;Wired&quot; stated that unspecified opponents have labeled them the &quot;Ten Commandments of the Antichrist&quot;. Some conservative Christians have called the monument Satanic.

Right-wing activist Mark Dice demanded that the guidestones should &quot;be smashed into a million pieces, and then the rubble should be used for a construction project&quot;, claiming that the guidestones are of &quot;a deep Satanic origin&quot;, and that R. C. Christian belongs to &quot;a Luciferian secret society&quot; related to the New World Order. At the unveiling of the monument, a local minister proclaimed that he believed that the monument was &quot;for sun worshipers, for cult worship and for devil worship&quot;.

Conspiracy theorist Jay Weidner has said that the pseudonym of the man who commissioned the stones – &quot;R. C. Christian&quot; – resembles Rose Cross Christian, or Christian Rosenkreuz, the founder of the Rosicrucian Order. Others who agree with Weidner point to the Rosicrucian&#x27;s first manifesto written in 1614, which states “The word R.C. should be their seal, mark and character”. They also see similarities between the writing on the capstone, and the title of (Rosicrucian) Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;.

<text>George Udny Yule, CBE, FRS (18 February 1871 – 26 June 1951), usually known as Udny Yule, was a British statistician, particularly known for the Yule distribution and proposing the preferential attachment model for random graphs.

== Personal life==

Yule was born at Beech Hill, a house in Morham near Haddington, Scotland and died in Cambridge, England. He came from a Scottish family composed of army officers, civil servants, scholars, and administrators. His father, Sir George Udny Yule (1813–1886) was a brother of the noted orientalist Sir Henry Yule (1820–1889). His great uncle was the botanist John Yule.

In 1899, Yule married May Winifred Cummings. The marriage was annulled in 1912, producing no children.

== Education and teaching ==
Udny Yule was educated at Winchester College and at the age of 16 at University College London where he read engineering. After a year in Bonn doing research in experimental physics under Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, Yule returned to University College in 1893 to work as a demonstrator for Karl Pearson, one of his former teachers. Pearson was beginning to work in statistics and Yule followed him into this new field. Yule progressed to an assistant professorship but he left in 1899 to a better-paid position as secretary to an examination board, working under Philip Magnus at the City and Guilds Institute.

In 1902 Yule became Newmarch lecturer in statistics at University College, a position he held together with his post at the City and Guilds Institute. He continued to publish articles and also wrote an influential textbook, &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Statistics&quot; (1911), based on his lectures.

In 1912 Yule moved to Cambridge University to a newly created Lectureship in Statistics and he remained in Cambridge for the rest of his life. During the First World War Yule worked for the army and then for the Ministry of Food. A heart attack in 1931 left him semi-invalided and led to his early retirement. His flow of publications almost ceased but, in the 1940s he found new interests, one of which led to a book, &quot;The Statistical Study of Literary Vocabulary&quot;.

== Scholarship ==
Yule was a prolific writer, the highlight of his publications being perhaps the textbook &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Statistics&quot;, which went through fourteen editions and was published in several languages. He was active in the Royal Statistical Society, was awarded its Guy Medal in Gold in 1911, and served as its president in 1924–26.

Yule&#x27;s first paper on statistics appeared in 1895: &quot;On the Correlation of Total Pauperism with Proportion of Out-relief&quot;. Yule was interested in applying statistical techniques to social problems and he quickly became a member of the Royal Statistical Society. For many years the only members interested in mathematical statistics were Yule, Edgeworth and Bowley. In 1897–99 Yule wrote important papers on correlation and regression. After 1900 he worked on a parallel theory of association. His approach to association was quite different from Pearson&#x27;s and relations between them deteriorated. Yule had broad interests and his collaborators included the agricultural meteorologist R. H. Hooker, the medical statistician Major Greenwood and the agricultural scientist Sir Frank Engledow. Yule&#x27;s sympathy towards the newly rediscovered Mendelian theory of genetics led to several papers.

In the 1920s Yule wrote three influential papers on time series analysis, &quot;On the time-correlation problem&quot; (1921), a critique of the variate difference method, an investigation of a form of spurious correlation (1926) and &quot;On a Method of Investigating Periodicities in Disturbed Series, with Special Reference to Wolfer&#x27;s Sunspot Numbers&quot; (1927), which used an autoregressive model to model the sunspot time series instead of the established periodogram method of Schuster.

== Yule distribution ==

In 1922, J. C. Willis published &quot;Age and Area&quot;, based on botanical field work in Ceylon, where he studied the distributional patterns of the Ceylonese vascular plants in great detail. He compiled a table of the number of existent species in each genus of flowering plants, and the same for the Rubiaceae, and for the Chrysomelid beetles. 

Let formula_1 be the number of genera with formula_2 existent species. When formula_1 is plotted on a log-log plot, each of these follows a straight line. This shows that formula_4 for some formula_5. That is, the distribution has a power-law tail. The figures are found in, or page 241 and 242.

In 1925 Yule published the paper &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Evolution, based on the Conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, F.R.S.&quot;, where he proposed a stochastic process which reproduces the power-law tail. 
This was later called the Yule process, but is now better known as preferential attachment.
Herbert A. Simon dubbed the resulting distribution the Yule distribution in his honour.

== Assessment ==
Frank Yates culminated his 1952 obituary of Yule by saying:

“To summarize we may, I think, justly conclude that though Yule did not fully develop any completely new branches of statistical theory, he took the first steps in many directions which were later to prove fruitful lines for further progress… He can indeed rightly claim to be one of the pioneers of modern statistics”.
Yule made important contributions to the theory and practice of correlation, regression, and association, as well as to time series analysis. He pioneered the use of preferential attachment stochastic processes to explain the origin of power law distribution. The Yule distribution, a discrete power law, is named after him.

Although Yule taught at Cambridge for twenty years, he had little impact on the development of statistics there. M. S. Bartlett recalled him as a &quot;mentor&quot; but his famous association with Maurice Kendall, who revised the &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Statistics&quot;, only came about after Kendall had graduated.

<text>A flood basalt (or plateau basalt) is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that covers large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava. Many flood basalts have been attributed to the onset of a hotspot reaching the surface of the Earth via a mantle plume. Flood basalt provinces such as the Deccan Traps of India are often called &quot;traps&quot;, after the Swedish word &quot;trappa&quot; (meaning &quot;staircase&quot;), due to the characteristic stairstep geomorphology of many associated landscapes.

Michael R. Rampino and Richard Stothers (1988) cited eleven distinct flood basalt episodes occurring in the past 250 million years, creating large igneous provinces, lava plateaus, and mountain ranges. However, more have been recognized such as the large Ontong Java Plateau, and the Chilcotin Group, though the latter may be linked to the Columbia River Basalt Group.

Large igneous provinces have been connected to five mass extinction events, and may be associated with bolide impacts.

==Description==

Flood basalts are the most voluminous of all extrusive igneous rocks, forming enormous deposits of basaltic rock found throughout the geologic record. They are a highly distinctive form of intraplate volcanism, set apart from all other forms of volcanism by the huge volumes of lava erupted in geologically short time intervals. A single flood basalt province may contain hundreds of thousands of cubic kilometers of basalt erupted over less than a million years, with individual events each erupting hundreds of cubic kilometers of basalt. This highly fluid basalt lava can spread laterally for hundreds of kilometers from its source vents, covering areas of tens of thousands of square kilometers. Successive eruptions form thick accumulations of nearly horizontal flows, erupted in rapid succession over vast areas, flooding the Earth&#x27;s surface with lava on a regional scale.

These vast accumulations of flood basalt constitute large igneous provinces. These are characterized by plateau landforms, so that flood basalts are also described as &quot;plateau basalts&quot;. Canyons cut into the flood basalts by erosion display stair-like slopes, with the lower parts of flows forming cliffs and the upper part of flows or interbedded layers of sediments forming slopes. These are known in Dutch as &quot;trap&quot; or in Swedish as &quot;trappa&quot;, which has come into English as &quot;trap rock&quot;, a term particularly used in the quarry industry.

The great thickness of the basalt accumulations, often in excess of , usually reflects a very large number of thin flows, varying in thickness from meters to tens of meters, or more rarely to . There are occasionally very thick individual flows. The world&#x27;s thickest basalt flow may be the Greenstone flow of the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan, US, which is thick. This flow may have been part of a lava lake the size of Lake Superior.

Deep erosion of flood basalts exposes vast numbers of parallel dikes that fed the eruptions. Some individual dikes in the Columbia River Plateau are over long. In some cases, erosion exposes radial sets of dikes with diameters of several thousand kilometers. Sills may also be present beneath flood basalts, such as the Palisades Sill of New Jersey, US. The sheet intrusions (dikes and sills) beneath flood basalts are typically diabase that closely matches the composition of the overlying flood basalts. In some cases, the chemical signature allows individual dikes to be connected with individual flows.

===Smaller-scale features===
Flood basalt commonly displays columnar jointing, formed as the rock cooled and contracted after solidifying from the lava. The rock fractures into columns, typically with five to six sides, parallel to the direction of heat flow out of the rock. This is generally perpendicular to the upper and lower surfaces, but rainwater infiltrating the rock unevenly can produce &quot;cold fingers&quot; of distorted columns. Because heat flow out of the base of the flow is slower than from its upper surface, the columns are more regular and larger in the bottom third of the flow. The greater hydrostatic pressure, due to the weight of overlying rock, also contributes to making the lower columns larger. By analogy with Greek temple architecture, the more regular lower columns are described as the &quot;colonnade&quot; and the more irregular upper fractures as the &quot;entablature&quot; of the individual flow. Columns tend to be larger in thicker flows, with columns of the very thick Greenstone flow, mentioned earlier, being around thick.

Another common small-scale feature of flood basalts is &quot;pipe-stem vesicles&quot;. Flood basalt lava cools quite slowly, so that dissolved gases in the lava have time to come out of solution as bubbles (vesicles) that float to the top of the flow. Most of the rest of the flow is massive and free of vesicles. However, the more rapidly cooling lava close to the base of the flow forms a thin chilled margin of glassy rock, and the more rapidly crystallized rock just above the glassy margin contains vesicles trapped as the rock was rapidly crystallizing. These have a distinctive appearance likened to a clay tobacco pipe stem, particularly as the vesicle is usually subsequently filled with calcite or other light-colored minerals that contrast with the surrounding dark basalt.

=== Petrology ===
At still smaller scales, the texture of flood basalts is aphanitic, consisting of tiny interlocking crystals. These interlocking crystals give trap rock its tremendous toughness and durability. Crystals of plagioclase are embedded in or wrapped around crystals of pyroxene and are randomly oriented. This indicates rapid emplacement so that the lava is no longer flowing rapidly when it begins to crystallize. Flood basalts are almost devoid of large phenocrysts, larger crystals present in the lava prior to its being erupted to the surface, which are often present in other extrusive igneous rocks. Phenocrysts are more abundant in the dikes that fed lava to the surface.

Flood basalts are most often quartz tholeiites. Olivine tholeiite (the characteristic rock of mid-ocean ridges) occurs less commonly, and there are rare cases of alkali basalts. Regardless of composition, the flows are very homogeneous and rarely contain xenoliths, fragments of the surrounding rock (country rock) that have been entrained in the lava. Because the lavas are low in dissolved gases, pyroclastic rock is extremely rare. Except where the flows entered lakes and became pillow lava, the flows are massive (featureless). Occasionally, flood basalts are associated with very small volumes of dacite or rhyolite (much more silica-rich volcanic rock), which forms late in the development of a large igneous province and marks a shift to more centralized volcanism.

=== Geochemistry ===

Flood basalts show a considerable degree of chemical uniformity across geologic time, being mostly iron-rich tholeiitic basalts. Their major element chemistry is similar to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), while their trace element chemistry, particularly of the rare earth elements, resembles that of ocean island basalt. They typically have a silica content of around 52%. The magnesium number (the mol% of magnesium out of the total iron and magnesium content) is around 55, versus 60 for a typical MORB. The rare earth elements show abundance patterns suggesting that the original (primitive) magma formed from rock of the Earth&#x27;s mantle that was nearly &quot;undepleted&quot;; that is, it was mantle rock rich in garnet and from which little magma had previously been extracted. The chemistry of plagioclase and olivine in flood basalts suggests that the magma was only slightly contaminated with melted rock of the Earth&#x27;s crust, but some high-temperature minerals had already crystallized out of the rock before it reached the surface. In other words, the flood basalt is moderately evolved. However, only small amounts of plagioclase appear to have crystallized out of the melt.

Though regarded as forming a chemically homogeneous group, flood basalts sometimes show significant chemical diversity even with in a single province. For example, the flood basalts of the Parana Basin can be divided into a low phosphorus and titanium group (LPT) and a high phosphorus and titanium group (HPT). The difference has been attributed to inhomogeneity in the upper mantle, but strontium isotope ratios suggest the difference may arise from the LPT magma being contaminated with a greater amount of melted crust.

==Formation==

Theories of the formation of flood basalts must explain how such vast amounts of magma could be generated and erupted as lava in such short intervals of time. They must also explain the similar compositions and tectonic settings of flood basalts erupted across geologic time and the ability of flood basalt lava to travel such great distances from the eruptive fissures before solidifying.

===Generation of melt===
A tremendous amount of heat is required for so much magma to be generated in so short a time. This is widely believed to have been supplied by a mantle plume impinging on the base of the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere, its rigid outermost shell. The plume consists of unusually hot mantle rock of the asthenosphere, the ductile layer just below the lithosphere, that creeps upwards from deeper in the Earth&#x27;s interior. The hot asthenosphere rifts the lithosphere above the plume, allowing magma produced by decompressional melting of the plume head to find pathways to the surface.

The swarms of parallel dikes exposed by deep erosion of flood basalts show that considerable crustal extension has taken place. The dike swarms of west Scotland and Iceland show extension of up to 5%. Many flood basalts are associated with rift valleys, are located on passive continental plate margins, or extend into aulacogens (failed arms of triple junctions where continental rifting begins.) Flood basalts on continents are often aligned with hotspot volcanism in ocean basins. The Paraná and Etendeka traps, located in South America and Africa on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, formed around 125 million years ago as the South Atlantic opened, while a second set of smaller flood basalts formed near the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in eastern North America as the North Atlantic opened. However, the North Atlantic flood basalts are not connected with any hot spot traces, but seem to have been evenly distributed along the entire divergent boundary.

Flood basalts are often interbedded with sediments, typically red beds. The deposition of sediments begins before the first flood basalt eruptions, so that subsidence and crustal thinning are precursors to flood basalt activity. The surface continues to subside as basalt erupt, so that the older beds are often found below sea level. Basalt strata at depth (&quot;dipping reflectors&quot;) have been found by reflection seismology along passive continental margins.

=== Ascent to the surface ===
The composition of flood basalts may reflect the mechanisms by which the magma reaches the surface. The original melt formed in the upper mantle (the &quot;primitive melt&quot;) cannot have the composition of quartz tholeiite, the most common and typically least evolved volcanic rock of flood basalts, because quartz tholeiites are too rich in iron relative to magnesium to have formed in equilibrium with typical mantle rock. The primitive melt may have had the composition of picrite basalt, but picrite basalt is uncommon in flood basalt provinces. One possibility is that a primitive melt &quot;stagnates&quot; when it reaches the mantle-crust boundary, where it is not buoyant enough to penetrate the lower-density crust rock. As a tholeiitic magma differentiates (changes in composition as high-temperature minerals crystallize and settle out of the magma) its density reaches a minimum at a magnesium number of about 60, similar to that of flood basalts. This restores buoyancy and permits the magma to complete its journey to the surface, and also explains why flood basalts are predominantly quartz tholeiites. Over half the original magma remains in the lower crust as cumulates in a system of dikes and sills.

As the magma rises, the drop in pressure also lowers the liquidus, the temperature at which the magma is fully liquid. This likely explains the lack of phenocrysts in erupted flood basalt. The &quot;resorption&quot; (dissolution back into the melt) of a mixture of solid olivine, augite, and plagioclase—the high-temperature minerals likely to form as phenocrysts—may also tend to drive the composition closer to quartz tholeiite and help maintain buoyancy.

=== Eruption ===
Once the magma reaches the surface, it flows rapidly across the landscape, literally flooding the local topography. This is possible in part because of the rapid rate of extrusion (over a cubic km per day per km of fissure length) and the relatively low viscosity of basaltic lava. However, the lateral extent of individual flood basalt flows is astonishing even for so fluid a lava in such quantities. It is likely that the lava spreads by a process of &quot;inflation&quot; in which the lava moves beneath a solid insulating crust, which keeps it hot and mobile. Studies of the Ginkgo flow of the Columbia River Plateau, which is thick, show that the temperature of the lava dropped by just over a distance of . This demonstrates that the lava must have been insulated by a surface crust and that the flow was laminar, reducing heat exchange with the upper crust and base of the flow. It has been estimated that the Ginkgo flow advanced 500 km in six days (a rate of advance of about 3.5 km per hour).

The lateral extent of a flood basalt flow is roughly proportional to the cube of the thickness of the flow near its source. Thus, a flow that is double in thickness at its source can travel roughly eight times as far.

Flood basalt flows are predominantly pāhoehoe flows, with ʻaʻā flows much less common.

Eruption in flood basalt provinces is episodic, and each episode has its own chemical signature. There is some tendency for lava within a single eruptive episode to become more silica-rich with time, but there is no consistent trend across episodes.

==Large igneous provinces==

Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) were originally defined as voluminous outpourings, predominantly of basalt, over geologically very short durations. This definition did not specify minimum size, duration, petrogenesis, or setting. A new attempt to refine classification focuses on size and setting. LIPs characteristically cover large areas, and the great bulk of the magmatism occurs in less than 1 Ma. Principal LIPs in the ocean basins include &quot;Oceanic Volcanic Plateaus&quot; (OPs) and &quot;Volcanic Passive Continental Margins&quot;. &quot;Oceanic flood basalts&quot; are LIPs distinguished from oceanic plateaus by some investigators because they do not form morphologic plateaus, being neither flat-topped nor elevated more than 200 m above the seafloor. Examples include the Caribbean, Nauru, East Mariana, and Pigafetta provinces. Continental flood basalts (CFBs) or plateau basalts are the continental expressions of large igneous provinces.

==Impact==
Flood basalts contribute significantly to the growth of continental crust. They are also catastrophic events, which likely contributed to many mass extinctions in the geologic record.

===Crust formation===
The extrusion of flood basalts, averaged over time, is comparable with the rate of extrusion of lava at mid-ocean ridges and much higher than the rate of extrusion by hotspots. However, extrusion at mid-ocean ridges is relatively steady, while extrusion of flood basalts is highly episodic. Flood basalts create new continental crust at a rate of per year, while the eruptions that form oceanic plateaus produce of crust per year.

Much of the new crust formed during flood basalt episodes takes the form of underplating, with over half the original magma crystallizing out as cumulates in sills at the base of the crust.

===Mass extinctions===

The eruption of flood basalts has been linked with mass extinctions. For example, the Deccan Traps, erupted at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, may have contributed to the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Likewise, mass extinctions at the Permian-Triassic boundary, the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, and in the Toarcian Age of the Jurassic correspond to the ages of large igneous provinces in Siberia, the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, and the Karoo-Ferrar flood basalt.

Some idea of the impact of flood basalts can be given by comparison with historical large eruptions. The 1783 eruption of Lakagígar was the largest in the historical record, killing 75% of the livestock and a quarter of the population of Iceland. However, the eruption produced just of lava, which is tiny compared with the Roza Member of the Columbia River Plateau, erupted in the mid-Miocene, which contained at least of lava.

During the eruption of the Siberian Traps, some of magma penetrated the crust, covering an area of , equal to 62% of the area of the contiguous states of the United States. The hot magma contained vast quantities of carbon dioxide and sulfur oxides, and released additional carbon dioxide and methane from deep petroleum reservoirs and younger coal beds in the region. The released gases created over 6400 diatreme-like &quot;pipes&quot;, each typically over in diameter. The pipes emitted up to 160 trillion tons of carbon dioxide and 46 trillion tons of methane. Coal ash from burning coal beds spread toxic chromium, arsenic, mercury, and lead across northern Canada. Evaporite beds heated by the magma released hydrochloric acid, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, which damaged the ozone layer and reduced ultraviolet shielding by as much as 85%. Over 5 trillion tons of sulfur dioxide was also released. The carbon dioxide produced extreme greenhouse conditions, with global average sea water temperatures peaking at , the highest ever seen in the geologic record. Temperatures did not drop to for another 5.1 million years. Temperatures this high are lethal to most marine organisms, and land plants have difficulty continuing to photosynthesize at temperatures above . The Earth&#x27;s equatorial zone became a dead zone.

However, not all large igneous provinces are connected with extinction events. The formation and effects of a flood basalt depend on a range of factors, such as continental configuration, latitude, volume, rate, duration of eruption, style and setting (continental vs. oceanic), the preexisting climate, and the biota resilience to change.

Representative continental flood basalts and oceanic plateaus, arranged by chronological order, together forming a listing of large igneous provinces:

===Elsewhere in the Solar System===
Flood basalts are the dominant form of magmatism on the other planets and moons of the Solar System.

The maria on the Moon have been described as flood basalts composed of picritic basalt. Individual eruptive episodes were likely similar in volume to flood basalts of Earth, but were separated by much longer quiescent intervals and were likely produced by different mechanisms.

Extensive flood basalts are present on Mars.

== Uses ==
Trap rock is the most durable construction aggregate of all rock types, because the interlocking crystals are oriented at random.

<doc id="1097663" wikidata="Q118899" url="?curid=1097663" title="Brazilian Highlands">
<text>The Brazilian Highlands or Brazilian Plateau () is an extensive geographical region covering most of the eastern, southern and central portions of Brazil, in all some 4,500,000 km2 (1,930,511 sq mi) or approximately half of the country&#x27;s land area. The vast majority of Brazil&#x27;s population (203.062.512; &quot;2022 census&quot;) lives in the highlands or on the narrow coastal region immediately adjacent to it.

Ancient basaltic lava flows gave birth to much of the region. However, the time of dramatic geophysical activity is long past, as there is now no seismic or volcanic activity. Erosion has also played a large part in shaping the Highlands, forming extensive sedimentary deposits and wearing down the mountains.

The Brazilian Highlands are recognized for its great diversity: within the region there are several different biomes, vastly different climatic conditions, many types of soil, and thousands of animal and plant species.

==Major divisions==
Due to its size and diversity, the Brazilian Highlands is usually divided into three main areas:

*Atlantic Plateau extending all along the eastern coast of Brazil, and including several mountain ranges. It was once almost completely covered by the Atlantic Rainforest, one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world, of which only 7.3% remains.
*Southern Plateau, advancing inland in the southern and southern-central portions of the country. Sedimentary rocks covered partially by basaltic lava spills form the fertile ground known as &quot;purple land&quot;. Large portions of this region were also covered by the Atlantic Rainforest, while araucaria highland forest and cerrado grasslands take up much of the rest of the space.
*Central Plateau occupying the central portions of Brazil, with sedimentary and crystalline formations. Approximately 85% were once covered by cerrado vegetation, of which only a small portion remains intact.
In addition to the plateau regions, several adjoining or enclosed mountain ranges are considered to be part of the Brazilian Highlands. Some of the most important are (from north to south):
*Serra da Borborema
*Chapada Diamantina
*Serra do Espinhaço
*Serra do Caparaó
*Serra da Mantiqueira
*Serra do Mar 
*Serra Geral

The highest point of the Brazilian Highlands is the Pico da Bandeira in the Serra do Caparaó, 2,891 meters (9,485 ft).

<text>Judith Mary Keall (&quot;née&quot; Dixon, born 10 January 1942) is a former New Zealand politician. She was an MP from 1984 to 1990, and again from 1993 until her retirement in 2002, representing the Labour Party.

==Biography==


Dixon was born in Timaru on 10 May 1942.

She was first elected to Parliament in the 1984 election, winning the North Shore seat of Glenfield. She was re-elected in the 1987 election, but in the 1990 election, she was defeated by National&#x27;s Peter Hilt. In 1993, Keall was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

In the 1993 election, she returned to Parliament as MP for the lower North Island seat of Horowhenua. After reentering parliament she supported Mike Moore when he was successfully challenged for the leadership by deputy leader Helen Clark. She was appointed by Clark as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for consumer affairs and senior citizens. In the 1996 election, when the Horowhenua electorate was abolished, she was elected as MP for the new Otaki electorate. She was re-elected in the 1999 election, but at the 2002 election, she chose to retire from Parliament. She was one of only two electorate MPs who retired in 2002; the other was Labour&#x27;s Geoff Braybrooke. Keall was succeeded by her former Parliamentary Secretary, Darren Hughes.

Keall chaired Parliament&#x27;s health select committee and she was the key proponent of legislation that would make bars and restaurants smoke-free.

Keall was separated from her husband Graeme for seven years and part of her retirement from politics was that she could spend more time with him.

<text>Kimmo Samuel Timonen (born 18 March 1975) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey defenseman who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Nashville Predators, Philadelphia Flyers, and Chicago Blackhawks. Timonen had played in over 1,100 NHL games before retiring. During his career, Timonen had also featured in three IIHF World Junior Championships, seven IIHF World Championships, two World Cups and five Olympic tournaments. He won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2015 in his final career game.

He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Playing career==
Timonen was the youngest player to play for Finland at the 1993 IIHF World Junior Championships at the age of 17. He recorded the second-highest shot total in the tournament with 44.

Timonen was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the tenth round, 250th overall, of the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. After the draft, he continued to play in his native Finland for several years, first for KalPa and then later for TPS. In 1998, Timonen played on the bronze medal-winning Finnish Olympic team in Nagano. Shortly after the Olympics, the Kings traded him, along with Jan Vopat, to the Nashville Predators organization (the team not yet having begun play) in agreement that Nashville would not select Garry Galley in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft.

===With the Nashville Predators ===
During the 1998–99 season, Timonen split time between Nashville and their IHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. The following year, he was promoted to a full-time NHL player. He played the next four seasons for the Predators, steadily improving his offensive output, until the 2004–05 NHL lockout. During the lockout, Timonen played for his hometown team, KalPa, which he partly owns with former Flyers teammate Sami Kapanen. Timonen also persuaded his teammate Adam Hall to play for KalPa for the duration of the lockout.

Timonen represented Finland at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey and led his team in scoring with six points, the fifth-highest total overall in the tournament.

On 3 October 2006, Timonen was named the captain of the Nashville Predators for the 2006–07 season. That season proved to be a career year for Timonen, as he registered career highs in both assists and total points.

===With the Philadelphia Flyers ===
Following the 2006–07 season, Timonen was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers. Shortly after, he signed a six-year, $37.8 million contract extension with them, a deal which made him the highest paid Finn in the NHL. At the time, Timonen&#x27;s younger brother Jussi Timonen was playing for the Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. However, Jussi was subsequently traded to the Dallas Stars early in the 2007–08 season.
The Flyers beat the Washington Capitals 4–3 and the Montreal Canadiens 4–1 in the first two rounds of the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs. During Game 4 of the Flyers&#x27; series with Montreal, Timonen was hit by a wrist shot on his foot by Canadiens defenseman Andrei Markov. Timonen felt numbness in his foot as the week progressed, though believed it to be nothing but a twisted nerve. After an MRI failed to reveal any injury, Timonen had the foot examined at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where, on 8 May, the doctor found a small blood clot in his foot. He was sidelined indefinitely and missed the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Timonen returned for Game 5, but the Flyers eventually lost the game and their playoff run came to an end.

In the 2009–10 regular season, Timonen led all NHL defensemen in shorthanded goals scored, with two. That year, Timonen would play in his first ever Stanley Cup Finals, though the Flyers would lose to the Chicago Blackhawks in a six-game series.

Timonen scored his 100th career goal on 5 March 2011, against the Buffalo Sabres. He ended the season in a tie with Marc Staal for most shorthanded goals among defensemen, with two.

Timonen recorded his 500th career point with an assist on 1 March 2012, against the New York Islanders. He played his 1,000th NHL game on 18 March 2013, his 37th birthday.
===Blood clots and Stanley Cup victory with the Chicago Blackhawks ===
While preparing for the 2014–15 season, on 5 August 2014, Timonen was diagnosed with blood clots in both of his lungs as well as in his right leg. The serious nature of injury ruled Timonen out indefinitely with the Flyers. Approaching the NHL trade deadline, and returning to health after missing the first 62 games of the season, Timonen was traded by the Flyers to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for a 2015 second-round pick and 2016 conditional fourth-round pick on 27 February 2015. He left the Flyers organization as the third most productive defenseman in franchise history, with 270 points in 519 games. On 21 March 2015, he played in his 1,100th NHL game.

On 5 March, Timonen announced his intent to retire from professional hockey after the 2014–15 season. On 15 June, Timonen won his first Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks in the final game of his 20-year career. During the celebration, Timonen was the first player to receive the Stanley Cup following captain Jonathan Toews. Timonen reflected on his career stating, &quot;I was dreaming about this moment for a long time, and it’s right here. This game has given me so much, and I’m relieved, happy, ready to leave this game, and I’m leaving this game as a Stanley Cup champion.&quot; He was the last active player in the NHL from the 1993 NHL entry draft.

In February 2016, President Barack Obama received the winning Blackhawks team in the White House. During his speech, he unexpectedly gave Timonen a laudation:

Timonen commented on this to the Finnish state broadcasting company YLE:
==Personal life==
Kimmo is married to Johanna Timonen and has 3 children.
Kimmo announced his retirement after winning the Stanley Cup in 2015 with the Blackhawks.
Timonen owns several restaurants and nightclubs in his hometown of Kuopio.

<text>Waldorf University is a private tax-exempt university in Forest City, Iowa. It was founded in 1903 and associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and its predecessors. In 2010, it was sold to Columbia Southern University and became a for-profit institution; twelve years later, on January 1, 2022, ownership was transferred to the Waldorf Lutheran College Foundation, returning the university to its non-profit roots.

== History ==
Waldorf University, founded in 1903 as Waldorf College, was a result of &quot;The Great Hotel War of Forest City&quot;, a competitive battle between Forest City&#x27;s two upper-class hotels, which were built at the same time. The result was the Waldorf Hotel being left vacant after only four months of operation. The vacant hotel provided an opportunity for Rev. C.S. Salveson to create a Christian college. Waldorf started out as an academy and business college, not just a preparatory program for future pastors. From its earliest days, Waldorf viewed education sponsored by the church as essential for success in society.

Since 1920, Waldorf&#x27;s curriculum has evolved to reflect a liberal arts emphasis. Today almost all Waldorf students intend to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree. In the spring of 1994, Waldorf College was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In January 2010, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America sold the college to a subsidiary of Columbia Southern University and it became a for-profit institution. Waldorf College became Waldorf University in March 2016. In 2022, the ownership of the college was transferred to the Waldorf Lutheran College Foundation and the university began the process of returning to nonprofit status.

<text>The Publicly Owned Enterprise (; abbreviated VEB) was the main legal form of industrial enterprise in East Germany. These state-owned enterprise were all publicly owned and were formed after mass nationalisation between 1945 and the early 1960s, and the handing back in 1954 of some 33 enterprises previously taken by the Soviet Union as reparations.

The managing director of a VEB was called a plant or works manager (, or ). They were assisted by the first secretary of the factory party organisation () of the SED, and the chairman of the factory trade union (). Subordinate to them were roles such as &quot;Chief Accountant&quot; and &quot;Technical Director&quot;.

VEBs were initially vertically integrated into units called Associations of Publicly Owned Enterprises (, VVBs). A VVB existed in most major industries to consolidate production and reduce waste. They had all been replaced by 1979 with the , or VEB Group, which integrated the VEBs much more closely than the largely administrative VVBs. Under this system, the term was frequently dropped and the term usually implied the group rather than the individual factory. The organisation of all state enterprises was the responsibility of the State Planning Commission.

VEBs often had company sports teams, and played an important role in the promotion of sports.

In 1989, VEBs employed 79.9% of the East German workforce. After German reunification and the introduction of the market economy in 1990, the ownership of around 8,000 publicly owned enterprises passed to , the trust agency which oversaw the privatization of GDR state property.

An honorary name was frequently added to the firm&#x27;s actual name, for example, . This was a socialist emulation incentive towards fulfillment and overfulfillment of production quotas. Many Germans, as a form of mild protest against the nationalization of private businesses, nicknamed the VEBs , which translates to &quot;Daddy&#x27;s former business&quot;.

<doc id="1097688" wikidata="Q5472378" url="?curid=1097688" title="Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport">
<text>Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport is a public airport north of the central business district of Fort Worth, Texas, United States. The airport is owned by the City of Fort Worth and managed by Alliance Air Services, a subsidiary of Hillwood Development, and is, in size, the second-largest airport facility in North Texas, behind only Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).

The airport is mainly focused on cargo operations, and serves as a southern regional hub for FedEx Express and focus city for Amazon Air. It provides no major commercial passenger airline service, though it does provide general aviation services. It formerly served as a maintenance hub for Fort Worth-based American Airlines, until the bankruptcy filing and subsequent restructuring of its parent AMR Corporation.

==History==
Billed as the world&#x27;s first purely industrial airport, it was developed in a joint venture between the City of Fort Worth, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Hillwood Development Company, a real estate development company owned by Ross Perot Jr.

The official groundbreaking ceremonies were held in July 1988, and the airport officially opened on .

Alliance Airport was an occasional source of friction between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth prior to the repeal of Wright Amendment, which imposed long-distance flight restrictions at Dallas Love Field after non-compete clauses in the 1968 DFW Concurrent Bond Ordinance signed by Dallas and Fort Worth failed to stop Southwest Airlines from beginning service from Love. The bond agreement prohibited both cities from offering municipal airport services that are &quot;potentially competitive&quot; with DFW. Fort Worth officials long asserted that, unlike Love Field, Alliance is not a direct competitor to DFW as no attempt was ever made to initiate passenger service there and the FedEx and American Airlines bases would never have been located at DFW, instead.

In the early 1990s, factions in Dallas were calling for Wright Amendment restrictions to be lifted to enhance local airline service. On , Dallas city leaders threatened to block a proposed million expansion of Alliance, accusing Fort Worth leaders of undermining support for other local airport projects; Dallas councilman Jerry Bartos, an influential repeal proponent, was accused of trying to make Alliance a negotiating point in his campaign to repeal the Wright Amendment. On February 25, Dallas leaders dropped their objections when it became clear that the planned expansion would not jeopardize federal funding for other local airport projects. On April 8, the city of Fort Worth sued the City of Dallas, accusing Dallas leaders of violating the non-compete clause by scheduling a City Council vote on the Wright Amendment. The 1992 repeal proposal and lawsuit were later dropped after negotiations between the cities, but it was revealed in 1997 that, during a private meeting held on , influential Fort Worth politicians and civic leaders were seriously concerned that their support for Alliance could give Dallas grounds to countersue Fort Worth for also violating the bond agreement.

In 1993, Russian flag carrier Aeroflot proposed opening a cargo base at Alliance as part of a proposed joint venture with the Perots to expand cargo operations at three airports in Russia. On , a group of Russian officials negotiating for the proposal arrived at Alliance in an Ilyushin Il-96, the first U.S. visit by the new passenger jet.

In 1998, the Wright Amendment issue resurfaced when Fort Worth and American Airlines sued Dallas, Continental Airlines, Continental Express, and Legend Airlines for supporting the Shelby Amendment, which lifted Wright Amendment restrictions on flights to Alabama, Kansas, and Mississippi. On , Legend countersued Fort Worth, accusing the city of a &quot;double standard&quot; in its simultaneous support for Alliance and opposition to expansion at Love. Lead Fort Worth attorney Lee Kelly contested the accusations, saying that &quot;neither passenger service, nor any other service, believed to be competitive with the services or interests of [DFW] currently exists [at Alliance],&quot; while Fort Worth mayor Kenneth Barr dismissed attacks on the all-cargo airport as &quot;a bunch of nonsense.&quot; On , State District Judge Bob McCoy dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that Legend was not a party to the 1968 DFW bond agreement and thus lacked standing to sue.

Alliance stood in for Los Angeles International Airport during the filming of the pilot episode of the short-lived 2004 TV drama &quot;LAX&quot;.

A million runway and taxiway extension project was completed in April 2018 to allow heavily loaded cargo aircraft to take off from either runway in hot and high Texas summer weather conditions and reach Europe unrefueled. The project had been under construction since 2003 and required the relocation of nearby sections of Farm to Market Road 156 and a BNSF Railway line. Runways 16R/34L and 16L/34R were previously and long, respectively.

In December, 2022, the airport name was changed to Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport in honor of Ross Perot, Sr.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Fort Worth Alliance Airport covers an area of and has two concrete runways: 16L/34R measuring and 16R/34L measuring .

For the year ending the airport had 109,652 aircraft operations, averaging 300 per day: 61% general aviation, 18% air carrier, 10% military, and 11% air taxi. there were 22 aircraft based at this airport: 1 single-engine, 5 multi-engine, 8 jet and 8 helicopter.

== Airlines and destinations ==
===Cargo===


==Major tenants==
American Airlines was previously the largest tenant at the airport, operating a major maintenance base which closed in December 2012 as part of AMR&#x27;s Chapter 11 reorganization. Current major tenants include:
* Amazon Air (new hub opened on )
* BNSF Railway (Alliance intermodal facility)
* Bell Helicopter Textron (customer acceptance center)
* Drug Enforcement Administration (aviation operations center)
* DynCorp International (main operations center)
* FedEx (southwest regional sorting hub; FedEx also operates from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport&#x27;s east cargo facility)
* GDC Technics (aircraft modification company currently occupying the ex-American Airlines facility)
*Tarrant County College – Aviation Learning Center (2014)
*Gulfstream Aerospace (Maintenance Service Center)
== Accidents and incidents ==
* : A student pilot in a Cessna 150, registration number &quot;N67816&quot;, became lost during a nighttime solo cross-country flight and initiated an emergency landing at Alliance when the aircraft began losing power; the aircraft struck power lines and a tree on approach, causing substantial aircraft damage and minor injuries. The accident was attributed to fuel exhaustion caused by the pilot&#x27;s failure to refuel the aircraft during an earlier stop; a factor was the pilot&#x27;s inadvertent disorientation.
* : A Piper PA-32, &quot;N8355L&quot;, was on approach when propeller RPM suddenly increased and engine instruments indicated zero oil pressure. The aircraft lost power and was substantially damaged during the subsequent off-airport forced landing; one pilot suffered serious injuries, while a second pilot and two passengers suffered minor injuries. The accident was attributed to the improper installation of engine oiling parts by unknown persons; a contributing factor was a lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.
* : The owner-pilot and a flight instructor in a Eurocopter AS350 Écureuil, &quot;N747CH&quot;, lost control during low-altitude practice maneuvers with the hydraulic assist for the flight controls switched off. The aircraft crashed and caught fire and all three occupants suffered minor injuries. Investigators found that Eurocopter advised against attempting low-altitude, low-speed maneuvers without hydraulic assistance. The accident was attributed to the pilot&#x27;s loss of control, and to inadequate supervision and delayed remedial response by the flight instructor.

<text>Randall Lee Gibson (September 10, 1832 – December 15, 1892) was an American attorney and politician, elected as a member of the House of Representatives and U.S. Senator from Louisiana. He served as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. Later he was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, and a president of the board of administrators of Tulane University.

==Early life==
Gibson was born in 1832 at &quot;Spring Hill&quot;, Versailles, Kentucky, the son of Tobias Gibson, a planter and slaveholder. His mother was from a slaveholding family in Lexington, Kentucky.

His paternal great-grandfather was Gideon Gibson Jr., who was likely born in the colony of South Carolina in 1731. His great-great-grandfather, Gideon Gibson, was a free man of color who was married to a white woman, and had owned land and a few slaves in Virginia (likely where he was born) and North Carolina, before migrating with other settlers to South Carolina in the 1730s. The government was worried that he might provoke a slave revolt and the colonial governor had an interview with him. Learning about his life, the governor declared him a free man with all privileges, and granted him land.

Gibson&#x27;s father moved his family to Louisiana when Randall was a child, where the youth was educated in local academies. He went to college in the North, graduating from Yale University in 1853, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones society. He returned to Louisiana to study for his bachelor of laws (LL.B) from the University of Louisiana Law School, later Tulane University.

==Civil War==

Soon after the Louisiana&#x27;s secession from the Union, Gibson became an aide to Gov. Thomas O. Moore. On May 8, 1861, he left Frankfort to join the 1st Louisiana Artillery as a captain.

On August 13, 1861, he was commissioned as colonel of the 13th Louisiana Infantry. Gibson fought at the Battle of Shiloh and subsequent actions. With the Army of the Mississippi, he took part in the 1862 Kentucky Campaign and the Battle of Chickamauga. After being promoted to brigadier general (special) on January 11, 1864, he fought in the Atlanta Campaign and the Franklin-Nashville Campaign; he next was assigned to the defense of Mobile, Alabama. He inspired his troops to hold Spanish Fort, which was under siege, until the last moment, after which they escaped at night on April 8, 1865. Gibson was captured at Cuba Station, Alabama on May 8, 1865 and paroled at Meridian, Mississippi on May 14, 1865. He was pardoned on September 25, 1866.

==Postbellum career==
In 1874, Gibson was elected as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives, being re-elected and serving from March 4, 1875, until March 3, 1883. He promoted the creation of the United States House Committee on the Mississippi Levees on December 10, 1875, to investigate the state of Mississippi levees and gain federal support for their building and repair, issues he persuaded his fellows were in the national interest because of the importance of the Mississippi, its trade, and the region&#x27;s agriculture. The committee&#x27;s name was changed to the Levees and Improvements of the Mississippi River on November 7, 1877.

In 1882, Gibson was elected by the Louisiana state legislature (as was the procedure at the time) as United States Senator, serving from March 4, 1883, until his death on December 15, 1892.

According to historian Daniel J. Sharfstein in &quot;The Invisible Line: Three American Families and the Secret Journey From Black to White&quot; (2011), during these years a political opponent challenged Gibson&#x27;s status as a white man, based on records. Gibson investigated but learned only that his ancestors were property owners, which was &quot;enough to satisfy most of Gibson&#x27;s contemporaries.&quot;

&quot;Such status,&quot; Sharfstein explains, &quot;could not mean anything but whiteness. ... As much as racial purity mattered to white Southerners, they had to circle the wagons around Randall Gibson. If someone of his position could not be secure in his race, then no one was safe.&quot;

Sharfstein claims that Gibson&#x27;s paternal line went back to freed African slaves in colonial Virginia.

Randall Gibson died as a United States senator while in Hot Springs, Arkansas. His body was returned to Kentucky, where he was buried at Lexington Cemetery in Lexington, Kentucky. He was a member of The Boston Club of New Orleans.

==In memoriam==
Gibson Hall on the campus of Tulane University is named for Senator Gibson, who was instrumental after the war in helping fund and continue the public University of Louisiana as the private Tulane University of Louisiana. The town of Tigerville in Terrebonne Parish was renamed Gibson, Louisiana in his honor.

<text>Sir Douglas Lorimer Kidd (born 12 September 1941) is a former New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1978 to 2002, representing the National Party. He served for three years as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

==Early life==

Kidd was born in Levin. From 1960 to 1964, he served in the New Zealand Army Territorial Force as a bombardier gunlayer. He later obtained a LLB from Victoria University of Wellington, and worked as a lawyer. He also had business interests in aquaculture, forestry, and wine making.

==Member of Parliament==




Kidd was first elected to Parliament in the 1978 election, becoming MP for . In the government of Jim Bolger, Kidd held a number of minor ministerial portfolios, including Fisheries, Energy and Labour. He held his Marlborough electorate until the 1996 election, when the electorate was abolished and most of its area incorporated into the new and larger electorate. Kidd came first in Kaikoura in 1996. In the following election he sought election as a list MP only. He was succeeded in Kaikoura by Lynda Scott and retired from Parliament at the 2002 election.

===Status of the Unborn Child Bill===
In 1983 Kidd&#x27;s anti-abortion Status of the Unborn Child Bill (a private members bill) was drawn from the lot. The bill was prompted by Wall v Livingston [1982], which clarified that embryos and foetuses had no legal status in New Zealand and that third parties could not appeal to the courts on their behalf. The bill was supported by groups such as Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (now Voice for Life and Right to Life New Zealand) but defeated by pro-choice groups led by Marilyn Waring.

===Speaker of the House===
After the 1996 election, Kidd was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives; Derek Quigley also contested the position. He replaced Peter Tapsell, a Labour Party MP who had held the speakership because National, which had won the election by a single seat, did not want to lose a vote by appointing a Speaker from its own ranks. Kidd lost the speakership when the National Party lost the 1999 election, being replaced by Jonathan Hunt of the Labour Party. After serving a term in Opposition, he chose to retire from politics at the 2002 election.

==After Parliament==
In the 2000 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Kidd was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as Speaker of the House of Representatives between 1996 and 1999, and he accepted redesignation as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in August 2009 following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government.

Kidd was appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal in 2004.

His 2008 book, &quot;The Forger&#x27;s Spell&quot;, describes the 1930-1940s forging of Johannes Vermeer paintings by a critic-detesting Dutch artist, accepted as &quot;masterpieces&quot; by art experts until the artist&#x27;s confession and trial in 1945.

<doc id="1097746" wikidata="Q3247884" url="?curid=1097746" title="Premier of the Cayman Islands">
<text>The Premier of the Cayman Islands is the political leader and head of government. The post of premier in the Cayman Islands is the equivalent to chief minister or prime minister in other British Overseas Territories. It is the highest political level that can be attained within the British overseas territory. Prior to 2009, the position was known as Leader of Government Business.

The premier and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior ministers) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to King Charles III, to the Parliament of the Cayman Islands, to their political party and ultimately to the electorate.

The premier earns a salary at Grade A5, the highest, in the Cayman Islands Civil Service Salary Scale, which was CI$239,604 per year (approx. US$287,641) as at 1 September 2022. The premier also receives an executive allowance of CI$5,000 per month, in addition to the constituency allowance of CI$5,000 paid to every MP. Total compensation for the position is therefore CI$359,604 (approx. US$431,700).

The current premier is Juliana O&#x27;Connor-Connolly, since 15 November 2023.

==Constitutional background==
Until 2003 the position had no official recognition, but it was formalized by a constitutional amendment in June 2003, as the Leader of Government Business along with the Leader of the Opposition. Further constitutional amendments in 2009 modified the name to Premier.

<doc id="1097757" wikidata="Q3180994" url="?curid=1097757" title="John Barbata">
<text>John Barbata (April 1, 1945 – May 8, 2024) was an American drummer who was active especially in pop and rock bands in the 1960s and 1970s, both as a band member and as a session drummer. Barbata served as the drummer for The Turtles, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Jefferson Airplane (for its final album and tour only), and Jefferson Starship (from 1974 to 1978). Barbata claimed to have played on over 60 albums in an uncredited capacity.

==Early life==

Barbata was born on Easter, April 1, 1945, in Passaic, New Jersey, to Martina and Charles Barbata. He was raised in Saranac Lake, New York, till the age of seven and later in Nutley, New Jersey. His mother was an Austrian emigrant who worked as a records keeper at a hospital and his father was a firefighter and mechanic. He was the youngest child of three, preceded by his older brother Chuck and sister Lauren. His first claim to fame came to him as a young infant when his mother found a man stranded in a boat that had run out of gas. The man was Albert Einstein, who held the child as Barbata&#x27;s mother delivered them to shore.

Barbata&#x27;s interest in percussion began by watching his older brother drum in the marching band. After expressing interest in drums, his brother took him to a friend&#x27;s house where Barbata played on his first trap set. The first song he ever learned to play was &quot;Put Another Nickel In&quot; by Teresa Brewer.

==The Sentinals (1961–1965)==
At the age of 16, Barbata&#x27;s family relocated for a brief stint to Rialto, California, where Barbata formed his first band called the Velvatones. Soon after the family moved to San Luis Obispo, California, where Barbata went to high school and followed in his older brother&#x27;s footsteps and joined the marching band. The rudimentary rhythms and beats from Barbata&#x27;s time in drum line heavily influenced his technique in later years. He soon went on to help form a band called the Ambassadors and bought his first set of drums. After playing gigs every weekend for six months, Barbata was approached by an instrumental surf rock group called the Sentinals to play drums. The Sentinals toured all over the country with acts such as The Righteous Brothers and released the album &quot;Big Surf!&quot; which produced a No. 1 West Coast surf hit called &quot;Latin&#x27;ia&quot;.

After five years with the Sentinals, the band broke up, and Barbata, along with his bandmate Lee Michaels, headed to Hollywood. Shortly after, Barbata joined Joel Scott Hill of Canned Heat, after his drummer left and went on to play with the Mamas and Papas. Joel, Barbata, and Chris Ethridge later went on to put out the album &quot;L.A. Getaway&quot; in 1971.

==The Turtles (1966–1969)==

In spring 1966, The Turtles were looking for a new drummer and Gene Clark of the Byrds recommended Barbata. After an audition with Howard Kaylan, Mark Volman, and Al Nichol, Barbata had the gig. The first song Barbata recorded with the Turtles was &quot;Outside Chance&quot; in July 1966. Barbata played on the Turtles&#x27; biggest US hit Happy Together which, on March 25, 1967, went to No. 1 on the charts and stayed there for three weeks. One of his trademarks was to incorporate stick twirling into his performances, a technique also used by Dino Danelli of The Rascals and Carmine Appice of Vanilla Fudge.

The Turtles were invited to play on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (May 14, 1967), &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;, and &quot;The Johnny Carson Show&quot;. The group went on to have many other hits with Barbata, including &quot;She&#x27;d Rather Be with Me&quot;, &quot;You Showed Me&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s My Girl&quot;, and &quot;Elenore&quot;. Barbata also appeared on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; show.

==Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (1970–1972)==
In 1970, Barbata was invited to join CSNY after Neil Young fired their previous drummer, Dallas Taylor. They soon after recorded the live album &quot;4 Way Street&quot;, which went to #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Included on the album was the protest song &quot;Ohio&quot;, about the Kent State shootings. Barbata continued to play on eight albums with CSNY and the individual members of the quartet, including Graham Nash&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Beginners&quot; and &quot;Wild Tales&quot;, Graham Nash and David Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Graham Nash David Crosby&quot;, Stephen Stills&#x27; &quot;Stephen Stills&quot; album, and filling in for Kenny Buttrey with The Stray Gators on Neil Young&#x27;s live album &quot;Time Fades Away&quot;.

While Barbata was drumming with CSNY, David Geffen tried to persuade him to join The Eagles. Barbata declined as he was already in one of the biggest musical groups at the time.

==Jefferson Airplane &amp; Jefferson Starship (1972–1978)==

In 1972, while CSNY were on an extended break, David Crosby introduced Barbata to the band Jefferson Airplane, who were looking for a new drummer after their previous one, Joey Covington, quit to do a solo album. Soon after, Barbata joined Jefferson Airplane and went on to record the album &quot;Long John Silver&quot; (1972) and the live album &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Winterland&quot; (1973).

When members Jorma Kaukonen (guitarist) and Jack Casady (bassist) left to pursue their band Hot Tuna, the band reformed into Jefferson Starship, adding new members Craig Chaquico and Peter Kaukonen. Their debut album together was &quot;Dragon Fly&quot; (1974). Barbata later went on to play on &quot;Red Octopus&quot; (1975), which was the Starship&#x27;s best-selling album, containing the hit single &quot;Miracles&quot;. In 1976, they released the album &quot;Spitfire&quot; and in 1978 they released &quot;Earth&quot;. Jefferson Starship appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1978. They also performed as the unnamed band in the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978).

In October 1978, Barbata was in a serious car crash in Northern California that broke his neck, arm and jaw. The injuries took over a year to recover, and forced him to resign from Jefferson Starship.

Reflecting on his career, Barbata later said &quot;I was very fortunate ... Most drummers only go around once. I went around three times and played with the best musicians in the world.”

== Personal life ==
At the age of 33, Barbata retired from the mainstream music industry and built a house and recording studio in the remote redwood village of Comptche, California. He continued making music locally. On July 3, 1981, Barbata married the Oklahoma native and artist, Angela Evans (1961–2016). They released two albums together, &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. In 1987, their daughter Leah was born. They later relocated to his late wife&#x27;s hometown of Ada, Oklahoma, where Barbata resided up to his death. In 2016, after 34 years of marriage, his wife died from cancer. Barbata continued to play music, often performing with former band members or his singer-songwriter daughter.

Barbata died on May 8, 2024 of heart complications, at the age of 79.

<text>Brian Kevin Neeson (born 30 September 1945) is a New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1990 to 2002, representing the National Party, and a member of the Waitematā District Health Board from 2004 to 2010.

==Early life==
Neeson was born in Durban, South Africa, and moved to New Zealand when he was six years old. He worked in a number of jobs, having owned a restaurant and retail meat business and worked as a real estate consultant and property developer. He later managed a private investment company.

==Political career==


Neeson represented a number of West Auckland electorates in his career, with frequent boundary changes meaning that he never ran in any electorate as an incumbent. He was first elected to Parliament in the 1990 election as MP for the Te Atatu seat, and in the 1993 election, he successfully contested the Waitakere seat. In the 1996 election, he successfully contested the Waipareira seat, and in the 1999 election, he contested the Waitakere seat once again. From age 38, he had lived in a house in West Harbour and he always stood in the electorate that his house was located in.

In the 2002 election, he sought the National Party nomination for the new seat of Helensville, which had absorbed most of the Waitakere electorate. However, he was controversially defeated for selection by John Key, a new candidate. Neeson considered his non-selection to be a betrayal, believing that National Party president Michelle Boag had deliberately engineered his defeat in order to further her &quot;rejuvenation&quot; of the party. Neeson quit the National Party and stood as an independent, but placed third.

==After parliament==
In December 2009 Neeson was appointed to the Human Rights Review Tribunal. The appointment was criticised by the gay community and by Labour MP Grant Robertson due to Neeson&#x27;s record of voting against gay rights while an MP.

In 2010 Neeson was elected to the Upper Harbour Local Board of the new Auckland Council, as well as the Waitakere Licensing Trust. He also ran for the Auckland Council, placing 10th in the Albany ward with 4,911 votes.

At the 2016 Auckland elections, Neeson was elected to the Upper Harbour Local Board and the Waitematā District Health Board.

<doc id="1097763" wikidata="Q17146917" url="?curid=1097763" title="Japanning">
<text>Japanning is a type of finish that originated as a European imitation of East Asian lacquerwork. It was first used on furniture, but was later much used on small items in metal. The word originated in the 17th century. American work, except in the carriage and early automobile industries, is more often called toleware.

It is distinct from true East Asian lacquer, which is made by coating objects with a preparation based on the dried sap of the &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot; tree, which was not available in Europe. 

Japanning is most often a heavy black lacquer, almost like enamel paint. Black is common, and japanning is often synonymous with black japanning. The European technique uses varnishes that have a resin base, similar to shellac, applied in heat-dried layers which are then polished, to give a smooth glossy finish. It can also come in reds, greens and blues.

Originating in India, China and Japan as a decorative coating for pottery, authentic East Asian lacquered ware made its way into Europe by the 17th century. In the late 17th century, high European demand (along with rumors that East Asian manufacturers reserved their higher-quality work for their domestic markets) led to the production of imitation pieces starting in Italy. Its traditional form used gold designs and pictorials to contrast with the black base colour.

==Development in Europe==
As the demand for japanned goods grew, the Italian technique for imitating Asian lacquerwork also spread. The art of japanning developed in seventeenth-century Britain, France, Italy, and the Low Countries. The technique was described in design and pattern manuals such as Stalker and Parker&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing&quot;, published in Oxford in 1688. Colonial Boston was a major center of the japanning trade in America, where at least a dozen cabinetmakers included it among their specialties. In England, decoupage, the art of applying paper cutouts to other items, became very popular, especially the botanically inspired works of Mary Delany.

A large amount of early amateur japanning can be attributed to the rise of the artform as a suitable pastime for young ladies between the late 17th and 18th century. Molly Verney is noted as one of these early adopters of the craft which was subsequently taught in London, but a number of pattern books such as &quot;Art&#x27;s Master-piece. OR, A Companion for the Ingenious of either Sex&quot; (1697), &quot;The Art of Japanning: Varnishing, Pollishing, and Gilding ... Published at the Request of Several Ladies of Distinction&quot; by Mrs. Artlove (1730), &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Delight, or Accomplished Female Instructor&quot; (1741), &quot;Study and Practise the Noble and Commendable Art of Drawing, Colouring and Japanning ... with Plain and Easy Rules for the Ladies Japanning&quot; (1751), &quot;The Ladies Amusement or, Whole Art of Japanning Made Easy&quot; (1758, 1762 &amp; 1771), &amp; &quot;The Young Ladies School of Arts&quot; by Hannah Robertson (1766) were all aimed at a female audience, and some of which were also written by female authors. Certainly by 1710, &quot;japanning&quot; was regarded by many including Alexander Pope as a feminine pastime. These mock lacquerware techniques were often suggested to be applied to textiles, and by the 18th century are found on cabinets, tea-trays, powderboxes, drawers, and large flat English household furniture in the manors and houses of the landed gentry. 
Drawing on the grotesque forms derived from travellers accounts and artwork from the &quot;Indies&quot; these conflated forms went so far from the source material, they can said to be an early form of Japonaiserie in the UK. Popular motifs included landscapes containing &#x27;woods, cottages, rivers, trees, hills, sun, moon [&amp;] stars&#x27;. Other popular adopters included the wife of Robert Walpole, Lady Catherine Walpole in 1732. One of her &#x27;japanned cabinets&#x27; was bought and displayed in the Blue bedroom by Horace Walpole in his Strawberry Hill House. The popularity of japanning continued to be seen as a womanly pursuit until 1760, by which point it began to become a commercial trade in the UK. 
Today, japanning exists primarily as a conservation craft – it so extremely rare to make it for new items so it is taught from a conservation/restoration approach for example as part of the City &amp; Guilds three-year Conservation course and Painter Stainers Decorative Surface Fellowship.
===Wolverhampton and Bilston===

Wolverhampton and Bilston were important centres for the manufacture of japanned ware. Trade directories for 1818 list 20 firms of japanners in Wolverhampton and 15 in Bilston. According to Samuel Timmins&#x27; book &quot;Birmingham and the Midland Hardware District&quot;, published in 1866, there were 2000 people employed in the japanning and tin-plate industries in Wolverhampton and Bilston at the time. Japanning firms ranged in size from small family workshops, which often adjoined the proprietor&#x27;s home, to a few large factories employing over 250 people. In the larger workshops, the production of tin plate and papier-mâché articles and the japanning process all took place under one roof, while small workshops tended to carry out only one or two of the trades, usually tin-plate working and japanning.

At the height of its popularity, richly decorated japanned ware was to be seen in every middle-class home, but from the mid-19th century, this began to change. By the 1880s, the japanning and tin-plate industries were in decline. This was due partly to changes in fashion and taste and partly due to the development of electroplating. In response, makers of japanned ware began to focus on more utilitarian items, including japanned cash boxes. Many turned to other trades, including enamelling, electroplating and the manufacture of copper and brass coal scuttles, fire screens and kettles. By the 1920s, the West Midlands&#x27; decorative japanned ware industry had largely died out. Many firms began to supply japanned metal to the newly established bicycle and motor vehicle industries, and some even made their own bicycles. The most successful of these was John Marston, whose japanning factory began making bicycles in 1887. The bicycle manufacturing part of the business quickly became more successful than the production of decorative japanned ware. Marston&#x27;s wife thought the gilt on the black japanned bicycles looked like sunbeams and the bicycles were branded Sunbeam and their factory was named Sunbeamland.

== Japanned metal ==

Ironware was japanned black for decorative reasons. It was also used to render it rustproof, suitable for carrying water. A significant industry developed at Pontypool and Usk in South Wales, shortly before tinplate began to be made in the area. Japanned ware was being also made at Bilston, England by 1719 and later elsewhere in the area.

==Applications==
The technique was also developed to protect metal objects such as sewing machines, hand planes, builders&#x27; hardware, and in North America, electricity meters made before the mid-1930s. Later, it was used as an insulating film on transformer laminations. 

Japanned sheets were also used as the dark substrate for the tintype photographic process.

<text>Lake Poteriteri is the southernmost of the large lakes in Fiordland National Park in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Only Lakes Hakapoua and Innes lie further south on the southern of New Zealand&#x27;s two main islands. It is located to the west of the town of Tuatapere.

Lying in a steep-sided mountain valley, Poteriteri runs roughly north–south for a distance of with an average width of under . It covers an area of . The outflow of Poteriteri is the Waitutu River, a short river which flows into the western end of Foveaux Strait.

The naming of the lake is unclear. The Māori word may mean &#x27;to drift forwards and backwards&#x27;, with another theory that the spelling of the lake should be Poutiritiri, which would translate as a &#x27;post on which offerings are hung&#x27;. A third theory is that the spelling should be Poeteretere, in which case it would mean &#x27;dripping wet&#x27;.

Access to the lake is via helicopter, a rough deer trail from Slaughter Burn or Harry&#x27;s Track, a marked route from the outlet of Lake Hauroko.

<doc id="1097782" wikidata="Q129282" url="?curid=1097782" title="Karasuk culture">
<text>The Karasuk culture () describes a group of late Bronze Age societies who ranged from the Aral Sea to the upper Yenisei in the east and south to the Altai Mountains and the Tian Shan in ca. 1500–800 BC.

==Overview==

The distribution of the Karasuk culture covers the eastern parts of the Andronovo culture, which it appears to replace. It is considered that the Karasuk culture primarily formed out of the Andronovo culture with influences from the Okunevo culture.

The remains of settlements are minimal, and entirely of the mortuary variety. At least 2000 burials are known. The Karasuk period persisted down to c. 700 BC. From c. 700 to c. 200 BC, culture developed along similar lines. Vital trade contact is traced from northern China and the Baikal region to the Black Sea and the Urals, influencing the uniformity of the culture. The Karasuk was succeeded by the Tagar culture.
The economy was mixed agriculture and stockbreeding. Its culture appears to have been more mobile than the Andronovo. The Karasuk were farmers who practiced metallurgy on a large scale. Arsenical bronze artefacts are present. Their settlements were of pit houses and they buried their dead in stone cists covered by kurgans and surrounded by square stone enclosures. Industrially, they were skilled metalworkers, the diagnostic artifacts of the culture being a bronze knife with curving profiles and a decorated handle and horse bridles. The pottery has been compared to that discovered in Inner Mongolia and the interior of China, with burials bronze knives similar to those from northeastern China. Their realistic animal art probably contributed to the development of the Scytho-Siberian animal art style (Scythian art).

The origins of the Karasuk culture are complex, but it is generally accepted that its origins lie both with the Andronovo culture and local cultures of the Yenisei. The ethnic identity of the Karasuk is problematic, as the Andronovo culture has been associated with the Indo-Iranians while the local cultures have been considered as unconnected to the steppe. Nevertheless, a specifically Proto-Iranian identity has been proposed for the Karasuk culture. The Karasuk tribes have been described by archaeologists as exhibiting pronounced Caucasoid/Europoid features. George van Driem has suggested a connection with the Yeniseian and Burushaski people, proposing a Karasuk languages group.

The contemporary Deer stones culture to the southeast may have been built in part by nomads from the Karasuk culture.

==Chariots==
The Karasuk culture had horse-drawn spoke-wheeled chariots, a technology first attested in the Sintashta culture (c. 2000 BC) which spread eastwards with the Andronovo culture. Although no Karasuk chariots have been found, their existence is indicated by petroglyph drawings, chariot equipment, horse bridles and &#x27;charioteer burials&#x27;. These have close similarities to chariots and equipment from the Shang dynasty in China (c. 1200 BC), such as the use of wheels with numerous spokes and bow-shaped rein holders. Both Karasuk and Shang chariots also have close similarities to chariots from Lchashen in Armenia, dating from c. 1500 BC. According to Wu (2013) Shang chariots and their associated equipment originated from the Karasuk culture and can be understood as &quot;a local version of the Karasuk set.&quot;

==Metallurgy==

The metallurgy of the Karasuk culture may have derived from the earlier Seima-Turbino tradition. It expanded on this tradition, and became the core of a regional hub in metallurgy, sometimes called the &quot;East Asian Metallurgical Province&quot;.

Seima-Turbino had a westward expansion, encountering the Abashevo and Sintashta cultures during the 2200-1700 BCE period. On the contrary, the expansion of the Karasuk metallurgical culture was eastward. Karasuk styles were copied throughout Central and Eastern Asia, reaching China where numerous bronze objects on the Karasuk model have been excavated. In particular the royal complex of the Anyang Cemetery from the 13-11th centuries BCE during the Shang dynasty period is known for numerous such imitations.

It is thought that these metallurgical innovations from the Karasuk culture were transmitted by steppe nomads, within a context of rather conflictual relations between China and its northern neighbours. The Shang mainly imitated the curved one-edged knives with animal handles, and placed them in their tombs among other bronze paraphernalia. Altogether, these influences travelled over a distance of more than 3,500 kilometers, from the Sayan-Altai region to the heart of ancient China beyond the Yellow River.

Weapons of the contemporary Deer stones culture, as seen in their petroglyphs, are generally derived from those of the Karasuk culture, and belong to the Karasuk typology.

===Comparisons of Karasuk and Chinese Shang-Zhou blades===

Many bronze blades of the Shang dynasty (13th-11th centuries BCE) and Zhou dynasty were derived from Karasuk designs.
==Genetics==

Keyser et al. (2009) published a genetic study of ancient Siberian cultures, the Andronovo culture, the Karasuk culture, the Tagar culture and the Tashtyk culture. They surveyed four individuals of the Karasuk culture of four different sites from 1400 BC to 800 BC.
Two of these possessed the Western Eurasian mtDNA U5a1 and U4 lineages. Two other ones exhibited the Y-chromosome haplogroup R1a1, which is thought to mark the eastward migration of the early Indo-Europeans. The individuals surveyed were all determined to be Europoid and light-eyed. In a study by Allentoft et al. (2015) three of four male Karasuk samples were found to have the Y-chromosome haplogroup R1a1 whilst one had Q1a2a.

==Sites==
Sites are not numerous, and are mainly found southwest of the Minusinsk basin. They consist in semi-subterranean houses and larger winter houses about 100-200 m2 in area, with domed or pitched roofs covered with earth to protect against the cold.

<text>:&quot;Edah, should not be confused with the Haredi communal body in Israel known as the Edah HaChareidis.&quot;

Edah was a Modern Orthodox Jewish organization, generally associated with the liberal wing of Orthodox Judaism in the United States and with the Religious Zionism movement of Israel. Its headquarters were located in Manhattan, New York City. 

Edah&#x27;s motto was The Challenge to be Modern and Orthodox”.

==Opening==
Edah was founded in 1997 in response to what its founding director, Rabbi Saul Berman, called &quot;the separatist trend in Modern Orthodoxy.&quot; It promised in its mission statement to &quot;give voice to the ideology and values of modern Orthodoxy and to educate and empower the community to address its concerns.&quot;

Edah organized conferences, fellowships, and adult education programs, primarily in the New York metropolitan area, and to a lesser extent around the world. It also published the &quot;Edah Journal&quot;, an academic journal on Modern Orthodoxy and contemporary issues in the religious community.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Yeshiva University&#x27;s biology department chairman, an ordained rabbi, &quot;denounced Edah as &#x27;outside the pale of Judaism&#x27;.&quot;

==Closing==
In July 2006, Edah announced plans to close down its operations as a stand-alone entity. In a news release, leaders of the organization claimed that it had made significant achievements, but given limited financial resources available, a tactical decision was made so that its goals would be able to continue through other means.

After winding down operations, Berman took on an administrative position at Yeshivat Chovevei Torah (YCT), an Open Orthodox rabbinical school in New York City. YCT also assumed Edah’s journal, website, and audio-visual library.

The &quot;Edah Journal&quot; was rebranded as &quot;Meorot: A Forum of Modern Orthodox Discourse&quot; and its publication continued by YCT.

<doc id="1097790" wikidata="Q983034" url="?curid=1097790" title="Sultan Ali Keshtmand">
<text>Sultan Ali Keshtmand (; born May 22, 1935, in Kabul), sometimes transliterated Kishtmand, was an Afghan communist politician, belonging to the Parcham faction of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). He served twice as Chairman of the Council of Ministers during the 1980s, from 1981 to 1988 and from 1989 to 1990 in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.

==Early years==
Keshtmand was born in Kabul. He is a member of the Hazara ethnic group. He studied economics at Kabul University and became involved in the PDPA. He joined the Parcham faction of that party, which was led by Babrak Karmal. He sought and received political asylum from British Prime Minister John Major. He lives in the UK.

==Role in politics==
Immediately after the April 1978 coup d&#x27;état in which the PDPA came to power, Keshtmand became the minister of planning in the newly formed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.

He lost that post in August 1978 when he was arrested for an alleged plot against President Nur Mohammad Taraki, a member of the rival Khalq faction of the party. The PDPA Politburo ordered the arrest of Keshtmand and Public Works Minister Muhammad Rafi&#x27;i for their part in the possible anti-regime conspiracy. He and the other inmates went through severe torture and long imprisonment. He remained in prison and was sentenced to death, but this decision was revoked and he was resentenced to 15 years in prison.

In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, bringing Babrak Karmal and the Parcham faction to power. Keshtmand was released from jail, and once again joined the Politburo.

Friction among the People&#x27;s Party members rose in 1980 when Karmal removed Assadullah Sarwari from his position as First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and replaced him with Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Keshtmand, a Parchami, soon became one of the most important leaders of the regime. In June 1981, Karmal retained his other offices, but resigned as Council of Ministers chairman and was succeeded by Keshtmand. A 21-member Supreme Defense Council headed by Mohammad Najibullah effectively assumed power.

The rise in the deficit greatly concerned the government, and as Council of Ministers chairman Keshtmand noted in April 1983, the tax collections were inadequate in view of the increased state spending. The security situation in the country, however, prevented the government from improving its tax collections.

In September 1987, the Kabul government sponsored a large convocation of Hazaras from various parts of the country and offered them autonomy. In his speech to the group, Keshtmand said that the government was going to set up several new provinces in the Hazarajat that would be administered by the local inhabitants.

==Rise and fall of power==
He served as Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1981 to 1988 and 1989 to 1990, and as one of the vice presidents from May 1990 until April 1991, when he was dismissed shortly before the fall of the government.

A mujaheddin radio station reports intra-Parcham (a faction of the PDPA) (P) clashes in Kabul between supporters of Najibullah and Keshtmand, chairman of the executive committee of the Council of Ministers.

Non-PDPA member Mohammad Hassan Sharq was selected by President Najibullah to be the new Council of Ministers chairman, replacing Keshtmand. This move was made in order to free spaces in the new government for nonparty candidates.

He then left Afghanistan, first moving to Russia and then to England. There he became an outspoken defender of the rights of Hazaras and other minorities, claiming that the Pashtun majority in Afghanistan had had too much power in all of Afghanistan&#x27;s regimes, past and present. After the communist Saur Revolution, which toppled Daud Khan&#x27;s first Afghan Republic, he reportedly said, &quot;Brothers, today the five long centuries of Pashtun political domination has come to an end.&quot;

<doc id="1097802" wikidata="Q3019031" url="?curid=1097802" title="Northland green gecko">
<text>The Northland green gecko (Naultinus grayii), also known commonly as Gray&#x27;s tree gecko is a species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is found only in the Northland region of New Zealand, north of Whangaroa, and is one of the rarest and most highly sought after lizards.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Naultinus grayii&quot; was originally described by Thomas Bell in 1843.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;grayii&quot;, is in honour of British herpetologist John Edward Gray.

==Habitat==
The preferred natural habitats of &quot;N. grayii&quot; are freshwater wetlands, shrubland, and forest.

==Description==

The Northland green gecko is vivid green with grey or gold-coloured markings on either side along the dorsal surface. Males have a blue band along the sides just below the limbs. Underneath, the ventral surface of both sexes is bright pale green, sometimes with a yellow tinge. The inside of the mouth is deep blue with a bright red tongue.

Its total length (including tail) is up to , and its snout-to-vent length (SVL) is up to .

==Behaviour==
The Northland green gecko is diurnal, often found sun-basking. It has an arboreal lifestyle, especially favouring stands of manuka, kanuka, and mingimingi.

==Reproduction==
&quot;N. grayii&quot; is oviparous. Average litter size is two newborns. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately two years, after which reproduction occurs annually. The young are born in March, after a gestation period of four months.

==Conservation status==
In 2012 the Department of Conservation classified the Northland green gecko as &quot;At Risk&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. It was judged as meeting the criteria for &quot;At Risk&quot; threat status as a result of it having a low to high ongoing or predicted decline. This gecko is also regarded as being &quot;Data Poor&quot;.

==Captivity==
The species &quot;N. grayii&quot;, like all the &quot;Naultinus&quot; species, is regarded as the &quot;holy grail&quot; of geckos among their keepers, often going for a large amount of money for a pair of lizards. Outside of its home range, it is most commonly kept in Europe where there are several keepers producing offspring, though still extremely rarely seen.

In 2001 a German tourist was fined $12,000 for attempting to smuggle Northland green geckos out of the country in his underwear.

<text>The Andronovo culture is a collection of similar local Late Bronze Age cultures that flourished  2000–1150 BC, spanning from the southern Urals to the upper Yenisei River in central Siberia and western Xinjiang in the east. In the south, the Andronovo sites reached Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. It is agreed among scholars that the Andronovo culture was Indo-Iranian. Some researchers have preferred to term it an archaeological complex or archaeological horizon. 

Andronovo culture&#x27;s first stage could have begun at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, with cattle grazing, as natural fodder was by no means difficult to find in the pastures close to dwellings. The slightly older Sintashta culture ( 2200–1900 BC), formerly included within the Andronovo culture, is now considered separately to Early Andronovo cultures. Allentoft et al. (2015) concluded from their genetic studies that the Andronovo culture and the preceding Sintashta culture were derived from an eastern migration of the Corded Ware culture, given the higher proportion of ancestry matching the earlier farmers of Europe, similar to the admixture found in the genomes of the Corded Ware population.

==Discovery==
The name derives from the village of Andronovo in the Uzhursky District of Kranoyarsk Krai, Siberia, where the Russian zoologist Arkadi Tugarinov discovered its first remains in 1914. Several graves were discovered, with skeletons in crouched positions, buried with richly decorated pottery. The Andronovo culture was first identified by the Russian archaeologist Sergei Teploukhov in the 1920s.

==Dating and subcultures==
The culture of Sarazm (4th–3rd millennium BC) precedes the arrival of the Andronovo steppe culture in South Central Asia in the 2nd millennium BC.

Currently only two sub-cultures are considered as part of Andronovo culture:

*Alakul (1900–1500 BC) In the Forest steppe and steppe of the Trans-Urals; northern, western, and central Kazakhstan; western Siberia; reaching southern Central Asia. In Transoxiana region, and Kyzylkum Desert.
*Fëdorovo (1900–1300 BC) At Forest steppe in Trans-Urals; Southern Siberia and Upper Yenissei; northern, central, and eastern Kazakhstan; Semirech&#x27;ye region; the Pamir and Tian Shan Mountains; and Xinjiang. In southern Siberia (earliest evidence of cremation and fire cult)
*Alakul-Fëdorovo (1750–1550 BC). On the other hand, synchronous Alakul-Fedorovo sites mainly appeared in the second quarter of the second millennium BC, in Southern Urals, along with the persistence of the Alakul materials.

Other authors identify the following sub-culture also as part of Andronovo:

*Alekseyevka-Sargary (1500–900 BC) Late Bronze Age in northern Kazakhstan, contacts with Namazga VI in Turkmenia, Ingala Valley in the south of Tyumen Oblast, in Tobol.

Some authors have challenged the chronology and model of eastward spread due to increasing evidence for the earlier presence of these cultural features in parts of east Central Asia.

==Geographic extent==

The geographical extent of the culture is vast and difficult to delineate exactly. On its western fringes, it overlaps with the approximately contemporaneous, but distinct, Srubna culture in the Volga-Ural interfluvial. To the east, it reaches into the Minusinsk depression, with some sites as far west as the southern Ural Mountains, overlapping with the area of the earlier Afanasevo culture. Additional sites are scattered as far south as the Kopet Dag (Turkmenistan), the Pamir (Tajikistan) and the Tian Shan (Kyrgyzstan). The northern boundary vaguely corresponds to the beginning of the Taiga. More recently, evidence for the presence of the culture in Xinjiang in far-western China has also been found, mainly concentrated in the area comprising Tashkurgan, Ili, Bortala, and Tacheng area. In the Volga basin, interaction with the Srubna culture was the most intense and prolonged, and Federovo style pottery is found as far west as Volgograd. Mallory notes that the Tazabagyab culture south of Andronovo could be an offshoot of the former (or Srubna), alternatively the result of an amalgamation of steppe cultures and the Central Asian oasis cultures (Bishkent culture and Vakhsh culture).

In the initial Sintashta-Petrovka phase, the Andronovo culture is limited to the northern and western steppes in the southern Urals-Kazakhstan. Since then, at the 2nd millennium, in the Alakul Phase (2000–1700 BC), the Fedorovo Phase (1850–1450 BC) and the final Alekseyevka Phase (1400–1000 BC), the Andronovo cultures move intensively eastwards, expanding as far east as the Upper Yenisei River, succeeding the non-Indo-European Okunev culture.

In southern Siberia and Kazakhstan, the Andronovo culture was succeeded by the Karasuk culture (1500–800 BC). On its western border, it is roughly contemporaneous with the Srubna culture, which partly derives from the Abashevo culture. The earliest historical peoples associated with the area are the Cimmerians and Saka/Scythians, appearing in Assyrian records after the decline of the Alekseyevka culture, migrating into Ukraine from ca. the 9th century BC (see also Ukrainian stone stela), and across the Caucasus into Anatolia and Assyria in the late 8th century BC, and possibly also west into Europe as the Thracians (see Thraco-Cimmerian), and the Sigynnae, located by Herodotus beyond the Danube, north of the Thracians, and by Strabo near the Caspian Sea. Both Herodotus and Strabo identify them as Iranian.

==Characteristics==
The Andronovo culture comprised both highly mobile communities and settled villages, with a notable concentration of settlements in its Central Asian regions. Fortifications include ditches, earthen banks as well as timber palisades, of which an estimated twenty have been discovered. Andronovo villages typically contain around two to twenty houses, but settlements containing as many as a hundred houses have been discovered. Andronovo houses were generally constructed from pine, cedar, or birch, and were usually aligned overlooking the banks of rivers. Larger homes range in the size from 80 to 300 m2, and probably belonged to extended families, a typical feature among early Indo-Iranians. Soma may have originated in the Andronovo culture.

===Livestock, horse, and agriculture===

Andronovo livestock included cattle, horses, sheep, goats and camels. The domestic pig is notably absent, which is typical of a mobile economy. The percentage of cattle among Andronovo remains are significantly higher than among their western Srubna neighbours. The horse was represented on Andronovo sites and was used for both riding and traction. According to the Journal of Archaeological Science, in July 2020, scientists from South Ural State University studied two Late Bronze Age horses with the aid of radiocarbon dating from Kurgan 5 of the Novoilinovsky 2 cemetery in the Lisakovsk city in the Kostanay region. Researcher Igor Chechushkov, indicated that the Andronovites had an ability on horse riding several centuries earlier than many researchers had previously expected. Among the horses investigated, the stallion was nearly 20 years old and the mare was 18 years old. According to scientists, animals were buried with the person they accompanied throughout their lives, and they were used not only for food, but also for harnessing to vehicles and riding. Agriculture did not play an important role in the Andronovo economy.

===Metallurgy===
The Andronovo culture is notable for regional advances in metallurgy. They mined deposits of copper ore in the Altai Mountains from around the 14th century BC. Bronze objects were numerous, and workshops existed for working copper.

===Pottery===

One of the characteristics of Andronovo culture is its pottery, especially in campsites located in Central Asia, some of them very close to settlements of Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex in the south. This pottery is called Incised Coarse Ware (ICW), which is handmade and grey to brown in color, as well as incised with geometrical decoration, spread over much of Eurasian region, from Southern Urals to Kashgar, a pottery made by late Bronze Age nomads.

===Warfare===
&quot;It is likely that militarized elite, whose power was based on the physical control of fellow tribesmen and neighbors with the help of riding and fighting skills, was buried in the Novoilinovsky-2 burial ground. The rider has a significant advantage over the infantryman. There may be another explanation: These elite fulfilled the function of mediating conflicts within the collective, and therefore had power and high social status. Metaphorically, this kind of elite can be called Sheriffs of the Bronze Age&quot; said Igor Chechushkov.

===Burials===
The Andronovo dead were buried in timber or stone chambers under both round and rectangular kurgans (tumuli). Burials were accompanied by livestock, wheeled vehicles, cheek-pieces for horses, and weapons, ceramics and ornaments. Among the most notable remains are the burials of chariots, dating from around 2000 BC and possibly earlier. The chariots are found with paired horse-teams, and the ritual burial of the horse in a &quot;head and hooves&quot; cult has also been found. Some Andronovo dead were buried in pairs, of adults or adult and child.

At Kytmanovo in Russia between Mongolia and Kazakhstan, dated 1746–1626 BC, a strain of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; was extracted from a dead woman&#x27;s tooth in a grave common to her and to two children. This strain&#x27;s genes express flagellin, which triggers the human immune response. However, by contrast with other prehistoric &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; bacteria, the strain does so weakly; later, historic plague does not express flagellin at all, accounting for its virulence. The Kytmanovo strain was therefore under selection toward becoming a plague (although it was not &quot;the&quot; plague). The three people in that grave all died at the same time, and the researcher believes that this para-plague is what killed them.

==Ethnolinguistic affiliation with Indo-Iranians==

Most researchers associate the Andronovo horizon with early Indo-Iranian languages. It is credited with the invention of the spoke-wheeled chariot around 2000 BC, if we include the Sintashta culture, where the oldest known chariots have been found. The association between the Andronovo culture and the Indo-Iranians is corroborated by the distribution of Iranian place-names across the Andronovo horizon and by the historical evidence of dominance by various Iranian-speaking peoples, including the Saka (Scythians), Sarmatians and Alans, throughout the Andronovo horizon during the 1st millennium BC.

The Sintashta site on the upper Ural River, noted for its chariot burials and kurgans containing horse burials, is considered the type site of the Sintashta culture, forming one of the earliest parts of the &quot;Andronovo horizon&quot;. It is conjectured that the language spoken was still in the Proto-Indo-Iranian stage.

Comparisons between the archaeological evidence of the Andronovo and textual evidence of Indo-Iranians (i. e. the &quot;Vedas&quot; and the &quot;Avesta&quot;) are frequently made to support the Indo-Iranian identity of the Andronovo. The modern explanations for the Indo-Iranianization of Greater Iran and the Indian subcontinent rely heavily on the supposition that the Andronovo expanded southwards into Central Asia or at least achieved linguistic dominance across the Bronze Age urban centres of the region, such as the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex. While the earlier phases of the Andronovo culture are regarded as co-ordinate with the late period of Indo-Iranian linguistic unity, it is likely that in the later period they constituted a branch of the Iranians. According to Narasimhan et al. (2019), the expansion of the Andronovo culture towards the BMAC took place via the Inner Asia Mountain Corridor.

According to Hiebert, an expansion of the BMAC into Iran and the margin of the Indus Valley is &quot;the best candidate for an archaeological correlate of the introduction of Indo-Iranian speakers to Iran and South Asia&quot;, despite the absence of the characteristic timber graves of the steppe in the Near East, or south of the region between Kopet Dag and Pamir-Karakorum. Mallory acknowledges the difficulties of making a case for expansions from Andronovo to northern South Asia, and that attempts to link the Indo-Aryans to such sites as the Beshkent and Vakhsh cultures &quot;only gets the Indo-Iranian to Central Asia, but not as far as the seats of the Medes, Persians or Indo-Aryans&quot;. He has developed the &quot;Kulturkugel&quot; model that has the Indo-Iranians taking over Bactria-Margiana cultural traits but preserving their language and religion while moving into Iran and India.

Based on its use by Indo-Aryans in Mitanni and Vedic India, its prior absence in the Near East and Harappan India, and its 17th–16th century BC attestation at the Andronovo site of Sintashta, Kuzmina (1994) argues that the chariot corroborates the identification of Andronovo as Indo-Iranian. Klejn (1974) and Brentjes (1981) found the Andronovo culture much too late for an Indo-Iranian identification since chariot-using Aryans appear in Mitanni by the 15th century BC. However, dated a chariot burial at Krivoye Lake to around 2000 BC.

Eugene Helimski has suggested that the Andronovo people spoke a separate branch of Indo-Iranian. He claims that borrowings in the Finno-Ugric languages support this view. Vladimir Napolskikh has proposed that borrowings in Finno-Ugric indicate that the language was specifically of the Indo-Aryan type.

Since older forms of Indo-Iranian words have been taken over in Uralic and Proto-Yeniseian, occupation by some other languages (also lost ones) cannot be ruled out altogether, at least for part of the Andronovo area, i. e., Uralic and Yeniseian.

Rasmus G. Bjørn (2022) describes the linguistic heritage of the Andronovo cultural complex as &quot;Indo-Iranic dialect continuum&quot;, with a later split between Iranic and Indic. Early Iranic can be associated with later stages of the Andronovo horizon. Indo-Iranian derived loanwords via the Andronovo cultural complex can be found in both Proto-Uralic and later in Proto-Turkic, suggesting some forms of contact near the Altai Mountains (specifically the Minusinsk basin) and Mongolia respectively. Some loanwords related to horse pastoralism are also found in Old Chinese.

==Physical appearance==
In studies from the mid-2000s, the Andronovo have been described by archaeologists as having cranial features similar to ancient and modern European populations though these cranial features are not exclusive to Europeans. Andronovo skulls are similar to those of the Srubnaya culture and Sintashta culture, exhibiting features such as dolicocephaly. Through Iranian and Indo-Aryan migrations, this physical type expanded southwards and mixed with aboriginal peoples, contributing to the formation of modern populations of the northern Indian subcontinent.

==Archaeogenetics==

The Andronovo culture and its population derived primarily from an eastwards expansion of the Central European Corded Ware culture via the Fatyanovo–Balanovo and Sintashta culture, which are characterized by the combination of mainly Yamnaya-like ancestry and Early European Farmers admixture. The spread of Sintashta-Andronovo ancestry correlates with the expansion of Indo-Iranian-speaking peoples. Andronovo ancestry (c. 57%), in tandem with BMAC admixture (c. 43%), represents the later Iranian dispersal into the Iranian Plateau, while BMAC admixture is not found among the Indo-Aryan migrations into South Asia, suggesing two independent routes, one via the BMAC and one via the Inner Asian mountain corridor.

=== Studies ===
Fox et al. (2004) established that, during the Bronze and Iron Age period, the majority of the population of Kazakhstan (part of the Andronovo culture during Bronze Age) was of West Eurasian origin (with mtDNA haplogroups such as U, H, HV, T, I and W), and that prior to the thirteenth to seventh century BC, all Kazakh samples belonged to European lineages.

Keyser et al. (2009) published a study of the ancient Siberian cultures, the Andronovo culture, the Karasuk culture, the Tagar culture and the Tashtyk culture. Ten individuals of the Andronovo horizon in southern Siberia from 1800 BC to 1400 BC were surveyed. Extractions of mtDNA from nine individuals were determined to represent two samples of haplogroup U4 and single samples of Z1, T1, U2e, T4, H, K2b and U5a1. Extractions of Y-DNA from one individual was determined to belong to Y-DNA haplogroup C (but not C3), while the other two extractions were determined to belong to haplogroup R1a1a, which is thought to mark the eastward migration of the early Indo-Europeans. Of the individuals surveyed, only two (or 22%) were determined to be of Asian ancestry, while seven (or 78%) were determined to be of European ancestry, with the majority being light-skinned with predominantly light eyes and light hair.

In a June 2015 study published in Nature, one male and three female individuals of Andronovo culture were surveyed. Extraction of Y-DNA from the male was determined to belong to R1a1a1b. Extractions of mtDNA were determined to represent two samples of U4 and two samples of U2e. The people of the Andronovo culture were found to be closely genetically related to the preceding Sintashta culture, which was in turn closely genetically related to the Corded Ware culture, suggesting that the Sintashta culture represented an eastward expansion of Corded Ware peoples. The Corded Ware peoples were in turn found to be closely genetically related to the Beaker culture, the Unetice culture and particularly the peoples of the Nordic Bronze Age. Numerous cultural similarities between the Sintashta/Andronovo culture, the Nordic Bronze Age and the peoples of the Rigveda have been detected.

A genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2018 examined the remains of an Andronovo female buried . She was found to be a carrier of the maternal haplogroup U2e1h.

In a genetic study published in Science in September 2019, a large number of remains from the Andronovo horizon was examined. The vast majority of Y-DNA extracted belonged to R1a1a1b or various subclades of it (particularly R1a1a1b2a2a). The majority of mtDNA samples extracted belonged to U, although other haplogroups also occurred. The people of the Andronovo culture were found to be closely genetically related to the people of the Corded Ware culture, the Potapovka culture, the Sintashta culture and Srubnaya culture. These were found to harbor mixed ancestry from the Yamnaya culture and peoples of the Central European Middle Neolithic. People in the northwestern areas of Andronovo were found to be &quot;genetically largely homogeneous&quot; and &quot;genetically almost indistinguishable&quot; from Sintashta people. The genetic data suggested that the Andronovo culture and its Sintastha predecessor were ultimately derived of a remigration of Central European peoples with steppe ancestry back into the steppe. This is in particular defined by the majority (n=12) of R-Z93 SNPs.

Manjusha Chintalapati, Nick Patterson, and Priya Moorjani (in a peer-reviewed paper, July 18, 2022) estimate through DATES (Distribution of Ancestry Tracts of Evolutionary Signals) that genetic characteristics, typical of Andronovo culture&#x27;s people formed around 900 years before this archaeological culture appeared, 2900 BCE.

<text>Chromotropic acid is a chemical compound with the formula (HO)2C10H4(SO3H)2.

It can be used for as a reagent in the quantitative determination of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).

Chromotropic acid is also used for testing for the presence of formaldehyde. The usefulness of this reagent in quantitative determination is the formation of a red coloration (peaking at 580 nm wavelength) when chromotropic acid in 50% sulfuric acid reacts with formaldehyde. The coloration is specific to this aldehyde and is not produced from other organic species such as other aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids. The NIOSH Formaldehyde method #3500 is the reference analytical standard that uses chromotropic acid.

<text>The Somena (or S’amuna’) are one of several Hul̓q̓umín̓um̓-speaking indigenous peoples living in the Cowichan Valley-Duncan region of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.

The Somena were one of seven tribes or nations that were forced to amalgamate into one &quot;band&quot;, named the Cowichan Tribes after their general location, the Cowichan Valley and Cowichan Bay. The other peoples henceforth known as &quot;the Cowichans&quot; were the Quamichan/Kw’amutsun (the largest cultural group), Clemclemaluts (L’uml’umuluts), Comiaken (Qwum’yiqun’), Khenipsen (Hinupsum), Kilpahlas (Tl’ulpalus), and Koksilah (Hwulqwselu).

<text>Puisne judge and puisne justice () are terms for an ordinary judge or a judge of lesser rank of a particular court. The term comes from a combination of the two French words, (since, later) and (born) which have been combined as or ; meaning &quot;junior&quot;.

==Use==
The term is used almost exclusively in common law jurisdictions: the jurisdiction of England and Wales within the United Kingdom; Australia, including its states and territories; Canada, including its provinces and territories; India, including its states and territories; Pakistan, its provinces, and Azad Kashmir; the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar; Kenya; Sri Lanka; South Africa in rural provinces and Hong Kong. In Australia, the most senior judge after a chief justice in superior state courts is referred to as the &quot;senior puisne judge&quot;.

Use is rare outside of, usually internal, court (judicial) procedural decisions as to which will sit or has sat in hearings or appeals. The term is dated in detailed, academic case law analyses and, to varying degree direct applicability in higher courts.

The term excludes the court&#x27;s chief /; any seniormost judges, often specialists or a managerial head, sitting &quot;ex officio&quot; (by virtue of their office) as such in the court for which they have duties below; and any technically junior judges who may have been called to serve in a higher court, whom law reports and transcripts customarily specify as &quot;sitting in&quot; a judicial panel of a higher court or &quot;sitting as&quot; a judge of that court.

<doc id="1097815" wikidata="Q7376217" url="?curid=1097815" title="Rubus occidentalis">
<text>Rubus occidentalis is a species of &quot;Rubus&quot; native to eastern North America. Its common name black raspberry is shared with other closely related species. Other names occasionally used include bear&#x27;s eye blackberry, black cap, black cap raspberry, and scotch cap.

==Description==

&quot;Rubus occidentalis&quot; is a deciduous shrub growing to tall. The leaves are pinnate, with five leaflets on leaves, strong-growing stems in their first year, and three leaflets on leaves on flowering branchlets. The flowers are distinct in having long, slender sepals long, more than twice as long as the petals. The round-shaped fruit is a diameter aggregation of drupelets; it is edible, and has a high content of anthocyanins and ellagic acid.

Long stems also called canes grow up to in length, usually forming an arch shape, but sometimes upright. Canes have curved, sharp thorns, while immature canes are unbranched and have a whitish bloom.

The black raspberry is related to the red raspberry &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; and &quot;Rubus strigosus&quot;, sharing the white underside of leaves, and fruit that readily detaches from the carpel.

It is closely related to Rubus leucodermis, which is also named black raspberry and blackcap. 

== Habitat ==

The plant grows in disturbed areas, especially those that are logged or cut. It is also found in meadows, and near streams and lakes, trails or roadways. The native range of &quot;Rubus occidentalis&quot; extends as far east as New Brunswick, as far west as Nebraska, as far north as Quebec, and as far south as Mississippi.

== Pests and diseases ==
Apple mosaic virus, black raspberry necrosis virus, &quot;Elsinoë veneta&quot;, raspberry bushy dwarf virus, raspberry leaf curl virus, &quot;Rhizobium radiobacter&quot;, &quot;Rhizobium rhizogenes&quot;, &quot;Didymella applanata&quot;, &quot;Monilinia fructigena&quot;, &quot;Peronospora sparsa&quot;, and &quot;Peridroma saucia&quot; all infest black raspberries.

== Cultivars ==
Common black raspberry cultivars include: Black Hawk, Bristol, Jewel, Cumberland, Morrison, Munger, and Logan.

== Commercial growing and processing ==
The center for black raspberry production is in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The main cultivar, &#x27;Munger&#x27;, is grown on about . Other cultivars include &#x27;John Robertson&#x27;, &#x27;Allen&#x27;, &#x27;Jewel&#x27;, &#x27;Blackhawk&#x27;, &#x27;Macblack&#x27;, &#x27;Plum Farmer&#x27;, &#x27;Dundee&#x27;, &#x27;Hanover&#x27;, and &#x27;Huron&#x27;. The plants are summer tipped by hand, mechanically pruned in winter and then machine harvested. The yields are generally low per acre and this is why the fruits are often expensive.

The species has been used in the breeding of many &quot;Rubus&quot; hybrids; those between red and black raspberries are common under the name purple raspberries; &#x27;Brandywine&#x27;, &#x27;Royalty&#x27;, and &#x27;Estate&#x27; are examples of purple raspberry cultivars. Wild purple raspberries have also been found in various places in northeastern North America where the two parental species co-occur and occasionally hybridize naturally.

The berries are typically dried or frozen, made into purées and juices, or processed as colorants. Fresh berries are also marketed in season. Two well-known liqueurs based predominantly on black raspberry fruit include France&#x27;s Chambord Liqueur Royale de France and South Korea&#x27;s various kinds of Bokbunja-ju.

<doc id="1097818" wikidata="Q883145" url="?curid=1097818" title="Blue-tongued skink">
<text>Blue-tongued skinks comprise the Australasian genus Tiliqua, which contains some of the largest members of the skink family (Scincidae). They are commonly called blue-tongued lizards or simply blue-tongues or blueys in Australia or panana in Indonesia. As suggested by these common names, a prominent characteristic of the genus is a large blue tongue that can be bared as bluff-warning to potential enemies. Their tongue can also deform itself and produce a thick mucus in order to catch prey. They are relatively shy in comparison with other lizards, and also significantly slower due to their shorter legs.

==Systematics and distribution==
Blue-tongued skinks are closely related to the genera &quot;Cyclodomorphus&quot; and &quot;Hemisphaeriodon&quot;. All species are found on mainland Australia with the exception of &quot;Tiliqua gigas&quot;, which occurs in New Guinea and various islands of Indonesia. The Tanimbar blue-tongued skink, a subspecies of &quot;Tiliqua scincoides&quot;, is also found on several small Indonesian islands between Australia and New Guinea. &quot;Tiliqua nigrolutea&quot;, the blotched blue-tongued skink, is the only species present in Tasmania.

==Ecology==
Most species are diurnal, ground-foraging omnivores, feeding on a wide variety of insects, gastropods, flowers, fruits, and berries. The pygmy blue-tongue is again the exception, being primarily an ambush predator of terrestrial arthropods. 

All are ovoviviparous, with litter sizes ranging from 1-4 in the pygmy blue-tongue and shingleback to 5-24 in the eastern and northern blue-tongues.

==Species==
===Extinct species===
Multiple extinct species have been proposed. &quot;T. frangens&quot;, the largest known species of the genus, lived during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epoch around the Wellington Caves of New South Wales in Australia. Another extinct species &quot;T. laticephala&quot; may represent the same taxon as &quot;T. frangens&quot;. Its nearest relative is the extant &quot;T. rugosa&quot;, which is half the size and lacks the bony plates of &quot;T. frangens&quot;.

Another extinct species &quot;T. wilkinsonorum&quot; also lived during the Pliocene epoch. The earliest possible species is &quot;T. pusilla&quot; from the middle Miocene, but researchers question whether this species belong to the genus &quot;Tiliqua&quot; due to its uncertain phylogenetic position that causes paraphyly.

==In captivity==
Some species of this genus are kept as household pets. They are on average very friendly when raised in captivity, and are often called &#x27;the dogs of reptiles&#x27;. Captive specimens can live 20 years or longer.

<text>Louise Juliette Talma (October 31, 1906August 13, 1996) was an American composer, academic, and pianist. After studies in New York and in France, piano with Isidor Philipp and composition with Nadia Boulanger, she focused on composition from 1935. She taught at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, and at Hunter College. Her opera &quot;The Alcestiad&quot; was the first full-scale opera by an American woman staged in Europe. She was the first woman in the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the first woman awarded the Sibelius Medal for Composition.

== Career ==
Born in Arcachon in France to an American mother, Alma Cecile Garrigues, a professional soprano who took the name Cecile Talma around 1900, and a father whose identity remains unknown. Mother and daughter returned to the United States in 1914, settling in New York City. Talma grew up surrounded by music but was also an excellent science student and considered becoming a chemist before deciding on a career as a musician. After graduating from Wadleigh High School, Talma studied chemistry at Columbia University while simultaneously studying piano and composition at the Institute of Musical Arts (now Juilliard) in New York from 1922 to 1930. She received her Bachelor of Music degree from New York University in 1931 and her Master of Arts degree from Columbia in 1933. She studied piano with Isidor Philipp at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France, every summer from 1926 to 1935. From 1928, she studied annually composition with Nadia Boulanger, deciding in 1935 to focus on composition. She continued the studies with Boulanger until 1939. Talma taught at Hunter College of the City University of New York from the late 1920s.

In 1926, after making a successful debut as a concert pianist in New York, Talma spent her first summer at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France, where she met pedagogue Nadia Boulanger. Under Boulanger&#x27;s guidance, Talma gave up her piano studies in order to focus on composition, converted from agnosticism to Roman Catholicism in 1934 with Boulanger as her godmother, and adopted a lifestyle similar to Boulanger&#x27;s in its devotion to music. While many of her early works express desire for an unattainable beloved (likely Boulanger), she also composed more than 20 religious works after her conversion, setting a number of sacred texts and spiritual writings. Talma&#x27;s copious correspondence reveals several passionate affairs with women, including one in late life with Ethelston (Eth) Chapman, who had been a fellow student in Fontainebleau with Talma. She never married. 

Talma&#x27;s first pieces show an interest in neo-classical approaches and techniques and appear to be highly autobiographical, establishing compositional patterns that would continue throughout her career. Speaking of her creative life, Talma identified three periods: her early works, which were composed during her “neo-classical period,” 1925–1951; her “serial period,” 1952–1967; and her “non-serial atonal period,” 1967–1996. However, after adopting serial methods in 1952, the majority of her works even in this last period owe something to serial approaches, especially in terms of melody creation.

Talma&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 1 (1943), &quot;Toccata for Orchestra&quot; (1944) and &quot;Alleluia in the Form of Toccata&quot; for piano (1945) were highly praised by critics and helped establish Talma as an important American composer at the beginning of her career. Based in part on the success of these works, she was the second woman (after Ruth Crawford Seeger in 1930) to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship in music composition and the first woman awarded back-to-back Guggenheims in 1946 and 1947. In the 1940s Talma also began spending each summer at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, where most of her mature works were composed. Talma was a full-time member of the music faculty at Hunter College in New York from 1928 until 1979, during which time she helped author two harmony textbooks for her students.

In 1952, Talma heard Irving Fine&#x27;s serial but tonally-centered string quartet and immediately began working with serial approaches and techniques in her works. Although she stated that her serial period primarily extended from 1952 to 1967, the majority of her works up until her death engaged with some form of serial practice. Her setting of e. e. cummings&#x27;s “Let’s Touch the Sky” was her first completed serial work; her String Quartet (1954), Piano Sonata No. 2 (1955), and &quot;La Corona&quot; (1955), a setting of John Donne&#x27;s Holy Sonnets all use clearly audible serial elements. As she developed her own compositional voice using serial elements, Talma created rows that allowed for tonal centering as well as more traditional, stricter use of pitch class sets.

Talma began working on a grand opera with writer Thornton Wilder in 1954 after the two had met while working at the MacDowell Colony. They considered several scenarios before deciding to base the opera on Wilder&#x27;s existing stage play about the Greek figure Alcestis. Composed while Talma was in residence at the American Academy in Rome and at the MacDowell Colony, &quot;The Alcestiad&quot; was completed in 1958. Although several American opera houses, including the Lyric Opera in Chicago, the Met, and the San Francisco Opera, expressed interest in the work, all of them deemed it too difficult for American performers and audiences. Wilder had previously enjoyed considerable success in Germany, and &quot;Die Alkestiade&quot; was premiered by the Oper Frankfurt in 1962. It was the first time full-scale opera by an American woman was performed at a major European theatre. However, perhaps due to the enormous resources the work requires, and despite the fact that it was critically and publicly well-received, it remains relatively unknown. Nonetheless, &quot;The Alcestiad&quot; secured Talma a place in the ranks of ground-breaking American and female composers; in 1963 she was the first female composer to win the Harriet Cohen International Music Award; and in 1974 was the first woman elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

Talma&#x27;s extensive body of works include vocal and choral pieces and works for solo piano, chamber ensembles, and orchestra, as well as a chamber opera, and settings of texts by Auden, Browning, Dickinson, Donne, Hopkins, Keats, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Stevens, Wyatt, and others. Talma dedicated several works to John F. Kennedy after his assassination, including &quot;Dialogues&quot; for piano and orchestra (1964) and &quot;A Time to Remember&quot; (1967), an oratorio that sets Kennedy&#x27;s own words. &quot;The Tolling Bell&quot;, Talma&#x27;s setting of texts by Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Donne for baritone and orchestra, was completed in 1969 and nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in music. Talma wrote her own libretto for her 1976 chamber opera, &quot;Have You Heard? Do You Know?&quot;, a work about the Cold War and the desire for utopias; and continued to compose prolifically into her eighties. She died in Saratoga Springs, New York while working on an elegiac piece, &quot;The Lengthening Shadows&quot;, while in residence at the Yaddo colony. The bulk of her papers are held at the Library of Congress. 

A full-length study of Talma&#x27;s music by musicologist Kendra Preston Leonard, &quot;Louise Talma: A Life in Composition&quot;, was published in 2014.

<text>Arthur David Davis (December 5, 1934 – July 29, 2007) was a double-bassist, known for his work with Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, McCoy Tyner and Max Roach.

==Biography==
Davis was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States, where he began studying the piano at the age of five, switched to tuba, and finally to bass while attending high school. He studied at Juilliard and Manhattan School of Music but graduated from Hunter College.

As a New York session musician, he recorded with many jazz and pop musicians and also in symphony orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic and Los Angeles Philharmonic. He recorded with Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, and John Coltrane among other jazz musicians. Art Davis was a professor at Orange Coast College.

Davis is also known for starting a legal case that led to blind auditions for orchestras.

Davis earned a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from New York University in 1982. He moved in 1986 to southern California, where he balanced his teaching and practicing of psychology with jazz performances.

Davis died on July 29, 2007, following a heart attack. He was survived by two sons and a daughter.

<text>The GIAT 30 is a series of 30 mm cannon developed to replace the DEFA 550 series weapons on French military aircraft.

Introduced in the late 1980s, the GIAT 30 is a revolver cannon with electric ignition and automatic recocking. Unlike the DEFA cannon, the revolver chamber is electrically operated, rather than gas operated, improving both reliability and rate of fire.

Two versions of the GIAT 30 are offered.

==GIAT 30M 781==

Primarily intended for helicopter use and offered in several fixed, podded, and turreted installations. It is long with a total system weight of . It is designed to fire the ADEN/DEFA 30×113mm B rounds. The weight of the projectile varies from for HEI to for APHEI-SD. Typical muzzle velocity is with a rate of fire of 750 rounds per minute.

Given its considerable recoil, it is typically used for single shots or controlled bursts rather than continuous fire. The 30 M781 is used on the Eurocopter Tiger and is also offered for naval use as part of the NARWHAL (NAval Remote Weapon High Accuracy and Light) system.

Ammunition: HEI; SAPHEI; APHEI-SD; API-T; TP.

==GIAT 30M 791==

Intended for fighter aircraft such as the Dassault Rafale. It uses a new range of 30×150mm B ammunition in a variety of types. It has a muzzle velocity of , which amounts to a muzzle energy of more than from the mass of the projectile alone (not taking into account explosive chemical energy). A variable rate of fire allows cyclic rates of 300, 600, 1500, or 2500 rounds per minute. It can fire continuous bursts or controlled 0.5 or 1 second bursts.

<doc id="1097846" wikidata="Q6708554" url="?curid=1097846" title="Lynda Lee-Potter">
<text>Lynda Lee-Potter (; 2 May 1935 – 20 October 2004) was a British journalist. She was best known as a columnist for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

==Early years==
Lynda Higginson was born into a working-class family in the mining town of Leigh, Lancashire. Her father, Norman, was a miner who would later turn to painting and decorating, while her mother, Margaret () worked in a shoe shop; Lynda won a place at Leigh Girls&#x27; Grammar School, which she described as &quot;the escape route for ordinary children and the pathway to a new life&quot;. Her first ambition was to become an actress and, aged 18, she went to London to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, later telling friends that she lost her Lancashire accent on the train down. After leaving the Guildhall School, and using the stage name &quot;Lynda Berrison&quot;, she won a part in one of Brian Rix&#x27;s farces at the Whitehall Theatre.

Higginson&#x27;s life changed when she met Jeremy Lee-Potter, the son of Air Marshal Sir Patrick Lee-Potter, who was then a medical student at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. They married in December 1957, after which he was posted to Aden, as an RAF doctor. While living there, she began her career as a journalist, writing articles for the &quot;Aden Chronicle&quot; about life as an expatriate. Her husband became an eminent consultant haematologist, based at Poole Hospital, chairman of the Council of the British Medical Association from 1990 to 1993 and the deputy chairman of the professional conduct committee of the General Medical Council.

==&quot;Daily Mail&quot;==
She joined the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as a feature writer in 1967, but her big break came five years later, when Jean Rook left the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. Lee-Potter recalled: &quot;I remember I had the day off, and our features editor phoned up and said: &#x27;the editor (David English) wants you to come in and do a column,&#x27; and I said &#x27;Oh, right&#x27;. I went in and did it. Every week I thought somebody else would probably take over. But it&#x27;s just carried on.&quot;

One journalist who was given the job of interviewing her reported:It is difficult when approaching Lee-Potter to know if you will be getting the columnist or the affable interviewer. Questions about her views are deftly parried, and turned into questions about yours. Within 10 minutes of our meeting, she had determined my marital status, number of children, place of residence, so on and so forth.

== &quot;Class Act&quot; == 
In 2000, she wrote a book called &quot;Class Act: How to Beat the British Class System&quot;. In the book, she declared that &quot;people may well sneer at me for writing a book about class&quot;, she declared. &quot;Others will say that nobody called Lynda from a working-class background has any right to pontificate on the subject. Actually, I can&#x27;t think of anybody better equipped, having probably trawled my way through more classes than most&quot;.

The book offered aperçus such as &quot;upper middle-class mummies have little trouble with au pairs because they are naturally authoritative&quot; and &quot;the lower middle-classes desperately want to be dainty&quot;, and dispensed advice, such as what to take your hostess at country house weekends: &quot;Under no circumstances take a poinsettia, which is the plant equivalent of a bottle of Blue Nun.&quot;

She made no apology for her interest in the subject: &quot;The only people who hanker after a classless society are those who want what other people have without working for it&quot;. Snobbery, she said, &quot;will always be with us&quot;, adding: &quot;It has certainly motivated me all my life. I may be ridiculous, but I don&#x27;t care.&quot;

==Awards==
Lee-Potter was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1998 New Year Honours for services to
journalism and for charitable services. She was named Columnist of the Year in 1984 and 2001, Feature Writer of the Year in 1987 and 1993, and Woman Writer of the Year in 1989.

==Illness and death==
On 20 October 2004, Lee-Potter died after a brain tumour. She was survived by her husband and three children, all of whom followed their mother into journalism.

<text>Lukas Foss (August 15, 1922 – February 1, 2009) was a German-American composer, pianist, and conductor.

== Career ==
Born Lukas Fuchs in Berlin, Germany in 1922, Foss was soon recognized as a child prodigy. He began piano and theory lessons with Julius Goldstein [Herford] in Berlin at the age of six. His parents were Hilde (Schindler) and the philosopher and scholar Martin Foss. In 1933, when Adolf Hitler came into power, the Jewish family moved from Germany to Paris, where Lukas studied piano with Lazare Lévy, composition with Noël Gallon, orchestration with Felix Wolfes, and flute with Marcel Moyse. In 1937 he moved with his parents and brother to the United States, where his father (on advice from the Quakers who had taken the family in upon arrival in Philadelphia) changed the family name to Foss. He studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, with Isabelle Vengerova (piano), Rosario Scalero (composition) and Fritz Reiner (conducting).

At Curtis, Foss began a lifelong friendship with classmate Leonard Bernstein, who later described Foss as an &quot;authentic genius.&quot; In 1961 Bernstein conducted the premiere of Foss&#x27;s &quot;Time Cycle&quot;, while Foss would conduct the premiere of Bernstein&#x27;s Symphonic Dances from &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

Foss also studied with Serge Koussevitzky during the summers from 1939 to 1943 at the Berkshire Music Center (now known as the Tanglewood Music Center) and, as a special student, composition with Paul Hindemith at Yale University from 1939 to 1940. He became an American citizen in 1942.

Foss was appointed professor of music at UCLA in 1953, replacing Arnold Schoenberg. While there he founded the Improvisation Chamber Ensemble, which made its Boston debut in 1962 for the Peabody Mason Concert series. He founded the Center of the Creative and Performing Arts in 1963 while at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

Over six separate years from 1961 to 1987, Foss was the music director of the Ojai Music Festival. From 1963 to 1970 he was music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. From 1971 to 1988 he was music director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic (formerly Brooklyn Philharmonia), while also music director of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra from 1972 to 1976. From 1981 to 1986, he was conductor of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. He was a professor of music, theory, and composition at Boston University beginning in 1991. In 1994, he conducted a concert in the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series. His notable students include Faye-Ellen Silverman, Claire Polin and Rocco Di Pietro.

Foss is grouped in the &quot;Boston school&quot; along with Arthur Berger, Irving Fine, Alexei Haieff, Harold Shapero, and Claudio Spies. He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity. In 2000 he was awarded a Gold Medal by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

== Compositions ==
== Notable students ==
== Personal life ==
In 1951 Foss married Cornelia Brendel, an artist and painter who was born in Berlin in 1931, the daughter of art historian Otto Brendel and Maria Weigert Brendel. The couple had two children, Christopher Brendel Foss, who became a documentary filmmaker and corporate consultant on social and environmental engagement/sustainability communications, and Eliza Foss Topol, an actress. Foss and his wife were separated for almost five years from 1968 to 1972, during which Cornelia was the lover of pianist Glenn Gould and moved with the two children to Toronto, an arrangement that she later called, &quot;a perfect triangle&quot;.

Foss, who had Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his final years, died at his home in Manhattan on February 1, 2009, aged 86, of a heart attack.

<doc id="1097849" wikidata="Q1705752" url="?curid=1097849" title="Relativistic beaming">
<text>In physics, relativistic beaming (also known as Doppler beaming, Doppler boosting, or the headlight effect) is the process by which relativistic effects modify the apparent luminosity of emitting matter that is moving at speeds close to the speed of light. In an astronomical context, relativistic beaming commonly occurs in two oppositely-directed relativistic jets of plasma that originate from a central compact object that is accreting matter. Accreting compact objects and relativistic jets are invoked to explain x-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, and, on a much larger scale, (AGN) active galactic nuclei (of which quasars are a particular variety).

Beaming affects the apparent brightness of a moving object. Consider a cloud of gas moving relative to the observer and emitting electromagnetic radiation. If the gas is moving towards the observer, it will be brighter than if it were at rest, but if the gas is moving away, it will appear fainter. The magnitude of the effect is illustrated by the AGN jets of the galaxies M87 and 3C 31 (see images at right). M87 has twin jets aimed almost directly towards and away from Earth; the jet moving towards Earth is clearly visible (the long, thin blueish feature in the top image at right), while the other jet is so much fainter it is not visible. In 3C 31, both jets (labeled in the lower figure at right) are at roughly right angles to our line of sight, and thus, both are visible. The upper jet points slightly more in Earth&#x27;s direction and is therefore brighter.

Relativistically, moving objects are beamed due to a variety of physical effects. Light aberration causes most of the photons to be emitted along the object&#x27;s direction of motion. The Doppler effect changes the energy of the photons by red- or blue shifting them. Finally, time intervals as measured by clocks moving alongside the emitting object are different from those measured by an observer on Earth due to time dilation and photon arrival time effects. How all of these effects modify the brightness, or apparent luminosity, of a moving object is determined by the equation describing the relativistic Doppler effect (which is why relativistic beaming is also known as Doppler beaming).

== A simple jet model ==
The simplest model for a jet is one where a single, homogeneous sphere is travelling towards the Earth at nearly the speed of light. This simple model is also an unrealistic one, but it illustrates the physical process of beaming.

=== Synchrotron spectrum and the spectral index ===
Relativistic jets emit most of their energy via synchrotron emission. In our simple model, the sphere contains highly relativistic electrons and a steady magnetic field. Electrons inside the blob travel at speeds a tiny fraction below the speed of light and are whipped around by the magnetic field. Each change in direction by an electron is accompanied by the release of energy in the form of a photon. With enough electrons and a powerful enough magnetic field, the relativistic sphere can emit a huge number of photons, ranging from those at relatively weak radio frequencies to powerful X-ray photons.

Features of a simple synchrotron spectrum include, at low frequencies, the jet sphere is opaque and its luminosity increases with frequency until it peaks and begins to decline. This &quot;peak frequency&quot; occurs at formula_1. At frequencies higher than this, the jet sphere is transparent. The luminosity decreases with frequency until a &quot;break frequency&quot; is reached, after which it declines more rapidly. The break frequency occurs when formula_2. The sharp break frequency occurs because at very high frequencies, the electrons which emit the photons lose most of their energy rapidly. A sharp decrease in the number of high energy electrons means a sharp decrease in the spectrum.

The changes in slope in the synchrotron spectrum are parameterized with a &quot;spectral index&quot;. The spectral index, α, over a given frequency range is simply the slope on a diagram of formula_3 vs. formula_4. (Of course for α to have real meaning the spectrum must be very nearly a straight line across the range in question.)

=== Beaming equation ===
In the simple jet model of a single homogeneous sphere the observed luminosity is related to the intrinsic luminosity as

:formula_5

where
:formula_6

The observed luminosity therefore depends on the speed of the jet and the angle to the line of sight through the Doppler factor, formula_7, and also on the properties inside the jet, as shown by the exponent with the spectral index.

The beaming equation can be broken down into a series of three effects:
* Relativistic aberration
* Time dilation
* Blue- or redshifting

==== Aberration ====
Aberration is the change in an object&#x27;s apparent direction caused by the relative transverse motion of the observer. In inertial systems it is equal and opposite to the light time correction.

In everyday life aberration is a well-known phenomenon. Consider a person standing in the rain on a day when there is no wind. If the person is standing still, then the rain drops will follow a path that is straight down to the ground. However, if the person is moving, for example in a car, the rain will appear to be approaching at an angle. This apparent change in the direction of the incoming raindrops is aberration.

The amount of aberration depends on the speed of the emitted object or wave relative to the observer. In the example above this would be the speed of a car compared to the speed of the falling rain. This does not change when the object is moving at a speed close to formula_8. Like the classic and relativistic effects, aberration depends on: 1) the speed of the emitter at the time of emission, and 2) the speed of the observer at the time of absorption.

In the case of a relativistic jet, beaming (emission aberration) will make it appear as if more energy is sent forward, along the direction the jet is traveling. In the simple jet model a homogeneous sphere will emit energy equally in all directions in the rest frame of the sphere. In the rest frame of Earth the moving sphere will be observed to be emitting most of its energy along its direction of motion. The energy, therefore, is ‘beamed’ along that direction.

Quantitatively, aberration accounts for a change in luminosity of

: formula_9

==== Time dilation ====
Time dilation is a well-known consequence of special relativity and accounts for a change in observed luminosity of
:formula_10

==== Blue- or redshifting ====
Blue- or redshifting can change the observed luminosity at a particular frequency, but this is not a beaming effect.

Blueshifting accounts for a change in observed luminosity of

:formula_11

==== Lorentz invariants ====
A more-sophisticated method of deriving the beaming equations starts with the quantity formula_12. This quantity is a Lorentz invariant, so the value is the same in different reference frames.

== Terminology ==
; beamed, beaming : shorter terms for ‘relativistic beaming’
; beta : the ratio of the jet speed to the speed of light, sometimes called ‘relativistic beta’
; core : region of a galaxy around the central black hole
; counter-jet : the jet on the far side of a source oriented close to the line of sight, can be very faint and difficult to observe
; Doppler factor : a mathematical expression which measures the strength (or weakness) of relativistic effects in AGN, including beaming, based on the jet speed and its angle to the line of sight with Earth
; flat spectrum : a term for a non-thermal spectrum that emits a great deal of energy at the higher frequencies when compared to the lower frequencies
; intrinsic luminosity : the luminosity from the jet in the rest frame of the jet
; jet (often termed &#x27;relativistic jet&#x27;): a high velocity (close to c) stream of plasma emanating from the polar direction of an AGN
; observed luminosity : the luminosity from the jet in the rest frame of Earth
; spectral index :a measure of how a non-thermal spectrum changes with frequency. The smaller α is, the more significant the energy at higher frequencies is. Typically α is in the range of 0 to 2.
; steep spectrum : a term for a non-thermal spectrum that emits little energy at the higher frequencies when compared to the lower frequencies

=== Physical quantities ===

; angle to the line-of-sight with Earth : formula_13
; jet speed : formula_14
; intrinsic luminosity : formula_15 (sometimes called emitted luminosity)
; observed Luminosity : formula_16
; spectral index : formula_17 where formula_18
; Speed of light : formula_19 m/s

<doc id="1097855" wikidata="Q1092673" url="?curid=1097855" title="Ciompi Revolt">
<text>The Ciompi Revolt (, ; ) was a rebellion among unrepresented labourers which occurred in the Republic of Florence in Tuscany, Italy, from 1378 to 1382. Those who revolted consisted of artisans, labourers, and craftsmen who did not belong to any guilds and were therefore unable to participate in the Florentine government. These labourers had grown increasingly resentful over the established patrician oligarchy. In addition, they were expected to pay heavy taxes which they could not afford, forcing some to abandon their homes. The resulting insurrection over such tensions led to the creation of a government composed of wool workers and other disenfranchised workers which lasted for three and a half years.

The Ciompi Revolt developed in three stages: reform in May and June, the violent &quot;revolution&quot; of the revolt and fighting in mid-July, and the fall of the Ciompi government – the &quot;reaction&quot;, at the end of August 1378. These workers&#x27; underrepresentation led to their exploitation, low wages, and political impotence. In June 1378 the city&#x27;s fourteen minor guilds demanded greater representation in civic office from elites – the Signoria. These guildsmen still wanted to keep the Sotto posti, who were low wage textile workers with no guild representation, from forming their own guilds and being able to gain increased political power. To prevent this, the Signoria quadrupled the fee for admittance to the system. This action sparked indignation and turned the Sotto posti into opponents of the Signoria, aligning them with the lower class Ciompi. On 22 June the Ciompi took up arms for the first time but it was not until 21 July that they violently took over the city&#x27;s government and forced the Signoria to create three new guilds and grant them political office.

Historians commonly highlight a few individuals as central to the events. Representing the middle and upper class was Salvestro de&#x27; Medici. Representing the lower class was the mysterious group known as &quot;The Eight (Saints)&quot;. Finally caught in the middle of these two groups is Michele di Lando. He was &quot;separated from his social superior due to inferior birth, but he was also separated from his peers by his superior vision&quot;.

Although the Ciompi Revolt was brief, it left an impact on future generations. The three-and-a-half-year revolt not only affected Florentine society throughout the 15th century, but was a flashpoint in Florentine history, which continued to intrigue historians. Interpretations of the events evolved across the centuries.

==Background==

===Unstable government===
In the years preceding the 1378 revolt, certain aspects of Florentine society set the stage for the uprising. Tensions within the oligarchy were already present decades before the revolt occurred. The Arti Minori, or minor guilds, were constantly in contention with the Arti Maggiori, or the seven major guilds. Between the years of 1339 to 1349, wealthy houses went bankrupt and markets were reduced. The economy never peaked nor declined sharply again, aside from minor political and military disputes familiar to Florence. Economic grievances had drawn artisans and wage-labourers into Florentine politics from the mid-fourteenth century. These workers, however, were forbidden from associating by city government. The oligarchy was unstable, as many either died from the plague or fled to safer territories. From these turbulent times emerged the &quot;gente nuova&quot; (&#x27;new men&#x27;) a class of mainly immigrants with no aristocratic background who grew their wealth from trade. Together, the &quot;gente nuova&quot; and Arti Minori bonded over their dislike of the oligarchy. Each side sought to gain control over the other, as the oligarchy used the Guelph Party to justify their patriciate status, while the &quot;gente nuova&quot; appealed to the middle and lower classes for support. In 1375 the &quot;gente nuova&quot; seriously challenged the privileges of the oligarchy, sparking concerns from the latter of their possible collapse. In addition, war broke out against the papacy in the same year, increasing the costly burdens on the city. In late 1377 to early 1378, the oligarchy and the &quot;gente nuova&quot; formed a truce, only to be broken by the oligarchy in June, the month of the revolt.

===Upper class versus lower class and the origins of the term &quot;ciompi&quot;===
Tensions between the upper and lower classes were a major factor in bringing about the revolt. It is unclear who exactly qualified as belonging to the Florentine upper class, unlike in Venice, where the class hierarchy was solidly entrenched. For the most part of the 14th century, a patriciate could be identified by the presence of a family name. On the other side of the spectrum were the &quot;popolo minuto&quot;, or the labouring classes of Florence, which also had no set boundaries. For example, an artisan could be considered elite if he was wealthy and successful. The majority of the &quot;popolo minuto&quot;, however, consisted of poor labourers flocking from villages to the city for work. Forced loans, high taxes and an even higher incidence of indebtedness kept the &quot;ciompi&quot; impoverished. In 1355, the &quot;miserabiles&quot;, defined as having no property, whose possessions were worth less than 100 lire and had no trade or profession, accounted for 22% of households in Florence. The most important aspect of this class is that they had no representation in the Florentine government, which would be one of the main changes implemented by the &quot;ciompi&quot; later on. These artisans and labourers were not part of guilds until the &quot;ciompi&quot; and the Arti Minori took over the government beginning in 1378. In becoming the &quot;ciompi&quot;, the word derives from the florentine word for ‘cardare la lana’ or ‘ciompare’ as the wool workers were the most representative and numerous group of people involved in the revolt although it included also other groups. Records of condemned &quot;ciompi&quot; rebels show, in fact, that tavern owners were also found to be part of the revolt.

===Rising taxes===
In Florence in 1371, unequal taxation was the norm; in particular, the highlanders paid three times more in taxes than plain dwellers. This increase in taxation was not due to Florence&#x27;s wars with Pisa from 1362–1364, or to the revolt of San Miniato from 1369–1370, but from the need to pay for increased military forces to push back against the Ubaldini and their allies. The Ubaldini were a feudal family who had strong influences over the peasants living in the Alpi Fiorentine, and Florence wished to break these ties for control in the north. Adding to the need for more military forces was the increased crime and attacks directed at merchants and at pilgrims passing through Florence that developed after the Black Death. To pay these militias, however, Florence was getting deeper in debt, and the oligarchy burdened those living in the countryside with increasing taxation. As taxes kept on increasing, the highlanders chose to flee, worsening a labour shortage, already present after the Black Death. Furthermore, there were increasing differences in wealth between the &quot;popolo minuto&quot; and the patriciates. In fact, before the &quot;ciompi&quot;, there were already rebellions organized by labourers, such as the 9 October 1343 revolt by wool workers led by the Sienese Aldobrando di Ciecharino, who lived in Florence.

==Revolt==

The Revolt of the Ciompi was a popular revolt in Florence in 1378 spearheaded by wool carders known as &quot;Ciompi&quot; () and other non-guilded workers who rose up to demand a voice in the commune&#x27;s ordering in addition to enacting debt and tax reforms.
The revolt was an outburst of proletarian unrest in the city of Florence that began in June 1378 and consisted of three phases ending in August of the same year. It was the result of a power struggle between Florence&#x27;s ruling elites, the established artisan guilds of Florence, and Sotto posti (or un-guilded) which included the Ciompi; mainly a group of low-wage textile workers employed in Florence&#x27;s thriving wool industry. At its height, this trade sold fabrics throughout Italy as well as overseas and employed up to a third of Florence&#x27;s population. Many of the issues leading to the revolt of the Ciompi involved the politics and relations between guild and non-guild members, as well as the ruling elites of the city (the Signoria). Guild members and the guild system were important aspects of Florence&#x27;s politics by 1378, where they acted as political intermediaries between the individuals in their guild and the state. Guilds enforced industrial, fiscal, and monetary policy which benefited their trades and the lives of their workers in addition to representing them politically, regulating their industries, and controlling who could become a member. As mentioned previously the guild system involved a hierarchy between the seven major and fourteen minor guild associations; the former represented those who had become a class of prosperous cloth merchants and bankers/financiers, and the latter consisting of various artisans, craftsmen and skilled labourers including, but not limited to, shoemakers, tailors and wine merchants.

The 21 guilds, however, did not include the whole of Florence&#x27;s working population and many people were excluded from the system, thus limiting their protection from exploitation and ability to be involved in city politics. Few of those in the textile industry, including the Ciompi wool workers, were eligible for guild membership, with around only 200 of the approximately 14,000 people in wool manufacture qualifying, and the remainder named the Sotto posti who were designated ineligible for entry to the guild system or for creating a guild for their own benefit. The exclusion of the Ciompi from this system reinforced unequal power relations within the city, reducing the rights and protections available for these workers unlike those assigned to members in other guilds. It was a highly unequal society allowing Florence&#x27;s wool trade to thrive and set the stage for the revolt.

The Ciompi resented the controlling power that was centred in the Arte della Lana—the textile-manufacturing establishment which guided the economic engine of Florence&#x27;s prosperity—and was supported by the other major guilds as well as the limitations they faced in influencing politics, and the lower wages and exploitation they experienced as a result of their exclusion from the guild system. The consequent revolt of 1378 marked the high point of labour agitation in Florence.

===Three phases===
The Ciompi revolt occurred in three phases. These consisted a stage of reform in the months of May and June, the &quot;revolution&quot;, or violent outburst of the revolt occurring in mid-July, and the fall of the temporary Ciompi government – the &quot;reaction&quot;, which occurred at the end of August. In June 1378, the series of events began with the fourteen minor guilds of Florence demanding greater representation in civic office. Initially the Ciompi were not violently involved and the early stages of the revolt were as much a power struggle between the guilds as it was between Florence&#x27;s Signoria and the exploited lower class. The guildsmen who demanded this greater representation in government still sought to keep the Sotto posti from forming guilds and thereby being able to gain a political position. However, the Sotto posti soon submitted their own demands and hoped to have them met. The Signoria had no intention of granting the un-guilded Sotto posti these liberties however and instead, feeling threatened, made it more difficult to obtain office and quadrupled the fee for admittance. This action sparked indignation and turned the Sotto posti, who were previously hopeful for better rights and social/professional advances, into opponents of the Signoria, aligning their aims and ailments with those of the lower class Ciompi. Salvestro de Medici was one of the individuals assigned the blame by many in the lower classes, and later also faced accusation from his peers for letting the situation with the Ciompi get out of hand.

====Reform====
On 22 June 1378, the first outbreak of violence occurred when the un-guilded wool-workers took up arms and attacked government buildings, monasteries and a number of Palazzi whilst also releasing inmates from city prisons. Nevertheless, it was yet to become a full blown revolt. The Signoria attempted to appease the lower classes through talks and petitions, although ultimately suggested little change and still left the Ciompi guildless and without power or representation in government. The procrastination of the Signoria and half measures adopted therefore is perhaps what contributed to the second phase of the revolt.

====Revolt====
On 21 July, the lower classes forcibly took over the government, placing the wool carder Michele di Lando in the executive office of gonfaloniere of justice, and showing their banner, the blacksmith&#x27;s flag, at the Bargello, the palace of the podestà. On this day, thousands of armed wool workers (the Ciompi) and those from the Sotto posti, besieged the Signoria and pointedly hanged the public executioner by his feet in front of the Palazzo Vecchio. The Ciompi then compelled the governing body, the Signoria, to establish three additional guilds in order to grant them access to political office. In demanding the creation of an &quot;arte del pololo minuto&quot;, the Ciompi requests were not especially radical: they were simply demanding the same rights the other minor guilds currently had. Most of the Ciompi (and Sotto Posti involved) aimed for reform rather than radical or revolutionary innovation. The total membership of the three new guilds was roughly 13,000 men whereas the twenty-one previously existing guilds had a membership of about 4000 to 5000 between them. After the incorporation of these new guilds, almost every man in Florence was able to participate in city government.

Considering the militancy with which the Ciompi had seized power, their demands both politically and socially, were modest. Their main concerns included the formation of a guild for wool workers and they also wished to tackle unemployment by increasing wool production. The Ciompi in fact did not demand ownership of cloth production or the cloth factories and their ideals were still based around the traditional guild idea, wishing to protect their economic interests and the situation of their workers.

However the new Ciompi government, once they had pushed out the Signoria, experienced early problems. While they made demands such as the right to elect three of their own priors, the reduction of judicial corporal punishment, and reform of the tax system, the new government was rather weak and lacked strong bargaining skills. An analysis of those within the newly appointed Balia suggests that only half were actually Ciompi, the rest being of middle class and other professions. The clash of interests and resulting struggle and sense of betrayal experienced by the Ciompi when their leader Michele di Lando turned against them, ignoring their demands, led to the third stage of the revolt.

====Reaction====
At the end of August 1378, factionalism among the Ciompi and the radical persecution of enemies of the revolution, led di Lando to arrest two Ciompi leaders who had demanded constitutional reform. The next day, di Lando rode out of the palace with the standard bearer of justice and cleared the piazza of a militia from the three new guilds who were shouting &quot;Long live the popolo minuto&quot; and demanding the resignation of di Lando&#x27;s government. The workers&#x27; militia returned and a battle for the Piazza della Signoria broke out between the Ciompi and the forces of the major and minor guilds led by the guild of butchers. The Ciompi and Sotto posti were slaughtered that day by the other guilds alongside the reformist forces under previous Ciompi leader di Lando, who also acted to crush the Eight Saints who were attempting to challenge his power in government. This day has been named one of the bloodiest in Florentine history.

On 1 September citizens assembled in the piazza and approved the dissolution of the Ciompi guild. Nevertheless, the government continued to enact Ciompi-led reforms, such as the establishment of the &quot;estimo&quot;—a direct tax on household wealth on 29 October 1378. Overall, the Ciompi revolt consisted of complex social, economic and political factors, as well as the involvement of more than one group of workers such as the Ciompi. The hierarchical guild system played an important part in the conflict, as did guild members who were key in turning on the government and ending its short reign over the city. Although often portrayed as radical today, the demands and wishes of the wool workers and others involved were fairly modest and reform did not take the shape of a societal overhaul. The idea that the Ciompi could live harmoniously with all the other groups and guilds in society after they assumed government, however, was idealistic. Furthermore, the disillusionment experienced when the conflict continued especially after the collapse of the regime and the guilds dissolution certainly contributed to the decline of labour unrest in Florence&#x27;s cloth industry in the years following and lack of political power that these sections of society continued to have.

==Key figures==

===Salvestro de&#x27; Medici===

As &quot;a man of a noble house, great and rich&quot;, Salvestro de&#x27; Medici was a lesser known cousin to the famous House of Medici banking family. He was blamed for causing the rebellion of the Ciompi by his peers (such as Alamanno Acciaioli, who was part of the Signory that brought the papal war to an end). Salvestro made an error in his struggle against the Guelf party, thus spoiling his family image as well as others of similar rank, &quot;subjecting them to the rashness of the excited multitude&quot;.

===&quot;The Eight (Saints)&quot;===

Very little is actually known about &quot;The Eight (Saints)&quot; and who the members were. Trexler calls the radical Ciompi rebel group &quot;Gli Otto Santi del Popolo di Dio&quot; (or the &quot;Eight Saints&quot;, also known as the Eight of Santa Maria Novella) and suggests that they may be commonly confused with the more influential and better known &quot;otto della guerra&quot; (or the &quot;Eight of War&quot;) who represented Florence and opposed Gregory XI and the Catholic Church in 1375 (in the War of the Eight Saints). The &quot;Eight of War&quot; were very much in power at the time of the Ciompi Revolt, however they played a very small role during the actual Ciompi Revolt. The &quot;Eight Saints&quot; of the &quot;Popolo Minuto&quot; created itself as a shadow government to Michele di Lando&#x27;s government they forcefully obtained the right to veto communal legislation. Di Lando&#x27;s government defeated these radical challengers on 31 August 1378.

===Michele di Lando===
There is very little recorded history about who Michele di Lando was before the Ciompi Revolt, because men of the lower working class did not leave behind major documents. What is known is that he was a woolcomber, his mother was a washerwoman, and his wife ran a pork butcher&#x27;s shop. Within his industry, di Lando was the foreman of all the menial workers and made enough money to show up in tax records as paying small sums. He was also a &quot;caporale&quot; during the war of Papal States, he shared command over twenty-eight men with another &quot;caporale&quot; (It is not known if he saw active service at that time, but the fact that he was trained in command and with arms, he was likely less docile than simple workers in his industry).

His ascension to the position of &quot;Signore&quot; and &quot;Gonfaloniere&quot; was literally a story about a man who went from rags to riches. He walked into the Palace barefooted and took control at the people&#x27;s request. This scene inspired awe even in the eyes of some of the Signory (despite their compromised position). Alamanno Acciaioli was quoted saying, &quot;... He [di Lando] was given the Signory and they [the people] wished him to be Standard-Bearer of Justice and lord (signore)... this Michele di Lando, wool comber, was lord of Florence for twenty-eight hours and more. This is the result of quarrelsomeness and innovation! O dear Lord, what great miracles you show us!...&quot; Upon Michele di Lando&#x27;s ascension to power, the &quot;Eight of War&quot; (who thought themselves as effective rulers of Florence) wanted to appoint replacements for the Signory. Di Lando dismissed them, wanting to show that he could govern without their assistance, and chose the electoral candidates himself. Once he secured his power, di Lando&#x27;s government allied with the &quot;Popolo di Firenze&quot;, infuriating radical members of the &quot;Popolo Minuto&quot; (who elected their &quot;Eight Saints&quot; to oppose di Lando). After the final clash with the radicals, the Signory retook office at the end of Michele di Lando&#x27;s term. This regime did not last long, it was overthrown again in 1382 and di Lando was sent into exile as a collaborator with the Signory.

==Revolt&#x27;s end, reflection, and impact==

===End of Ciompi control===
The city of Florence was governed by the Ciompi until 1382 when fear of foreign incursion and a prolonged dispute between the wool merchants and the dyers was used to justify an intervention by the elite families on behalf of a disintegrating government. Delegitimizing the new established guilds and removing them from constitutional functions became a main objective of the post-1382 regime that repealed the guild government&#x27;s reforms. City government engaged in a concerted campaign to depict the non-guilded workers as criminal and heretical.

The Ciompi Rebellion was not particularly long, lasting only for three and a half years (1378–1382). Yet, it not only reflected the long-existing social issue of late 14th-century Florence, but also constituted a long-lasting impact on many generations to come. It greatly influenced Florentine society in the 15th century, and became a memorable moment of Florentine history, which historians of later centuries all showed great interest in, but interpreted the same event in a variety of different ways.

===Reflection on problems in late 14th-century Florence===

Late 14th-century Florence was not a harmonious city, but one that had long been filled with tensions. The two major tensions were social and political, accumulating since Florence&#x27;s commercial revolution 150 years prior to the rebellion. Social tension existed between the poor Ciompi and wealthy merchants who dominated the lucrative wool industry, and the Florentine government, which continued to increase taxation. The political tension was between the Ciompi, gente nuova, and the oligarchy, with the former two challenging the latter for more participation in government. The Ciompi Rebellion was the eruption of these long-existing tensions, which could no longer be contained.

===Impacts on 15th-century Florence===

After the Ciompi Uprising, the restored Florentine government did attempt to alleviate the plight of Ciompi artisans, such as a reform to lessen the burden of taxation. Yet, the rebellion left a permanent scar in the Florentine elites&#x27; mind (both the new and the old nobility) and created their everlasting fear and hatred toward the Ciompi. This scar built a tension between the new nobility and the lower labouring class greater than that prior to the uprising, as the elites constantly feared the rabble&#x27;s secret plots. The elites thus began to favour a more authoritative government, which may be more centralized and stronger in crushing a revolt. This eventually gave rise to the Medici family, the most powerful banking family of Florence, whose power outweighed Salvestro de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s bad reputation, and became the de facto ruler of Florence in the 15th century, drastically changing the character of the Florentine communal government.

===Impacts on historians from different eras===

In the 15th century, it would not be surprising for Florentine scholars, who were part of the elite, to view the uprising negatively. Leonardo Bruni regarded the uprising as a mob out of control, whose members viciously looted and murdered the innocent. He viewed this event as a historical cautionary tale, which presented the horrendous consequence when rabbles managed to seize control from the ruling class.

In the 16th century, Niccolò Machiavelli harbored a somewhat different view than Bruni. Although he echoed Bruni&#x27;s perspective, also referring to them as the mob, the rabbles, preoccupied by fear and hatred, he was more favorable than Bruni in viewing the event as a whole. According to Machiavelli, the revolt was a social phenomenon between one group of people, who were determined to obtain freedom, while the other determined to abolish it.

In the 19th century, however, historians began to show sympathy to the Ciompi. Romantic historians had a tendency to interpret history as an epic tale between the evil and good, and this applied to the Ciompi Rebellion. Romantic historians regarded Michele di Lando, the leader of the rebellion, as a hero to the people who fought against their ruthless oppressors. In the late nineteenth century, a sculpture of the popular leader Michele di Lando was placed in a niche on the façade of the Loggia del Mercato Nuovo. Marxist historians also sympathized with the Ciompi artisans, viewing them as the early proletariat, who tried to overthrow the oppressive bourgeoisies.

Recent histories treat the conflict as a lens reflecting the issues of Florentine society in the late 14th century, and also as a catalyst for Florence&#x27;s period politics. Moreover, to them, the rebellion is a lens that reflects history as an ever changing entity, as historians living in different times have different &quot;presents&quot;, and one&#x27;s present dictates how one views the past.

<text>The Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-30 (Russian: Грязев-Шипунов ГШ-6-30) is a Russian 30 mm rotary cannon aircraft-mounted and naval autocannon used by Soviet and later CIS military aircraft. The GSh-6-30 fires a 30×165mm, projectile.

==Description==
The GSh-6-30, designed in the early 1970s and entering service in 1975, has a six barrel design that is similar to the Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23. It was based on the naval AO-18 used in the AK-630 system. Unlike most modern rotary cannons, it is gas-operated rather than hydraulically driven, allowing it to &quot;spin up&quot; to maximum rate of fire more quickly, allowing more rounds to be placed on target in a short-duration burst. This makes the weapon advantageous in dogfights, where pilots often have a very small window for engaging the enemy. Ignition is electrical, as with the smaller GSh-6-23.

On the MiG-27 &quot;Flogger&quot; the GSh-6-30 had to be mounted obliquely to absorb recoil. The gun was noted for its high (often uncomfortable) vibration and extreme noise. The airframe vibration led to fatigue cracks in fuel tanks, numerous radio and avionics failures, the necessity of using runways with floodlights for night flights (as the landing lights would often be destroyed), tearing or jamming of the forward landing gear doors (leading to at least three crash landings), cracking of the reflector gunsight, an accidental jettisoning of the cockpit canopy and at least one case of the instrument panel falling off in flight. The weapons also dealt extensive collateral damage, as the sheer numbers of fragments from detonating shells was sufficient to damage aircraft flying within a 200-meter radius from the impact center, including the aircraft firing.

The principal application for the GSh-6-30 is the MiG-27, which carries the weapon in a gondola under the fuselage, primarily for strafing and ground attack. It was fitted to some Su-25TM aircraft, but subsequently replaced with the GSh-30-2 twin-barreled autocannon of the original Su-25. It is also used as the gun component of the CADS-N-1 Kashtan close-in weapon system.

==Variants==
*GSh-6-30M; 
*AO-18L; version used by ABM-BCM30 remote weapon station.
*GSh-6-30K; Naval variant of GSh-6-30, also known as AO-18 used in AK-630 CIWS system.
*AO-18K; Modernized AO-18 used by Kashtan CIWS.
*AO-18KD; Further improved AO-18K with a higher rate of fire and extended range used in AK-630M2, Palma/Palash and Pantsir-M CIWS systems.

<doc id="1097863" wikidata="Q7531271" url="?curid=1097863" title="Sisters (Lynne Cheney novel)">
<text>Sisters is a 1981 novel by Lynne Cheney published only in a Signet Canadian paperback edition as part of the New American Library (). &quot;Sisters&quot; is a historical novel set in Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1886. Sophie Dymond, a magazine editor in New York City, comes home to Cheyenne after the death of her sister, Helen. The novel is a historical and literary portrayal of the status of women in the Old West. In the novel, Sophie finds a letter that Amy Travers, a schoolteacher and close friend of Helen&#x27;s, had written to her:
Helen, my joy and my beloved, Why do we stay? I have no reason beyond a few pupils who would miss me briefly, and your life would be infinitely better away from him. Let us go away together, away from the anger and imperatives of men. We shall find ourselves a secluded bower where they dare not venture. There will be only the two of us, and we shall linger through long afternoons of sweet retirement. In the evenings I shall read to you while you work your cross-stitch in the firelight. And then we shall go to bed, our bed, my dearest girl. . . . The &quot;him&quot; referred to in the letter is apparently Helen&#x27;s husband, James Stevenson.

Later in the book, the author writes of Sophie&#x27;s impressions on seeing Amy Travers and another woman, Lydia Swerdlow, with their arms around each other: The women who embraced in the wagon were Adam and Eve on a dark cathedral stage--no, Eve and Eve, loving one another as they would not be able to once they ate of the fruit and knew themselves as they truly were. She felt curiously moved, curiously envious of them. . . . she saw that the women in the cart had a passionate, loving intimacy forever closed to her. How strong it made them. What comfort it gave.

==Legacy==
The book is now out of print. Existing copies have been put up for sale on eBay, amazon.com, and various other Internet sites for prices ranging, at this writing (September 26, 2009), from $49.96 to $295.00 unsigned, and $1,500 for a copy autographed by Cheney.

In 2004, New American Library announced that it planned to republish the book. However, after being contacted by Lynne Cheney&#x27;s attorney, Robert Barnett, who reportedly told them that Cheney did not consider the book her &quot;best work,&quot; New American Library announced in April 2004 that it would not be republishing the book after all.

In a February 9, 2005 interview on NPR with Terry Gross, Cheney denied that &quot;Sisters&quot; contained a lesbian relationship. Cheney suggested that the relationship between the two characters was in question and a historical mystery. She also suggested that &quot;Sisters&quot; was her one bad book, written in an &quot;attempt to take the novel &quot;Rebecca&quot; (by Daphne du Maurier) and put it in a Western setting.&quot;

In an interview that took place on October 27, 2006 with Wolf Blitzer on CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, Cheney denied that &quot;Sisters&quot; contained rape or graphic depictions of lesbian sex.

&quot;Sisters&quot; and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s novel &quot;Zabibah and the King&quot; are the subject of Taylor Mac&#x27;s satirical song The Palace of the End.

<text>The following is a list of airlines that operate the [[Boeing 777]].

The Boeing 777 is a long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliner designed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the commercial business unit of Boeing. Commonly referred to as the &quot;Triple Seven&quot;, it is the largest twinjet. The 777 can accommodate between 301 and 450 (Air Canada High Density) passengers in a three-class layout, and has a range of , depending on the model. Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, the 777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge the capacity difference between the 767 and 747.

The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths. The original 777-200 model first entered service in 1995, followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997. The stretched 777-300, which is longer, began service in 1998. The longer-range 777-300ER and 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006, respectively, while a freighter version, the 777F, debuted in 2009.

United Airlines first placed the 777 into commercial airline service in 1995. The most successful variant is the 777-300ER with 799 aircraft delivered and over 844 orders to date. Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet with 148 aircraft. FedEx Express operates the largest fleet of the 777F cargo aircraft. As of April 2024, 2,268 Boeing 777s, of all variants, have been ordered and 1,729 have been delivered.
==Model summary==
United Airlines placed the launch order for the 777 program on October 14, 1990 when it purchased 34 Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4084-powered 777-200s valued at US$11 billion with options on an additional 34. The 777-200 entered into service with United Airlines on June 7, 1995 with its first flight from London Heathrow Airport to Dulles International Airport. From day one, the 777 was awarded 180-minute ETOPS clearance by the Federal Aviation Administration, making it the first airliner to carry an ETOPS-180 clearance into service. This would later be increased to 207 minutes by October 1996. British Airways placed the first model with General Electric GE90-77B engines into service on November 17, 1995. The first Rolls-Royce Trent 877-powered aircraft was delivered to Thai Airways International on March 31, 1996, completing the introduction of the three power-plants initially developed for the airliner.

Subsequent versions of the 777, including the 777-200ER, 777-200LR, 777-300, 777-300ER, 777F and the upcoming 777-8X and -9X, have been launched by Air France, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, and Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). The following table lists milestone dates for each model of the aircraft.

In July 2009, Emirates surpassed Singapore Airlines as the biggest 777 operator, when the 78th aircraft was delivered. Since 2010, Emirates is the largest Boeing 777 operator, with 152 aircraft; the carrier began phasing out older −200s, −200ERs and −300s in February 2011. Other primary operators are United Airlines (96), Qatar Airways (81), Air France (70), American Airlines (67), and Cathay Pacific (65). As of November 2011, 62 airline customers operated variants of the Boeing 777.

<text>Robert Malcolm Simcock (born 1947) is a New Zealand politician. He was a Member of Parliament for the National Party from 1996 to 2002 and Mayor of Hamilton from 2007 to 2010.

==Early career==
Simcock attended St John&#x27;s College before graduating from the University of Waikato with a M Soc Sci (Hons).
Before entering politics, Simcock worked both as a deer farmer and as a clinical psychologist.

==Member of Parliament==


Simcock was an MP from 1996 to 2002, representing the National Party. He was first elected in the 1996 election as MP for Hamilton West, defeating the incumbent, Martin Gallagher of the Labour Party. In the 1999 election, Gallagher retook the seat from Simcock, who returned to Parliament as a list MP. In the 2002 election, Simcock again trailed Gallagher in Hamilton West, and National Party votes nationwide dropped enough that Simcock was not re-elected as a list MP.

==Local government==
Simcock was elected to the Hamilton City Council for the West Ward in the 2004 election and appointed Deputy Mayor that year. Following Michael Redman&#x27;s resignation, he was appointed Mayor of Hamilton in May 2007. He was elected mayor in the October 2007 election with over 50% of the votes cast. He lost the 2010 mayoral election to Julie Hardaker.

Simcock was elected to the Waikato Regional Council in 2013 and re-elected in 2016.

==Other activities==
Simcock was appointed as the chair of the Waikato District Health Board by the Minister of Health in 2013. He resigned as chair and board member on 28 November 2017, following the resignation of Waikato DHB chief executive Nigel Murray, amidst a State Services Commission investigation into allegations of wrongful expenditure of public money by Murray. Murray was seen as Simcock&#x27;s appointment by former CEO Craig Climo; Climo and former Labour MP Sue Moroney said they advised against hiring Dr Murray.

<doc id="1097878" wikidata="Q489950" url="?curid=1097878" title="Kim Ho">
<text>Kim Ho (; born 24 November 1944) is a South Korean former football player and manager.

== Early life ==
Kim was born in Tongyeong, a coastal city of South Korea, and started football in his hometown. He originally joined Tongyeong High School when he became old enough to join a high school, but there was no football club. He transferred to Jinju High School the next year to learn football professionally. However, he experienced a slump in Jinju, and once again moved to another school, Dongnae High School in Busan. Kim respected the Dongnae&#x27;s manager An Jong-soo, and followed him into a semi-professional club Cheil Industries instead of university.

== International career ==
Kim was on the South Korea national team from 1966 to 1972, and won the 1970 Asian Games. He originally played as a right back, but he showed his best performance as a centre-back. He was noted for his rapid pace and wild defense, and showed a great harmony with Kim Jung-nam, his partner centre-back.

== Managerial career ==
=== Early career ===

Kim took his first steps into coaching with his team Commercial Bank. He started to perform the managerial role in his alma mater Dongnae High School before taking over as coach of a semi-professional club Hanil Bank in 1983. Under Kim, Hanil Bank won the Korean Semi-professional League straight away, qualifying for the professional league, K League.

However, Hanil Bank turned its status into a semipro club again in 1987, and Kim left for a K League club Hyundai Horang-i the next year. He rejuvenated Hyundai in his first season by leading them to a second place finish, but couldn&#x27;t sustain the result after that. Hyundai slipped down to the bottom in 1989, and remained second from bottom in 1990. He finally left Hyundai prior to the 1991 season.

=== South Korea ===
Kim was back in management when he took over the rein of the South Korean national team in July 1992, and led it to the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. His team put up some credible performances, drawing its opener 2–2 with Spain. However, South Korea drew its second game without a goal against Bolivia, facing the danger of being eliminated in the group stage. In the last group game against Germany, South Korea closed the gap to 3–2 after being 3–0 down at half-time. Kim and Koreans showed their effort against the World Cup holders, but it was inadequate to advance to the next round.

=== Suwon Samsung Bluewings ===
After stepping down as national manager, Kim was contacted by a new K League club Suwon Samsung Bluewings to become the first-ever manager of the club. He lifted 13 trophies including two K Leagues and two Asian Club Championships for eight years with Suwon. He also nurtured and discovered young talents called the &quot;Kim Ho&#x27;s Children&quot;. Many of them had successful careers in the K League even after his resignation. Ko Jong-soo and Kim Do-heon played for the national team among his pupils. He announced his retirement at the end of 2003.

=== Daejeon Citizen ===
Kim joined Daejeon Citizen in 2007, canceling his retirement. He had been regarded as one of the greatest South Korean managers before his return, but lost his honor by courting controversies in Daejeon. Kim was in conflict with the president and the board of directors due to team&#x27;s financial problem as well as his poor results. Furthermore, the club&#x27;s agent who was having a close relationship with Kim suffered discredit for embezzlement. Kim was finally removed from the team with the president in 2009.

Kim had finished his managerial career, but caused controversies again in Daejeon after 10 years. He was appointed the president of Daejeon Citizen in 2017 despite previous conflict, and engaged a significant number of his acquaintances as manager, agent, and players without principle. Daejeon Citizen was owned by the Daejeon Government at the time, and its finance was relying on the citizens&#x27; precious tax money. Kim received many criticisms, leaving Daejeon in 2019. Ko Jong-soo, the club&#x27;s manager of the time and Kim&#x27;s disciple, faced a court the next year.

<text>Gennady Nikolayevich Rozhdestvensky, CBE (; 4 May 1931 – 16 June 2018) was a Soviet and Russian conductor, pianist, composer, and pedagogue.

==Biography==
Gennady Rozhdestvensky was born in Moscow. His parents were the noted conductor and pedagogue Nikolai Anosov and soprano Natalya Rozhdestvenskaya. His given name was Gennady Nikolayevich Anosov, but he adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name in its masculine form for his professional career so as to avoid the appearance of nepotism. His younger brother, the painter P.N. Anosov, retained their father&#x27;s name.

He studied conducting with his father at the Moscow Conservatory and piano with Lev Oborin. Already known for having conducted Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre at the age of 20, he quickly established his reputation. He premiered many works by Soviet composers, including Edison Denisov&#x27;s &quot;Le soleil des Incas&quot; (&quot;The Sun of the Incas&quot;; 1964), as well as giving the Russian premiere of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and the Western premiere of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Fourth Symphony at the 1962 Edinburgh Festival.

He became general artistic director of the Bolshoi Theatre in 2000, and in 2001 conducted the world premiere of the original version of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s opera &quot;The Gambler&quot;. Not long afterwards he resigned, citing desertion by singers, production problems and hostile coverage by the Moscow press.

Among the works dedicated to Rozhdestvensky are Sofia Gubaidulina&#x27;s symphony &quot;Stimmen... Verstummen...&quot; and several of Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s works, such as Symphony No. 1, Symphony No. 8, and Symphony No. 9. Schnittke wrote of him:

:I once calculated that there are now some forty compositions written for Rozhdestvensky—either derived from his ideas or else he was the first to conduct them. I could not believe it, but it really is so. I could even say that nearly all my own work as a composer depended on contact with him and on the many talks we had. It was in these talks that I conceived the idea for many of my compositions. I count that as one of the luckiest circumstances of my life.

==Conducting==
Rozhdestvensky was considered a versatile conductor and a highly cultured musician with a supple stick technique. In moulding his interpretations, he gave a clear idea of the structural outlines and emotional content of a piece, combined with a performing style which melded logic, intuition and spontaneity. In the Soviet Union, he recorded extensively with the big three major contemporary soloists David Oistrakh (violin), Sviatoslav Richter (piano) and Mstislav Rostropovich (cello).

Rozhdestvensky is featured in the documentary &quot;Notes interdites: scènes de la vie musicale en Russie Soviétique&quot; (English title: &quot;The Red Baton&quot;), which examines the hardships faced by musicians in the Soviet Union under Stalinism. In it, he describes the political situation and its impact on his life, as well as those of Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, Richter and other colleagues. The role of Tikhon Khrennikov, Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers, is discussed extensively. As well, the documentary features Rozhdestvensky discussing the art of conducting, and includes footage of masterclasses, rehearsals with students from the Moscow Conservatory and Zürich&#x27;s &quot;Tonhalle&quot; orchestra, as well as snippets of Rozhdestvensky conducting Shostakovich&#x27;s 7th Symphony, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;.

==Shostakovich interpreter==
In 2016, Rozhdestvensky was awarded the 7th International Shostakovich Prize for his contribution to the interpretation of the work of Dmitri Shostakovich. At Edinburgh in 1964, he conducted the first performance outside the Soviet Union of the 4th symphony. His 1983 recording of the 8th symphony is considered a classic. He edited the second volume of the collected works of Shostakovich published in 1984, including the Symphony No. 3 and Symphony No. 4.

==Personal life==
Rozhdestvensky was married twice. His first marriage was to the ballerina Nina Timofeeva. In 1969, Rozhdestvensky married the pianist Viktoria Postnikova. Together they recorded Tchaikovsky&#x27;s piano concertos. Their son, Sasha Rozhdestvensky, is a violinist, with whom Rozhdestvensky senior recorded the Glazunov and Shostakovich violin concertos in 2007.

Rozhdestvensky was named a People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR in 1976, and a Hero of Socialist Labour in 1990. He died on 16 June 2018.

<text>The Kaliningrad K-5 (NATO reporting name AA-1 &quot;Alkali&quot;), also known as RS-1U or product ShM, was an early Soviet air-to-air missile.

==History==
The development of the K-5 began in 1951. The first test firings were in 1953. It was tested (but not operationally carried) by the Yakovlev Yak-25. The weapon entered service as the Grushin/Tomashevich () RS-2U (also known as the R-5MS or K-5MS) in 1957. The initial version was matched to the RP-2U (Izumrud-2) radar used on the MiG-17PFU, MiG-19PM. An improved variant, K-5M or RS-2US in PVO service, entered production in 1959, matched to the RP-9/RP-9U (Sapfir) radar of the Sukhoi Su-9. The People&#x27;s Republic of China developed a copy under the designation PL-1, for use by their J-6B fighters.

The difficulties associated with beam-riding guidance, particularly in a single-seat fighter aircraft, were substantial, making the &#x27;Alkali&#x27; primarily a short-range anti-bomber missile. Around 1967 the K-5 was replaced by the K-55 (R-55 in service), which replaced the beam-riding seeker with the semi-active radar homing or infrared seekers of the K-13 (AA-2 &#x27;Atoll&#x27;). The weapon was heavier than the K-5, but had a smaller warhead. The K-55 remained in service until about 1977, probably being retired with the last of the Sukhoi Su-9 interceptors.

<doc id="1097896" wikidata="Q411903" url="?curid=1097896" title="Ajahn Brahm">
<text>Phra Visuddhisamvarathera (), known as Ajahn Brahmavaṃso, or simply Ajahn Brahm (born Peter Betts on 7 August 1951), is a British-born Buddhist monk. Ordained in 1974, he trained in the Thai Forest Tradition of Theravada Buddhism under his teacher Ajahn Chah. Currently, Ajahn Brahm is the abbot of Bodhinyana Monastery in Serpentine, Western Australia, as well as an adviser or patron of various Buddhist organizations in Australia, Singapore, and the UK.

==Early life==
Peter Betts was born in London. He came from a working-class background and went to Latymer Upper School. He won a scholarship to study theoretical physics at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge in the late 1960s. After graduation, he taught mathematics at a high school in Devon for one year before travelling to Thailand to become a monk and train with Ajahn Chah Bodhinyana Mahathera. Brahm was ordained in Bangkok at the age of twenty-three by Somdet Kiaw, the abbot of Wat Saket. He subsequently spent nine years studying and training in the forest meditation tradition under Ajahn Chah.

==Bodhinyana Monastery==
After practicing for nine years as a monk, Ajahn Brahm was sent to Perth by Ajahn Chah in 1983 to assist Ajahn Jagaro in teaching duties. Initially, they both lived in an old house on Magnolia Street, in the suburb of North Perth, but in late 1983, they purchased 97 acres (393,000 m²) of rural and forested land in the hills of Serpentine, south of Perth. The land was to become Bodhinyana Monastery (named after their teacher, Ajahn Chah Bodhinyana). Bodhinyana was to become the first dedicated Buddhist monastery of the Thai Theravada lineage in the Southern Hemisphere and is today the largest community of Buddhist monks in Australia. Initially, there were no buildings on the land and as there were only a few Buddhists in Perth at this time, and little funding, the monks themselves began building to save money. Ajahn Brahm learnt plumbing and bricklaying and built many of the current buildings himself.
In 1994, Ajahn Jagaro took a sabbatical leave from Western Australia and disrobed a year later. Left in charge, Ajahn Brahm took on the role and was soon being invited to provide his teachings in other parts of Australia and Southeast Asia. He has been a speaker at the International Buddhist Summit in Phnom Penh in 2002 and at three Global Conferences on Buddhism. He also dedicates time and attention to the sick and dying, those in prison or ill with cancer, people wanting to learn to meditate, and also to his Sangha of monks at Bodhinyana. Ajahn Brahm has also been influential in establishing Dhammasara Nuns&#x27; Monastery at Gidgegannup in the hills northeast of Perth to be a wholly independent monastery, which is jointly administered by Ayya Nirodha and Venerable Hasapañña.

==Bhikkhuni ordination==
On 22 October 2009, Ajahn Brahm, along with Bhante Sujato, facilitated an ordination ceremony for bhikkhunis, where four female Buddhists, Venerable Ajahn Vayama, and Venerables Nirodha, Seri, and Hasapañña, were ordained into the Western Theravada Bhikkhuni Sangha, with Venerable Tathālokā Bhikkhunī serving as Bhikkhunī Preceptor. The ordination ceremony took place at Ajahn Brahm&#x27;s Bodhinyana Monastery at Serpentine, Australia. Although bhikkhuni ordinations had taken place in California and Sri Lanka, this was the first in the Thai Forest Tradition and proved highly controversial in Thailand. There is no consensus in the wider tradition that bhikkhuni ordinations could be valid, having last been performed in Thailand over 1,000 years ago, though the matter has been under active discussion for some time. Ajahn Brahm claims that there is no valid historical basis for denying ordination to bhikkunis.

For his actions of 22 October 2009, on 1 November 2009, at a meeting of senior members of the Thai forest monastic Sangha in the Ajahn Chah lineage, held at Wat Pah Pong, Ubon Ratchathani, Brahm was removed from the Ajahn Chah Forest Sangha lineage and is no longer associated with the main monastery in Thailand, Wat Pah Pong, nor with any of the other Western Forest Sangha branch monasteries of the Ajahn Chah tradition.

==Anukampa Bhikkhuni Project==
In October 2015, Ajahn Brahm asked Venerable Candā of Dhammasara Nun&#x27;s Monastery, Perth, to take steps towards establishing a monastery in the UK. In response to this, Anukampa Bhikkhuni Project was born. Anukampa Bhikkhuni Project aims to promote the teachings and practices of early Buddhism by establishing a Bhikkhuni presence in the UK. Its long-term aspiration is to develop a monastery with a harmonious and meditative atmosphere, for women who wish to train towards full ordination.

==LGBT support==
Ajahn Brahm has openly spoken about his support towards same-sex marriage. At a conference in Singapore in 2014, he said he was very proud to have been able to perform a same-sex marriage blessing for a couple in Norway, and stressed that Buddhist teachings do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.

==Rohingya crisis==
In 2015, during the Rohingya refugee crisis, the Buddhist Society of Western Australia donated money to support displaced orphans in Bangladesh. Speaking at the ceremony, Ajahn Brahm said:

==Kindfulness==
In an effort to reclaim the &quot;mindfulness&quot; practice from being overrun by secular industries and a recent claim that it is not owned by Buddhism, Ajahn Brahm clarifies that mindfulness is a practice within the rest of the supporting factors of Buddhism (the Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right motivation, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right endeavor, right mindfulness, and right stillness). According to the monk, mindfulness is part of a great training called Buddhism, and to actually take away mindfulness from Buddhism is unhelpful, inaccurate, and deceiving—mindfulness is a cultural heritage of Buddhism. Practicing mindfulness without wisdom and compassion is not enough. Therefore, drawing from the Pāli Suttas, Ajahn Brahm created the term &quot;Kindfulness&quot;, meaning mindfulness combined with wisdom and compassion—mindfulness combined with knowing the ethical and moral compassionate consequences of the reactions to what is happening (a.k.a. satisampajañña).

==Achievements==
Whilst still a junior monk, Ajahn Brahm was asked to undertake the compilation of an English-language guide to the Buddhist monastic code—the vinaya. Currently, Brahm is the Abbot of Bodhinyana Monastery in Serpentine, Western Australia, the Spiritual Director of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia, Spiritual Adviser to the Buddhist Society of Victoria, Spiritual Adviser to the Buddhist Society of South Australia, Spiritual Patron of the Buddhist Fellowship in Singapore and most recently, Spiritual Adviser to the Anukampa Bhikkhuni Project in the UK. He returned to the office of Spiritual Director of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia on 22 April 2018, after briefly resigning in March, following a contentious vote by members of the BSWA during their annual general meeting.

In October 2004, Ajahn Brahm was awarded the John Curtin medal for his vision, leadership, and service to the Australian community, by Curtin University.

Under the auspices of the Diamond Jubilee of King Rama IX, Bhumibol Adulyadej, in June 2006, Ajahn Brahm was given the title of Phra Visuddhisamvarathera.

On 5 September 2019, Ajahn Brahm was awarded the Order of Australia, General Division medal, for services to Buddhism and gender equality. The investiture was performed at Government House Western Australia.

<text>Anthony Gordon Steel (31 July 1941 – 4 May 2018) was a New Zealand rugby union player, politician and educator.

==Early years==
He was born in Greymouth, and played rugby first for his school, Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School, and then for Canterbury before finally playing for the All Blacks between 1966 and 1968. He was a part of the All Blacks 1967 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, France and Canada.

After retiring from sport due to injury, he took up teaching, first at the Brisbane Grammar School and then back in New Zealand. He eventually became headmaster of Hamilton Boys&#x27; High School.

==Member of Parliament==


In the 1990 election, he stood for Parliament as a candidate for the National Party, defeating Labour&#x27;s Bill Dillon in the Hamilton East electorate. In the 1993 election, however, he was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Dianne Yates. He regained the seat in the 1996 election, and retained it in the 1999 election, but in the 2002 election, he was defeated again by Dianne Yates. Having opted not to seek a position on National&#x27;s party list, Steel left Parliament. Testament to Steel&#x27;s popularity in the city of Hamilton is the fact that he lost what has traditionally been regarded as a bellwether seat by a mere 600 votes, in an election where the National Party was almost destroyed by its lowest polling result in recent history.

==Death==
Steel died in Hamilton on 4 May 2018.

==Legacy==
In 2000, an extra house was added at Hamilton Boys&#x27; High School, named Steel house, after Tony Steel. Apart from Argyle House (the boarding house), all of the other houses are also named after former Headmasters.
Tony Steel also won the New Zealand 100/200metres Sprint double at the 1965-66 New Zealand Track and Field Championships representing Canterbury as well as being a member of the winning Canterbury 4x100 metres Team that took Gold

<doc id="1097916" wikidata="Q509716" url="?curid=1097916" title="Manly, New South Wales">
<text>Manly is a beach-side suburb of northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is north-east of the Sydney central business district and is currently one of the three administrative centres of the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. Manly has a long-standing reputation as a tourist destination, owing to its attractive setting on the Pacific Ocean and easy accessibility by ferry.

==History==

Manly was named by Captain Arthur Phillip for the Indigenous people living there, stating that &quot;their confidence and manly behaviour made me give the name of Manly Cove to this place&quot;. These men were of the Kay-ye-my clan (of the Dharug-speaking Gayemaygal people). While scouting for fresh water in the area, Phillip encountered members of the clan, and after a kidnapping he was speared in the shoulder by one of the clan as a punishment ritual; the progressively-minded Phillip ordered his men not to retaliate. In Capt. Tench&#x27;s words,
The Aboriginal men were feasting on a whale at Manly Cove and were seen by Captain Nepean, Mr White, Nanbaree &amp; a party of men who had travelled to Manly Cove to walk to Broken Bay. Bennelong and Colebee spoke to them and Bennelong asked for Governor Phillip. Captain Nepean sent the Boatswain back to Governor Phillip at South Head. The Aboriginal men cut large chunks of whale off and put them in the boat for Governor Phillip. The military party then proceeded on their walk to Broken Bay.

When Governor Phillip&#x27;s party arrived to see the Aboriginal men they held friendly conversation with Bennelong and Colebee for over half an hour. Later an older Aboriginal man appeared with a spear. Captain Tench remarked that he was seemingly a stranger and little acquainted with Bennelong and Colebee. The Governor moved towards this man and the man became agitated. Governor Phillip threw down his dirk to appease the man crying out confidently. The spear was thrown and Governor Phillip was hit in the shoulder. All was in confusion, there were calls to bring the muskets, Bennelong and Colebee disappeared and Governor Phillip could not make it to the ship because of the length of spear sticking from his shoulder and dragging on the ground. The muskets were brought to shore but only one would fire. The spear was finally broken and all hastened to Port Jackson.

Manly had been envisaged as a seaside resort by Henry Gilbert Smith in the 1850s. In 1853, Smith acquired two large parcels of land (which had been granted to John Thompson in 1842 and John Crane Parker in 1837).

Initially John had chartered a paddle steamer to Manly and other vessels visited on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; &quot;excursion&quot; basis. Smith built a wharf on the harbour-side of Manly, which was completed in October 1855 and eventually acquired an interest in steamers himself - as part of developing more regular services to Manly to assist his sub-division property sales.

By 1873, Smith had sold the lease to the wharf and his share of the steamers to the operators of the ferries and eventually ownership passed to the once famous Port Jackson &amp; Manly Steamship Company. It was the Port Jackson &amp; Manly Steamship Company which coined the expression about Manly being &quot;Seven miles from Sydney and a thousand miles from care&quot; to promote its ferry service. The Port Jackson &amp; Manly Steamship Company played an important part in Manly&#x27;s development. It built several attractions including a large ocean pool and bathing pavilion, the Manly Fun Pier. In 1972 the company was sold to Brambles and in 1974 to the Government of New South Wales and it is now part of Sydney Ferries.

In March 1885, as the New South Wales Contingent was about to depart for the Sudan, a letter was addressed to Premier William Bede Dalley containing a cheque for £25 for the Patriotic Fund &quot;with my best wishes from a little boy at Manly&quot;. It was Australia&#x27;s first overseas military adventure, and the &quot;Little Boy from Manly&quot; became a symbol either of patriotism or, among opponents of the adventure, of mindless chauvinism. especially due to a cartoon by Livingston Hopkins of &quot;The Bulletin&quot;.

In 1896, the first film ever made in Australia was Marius Sestier&#x27;s &quot;Passengers Alighting from Ferry Brighton at Manly&quot;. The film, consisting of footage of the PS &quot;Brighton&quot; arriving at the wharf, premiered at the Salon Lumière on Pitt St (Australia&#x27;s first cinema) on 27 October 1896. No copy is known to have survived.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Manly was one of Australia&#x27;s most popular seaside holiday resorts. Manly Beach is said to be the place where the restriction on daylight sea bathing was first challenged in Australia. In October 1902 William Gocher, clad in a neck to knee costume, swam at midday after announcing his intention to do so in the newspaper he had established (&quot;Manly and North Sydney News&quot;). After being ignored by authorities and being publicly critical of them, he swam again and was escorted from the water by the police, although no charges were laid. In November 1903, Manly Council resolved to allow all-day bathing provided a neck to knee swimming costume was worn.
During the first official bathing season in 1903, 17 people drowned on Manly Beach. A year later a surf club was formed on the beach to safeguard the public. While there is debate about which club is the oldest, Manly Life Saving Club is one of the world&#x27;s first surf life saving clubs.

In 1934, George Robey, a resident and original Anzac founded the Air Mindedness Development League which was later renamed the &quot;Australian Air League&quot; at Manly. There has been a continuously running squadron in Manly since. In 1937 Manly Town Hall was opened.

In 1973, residents in the Eastern Hill section of Manly requested that the NSW Builders Labourers Federation place a green ban on the construction of two large tower blocks by LJ Hooker. The BLF agreed to do so and asked them to draw up a community plan for the area&#x27;s future.

== Heritage listings ==
Manly has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 151 Darley Road: St Patrick&#x27;s Seminary
* North Head Scenic Drive: North Head Quarantine Station
* Sydney Road: Ivanhoe Park cultural landscape
* West Esplanade: Manly Cove Pavilion
* West Esplanade: Manly ferry wharf
* 34a-36 Whistler Street: Manly Substation

==Climate==
Manly has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with warm summers and mild winters.

==Beaches==
Manly is most notable for its beaches, which are popular tourist destinations. Manly features a long stretch of sand on the ocean side, that runs from Queenscliff through North Steyne to South Steyne. This is followed by rock pools and sandy beaches called Fairy Bower and Shelly Beach. There are also a number of beaches on the harbour side of the peninsula being Collins Beach, Store Beach, Little Manly, East Manly Cove, West Manly Cove, Delwood Beach and Fairlight Beach. Norfolk Island pine trees are symbolic of Manly and are a prominent feature of both the ocean and harbour beaches.

On 10 March 2012, the stretch between Freshwater Beach and Shelly Beach was declared the &quot;Manly -Freshwater World Surfing Reserve&quot;. The Reserve was dedicated in a ceremony in Manly Beach by world surfing champion Kelly Slater accompanied by the Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir.

==Commercial area==

The commercial Manly is centred around The Corso, which runs from the harbour side at Manly wharf to the ocean side at Manly Beach. Part of The Corso is a mall which allows outdoor dining for cafes and restaurants. The commercial area extends to surrounding streets with more cafes and restaurants concentrated along the ocean and harbour shores.
Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (2013) was filmed in Sydney, primarily in Manly and Balmain. St Patrick&#x27;s Seminary was used as Jay Gatsby&#x27;s mansion–palm trees at the building&#x27;s exterior had to be digitally removed in post-production to create a realistic depiction of the Eastern United States (specifically Long Island), where the novel and film are set.

==Demographics==
According to the , there were 16,296 residents in Manly. 55.2% of residents were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 11.7%, New Zealand 3.2%, the United States of America 2.9%, Brazil 1.9% and South Africa 1.7%. 79.6% of residents spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Spanish 2.5%, French 2.0%, Portuguese 1.9%, German 1.5% and Italian 1.0%. The most common responses for religion in Manly were No Religion 51.1%, Catholic 20.6%, Anglican 11.6% and Christian, not further defined 1.5%.

==Transport==
Transport services to Manly include a ferry service from Manly wharf, and CDC NSW and Keolis Downer Northern Beaches bus services to the city and other suburbs. The Manly Ferry journey takes 30 minutes and allows for scenic views of Sydney Harbour, surrounding national parks and Sydney icons including the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. The ferry service once advertised Manly as &quot;seven miles from Sydney, and a thousand miles from care&quot;.

A privately owned and operated Manly Fast Ferry operates between Manly and Circular Quay, offering transport in a claimed trip time of 18 minutes, but this excludes unloading time. This replaced a similar but superior high speed operation that was run with a 15 minute (later 12 minute) trip hydrofoil service from 1964 until 1992 and then a 15 minute trip JetCat service which was used to replace the hydrofoils from 1990, but was withdrawn by the NSW Government in late December 2008.

==Housing==
The relaxed lifestyle, beaches and proximity to Sydney city have led to Manly&#x27;s real estate prices being amongst the highest in Australia. The adjoining suburb of Seaforth, which is now also part of Northern Beaches Council, has been ranked as the 25th richest suburb in Australia.

==Schools and churches==
The former Catholic seminary at St Patrick&#x27;s Estate, Darley Road, now houses The International College of Management, Sydney (ICMS) a management college, specializing in business, tourism, hospitality, events, property, sports and marketing retail management. It is affiliated with Macquarie University, which attracts international students from many countries. As well as being an educational hub, many spectacular weddings have been held here, including Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. The original seminary was designed by Hennessy and Sheerin and built in 1885. It was conceived by Archbishop Vaughan and is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.

On the other side of Darley Road is the Archbishop&#x27;s House, also known as the Cardinal&#x27;s Palace. This building was also designed by Sheerin and Hennessy and built in the 1880s. It was originally conceived as part of St Patrick&#x27;s Seminary and is a good example of the Victorian Gothic Revival style. It too is listed on the Register of the National Estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage of Australia, p.2/42&quot;&gt;Heritage of Australia, p. 2/42&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable landmark is the Presbyterian Church in Raglan Street. It was designed by John Sulman in the Romanesque style and built in 1892. It is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

<text>Anne Merrilyn Tolley (née Hicks; born 1 March 1953) is a New Zealand politician.

Tolley was elected as a member of the Napier City Council in 1986 and served as deputy mayor from 1989 until 1995. In 1999 she was elected to Parliament as a list MP representing the National Party. She was unseated in 2002 but returned in 2005 as the new East Coast MP. Between 2008 and 2017 she was a senior minister in the Fifth National Government, holding the offices of Minister of Education, Minister of Social Development, Minister of Corrections, Minister of Police and Minister of Local Government. She established Oranga Tamariki and was the first Minister for Children from 2016 to 2017.

She was Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives from 2017 to 2020. In 2021 she was appointed chair of the commission overseeing the Tauranga City Council.

==Early life and family==
Tolley was born in Wellington on 1 March 1953, the daughter of Mary Margaret Hicks (née Norris) and her husband Ronald James Hicks. She was educated at Colenso High School (now William Colenso College) in Napier, and spent time as a Rotary exchange student in Allentown, Pennsylvania, United States. She went on to gain a diploma in computer programming. In 1973 she married Allan Hunt Tolley, and the couple had three children. With her husband, Tolley ran a boutique hotel in Napier.

==Local government==
In 1986 Tolley was elected as a member of the Napier City Council and remained in that role until 1995. She served as deputy mayor of Napier between 1989 and 1995, and was an elected member of the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regional Council from 1989 to 1992. She has been a Justice of the Peace since 1989.

While on Napier City Council, Tolley was involved in the establishment of a local-authority trading enterprise to run Marineland and the Napier Aquarium, the Emerson Street redevelopment project, and the redevelopment of McLean Park. She sought re-election in the 1995 local elections, but was defeated.

==Member of Parliament==



An independent on the Napier City Council, Tolley was encouraged to join the Labour Party by incumbent Napier MP Geoff Braybrooke but declined, instead joining the National Party. She was interested in being a candidate for National at the 1996 general election, but had not been a member of the party for long enough. She challenged Braybrooke for the Napier seat in 1999. While unsuccessful in that contest, Tolley was elected as a list MP. 

In her first term, Tolley sat on the governance and administration committee and served as the National Party spokesperson for early childhood education and women&#x27;s affairs. In 2000, her members bill—the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification (Prohibition of Child Pornography) Amendment Bill—was introduced. The bill responded to, and sought to overturn, the Court of Appeal&#x27;s decision on &quot;Moonen v Film and Literature Board of Review&quot;, which had found that the right to freedom of expression in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 held even in the Film and Literature Board of Review&#x27;s consideration of photographs depicting children in sexualised poses. The bill was eventually voted down because the government did not consider &quot;Moonen&quot; to sanction child pornography. Issues around censorship were progressed soon after through an inquiry into the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 and a government amendment passed in 2005.

In the 2002 election, she unsuccessfully contested the Napier seat against Braybrooke&#x27;s successor, Russell Fairbrother. Along with many other National MPs, Tolley did not escape the collapse of the party&#x27;s vote that year, and so did not return to Parliament as a list MP. She did return at the 2005 general election, having won the East Coast electorate over Labour candidate Moana Mackey, daughter of the previous East Coast MP Janet Mackey. She held the electorate at the four subsequent elections.

She served as the first woman National Party whip from December 2006 until February 2008 when she became the party&#x27;s education spokesperson. When National won the 2008 general election, she became the first woman Minister of Education. She continued in senior roles in the Fifth National Government until its defeat in 2017 and thereafter became Deputy Speaker. In that role, she chaired a cross-party steering group steering group to develop a parliamentary code of conduct, as an outcome of an independent review into bullying and harassment in the parliamentary workplace.

At the end of 2019, Tolley declared her intention to run as a list-only candidate in the 2020 general election in hope of being able to be appointed Speaker of the House if National were able to form a government. She was succeeded as National&#x27;s candidate for the East Coast electorate by Rotorua District Councillor Tania Tapsell. However, in June 2020, with National polling poorly, Tolley announced that she would instead retire at the 2020 election. She gave her valedictory statement on 23 July 2020.

== Minister in the Fifth National Government ==

===Minister of Education: 2008–2011===
The National Party formed a government after the 2008 general election and Tolley was appointed Minister of Education, the first woman to hold that position. The key policy introduced during her term was introduction of the National Standards programme that measured children&#x27;s progress against the curriculum in reading, writing and mathematics, in order to increase schools&#x27; accountability. The programme was opposed by many teachers and school principals, some of whom refused to implement the standards. In January 2010, Tolley&#x27;s responsibilities for tertiary education were reassigned to Steven Joyce, with Prime Minister John Key stating that this would allow Tolley to focus on the implementation of national standards.

In June 2010, Tolley expressed concerns about a Parliamentary Library research paper that was critical of National Standards, calling it &quot;unprofessional&quot;, &quot;highly political&quot; and so biased it could have been written by the union opposing the policy. Such papers are required by the Parliamentary Library to be politically neutral. A month later the New Zealand Principals Federation voted to support regional associations which boycotted training for National Standards. Tolley reminded principals that in her view it would be quicker and give better results to contact herself or the Ministry of Education with concerns about the changes, than to speak through the media.

The stand-off between Tolley and teachers was embarrassing for the Government and resulted in Cabinet changes after National was re-elected in November 2011. Hekia Parata was made Education Minister while Tolley was demoted in the Cabinet rankings, becoming Minister of Corrections and Police, succeeding Judith Collins who was promoted to Minister of Justice.

===Minister of Police and Minister of Corrections: 2011–2014===
In March 2012, one of her first major announcements as the Minister of Corrections was the proposed closure of the old prisons in Wellington and New Plymouth. She also said that a number of older units at Arohata, Rolleston, Rangipo and Waikeria prisons would close. Later that year, the Government awarded a 25-year contract to Serco to build a 960-bed prison at Wiri, South Auckland, at a cost of NZ$900 million. Tolley attended a sod-turning ceremony at the site of the new prison Wiri in September 2012.

In June 2012, Tolley as Police Minister was responsible for crushing the first &quot;boy racer&quot; car under the Vehicle Confiscation and Seizure Act.

=== Minister of Social Development and Minister for Children: 2014–2017 ===
When National was returned to government after the 2014 general election, Tolley succeeded Paula Bennett as Minister of Social Development. A key achievement during this term was reforming the Child, Youth and Family service within the Ministry of Social Development into a standalone agency, Oranga Tamariki, the Ministry for Children, after a Children&#x27;s Commissioner report in 2015 found that the government had failed children in state care.

From September to December 2016, Tolley had an additional appointment as Minister for Youth. On 20 December 2016 she became the Minister for Children and the Minister of Local Government and held these roles, along with Minister of Social Development, until the Government was defeated at the 2017 general election.

Along with former state services minister Paula Bennett, Tolley was accused by New Zealand First party leader Winston Peters in 2017 of leaking information about his incorrectly filed superannuation application. Tolley admitted having told her sister of the situation before it was reported by media, but was not found to have alerted media.

==Tauranga City Council==
On 9 February 2021, the Minister of Local Government appointed a Crown Commission to oversee all of Tauranga City Council&#x27;s governance responsibilities (with all existing elected members being discharged). Tolley was appointed commission chair. 

==Health==
It emerged in 2010 that Tolley had undergone gastric bypass (stomach stapling) surgery in order to lose weight. Tolley joins other current and former New Zealand politicians including Rahui Katene, David Lange, Chester Borrows, Donna Awatere-Huata and Tariana Turia to have had gastric bypass surgery at some point in the past.

<doc id="1097923" wikidata="Q2224404" url="?curid=1097923" title="Sarah Kernochan">
<text>Sarah Marshall Kernochan ( ; born December 30, 1947) is an American documentarian, film director, screenwriter and novelist. She is the recipient of several prestigious awards, including two Academy Awards (Documentary Feature for &quot;Marjoe&quot; in 1973 and Documentary Short Subject for &quot;Thoth&quot; in 2002).

==Early life ==
Kernochan was born in New York City, the daughter of Adelaide (Chatfield-Taylor), a UNESCO consultant, and John Marshall Kernochan, a Columbia Law School professor. Her maternal grandfather was Wayne Chatfield-Taylor, Under Secretary of Commerce and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Her maternal great-grandparents included writers Hobart Chatfield-Taylor and Anna De Koven. Her great-great-grandfather was Illinois Senator and XIT Ranch owner Charles B. Farwell. Her paternal grandfather was composer Marshall Kernochan.

She graduated from Rosemary Hall (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in 1965, where Kernochan was classmates with Glenn Close, and attended Sarah Lawrence College in 1966.

==Career==
After Sarah Lawrence, she worked as a ghostwriter for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; for about a year. After quitting that job, she became interested in documentary film-making and soon gained national prominence in the United States as co-director and co-producer with Howard Smith of the film &quot;Marjoe&quot; (1972), about evangelist Marjoe Gortner, which won an Academy Award for Documentary Feature.

Kernochan&#x27;s first screen credit as a screenwriter came with the film &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1986). She followed that film with the script for &quot;Dancers&quot; (1987), starring Mikhail Baryshnikov and directed by Herbert Ross, which chronicled the backstage drama of a ballet company (played by American Ballet Theatre dancers) and their director during the staging of the ballet &quot;Giselle&quot;.

By the time she was brought in to work on the film &quot;Sommersby&quot; (1993), she had become known for a particular style of writing in Hollywood. She commented in an interview with &quot;Salon:
:I think people know that there&#x27;s no point in calling me in if you want the other kind of women characters: a featureless &quot;help me&quot; character, or the saint, the whore — you know, any of the archetypes. I don&#x27;t think all women are powerful, intelligent, any of those things. I just require that female characters be very real, that they have all the dimensions that the male characters do.

Since then, she has been primarily a screenwriter for such films as &quot;Dancers&quot; (1987); &quot;Impromptu&quot; (1991), the debut film directed by her husband James Lapine with a script she characterized as &quot;maybe the best thing that I will ever do&quot;; &quot;Sommersby&quot; (1993); wrote and directed &quot;The Hairy Bird&quot; (1998); co-wrote 
the story for &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; (2000); and directed &quot;Thoth&quot; (2002) and wrote &quot;Learning to Drive&quot; (2014).

Her second documentary, &quot;Thoth&quot;, also won an Academy Award in 2002, this time for Best Documentary Short Subject. She has taught screenwriting at Emerson College.

In August 2014, her feature script &quot;Learning to Drive&quot;, based on a &quot;New Yorker&quot; story by Katha Pollitt, went before cameras. Starring Ben Kingsley and Patricia Clarkson, the film was released in the United States on August 21, 2015.

===Novels===
In 1977, Kernochan&#x27;s novel &quot;Dry Hustle&quot; ( in hard cover, in paperback) was published. It was reprinted as an ebook in 2011. In June 2011, Kernochan released her first novel in over 35 years entitled &quot;Jane Was Here&quot; (). A mysterious young woman, calling herself Jane, arrives in the small rundown community of Graynier, Massachusetts. She can point out the house where she grew up, though she has never been to Graynier in her life. Jane carries with her the fragmentary memory of her former life, and refuses to adjust to her new identity. Thus begins Jane&#x27;s mission, to retrieve the puzzle pieces of a former life, groping her way through the past and the present simultaneously.

===Music career===
Kernochan is also a singer, lyricist and composer. During the two years after the release of &quot;Marjoe&quot;, she released two albums on RCA Records as a singer-songwriter, &quot;House of Pain&quot; and &quot;Beat Around the Bush&quot;.

Kernochan released her third album as a singer-songwriter, &quot;Decades of Demos&quot;, in 2013. She also wrote the musical &quot;Sleeparound Town&quot;, which was a show about puberty and featured five adolescents.

==Personal life==
Kernochan is married to American stage director James Lapine, a Pulitzer Prize and three-time Tony Award winner. The couple&#x27;s daughter is food and health writer Phoebe Lapine.

<doc id="1097925" wikidata="Q5163158" url="?curid=1097925" title="Conserved current">
<text>In physics a conserved current is a current, formula_1, that satisfies the continuity equation formula_2. The continuity equation represents a conservation law, hence the name.

Indeed, integrating the continuity equation over a volume formula_3, large enough to have no net currents through its surface, leads to the conservation lawformula_4where formula_5 is the conserved quantity.

In gauge theories the gauge fields couple to conserved currents. For example, the electromagnetic field couples to the conserved electric current.

==Conserved quantities and symmetries==
Conserved current is the flow of the canonical conjugate of a quantity possessing a continuous translational symmetry. The continuity equation for the conserved current is a statement of a &quot;conservation law&quot;. Examples of canonical conjugate quantities are:
*Time and energy - the continuous translational symmetry of time implies the conservation of energy
*Space and momentum - the continuous translational symmetry of space implies the conservation of momentum
*Space and angular momentum - the continuous &quot;rotational&quot; symmetry of space implies the conservation of angular momentum
*Wave function phase and electric charge - the continuous phase angle symmetry of the wave function implies the conservation of electric charge

Conserved currents play an extremely important role in theoretical physics, because Noether&#x27;s theorem connects the existence of a conserved current to the existence of a symmetry of some quantity in the system under study. In practical terms, all conserved currents are the Noether currents, as the existence of a conserved current implies the existence of a symmetry. Conserved currents play an important role in the theory of partial differential equations, as the existence of a conserved current points to the existence of constants of motion, which are required to define a foliation and thus an integrable system. The conservation law is expressed as the vanishing of a 4-divergence, where the Noether charge forms the zeroth component of the 4-current.

==Examples==
===Electromagnetism===
The &quot;conservation of charge&quot;, for example, in the notation of Maxwell&#x27;s equations,formula_6

where
* ρ is the &quot;free&quot; electric charge density (in units of C/m3)
* J is the current density formula_7 with v as the velocity of the charges.

The equation would apply equally to masses (or other conserved quantities), where the word &quot;mass&quot; is substituted for the words &quot;electric charge&quot; above.

===Complex scalar field===
The Lagrangian density
formula_8
of a complex scalar field formula_9 is invariant under the symmetry transformationformula_10 
Defining formula_11 we find the Noether current
formula_12which satisfies the continuity equation.

<text>Heng Samrin (; born 25 May 1934) is a Cambodian politician who served as the President of the National Assembly of Cambodia (2006–2023). Between 1979 and 1992, he was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Hanoi-backed People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea (1979–1989) and State of Cambodia (1989–1992) and General Secretary of the Kampuchean People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (1981–1991). He has been a member of Parliament since 14 June 1993. He is the oldest member of parliament, and the longest-serving president of the National Assembly in history. His honorary title is &quot;Samdech Akka Moha Ponhea Chakrei Heng Samrin&quot; ().

==Life and career==
Heng Samrin was born in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia, in 1934. He joined the Khmer Rouge communist movement led by Pol Pot, and became a political commissar and army division commander when the Khmer Rouge, backed by China, took over the government in 1975. In 1978, after a series of violent purges within the Khmer Rouge leadership in which many prominent cadre members whom Pol Pot felt might be rivals were executed, he fled to Vietnam. 

In Vietnam, he was one of the founding members of the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation (FUNSK). Later that year, Heng returned to Cambodia and organized a resistance movement with the backing and support of Vietnam and the Soviet Union.

After a Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia overthrew the regime of Khmer Rouge in 1979, Vietnamese occupation authorities established the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea, installing Heng and other pro-Vietnamese Communist politicians as leaders of the new government. He became chairman of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Council of the PRK in 1979. In 1981, he became chairman of the Council of State and secretary-general of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party. Though at first he was the effective leader of the government, he lost much of his political power when Hun Sen became Prime Minister of Cambodia in 1985.

As Vietnamese influence declined, Samrin gradually lost his posts, including the post of secretary-general in 1991 and chairman of the council of state in 1992. When King Norodom Sihanouk was restored in 1993, Samrin was given the honorary title of Sâmdech, senior advisor of the King, and was made honorary chairman of Hun Sen&#x27;s Cambodian People&#x27;s Party. He was vice chairman of the National Assembly of Cambodia (1998–2006). Since 2006, he has acted as Chairman of the Solidarity Front for Development of the Cambodian Motherland.

The Cambodian People&#x27;s Party recently released a book about Samrin called &quot;A Man of the People&quot;, dedicated to him as a hero. According to that book, among supporters of the ruling CPP Heng Samrin is a &quot;much loved and respected figure&quot;, even though his recent duties are often largely ceremonial. His full title is &quot;Samdach Akeak Moha Ponhea Chakrei Heng Samrin, Protean Radhsaphea ney Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea&quot; (Khmer: សម្តេចអគ្គមហាពញាចក្រី ហេង សំរិន ប្រធានរដ្ឋសភា នៃព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា).

<text>The Kaliningrad K-8 (R-8) (NATO reporting name AA-3 &#x27;[[Anab]]&#x27;) was a medium-range air-to-air missile developed by the Soviet Union for interceptor aircraft use.

The K-8 was developed by OKB-339/NII-339 (currently Phazotron NIIR). The infrared seeker was developed by TsKB-589 GKOT (currently TsKB Geofizika), who also developed the seeker for 9M31 missile of 9K31 Strela-1.

==History==
The K-8&#x27;s development began in 1955, known as R-8 in service. Like most Soviet air-to-air missiles, it was made with a choice of semi-active radar homing or infrared seeker heads. The original missile was compatible with the Uragan-5B radar used on the Sukhoi Su-11 and several developmental aircraft from Mikoyan-Gurevich.

It was upgraded to R-8M (better known as R-98) standard in 1961, giving the SARH weapon the capability for head-on intercepts. In 1963 it was further upgraded to the R-8M1, making it compatible with the RP-11 Oryol-D radar of the Sukhoi Su-15 and Yakovlev Yak-28P.

Subsequent development led in 1965 to R-8M2, more commonly called R-98, with longer range and improved seekers, compatible with the upgraded RP-11 Oryol-M (&quot;Eagle&quot;) radar. The final variant, introduced from 1973, was the R-98M1 (NATO &#x27;Advanced Anab&#x27;) with better countermeasures resistance and longer range, matched to the Taifun-M radar of the Su-15TM and Yak-28PM interceptors.

The R-98M1 remained in service through the 1980s, being withdrawn with the last Su-15 &#x27;Flagon&#x27; interceptors.

A variant using the seeker heads of the K-13, giving better dogfight capability, was developed in 1960 as the K-88, but it did not enter service.

An inert training version was also developed, designated UR-8M.

The R-98 brought down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 on September 1, 1983.

<text>Kathleen M. O&#x27;Toole ( Horton; born May 9, 1954) is an American law enforcement officer who served as Chief of the Seattle Police Department (SPD) from June 23, 2014, to January 4, 2018. She was previously the first female commissioner of the Boston Police Department, when appointed by Mayor of Boston Thomas M. Menino in February 2004.

On May 9, 2006, her 52nd birthday, O&#x27;Toole officially announced that she was leaving the Boston Police Department to move to Ireland. She was the first Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, established to ensure that Garda Síochána operates effectively and efficiently. The Inspectorate reports directly to Ireland&#x27;s Minister for Justice and Equality. She then returned to the U.S. and took her position in Seattle. O&#x27;Toole also sits on the bipartisan advisory board of States United Democracy Center.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Toole was born in 1954 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and moved to Marblehead at age 13 and to Boston, Massachusetts, at age 18. She resided in Boston from that time until she took a position in Ireland in 2006. O&#x27;Toole earned a Bachelor of Arts from Boston College in 1976, a Juris Doctor from New England School of Law in 1982, and a PhD from the Business School of Trinity College Dublin in 2018.

==Career==
O’Toole began her career in 1979 as a Boston police officer. In 1986, she joined the Metropolitan District Commission Police, at the time led by William Bratton. In 1990, she succeeded Bratton as head, but she left this position in 1991 in order to become a security executive for the Digital Equipment Corporation. O&#x27;Toole then served as Lieutenant Colonel of Massachusetts State Police from 1992 to 1994. While maintaining her sworn State Police rank, she served from 1994 to 1998 as Massachusetts Secretary of Public Safety in the cabinet of Governor William Weld. She was then appointed to the Patten Commission headed by Lord Patten of Barnes which reformed policing in Northern Ireland and led to the formation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. In May 2014, she was nominated by Mayor Ed Murray to become Seattle&#x27;s first female chief of police.

=== Shooting of Victoria Snelgrove ===
While serving as Commissioner of the Boston Police, O&#x27;Toole was a central figure in the controversy surrounding the fatal shooting of Victoria Snelgrove during celebrations following the Boston Red Sox victory over the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium in Game 7 the 2004 American League Championship Series. During attempts to control the crowd that had gathered near Fenway Park, Boston police fired a &quot;less lethal&quot; FN 303 round, which missed its intended target and struck Snelgrove in the eye, resulting in her death approximately 12 hours later.

While Commissioner O&#x27;Toole demoted Superintendent James Claiborne, who was not in the vicinity of the shooting, and suspended two officers involved in the incident, no prosecution or dismissal was brought against any officer in the case. Investigations led by former U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern and Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley concluded that criminal charges would not be appropriate.

===Garda Inspectorate===
The three-member Garda Inspectorate examines operational, investigative, managerial and policing strategies to ensure that these meet best practice. O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s role within the Garda was to clean up the then-current scandalous conditions in the Gardaí. The Morris Tribunal pronounced that it was &quot;staggered&quot; by the level of indiscipline and insubordination in the force and the Irish Government responded with a revised code of discipline. O&#x27;Toole served her full term of office and was asked to stay on until the new Chief Inspector could take up his position in July 2012.

===Later career===
In late-2024, O&#x27;Toole and then-interim Seattle police chief Sue Rahr jointly led the search committee to make a recommendation to Mayor Bruce Harrell on who Seattle&#x27;s next police chief should be. Their top recommendation was Madison, Wisconsin Police Chief Shon Barnes. Harrell heeded this recommendation and selected Barnes as his nominee for police chief.

==Personal life==
She is married to Daniel O&#x27;Toole, now a retired Boston police detective. They have one daughter, Meghan, who received her undergraduate degree from Boston College and her master&#x27;s degree from National University of Ireland, Galway.

<text>Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus ( 2 BC – January AD 41) was a member of the imperial Julio-Claudian dynasty of Ancient Rome. Domitius was the son of Antonia Major (daughter of emperor Augustus&#x27; sister Octavia Minor and her second husband Mark Antony). He married Agrippina the Younger and became the father of the emperor Nero.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Domitius&#x27; birthdate is uncertain; some interpretations are that he was born around 17 BC while other sources argue he was born a generation later in 2 BC. Domitius was the son of Antonia Major, the niece of emperor Augustus, and her husband Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. He had at least two sisters Domitia and Domitia Lepida, and possibly an older brother named Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, whom ancient sources confuse his early career and birthdate with.

===Career===
Describing him as &quot;a man loathsome in every respect&quot;, Suetonius says that as a young man, Domitius was serving on the staff of his second cousin Gaius Caesar in the east, in AD 2. Domitius killed his freedman for refusing to drink as much as he was told. The reported reason was that the freedman did not get as drunk as Domitius did. On the Appian Way, Domitius was reported to have deliberately run over a child who was playing with his doll. At the Roman Forum, Domitius reportedly pulled out an eye of an equestrian because the equestrian openly criticized him. Although some historians such as Ronald Syme have argued that the Domitius who served with Gaius Caesar may have been an older brother of his and not Nero&#x27;s father. Gaius Stern claims that the Eastern expedition is actually that of Germanicus in AD 17–19, if one assumes his birth to be in 2 BC and still interpret the violent actions to belong to Nero&#x27;s father.

Domitius cheated on bankers for purchases he made. When he was praetor, Domitius would swindle the prize money of victorious charioteers. Managers would complain, but Domitius decreed that future prizes would be paid on the spot. Domitius was also considered a serious womanizer. The emperor Tiberius charged him with treason, adultery and incest with his sister and also with adultery with another noblewoman, but the ascension of Caligula saved him.

Domitius married his first cousin once removed Agrippina the Younger, Caligula&#x27;s sister, after her thirteenth birthday in AD 28. He was far older than her at the time. Tiberius arranged and ordered the marriage, which was celebrated in Rome. Domitius was wealthy, but apparently he and Agrippina chose to live between Antium and Rome.
Domitius was consul in AD 32 and appointed by Tiberius as a commissioner in early AD 37. His son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, later emperor Nero, was born on 15 December AD 37 in Antium. According to Suetonius, when Domitius was congratulated by his friends for the birth of his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger, a fact that became true during the second part of Nero&#x27;s reign. When Nero castrated a boy named Sporus and married him as a wife, Suetonius quoted one Roman who lived around this time who remarked that the world would have been better off if Nero&#x27;s father had married someone more like the castrated boy.

He died of edema at Pyrgi (an ancient Etruscan city) in January AD 41. In Domitius&#x27; will, Nero inherited one third of his estate, but Caligula, who was also mentioned in the will, took Nero&#x27;s inheritance for himself. When Claudius became emperor, Nero&#x27;s inheritance was restored.

==Legacy==

During his lifetime, Domitius did not enjoy a good reputation. He was accused of being the accomplice of Albucilla in the crimes of adultery and murder, and also of incest with his sister Domitia Lepida, and narrowly escaped execution only because of the death of Tiberius.

His widow Agrippina later married her widowed uncle Claudius. Her son Lucius was adopted by the elderly Claudius and renamed Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus. When Claudius died on 13 October AD 54, Nero succeeded him as Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus. Nero exalted Domitius&#x27; memory, and the Roman Senate arranged for the construction of his statue in AD 55.

<doc id="1097945" wikidata="Q2273174" url="?curid=1097945" title="USS Colorado (1856)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Colorado&quot;, a , three-masted steam screw frigate, was launched on 19 June 1856, by the Norfolk Navy Yard. Named after the Colorado River, she was sponsored by Ms. N. S. Dornin, and commissioned on 13 March 1858, with Captain W. H. Gardner, in command. She was the fifth of the &quot;Franklin&quot;-class frigates, which were all named after US rivers, except for .

== Pre-Civil War ==
Putting to sea from Boston on 12 May 1858, &quot;Colorado&quot; cruised in Cuban waters deterring the practice of search by British cruisers until 6 August, when she returned to Boston and was placed in ordinary until 1861.

=== Civil War ===
&quot;Colorado&quot; was recommissioned on 3 June 1861, and sailed from Boston on 18 June, to join the Union Navy&#x27;s Gulf Blockading Squadron. She was under the task force commander, Commodore William Marvine, acting as his flagship for the Blockade. On 14 September, an expedition under Lieutenant J. H. Russell, from &quot;Colorado&quot;, cut out the schooner &quot;Judah&quot;, believed to be preparing for service as a privateer and spiked one gun of a battery at the Pensacola Navy Yard, losing three men in the raid. On 11 December, another expedition was sent to Pilot Town, and succeeded in capturing a small schooner and two men. &quot;Colorado&quot; assisted in the capture of the steamer &quot;Calhoun&quot; (or &quot;Cuba&quot;) on 23 January 1862, off South West Pass, at the mouth of the Mississippi River, and a week later engaged four Confederate steamers.

In April 1862, &quot;Colorado&quot;, built for fighting at sea, was prevented from participating in the Battle of New Orleans because her draft was too deep to cross the bar. Nineteen guns and one howitzer were removed and distributed across the fleet. She returned to Boston, on 21 June, and was decommissioned from 28 June-10 November.

&quot;Colorado&quot; sailed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 9 December, to rejoin the blockading force off Mobile, Alabama, on 13 March 1863. She shared in the capture of the schooner &quot;Hunter&quot; on 17 May. Returning to Portsmouth Navy Yard, on 4 February 1864, she was again placed out of commission from 18 February-1 September.

Clearing Portsmouth, on 6 October, she joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and cruised off the coast of North Carolina, until 26 January 1865. &quot;Colorado&quot; participated in the bombardment and capture of Fort Fisher from 13 to 15 January. She was struck six times by enemy fire which killed one man and wounded two.

By late 1864, Wilmington, North Carolina, was the only port left to the Confederacy. Its access to the sea was protected by Fort Fisher, at the mouth of the Cape Fear River.

A joint Army-Navy attack in December failed (the First Battle of Fort Fisher, 7–27 December 1864).[4]

A second attack came in January (the Second Battle of Fort Fisher, 13–15 January 1865). &quot;Colorado&quot; was engaged, and George Dewey played a key role in her success.

&quot;Colorado&quot;, being a wooden ship, was placed in the line outside the monitors and other armored vessels, but got a full share of conflict. Toward the end of the second engagement Admiral Porter signaled Commodore Thatcher to close in and silence a certain part of the works. As &quot;Colorado&quot; had already received considerable damage, her officers remonstrated. But Dewey, who had now acquired marked tactical ability, was quick to see the advantage to be gained by the move and the work was taken in fifteen minutes. The New York Times, commenting upon this part of the action, spoke of it as &quot;the most beautiful duel of the war&quot;. When Admiral Porter came to congratulate Commodore Thatcher the latter said generously: &quot;You must thank Lieutenant Dewey, sir. It was his move.&quot; Nevertheless, Thatcher was promoted to rear admiral. He tried to take Dewey with him as his fleet captain when he went to supersede Farragut at Mobile Bay. This was not permitted, but Dewey was promoted to lieutenant-commander.[4]

=== Prizes ===
== Post-Civil War ==
=== European Squadron ===
From 3 February – 25 May 1865, &quot;Colorado&quot; was again out of commission at New York Navy Yard. Ordered to the European Squadron as flagship, she sailed on 11 June, and cruised off England, Portugal, and Spain, and in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas until she departed Cherbourg, on 23 July 1867, for New York, where she was placed in ordinary from 7 September 1867 – 15 February 1870. During this period LCDR Dewey&#x27;s next tour of duty was in 1867 and 1868, as executive officer on board &quot;Colorado&quot;.

=== Asiatic Squadron ===
&quot;Colorado&quot; was flagship of the Asiatic Squadron. America had emerged from the Civil War and its foreign policy at the time was to rival the European powers (France, Russia and Britain) in their efforts to establish trade and spheres of influence in China, Japan, and Korea.

&quot;Colorado&quot; cruised on the Asiatic Station from 9 April 1870 – 15 March 1873. As flagship for Rear Admiral John Rodgers&#x27; squadron, she carried the U.S. Minister (to China and Korea) on a diplomatic mission in April 1871.

On 1 June 1871, an unprovoked attack was made on two ships of the squadron by shore batteries from two Korean forts on the Salee River. When no explanation was offered, a punitive expedition known as the &quot;Sinmiyangyo&quot; was mounted that destroyed the forts and inflicted heavy casualties on the Koreans.

Clearing Hong Kong, on 21 November 1872, &quot;Colorado&quot; sailed, by way of Singapore and Cape Town, for New York, arriving on 11 March 1873.

=== North Atlantic Squadron ===
&quot;Colorado&quot; sailed from New York, on 12 December, to cruise the North Atlantic Station, and became flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron on 27 August 1874.

== Decommissioned ==
Returning to New York, on 30 May 1876, &quot;Colorado&quot; was placed out of commission on 8 June. From 1876 to 1884, she was used as a receiving ship at New York Navy Yard. She was sold on 14 February 1885, to a private company; and broken up for salvage material and burned for her copper fastenings.

While the ship was being broken up off of Plum Beach, near Port Washington, Long Island, a fire broke out on the forward decks, which was where boards were being burnt for iron spikes. The fire spread to several other nearby, former navy ships, which were also due to be broken up for salvage, these were , , , &quot;Iowa&quot;, and . Along with &quot;Colorado&quot;, these other ships went down after they were burnt. The company that had been breaking the ships up, Stannard &amp; Co., claimed at the time that the fire may have caused a loss of more than $100,000.

<doc id="1097951" wikidata="Q325290" url="?curid=1097951" title="Arnold Henry Savage Landor">
<text>Arnold Henry Savage Landor (2 June 1865 – 26 December 1924) was an English painter, explorer, writer, and anthropologist. 

==Life and career==
Arnold H. S. Landor was born to Charles Savage Landor in Florence, Italy, where he spent his childhood. The writer Walter Savage Landor was his grandfather.

He left for Paris at age fifteen to study at the Académie Julian directed by Gustave Boulanger and Jules Lefebvre. He then traveled the world, including America, Japan, and Korea, painting many landscapes and portraits. His 1895 travel memoirs from Korea included accounts of appointments to portray two Princes of the ruling Min clan, each of whom received him more graciously than they had the British consul. The gifts from one of his sitters included a white leopard skin and a set of screens that were of especial rarity. Upon his return to England, he was invited to Balmoral by Queen Victoria to recount his adventures and show his drawings. He later traveled to Nepal and Tibet, telling of his experiences in two books: &quot;In the Forbidden Land&quot; (1898) and &quot;Tibet and Nepal&quot; (1905).

When he learned about the Boxer Rebellion in China he went to Peking (now spelled Beijing) to join the victory parade, afterward writing &quot;China and the Allies&quot; (1901). In 1901 he traveled from Russia to India, riding on horseback through Persia, publishing the account of that journey in the book &quot;Across Coveted Lands&quot; (1902). A journey to the Philippine Islands resulted in another book: &quot;The Gems of the East&quot; (1904).

During the 1900s he visited Abyssinia and painted a portrait of the king Menelik II. Landor&#x27;s book &quot;Across Widest Africa&quot; was published in 1906.

===Current composition and election method===

Willoughby City Council is composed of thirteen councillors, including the mayor, for a fixed four-year term of office. The Mayor is directly elected while the twelve other councillors are elected proportionally as four separate wards, each electing three councillors. The most recent Council election was held on 21 December 2021.

The current Council is:

==History==

===Aboriginal culture===
As of January 2022, Willoughby Council has announced that Talus Street Reserve, on Gammeraygal land in the suburb of Naremburn would be handed back to the Local Aboriginal Land Council (LALC). The precinct includes a creek, bushland, walking tracks, picnic tables and parking areas. Nathan Moran, CEO of the Metropolitan LALC told NITV News that the hand back represents the realisation of Aboriginal Land Rights. &quot;Returning crown land is recompense for loss of all freehold, leasehold and or state-owned and used land as well for not getting royalties for mining,&quot; he said.

Willoughby Mayor, Tanya Taylor, described the reserve as &quot;beautiful land&quot; and emphasised the council&#x27;s resounding support for the decision. &quot;Council acknowledges the rich Indigenous history of the Gammeraygal people in the area. The transfer will embed this significant indigenous heritage, drive cultural and social outcomes as it affirms Aboriginal Land Rights and supports reconciliation&quot;, Mayor Taylor said.

===European settlement===
In May 1865, 67 residents of the rural District of Willoughby sent a petition to the Governor Sir John Young, requesting the incorporation of the Municipality of North Willoughby. This resulted in the Municipality of North Willoughby being formally proclaimed on 23 October 1865. The council first met to elect six Councillors and two Auditors on 16 December 1865, in the house of James Harris French and the first chairman, James William Bligh, was elected on 1 January 1866.

There were no wards until 1876 when the council was divided into three wards: Chatsworth Ward to the north, Middle Harbour Ward to the east and Lane Cove Ward to the west. Lane Cove Ward became the separate Municipality of Lane Cove on 11 February 1895 and Middle Harbour Ward was divided into Middle Harbour and Naremburn wards. With the passing of the Municipalities Act, 1867, the name was changed to be the Borough of North Willoughby, which then changed to Borough of Willoughby in the &quot;Borough of Willoughby Naming Act 1890&quot;. In June 1900, a petition to expand the number of wards from three to four, each electing three aldermen, was proclaimed dividing Chatsworth Ward into Chatswood East and West wards in addition to Middle Harbour and Naremburn wards. From 28 December 1906, with the passing of the &quot;Local Government Act, 1906&quot;, the council area was renamed the Municipality of Willoughby. In August 1941, the Minister for Local Government, James McGirr, approved a proposal to split Middle Harbour Ward, adding Northbridge Ward as the fifth ward electing three aldermen.

The first council meetings were held in a hut located behind the main residence of major landholder and timer merchant, James Harris French, on the corner of Penshurst and Penkivil Streets. Municipal offices were afterwards established in Penshurst Street near Forsyth Street corner. These were in turn followed by the Council Chambers in the old School of Arts building in Mowbray Road from 1877, which then became part of the Mowbray House School. These chambers were replaced in 1903 by the first Town Hall building in Victoria Avenue, designed by Byera Hadley and officially opened by the Premier, Sir John See, on 2 September 1903. The first town hall was demolished in 1969 and replaced by the second Willoughby Town Hall with the adjacent Council Administration Centre as the &quot;Willoughby Civic Centre&quot;. The council was granted city status and was proclaimed as the City of Willoughby on 17 November 1989.

A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the City of Willoughby merge with adjoining councils. The government considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger of the North Sydney and Willoughby Councils to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 145,000. The alternative, proposed by Warringah Council on 23 February 2016, was for an amalgamation of the Pittwater, Manly and Warringah councils. As a consequence of Warringah&#x27;s proposal, the New South Wales Minister for Local Government Paul Toole proposed that the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman Councils merge. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the North Sydney, Willoughby and Mosman local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers.

===Council seal===
The Council seal first appeared in records on 7 May 1867, containing only the words &quot;Municipality of North Willoughby Common Seal&quot;. In 1890 the floral emblem was used in the middle of the seal for the first time with &quot;Borough of Willoughby&quot;. Willoughby became a City on 17 November 1989 and the city crest was altered accordingly, with the wording &quot;The Council of the City of Willoughby&quot; replacing the previous title and a mural crown added to symbolise city status. It was this latest seal that was incorporated into the Willoughby City Flag, designed by John Vaughan and first flown on 12 May 1990.

The present council seal, formally adopted in August 1990, contains an emblem of various native flowers:
*Waratah – &quot;Telopea speciosissima&quot;
*Christmas Bell – &quot;Blandfordia grandiflora&quot;
*Sydney Red Gum – &quot;Angophora costata&quot;
*Flannel Flower – &quot;Actinotus helianthi &quot;
*Native Rose – &quot;Boronia serrulata&quot;

Two of the main pioneering industries of the area are also symbolised in the seal: the tanning industry represented by the leather belt and the brick-making industry represented in the mural crown. In July 1999, council adopted a corporate logo, taking the form of a stylised Waratah, with the phrase &quot;City of Diversity&quot;.

<text>Alexandros Giotopoulos (; born 1944) is a Greek convicted terrorist, currently serving seventeen life sentences plus 25 years imprisonment. He was found guilty in 2003 of leading the Marxist-Leninist Greek urban guerrilla group Revolutionary Organization 17 November (17N).

== Biography ==
Giotopoulos was born in Paris in 1944, the son of Dimitris Giotopoulos. He was raised in Chalandri and in 1962 he returned to Paris where he studied mathematics and economics. Several decades later, from inside the prison, he continued his studies with a Master in Theoretical Mathematics and later he earned a PhD degree from the University of Paris.

He was part of the United Democratic Left, and later, an opponent of the Greek military junta of 1967-1974. On 29th of August 1972 he participated in the bombing of the US embassy in Greece.

== Revolutionary Organization 17 November ==
17N was responsible for a series of armed robberies, bombings, and assassinations of prominent Greek and foreign politicians, journalists, diplomats, and businessmen that left twenty-three people dead. Giotopoulos was identified as its leader after the arrest and confession of Savvas Xiros, another member of 17N, following a failed bombing attempt on a hydrofoil shipping company in Piraeus.

Giotopoulos appealed his conviction, and described himself as the victim of &quot;an Anglo-American conspiracy&quot;. At the start of his appeal, in 2005, he received support from left-wing organisations and personalities in France, where he was born, including Alain Krivine and Pierre Vidal-Naquet. However, on May 3, 2007, his conviction and those of his 17N accomplices were sustained by the court of appeals.

<text>Simon David Upton (born 7 February 1958) is a former New Zealand politician and member of Parliament from 1981 to 2001, representing the National Party, and the current Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment.

==Early life==
Upton was educated at Southwell School, St Paul&#x27;s Collegiate School and the University of Auckland, where he gained degrees in English literature, music and law, and Wolfson College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar.

==Member of Parliament==



Having joined the National Party in 1976, he served as Chairman of the New Zealand Young Nationals among other positions and became the then-youngest MP for Waikato in the 1981 election. In the 1984 election, he was elected MP for Raglan, which he held until the 1996 election, when he chose to become a list MP.

===Cabinet minister===

Upton became one of New Zealand&#x27;s youngest ever Ministers in the Cabinet in 1990, when he became Minister of Health, Minister for the Environment, and Minister of Research, Science and Technology.

In 1970, Major Salik was posted in Dacca, and became the public relations officer in the ISPR East Pakistan of Eastern Command. Major Salik served as a military media correspondent but soon realized that the separate section of army had begun a successful mutiny and advised for the formation of truth and reconciliation commission to end the bloodshed, though his advises were not heeded.

He joined the senior military staff at the GHQ Dacca as a Public Relations Officer, working to release official statements made by the Eastern Command that was led by its Commander East, Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan, and later A.A.K. Niazi. On 20 December 1971, he was taken as POW by the Indian Army when Commander Eastern Command Gen Niazi signed to concede the defeat and was flown to Calcutta to be imprisoned in the military barracks along with Niazi and Admiral Sharif . While imprisoned, he was described by the Indian Army&#x27;s officials as &quot;intelligent, indefatigable, and admirable who was ignored by Niazi and others.&quot;

About the war prisoners, Major Salik reportedly maintained that most of the war prisoners were given to believe that in two-to-three months, they will be repatriated back to Pakistan via trains to Wagha checkpoint and ships to Karachi port. However, these hopes were dashed when the prisoners had to wait years to be repatriated to Pakistan.

===&quot;Witness to Surrender&quot; and Inter-Services Public Relations===

The book has its significance and considered an eyewitness report on the committed genocide committed under the responsibility of Pakistani military and the Mukti Bahini (lit. Freedom Army), since the War Report was never declassified.

Lieutenant-Colonel Salik also published the Urdu version of the book, title as: &quot;ميں نے ڈھاكه ڈوبتے ديكھا&quot; (lit. Witness to Surrender) in 1986, which was a translation of his English text. In his book, Salik presented a view of soldiers and sailors serving in the army and navy in a crucial period of insurgency and the politics that revolved around the Yahya administration, which eventually led to the independence of Bangladesh.

In 1979, Salik joined the army staff at the Army GHQ as public relations officer, and began working as speechwriter for President Zia-ul-Haq.

<text>Belinda Jane Vernon (born 1958) is a former New Zealand politician. She was an MP from 1996 to 2002, representing the National Party.

==Early life==
Vernon attended Remuera Intermediate School (1970–71) and Diocesan School for Girls (1972–76). She gained a BComm from the University of Auckland. She commenced her professional life as an accountant for a London shipping company. Back in New Zealand, she became financial controller, and then company secretary, for a trans-Tasman shipping company.

==Member of Parliament==

The voters of the Auckland seat of Maungakiekie elected Vernon as their electorate Member of Parliament in the 1996 election, but she lost the seat to Labour&#x27;s Mark Gosche in the 1999 election, returning to Parliament as a list MP. In the 2002 election she failed to re-take Maungakiekie, and owing to the collapse of National&#x27;s vote that year, was not high enough on the party list to return to Parliament.

From 2001, Vernon served as National&#x27;s spokesperson for Transport and for Arts, Culture and Heritage.

==After politics==
Vernon was a trustee of the Motutapu Restoration Trust from 2002 to 2012. On 1 July 2011 she was appointed as a director at GNS Science. On 27 February 2013 she was appointed to the board of Maritime New Zealand.

<text>Germán Rieckehoff Sampayo (February 5, 1915 – September 2, 1997) was a Puerto Rican nationalist of German descent, who served as president of the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee.

==Early years==
Germán Rieckehoff Sampayo was born on February 5, 1915, in Vieques, Puerto Rico to Puerto Rican parents of German descent, who were poor farmers (jíbaros) who provided him with his basic needs and a good education. He was raised in a homestead owned by his parents. Their relative, Carlos Vélez Rieckehoff, was an important leader of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and he followed the cause of independence himself.

Rieckehoff had an athletic youth and when young he was an expert swimmer. In 1947, Rieckehoff founded an association of Viequenses to fight the presence of the United States Navy in his home-island of Vieques. He enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law where he earned his law degree and also earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commercial administration from the University of Minnesota. It was during his university years that he became involved with the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, eventually becoming the president of the committee. He was a member of the 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games organizing committee.

==Puerto Rican Olympic Committee==
In 1980, the United States boycotted the Olympic Games in Moscow, Soviet Union, protesting the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. Rieckehoff was against the boycott because he believed that politics should not get involved with sporting events. He was, therefore, denied economic support from the local government. Rieckehoff did however, manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico. Alberto Mercado, became the only United States citizen to participate in the 1980 Olympics in the boxing event.

==The Barceló incident==
In 1982, the Government of Puerto Rico, headed by then governor Carlos Romero Barceló, withheld economic support from the athletic delegation headed to Cuba, where the Central American and Caribbean Games were going to be held. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Rieckehoff, had to appeal directly to the people for donations and were able to send the delegation.

==The Albergue Olimpico (Olympic Hostel)==

Rieckehoff oversaw the construction of the &quot;Olympic Village&quot; in Carolina for the VIII Pan American Games, held in Puerto Rico in 1979 and he also oversaw the construction of the Albergue Olímpico (Olympic Hostel) in Salinas. He donated the land for the establishment of the &quot;Regional Development Center&quot;.

==Later years==
In the late 1980s, Rieckehoff traveled to Lausanne, Switzerland, and at the International Olympic Committee headquarters, he requested that the 2004 Olympic Games be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He pointed out that the success of the Pan American Games held in the island had proved that Puerto Rico had the facilities capable of holding an event such as the Olympics. The committee took his request into consideration but, after some years of studying the situation, decided for Athens, Greece to hold the games instead.

Rieckehoff indicated in a speech that he feared that sports professionals were gaining more control than the partisans of the Olympics. He also believed that the salaried professionals and administrators automatically thought that they knew what was best for the Olympics, when in reality the partisans were the ones with the proper knowledge.

On September 2, 1997, Germán Rieckehoff was in Lausanne, Switzerland when he fell ill. He was rushed on an ambulance plane with his wife, Irma Gonzalez, a sports leader in her own right, and son Germán, but died on the flight. His remains were returned to Puerto Rico, where he received a hero&#x27;s funeral. He was survived by his wife, Irma, who died on May 3, 2006, their children, Angelita, Germán and Juan Adolfo Rieckehoff.

==Honors and recognitions==
In his honor, the Albergue Olympico (Salinas, Puerto Rico) was renamed and is now known as the &quot;Germán Rieckehoff Albergue Olympico&quot;, which also houses his gravesite, where his remains lie along with those of his wife. There is also a Germán Rieckehoff High School in Vieques and one in Virginia. On August 16, 2003, the Puerto Rican Legislature passed Law # 182 which established the &quot;Germán Rieckehoff Sampayo Medal&quot; of the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly for excellence in sports. The medal is to be presented annually the sportsperson whose local or international accomplishments have helped keep the image of Puerto Rican sports among the best.

<text>The Vympel K-13 (NATO reporting name: AA-2 &quot;[[Atoll]]&quot;) is a short-range, infrared homing air-to-air missile developed by the Soviet Union. It is similar in appearance and function to the American AIM-9B Sidewinder from which it was reverse-engineered. Although it since has been replaced by more modern missiles in frontline service, it saw widespread service in many nations.

==Background - the Sidewinder missile==
During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, Taiwan&#x27;s F-86 Sabres faced the much higher performance mainland Chinese PLAAF MiG-17s. The MiG-17s had speed, maneuverability, and altitude advantages over the Sabres, allowing them to engage only when they desired, normally at advantageous times. In response, the US Navy rushed to modify 100 ROCAF Sabres to carry the newly introduced AIM-9 Sidewinder missile. These were introduced into combat on 24 September 1958, when a group of MiG-17s cruised past a flight of Sabres, only for them to be attacked by missiles. This was the first instance of guided missiles being used in air-to-air combat.

On 28 September 1958, a similar engagement resulted in one of the missiles becoming lodged in a MiG-17 without exploding, allowing it to be removed after landing. The Soviets later became aware that the Chinese had at least one Sidewinder, and after some wrangling, were able to persuade the Chinese to send them one of the captured missiles. Gennadiy Sokolovskiy, later chief engineer at the Vympel team, said that &quot;the Sidewinder missile was to us a university offering a course in missile construction technology which has upgraded our engineering education and updated our approach to production of future missiles.&quot;

A subsequent claim was made by Ron Westrum in his book &quot;Sidewinder&quot; that the Soviets obtained the plans for the Sidewinder from Swedish Colonel and convicted spy Stig Wennerström, and rushed their version into service by 1961 copying it so closely that even the part numbers were duplicated. Although Wennerström did leak information of the Sidewinder after negotiating its purchase for Sweden, none of the known Soviet sources mention this, while all explicitly mention the Chinese example.

==Development and early use==

The Sidewinder was quickly reverse engineered as the K-13 (also called R-3 or Object 300) and entered limited service only two years later in 1960. This was followed by the improved K-13A (R-3S, Object 310), which entered service in 1962. The R-3S was the first version to enter widespread production, in spite of a very long seeker settling time on the order of 22 seconds, as opposed to 11 seconds for the original version.

The R-3S was seen by the West in 1961 and given the NATO reporting name AA-2A &#x27;Atoll&#x27;. Minimum engagement range for the R-3S is about one kilometre. All K-13 variants are physically similar to Sidewinder, sharing the 5 inch (127 mm) diameter. Subsequent examination of AA-2 missiles captured by NATO forces showed that parts from an AIM-9 could be interchanged with parts from an AA-2 and either combination would still work. 

In 1962, work started on a semi-active radar homing (SARH) version for high-altitude use, the K-13R (R-3R or Object 320) with 8 km range, similar to the little-used US Navy AIM-9C Sidewinder (carried by the F-8 Crusader). This took longer to develop, and while its first launches were in 1963, it did not enter service until 1967, alongside the radar required for it, the RP-22S, on the MiG-21S, produced from 1965. This missile was available on all subsequent MiG-21 variants. This version was designated AA-2B by NATO.

Three training versions were also developed. The R-3U (&quot;uchebnaya&quot;, training) was an empty missile body with a homing set, allowing pilots to get used to the aiming of the system. The R-3P (&quot;prakticheskaya&quot;, practice) was a complete missile without an explosive warhead. The RM-3V (&quot;raketa-mishen&quot;, target-missile) served as an aerial target.

==Later versions==

The Vympel team started working on a more ambitious upgrade in the late 1960s, emerging as the K-13M (R-13M, Object 380) for the IRH and K-13R (R-3R) for the SARH variant, were developed in the late 1960s. These were dubbed Advanced Atoll (AA-2C and AA-2D, respectively) in the west. The R-13M was roughly equivalent to the improved USN AIM-9G Sidewinder, with a new proximity fuse, more propellant for longer range, better maneuverability, and a more sensitive nitrogen-cooled seeker head. None were all-aspect missiles. The same electronics upgrades were also applied to the Kaliningrad K-5 (AA-1) to arm fighters that did not carry the K-13.

The K-13 in different versions was widely exported to the Warsaw Pact and other air forces, and remains in service with a few smaller nations. A license-built version called A-91 was built in Romania, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China copied the K-13 as the PL-2. Updated Chinese versions were the PL-3 and PL-5. Soviet Union provided China K-13 missile technology as a part of MiG-21 fighter jet deal in 1962. In 1967, China successfully completed locally produced K-13 (PL-2) missile tests, and started to deploy this missile to combat units. It was first used to intercept USAF UAVs flown from Vietnam and other south east Asian countries to mainland China.

==Operational history==
The K-13 missile was used by North Vietnamese MiG-21 pilots. Due to the NVAF&#x27;s very limited number of MiG-21s, their common tactic was to approach an American formation at maximum reasonable speed, fire their missiles in volleys, and exit the area at maximum speed to avoid engagement.

Some of these missiles were seized by Israel during the Six-Day War in the Sinai Peninsula. They were used during the War of Attrition, by Squadron 101 (Mirage IIICJ) and probably also by 117 and 119 squadrons, all Mirage squadrons of the Israeli Air Force. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Israelis shot down dozens of MiGs – but there had been no success in using this missile, as Israeli pilots preferred to use cannons or indigenous missiles such as Shafrir 1 and Shafrir 2.

K-3 or K-13 missiles were also used during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 by the Indian Air Force; they were integrated on MiG-21FLs and used to shoot down at least two to four Pakistani F-104 Starfighters. They were used during the Yom Kippur War by the Arab Air Forces in 1973, and during the Iran–Iraq War by the Iraqi Air Force between 1980 and 1988.

On 19 August 1981, during the 1981 Gulf of Sidra incident, a Libyan Air Force Su-22 fired a K-13 missile head on at approaching US Navy F-14As; the missile was evaded.

<text>Hamilton is a city in south-western Victoria, Australia, at the intersection of the Glenelg Highway and the Henty Highway. The Hamilton Highway connects it to Geelong.

Hamilton is in the federal Division of Wannon, and is in the Southern Grampians local government area.

Hamilton claims to be the &quot;Wool Capital of the World&quot;, based on its strong historical links to sheep grazing which continue today. The city uses the tagline &quot;Greater Hamilton: one place, many possibilities&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
Hamilton was built near the junction of three traditional indigenous tribal territories—the Gunditjmara land, stretching south to the coast; the Tjapwurong land, to the north east; and the Bunganditj territory, to the west. People who lived in these areas tended to be settled rather than nomadic. The region is fertile, with ample precipitation and an abundance of flora and fauna, lessening the need to travel far for food. Historical, physical items (such as the weirs and fish traps found in Lake Condah, south of Hamilton), as well as Aboriginal accounts of early white settlers, support the local oral histories of well-established, pre-European settlements in the area.

===British colonisation===
On 12 September 1836, the explorer Major Thomas Mitchell was the first European to travel through the region. His reports of the fertility and abundance of ‘Australia Felix’ (as he called this region of Western Victoria) encouraged pastoralists to move into the area and set up large sheep runs. In 1839, squatter Charles Wedge, with his brothers, arrived in the area and established ‘The Grange&#x27; sheep station near the banks of the Grange Burn rivulet—where the town of Hamilton now stands.

There soon followed significant conflict between Wedge&#x27;s men and the local Aboriginal people. Wedge reported attacks on his shepherds, and the loss of hundreds of sheep and other livestock; in 1840, the killing of Patrick Codd—who had been employed on The Grange—led to at least three separate punitive expeditions by Wedge and co., resulting in the deaths of at least ten Aboriginal people. Wedge infamously had a swivel gun mounted outside of his homestead to ‘deter’ the local people from approaching the house. Regarding his extensive conflicts with the local tribes, Wedge claimed that the &quot;depredations did not cease till many lives were sacrificed&quot;.

The &quot;frequent collisions&quot; compelled the squatters of the area to go so far as to request protection from the government. In 1842, temporary protection came from troopers of the Native Police, under Captain Henry Dana, and from the Border Police of New South Wales, under Captain Foster Fyans. The police magistrate from Portland, James Blair, and the new position of police magistrate to The Grange, Acheson French, were also appointed by Governor Charles Latrobe to &quot;check the collision between the natives and the settlers&quot;.

===Birth of the town===
The proximity of The Grange to other properties and to important routes between Portland and New South Wales, led to the gradual emergence of a small town. This settlement featured an inn, a blacksmith, a small store and some random shanties and businesses nearby. The site was a local social centre and meeting point for the surrounding pastoral properties; horse races were held along the Grange Burn flat.
A postal office opened on 1 July 1844 (Hamilton from 1 January 1854).

The desire for a school prompted a town survey, which commenced in 1849. The township of Hamilton was formally declared in 1851. The town was named in the following way as quoted by the book &quot;Dundas Shire Centenary 1863-1963&quot;, page 58. Quote: &quot; &quot;In 1840, owing to police difficulties in controlling public houses on, or not on the imaginary boundary line, Henry Wade was sent from Sydney on a special mission to mark out the boundary. He completed the survey as far as Serviceton by the spring of 1847, and was then appointed District Surveyor and in 1850, laid out a township for the Grange, which he named Hamilton. It was then the prerogative of the surveyor to christen his lay-out. Wade and his family had made close friends of the Hamiltons and Gibsons of Bringalbert, there being intermarriages later.&quot;&quot;

The railway reached the town in 1877 and, along with the local railway station, would become a hub of several branch lines until their eventual closures in 1977 and 1979.

Hamilton was proclaimed as a city on 22 November 1949.

== Heritage listings ==
Hamilton contains a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 43 Gray Street: Hamilton Mechanics Institute
* 57 Gray Street: Hamilton Post Office
* Kennedy, Martin, French and Thompson Streets: Hamilton Botanic Gardens
* 14 Tyers Street: Hamilton Tuberculosis Chalet
* 2-16 Craig Street: Hamilton Gas Holder

==Industry and employment==
Sheep grazing and agriculture are the primary industries in the surrounding shire, the area producing as much as 15% of Australia&#x27;s total wool clip. Inside the city of Hamilton the majority of employment is provided by the retail industry (20%) and the Health and Community Services sector (14.5%). Education is another large employer, with four Secondary Schools, two of which enrol both primary and secondary students, as well as a number of stand-alone primary schools. The unemployment rate at the 2001 Census was put at 6.1%, with a workforce participation rate of 58.9%.

==Climate==
Like most of south-western Victoria, Hamilton has a temperate mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;). Cold fronts regularly sweep in from the Southern Ocean. Although daytime temperatures occasionally reach into the 30s even 40s during summer, daytime temperatures in the mid teens will often linger into December and are not uncommon even during the high summer months. On average Hamilton has 105 days per year with more than 1 mm of rain with a marked minimum during Summer. The town has 56.3 clear days annually. 

It is significantly cloudier than Melbourne due to its elevation and westerly exposure, averaging 1,995 hours of sunshine annually. Though snow is rare, it saw significant snowfalls on 26 July 1901 and 11 October 1910.

==Media==
===Newspaper===
Hamilton and the surrounding areas is serviced by &quot;The Hamilton Spectator&quot;, a tri-weekly local newspaper published by the Spectator Observer newspaper group. Established in 1859 as the Hamilton Courier, it became the Hamilton Spectator and Grange District Advertiser in 1860, and later The Hamilton Spectator.

===Television services===

Local Television is transmitted from Mt Dundas Melville Forest in the VHF Band Channel 5 to 12. ABC TV, SBS TV, WIN (Nine), Seven and Southern Cross (Ten). UHF child sites exist in Coleraine ABC TV only on UHF from McKenrys Hill and Casterton from Seeleys Hill, All Services, which are on UHF. All services are DTV-B and require appropriate antenna to receive correctly. Unlike capital cities service runs on lower power and requires correct antenna. Caravan antenna for travellers might not work well. Neither will indoor aerials.

===Radio===

There are two radio stations based in Hamilton:

* 3HA
* Mixx FM

Both are owned by the Ace Radio network, which operates radio stations in the Western District of Victoria.

Many other radio stations broadcast into Hamilton, including national broadcasters the ABC transmitting from Mt Dundas Melville Forest over much of Western Victoria including outlets at Warrnambool, Portland, and Ballarat.

Stations are ABC News Radio 91.7, ABC Radio National 92.5, ABC Classic FM 93.3, ABC Local Radio 94.1, and JJJ Youth Radio 94.9. ABC local radio is broadcast out of Studios in Warrnambool via Mt Clay Portland on 96.9 which is relayed to Mt Dundas. Local Programming is during breakfast times only and often is sourced from Horsham and Ballarat Studios. AM radio 3WL on 1602 is audible in Hamilton as is 3WV on 594 from Horsham. There are also low power narrowcast services on fm in Hamilton which change from time to time. KIX Country is currently transmitting sport and racing. Vision FM currently transmits in Hamilton and Casterton. There are plans to convert 3HA to FM and change the AM service possibly to sport.
Recent demolition at Melville oval saw the old 3HA broadcast box used for football since the 1949s removed.

====Airports====

Hamilton is serviced by an all weather airport located at Hensley Park approximately 11 km North of Hamilton. A long bitumen North South Runway can take up aircraft up to Dash 8 size as well as small jet aircraft. A gravel runway is aligned NW and SE. A CFA fire base and control centre is located at the Hamilton Airport as well as a modern terminal building and toilets. Hamilton Aero Club has its club rooms and hangar there and is open most Saturdays. AVGAS Key lock card fueling is available 24/7. Turbine fuel by arrangement. There is no airline service to Hamilton, only charter flights and as such the airport is not staffed. Pilot activated lights on:124.2 are available and an automatic weather service details on NAIPS. A non directional radio beacon on 203 kHz for instrument approaches, is one of very few NDBs remaining. For all details consult the Air Services ERSA.

==Attractions and events==

In 1881 William Guilfoyle, the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne was employed to design the Hamilton Botanic Gardens. Set in , the gardens are distinguished by rare botanic species, a superbly restored rotunda, a small zoo featuring rabbits, cockatiels and budgerigars and playground and the ornate Thomson Fountain. The garden at one point housed an emu, however, it was illegally shot in 2012. The National Trust of Australia classified the gardens in 1990 with eight tree species listed on the Register of Significant Trees in Victoria.

Hamilton Gallery Established in 1961, Hamilton Gallery&#x27;s renowned collection features collection of gouache and watercolour pictures by English landscape painter Paul Sandby (1731-1809).

Sheepvention, a wool-related trade-show and exhibition is held in the Hamilton Show-grounds in the first Monday &amp; Tuesday of August each year, and attracts up to 20,000 visitors. It has a similar feel to an Agricultural show but is focused on wool and sheep. The Hamilton Agricultural Show is normally held in November.

The Big Wool Bales was an attraction (now demolished) it consisted of five linked structures designed to resemble five gigantic woolbales - a tribute to the importance of the local wool industry. Together they formed a building and a cafe containing wool-related displays such as historical memorabilia, including farming and shearing equipment, wool scales, old horse harnesses, wool presses and weaving looms, along with wool samples and rural clothing.

The Keeping Place is a small museum and living history centre run by local indigenous people.

The Sir Reginald Ansett Transport Museum celebrates the founding of Ansett Australia in Hamilton in 1935 and displays items from the early days of the Ansett Airlines&#x27; operation.

==Sport==
There are many sporting clubs and leagues in the Hamilton area. The city is served by one Australian rules football team; Hamilton Kangaroos . This team competes in the Hampden Football League. 
The city formerly had 2 teams, Hamilton Magpies and Hamilton Imperials, which played in the Western Border Football League. The teams agreed to merge at the end of the 2012 season in order to make the move to the Hampden Football League.

Netball, field hockey, basketball, soccer, tennis and cricket are other popular sports in the city. Hamilton opened a large Indoor Sports and Aquatic Centre in March 2006, which contains four basketball courts, a twenty-five-metre indoor swimming pool, 4 squash courts, a table tennis centre with 8 courts and a large gym. The city is also the home of the Hamilton Rowing Club (HRC) which competes in Rowing Victoria regattas during the summer. The Hamilton and Alexandra College Rowing Club (HACRC) sometimes compete in such events or attempt to train. Tucked behind the Historical Society in Gray Street, is the Hamilton 8-Ball and Snooker Club.

Hamilton has a horse racing club, the Hamilton Racing Club, which schedules around nine race meetings a year including the Hamilton Cup meeting in April. As well as a harness racing club which has recently opened a new track, with state-of-the-art facilities.
Golfers play at the Hamilton Golf Club or at the more minor course Parklands on Boundary and Hensley Park Roads.

== Wildlife and parks ==
The eastern barred bandicoot is a marsupial native to the area, and a reserve has been built to protect this and other endangered species. In more recent decades (2007), the numbers of bandicoot (both within the reserve and outside of it) have declined significantly—to the point of nearing extinction—as a result of extended drought, and predation by introduced red foxes as well as feral cats. Competition for food with the introduced rabbits is another major issue affecting the marsupials. Within the city, the public lands adjoining the river and Lake Hamilton have been subject to spasmodic tree-planting projects.

Mount Napier—the highest point on the Western District Plains—is found south of Hamilton.

==Education==
Primary schools in Hamilton include Hamilton (Gray Street) Primary School, George Street Primary School, Hamilton North Primary School and Saint Mary&#x27;s Primary School. Secondary schools include Hamilton and Alexandra College, Baimbridge College and Monivae College. There are two Primary to Year 12 schools: Hamilton and Alexandra College and Good Shepherd College.

Hamilton Special School caters to primary school-age students who have special education needs, predominantly autistic spectrum disorders and communication difficulties.

South West Institute of Technical and Further Education (TAFE) has a campus in Hamilton, offering post-secondary and trade courses and qualifications. 
RMIT maintains a training and research site 4 km from the centre of Hamilton, which is home to the Potter Rural Community Research Network. Vocational training at the site is delivered by South West TAFE while master&#x27;s degrees and PhDs by research are facilitated by RMIT.

<text>Berwick is a small farming community on the banks of the Waipori River at the southwestern limit of Dunedin city, New Zealand, some 40 kilometres from the city centre. It lies close to the border with Clutha District. To the south of Berwick is the Berwick Forest, a large pine plantation.

Berwick is also the location of one of the Otago Youth Adventure Trust&#x27;s campsites.

It is unclear which Berwick the community is named after, but the leading candidate is Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland.

<text>Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk (, ; 10 January 1934 – 10 May 2022) was a Ukrainian politician and the first president of Ukraine, serving from 5 December 1991 until 19 July 1994. In 1992, he signed the Lisbon Protocol, undertaking to give up Ukraine&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. He was also the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada and a People&#x27;s Deputy of Ukraine serving in the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united) faction.

After a political crisis involving the president and the prime minister, Kravchuk resigned from the presidency, but ran for a second term as president in 1994. He was defeated by his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma, who then served as president for two terms. After his presidency, Kravchuk remained active in Ukrainian politics, serving as a People&#x27;s Deputy of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada and the leader of the parliamentary group of Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united) from 2002 to 2006.

==Early life==
Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk was born on 10 January 1934 in the village of Velykyi Zhytyn (&quot;Żytyń Wielki&quot;) to an ethnic Ukrainian peasant family. At that time the village was part of Poland (Second Polish Republic). It became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic after the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 when Kravchuk was a child. His father served in the Polish army during the 1930s, and later he and his wife worked for the local osadniks (Polish colonists). During World War II, Kravchuk&#x27;s father perished on the front lines.

Kravchuk married a mathematics teacher, Antonina Mykhailivna Mishura, in 1957. First Lady of the United States from 1989 to 1993, Barbara Bush (wife of the 41st President of the United States George H. W. Bush), described Antonina in her memoirs: &quot;She was the nicest young woman, a math teacher with absolutely no interest in politics&quot;.

Kravchuk went to a vocational school before studying Marxist political economy at Kyiv University. He graduated at 24 and became a political economy teacher in Chernivtsi, in southwest Ukraine, before entering politics. Kravchuk joined the Communist Party of Ukraine in 1958 and rose through the ranks of the party and of its &quot;agitprop&quot; department.

Kravchuk took part in the International Visitor Leadership Program, a professional exchange run by the US State Department.

==Presidency==

=== Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR ===

He became a member of the Ukrainian Communist Party Bureau in 1989, and on 23 July 1990, became Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR, becoming the republic&#x27;s nominal head of state. On 24 October 1990, the monopoly of the Communist Party of Ukraine on power was abolished, and thus, Kravchuk became not only the nominal, but also the actual head of the republic.

After the 19–21 August 1991 Soviet coup attempt, Kravchuk, who did not support the attempt to remove Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev from power, resigned from the Communist Party. After the Verkhovna Rada passed the Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine on 24 August, the constitution was amended to create the post of President of Ukraine. Before the vote for the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine Kravchuk was instrumental in persuading the communists parliamentary majority to accept the opposition&#x27;s demands of Ukrainian Independence. Participants in the Belovezha talks said Kravchuk rejected any efforts to keep the Soviet Union going with reforms.

Following the Act of Declaration of Independence Kravchuk was vested with presidential powers, thus becoming both &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; head of state. Later that year, on 5 December 1991, voters formally elected him president in Ukraine&#x27;s first presidential election. Just a few days before on 1 December, the voters voted overwhelmingly to secede from the Soviet Union—a move which Kravchuk now fully supported. This made Kravchuk the first head of state of independent Ukraine.

=== President of Ukraine ===
On 25 February 1992, as President of Ukraine, Kravchuk, issued Presidential decree 98/92 &quot;About the changes in the system of central bodies of executive power of Ukraine&quot;.

On 6 May 1992, Kravchuk met President George H. W. Bush in the United States and signed an agreement for the full removal of all nuclear tactical weapons from Ukrainian territory by 1 July, and in return obtained a credit line of $110 million to buy U.S. commodities. It led to the signing of the Budapest Memorandum. The document was signed on 5 December 1994 at the summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Budapest. In it, Ukraine, a nuclear power at that time, voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees.

Kravchuk achieved and strengthened the formal sovereignty of the country. He took a pro-European stance, developing relations with the West and signing a cooperation accord with the European Union. The Kravchuk administration walked a tightrope between escalation of Ukrainian–Russian tensions and a policy of cooperation with Moscow.

Kravchuk refused to retain the common armed forces and currency inside the Commonwealth of Independent States. On 2 July 1993, the Ukrainian parliament approved the statement; &#x27;Ukraine advocates the creation of an all-embracing international system of universal and all-European security and considers participation [therein] a basic component of its national security&#x27;.

Ukraine under Kravchuk welcomed the idea of NATO enlargement. As president, he never opposed the expansion of the Alliance or the possibility of a future Ukrainian membership to NATO. This was reflected in his disdain for military cooperation with Eurasian structures, such as the Tashkent CIS Collective Security Treaty, in favour of European security structures. He said that &quot;the best guarantee to Ukraine&#x27;s security would be membership to NATO.&quot; He repeated his support for an immediate Ukrainian membership to NATO in 1994.

Ukraine and Russia argued over many issues, including how the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet should be divided. In May 1992, Russia&#x27;s Supreme Soviet voted to declare the Soviet government&#x27;s 1954 grant of Crimea to Ukraine an illegal act. Ukraine opposed this decision. The status of the Russian Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s presence in Sevastopol and the Crimea was not resolved by a 20-year lease agreement until 1997, three years after Kravchuk left office.

Under Kravchuk&#x27;s leadership, Ukraine&#x27;s economy slumped as corruption linked to privatization of Soviet-era industry thrived. Ukraine&#x27;s economic woes caused a decline in Kravchuk&#x27;s political popularity, sparking governmental infighting. Political tension reached a point in the fall of 1993 that the then-prime minister, Leonid Kuchma, resigned. By 1994, in less than three years of Kravchuk&#x27;s presidency, the country&#x27;s GDP had shrunk by 40 percent.

Kravchuk ran for a second term as president in 1994 but was defeated by Kuchma, with his loss being attributed to the rampant graft and the declining economy.

== Post-presidency ==
Soon after his defeat in 1994, Kravchuk joined the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united) (SDPU(o)). He served as a member of the Verkhovna Rada from 1994 until the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election.

In February 2003, Oleksandr Moroz, the leader of Ukraine&#x27;s Socialist Party, accused Kravchuk and other 300 public high-ranked officials of being members of the Freemasons.

During the 2004 presidential elections Kravchuk actively supported the candidacy of Viktor Yanukovych, and was a member of the Yanukovych team that negotiated with the opposition in the aftermath of that disputed election. In November 2004 he told the media that he was afraid that the resulting crisis would cause the disintegration of the country, intensifying movements for certain regions of Ukraine to join other countries.

On 25 September 2009, Kravchuk declared during an interview with the newspaper &quot;Den&quot; that he left SDPU(o) and became unaffiliated again. He explained this based on the fact that his former party decided to join the Bloc of Left and Center-left Forces to run for the 2010 presidential elections. He was indignant due to the fact that the political council of the party decided to accomplish that behind the closed doors in non-democratic order. He called it [the] &quot;block as the artificial union without any perspectives&quot;. Kravchuk endorsed Yulia Tymoshenko during the 2010 presidential elections campaign.

During the 2010 election campaign, he accused incumbent president Viktor Yushchenko of having &quot;turned into Yanukovych&#x27;s aide. He has actually turned into an also-ran. His task is to slander Yulia Tymoshenko every day and prevent her from winning [the presidential elections]&quot;. Kravchuk explained his shift in support from Yanukovych to Tymoshenko was caused because he felt Yanukovych &quot;turned his back&quot; on all the issues Kravchuk wanted him to address as president: the Ukrainian language, culture, and the Holodomor. &quot;Only the dead or the stupid do not change their views&quot;, he stated in December 2009 when he also voiced the opinion that voting for Yanukovych in the second round of the 2010 elections would indicate an anti-Ukrainian position.

In July 2020, Kravchuk was chosen to represent Ukraine at the Trilateral Contact Group (formed to facilitate a diplomatic resolution to the war in Donbas), being appointed to replace Leonid Kuchma. He maintained this position until February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine.

== Death and funeral ==
Kravchuk had heart surgery in June 2021. He was reportedly in ill health by this time. On 29 June 2021, he missed the solemn meeting of the Verkhovna Rada on the occasion of Constitution Day due to heart surgery. After surgery, Kravchuk was placed in intensive care and connected to a ventilator. In July, the media reported that Kravchuk had been in intensive care for a month.

On 10 May 2022, a family member told the Ukrainian News Agency that Kravchuk had died at the age of 88, after a long illness. His death was also confirmed by unnamed officials in Kyiv, as well as Andriy Yermak, head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s office. He died a week after Belarus&#x27;s Stanislav Shushkevich, another signatory to the Belovezh Accords, died in Minsk. On 11 May, President Zelenskyy issued a decree establishing the Kravchuk Prize in his memory.

His funeral ceremony took place on 17 May at the Ukrainian House in Kyiv, and was attended by President Zelenskyy and First Lady Olena Zelenska as well as three former presidents of Ukraine: Leonid Kuchma, Viktor Yushchenko, and Petro Poroshenko. In addition, guests included his wife Antonina, Mayor Vitali Klitschko of Kyiv, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov, and former politicians Oleksandr Kuzmuk, Oleksandr Moroz, and Mustafa Dzhemilev. He was buried at Baikove Cemetery.

==Personal life ==
Kravchuk married Antonina Mykhailivna Mishura in 1957. She rarely attended official events with her husband.

Kravchuk and his wife had one child, Oleksandr Leonidovych Kravchuk (born 1959), president of the State Company &quot;Nafkom-Ahro&quot; and the former FC Nafkom Brovary. Kravchuk had two grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. After Kravchuk stopped working for the Ukrainian state, he lived in a state-owned dacha in Koncha-Zaspa.

== Legacy ==
He is often associated as a key figure in achieving Ukraine&#x27;s independence and in giving up Ukraine&#x27;s nuclear arsenal.

Former Belarusian leader, Stanislav Shushkevich, who took part in the Belovezha talks and signed the deal, said; &quot;Kravchuk was focused on Ukraine&#x27;s independence, he was proud that Ukraine declared its independence in a referendum and he was elected president on 1 December 1991.&quot; Following his death, Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Oleksii Reznikov, said, &quot;Thank you for the peaceful renewal of our Independence. We&#x27;re defending it now with weapons in our hands.&quot; Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, said it was &quot;Sad news and a great loss,&quot; describing Kravchuk as &quot;a wise patriot of Ukraine, a truly historical figure in gaining our independence.&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid tribute to Kravchuk, calling him not just a historical figure but &quot;a man who knew how to find wise words and to say them so that all Ukrainians would hear them.&quot;

<text>Tudḫaliya IV was a king of the Hittite Empire (New kingdom), and the younger son of Ḫattušili III. He reigned –1215 BC (middle chronology) or –1209 BC (short chronology). His mother was the great queen, Puduḫepa.

==Early life==
Tudḫaliya was likely born in his father&#x27;s court in Ḫattuša, after his brother and crown prince Nerikkaili, but still while their father was governing on his brother Muwatalli II&#x27;s behalf. He was a good friend of Muwatalli&#x27;s son, Kurunta, and Ḫattušili ordered that they stay on good terms.

After Ḫattušili III as King wrote up a treaty with &quot;Ulmi-Tessup&quot; which confirmed Kurunta&#x27;s rule over Tarḫuntašša, Ḫattušili elevated Tudḫaliya over his older brother to be his crown prince. Tudḫaliya as king drew up a bronze tablet treaty confirming the links between him and Kurunta.

Tudḫaliya had a sister, Maathorneferure, who served as Great Royal Wife to Pharaoh Ramesses II of Egypt.

==Reign==
The Hittite Empire covered large parts of Anatolia and Syria. Climate change set with drier conditions that caused a severe drought. Tudḫaliya IV responded by building at least 13 dams to secure water supplies, one of which still survives to this day at Alacahöyük.

In the East, Tudḫaliya IV faced the rival Assyrians. He suffered a severe defeat at the hands of Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria in the Battle of Nihriya, .

Tudḫaliya, king of the Hittites, was reeling from defeat by the Assyrians at the Battle of Nihriya, refers to the Babylonian king as his equal, in his treaty with his vassal, Šaušgamuwa of Amurru, hinting at the possible existence of an alliance or at least a tacit understanding between them. It reads:

In the Southwest, the empire had been divided with parts of the territory controlled by Kurunta of Tarḫuntašša.

A clay tablet (CTH 121), dating to the reign of Šuppiluliuma II, tells that a statue was set up by Tudḫaliya IV to commemorate his conquest of the Land of Alasiya (Cyprus?).

Tudḫaliya IV had two sons, Arnuwanda III and Šuppiluliuma II, who are considered the final two kings of the Hittite Empire.

<doc id="1098024" wikidata="Q7418777" url="?curid=1098024" title="Sanky-panky">
<text>A sanky-panky or sanky is a male sex worker, found in the Dominican Republic. A sanky-panky solicits on beaches and has clients of either both sexes or only women. When with men, the sanky-panky assumes an active (a.k.a. top) role, but when with women, assumes the role of an ideal lover. 

While strictly speaking they are not prostitutes, since they do not directly negotiate money for sex, sanky-pankies are more likely to develop a pseudo-relationship which can be continued after the guest returns home. They then might attempt to ask for money to be sent to them primarily by wire transfer, often using elaborate stories of need, involving (for example) sick relatives. A sanky&#x27;s ultimate goal is often to obtain a marriage visa to the tourist&#x27;s native country, and marry the tourist before abandoning her.

Another word used for a sanky panky is &quot;chapeador&quot; (or chapi chapi) A lady is called a &quot;chapeadora&quot;. This word is derived from the verb &quot;chapear&quot; (to trim or cut, especially with a machete).

==Bricheros==
In Peru they are known as &quot;bricheros&quot; (who are male and usually target female tourists) and &quot;bricheras&quot; (who are females targeting male tourists). They frequent popular tourist destinations and may involve themselves in tourist businesses in order to solicit customers.

==&quot;Puta-Tour&quot;==
In certain tourist cities of Venezuela, and specially in the city of Mérida, women following a similar pattern of conduct are known as &quot;Puta-Tour,&quot; a pejorative term associated with travel-based prostitution. Nevertheless, there are cases where sexual intercourse is never consummated and long term friendships are the result. Such women usually target White American and European tourists, primarily in the interest of learning and/or practicing a foreign language other than Spanish, serving also as hosts and tourist guides, but with the expectation of being invited to travel to the tourist&#x27;s native country. These relationships can range from friendship to marriage, and are based on cultural interchange and travel, supported by the foreign tourist.

==Sanky-pankies in popular culture==
The persona of the &quot;sanky panky&quot; was brought to the cinema in 2007 by Spanish director Jose E. Pintor. In his comedic film entitled &quot;Sanky Panky&quot;, audiences follow the life of a young Dominican man named Genaro (played by Dominican comedian Fausto Mata) who, thanks to his childhood friend Giuseppe (Massimo Borghetti), the manager of a hotel chain, travels to Bávaro to work at a resort in hopes of finding a &quot;gringa&quot; (or white American woman) who will give him a visa. In the process, he meets a young heartbroken woman and her two older and oversexed aunts. The story that follows highlights the attractions of Dominican resorts but also portrays the realities of poverty in the Dominican Republic, while immortalizing the figure of the &quot;sanky panky&quot; via the medium of a major motion picture.

A film that explores this topic in a Francophone context is &quot;Heading South&quot;.

<text>Jodi Christine Phillis (born 11 April 1965 in Melbourne, Australia) is an Australian singer-songwriter-guitarist and founding member of the band The Clouds. Phillis is best known for her vocal ability in many of her songs, such as &quot;Hieronymus&quot;, &quot;Souleater&quot; and &quot;Ghost of Love Returned&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Melbourne, Phillis spent her childhood in California, and moved back to Sydney, Australia to begin school. She quit school at 15, then spent eight years working as a graphic artist with surfwear company Mambo Graphics until she formed the band The Clouds, where she met fellow frontwoman and bassist Trish Young.

==Career==
===1989–1997: The Clouds===

The Clouds formed in December 1989 and released four studio albums between 1990 and 1996, all of which peaked within the ARIA top 50.

===1996–present: Solo===
While still in The Clouds, Phillis explored a more mellow, acoustic direction with her debut solo album &quot;Lounge o&#x27; Sound&quot;, released in 1996.

In 2001, she released &quot;In Dreams I Live&quot;. The track &quot;Waiting, Wanting, Holding&quot; was featured in the ABC&#x27;s series &quot;Love Is a Four-Letter Word&quot;. The album was nominated for two awards at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002. Her third solo album, &quot;For Lovers, Artists and Dreamers&quot;, was released in 2004.

In 2013, Phillis attended the Australian Film Television and Radio School (AFTRS), to study composition and graduated with a Certificate in Screen Music. Jodi&#x27;s screen credits include the feature film &quot;Convict&quot;, and numerous TV commercials and television shows.

In 2017, Phillis spearheaded the composer&#x27;s project, Seven Stories, in collaboration with Ensemble Offspring and six other prominent female composers, Amanda Brown, Caitlin Yeo, Sally Whitwell, Bree van Reyk, Kyls Burtland and Jane Sheldon with text by Hilary Bell. Seven Stories premiered during Sydney&#x27;s Vivid Festival.

In 2018, Phillis released her &quot;Becoming&quot; album. Produced by Tim Oxley and penned by Jodi, it was an album that covered topics such as grief, loss, love and menopause. The album was rated at number 5 in Your Music Radar&#x27;s &quot;Top 20 Best Australian Albums of 2018&quot;, with Brian Parker opining, &quot;An album that serves as a chronicle of one person&#x27;s experience of change, yet ultimately becomes therapeutic for her listener – giving hope that life and love is worth it, and with change comes positivity. A beautiful album that marks Phillis as one of Australia’s vital singer-songwriters.&quot;

===2005–2007: The Girls from the Clouds===

In 2005, Phillis reunite with former Clouds band-mate Trish Young, under the moniker The Girls from the Clouds. Their EP &quot;Lalalala&quot; was released in early 2006. After 18 months, however, Phillis and Young once again went their separate ways.

<text>The Japanese Chin (, ), also known as the Japanese Spaniel, is a toy dog breed, being both a lap dog and a companion dog, with a distinctive heritage.

==History==
While most believe that the source breed for the Japanese Chin originated in China, the route by which the Chin arrived in Japan is a widely debated topic. One story claims that the dogs were given to the Japanese royalty in AD 732 as gifts brought by Kim Jangson (), an envoy from the kingdom of Silla on the Korean peninsula. Others maintain that they were given as gifts to the Empress of Japan as early as the middle of the sixth century or by the seventh century. Still others claim that the Chin first arrived in Japan around the year AD 1000.

In 1613, the Japanese Chin was brought to England. In 1853 one was acquired by American naval officer, Matthew Calbraith Perry. Since 1868 they have been lap dogs to ladies of the upper class and today are companion dogs.

== Appearance ==

The Japanese Chin stand about approximately in height at the withers for male dogs, with bitches being slightly taller. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale gives no weight requirement for the Chin. Its distinctive expression is characterized by a large rounded broad head, large wide-set dark eyes, a very short broad muzzle, ear feathering, and evenly patterned facial markings.

===Coat and color===
Japanese Chin are very cat-like in both appearance and traits.
Most dogs have two types of hair in their coat: an under and over coat. However, the Japanese Chin only has an over coat. An adult coat can take up to two years to completely grow in and can be either black and white, red and white (including all shades of sable, lemon, or orange), or tricolour (black and white with reddish tan points) As of 11 November 2011, the colors not listed in the breed standard are grounds for disqualification in competitions.

The dogs have a dot or a line on their forehead, which is believed in Japanese history to be the touch of Buddha.

==Temperament==

This breed&#x27;s attitude has been compared to that of cats more often than other breeds: it is alert, intelligent, and independent, and it uses its paws to wash and wipe its face. Other cat-like traits include their preference for resting on high surfaces, their good sense of balance, and their tendency to hide in unexpected places. Japanese Chin are loyal to their owners and are typically a friendly breed. While Japanese Chin prefer familiar surroundings, they also do well in new situations. This, alongside their friendly demeanor, makes them good therapy dogs. Early socialization of Japanese Chin puppies leads to a more emotionally well-balanced Chin that is more accepting of different situations and people.

Japanese Chin are defensive animals and thus although they are usually quiet, they will bark to alert the arrival of a visitor or to draw attention to something out of the ordinary.

Japanese Chin were also bred for the purpose of entertaining their owners. While typically calm, they are well known for performing many tricks such as the &quot;Chin Spin&quot;, in which they turn around in rapid circles; dancing on their hind legs while pawing their front feet, clasped together, in the air; and some even &quot;sing&quot;, a noise that can range from a low trill to a higher, almost operatic noise.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.5 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Common health issues in the Japanese Chin include luxating patellas (slipping kneecaps), cataracts, and early-onset heart murmurs.

<doc id="1098028" wikidata="Q4767702" url="?curid=1098028" title="Annabel Young">
<text>Annabel Margaret Young (born 1956) is a former New Zealand politician. She was a Member of Parliament from 1997 to 2002, representing the National Party.

== Early life and family ==
Before entering politics, Young worked as a tax specialist and business consultant, being a lawyer and chartered accountant. She also spent nine years in the territorial army signal corps.

Young&#x27;s father, Bill Young, was also a National MP, representing the Miramar electorate from 1966 to 1981. One of Young&#x27;s sisters, Nicola, is a Wellington City Councillor and stood as a candidate in the Rongotai electorate in the 2005 general election, however lost to the incumbent, Annette King. Another sister, Rosemary, married National MP Max Bradford. Her great-grandfather was the early 20th-century Wellington mayor and Liberal–Reform MP John Luke.

==Member of Parliament==


Young sought the National Party candidacy in the Wellington Central electorate for the 1996 general election, but lost to Mark Thomas. Instead, she stood as a list-only candidate. Although she was not immediately successful, Young eventually entered Parliament on 23 April 1997, having been the next candidate on National&#x27;s party list when list MP Jim Gerard resigned. As Gerard had been the first list MP to resign after New Zealand adopted the mixed-member proportional electoral system in 1996, Young was the first list MP to be elected not at a general election. She said her entry to Parliament in this way was ironic given she had not supported the electoral system change that led to the introduction of list MPs.

In Young&#x27;s first term as a list MP, despite being a Wellingtonian, she was assigned by the party to be based in Hawke&#x27;s Bay. She was appointed the National Party spokesperson for senior citizens by new leader Jenny Shipley in 1997. The National Party did not stand an electorate candidate in Wellington Central in the 1999 election (having previously endorsed ACT leader Richard Prebble for the seat). Young again stood as a list-only candidate, campaigning in Wellington city, and was re-elected. With the National Party now in opposition, Young served as National&#x27;s revenue spokesperson under both Shipley and her successor, Bill English, based in Wellington.

In 2000, during debate on the Employment Relations Bill, Young was photographed yawning, and the photograph was subsequently published in &quot;The Evening Post&quot;. This prompted Speaker of the House Jonathan Hunt to ban television cameras and newspaper photographers from the House of Representatives.

In the 2002 election Young stood for a third time as a list-only candidate but, at 33rd on the list and the lowest of National&#x27;s sitting MPs, was ranked too low to escape the collapse of National&#x27;s vote that year. She had sought nomination to be the National candidate in Wellington Central, but lost to Hekia Parata. Also at that election, Young endorsed the candidacy of Judith Collins—a long-time friend—for the National candidacy in the new Clevedon electorate, over sitting MP Warren Kyd.

==Life after parliament==
After leaving Parliament, Young was tax director of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. In 2005, she became chief executive of Federated Farmers, and in 2008 moved to the Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand as Chief Executive. She resigned from the Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand in April 2012 and later became executive director of the New Zealand Shipping Federation.

She has also written a book, &quot;The Good Lobbyist&#x27;s Guide&quot;, about the most effective ways for citizens to become involved in the political process.
