<text>Paul Norton &quot;Pete&quot; McCloskey Jr. (September 29, 1927 – May 8, 2024) was an American politician who represented San Mateo County, California, as a Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1967 to 1983.

Born in Loma Linda, California, McCloskey pursued a legal career in Palo Alto, California, after graduating from Stanford Law School. He served in the Korean War as a member of the United States Marine Corps. For his service, he was awarded the Navy Cross and the Silver Star. He won election to the House of Representatives in 1967, defeating Shirley Temple in the Republican primary. He co-authored the 1973 Endangered Species Act. He unsuccessfully challenged President Richard Nixon in the 1972 Republican primaries on an anti-Vietnam War platform and was the first member of Congress to publicly call for President Nixon&#x27;s resignation after the Saturday Night Massacre.

McCloskey continually won re-election until 1982, when he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination to represent California in the United States Senate. The nomination was won by Pete Wilson, who went on to defeat Jerry Brown in the general election. During the 1988 Republican presidential primaries, McCloskey helped end Pat Robertson&#x27;s campaign by revealing that Robertson&#x27;s claims of serving in combat were false. In 1989, McCloskey co-founded the Council for the National Interest, a non-profit, non-partisan organization that works for &quot;Middle East policies that serve the American national interest.&quot; He strongly opposed the Iraq War and supported Democrat John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. In 2006, he made an unsuccessful run for Congress against Republican Richard Pombo. He endorsed Democrat Jerry McNerney in the general election and became a Democrat himself shortly thereafter.
==Early life==
Pete McCloskey&#x27;s great-grandfather was orphaned in the Great Irish Famine and came to California in 1853 at the age of 16. He and his son, McCloskey&#x27;s grandfather, were farmers in Merced County. The family were lifelong Republicans.

McCloskey was born on September 29, 1927, in Loma Linda, California, the son of Mary Vera (McNabb) and Paul Norton McCloskey. He attended public schools in South Pasadena and San Marino. He was inducted into South Pasadena High School Hall of Fame for the sport of baseball. He attended Occidental College and California Institute of Technology under the U.S. Navy&#x27;s V-5 Pilot Program. He graduated from Stanford University in 1950 and Stanford University Law School in 1953.

==Military service==
McCloskey voluntarily served in the U.S. Navy from 1945 to 1947, the U.S. Marine Corps from 1950 to 1952, the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve from 1952 to 1960 and the Ready Reserve from 1960 to 1967. He retired from the Marine Corps Reserve in 1974, having attained the rank of colonel.
He was awarded the Navy Cross and Silver Star decorations for heroism in combat and two Purple Hearts as a Marine during the Korean War. He then volunteered for the Vietnam War before eventually turning against it. In 1992, he wrote his fourth book, &quot;The Taking of Hill 610&quot;, describing some of his exploits in Korea.

==Political career==

McCloskey served as a Deputy District Attorney for Alameda County, California, from 1953 to 1954 and practiced law in Palo Alto, California, from 1955 to 1967, cofounding the firm McCloskey, Wilson &amp; Mosher, a forerunner to the firm that eventually became Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati. He was a lecturer on legal ethics at Santa Clara University and Stanford Law School from 1964 to 1967.

He was elected as a Republican to the 90th Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Representative J. Arthur Younger, after defeating Shirley Temple in the primary. He was reelected to the seven succeeding Congresses, serving from December 12, 1967, to January 3, 1983. In a 1981 interview, he stated that he thought he &quot;was the first Republican elected opposing the war&quot; despite the fact that his &quot;constituency, two to one, favored the war in 1967.&quot;

McCloskey was the first member of Congress to publicly call for the impeachment of President Nixon after the Watergate scandal and the Saturday Night Massacre. He was also the first lawmaker to call for a repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that had allowed for the War in Vietnam. He chose, in early 1975, to see for himself the effects of US bombing in Cambodia, stating afterwards that his country had committed &quot;greater evil than we have done to any country in the world, and wholly without reason, except for our benefit to fight against the Vietnamese.&quot;
In the 1972 Republican Party presidential primaries McCloskey campaigned on a pro-peace/anti-Vietnam War platform and obtained 19.7 percent of the vote against incumbent President Richard M. Nixon in the New Hampshire primary. At the New Mexico Republican Party state convention Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr. cast a decisive vote that resulted in McCloskey being awarded a national convention delegate. Consequently, at the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, Rep. McCloskey received one vote (out of 1,348) from a New Mexico delegate; all other votes cast went to Nixon. In 2016, McCloskey published a tribute to Lujan titled &quot;An Honest Public Servant&quot;.

In January 1980, McCloskey was one of six members of an official bipartisan delegation of the House of Representatives appointed by Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill to visit Lebanon, Syria, and Israel. In Beirut the delegation met with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasir Arafat with a plan to conclude the trip with a meeting with Prime Minister Menachem Begin and other Israeli leaders in Jerusalem.

In June 1981, in a speech to retired United States military officers, McCloskey said: &quot;&#x27;We&#x27;ve got to overcome the tendency of the Jewish community in America to control the actions of Congress and force the President and the Congress not to be evenhanded&#x27; in the Middle East.&quot; In a press conference later the same day Mr. McCloskey criticized Menachem Begin for lobbying the Rev. Jerry Falwell for support for the June 7, 1981, Israeli airstrike on an unfinished Iraqi nuclear reactor and added, &quot;We have to respect the views of our Jewish citizens, but not be controlled by them.&quot; McCloskey later defended his remarks saying &quot;There is a strong Jewish lobby ... I do not understand why the Jewish community should resent it being labeled as such. They are a very effective lobby.&quot; However, he also predicted that criticism by B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith officials in California would harm his prospects of winning the 1982 Republican Senate primary there.

Shortly after Israel&#x27;s passage of the Golan Heights Law on December 14, 1981, McCloskey denounced the move as an &quot;aggressive and imperialistic action&quot; and urged his Congressional colleagues to block a $2.2 billion foreign aid package to Israel unless the action was rescinded. He said the &quot;annexation of the Golan Heights was another step which could eventually drag the U.S. into a nuclear war.&quot;

In 1982, McCloskey was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for nomination to the United States Senate. The California Republican Senatorial primary that year was a contentious battle among the major candidates in the 12-person GOP field, featuring mainly Reps. McCloskey, Bob Dornan, Barry Goldwater Jr. (son of Arizona Senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater), Maureen Reagan (daughter of then-President Ronald Reagan), San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, former Rep. John G. Schmitz, and Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce president Ted Bruinsma. Wilson was the eventual victor and went on to defeat the Democratic candidate, then-Governor Jerry Brown, in the general election.

According to Paul Findley, McCloskey was hounded by the Anti-Defamation League, both during his political career and when he retired to private practice as a lawyer, for his outspoken views on Israel&#x27;s attitude to Palestinians and on the Israel lobby.

===2006 run for Congress===

On January 23, 2006, McCloskey announced at a press conference in Lodi, California, that he would return to the political arena by running against seven-term incumbent Republican Richard Pombo in the Republican Party for California&#x27;s 11th congressional district. Earlier in the year, he formed a group called the &quot;Revolt of the Elders&quot; to recruit a viable primary candidate to run against Pombo. McCloskey&#x27;s aging campaign bus sported the slogan &quot;Restore Ethics to Congress.&quot; McCloskey said, &quot;Congressmen are like diapers. You need to change them often, and for the same reason.&quot; McCloskey was endorsed in the Republican Party primary by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In the June 6, 2006 primary, McCloskey was defeated by Pombo, receiving 32 percent of the vote.

On July 24, 2006, McCloskey endorsed Jerry McNerney, a Democrat who defeated Pombo in the 2006 midterm elections. McCloskey spent most of Election Night at McNerney&#x27;s victory party. The Sierra Club recognized McCloskey for helping to unseat Pombo with their 2006 Edgar Wayburn Award.

====IHR/Holocaust controversy====
During the 2006 primary campaign there was controversy over what McCloskey allegedly said about the Holocaust during his keynote address, titled &quot;The Machinations of the Anti-Defamation League&quot;, to the May 2000 Institute for Historical Review conference. According to the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, McCloskey said at the time, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether you are right or wrong about the Holocaust,&quot; and he referred to the &quot;so-called Holocaust&quot;. McCloskey replied &quot;that he has never questioned the existence of the Holocaust, and the 2000 quote referred to a debate over the number of people killed.&quot; McCloskey said in an interview with the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; on January 18, 2006, that the IHR transcript of his speech had been inaccurate.

Journalist Mark Hertsgaard of &quot;The Nation&quot;, in response to criticism of McCloskey following an article about the candidate&#x27;s 2006 campaign, stated that a videotape he had viewed of McCloskey&#x27;s speech to the IHR did not contain the &quot;right or wrong&quot; wording present in the transcript. According to Hertsgaard, McCloskey &quot;told the delegates, &#x27;I may not agree with you about everything I&#x27;ve heard today,&#x27; before he reiterated a core point of his speech—that the right for anyone to question what is said about the past is basic to freedom of thought in America.&quot; Hertsgaard also denied Rafael Medoff&#x27;s claim that McCloskey praised the &quot;&#x27;courage&#x27; of Holocaust deniers in Europe.&quot;

== Outside Congress==

===On Israel-Palestinian issues===
In 1984, McCloskey was invited to return to Stanford University as a visiting lecturer. The director of Hillel at Stanford characterized McCloskey&#x27;s appointment as &quot;a slap in the face of the Jewish community&quot;. Members of the student government also tried to pressure McCloskey to remove an article by former US diplomat George Ball from his course syllabus and &quot;add materials reflecting pro-AIPAC views.&quot; Following a &quot;faculty review&quot; McCloskey&#x27;s student opponents were censured for &quot; &#x27;serious abridgments&#x27; of academic freedom&quot; and Stanford&#x27;s Provost offered McCloskey a formal apology.

In 1986, McCloskey engaged in a debate about Israel-Palestinian issues with Jewish Defense League founder Rabbi Meir Kahane. According to a disputed transcript of an event fourteen years later, McCloskey stated that two thousand people attended the 1986 debate which took place in San Francisco. The event was eventually turned into a short film titled, &quot;Why Terrorism?&quot; produced by Mark Green.

McCloskey and former Rep. Paul Findley (R-Ill.) helped arrange a June 8, 1991, White House ceremony during which forty-two surviving crew members of the USS &quot;Liberty&quot;, an intelligence ship attacked by Israeli forces in 1967, were belatedly presented the Presidential Unit Citation awarded, but never presented, to the ship&#x27;s crew by President Johnson in 1968. The ceremony took place on the 24th anniversary of the incident, which killed thirty-four Americans, and was attended by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) expressed concerns about whether the event was held &quot;to give a stamp of approval to those seeking to malign Israel&quot;. The ADL singled out the participation of McCloskey and Findley as &quot;staunch critics of Israel&quot; and &quot;expressed concern with their involvement &#x27;and the sanction given by the White House of such rhetoric.&#x27; &quot; In 1982, McCloskey was approached by a former Israeli senior lead pilot who admitted that he had recognized the &quot;Liberty&quot; as an American naval vessel during the attack, but was told to ignore the U.S. flag and continue his attack. Upon refusing to do so and returning to base, he was arrested. McCloskey remained a committed supporter of the &quot;USS &quot;Liberty&quot; Veterans Association.&quot; He was planning to release a book in support of &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors titled &quot;The Most Infamous Order Ever Given: The Betrayal of the USS Liberty&quot;, which would have had many supporting documents in it.

===Pat Robertson presidential campaign controversy===
McCloskey contradicted Pat Robertson&#x27;s statements about Korean War service and so put an end to Robertson&#x27;s 1988 Presidential run. Robertson first claimed that he was a &quot;combat veteran&quot; back in 1981, which aroused the ire of McCloskey, who had been shipped to Korea along with Robertson as second lieutenants as part as the 5th Replacement Draft to bolster the First Marine Division, which had suffered great losses at the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir. McCloskey and Robertson were part of a contingent of 71 Marine officers and 1,900 enlisted men shipped to Korea aboard the USS &quot;General J. C. Breckinridge&quot; to serve as replacements.

When Robertson began claiming again that he was a combat veteran during the 1988 Republican primaries, McCloskey wrote a public letter to U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr., also a Marine veteran of the Korean War, in which McCloskey said that Robertson was actually spared combat duty when his powerful father, U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson of Virginia, intervened on his behalf, and that Robertson had actually boasted that his father would keep him out of combat. Robertson, a college friend, and four other second lieutenants were shipped to Japan, detailed to a training mission for Marines coming out of Korea. Of the remaining Marine officers, half were killed or wounded in combat.

Robertson sued McCloskey and another accuser for libel and demanded damages of $35 million, but research underwritten by McCloskey that cost him $400,000 proved that his revelations had been true. Rather than being a combat veteran, Robertson had been shipped to Japan right off the USS &quot;Breckinridge&quot;, then spent most of his time when returned to Korea posted at the safe harbor of the Division Headquarters. Robertson served as the Division &quot;&quot;, responsible for keeping the officers&#x27; clubs supplied with alcohol, which meant he kept traveling back to Japan. It was claimed that Robertson sexually harassed a Korean woman at one of his clubs and worried about getting gonorrhea. Documentary evidence uncovered by McCloskey revealed that his father, Senator Robertson, thanked Marine Commandant Robinson for getting his son out of combat. By the time of the libel trial, which was scheduled for Super Tuesday, many other Marine officers were prepared to testify that Robertson had avoided combat duty. The day before the trial, Robertson dropped the libel suit. On Super Tuesday, he was punished at the polls. He later paid McCloskey&#x27;s court costs.

McCloskey wrote a book about his Korean War experiences, &quot;The Taking of Hill 610&quot;.

===Council of the National Interest===
In 1989, McCloskey co-founded the Council for the National Interest along with former Congressman Paul Findley. It is a 501 (c)4 non-profit, non-partisan organization that works for &quot;Middle East policies that serve the American national interest.&quot; He taught political science at Santa Clara University in the early 1980s. For many years, he practiced law in Redwood City, California and resided in Woodside, California.

===Iraq War===
An opponent of the Iraq War, McCloskey broke party ranks in 2004 to endorse John Kerry in his bid to unseat George W. Bush as President of the United States.

==Change of political affiliation==
In the spring of 2007, McCloskey announced that he had changed his party affiliation to the Democratic Party. In an email and letter to the &quot;Tracy Press&quot;, McCloskey stressed that the &quot;new brand of Republicanism&quot; had finally led him to abandon the party that he had joined in 1948. He followed this up with an op-ed column in which he explained that &quot;Disagreement [with party leadership] turned into disgust&quot; and &quot;I finally concluded that it was fraud for me to remain a member of this modern Republican Party&quot;, although it was a &quot;decision not easily taken.&quot;

In the 2020 United States presidential election, McCloskey was nominated to be a member of the Democratic slate of electors for the state of California. As Democrat Joe Biden won the state&#x27;s popular vote, McCloskey became one of California&#x27;s 55 members of the Electoral College. He cast his presidential vote for Biden and vice-presidential vote for California Senator Kamala Harris on December 14, 2020.

==Political positions==
McCloskey favored abortion rights and supported stem cell research as well as Oregon&#x27;s assisted suicide law. He was a co-chair of the first Earth Day in 1970.

==Personal life and death==
McCloskey&#x27;s first marriage was to Caroline Wadsworth in 1949, and they had four children, Nancy, Peter, John, and Kathleen, before divorcing. He later married Helen V. Hooper.

On May 8, 2024, McCloskey died at his home in Winters, California, due to complications of kidney and congestive heart failure. He was 96.

<doc id="1090232" wikidata="Q681999" url="?curid=1090232" title="San Francisco de Macorís">
<text>San Francisco de Macorís is a city in the Dominican Republic located in the northeast portion of the island, in the Cibao region. It is the capital of the Duarte Province and the sixth most populated city in the country in 2010. The name &quot;San Francisco de Macorís&quot; comes from a combination of the name of Saint Francis, patron saint of the Franciscan Order (a religious organization from Italy that had come to this territory during colonization) and the territory&#x27;s old name, which is &quot;Macorix&quot;.

The city is known as the &quot;Land of Cacao&quot; (&quot;Tierra del Cacao&quot;). The area produces large quantities of organic cocoa, making the Dominican Republic the world&#x27;s 10th largest producer of cocoa beans.

==History==

A city was founded near San Francisco de Macorís in 1497. After La Vega was founded, Cotuí was later established in 1505 in a place rich in gold. For centuries what is now San Francisco de Macorís and the Duarte Province were rural outskirts of La Vega and Cotuí respectively. By the beginning of the 18th century, foreign investment from Europeans created a market for the production of cocoa, allowing the locals to gain a new source of income apart from livestock. It was the cocoa market that allowed the community around the Santa Ana monastery to become San Francisco de Macorís. However, it was not until the 1760s that the province gained a monopoly on the cocoa industry and managing to become a town for European travelers to stop by.

The Villa of Santa Ana of San Francisco de Macorís, also previously called Hato Grande, was named this until it was owned by Francisco Ravelo Polanco, Provincial Mayor of the Santa Hermandad of Santiago de los Caballeros, and tradition later points to Juan de Alvarado and the families Tejada and De Jesus as the owners of the land and donors of the territorial area for the purpose of its foundation in 1778.

In 1795, the Treaty of Basel was ratified, ceding to France the Spanish territory of Hispaniola. France took over the Spanish side in 1801, and under its administration San Francisco de Macorís became a parish with self-government. The official minutes of the city date back to 1811.

On October 2, 1896, Ulises Heureaux reorganized the city of San Francisco de Macorís under the Provincial District &quot;Pacificador&quot; (Peacemaker). At that time it was assigned as common to Cantonal Position of Matanzas, Section Monte Abajo, Villa Riva, Canton Castillo, among others.

District Pacificador&#x27;s name lasted until July 26, 1926, when the Dominican Congress changed its name to Duarte Province, presently used.

On 20 May 1963 the city council approved the renaming of the main streets of San Francisco de Macorís at the request of the Foundation Heroes of Constanza, Maimon and Estero Hondo.

== Geography ==

The city of San Francisco de Macorís is located in the North Region of the Dominican Republic (Cibao Region) between the Septentrional Mountain Range at the north and the Cibao Valley at the southern part. San Francisco de Macorís has hills to the north which provide a great view of the city during evening hours. The Jaya River is prominent on the western part of town.

=== Districts ===
The city has the following subdivisions:
=== Relief ===
The relief of Duarte Province ranges from above sea level, reaching its highest elevation at &quot;Loma Quita Espuela&quot;. This name allegedly comes from the time when the Spaniards were exploring the island, since the hill was too steep to ride their horses, they had to dismount and remove their spurs and undertake the ascent on foot. There are two main geologic regions: the north slope of the Cordillera Septentrional and the rough topography of the Delta del Yuna.

On the southern slope of the Cibao Valley in the Yuna Subregion (Easter Cibao), we will find alluvial fans, in combination with deposit hollows, hill areas and platforms, and also alluvial soils into the channels of the flows of the rivers Camú and Yuna.

Two faults go through the Duarte Province from east to west. This tectonic deformations are the Septentrional fault, that touches the towns of Arenoso, Castillo and San Francisco de Macorís and the Cibao fault passing through the towns of Las Guaranas, Castillo, Villa Riva Pimentel. The Septentrional fault is located in the northern part of the province while the Cibao fault is located in the southern part of it.

=== Geomorphology ===
The Yuna River Delta is part of the Cibao Valley, and most of these areas are located a few metres above sea level and therefore wetlands abound. Its main rivers are the Great Yuna and Caño Estero, which are the natural drainage of these lands in the province of Maria Trinidad Sanchez. The area consists mainly of swamps with silt and clay, and also large areas of peat deposits. By the rivers are alluvial deposits.

The Eastern Cibao Valley (also part of the Cibao Valle) is divided into the provinces of Santiago, Espaillat, Sánchez Ramírez, Sánchez and Duarte, the latter having a higher percentage (about 50%). All cities in this province are rooted in this valley except the city of Arenoso. The floodplains of the Yuna River system occupy a narrow strip on the south side of the valley and there is also a narrow chain of hills, probably middle Miocene limestones, adjacent to the north mountain range. For this province the valley also has marine lacustrine deposits of clay, basically of two kinds: a limestone and other non-calcareous.

The Haitises consist of a karst platform, which is composed of hard limestone from the Oligocene-Miocene. The highest elevations are generally tall. The Payabo River crosses the region by a narrow channel filled with alluvial deposits.

The Northern Range is a mountain range of sedimentary rocks and highly faulted and folded fobáceas. In this province the Northern Range reaches heights of (Quita Espuela); near San Francisco de Macorís the ridge height is slightly below . It presents some mudstone, limestone and Miocene and Eocene oligocénicos. To the south of Gaspar Hernandez and reaching the Nagua River there is a very complex area with rugged hills of limestone, and tuff, probably with other volcanic and metamorphic rocks, mainly of Upper Cretaceous.

=== Hydrography ===

There are many rivers and streams in the Duarte Province, the most important ones being the Camú River, the Yuna River and their tributaries (Jaya, Cuaba, Nigua, Payabo, among others). The Yuna River and Camú River constitute important sources of water, both for drinking and for irrigation.

=== Physiography and environment ===
Environmental pollution in Duarte Province is the product of several elements, such as the poor state of latrines, untreated sewage, overflow of streams, indiscriminate use of agrochemicals, backwaters and installation of pigsties on the banks of rivers, and waste from some factories in the province that is thrown into rivers.

Soil erosion from deforestation also affects the environment of the Duarte Province. Similarly, the smoke from factories and from burning trash, specifically in the municipality of San Francisco de Macorís, is affecting its inhabitants.

===Climate===
Temperatures fluctuate between , with cooler temperatures affected by rainfall. It is largely an isolated paradise since much of the territory is unaffected by hurricanes or extremely hot weather. Occasional floods can occur due to a rainy season which manifests itself mostly during the month of May.

==Places of interest==
*Estadio Julian Javier
*Casa del Morris Quezada
*Parque Duarte
*Catedral de Santa ana

== The municipal building ==
The city hall of San Francisco de Macorís is the headquarters of the city council and city mayor.

== Santa Ana Cathedral ==

The Santa Ana Cathedral is a mixture of Gothic and modern architecture. It covers a complete city block, bound on the north by Santa Ana Street, on the south by Colon Street, on the west by Papi Olivier Street and on the east by Restauracion Street. The Santa Ana Cathedral is the headquarters of &quot;Obispo de la Diócesis de San Francisco&quot; and home to the humanist &quot;Monseñor Jesús María de Jesús Moya.&quot;

== Communications ==

San Francisco de Macorís has several radio stations and publications. Its longest-running newspaper is &quot;El Jaya&quot;, which was founded on November 20, 1985. Its director and founder is the journalist Adriano Cruz Marte.

<doc id="1090236" wikidata="Q1969309" url="?curid=1090236" title="Cullen, Moray">
<text>Cullen () is a village and former royal burgh in Moray but historically in Banffshire, Scotland, on the North Sea coast. The village had a population of 1,327 in 2001. The organs of the wife of Robert the Bruce are said to have been buried in its old kirk after her death in Cullen Castle. Robert made an annual payment to the village in gratitude for the treatment of his wife&#x27;s body and its return south for burial. In 2000, the recent non-payment of this sum by the government was challenged and settled to the village&#x27;s favour.

==History==
Cullen has a long history, well-documented thanks to the survival of a number of sources. These are summarised in two key books: the &quot;Annals of Cullen&quot; by W Crammond (1904) and the &quot;Church Annals of Cullen&quot; by W Robertson (1938). The first deals primarily with the civil governance and the latter with church governance up to the disruption. Cullen received royal burgh status between 1153 and 1214 AD during the reigns of Malcolm IV and William I. It is also known to have received a charter in 1455 AD from James II. The burgh was abolished in 1975 by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.
Around 139–161, Ptolemy mentions in his &quot;Geography&quot; the River Celnius in the North East of Scotland. Both William Forbes Skene and George Chalmers identified the Celnius with Cullen Burn. The first mention of Cullen in Scottish history was in 962, when King Indulf was killed by the Norwegians (and/or Danes) at the mouth of the River Cullen and referred to as the Battle of the Bauds. &quot;Atween Coedlich and the sea, There lies Kings&#x27; sons three.&quot; Legend has it that within the vicinity, a Scots, a Danish and a Norwegian King are buried, marked by the three isolated rocks within Cullen Bay and named the &quot;Three Kings&quot;. However, it is possible that these rocks derive their name from the similarity of the name Cullen with Culane (Cologne) as in the medieval mystery play &quot;The Three Kings of Culane&quot;.

The church was founded as a chapel by King Robert the Bruce. The organs of Robert&#x27;s wife are said to have been buried in its old kirk after her death at Cullen Castle; the King then made an annual payment to the village in gratitude for the treatment of his wife&#x27;s body and its return south for burial. This payment was stopped after a 1975 reform of Scottish local government. In 2000, the non-payment of this sum was challenged and settled to the village&#x27;s favour.

Robert Burns stayed overnight at what was then the old town of Cullen in 1787 during his tour of the Highlands. Travelling from the west to the east he remarked that up to this point, &quot;the country is sadly poor and unimproved&quot;.

The old town of Cullen was demolished in 1822 and its remains are next to Cullen House. It was under James Ogilvy, 7th Earl of Findlater, that plans were first mooted for moving the town, but it was not until his successor Ludovick Ogilvy-Grant, 5th Earl of Seafield, that the plans were enacted. The town was moved away both to modernise (the houses of the old town flooded from water running down off the raised road when it rained heavily) and to provide the Earl with greater privacy. The new town was planned by George MacWilliam and built between 1820 and 1822.
The central market cross in the town square originally stood in the old town. During the building of the new town, it was temporarily erected at the top of the ancient fort structure that guards the entrance to the Cullen Burn, known as the Castle Hill. This resulted in the present layout of the village, a generous cross shape of two major streets, Seafield Street and Grant Street, with a central town square and &quot;the Seatown&quot; sandwiched on the false beach between the mouth of the burn and the harbour. In the previous layout, the town was spread along a road above and parallel to the burn, running between the Castle Hill and Cullen House, the Seatown being at the mouth of the burn where boats used to be pulled up onto the beach. The most prominent building in the new town is Cullen Town Hall, which was completed in 1823.

The fishing industry developed quickly in the 1880s, and the harbour was busy with large fishing boats, these giving way to steam drifters at the start of the 20th century. The industry became centralised on larger harbours, the boats became larger diesel-engined designs that required non-tidal access. The site of Cullen railway station was redeveloped after the station closed in 1968.

The main part of Cullen House dates from 1543. An east wing was added in 1711, and there were alterations by David Bryce in 1858. The House and estate buildings were converted into fourteen dwellings in 1983 by Kit Martin. Prior to the use of Cullen House by the Earls of Seafield, the castle of Findlater, now a ruin, on a rocky coastal outcrop approximately to the east, was the Earl&#x27;s seat.

==Attractions==

The village now has a population of 1,327. Cullen is noticeably busier in summer than winter due to the number of holiday homes owned. The village has a beach and golf course. The Bin Hill (or Bin of Cullen) is a nearby hill with an associated footpath.

<text>Scrooge is a 1970 musical film adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843). It was directed by Ronald Neame, and starred Albert Finney as Ebenezer Scrooge. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Leslie Bricusse and arranged and conducted by Ian Fraser.

The film was a follow-up to another Dickens musical adaptation, 1968&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Oliver!&quot;. Both films were shot by Oswald Morris and many of the sets at Shepperton Studios were reused for &quot;Scrooge&quot;. The posters for &quot;Scrooge&quot; included the tagline, &quot;What the dickens have they done to Scrooge?&quot;, designed to head off any criticism of an all-singing, all-dancing old skinflint. Finney won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy in 1971, and the film received four Academy Award nominations, including for Best Original Song (for &quot;Thank You Very Much&quot;).

== Plot ==

On Christmas Eve 1860, in London, stingy money-lender Ebenezer Scrooge declines his nephew Harry&#x27;s invitation for Christmas dinner and reluctantly gives his loyal employee Bob Cratchit Christmas Day off. As Scrooge leaves his office, he declines two gentlemen&#x27;s offer to collect money for charity. Returning home, Scrooge encounters the ghost of his seven-year-dead business partner Jacob Marley. It is revealed that, if Scrooge does not repent his miserly ways, he will be condemned in the afterlife as Marley was, carrying a heavy chain forged by his own selfishness and greed. Before leaving, Marley says that three spirits will visit Scrooge that night.

At one o&#x27;clock, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, who takes him back in time to Scrooge&#x27;s childhood and early adult life. They visit his lonely school days, where he is ultimately taken back home by his beloved sister, and then his time as an employee under Mr. Fezziwig. At a Christmas party held by Fezziwig, Scrooge falls in love with the former&#x27;s daughter, Isabel. Isabel eventually left Scrooge when he chose money over her. Scrooge asks the spirit to remove him and finds himself back in his bed.

At two o&#x27;clock, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present. Scrooge and the spirit visit Bob&#x27;s house to observe the family&#x27;s Christmas dinner. The spirit hints that Tiny Tim, Bob&#x27;s ill son, might die. They next visit Harry&#x27;s Christmas party, where he defends his uncle from his guests&#x27; snide remarks, hoping to know a better side to Scrooge. Before vanishing, the spirit returns Scrooge home.

At three o&#x27;clock, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who shows him the future Christmas 1861, with the citizens rejoicing at Scrooge&#x27;s death. At a cemetery, Bob mourns at Tim&#x27;s grave. A horrified Scrooge vows to change his ways as he falls through his own grave into the caverns of Hell. There, Marley shows him to his ice-bound &quot;office&quot;, where he will be &quot;the only man in Hell who&#x27;s chilly&quot; to serve as Lucifer&#x27;s personal clerk, just as Scrooge had forced Bob to work in a cold office. Scrooge is adorned with a large chain by four masked devils. He cries out for help, his shouts of &quot;help&quot; turning into &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;hellelujah&quot; as he starts losing his sanity, before he wakes up in his bedroom.

A gleeful Scrooge then repents. Finding that it is Christmas Day, he decides to bring happiness to London&#x27;s citizens and goes on a shopping spree, buying food and presents, with the help of children. He runs into Harry and his wife, giving them presents, and accepts their invitation to Christmas dinner. Dressed as &quot;Father Christmas&quot;, Scrooge then delivers a giant turkey, presents and toys to the Cratchits and promises to double Bob&#x27;s salary and that they will work to find the best doctors to make Tim better. Scrooge then frees his clients from their debts and promises to donate to charity. Scrooge returns home and starts preparing for dinner with his family.

A soundtrack album containing all of the songs from the film was issued on Columbia Records in 1970. The album peaked at No. 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Best Bets For Christmas album chart on December 19, 1970. Due to legal complications, however, the soundtrack has never been re-released in the CD format. The current Paramount Blu-ray release of the film has removed the Overture (which is intact on all VHS and DVD releases).

==Title sequence==
The film features an opening title sequence of numerous hand-painted backgrounds and overlays by British illustrator Ronald Searle. Art of the Title described it, saying, &quot;As is often the case with Searle’s illustrations, the forms jump and squiggle into shape, the strokes loose and sprightly. In each scene, swaths of colour and life pour out, white snowflakes dotting the brush strokes.&quot; The illustrations later appeared in the book &quot;Scrooge&quot; by Elaine Donaldson, published in 1970 by Cinema Center Films.

==Production==
Filmed in London and on location in Buckinghamshire between January and May 1970, the film sets at Shepperton Studios included fully reconstructed Victorian streets. Finney was in his mid-thirties and wore makeup to look older and was able to draw effectively upon his theatrical training and incorporate various vocal inflections and physical mannerisms as the old miser.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Scrooge&quot; opened on two screens in Los Angeles and Chicago, grossing $36,000 in its opening week. The release expanded two weeks later, including an opening at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and moved up to second place at the US box office behind &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot;. The following week it became number one but again fell to second place behind &quot;Lovers and Other Strangers&quot; for one week before returning to number one for two weeks before Christmas. In its sixth week at Radio City Music Hall it grossed $375,095 for the week, which &quot;Variety&quot; believed to be the biggest ever single week gross for a theatre worldwide surpassing the record set the previous Christmas by &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. Over the course of its initial theatrical release, the film earned $3 million in distributor rentals in the United States and Canada.

===Critical reception===
Gene Siskel of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising Finney&#x27;s &quot;masterful performance&quot;. Arthur D. Murphy, reviewing for &quot;Variety&quot;, called &quot;Scrooge&quot; &quot;a most delightful film in every way&quot; and praised Finney as &quot;remarkable&quot;, and also complimented Bricusse&#x27;s &quot;unobtrusive complementary music and lyrics; and Ronald Neame&#x27;s delicately controlled direction which conveys, but does not force, all the inherent warmth, humor and sentimentality.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; applauded &quot;Scrooge&quot; as a &quot;lovely movie, one of the few genuinely family-wide attractions of the whole year, calculated to please equally all those who have loved the Dickens work forever, and all those enviable youngsters who are about to discover it for the first time.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, feeling it &quot;works very nicely on its intended level and the kids sitting near me seemed to be having a good time.&quot; However, he was critical of Bricusse&#x27;s songs, writing that they &quot;fall so far below the level of good musical comedy that you wish Albert Finney would stop singing them, until you realize he isn&#x27;t really singing&quot;. He also criticises the depiction of Hell feeling it &quot;papier-mâché&quot;. Reviewing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Ann Guarino wrote &quot;Scrooge&quot; was &quot;bright with humor and moves along at a lively pace in 19th Century settings.&quot; She further praised the cast as &quot;excellent,&quot; but described Bricusse&#x27;s songs as being &quot;pleasant, but unfortunately forgettable with the exception of &#x27;Thank You Very Much&#x27;&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Finney&#x27;s performance &quot;absurd, sentimental, pretty, never quite as funny as it intends to be, but quite acceptable, if only as a seasonal ritual.&quot; He called the Hell sequence &quot;rather livid and supposedly comic&quot;. Overall, Canby felt the adaptation was &quot;surprisingly faithful&quot;, and he complemented Ronald Neame for directing &quot;the movie with all of the delicacy possible after a small story has been turned into a comparatively large, conventional musical. The settings—London streets and interiors, circa 1860 (updated from the original 1843)—are very attractive, somewhat spruced-up variations on the original John Leech illustrations.&quot;

Pauline Kael, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, found &quot;Scrooge&quot; to be an &quot;innocuous musical version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, starring Albert Finney looking glum. The Leslie Bricusse music is so forgettable that your mind flushes it away while you&#x27;re hearing it.&quot; Jay Cocks of &quot;Time&quot; magazine derided Finney&#x27;s performance as &quot;drastically disappointing. [He] grumbles and hobbles through his part, employing mannerism instead of nuance.&quot; Cocks was also critical of Bricusse&#x27;s songs, and summarized the film as &quot;a high-budget holiday spectacular, a musical extracted from Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; that turns out to be a curdled cup of holiday cheer [...] First frame to last, &quot;Scrooge&quot; is a mechanical movie made with indifference to every quality but the box office receipts.&quot;

Author Fred Guida called it one of the most underrated adaptions of the book.

In 2019, Robert Keeling of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; called &quot;Scrooge&quot; &quot;about average&quot;. Criticising the film&#x27;s decision to depict the ghosts in the way they are presented to be “a bit strange”. He felt the Hell sequence “really doesn’t work at all, and seems comically out of place for a Dickensian movie…frankly a bit much”. He called the Cratchit family “irritatingly chipper” though praised the use of cockneys playing the roles of this working class London family. However, Keeling praised Finney&#x27;s performance as the &quot;saving grace&quot; of the film.”

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for best original song score, and &quot;Thank You Very Much&quot; for best original song, though it failed to win in either category. It also received nominations, but no oscars, for art direction/set decoration and costume design. 
==Stage adaptation==
In 1992, a stage musical adapted from the film, featuring Bricusse&#x27;s songs and starring Anthony Newley, was mounted in the UK under the title &quot;&quot;. &quot;I Hate People&quot; was re-written as &quot;I Hate Christmas&quot;, and a cast recording was released.

The show was revived in 2003 on a tour of the UK by British song and dance man Tommy Steele, and he reprised the role at the London Palladium in 2004, making him the performer to have done the most shows at the Palladium. In 2007, Shane Ritchie played the part at the Manchester Palace. The musical was revived at London Palladium in October 2012 with Steele again playing the title role in a run that lasted until 5 January 2013.

The stage adaptation was mounted in Melbourne, Australia, in 1993, starring Keith Michell, Max Gillies, Tony Taylor, William Zappa, Dale Burridge, Emma Raciti, Ross Hannaford, Paul Cheyne, and Glenda Walsh.

==Animated version==
In 2022, following a limited theatrical release in the United States, an animated remake of the film, titled &quot;&quot;, was released by Netflix. Produced by Timeless Films (the team behind the &quot;Monster Family&quot; films) and written and directed by Stephen Donnelly, the remake incorporates many of Leslie Bricusse&#x27;s songs from the 1970 film, but has a newly-written book. The remake features the vocal talents of Luke Evans as Scrooge, Johnny Flynn as Bob Cratchit, Fra Fee as Harry, Giles Terera as Tom, Olivia Colman as the Ghost of Christmas Past, James Cosmo as Fezziwig, Jessie Buckley as Isabel, Trevor Dion Nicholas as the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Jonathan Pryce as Jacob Marley.

<doc id="1090242" wikidata="Q117471" url="?curid=1090242" title="Trevi nel Lazio">
<text>Trevi nel Lazio is a town and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the province of Frosinone in the Italian region of Lazio in the upper valley of the Aniene river.
It is by road northeast of Fiuggi and by road southeast of Subiaco, the nearest larger towns.

== History ==
The town first makes its appearance as Treba, a place of the Aequi, and later was called Treba Augusta to help distinguish it from Trebiae (Trevi in Umbria). The town was a bishopric from 499 to 1060; in the 15th century, it was sacked by Alfonso V of Aragon.

In August 2011 the Italian government had made plans to merge the village with neighbouring Filettino, in order to cut administrative costs, but they were interrupted by the protestations of the mayor of Filettino, Luca Sellari, who announced his village would become its own independent principality, in order to preserve its identity.

== Main sights ==
An old arch within the territory of the comune is said to be Roman, and some remains of the ancient acropolis have survived, but otherwise Trevi&#x27;s monuments are medieval or later:
* collegiate church of &quot;S. Maria Assunta&quot;
* oratory of &quot;S. Pietro &quot;(not dedicated to the apostle Peter, but to a local hermit)
* oratory of &quot;S. Maria del Riposo&quot;, with 15th‑century frescoes.

<doc id="1090244" wikidata="Q2981223" url="?curid=1090244" title="Tromino">
<text>A tromino or triomino is a polyomino of size 3, that is, a polygon in the plane made of three equal-sized squares connected edge-to-edge.

==Symmetry and enumeration==
When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there are only two different &quot;free&quot; trominoes: &quot;I&quot; and &quot;L&quot; (the &quot;L&quot; shape is also called &quot;V&quot;).

Since both free trominoes have reflection symmetry, they are also the only two &quot;one-sided&quot; trominoes (trominoes with reflections considered distinct). When rotations are also considered distinct, there are six &quot;fixed&quot; trominoes: two I and four L shapes. They can be obtained by rotating the above forms by 90°, 180° and 270°.

==Rep-tiling and Golomb&#x27;s tromino theorem==

Both types of tromino can be dissected into &quot;n&quot;2 smaller trominos of the same type, for any integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1. That is, they are rep-tiles. Continuing this dissection recursively leads to a tiling of the plane, which in many cases is an aperiodic tiling. In this context, the L-tromino is called a &quot;chair&quot;, and its tiling by recursive subdivision into four smaller L-trominos is called the chair tiling.

Motivated by the mutilated chessboard problem, Solomon W. Golomb used this tiling as the basis for what has become known as Golomb&#x27;s tromino theorem: if any square is removed from a 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; chessboard, the remaining board can be completely covered with L-trominoes. To prove this by mathematical induction, partition the board into a quarter-board of size 2&quot;n−1&quot; × 2&quot;n−1&quot; that contains the removed square, and a large tromino formed by the other three quarter-boards. The tromino can be recursively dissected into unit trominoes, and a dissection of the quarter-board with one square removed follows by the induction hypothesis.
In contrast, when a chessboard of this size has one square removed, it is not always possible to cover the remaining squares by I-trominoes.

<doc id="1090246" wikidata="Q2054507" url="?curid=1090246" title="Commandant">
<text>Commandant ( or ; ) is a title often given to the officer in charge of a military (or other uniformed service) training establishment or academy. This usage is common in English-speaking nations. In some countries it may be a military or police rank. It is also often used to refer to the commander of a military prison or prison camp (including concentration camps and prisoner of war camps).

== Bangladesh ==
In Bangladesh Armed Forces and Bangladesh Marine Academy commandant is not any rank. It is an appointment. The commandant serves as the head of any military or merchant navy training institutes or unit.

==Canada==
&quot;Commandant&quot; is the normal Canadian French-language term for the commanding officer of a mid-sized unit, such as a regiment or battalion, within the Canadian Forces. In smaller units, the commander is usually known in French as the &quot;officier commandant&quot;.

Conversely, in Canadian English, the word commandant is used exclusively for the commanding officers of military units that provide oversight and/or services to a resident population (such as a military school or college, a long-term health care facility or a detention facility.

==France==
In the French Army and French Air Force, the term &quot;commandant&quot; is used as a rank equivalent to major (NATO rank code OF-3). However, in the French Navy &quot;commandant&quot; is the style, but not the rank, of the senior officers, specifically &quot;capitaine de corvette&quot;, &quot;capitaine de frégate&quot; and &quot;capitaine de vaisseau&quot;.

==Germany==
In the German language, a military &quot;Kommandant&quot; is the commanding officer of a military installation (e.g. a fortress), vehicle, aircraft (the pilot is not always &quot;Kommandant&quot;, if another crew member has a higher rank) or vessel (e.g. U-Boot-Kommandant). In contrast to the governor, the fortress commandant of the Imperial German Army or the Wehrmacht never had higher but only lower jurisdiction. When subordinate to a governor, his duties were limited to garrison duty. Subordinate to him was the &quot;Platzmajor&quot;.

In the navy of the Bundeswehr, commandants, including former commandants, wear the special commandant badge. When the commandant is active, it is worn on the right side of the chest above the breast pocket. Former commandants wear it on the left breast under the name tag.

In Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol, the head of the volunteer fire brigade is called the &quot;Kommandant&quot;. As such, he leads the fire brigade and is responsible for the training and deployment of his local fire brigade. In his own local area, he leads the operations management of all fire brigades as long as this is not taken over by the higher-level operations management.

==India==

In the Indian Armed Forces, &#x27;Commandant&#x27; is not a rank but an appointment.
Commandant is the title of the heads of the Training establishments.
Examples include:
* Commandant of the National Defence Academy
* Commandant of the Indian Military Academy
* Commandant of the National Defence College
* Commandant of Indian Naval Academy

In the Indian Army, the Commanding Officer of an armoured regiment or a Mechanized infantry regiment (Mechanised Infantry Regiment, Brigade of The Guards) is known as the Commandant.

Commandant is a rank in the Central Armed Police Forces of India. It is equivalent to the rank of Colonel/Captain/Group Captain. In the Indian Coast Guard, ranks of Commandant and Commandant (Junior grade) exist. While Commandant is equivalent to Colonel/Captain/Group Captain, Commandant (Junior grade) is equivalent to Lieutenant Colonel/Commander/Wing Commander.

In the State Armed Police Forces, a Commandant serves as the head of an armed police battalion. The rank of Commandant is equivalent to that of a Superintendent of Police (SP).

==Ireland==

In the Irish Army, commandant (Comdt; ) is the equivalent of major in other armies. Irish Army commandants can sometimes be referred to as major if serving overseas under the umbrella of the United Nations or the European Union to alleviate misunderstanding.

==Kenya==
===Kenya Defence Forces===
In the Kenya Defence Forces Commandant is an appointment. Commandant is the title of the head of the training institutions . Examples include:

* Commandant of the Recruits Training School
* Commandant of the Kenya Military Academy 
* Commandant of the National Defence College
* Commandant of the Defence Staff College 
* Commandant of School of Infantry

===National Police Service===
In the National Police Service , the title of Commandant is reserved for commanders of large training institutions or commanders of large independent units. As with the Army, the post of a commander of a medium size unit is referred to as the Commanding Officer (CO) while the smallest is Officer Commanding (OC).

Example:

* Commandant of the General Service Unit (GSU)
* Commandant National Police College Embakasi A Campus 
* Commandant Rapid Deployment 
* Commandant Kenya Airports Police Unit

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, a Commandant is an appointment and not a rank but once selected, the appointee is promoted to the highest rank on the service. Commandants are appointed by the President of the Philippines either after the incumbent retires or as a replacement after dismissal.

There are currently two Commandant appointments that exist in the Philippines namely:

* Commandant of the Philippine Marine Corps; and
* Commandant of the Philippine Coast Guard

The Commandant of the Philippine Marine Corps will be promoted to the rank of Major General (Two-star Rank) once appointed while the Commandant of the Philippine Coast Guard will be promoted to the rank of an Admiral (Four-star Rank).

==South Africa==

In South Africa, &quot;Commandant&quot; was the title of the commanding officer of a commando (militia) unit in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

During the First World War, was used as a title by officers commanding Defence Rifle Association units, also known as commandos. The commandos were militia units raised in emergencies and constituted the third line of defence after the Permanent Force and the part-time Active Citizen Force regiments. The commandant rank was equivalent to major or lieutenant-colonel, depending on the size of the commando.

From 1950 to 1994 commandant (rank) was the rank equivalent of lieutenant colonel. and commander of a battalion. The rank was used by both the Army and the Air Force. The naval equivalent was commander (). The rank was not used by the South African Police, who continued with lieutenant colonel [luitenant-kolonel].

The rank insignia for a Commandant () was initially a crown over a five-pointed star. In 1957 the crown was replaced by a pentagonal castle device based on the floor plan of the Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town, South Africa&#x27;s oldest military building. In 1994, the rank of Commandant / Kommandant reverted to lieutenant colonel.

From 1968 to 1970, a related rank, , existed in the commando forces.

Recently, use of the term has followed the standard practice, i.e. the commanding officer of a training institute.

==New Zealand==
In the New Zealand Defence Force, the term commandant is used for the senior officer (or commander) of garrisoned units that do not deploy and are not operational. This typically includes learning institutes such as the New Zealand Defence College, the New Zealand Cadet Force, and (formerly) the Command and Staff College. The title could also be used for other non-deploying units such as the Services Corrective Establishment in Burnham, or depot-level engineering units.

The equivalent term for operational units is &#x27;commander&#x27;, such as commander of the Joint Force Headquarters New Zealand.

Under the 2010 creation of the Training and Education Directorate, an additional position of commandant was established for the Training Institute to complement the commandant of the Defence College.

==Russia==

In Russia and prior to that in the Soviet Union and Imperial Russia the position of commandant was widely used and may have various meanings:

*Palace commandant — a position in the Ministry of the Imperial Court, from March 14, 1896, the head of the governing body for the defense and protection of the imperial family.
*Fortress commandant — the commander of the fortress, and where there is none, the head of the city garrison, that is, the city commandant.
*City commandant— in Russia was in every city and in those villages where two or more separate military units or teams were located. To fill the commandant positions in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tsarskoye Selo, Gatchina, Petergof, Warsaw, Tiflis, Nikolaev and some other cities, special persons were appointed. In other cities, the duties of the commandant were assigned to district military commanders, and where there were none, to one of the officers of the local garrison. City commandants were subordinate to the chief commander of the military district and the head of the garrison.

*City garrison commandant — supervises the observance of discipline and order in the troops stationed in the city, guard duty and the detention of military personnel arrested for disciplinary offenses. In the Soviet Armed Forces and in the contemporary Russian Armed Forces, the commandant is the head of the military commandant&#x27;s office of the garrison — the main body for managing the garrison service. In small garrisons that do not have a regular military commandant&#x27;s office, a non-staff commandant is appointed by order of the garrison chief, usually the senior in position among the commanders of the commandant&#x27;s units of the military units stationed in the garrison.
*Military commandant of a railway station — an officer appointed to supervise the correctness and timeliness of the movement of military units (military echelons) and cargo, as well as the loading and unloading of military trains.
*Commandant of a border section — the head of a border commandant&#x27;s office — the head of a unit of a border detachment intended to protect a specific section of the state border. Responsible for:
**Protection of the designated section and operational work;
**Combat readiness, combat training, morale and psychological state and military discipline of the personnel of border outposts and other units of the commandant&#x27;s office;
**Condition and effective use of weapons and equipment, engineering structures and barriers in border protection;
**Implementation of activities for types of service and combat actions. When organizing the protection of the state border, ensures the implementation of the decision of the head of the border detachment and makes decisions in the event of a sharp change in the situation, and supervises subordinate border units. 
*Commandant of headquarters — a position established in wartime as part of the field headquarters of the Russian Imperial Army. Under his immediate control were the convoy with the gendarme unit or team and the wagon train of headquarters. Subordinate to him were sutlers, artisans, traders, industrialists, servants and all private individuals in general located in the area of the headquarters. He had the right to subject them to arrest for up to 1 month and a fine of up to 100 rubles.
*Corps commandant — was part of the corps administration according to the wartime staffing of the armed forces of the Russian Empire. His range of activities in the area of the corps headquarters generally coincided with the range of activities of the commandant of the headquarters.
*Stage commandant — was appointed in the army of the Russian Empire to manage each stage in wartime. In the area under his jurisdiction, the stage commandant was a representative of military authority and the immediate superior of all military teams and ranks located on stage for local guard, convoy and military police service. In areas occupied by right of war, until the establishment of special civil administration, all local administrative and police bodies were subordinate to him. He ordered the allocation of premises for passing units and commands, for hospitals, infirmaries and for all directorates and headquarters. The stage commandants had: an office, assistants and officers to perform the duties of commandant adjutants.
*Commandant of a city or locality in an occupied territory — a representative of the occupying military authorities.
*Commandant of a locality in which a state of emergency has been declared — responsible for ensuring the state of emergency, may impose a curfew.
*Commandants — district governors and commanders of local garrisons in the Russian Empire of the 18th century. Sometimes commandants were only district governors, especially before 1715; after that year, command of the garrison became the main and even exclusive responsibility of commandants: where there are no garrisons, there are no commandants, says the decree of 1715. The only exceptions were Ukrainian cities, for fear of enemy raids. As heads of garrisons, commandants were under the authority of the field marshal or governor. As district governors, commandants were completely dependent on governors, especially since 1712, when governors were given the right to choose commandants &quot;from among capable people&quot; and sometimes to chair the court over commandants. Chief commandants were appointed only in provinces, but not everywhere. Sometimes they replaced vice-governors and even governors in their absence. They were assisted by landrats, from 6 to 4, depending on the size of the province. Paul I, by a number of decrees dating back to 1797, increased the power and importance of commandants, giving them the right to address reports to him personally, and abolished the positions of chief commandants, as well as commandants in cities without garrison. In 1808, commandants were removed from the jurisdiction of governors and their duties were limited to garrison service. 
*Commandant — the head of the economic department and technical staff in some government and public institutions (hostels, theater buildings, etc.).

== Singapore ==
In the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), the position of Commandant is given to a Singapore Police Force officer who heads NPCC. The Commandant is aided by his Assistant Commandants, who are NPCC officers. As NPCC units around Singapore are divided into 20 &quot;areas&quot;, each area is headed by an Area Commandant who is an NPCC officer. This Area Commandant is also usually an Officer from one of the units in the area that he/she is taking charge of.

==Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, the Commandant of the Volunteer Force is the head of the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force. Commandant is also the title used for the commanding officer (one-star rank) of military academies - Sri Lanka Military Academy, Naval and Maritime Academy and Air Force Academy - and the commanding officer (two-star rank) of the Defence Services Command and Staff College. It is also the title of the de facto vice-chancellor of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, usually an officer of two-star rank.

Colonel-commandant is an honorary post in corps of the army and the Sri Lanka National Guard, similar to that of Colonel of the Regiment found in infantry regiments. The post of centre commandant is the commanding officer of a corps or regiment. Commandant is the head of the Special Task Force of the Sri Lanka Police.

==United Kingdom==
In the British Armed Forces, a commandant is usually the commanding officer of a training establishment, such as the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst or the Royal Air Force College Cranwell. In early 19th century England, the term commandant was used interchangeably with commandment - i.e., a person could act as a Commandment of the Justices - an officer-in-charge.

Colonel-commandant was an appointment which existed in the British Army between 1922 and 1928, and in the Royal Marines from 1755 to some time after World War II. It replaced brigadier-general in the army, and was itself replaced by brigadier in both the army and the Marines. The colonel-commandant is also the ceremonial head of some Army corps and this position is usually held by a senior general.

Commandant was also the appointment, equivalent to commodore, held by the director of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service between 1951 and 1993.

In the Army Cadet Force, a colonel is customarily the most senior commissioned officer in charge of an ACF county. This rank is thus known as the commandant and their second-in-command (2IC) is the deputy commandant, who has the rank of lieutenant colonel.

In the Royal Air Force Air Cadets, the officer in charge of the organisation is given the title Commandant Air Cadets and holds the position for two years.

Formerly, commandant was the usual title for the head of the Special Constabulary within a police force. In some forces, the title was chief commandant, with subordinate divisional or sub-divisional commandants. The standard title for this position is now chief officer.

In the Voluntary Aid Organisation in World War I, the chief officer of a military hospital or voluntary aid detachment (VAD), whether male or female, held the title of commandant.

==United States==
In the United States, &quot;commandant&quot; is an appointment, not a rank, and the following three appointments currently exist:
* Commandant of the Marine Corps
* Commandant of the Coast Guard
* Commandant of the Operations (Ships)

Formerly, admirals were appointed as commandants of naval districts.

The commandant is the second most senior officer (after the superintendent) of United States Service academies, such as United States Military Academy, United States Naval Academy, and the United States Air Force Academy, equivalent to the dean of students at a civilian college. Commandant is also the title of the commanding officer of many units of the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command, including the non-commissioned officer academies, whose commandants are typically command sergeants major.

Commandant is also the title of the ranking officer in charge of each War college of the United States military, and is responsible for the administration, academic progress and success of the civilians and military officers assigned to the college. The commandant is a model for all personnel, a military academy graduate of impeccable character and bearing who has demonstrated accomplishment in both academic excellence and active military service in the field. They include the Naval War College, the USAF Air War College, the Army War College, the Marine Corps War College and the National War College.

Commandant is the duty title for the commanding officer of the US Air Force Test Pilot School.

Commandant is also the duty title of the senior enlisted leader of a Professional Military Education (PME) academy, such as the Airman Leadership School, Non-Commissioned Officer Academy, and Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Academy.

The title may also be used for the commander of a unit headquarters, who is usually responsible for administrative matters such as billeting and is called the headquarters commandant; this may also be a duty assigned to a staff officer in large headquarters.

<doc id="1090251" wikidata="Q7450074" url="?curid=1090251" title="Senatorial courtesy">
<text>Senatorial courtesy is a long-standing, unwritten, unofficial, and nonbinding constitutional convention in the U.S. describing the tendency of U.S. senators to support a Senate colleague opposing the appointment to federal office of a nominee from that senator&#x27;s state. The practice is motivated by a general sense of collegiality among senators and the assumption that a Senate colleague will have the best first-hand knowledge of the personal character and qualifications of a nominee from the senator&#x27;s own state. It is also viewed as an &quot;important source of political patronage&quot; for U.S. senators.

==Procedure==
This custom generally affords each senator some role in the process of nomination and confirmation of federal office holders, conditional on a matching political party affiliation between the president and the senator. Where each is of the same political party, the president will consult the senator prior to submitting a nomination for any federal posting geographically tied to that senator&#x27;s state. Such consultation can help the president avoid a politically costly and embarrassing rejection of the nominee.

This consultation can be one of soliciting the senator for recommendations regarding whom the president should nominate, whereby the senator can reward political supporters from their state who are qualified for the position, or of quietly seeking the senator&#x27;s advance approval or rejection of a nominee the president already has in mind for the vacancy prior to making that nomination. As United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy described the practice, &quot;Basically, it&#x27;s senatorial appointment with the advice and consent of the president.&quot;

While not afforded the advisory role given to senators of the president&#x27;s party, the blue slip policy of the Senate Judiciary Committee guarantees that even senators of the opposition party receive at least a consultative role regarding appointments of federal district and appellate court judges, U.S. attorneys, and federal marshals whose jurisdictions are geographically tied to the senator&#x27;s state.

==History==
The precedent that developed into senatorial courtesy began with the nomination by President George Washington of Benjamin Fishbourn to the post of naval officer for the port of Savannah, Georgia. Given the infancy of the U.S. federal government and the need to populate the executive offices, the Senate had previously given prompt consent to the president&#x27;s nominations. But when the Senate debated Fishbourn&#x27;s nomination, both senators from Georgia objected, with Senator James Gunn rising to speak against the nomination—likely because of his own personal animosities toward the nominee. Consequently, the Senate deferred to the Senator from Georgia and rejected the nomination.

Senatorial courtesy generally does not apply in the appointment of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. However, that has not prevented some U.S. senators from using the custom to successfully block Supreme Court nominees from their state. During the second administration of President Grover Cleveland, the death of Associate Justice Samuel Blatchford ignited a political fight between Cleveland and Senator David B. Hill of New York. Cleveland nominated in turn William B. Hornblower and Wheeler Hazard Peckham to fill the vacancy, only to have Hill block each nominee—both Hornblower and Peckham had previously opposed Hill&#x27;s political machine in New York. In addition to the custom, the Senate afforded Hill great deference since the vacant bench seat had been held by appointees from New York since the Jefferson administration. Cleveland then leveraged a separate Senate custom—the custom of &quot;all but automatic approval of senatorial colleagues&quot;—to sidestep Hill&#x27;s opposition by nominating Edward Douglass White, then an incumbent U.S. senator from Louisiana.

<text>Trespass to chattels, also called trespass to personalty or trespass to personal property, is a tort whereby the infringing party has intentionally (or, in Australia, negligently) interfered with another person&#x27;s lawful possession of a chattel (movable personal property). The interference can be any physical contact with the chattel in a quantifiable way, or any dispossession of the chattel (whether by taking it, destroying it, or barring the owner&#x27;s access to it). As opposed to the greater wrong of conversion, trespass to chattels is argued to be actionable &quot;per se&quot;.

The origin of the concept comes from the original writ of trespass &quot;de bonis asportatis&quot;. As in most other forms of trespass, remedy can only be obtained once it is proven that there was direct interference regardless of damage being done, and the infringing party has failed to disprove either negligence or intent.

In some common-law countries, such as the United States and Canada, a remedy for trespass to chattels can only be obtained if the direct interference was sufficiently substantial to amount to dispossession, or alternatively where there had been an injury proximately related to the chattel. (See Restatement (Second) of Torts, 1965.)

==United States law==
The Restatement of Torts, Second § 217 defines trespass to chattels as &quot;intentionally… dispossessing another of the chattel, or using or intermeddling with a chattel in the possession of another.&quot; Harm to personal property or diminution of its quality, condition or value as a result of a defendant&#x27;s use can also result in liability under § 218(b) of the Restatement. 

Certain specific circumstances may lend themselves to liability for the action. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 218 states further that:

One who commits a trespass to a chattel is subject to liability to the possessor of the chattel if, but only if,
The trespass to chattels cause of action, frequently asserted in recent years against Internet advertisers and email spammers, is often included in complaints against spyware companies. These electronic messaging cases, and their progeny, which have cropped up over the last decade, will typically turn on the situations described in (b) or (d), and, as detailed below, the question of harm caused is a big issue.

In sum, the basic elements of a claim of trespass to chattels are: 1) the lack of the plaintiff&#x27;s consent to the trespass, 2) interference or intermeddling with possessory interest, and 3) the intentionality of the defendant&#x27;s actions. Actual damage is not necessarily a required element of a trespass to chattels claim.

==Features of the claim==

; Lack of consent
:A vendor can attempt to dispute a trespass claim on the grounds that the user consented to the terms of the contract. Even if consent was given for certain access, a user may still have a valid trespass to chattels complaint if the vendor has exceeded the contractual terms, if the contract is found to misrepresent the actual functioning of the product, or if the consent has been withdrawn. A vendor can be held liable for &quot;any use exceeding the consent&quot; given.

; Actual harm
: The precise criteria for ascertaining actual harm varies among states. In California, for instance, an electronic message can be deemed a trespass where the message interferes with the target computer&#x27;s operation, as long as a plaintiff can demonstrate either actual hardware damage or actual impaired functioning. But the general concept of requiring impaired computer functioning has been adopted consistently and in showing impaired computer functioning, courts have usually emphasized system unavailability.

; Intent
: In clarifying the meaning of intent in the context of a trespass to chattels claim, The Second Restatement of Torts states that &quot;intention is present when an act is done for the purpose of using or otherwise intermeddling with a chattel or with knowledge that such an intermeddling will, to a substantial certainty, result from the act,&quot; and that, furthermore, &quot;[i]t is not necessary that the actor should know or have reason to know that such intermeddling is a violation of the possessory rights of another.&quot;

Damages from a trespass claim are limited to the actual harm sustained by the plaintiff (which can include economic loss consequent on the trespass - e.g. loss of profit on a damaged chattel). In cases of dispossession, the plaintiff is always entitled to damages if they can prove the dispossession occurred, even if no quantifiable harm can be proven.

A related tort is conversion, which involves an exercise of control over another&#x27;s chattel justifying restitution of the chattel&#x27;s full value. Some actions constitute trespass and conversion; in these cases, a plaintiff must choose which claim to make based on what amount of damages they seek to recover.

== In the electronic age ==
The common law tort of trespass to chattels has been invoked in the modern context of electronic communications to combat the proliferation of unsolicited bulk email, commonly known as spam. In addition, several companies have successfully used the tort to block certain people, usually competitors, from accessing their servers. Though courts initially endorsed a broad application of this legal theory in the electronic context, more recently other jurists have narrowed its scope. As trespass to chattels is extended further to computer networks, some fear that plaintiffs are using this cause of action to quash fair competition and to deter the exercise of free speech; consequently, critics call for the limitation of the tort to instances where the plaintiff can demonstrate actual damages.

=== Rules ===
The trespass to chattels tort punishes anyone who substantially interferes with the use of another&#x27;s personal property, or chattels. Plaintiffs must show that the offender had intentional physical contact with the chattel and that the contact caused some substantial interference or damage. The courts that imported this common law doctrine into the digital world reasoned that electrical signals traveling across networks and through proprietary servers may constitute the contact necessary to support a trespass claim. Applying this common law action to computer networks, plaintiffs must first prove that they received some type of electronic communication (typically bulk e-mail or spam) that the defendant intentionally sent to interfere with the plaintiff&#x27;s interest in his or her property and second that this communication caused a quantifiable harm to their tangible property, such as impaired functioning of the computer, network or server.

=== Early applications of trespass to chattels to computer networks ===

In the late 1990s, when the World Wide Web was in its infancy, courts were more receptive to extending the trespass to chattels tort to the electronic context. In &quot;CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.&quot;, a 1997 case that was the first to extend the trespass theory to computer networks, a federal district court held that a marketing company&#x27;s mass mailing of a high volume of unsolicited advertisement emails to CompuServe subscribers constituted an actionable trespass to chattels. CompuServe customers repeatedly received unwanted advertisements from Cyber Promotions, a company that specialized in sending marketing email in bulk. Cyber Promotions also modified its equipment and falsified other information to circumvent CompuServe&#x27;s anti-spam measures. Due to the high volume of email, CompuServe claimed damage to its servers as well as money lost dealing with customer complaints and dissatisfaction. CompuServe also extended its damages claim to its subscribers who spent time deleting unwanted email. The court held that Cyber Promotions&#x27;s intentional use of CompuServe&#x27;s proprietary server was an actionable trespass to chattels and granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the spammer from sending unsolicited advertisements to any email address maintained by CompuServe. Cyber Promotions&#x27; persistence in sending email to CompuServe&#x27;s servers after receiving notification that CompuServe no longer consented to the use weighed heavily in favor of a finding of trespass. 

A trio of 1998 cases in the Eastern District of Virginia involving America Online more firmly established the use of the trespass to chattels tort as a spam-fighting tool. In &quot;America Online, Inc. v. IMS&quot;, the court held that the owner of a marketing company committed trespass to chattels against an Internet service provider&#x27;s (ISP) computer network by sending 60 million unauthorized email advertisements to the ISP&#x27;s subscribers after being notified that the spam was unauthorized. The court found that the defendant, intentionally and without authorization, caused contact with the plaintiff&#x27;s computer network by sending the bulk email messages. Such contact injured the plaintiff&#x27;s business goodwill and diminished the functioning of its computer network. 

Similarly, in &quot;America Online, Inc. v. LCGM, Inc.&quot;, a company engaging in pornographic website advertising sent a deluge of spam to AOL&#x27;s customers, and, in so doing, also forged the AOL domain name in an effort to trick customers into opening the emails. The court once again held that a website operators&#x27; transmission of unsolicited bulk emails to customers of an ISP, using the provider&#x27;s computers and computer network, constituted trespass to chattels. 

In &quot;America Online, Inc. v. Prime Data Systems, Inc.&quot;, the defendants sent millions of spam emails to AOL subscribers advertising computer software programs designed to facilitate bulk emailing by allowing users to harvest email addresses from the plaintiff&#x27;s member directories, chat rooms, and electronic bulletin boards. The defendants also used technology designed to avoid AOL&#x27;s spam filtering mechanisms. The defendants frequently used false and deceptive &quot;headers&quot; in email messages to make it appear as if AOL had sent the messages. The increased demand on AOL&#x27;s servers resulting from the spam caused substantial delays of up to 24 hours in the delivery of all email to AOL members, forcing AOL to temporarily stop accepting any new messages. As the spam problem grew worse, AOL had to purchase millions of dollars worth of additional equipment to increase the capacity of its servers to handle the volume of email. The court held that this activity constituted a trespass to chattels and awarded injunctive relief, reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees and costs, as well as damages.

=== Beyond spam: screen scraping and data harvesting ===
Since the early spam cases, courts have extended the electronic trespass to chattels theory even further to encompass screen-scraping and other data &quot;harvesting.&quot; Screen-scraping is the practice of taking information from another website, generally through the use of search agent software, and &quot;harvesting&quot; the data for one&#x27;s own commercial use. For example, travel websites frequently use this tactic to offer a host of options and prices gleaned from various airlines&#x27; sites. Because the courts have entertained such litigation, some companies have specifically banned the conduct in their terms and conditions statements.

In &quot;eBay v. Bidder&#x27;s Edge&quot; (2000), eBay successfully used the trespass to chattels tort to prevent Bidder&#x27;s Edge from employing spiders to cull information about its auctions to display on its own website. Although Bidder&#x27;s Edge&#x27;s robots only consumed a small percentage of eBay&#x27;s computer resources, the court noted that the plaintiff need not demonstrate current substantial interference as conduct which constituted a use of another&#x27;s property is enough to sustain a trespass to chattels claim. In light of this, the court found that eBay had demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of future injury to warrant granting a permanent injunction: &quot;If the court were to hold otherwise, it would likely encourage other auction aggregators to crawl the eBay site, potentially to the point of denying effective access to eBay&#x27;s customers.&quot;

&quot;Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc.&quot; (2000) is a further example of this temporary trend in which plaintiffs did not have to demonstrate any real interference. Register.com, a domain name registry service, sued competitor Verio for using Register.com&#x27;s proprietary WHOIS look-up service to find potential leads among its customer base. The court found that, by continuing to access Register.com&#x27;s online customer database after being told to stop, Verio was trespassing on Register.com&#x27;s WHOIS server. Register.com had specifically withdrawn its consent to Verio&#x27;s use of search robots to review Register.com&#x27;s customer list. The court held that Verio caused harm to Register.com&#x27;s files through the use of these search robots and that the searches improperly taxed Register.com&#x27;s server capacity. 

These holdings gave the court license to expand the applicability of trespass to chattels to computer networks even further. In &quot;Oyster Software v. Forms Processing&quot; (2001), the Northern District of California determined that a plaintiff need not demonstrate any physical interference with a server at all to sustain a trespass to chattels claim and consequently denied the defendant&#x27;s motion for summary judgment, even though there was no evidence of damage to the plaintiff&#x27;s computer system. Although Oyster conceded that there was no evidence that the defendant&#x27;s activities had interfered in any way with the functioning of Oyster&#x27;s computer system, the court nonetheless denied FPI&#x27;s motion for summary judgment. According to the court, following the decision in &quot;eBay&quot;, plaintiffs only need to demonstrate that the defendant&#x27;s actions &quot;amounted to a &#x27;use&#x27; of Plaintiff&#x27;s computer,&quot; and the court determined that copying the metatags amounted to a use.

These cases indicate that, at least in California, a plaintiff did not have to demonstrate any kind of actual interference with the computer system to successfully claim trespass to chattels.

=== The backlash against the tort&#x27;s expansion ===

However, some courts subsequently limited tort claims for electronic trespasses, in that a complaining party may be unable to recover for lack of real harm if the party did not suffer any tangible damage to their property. 

The Supreme Court of California reversed the trend exemplified by &quot;Oyster&quot; in the seminal case &quot;Intel Corp. v. Hamidi&quot; (2003), reaffirming the need for a demonstration either of actual interference with the physical functionality of the computer system or of the likelihood that this would happen in the future. Although Intel conceded that Hamidi&#x27;s emails caused neither physical damage nor any disruption to their computer system, they alleged that the economic productivity lost due to the disruption caused by the emails could sustain a trespass claim. The Supreme Court of California disagreed, holding that the tort does not extend to claims in which the electronic communication involved &quot;neither damages the recipient computer system nor impairs its function.&quot; In reaching this conclusion, the court criticized the understanding of &quot;eBay&quot; advanced in &quot;Oyster&quot;, explaining that previous cases in which courts have found trespass to chattels in the electronic setting have involved either &quot;actual or threatened interference with the computers&#x27; function.&quot; To that effect, the court in &quot;Oyster&quot; misconstrued the holding in &quot;eBay&quot;; trespass requires more than use a use--it requires an actual or threatened interference with the physical functionality of the system. 

Although the vast majority of states have yet to determine the applicability of the trespass to chattels theory, the courts that have addressed the issue have applied &quot;Intel&quot; and required that the plaintiff demonstrate damage to the computer system. A supreme court in New York in &quot;School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz&quot; denied the defendant&#x27;s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the trespass to chattels claim because the plaintiff had alleged actual damage to the functionality of the computer system, which Intel requires; the defendant had sent enough e-mails that it reduced the computer system&#x27;s functionality and drained the hard drive&#x27;s memory. The Fourth Circuit in &quot;Omega World Travel, Inc. v. Mummagraphics, Inc.&quot; also followed &quot;Intel&quot;, although this resulted in granting a motion for summary judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff did not allege any actual damage on its computer system. The court clarified that Oklahoma courts have yet to recognize the validity of a trespass to chattels claim based on an electronic intrusion to a computer system, but if it were to recognize it, the plaintiff would need to allege more than nominal damages, which in this case it had not.

=== Cautions on expanding the tort in the electronic context ===

Although a number of commentators have expressed enthusiasm over the increasing &quot;propertization&quot; of intellectual property (that is to say, the increased application of real property doctrines to intangible property) and the extension of the trespass to chattels doctrine to computer networks, a number of detractors have expressed concern over the ramifications of extending the theory to protect electronic communications that do not actually damage the computer systems in question but only cause nominal damage due to their content. Primarily, these critics worry that extending trespass to chattels in this fashion would stifle free speech on the internet because any unwelcome email might constitute a trespass and may subject the sender not only to civil liability under the trespass theory but to criminal liability as well. This would presumably reduce people&#x27;s willingness to communicate freely on the Internet and curtail the Internet&#x27;s ability to function as an open, democratic forum. Particularly in situations where the electronic communication is an email that contains speech that is of importance to the public and the communications do not hamper the functionality of the recipient&#x27;s computer system, First Amendment free speech protections ought to outweigh the property right in the unharmed computer system. Similarly, critics have also expressed concerns that plaintiffs have employed the doctrine to stifle legitimate competition. For example, the screen-scraping cases indicate that courts might interpret trespass to chattels in such a way that allows major corporations to prevent price comparison sites from employing harmless bots to aggregate information that users want in a readily accessible format since it might encourage consumers to look elsewhere.

Critics of the theory&#x27;s extension to computer networks also note greater theoretical problems with the applicability of a real property theory to intellectual property. In order to explain why real property theories might extend to the Internet, proponents equate &quot;cyberspace&quot; with real land, arguing that owners of computer servers should have the same right of inviolability as owners of land receive to promote greater efficiency in transactions. However, even if some aspects of cyberspace resemble real space, detractors contend that cyberspace is not like real land at all because &quot;the &#x27;placeness&#x27; of cyberspace is a matter of ongoing social construction.&quot; Furthermore, even if granting property rights might help to avoid problems of inefficiency and under-cultivation in the context of real property, critics note that nothing suggests that the same principles would also be effective in the context of computer networks—especially because the problem of under-cultivation does not tend to occur online.

<doc id="1090257" wikidata="Q1011670" url="?curid=1090257" title="Dalbeattie">
<text>Dalbeattie (, , meaning &#x27;haugh of the birch&#x27;, or &#x27;drowned haugh&#x27; (i.e. liable to flood) is a town in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. Dalbeattie is in a wooded valley on the Urr Water east of Castle Douglas and south west of Dumfries. 

The town is famed for its granite industry and for being the home town of William McMaster Murdoch, the First Officer of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Dalbeattie is a Gaelic name, recorded in 1469 as &quot;Dalbaty&quot;. The first element of the name is Gaelic &quot;dail&quot; &#x27;water-meadow, haugh&#x27;. There are two possible interpretations for the second element. The most common is Gaelic &quot;beithich&quot;, genitive singular of &quot;beitheach&quot; &#x27;abounding in or relating to birch trees&#x27;, derived from &quot;beith&quot; &#x27;birch&#x27;. Dalbeattie would thus mean &#x27;haugh of the birch&#x27;. The second interpretation takes -&quot;beattie&quot; to be &quot;bhàite&quot; (from &quot;bàite&quot;) &#x27;drowned&#x27;, meaning &#x27;liable to flooding&#x27;. W. J. Watson offers this derivation for Dalbate in Middleby.

Dalbeattie is popularly interpreted as &#x27;birch valley&#x27; or &#x27;birch vale&#x27;, which is adopted in the names of local businesses such as Birch Valley Dental Clinic and Birchvale Theatre. The interpretation of the first element as &#x27;vale&#x27; or &#x27;valley&#x27; may be due to confusion with the word &quot;dale&quot;. The association with &#x27;valley&#x27; goes back to at least 1955, when the &quot;Third Statistical Account&quot; records that the &#x27;accepted derivation&#x27; is Celtic, meaning &#x27;the valley of the birches&#x27;.

==History==

The formal beginnings of Dalbeattie originate in 1781 when George Maxwell of Munches and Alexander Copeland of Kingsgrange (or Colliston) decided to encourage the development of the town by feuing their property. The Maxwells owned the land on the north side of the burn and the Copelands owned the land on the south side. They also established a soup kitchen for local workers.

The building of the bridge over the River Urr at Craignair in 1797 and the rapid expansion of the granite industry in Dalbeattie attracted more people to settle in the town.

==Governance==
The town is under the management of Dumfries and Galloway council and is located in the Abbey ward. The town is in the Westminster constituency of Dumfries and Galloway and currently represent by Alister Jack. In the Scottish Parliament the town is within the Galloway and Upper Nithsdale constituency and the South of Scotland region and was represented by Alex Fergusson.

==Geography==
Dalbeattie is situated in the Urr valley of which most of the east side is covered by forest. The River Urr flows from the north southwards to the Solway Firth and passes by the west side of the town. The town has an abundance of distinctive grey granite.

==Economy and landmarks==


Formerly granite quarrying was an important part of the Dalbeattie economy. The most prominent of which is the characteristic Craignair quarry which is clearly visible to the west of the town. Dalbeattie Granite works was established in 1820 and was situated in Craignair Street, following a direct route from Craignair quarry.

Many of the workers emigrated to other parts of the world in order to find work, a number emigrated to the United States to work at a sister quarry in Westerly, Rhode Island. Granite exported from Dalbeattie went into the Mersey Docks in Liverpool, the Thames Embankment in London, various British lighthouses, even as far as the lighthouse at the southern tip of Ceylon (Sri Lanka).

* The war memorial in Colliston Park was unveiled in September 1921, attended by Mr William Duncan. It commemorates those that died in World War I and, with additions, those that died in World War II. The memorial is a simplified version of the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh made of Dalbeattie granite, topped with the lion rampant of Galloway by Pilkington Jackson. The designers were W S Macgeorge and E.A. Hornel.
* The fountain on the junction of Mill Street and High Street was built in 1887 by D.H. &amp; J. Newall to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.
* The single arch Buittle Bridge, or Craignair Bridge, that crosses the Urr Water is a Category A Listed building. It was completed in 1797 and replaced an earlier 2-arch bridge upstream which was destroyed by flooding shortly after it was built. The bridge is notable for having an unusually wide span for a single arch construction.
* Dalbeattie Town Hall was completed in 1862.
* Cardoness Castle of the McCullochs, a 15th century Scottish nobleman&#x27;s home. The castle harbours a prison pit as well a tower.
* Cairn Holy Chambered Cairns, it has been described as the resting place of a mythological Scottish king. The tomb dates to the 4th milineum BC. Cairn II is considered to be the burial place of Scottish king Galdus.
* Orchardton tower, a circular tower from the 15th century. It is a free standing tower and it&#x27;s only kind in Scotland.

==Transport==
The town is accessible by roads from Dumfries, Castle Douglas, and is on the Solway coastal road. A regular bus service based in Dumfries travels through Dalbeattie and Castle Douglas to the west of the region and back. The town also acts as a minor hub for bus routes across the Solway coast. The town previously had access to the rail network; however, Dalbeattie railway station was removed in the 1960s as the line was deemed unprofitable.

== Museums and galleries ==
Dalbeattie has a museum devoted to the history of the town and surrounding area. There is also a small art gallery, the Nail Factory, which hosts temporary exhibitions, usually of work by local artists.

<doc id="1090259" wikidata="Q2978998" url="?curid=1090259" title="Cleveland Metroparks Zoo">
<text>The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is a zoo in Cleveland, Ohio. The Zoo is divided into several areas: Australian Adventure; African Savanna; Northern Wilderness Trek, The Primate, Cat &amp; Aquatics Building, Waterfowl Lake, The RainForest, Asian Highlands, and the newly added Susie&#x27;s Bear Hollow. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has one of the largest collections of primates in North America, The Zoo is a part of the Cleveland Metroparks system.

The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (CMZ) was founded in 1882. It is one of the most popular year-round attractions in Northeast Ohio with an attendance of 1.32 million in 2023.

== History ==

The Zoo, originally named the Cleveland Zoological Park, first opened in 1882 at Wade Park where the Cleveland Museum of Art now stands. During its early years, the Zoo only held animals of local origin. In 1907, the city of Cleveland moved the Zoo to its current location in Old Brooklyn, and the Zoo acquired its first elephant. The park was informally known (and referred to) as Brookside Zoo for many years. Beginning in 1910, the Zoo constructed Monkey Island, sea lion pools, and a moated bear exhibit. By 1940, the Zoo was home to three elephants and its first (permanent) elephant resident since 1924. That same year, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History assumed control of the Zoo.

Between 1955 and the transfer of management to the Cleveland Metroparks in 1975, the Zoo experienced rapid expansion despite setbacks due to flooding: the Zoo&#x27;s reptile collection and several other buildings were lost when Big Creek overflowed in January 1959. Although the Zoo had recovered by 1962, it would not have another permanent reptile collection until the opening of the RainForest thirty years later. Ostrich races proved popular in 1965 and 1966 and a large public swimming pool sat on the grounds from 1930 until the 1960s.

Construction began on the Primate &amp; Cat Building in 1975 (the Aquatics section would be added in 1985), later followed by the RainForest in 1992, Wolf Wilderness in 1997, Australian Adventure in 2000, and the Sarah Allison Steffee Center for Zoological Medicine in 2004. Newer exhibits include the Asian highlands and Tiger Passage opened in 2017 and 2018, and The Rhino Reserve was completed in 2020.

The Zoo&#x27;s official website states that it currently has 3,000 animal residents representing more than 600 different species.

=== Emeritus directors and staff ===
====Goss: 7th director====
Dr. Leonard Goss, DVM, PhD (1913–1999) was a veterinary pathologist and retired from the Cleveland Zoo (later renamed the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo) as its director in 1979. Prior to assuming the director position in Cleveland, he was the fourth chief veterinarian at the New York Zoological Society&#x27;s Bronx Zoo as well as assistant director of the Bronx Zoo. Goss was President of the AZA and twice vice-president.

At the Bronx Zoo, which is the headquarters for the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Goss conducted clinical, epidemiological and pathological research in collaboration with eminent field zoologist George Schaller. Schaller was the Director of the Bronx Zoo&#x27;s Animal Research and Conservation Center, which is now referred to as the Wildlife Conservation Society&#x27;s Global Conservation Program.

The Cleveland Zoo has since made efforts to replicate this type of collaborative research relationship as demonstrated by Drs. Goss and Schaller in the 1970s and more recently by Atlanta, Chicago (Lincoln Park &amp; Brookfield), National, San Diego, and Saint Louis zoos.

In the mid and late 1990s General Curator Hugh Quinn hired Patricia McDaniels as the first of three successive curators for the CMZ&#x27;s Science and Conservation section. The unit now has a veterinary epidemiologist on staff. Sharon Deem, DVM, PhD Dipl. ACZM (now with the Saint Louis Zoo), was the first formally trained epidemiologist on staff and was both a researcher and experienced clinician from the National Zoo.

When Goss, a graduate of the Cornell University and The Ohio State University veterinary colleges returned to Ohio to assume the role as director of the Cleveland Zoo, he continued to conduct research in zoological medicine and related animal science disciplines. Goss was a president of the board of directors of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (previously the &quot;American Zoo and Aquarium Association&quot;, and originally the &quot;American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums&quot;).

====Vitantonio: 8th director====
Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Vitantonio was hired as the eighth director of the Cleveland Zoo in its 130 plus year history.

====Taylor: 9th director====
Inspired by the TV show Zoorama, zoo director-emeritus Steve H. Taylor, B.S. began his zoo career in 1972 as an animal keeper at the Los Angeles Zoo. According to his website, he is now a &quot;Zoo Consultant and Entertaining Speaker&quot;. Taylor continues to advise zoos, including the Akron Zoo as both a professional consultant and member of its board of trustees. He also served on the board of directors of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Prior to moving to Ohio, Taylor was the director of the 5-hectare Sacramento Zoo.

Taylor resigned as director of the zoo in Sacramento to accept the directorship of the zoo in Cleveland. In his memoirs, published in a newsletter, Taylor described the CMZ to be poorly managed and &quot;undistinguished&quot; when he assumed the position as its 9th director. He credits himself for improving the conditions for both animals and staff over his 24-year career in Cleveland.

====Emeritus staff recognition====
The National Zoo Association awarded Cleveland Metroparks&#x27; Zoo staff with Honorary Memberships. Retired CMZ administrators and career zoo and aquarium professionals Daniel Moreno and Donald Kuenzer were recognized as &quot;Honorary Membership&quot; Winners by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Recipients of Honorary Membership are recognized as the most esteemed and distinguished zoo professionals in North America. According to the AZA website, &quot;Honorary Membership&quot; is conferred by the AZA Board of Directors upon those AZA members who have made &quot;significant contributions to the zoological profession during their careers.&quot;

Moreno and Kuenzer are included in a list of other notable North American zoo and aquarium professionals. Other recipients include William G. Conway, Hon. PhD (Director General/President Emeritus, Bronx Zoo-based Wildlife Conservation Society), Lester Fisher, DVM (Veterinarian/Director Emeritus, Lincoln Park Zoo), Murray Fowler, DVM (Veterinarian/Professor, University of California), Jack Hanna, Hon.

Clarke (Director Emeritus, Topeka Zoo), Roger Conant, Hon ScD (Curator Emeritus, Toledo Zoo) and Ted A. Beattie (President/Director Emeritus, Shedd Aquarium).

=====Daniel Moreno=====
Dan Moreno joined the CMZ after serving three decades at the helm of the Cleveland Aquarium as both its director and curator under the auspices of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. The Cleveland Aquarium&#x27;s animal collection was &quot;absorbed&quot; by the CMZ in 1986 after structural elements of the aquarium building forced its closing.

Until his retirement in 1997, Moreno managed the aquatic animal collections at the Cleveland Zoo under General Curator Don Kuenzer. He supervised animal husbandry programs for the Rainforest and Aquatics exhibits. Moreno was a charter member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (originally the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums) and served on its board of directors from 1971 to 1976.

In 2012, the Greater Cleveland Aquarium opened to the public as the only free standing aquarium in the state of Ohio.

=====Donald Kuenzer=====
Don Kuenzer retired after a 40-year career serving in multiple capacities, including senior curator, general curator and acting director. In 1961, Kuenzer began his career at the Cleveland Zoo&#x27;s Petting Farm as an attendant animal care technician. After serving as an animal keeper, he was promoted to Assistant General Curator in 1975 by zoo director Dr. Leonard Goss.

Kuenzer was credited with designing The Rainforest, a state-of-the art indoor naturalistic living exhibit dedicated to the display of tropical and subtropical species from multiple continents. He served on the Board of Regents for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

== Exhibits ==

The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (CMZ) is divided into several bio-thematic areas that house animals from different regions of the world. Each area is themed for the particular region of the world they represent, although the older areas (such as the Primate, Cat &amp; Aquatics Building) are less thematic than those that were constructed more recently. Upon entering, visitors arrive in the Welcome Plaza which features administrative buildings, an amphitheater, food court, and the Zoo&#x27;s largest souvenir shop. Numerous smaller concession/souvenir stands are located throughout the park.

Aside from walking, Zoo patrons may opt to ride the &quot;ZooTram&quot; line which shuttles visitors between the Welcome Plaza (near African Elephant Crossing) and the Primate, Cat &amp; Aquatics Building.

=== The RainForest ===
The RainForest, opened in 1992, is one of the most popular exhibits at the CMZ. It is contained in a large, two-story building with over of floor space, making it one of the largest indoor tropical environments in the world. The RainForest boasts more than 10,000 plants, and over 600 animals, from the tropical regions of Australasia, Africa, and the Americas. The opening of the RainForest also introduced the Metroparks Zoo&#x27;s first permanent reptile collection since the flooding in 1959. The RainForest&#x27;s herpetile collection includes Amazon milk frogs and tree boas, Baron&#x27;s green racers, Burmese pythons, climbing toads, dwarf crocodiles, Fiji banded iguanas, green-and-black, blue-and-black and &#x27;Mint Terribilis&#x27; poison dart frogs, green tree monitors and pythons, harlequin frogs, Indian gharial, Indochinese box turtles, Madagascar leaf-tailed geckos, magnificent tree frogs, spider tortoise, Panamanian golden frogs, prehensile-tailed skinks, the aquatic tentacled snake, tiger ratsnakes, tomato frogs and Yemeni veiled chameleons.

The RainForest is housed in a large glass and granite building, just outside the main entrance to the Zoo. The structure is divided into an outer ring—featuring an assortment of tropical plants, exhibits containing small mammals, a cafeteria, and a gift shop—and an inner area that contains the principal animal exhibits. Animal habitats are located on both floors of the RainForest. The exhibits contained on the ground floor are collectively known as the &quot;Lower Forest&quot;, and those on the second floor are known as the &quot;Upper Forest&quot;.

Upon entering the RainForest, visitors are immediately greeted by a cascading, waterfall and a rush of hot, humid air, as the entire complex is heated year-round to an ambient 80 °F (27 °C). All around the waterfall is a lush, tropical garden of epiphyte and lithophyte plants, growing vertically, rooted to the different trees and rock wall; botanical species here include various types of bromeliads, aroids, and orchids. The entire garden display grows steadily towards the sun, soaring upwards of two stories. The walls behind the waterfall resemble Ancient Mayan temple ruins; as visitors walk around the water feature, exhibited creatively within the walls are a series of (geographically appropriate) diminutive New World monkeys, including the pied tamarin, Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin, white-headed marmoset and the endangered golden lion tamarin.

The outer ring of The RainForest is home to a wide variety of tropical plants including lancepods, ficus, dracaena, philodendron, prayer plants, clusia (or balsam apple), Indian-almond, bixa/achiote (or lipstick trees), numerous varieties of orchids, a kapok tree (Malvaceae family), and the annual-blooming titan arum (corpse flower). The central &quot;Tropical Rain Storm&quot; exhibit is a life-like recreation of a rainforest &quot;island&quot;, with a large tree in the center, surrounded almost entirely by a moat stocked with tinfoil barb and pangasius catfish. The island itself is inhabited by several Cape porcupine. Several times daily (seasonally-dependent), a simulated tropical thunderstorm occurs; darkened ambience, flashing &quot;lightning&quot; and rumbling thunder sound effects signal the several-minutes-long event&#x27;s commencement. Above the moat and encircling the island, a vertical &quot;wall&quot; of water provides visitors a glimpse of a tropical downpour, with water streaming down into the river below. After the &quot;storm&quot; passes, a sense of tranquility is created as fog fills the entire exhibit.

The core animals of The Rainforest are the Bornean orangutans, of which the zoo has five: males Tiram and Zaki, and females Kera Wak, Kayla, and Merah. Zaki is the most recent orangutan baby at the zoo, born in 2021 to Tiram and Kera Wak.

Animals contained in the RainForest include the binturong, red-rumped agouti, a large group of free-flying straw-coloured fruit bats and Rodrigues flying foxes, the giant anteater, a group of capybara, scarlet ibis, the prehensile-tailed Brazilian porcupine, white-faced whistling ducks, green aracari, Prevost&#x27;s squirrel, leafcutter ants, ocelot, clouded leopard, Luzon bleeding-heart pigeons, roseate spoonbill, yellow-spotted river turtles, Asian small-clawed otter, François&#x27; langur, and fishing cats. Additionally, visitors will encounter numerous smaller, &quot;discovery&quot;-type exhibits featuring tropical invertebrates, Australian rainbowfish, upside-down catfish, jewel cichlids, red-bellied piranha, small mammals, and many reptiles and amphibians.

In 2024, CMZ announced that it will permanently close the RainForest on September 9, 2024. The area will be remodeled and expanded to create a new, 140,000 square foot &quot;Primate Forest&quot; that will serve as a multi-story habitat for gorillas and orangutans. The new Primate Forest, which zoo officials described as a &quot;world-class indoor destination,&quot; is scheduled to open in 2026.

=== African Savanna ===
The African Savanna area is located near the park entrance. Visitors can observe African lions, flamingos, giraffes, zebras, bontebok, a variety of African birds, and eastern black rhinos. the African elephant crossing contains elephants and meerkats. On February 7, 2018, a baby rhino, named Lulu, was born to parents Forrest and Kibbibi. On August 20 of the same year, another baby rhino, named Nia, was born to parents Forrest and Inge.

====The Sarah Allison Steffee Center for Zoological Medicine====

As part of CMZ&#x27;s focus on conservation, the Zoo constructed the Steffee Center for Zoological Medicine in September 2004. The center hosts medical, laboratory and surgical suites, in addition to a ward and quarantine area. Its veterinary hospital is equipped with the first CT scanner for use in a zoo hospital. Located in a nearby pavilion is the Reinberger Learning Lab, where Zoo patrons can learn about veterinary care at every stage of an animal&#x27;s life. The Learning Lab offers interactive, hands-on educational displays as well as views into surgical suites where visitors may observe treatment procedures in progress.

====African Savanna and Ben Gogolick Giraffe Encounter====

Consisting of several large yards, the African Savanna features a variety of mammals and birds. The exhibit houses animals such as Masai giraffes, Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebras, bonteboks, ostriches, white-backed vultures as well as several species of African storks and geese. In 2015, the Ben Gogolick Giraffe Encounter was completed, and visitors are now able to purchase leaves to feed the giraffes.

====African Elephant Crossing====

In 2011, the Zoo opened its new elephant exhibit, African Elephant Crossing. At a total cost of $25 million, the state of the art habitat quadrupled the elephants&#x27; living space, allowing the zoo to increase its number of African elephants from three, to a herd of eight to ten. The exhibit features two large ranges—the Savanna and the Mopani—spread out over several acres. The ranges include deep ponds so that the elephants can swim, as well as expanded sleeping quarters. Areas of the ranges are also heated to maximize the elephants&#x27; habitat during the winter months. Periodically throughout the day, the elephants are shepherded across the pathway between the ranges, allowing visitors an up-close view of the animals. In addition to expanding the number of African elephants, the African Elephant Crossing exhibit introduced Meerkats, naked mole rats, an African rock python, and several species of birds.

=== Australian Adventure ===
The Australian Adventure area is an exhibit designed to resemble the Australian outback. It is home to wallaroos, kangaroos, emus and wallabies that roam freely throughout Wallaby Walkabout. Dingoes are also housed in this area along with two aviaries. During the summer, one contains a kea, and the other has cockatoo and kookaburras. Zoo patrons can learn how sheep are sheared at Kookaburra Station, and experience up-close encounters with Southdown sheep, goats, Alpacas and other farm animals in the adjoining Contact Yard. The Australian Adventure is also home to a Yagga Tree, which contains animal exhibits and a snake slide for younger visitors. Due to Northeast Ohio&#x27;s inclement winters, Australian Adventure is weather dependent in the colder months.

====Gum Leaf Hideout====

Located in Koala Junction, Gum Leaf Hideout is home to the zoo&#x27;s collection of koalas and Matschie&#x27;s tree-kangaroos. The exhibit also features interactive displays that teach visitors about the devastating effects of deforestation on Australian ecosystems.

====Reinberger Homestead====

Modeled after a traditional 19th-century sheep station, the Reinberger Homestead offers Zoo visitors a look into Australian home life. The area contains animatronics of a koala and kookaburra, who speak about the culture.

====Wallaby Walkabout and Boomerang Railway====

Designed to replicate the Australian outback, Wallaby Walkabout features winding paths that visitors share with kangaroos, Red-necked wallabies, and Common wallaroos during the months of April through October. The landscape includes vegetation intended to be consumed by the animals. Families can also take a train ride through the exhibit. In July 2007, the Zoo fell under scrutiny from PETA after a one-year-old kangaroo was struck and killed by the exhibit&#x27;s &quot;Boomerang Railway&quot; train. In response, the Zoo quickly dismissed the employee who was operating the train and installed a fence along the tracks to prevent future injuries from happening.

====Yagga Tree====

The artificial, 55 foot tall Baobab known as the Yagga Tree is the star of Australian Adventure. It once contained exhibits for small animals, as well as another animatronic, this time a crocodile named Wooly Bill.

=== Wilderness Trek ===
The Wilderness Trek area is home to cold climate animals such as Siberian tigers, grizzly bears, Tufted deer, Reindeer, the near threatened American Bison, and Red-crowned cranes which remain active outdoors year-round. The California sea lion/harbor seal exhibits feature large pools for visitors to observe the animals at play. The Metroparks Zoo also contains one of the largest collections of bear species in North America, including grizzly bears, Andean bears, Malayan sun bears, North American black bears, and sloth bears. On January 14, 2019, a female sloth bear named Shive gave birth to a female cub named Shala. Shala was the first sloth bear cub born at the zoo in 30 years.

====Wolf Wilderness====

Wolf Wilderness gives visitors a comprehensive look into the environment and wildlife of a northern temperate forest. Wolf Lodge, which anchors the exhibit, serves as an education and viewing center for gray wolves, beavers, and a variety of wetland species. Wolf Wilderness is one of the principal North American habitats at the CMZ. The exhibit opened in 1997 and consists of the Wolf Lodge, a large woodland enclosure for the wolves, a 65,000-gallon pond, and panoramic viewing rooms.

Visitors access the exhibit through the Wolf Lodge, a building that is modeled after a 19th-century fur trading post. Upon entering, visitors arrive in the welcome center, which offers information on the indigenous animals of North America&#x27;s deciduous forests and wetlands; this room leads into the two main exhibit areas.

The first exhibit room is dedicated to the six Mexican gray wolves contained in a vast, wooded area directly behind the Wolf Lodge. Zoo patrons are able to observe the wolves through a large viewing room with floor-to-ceiling windows, which look out into the habitat. Surveillance cameras within the enclosure are linked to monitors in the viewing room, allowing visitors to see the wolves even when they are out of direct view.

The viewing room leads into the second exhibit area—the wetlands and wolf display room. Here, visitors can observe both the wolves and several other North American animals through floor-to-ceiling windows, similar to the viewing room. Although visitors can also view the wolves from this room, the principal exhibits are the Canadian beaver habitat, the freshwater pond, and the Zoo&#x27;s collection of bald eagles. The Canadian beaver habitat features an artificial beaver dam with cross-sectional windows that grant visitors a chance to view the beavers&#x27; nest within. The freshwater pond is adjacent to the viewing windows, thereby creating an aquarium effect that allows visitors to see what a wetland pond looks like beneath the water&#x27;s surface. The pond contains numerous fish indigenous to the North American wetlands.

====Rosebrough Tiger Passage====

Opened June 3, 2016, this exhibit features &quot;four separate, interconnected habitat areas for the [zoo&#x27;s] Amur tigers to roam&quot;, and includes &quot;two overhead elevated pathways&quot;.

====Asian Highlands====

Asian Highlands opened June 12, 2018. This exhibit features expanded habitats for snow leopards, Amur leopards, and red pandas, and also includes Sichuan takins. on April 22, 2018, three snow leopard cubs were born.

==== Susie&#x27;s Bear Hollow ====
Opening on August 23, 2023. This exhibit features the zoo&#x27;s pair of sloth bears and spectacled bear. The exhibit replaced outdated enclosures built in the 60s with modern habitats for the zoo&#x27;s tropical bears.

=== Primate, Cat &amp; Aquatics ===
 Opened originally as the Primate &amp; Cat Building in 1975, the Primate, Cat &amp; Aquatics Building houses one of the largest collections of primate species in North America, including western lowland gorillas, Müller&#x27;s gibbons, Allen&#x27;s swamp monkeys, Golden-bellied mangabeys (one of only twelve zoos currently displaying them), Black howler, White-faced sakis, Bolivian gray titis, Ring-tailed lemurs, Red ruffed lemur, Mongoose lemurs and Crowned lemurs. Also next to the Gorillas is a nocturnal section containing Aye-ayes, Mohol bushbabies, and Pygmy slow lorises. Non primate species in the primate section include Fossas and Northern treeshrews. However, the building does not display the zoo&#x27;s entire primate collection with some primates featured in the Rainforest and African Savanna.

In 1985, the Cleveland Aquarium permanently closed and donated its collection of exotic fishes and invertebrates to the Metroparks Zoo. A section of the Primate &amp; Cat building was renovated to accommodate the new Aquatics section, which currently features 35 salt- and freshwater exhibits include Australian lungfishes, a giant Pacific octopus, electric eels, and hundreds of living coral.

The Primate, Cat &amp; Aquatics Building has also featured outdoor exhibits such as the outdoor section of the gorilla and golden bellied mangabey exhibits. The zoo&#x27;s slowest resident, the Aldabra giant tortoise, can be found in the enclosure directly across from its fastest resident, the cheetah. Several of the tortoises are over one-hundred years old.

=== Waterfowl Lake ===
The marshy shallows of Waterfowl Lake are home to Chilean flamingos, Black swan, Canvasback ducks, and trumpeter swans. During the summer months, Müller&#x27;s gibbons and lemurs populate the lake&#x27;s islands, and use ropes suspended above the water to navigate between them. Visitors can observe predatory birds such as Andean condors and Steller&#x27;s sea eagles in-flight within towering, outdoor flight cages on the lake&#x27;s eastern shore. The nearby Public Greenhouse contains hundreds of tropical plant species in addition to a seasonal butterfly exhibit. Waterfowl Lake is also the site of Wade Hall, one of the oldest zoo buildings in North America. Today, the hall serves as a Victorian ice cream parlor for Pierre&#x27;s Ice Cream Company.

==Recognition==
The CMZ is one of five city zoos in Ohio. The &#x27;Buckeye State&#x27; has been referred to as a &quot;Zoo State&quot;, as only California rivals Ohio in the sheer number of options zoogoers have for visiting reputable zoos.

A 2014 &quot;Top Ten&quot; ranking of the nation&#x27;s zoos by &quot;USA Today&quot; (based on data provided by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums) recognized the CMZ for being nominated for the &quot;USA Today&quot; award. Three other Ohio zoos were nominated and won awards for the &#x27;Best US Zoo&#x27; contest: the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and the Toledo Zoo.

==Notable animals==

=== Balto ===

Balto, an Alaskan husky and sled dog made famous for his role leading the last stage of the 1925 serum run to Nome, resided at the zoo from March 1927 until his death in March 1933. Balto, along with six surviving teammates from the serum run, were purchased from a traveling circus owner in Los Angeles by the citizenry of Cleveland following a ten-day fundraising campaign. Following his death, Balto&#x27;s remains were mounted by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, which continues to exhibit him to this day. Statues of Balto and Togo, another dog credited for heroic feats on the serum run, were unveiled at the zoo in 1997.

===Timmy (Gorilla)===
Arguably the most famous animal resident in the Cleveland Metropark Zoo&#x27;s history, Timmy the Western lowland gorilla attained greater fame as a very prolific sire at the Bronx Zoo. Although he was known as the &quot;dud stud&quot; at the Cleveland zoo, he proved to be quite virile after he arrived at the Bronx Zoo on loan. Timmy was managed indoors in human care for 25 years before being sent on breeding loan to the Wildlife Conservation Society&#x27;s main campus and headquarters at the Bronx Zoo. The move was highly controversial. The consideration of separating Timmy from his companion Kate, was met with much protest by animal rights activists and was the subject of a federal court case. CMZ Director Emeritus Steve H. Taylor cites the lawsuit surrounding the breeding loan as one of the most significant in the history of modern zoos.

Timmy went on to sire more than 13 offspring in New York, many of whom were conceived in the Bronx Zoo&#x27;s state-of-the-art Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit, which opened after his arrival in New York City.

Timmy&#x27;s offspring Okpara was born to Pattycake at the Bronx Zoo. Okpara returned to Cleveland before moving on to another facility.

===Blackie===
On January 13, 2014, the CMZ&#x27;s Nile hippopotamus &quot;Blackie&quot;, was euthanized at approximately 60 years of age. He formerly lived at the Pachyderm Building from 1955 until 2008. For the remaining years of his life, he lived at the zoo&#x27;s private Africa barn in a two-room enclosure. Blackie may have been the longest-lived male Nile hippopotamus ever recorded in human care in North America. As far as hippos go, he had a gentle demeanor and weighed approximately 3700 lbs.

===Aldabra Tortoises===
The Zoo cares for three tortoises, including a pair of animals both exceeding 100 years of age.

==Services and special events==
===Education and outreach===
Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (CMZ) hosts day and overnight camps for children ages 5 to 14 during the summer months. The Summer Day Camp program teaches children about conservation and encourages understanding of the natural world. Overnight opportunities include stays in the Australian Adventure&#x27;s Reinberger Homestead; stays in the Wolf Lodge, where guests can use the same tracking technology utilized by field scientists; and the African-themed &quot;Rising Waters Safari Camp&quot;. Campers at Rising Waters stay in the zoo&#x27;s African Savanna for an authentic safari experience complete with animal encounters. Each overnight program combines elements of Australian, Native American and African culture with an overarching theme of conservation.

Other educational opportunities include the Zoo&#x27;s &quot;Keeper for a Day&quot; program, which is open to middle school, high school, and college students who are interested in a career working with animals. Similar to a job shadowing program, program participants spend a day working with animal professionals in the Zoo&#x27;s Conservation Education Division. Participants are tasked with preparing meals, cleaning enclosures, conducting training exercises, and providing animals with enrichment items to stimulate them both mentally and physically.

The CMZ is a part of Miami University&#x27;s graduate-level Advanced Inquiry Program (AIP). The program offers a Master of Arts in Biology or Master of Arts in Teaching through online coursework and face-to-face experiential learning experiences at the zoo.

===Conservation support===
The zoo also offers numerous grant opportunities which fund research and conservation projects around the world. In 2011, the zoo and Zoological Society awarded grants to more than 90 field conservation projects and programs in 39 countries. Some of these projects include elephant conservation in southern Africa, studying gorilla ecology and behavior in central Africa, and anti-poaching initiatives for Asiatic freshwater turtles. Over the past ten years, the CMZ has supported more than 600 conservation projects in nearly 100 countries. Current initiatives include &quot;Quarters for Conservation&quot; and spreading awareness of the burgeoning Palm Oil Crisis in Malaysia and Indonesia.

===Events===
====Boo at the Zoo====

CMZ&#x27;s annual fall event, &quot;Boo at the Zoo&quot;, takes place in October. Visitors can observe the various cold weather animals that still roam outside, and are encouraged to wear costumes to the park. The Boo at the Zoo event is a safe Halloween option that offers animal shows, live performances, and other fall-related activities.

====DINOSAURS!====
During the summer months, the Zoo features prehistoric animals along the wooded path around Waterfowl Lake. Younger visitors have the opportunity to dig for &quot;fossils&quot; and learn about the field of paleontology. The 2007 and 2010 &quot;DINOSAURS!&quot; exhibits showcased dinosaurs from around the world: &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot;, &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, &quot;Omeisaurus&quot;, &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Styracosaurus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, Suchomimus and more. The 2013 &quot;DINOSAURS!&quot; exhibit featured 20 animatronic dinosaurs, including &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and &quot;Troodon&quot;.

===Venue hire===
In Spring 2015, the CMZ opened a new reception event center, Stillwater Place. Offering scenic views of nearby Waterfowl Lake and a capacity of up to 300 guests, Stillwater Place is open year-round and caters to many occasions, such as weddings, birthdays, reunions and more.

==Incidents==
In 1938, Judy Zemnick, a young artist with the Works Progress Administration (WPA), was pulled into an enclosure by a polar bear named &quot;Silver&quot; and &quot;badly mangled,&quot; according to news reports. Two other WPA artists, James C. Kulhanek and Clarence Zuelch, witnessed the attack, called for help, and attempted to drive the bear away from Ms. Zemnick. Zoo visitors were known to throw things, including broken glass, at &quot;Silver&quot; for several years in retaliation for the incident with Ms. Zemnick. In October 1940, an anonymous &quot;10-year-old girl&quot; sent $2.00 (&quot;her savings&quot;) to the zoo &quot;protesting the throwing of bottles and stones at the bear.&quot; She specified one dollar was to be given to the zoo staff members who &quot;are good to animals&quot; with the other donated for &quot;a new place for the zoo.&quot;

In 2015, Mitchelle Schwab was charged after allegedly dropping her 2-year-old son into a cheetah exhibit. His parents were finally able to retrieve him from the exhibit and was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center.

<text>Mark Anthony &quot;Gator&quot; Rogowski (born August 10, 1966) is an American former professional skateboarder who was convicted of murder. He was mainly prominent in the 1980s and early 1990s. Rogowski&#x27;s career ended when he pled guilty for assaulting, raping, and murdering Jessica Bergsten in 1991. His life was chronicled in a critically acclaimed 2003 documentary titled &quot;&quot; by American filmmaker Helen Stickler.

==Early years==
Rogowski was born in Brooklyn, New York, but he moved to Escondido, California, at the age of three after his parents divorced. Rogowski was a gifted athlete, playing little league baseball in his youth. Rogowski started to skateboard at age seven and, while most of his friends were into surfing, he eventually started to hang out at skate parks several years later. In 1978 after 2 years of skating local parks, 12 year old Rogowski was picked up by a local skate team.

==Rise to prominence==
Rogowski started his professional skateboarding career in 1980 at age 14. In 1982, he won his first major contest, the Canadian Amateur Skateboarding Championships in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1984, he won a national championship. Rogowski soon received endorsement deals from Gullwing Trucks and G&amp;S early in his career. He was the first skateboarder to receive his own &#x27;pro-deck&#x27; by Vision Sports, and his pro-deck proved popular and was soon followed by the Mark Gonzales and Tom Groholski models. Rogowski was soon featured on the cover of &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine for the first time in June 1984 and he would go on to be featured on the cover of &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; in October 1985. He was featured on the covers of both magazines again in July &amp; October 1987 as well.

At the height of his fame, Rogowski was being paid &quot;between $4,000 and $8,000 a month&quot; for clothing and skateboarding equipment endorsements. By 1987, Rogowski was earning two dollars per skate deck from Vision, which was selling 7,000 decks on a monthly basis, resulting in royalties totaling US$14,000 for Rogowski (US$ in 2025). Additionally, Vision was also selling T-shirts, berets, hip packs, and stickers using the &quot;Gator&quot; name.

Rogowski was one of a group of elite skaters who enjoyed significant fame in the 1980s, alongside Christian Hosoi, Tony Hawk, Lance Mountain, and Steve Caballero. He was a charismatic, flamboyant personality who received fame and fortune during skateboarding&#x27;s return to popularity following the success of vert skateboarding.

In 1986, Rogowski was detained by police in Virginia Beach, VA after assaulting an officer in the parking lot of Mount Trashmore Park during the East Coast Assault pro contest. At a 1987 skate show in Scottsdale, Arizona, U.S., Rogowski was introduced to Brandi McClain and her good friend Jessica Bergsten, an aspiring model. Soon afterward, he began a tumultuous long-term relationship with McClain—they appeared together in numerous advertisements and promotional videos for Vision, which had become one of the top-selling skateboarding brands of the 1980s.

In late 1988 Rogowski was featured on the &quot;Swatch Impact Tour&quot; of 35 tour dates across the United States, which also showcased fellow pro-skaters Jeff Phillips, Kevin Staab, Chris Miller &amp; Joe Johnson. In 1989 Rogowski also worked as a stunt double on the 1989 film &quot;Gleaming the Cube&quot;, which starred Christian Slater, and appeared, along with McClain, in the music video for &quot;Free Fallin&#x27;&quot; by Tom Petty.

==Downhill slide==
Rogowski&#x27;s popularity declined as &#x27;vert skating&#x27;, popular in the 1980s, was supplanted by street skateboarding in the 1990s. Vision, the company he was with for the majority of his career, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. For re-invention, Rogowski changed his name to &quot;Gator&quot; Mark Anthony, explaining &quot;Rogowski&quot; was the name of the father he never knew.

After a severe accident in West Germany, where Rogowski either fell or was pushed from a hotel window and landed on a fence, Rogowski returned home to Carlsbad to recover. After befriending Augie Constantino, an ex-surfer turned born-again Christian who also became his &quot;spiritual advisor&quot;, Rogowski converted to a strict Evangelical form of Christianity, influencing Rogowski&#x27;s attitude and skateboard deck designs. After four years of dating McClain, Rogowski suggested the couple marry, proclaiming they &quot;can&#x27;t have sex anymore unless we get married.&quot; The sudden lifestyle change contributed to the end of McClain&#x27;s relationship with Rogowski, along with his occasional bouts of violence (which included his locking her in a closet) and unprovoked jealousy, and she returned to her parents&#x27; home in San Diego, California. Rogowski began a period of severe alcoholism following McClain&#x27;s departure.

==Murder of Jessica Bergsten==
Following the end of his relationship with McClain, Rogowski was jealous: He entered her home to steal gifts he had given her, he made threatening telephone calls to McClain&#x27;s new boyfriend, and he also threatened McClain directly.

On March 20, 1991, Rogowski talked with 22-year-old Bergsten for the first time in years. Bergsten asked Rogowski to show her around San Diego. They spent a day together on March 21, 1991. According to Rogowski, he and Bergsten then went back to his condo to watch movies, smoke weed, and drink wine. He then came up behind her and hit her in the head with a Club, a metal auto anti-theft device. After knocking her into semi-consciousness with several strikes, he handcuffed her, dragged her to his bedroom on the second floor, and raped her while she was shackled to his bed. Afterward, he placed her in a surfboard bag because he was concerned about the neighbors hearing the noise. Rogowski then either strangled or suffocated her and drove the body to the Shell Canyon desert, where he disposed of her corpse in a shallow grave.

Concerned when his daughter failed to answer phone calls, Bergsten&#x27;s father reported her missing and put up posters with her photo requesting information all over the city of San Diego. While out with his spiritual advisor and friend Auggie Constantino, Rogowski saw one of these posters. Though he did not say anything incriminating at the time, Constantino later said that Rogowski&#x27;s demeanor changed after seeing the poster.

Bergsten&#x27;s body was found by campers on April 10, 1991, but it was so decomposed that it could not be identified. Shortly thereafter, Rogowski confessed to his friend Constantino that: &quot;Remember that girl from the poster? She was the one I killed.&quot; Constantino encouraged Rogowski to confess his crime to the police.

Rogowski turned himself in on April 11, 1991, and led police to where he had disposed of Bergsten&#x27;s body. Police searched his home and found blood that soaked through the carpet padding and into the floorboards in two small spots, adjacent to where Bergsten&#x27;s head allegedly rested. In his confession, Rogowski claimed that he had killed Bergsten in a misplaced act of revenge toward McClain, saying that Bergsten was made from the &quot;same mold Brandi was made out of&quot;.

==Hearing and sentencing==
Rogowski was charged with murder and a &quot;special circumstances&quot; enhancement because the murder was committed during a rape. Under California law, this warrants the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. His lawyer, John Jimenez, challenged the validity and content of the confession. Jimenez also moved to dismiss the rape charge, insisting the decomposed body showed no signs of forcible rape, but the judge denied that request.

Following the advice of his attorney, Rogowski pled guilty to first-degree murder and rape, thus avoiding the death penalty or life without the chance of parole. In January 1992, at the plea hearing, Rogowski submitted a four-page written statement. He claimed to accept responsibility for his acts, but also began blaming outside factors unrelated to the death, such as his previous sexual activities outside of marriage, pornography, and &quot;not following the word of the Bible.&quot;

Rogowski was sentenced on March 6, 1992. Five uniformed bailiffs with metal detectors were at the hearing due to a rumor that Stephen Bergsten, the father of the victim, would attempt to harm Rogowski. With the bailiffs standing between Rogowski and Bergsten, Rogowski stated &quot;I sincerely hope that they can accept my apology for my carelessness,&quot; a statement that prompted outrage from Bergsten. In his victim impact statement, Bergsten called Rogowski a coward who would &quot;die a thousand deaths&quot;.

Rogowski received a 31-year-to-life prison sentence: six years for forcible rape and 25 years to life for the first-degree murder charges to be served consecutively. After entering prison, Rogowski was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

== Later statements ==
Although Rogowski claimed to take responsibility for his actions while in court, he later attempted to retract his police confession and change his story, placing a significant share of the blame on Jessica herself. In 1992, he told Cory Johnson, a writer for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, that:“The fact is that it wasn’t rape. It was more like an involuntary manslaughter. If it weren’t for my submission to her wiles and the temptation of having such sex with her …I don’t want to defame Jessica at all. I’m very, very sorry about what happened to her. I just want to make it known that I was led into a sexual situation that I didn’t want to have anything to do with...That night, I didn’t realize what kind of a purring feline she was. It’s really hard for me to say these things about Jessica, we lost her and I don’t feel good about that. I just want to make it known that I was led into a sexual situation that I didn’t want to have anything to do with. I was scared I’d be discovered with this wayward woman. There were a lot of kids in my neighborhood, my protégés in skateboarding who would have Bible studies with me. I was being an example to these impressionable kids. For them to see me with this woman and all that had been going on — the wine bottles, the cigarettes upstairs — it would have been devastating. In my attempt to quiet her, in her intoxicated and belligerent state, I had put my hand over her mouth to quiet her for a second so I could hear the voices and the footsteps coming up my walkway. She must have suffocated or had a seizure or a stroke or something. The next thing I knew, I look down and she’s not breathing and not moving.”Johnson wrote that during this interview he was &quot;listening to a man skating away from the idea that the murder was really his fault.&quot;

== Parole attempts ==
Rogowski was denied parole on February 7, 2011. Deputy District Attorney Richard Sachs argued that Rogowski remains an &quot;unreasonable risk to society&quot; and should remain imprisoned. A family member of Bergsten also attended the hearing and requested Rogowski remain incarcerated. On February 6, 2015, another parole hearing was scheduled, but Rogowski waived his right to a hearing for one year. On March 9, 2016, he was again denied parole for seven years.

On December 10, 2019, multiple media reports indicated that Rogowski&#x27;s parole board recommended parole. The California Board of Parole Hearings finalized the decision, and the case went before the California governor&#x27;s staff for review. On April 27, 2020, Rogowski&#x27;s parole grant was reversed by Governor Gavin Newsom, stating Rogowski needed to gain a &quot;deeper understanding&quot; of his crimes, possibly in reference to statements in which Rogowski attempted to shift responsibility away from himself and onto the victim.

In June 2022, Rogowski was granted parole with his attorney citing &quot;the parole board&#x27;s &#x27;trained psychologist found him to be a low risk of danger to the public.&#x27;&quot; This was to be followed by a 120-day review period by the board, and then up to 30 days for the Governor to make a final decision. However, Governor Gavin Newsom again reversed the parole board&#x27;s decision, ensuring Rogowski would continue to serve his sentence.

As of November 2024, Rogowski is incarcerated at Donovan State Prison.

==In media==
A documentary examining Mark Rogowski&#x27;s trajectory, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2003 by Palm Pictures. The film was written, directed, and produced by Helen Stickler, and features interviews with other professional skateboarders such as Tony Hawk, Kevin Staab, Lance Mountain, Ken Park, Steve Caballero, Jason Jessee, Craig Johnson, Stacy Peralta, and Rogowski. Since California law prohibits video interviews with prison inmates, Rogowski was interviewed over the recorded prison phone for the documentary. He gave details on his background, his downfall, and claimed to have remorse for murdering Jessica Bergsten.

The case was featured on an episode of &quot;Shattered&quot; on the Investigation Discovery channel.

<doc id="1090271" wikidata="Q2021601" url="?curid=1090271" title="Hilbre Islands">
<text>The Hilbre Islands ( ) are an archipelago consisting of three islands at the mouth of the estuary of the River Dee, the border between England and Wales at this point. The islands are administratively part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. They are a Local Nature Reserve and are within the estuary Site of Special Scientific Interest. As of 2012, the islands have no permanent residents. The name is thought to derive from a chapel built on the Island and dedicated to St. Hildeburgh. Visitors typically travel by foot to the Islands from West Kirby.

==Origin of the name==
Hilbre Island&#x27;s name derives from the dedication of a medieval chapel built on the island to St. Hildeburgh, an Anglo-Saxon holy woman, after which it became known as &quot;Hildeburgheye&quot; or Hildeburgh&#x27;s island. Hildeburgh is said to have lived on Hilbre Island in the 7th century as an anchorite. Some consider that she never existed, while others equate her with Saint Ermenhilde, the mother of Saint Werburgh to whom Chester Cathedral is dedicated, or St Edburga of Mercia, daughter of the pagan king Penda. The 19th-century St Hildeburgh&#x27;s Church, Hoylake, built nearby on the mainland, is named for her.

==History==
The islands are thought to have been occupied on and off since the Stone Age: several finds of Stone and Bronze Age items and Roman pottery items were discovered in 1926.

Hilbre Island may already have been a hermitage before the Norman invasion or at least a place of pilgrimage based around the lore of St Hildeburgh. In about 1080 a cell and church for Benedictine monks was established on Hilbre Island as a dependency of Chester Cathedral. Although not named directly, it is believed that all three islands were mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; in which mention is made of &quot;Chircheb&quot; (West Kirby) having two churches: one in the town and one on an island in the sea.

The islands were part of the lands of the Norman lord Robert of Rhuddlan. He gave the islands to the abbey at Saint-Evroul-sur-Ouche in Normandy, who in turn passed responsibility to the Abbey of St. Werburgh in Chester. The islands became a common place for pilgrimage in the 13th and 14th centuries. At the dissolution of the monasteries two monks were allowed to remain on the islands, as they maintained a beacon for shipping in the river mouth. The last monk left the islands in about 1550, as they were no longer considered a sanctuary, having become a centre for commerce and a busy trading port – so much so that a custom house was established to collect taxes on the goods traded. John Leland briefly describes Hilbre Island in his &quot;Itineraries&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 1538–43) and says that &quot;there was a Celle of Monkes of Chestre and a Pilgrimage of Our Lady of Hilbyri&quot;, though his contemporary description mentions only &quot;conies&quot; (rabbits) inhabiting the island. William Camden wrote of Hilbre in &quot;Britannia&quot; (1586), the first chorographical survey of the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, as follows: &quot;In the utmost brinke of this Promontorie lieth a small, hungrie, barren and sandie Isle called Il-bre, which had sometime a little cell of monkes in it.&quot;

In 1692 a small factory was set up to refine rock salt. There was also a beer house or inn, which was open when the writer Richard Ayton visited in 1813. With the silting of the River Dee trade switched to ports on the River Mersey and the trade vanished from the islands leading to the closure of the beer house; part of the structure of this building remains incorporated in the custodian&#x27;s residence.

The islands were bought in 1856 by the Trustees of the Liverpool Docks, which later became known as the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. Hilbre Island Lighthouse was constructed here in 1927. The islands were sold to Hoylake Council in 1945 for £2,500, passing to Wirral Borough Council on its formation in 1974.

==Location and character==
Hilbre Island, the largest of the group, is approximately in area, and lies about from Red Rocks, the nearest part of the mainland of the Wirral Peninsula. The other two islands are Middle Eye (or in older sources Middle Island and on Ordnance Survey maps Little Hilbre), which is about in size and Little Eye, which is considerably smaller. All three islands are formed of red Bunter sandstone. The main island and Little Hilbre are about apart, and Little Hilbre is about from Little Eye.

==Tourism==
Hilbre Island is one of 43 (unbridged) tidal islands that can be reached on foot from the mainland of Great Britain. The island can be reached on foot from West Kirby at low tide; this is a popular activity with tourists, especially during the summer months. Little Eye and Middle Eye are both unpopulated, but Hilbre Island has a few houses, some of which are privately owned.

==Facilities==
The most southerly building on the islands is the Hilbre Bird Observatory, from which birds are continuously monitored in connection with a national network of observatories and ringing stations. In January 2011 it was announced that there would be no permanent ranger. Wirral Council said that they had had difficulty finding a ranger prepared to live without mains electricity or running water on the islands. There are two composting toilets and a rain shelter on the main island.

<text>Padenghe sul Garda is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy. It is situated on the southwest coast of Lake Garda. Neighbouring communes are Calvagese della Riviera, Desenzano del Garda, Lonato del Garda, Moniga del Garda and Soiano del Lago.

==History==
Traces of prehistoric settlements have been found (arrowheads) in the peat bogs. More recent findings attest to the Roman presence.

In the Christian era Padenghe depended on the Parish of Desenzano and the first church, &quot;San Cassiano&quot;, was built next to the town center by the lake. This first village was abandoned because of the Hungarian invasions, straddling the 9th and 10th centuries, which forced the inhabitants to fortify a hill, where the castle was erected. In 1154 Padenghe is mentioned in the document with which Frederick Barbarossa, after the &quot;Diet of Roncaglia&quot;, recognizes the rights of Theobald, Bishop of Verona on certain territories in province of Brescia.

In the Middle Ages, the castle turned it into a Ghibelline fortress and was contested between Brescia and Verona. In 1330 Padenghe was conquered by the &quot;Scala&quot; family, who were driven by John of Bohemia, son of Henry VII. In 1362, the Cansignorio took the castle, but lost it two years later. At the end of the XIV century the town requested and obtained autonomy from the ruling Visconti. Each country had its own statutes.

In 1414 Pandolfo Malatesta, who was at the beginning of the century &quot;signore&quot; of Brescia, appointed Drugolo Castle (now in the territory of Lonato) to Padenghe removing it to the family Vimercati to punish rebellion. After the Peace of Lodi (1454), the Venetian Republic held a garrison in the castle of Padenghe.

The macaronic poet Teofilo Folengo, that at the beginning of 1500 stayed in the convent of Maguzzano, called the inhabitants of Padenghe &quot;superb people&quot;, and the French, during their rule, had to be afraid of it, though in 1509 the governor ordered the demolition of the castle, avoided by the intervention of Cardinal D&#x27;Amboise. In 1513 the Imperial German soldiers subjected to violence and looting. In 1532 Padenghe and other municipalities gravitating around the lower lake at Desenzano, which formed the &quot;Quadra di Campagna&quot;, they asked, not obtain it, independence from Salò, where the riviera was headed.

At the end of the 16th century the area was run by ruthless bandits, among which is remembered &quot;Giacomazzo of Padenghe&quot;, born Giacomo Dainese. In Padenghe was also born the painter &quot;Giovanni Andrea Bertanza&quot;, which inspired his work in Palma il Giovane and Veronese and worked in Valtenesi and the Riviera at the end of the 16th century. It is well to remember the Jesuit &quot;Giambattista Rodella&quot; (1724–94), a friend of Mazzucchelli, in whose house he lived for 22 years working in the drafting of the Dictionary of the writers of Italy and drafting their own works and translations. Padenghe Zuliani the brothers, who between 700 and 800 gained fame as a jurist and &quot;Andrea Francis&quot; as a physician, either by being involved in teaching.

During the Italian Resurgence was at Padenghe that the volunteers of Tito Speri took him prisoner, on 28 March 1848, the Austrian general Schonhals, fleeing insurgent Brescia. From 1928 to 1947 it became part of the town of &quot;Padenghe Moniga and Soiano&quot;, which later acquired autonomy.

==Places==

===Medieval castle===
It has preserved its original structure: solid walls of large stones and three towers (the central collapsed) on the north-west. Above the entrance, with traces of openings of the drawbridge and a pedestrian walkway, stands the main tower, square, without battlements. The castle and the garrison lived in &quot;castellino&quot;, built later in the curtain.

==Municipal government==
Padenghe is headed by a mayor (&#x27;) assisted by a legislative body, the &#x27;, and an executive body, the &#x27;. Since 1995 the mayor and members of the &#x27; are directly elected together by resident citizens, while from 1945 to 1995 the mayor was chosen by the legislative body. The &#x27; is chaired by the mayor, who appoints others members, called &#x27;. The offices of the &#x27; are housed in a building usually called the &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

Since 1995 the mayor of Padenghe is directly elected by citizens, originally every four, then every five years.

<doc id="1090288" wikidata="Q676553" url="?curid=1090288" title="Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland">
<text>The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ( ; ; ; ; sometimes the Swiss Federal Tribunal) is the supreme court of the Swiss Confederation and the head of the Swiss judiciary.

The Federal Supreme Court is headquartered in the Federal Courthouse in Lausanne in the canton of Vaud. Two divisions of the Federal Supreme Court, the third and the fourth public law division (until the end of 2022 the first and second social law division and formerly called Federal Insurance Court, as an organizationally independent unit of the Federal Supreme Court), are located in Lucerne. The Federal Assembly elects 40 justices to the Federal Supreme Court. The current president of the court is François Chaix.

== Functions ==
The Federal Supreme Court is the final arbiter on disputes in the field of civil law (citizens-citizens), the public arena (citizen-state), as well as in disputes between cantons or between cantons and the Confederation. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions in the field of human rights violations can be appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

As a state agency, the Federal Supreme Court examines the uniform application of federal law by the cantonal and federal courts of lower instance. It protects the rights that citizens have under the Federal Constitution. In the proceedings, the Federal Supreme Court examines the application of the law but does not examine the facts established by the lower courts, unless they are manifestly arbitrary.

When an appeal is filed, the Federal Supreme Court examines whether the law was correctly applied in the contested decision and thus ensures the uniform application of federal law throughout the country. Its decisions contribute to the development of the law and to its adaptation to new circumstances. The other courts and the administrative authorities use the decisions of the Federal Supreme Court as a reference and adopt their principles. Procedures before the Federal Supreme Court take place in writing. There are no court hearings with plaintiffs and defendants giving testimony and lawyers pleading their cases. The Federal Supreme Court bases its decisions on facts as they are established by the lower instances and described in the records of the previous proceedings. If the Federal Supreme Court concludes that a lower court has decided incorrectly, it overturns the contested decision and if necessary sends it back to the previous instance for a new decision. In addition to its work as the highest judicial authority, the Federal Supreme Court exercises administrative supervision over the Federal Criminal Court, the Federal Administrative Court and the Federal Patent Court.

According to the Constitution of Switzerland, the court has jurisdiction over violations of:
* Federal law
* Public international law
* Inter-cantonal law
* Cantonal constitutional rights
* Autonomy of municipalities, and other guarantees granted by the cantons to public corporate bodies
* Federal and cantonal provisions concerning political rights

Because of an emphasis on direct democracy through referendum, the Constitution precludes the Federal Supreme Court from reviewing acts of the Federal Parliament, unless such review is specifically provided for by statute.

Decisions of arbitral tribunals constituted under Swiss law, such as the Court of Arbitration for Sport, can be appealed to the Federal Supreme Court, although judicial review is limited to a very narrow set of questions of law in such cases.

== Organisation ==
The supervisory bodies are the Court Assembly, the Administrative Commission and the Conference of Presidents. The Court Assembly consists of all ordinary justices and is mainly responsible for the Court&#x27;s internal organisation. It designates the divisions, appoints their presidents and issues the procedural rules for the Court. The Administrative Commission is responsible for managing the Court&#x27;s administration. It is composed of the President of the Federal Supreme Court, the Vice-President and one other justice. The Conference of Presidents consists of the presidents of the various divisions and is responsible for the coordination of judicial decision-making among the divisions. The President of the Federal Supreme Court acts in an advisory capacity. The Secretary-General participates in meetings held by the Court Assembly, the Administrative Commission and the Conference of Presidents in an advisory capacity. The first woman to be elected into the Federal Supreme Court was Margrith Bigler-Eggenberger in 1972 one year after women were permitted to participate in elections on a federal level.

=== Federal justices ===

A total of 40 justices sit on the bench of the Federal Supreme Court. Currently 15 women and 25 men serve as federal justices. Of the federal justices currently serving on the bench, three have Italian, 14 French and 23 German as their native language. The justices are forbidden from engaging in any gainful occupation outside of their work as federal justices. The federal justices have the status of government officials.

The federal justices are proposed by the Judicial Committee and elected by the United Federal Assembly (National Council and Council of States) for a term of office of six years. They can be re-elected an unlimited number of times. There is, however, an upper age limit of 68. Anyone who has the right to vote at the federal level may be elected a federal justice; the law does not prescribe any legal training. In practice, however, only proven jurists from the judiciary, practicing legal profession, academia or the public sector are elected.

=== Deputy federal justices ===

The Federal Supreme Court numbers 19 deputy justices, who are also elected by the Federal Assembly. Of the deputy justices currently sitting on the bench, three have Italian, five French and 11 German as their native language. Ten of the deputy justices are women. The deputy federal justices serve in a part-time capacity, otherwise they are professors, practicing lawyers or cantonal judges. As a general rule, they serve as replacements for justices who have recused themselves or have taken ill, or when the Court&#x27;s docket has become overly full. In the proceedings on which they sit they have the same rights and obligations as the ordinary federal justices.

=== Court clerks ===

The court clerks are the judicial staff of the justices. Previously their primary task was to draft the written judgements after the decisions had been rendered in court. Due to the increasing case load of the Court, the court clerks are now also tasked with drafting the draft ruling in many cases. They also are involved in an advisory capacity in the preparatory stages of proceedings and during deliberations. They draft the final text of rulings based on the remarks made by the members of the division. Currently 177 court clerks serve on the Federal Supreme Court, approximately half of whom are women.

== Divisions ==
The 40 federal justices are elected by the United Federal Assembly. The Federal Supreme Court is composed of eight divisions, with five justices each. The tasks of the divisions differ according to the legal domains they cover (public law, private law, criminal law).

;First Public Law Division
Expropriations, national and regional spatial planning and construction law, environmental protection, political rights, international judicial cooperation in criminal matters, road traffic (including the revocation of driving licences), citizenship, public service personnel, fundamental rights such as equality under the law, guarantee of ownership, freedom of art and guarantees of due process.Division president: Stephan HaagJudges: François Chaix, Lorenz Kneubühler, Thomas Müller, Laurent Merz

<text>Paderno Dugnano (Milanese: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Milan, in Lombardy, northern Italy. It is bounded by &quot;comuni&quot; of Senago, Limbiate, Varedo, Cusano Milanino, Cormano, Nova Milanese, Bollate, Novate Milanese, Cinisello Balsamo. Paderno Dugnano is about 15 kilometers from the center of Milan.

Following the unification of Italy in 1861, a reorganization of the internal subdivisions of the country ensued. By decree of 17 March 1869, the &quot;comuni&quot; of Paderno, Dugnano, Incirano, Cassina Amata, and Palazzolo Milanese were fused into a new &quot;comune&quot; called Paderno Milanese.

Other names for the &quot;comune&quot; were proposed (including Padergnano and Borgosole) through the 1880s.
By decree of 1 February 1886, the &quot;comune&#x27;s&quot; name was formally changed to the current name of Paderno Dugnano.

Paderno Dugnano received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on 25 September 1989.

==Twin towns==
Paderno Dugnano is twinned with:

<doc id="1090291" wikidata="Q7057411" url="?curid=1090291" title="North Wirral Coastal Park">
<text>The North Wirral Coastal Park, on the Wirral Peninsula, England is a coastal park including public open space, common land, natural foreshore and sand-dunes. The park lies between Dove Point in Meols, and the Kings Parade in New Brighton, and was created in 1986.

The park is managed by the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral ranger service from their offices in the Leasowe Lighthouse, and occupies some 400 acres (988 hectares) of land in a four-mile stretch along the coastline making it Wirral&#x27;s largest park.

Although the park in its current form is relatively new, the history of the site goes back at least 5000 years to when the area, including the foreshore, was heavily forested. The remains of this coastal forestland are known as the &#x27;submerged forest&#x27; and can be seen at Dove Point, Meols, between the slipway and the groyne.

==Leisure pursuits==

===Wildlife===
The park, which has been granted triple-SI (Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)) status, is one of the country&#x27;s premier sites for wading bird populations. Among the species which can be found in the area are: Eurasian oystercatcher, common redshank, dunlin, sanderling, ruddy turnstone, northern lapwing, bar-tailed godwit and Eurasian curlew. The large population of fish, worms and crustaceans in the foreshore region sustains the bird wildlife. Among these are to be found: shore crabs, shrimps, prawns, lugworm, ragworm, cockles, tellin, peppery furrow shell, gobies, blennies, sole, plaice, flounder, dab and pipefish.

===Sports===
The park is a popular site for sailing, angling, swimming, cycling, picnicking, walking, jogging, ball games, bird watching and horse riding.

<doc id="1090296" wikidata="Q3778259" url="?curid=1090296" title="Denny, Falkirk">
<text>Denny () is a town in the Falkirk council area of Scotland. Historically in Stirlingshire, it is situated west of Falkirk, and northeast of Cumbernauld, adjacent to both the M80 and M876 motorways. At the 2011 census, Denny had a resident population of 8,300.

==History==
Denny is separated from neighbouring village Dunipace by the River Carron. A stone bridge was built over the river in 1825. Denny Town House was completed in 1931. Until the early 1980s, Denny was a centre for heavy industry, including several iron foundries, brickworks, a coal mine and paper mills. 

The first phase of a £7.6 million regeneration scheme in the town centre was completed in 2017.

==Notable people==
In the First World War 902 men signed up from Denny and Dunipace. Of those, 154 were killed in action or died on service. Decorations were earned by 31 men.

* Thomas Bain, politician
* John Adam Cramb, historian
* David Forrester, divine
* George William Gray, chemist
* Matthew Hay, doctor
* Carl Kirkwood, politician
* Christian Maclagan, archaeologist
* Stevie McCrorie, musician
* William Morehead, landowner

==Sport==
The local football team are Dunipace F.C., who play at Westfield Park where they moved to from their previous home of Carronbank. They compete in the East of Scotland Football League. Another team, Denny Hibs, operated in the Junior leagues from the 1900s to the 1930s – Dunipace were also part of that setup until the 2010s.

Notable sportspeople from Denny include:
* Sammy Baird, football player and manager

<doc id="1090299" wikidata="Q2945709" url="?curid=1090299" title="Regret (New Order song)">
<text>&quot;Regret&quot; is a song by British alternative rock band New Order. It was released on 5 April 1993 by London Records as the lead single from their sixth studio album, &quot;Republic&quot; (1993). Stephen Hague is credited as both the producer and as a co-writer. It was the band&#x27;s first single released on CentreDate Co Ltd (through London Records) following the collapse of Factory Records.

The song was a critical and commercial success, reaching the top 10 in Canada, Ireland, Portugal and the United Kingdom. It peaked at number 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—New Order&#x27;s highest placement on that chart—and reached number one on two other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Peter Care directed a music video for the song; the video appears on the &quot;Regret&quot; promotional VHS, as well as a DVD collection.

==Release==
The single was released worldwide in a variety of formats. The B-side of the single differed in the various releases, but all were remixes of the A-side, including the &quot;Fire Island Mix&quot;, and &quot;Junior Dub&quot; by Pete Heller and Terry Farley, and two Sabres of Paradise mixes.

==Critical reception==
In 2010 Pitchfork Media included the song at number 34 on their &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 90s&quot;. Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; also named it his 37th favourite single of the 1990s. John Bush of AllMusic described it &quot;as sublime a balance of obtuse lyrics, just barely emoted vocals, vague club leanings, and grooving synth melodics as their classic material.&quot; Peter Hook has said that &quot;Regret&quot; was the &quot;last good New Order song&quot;.

==Chart performance==
The song reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, the last time the band had a top five hit. &quot;Regret&quot; also peaked at number 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, thus becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the United States. The song also appeared on several other charts in the US, including two terms at number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart (now the Alternative Songs chart). During its second term at number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, &quot;Regret&quot; also topped the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart on the strength of its remixes. At the end of 1993, the song came in at number one on the Modern Rock Tracks&#x27; year-end chart. On Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart, the song debuted at number 80 on 15 May 1993 and climbed to its peak of number six on 3 July, staying there for two weeks and spending six weeks in the top 10. It also reached number five on the &quot;RPM&quot; Dance chart on 17 July.

==Live performances==
In 1993 New Order filmed a live performance of the song for &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in Venice Beach, California as part of an episode of the hit TV series &quot;Baywatch&quot;, featuring David Hasselhoff and various background actors and bikini-clad actresses dancing and playing on the beach. The band&#x27;s performance was directed by music video and feature film director Thomas Mignone and was broadcast via satellite to the United Kingdom.

<text>Ethan Phillips (born John Ethan Phillips February 8, 1955) is an American actor. He is best known for his television roles as Neelix on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and PR man Pete Downey on &quot;Benson&quot;.

==Personal life==
Phillips was raised on Long Island, New York. His father was the owner of Frankie &amp; Johnnie&#x27;s, a steakhouse on 45th and Eighth Avenue in New York City. He earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature from Boston University and a Master of Fine Arts from Cornell University. He plays the tenor saxophone in the Allan Wasserman Jazz Ensemble.

==Career==

===Theatre===
Phillips began his show business career in New York City, performing off-Broadway at theaters including Direct Theater, winning the Best of the Actors’ Festival there in 1977; at the Wonderhorse Theater, in the premiere of Christopher Durang&#x27;s &quot;The Nature and Purpose of the Universe&quot;; and at Playwrights Horizons in a revival of &quot;Eccentricities of a Nightingale&quot;. Tennessee Williams, who helped shape the latter production, wrote a new monologue for Phillips, which Williams personally dictated to him when it was realized that leading lady Jill Eikenberry needed more time for a dress change.

In 1979–80, Phillips appeared as Maurice Utrillo in the premier of Dennis McIntyre&#x27;s &quot;Modigliani&quot;, with Jeffrey DeMunn, at the Astor Place Theater. It ran for 208 performances.

Phillips performed in many plays in New York over the next 15 years, including Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Lips Together, Teeth Apart&quot; at the Lucille Lortel, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; with Kevin Kline at The Public Theater&#x27;s Delacorte Theater; and the Broadway premier of &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; at Lincoln Center, with Andrea Martin and Tim Curry, as well as new works for Ars Nova (theater), Ensemble Studio Theatre, Playwrights Horizons, the Hudson Guild Theater, the American Jewish Theater, and many others.

He went on to appear in the premier of David Mamet&#x27;s November with Nathan Lane and Laurie Metcalf at the Ethel Barrymore Theater and performed it once more with John Malkovich and Patti Lupone for Stars in the House. He played the title character opposite Peter Dinklage in &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot; for Bard College&#x27;s 2012 SummerScape Festival. In 2013–14 he appeared as Stanley Levison in Robert Schenkkan&#x27;s &quot;All the Way&quot; at the American Repertory Theater. Phillips moved with the show to Broadway&#x27;s Neil Simon Theater where the play won the Tony Award for Best Play and Best Actor, Bryan Cranston. More recently Phillips played leading roles in the premiers of Dennis Kelly’s &quot;Taking Care of Baby&quot;, Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and Sharyn Rothstein&#x27;s &quot;By the Water&quot;, all for the Manhattan Theatre Club (off-Broadway). Most recently, Phillips played Murray Lefkowitz in the Broadway premier of Ayad Akhtar&#x27;s &quot;&quot; at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theater.

Phillips&#x27; regional theater credits include leading roles for San Diego&#x27;s Old Globe Theater, the Alaska Repertory Theater, at Seattle Repertory Theater, at Baltimore&#x27;s Centerstage, for the Westport Country Playhouse, Boston Shakespeare Company, Actors Theater of Louisville, The American Repertory Theater, the Salt Lake Acting Co., and the McCarter Theatre. In Los Angeles, Phillips acted in &quot;Side Man&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse, in &quot;Lips Together, Teeth Apart&quot; for the Mark Taper Forum; in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; at the Geffen Playhouse, in &quot;The Bourgeois Gentleman&quot; for the Pasadena Symphony, and as Polonius in &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the Uprising Theater.

Phillips has been an actor at the Sundance Institute&#x27;s Playwrights Conference in Utah for six summers, where he developed his play &quot;Penguin Blues&quot;, which is published by Samuel French Inc. and included in &quot;The Best Short Plays of 1989&quot; (Applause, ed. Ramon Delgado). Based on his experiences at Sundance, Phillips helped found First Stage, a playwright development lab in Los Angeles.

===Film===
Phillips has appeared in over 50 films, beginning with &quot;Ragtime&quot; (directed by Miloš Forman). Other features include &quot;For Richer or Poorer&quot;, &quot;Jeffrey&quot;, &quot;The Shadow&quot;, &quot;Wagons East&quot;, &quot;The Man Without a Face&quot;, &quot;Green Card&quot;, &quot;Lean On Me&quot;, &quot;Critters&quot;, &quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot;, &quot;The Island&quot;, &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, and &quot;The Babysitters&quot;. His more recent films include &quot;Shadow Witness&quot;, &quot;Audrey&quot;, the Coen Brothers&#x27; &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot;, Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Irrational Man&quot;, and James DeMonaco&#x27;s &quot;The Purge: Election Year&quot;.

===Television===

<doc id="1090311" wikidata="Q688856" url="?curid=1090311" title="Commandant of the Coast Guard">
<text>The commandant of the Coast Guard is the service chief and highest-ranking member of the United States Coast Guard. The commandant is an admiral, appointed for a four-year term by the president of the United States upon confirmation by the United States Senate. The commandant is assisted by a vice commandant, who is also an admiral, and two area commanders (U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area and U.S. Coast Guard Atlantic Area) and two deputy commandants (deputy commandant for operations and deputy commandant for mission support), all of whom are vice admirals.

Though the United States Coast Guard is one of the six military branches of the United States, unlike the other service chiefs, the commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The commandant is, however, entitled to the same supplemental pay as each member of the Joint Chiefs, per ($4,000 per annum in 2009), and is accorded privilege of the floor under Senate Rule XXIII(1) as a &quot;de facto&quot; Joint Chiefs of Staff member during presidential addresses.

The commandant maintains operational command over the Coast Guard, unlike the chiefs of the other services, who serve only administrative roles. Thus, while the operational chain of command for the other services (per the Goldwater–Nichols Act) goes from the president through the secretary of defense to the combatant commanders of the unified combatant commands, command and control of the Coast Guard goes from the president through the secretary of homeland security (or secretary of defense, when the Coast Guard is acting as a service in the Department of the Navy) through the commandant. Prior to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, the United States Coast Guard or its predecessor, the Revenue Cutter Service operated under and the commandant reported to the secretary of transportation from 1966 to 2003, and the secretary of the treasury from 1790 until 1966.

As of 21 January 2025, the acting commandant is Admiral Kevin Lunday. 

==History==
The title of commandant dates to a 1923 act that distributed the commissioned line and engineer officers of the U.S. Coast Guard in grades. Before 1923, the rank and title of the head of the Coast Guard was &quot;captain-commandant.&quot; The rank &quot;captain-commandant&quot; originated in the Revenue Cutter Service in 1908. The original holder of that rank was the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Service (also known as the Revenue-Marine). The Coast Guard traces the lineage of commandants back to Captain Leonard G. Shepard, chief of the Revenue Marine-Bureau, even though he never officially received the title of captain-commandant. The captain-commandant position was created in 1908 when Captain Worth G. Ross was the first to actually hold the position. Although he was retired, Ross&#x27;s predecessor, Captain Charles F. Shoemaker, was elevated to the rank of captain-commandant. Shoemaker&#x27;s predecessor, Captain Shepard, had already died and was not elevated to the rank.

==Chiefs of the Revenue Marine Bureau==

Chiefs exercised centralized control over the Revenue-Marine Bureau.

*Captain Alexander V. Fraser, USRM, 1843–1848
*Captain Richard Evans, USRM, 1848–1849

In 1849 the Revenue-Marine Bureau was dissolved, and the Revenue Marine fell under the control the commissioner of customs until the Revenue-Marine Bureau was again established in 1869.

*N. Broughton Devereux, 1869–1871
*Sumner I. Kimball, 1871–1878
*Ezra Clark, 1878–1885
*Peter Bonnett, 1885–1889

==List of commandants==
There have been 28 commandants of the Coast Guard since the office of chief of the Revenue-Marine Bureau was transferred to a military billet. 

===Timeline===
edit “Fagan is the first woman to serve as Coast Guard Commandant, and simultaneously the first woman to lead a military branch in the United States, as well as being the first Coast Guard Commandant to be relieved for cause.” Add to end “in what the Trump White House deemed was her focus on DEI after the scandal following disclosure of a long history of sexual harassment and abuse of power within the Guard.”

<text>Dromore () is a town, townland and civil parish in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It is south west of Omagh on the A32 and from Enniskillen. The population of Dromore was 1,198 at the 2011 Census.

== History ==

The town was originally built in 1757 when the then Lord of the manor, William Hamilton, of Aughlish House gave a grant of the townland of Mullinacross, now called Dromore, to two families - Stewart and Humphreys. The town at that time consisted of only four houses. The original name of the townland is derived from an ancient stone cross which formerly stood on the top of the hill overlooking the town, and near to where the Cistercian Abbey was located. This abbey which was destroyed by a fire in
1690 is said to have been built on the site of a nunnery founded by Saint Patrick for Saint Cettumbria, the first Irish female who received the veil from his hands. In the village, still to be seen, are the ivy-clad remains of a Protestant church built in 1694.

During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, when Lord Blayney came to Tyrone, as Dromore was principally inhabited by rebels, he set it on fire and burned some of the houses, but owing to the exertions of Captain Charles Muirhead, Lieutenant James Alexander and the Rev. Benjamin Marshall the balance of the town was saved from destruction.

In the area around Dromore are to be found a number of ancient earthen forts. At Dullaghan about four miles to the northwest is a Druid&#x27;s Altar - a small roofless chamber tomb. A tannery was known to have existed in the village.

In the Dromore Parish at least nine locations of Mass Rocks are known. During the times of the Penal Laws certain &quot;Mass Gardens&quot; were located in the district where the local parishioners met in seclusion to celebrate Mass. It is said that Lord Belmore, who owned considerable property around Dromore, was so impressed with the devotion of the congregation at one of these gatherings, which he came across one day by chance, that he made available a piece of ground for the erection of a church with a condition that the chapel could not be seen from the village. Hence St Dympnas Chapel was built in a hollow. St Davogs chapel built in 1987 is where the Catholic Church of Dromore now stands.

In April 1921, during the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) ambushed Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) patrols in the area. On the night of 6–7 April, an RIC sergeant shot and wounded a Catholic girl on the main street in a sectarian attack. He was then shot dead by the girl&#x27;s brother, an IRA volunteer. In reprisal, Special Constables took three local IRA volunteers from their homes and summarily executed them, dumping their bodies by the roadside.

== Townlands of Dromore ==
Early Irish ancestors gave us the vast bulk of the local
placenames we use to this day, especially our townland names. The words in Irish for hill (druim, cnoc, cor, iomaire, mullan, tulach) predominate. The name &quot;Dromore&quot; (Droim Mor) itself means &quot;the great ridge&quot;. The word &quot;meen&quot; (found in Meenagowan and Meenagar) shows the wet, healthy nature of much of the land. Dromore parish consists of over sixty townlands; roughly elliptical in shape, it is bounded on the north by Drumquin, on the south by Trillick, on the west by Ederney and on the east by Omagh and Fintona.

Nowadays, townland names in particular are under threat owing to a new computerised system of addresses for rural homes, a system suited to areas in Great Britain where townlands do not exist. Roads are now to be given arbitrary names by administrators who do not possess a deep knowledge of the area, attaching arbitrary house numbers to them. For example, the former Corbally Road is to be known as &#x27;St. Dympnas Road&#x27;, on the specious argument that St. Dympna&#x27;s Catholic Church is situated near it. This inevitably has met considerable opposition with local residents who value of these ancient names as badges of personal identification, and many will continue to use them to preserve the ancient names for future generations and residents.

<text>Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu (; November 4, 1900 – April 17, 1954) was a Romanian communist politician and leading member of the Communist Party of Romania (PCR), also noted for his activities as a lawyer, sociologist and economist. For a while, he was a professor at the University of Bucharest. Pătrășcanu rose to a government position before the end of World War II and, after having disagreed with Stalinist tenets on several occasions, eventually came into conflict with the Romanian Communist government of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. He became a political prisoner and was ultimately executed. Fourteen years after Pătrășcanu&#x27;s death, Romania&#x27;s new communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, endorsed his rehabilitation as part of a change in policy.

== Early life ==
Pătrășcanu was born in Bacău to a leading political family, as the son of Poporanist figure Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu (Lucrețiu&#x27;s mother, Lucreția, was a scion of the Stoika family of Transylvanian petty nobility). He became a Poporanist and later a socialist in his youth, joining the Socialist Party of Romania in 1919, and working as editor of its newspaper, &quot;Socialismul&quot; (1921). Professionally, he was educated at the University of Bucharest&#x27;s Faculty of Law, from which he graduated in 1922, and at Leipzig University, earning his PhD in 1925.

He had an intense journalistic activity. Collaborator in numerous newspapers, where he published his articles under various pseudonyms: M Andreescu; Bercu; R. Boldur; Coca; V. Dragomir; Fischer; Ghiță; Grigorescu; Ion. C. Ion; N. Lascenco; Mihalcea; Miron; Victor Mălin; A. Moldoveanu; Andrei Moldoveanu; L. D. Pătrășcanu; Stătescu; Titu; Vrabie and with the initials A. M and L. D. P.

Increasingly radical after the success of the October Revolution, he was one of the original members of the PCR (known as PCdR at the time) in 1921. Pătrășcanu, Elek Köblös, and Ana and Marcel Pauker were the representatives of the group to the 4th Comintern Congress in Moscow (November–December 1922). Back in Romania, Pătrășcanu was arrested and imprisoned at Jilava in 1924 (the year when the party was outlawed); he went on hunger strike until being relocated to a prison hospital.

At the Kharkiv Congress of 1928, where he was present under the name Mironov, Pătrășcanu clashed with the Comintern overseer Bohumír Šmeral, as well as with many of his fellow party members, over the issue of Bessarabia and Moldovenism, which was to be passed into a resolution stating that Greater Romania was an imperialist entity. Pătrășcanu argued:

Moldovans are not a nation apart and—from a historical and geographical point of view—Moldovans are the same Romanians as the Romanians in Moldavia [on the right bank of the Prut River]. Thus, I believe that the introduction of such a false point renders the resolution itself false.

== 1930s ==

With Imre Aladar, Eugen Rozvan, and two others, Pătrășcanu was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in May 1931 as a candidate for the &quot;Workers and Peasants&#x27; Bloc&quot;, an umbrella group masking the outlawed party. Later in the same year, the 5th Party Congress (held in Soviet exile, at Gorikovo), chose him among the new Central Committee members while Alexander Stefanski rose to the position of general secretary.

In 1932, he was involved in polemics at the &quot;Criterion&quot; group, where he and his collaborator Belu Zilber defended a Stalinist view of Vladimir Lenin in front of criticism from the right-wing Mircea Vulcănescu and Mihail Polihroniade, as well as from the Austromarxist perspective of Henri H. Stahl.

Pătrășcanu again served as the PCdR&#x27;s representative to the Comintern in 1933, and 1934 (remaining in Moscow until 1935); Stelian Tănase argues that during this time he developed doubts about Stalinism itself. During the following years, Pătrășcanu continued to prioritize opposition to fascism, and remained active in the PCR. In 1936, he was heading the defense team of PCR members who were facing the much-publicized Craiova Trial, but was himself denounced as a communist and consequently handed the position to Ion Gheorghe Maurer.

== World War II imprisonment ==
Pătrășcanu was imprisoned during World War II and, after August 1940, spent time at the Târgu Jiu internment camp with Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and the &quot;prison faction&quot; of the Party (the communists inside Romania, virtually all imprisoned at various stages of the war, as opposed to those who had taken refuge inside the Soviet Union).

Like his fellow activist Scarlat Callimachi, he was set free by the National Legionary Government while the fascist Iron Guard, which allied Romania with Nazi Germany, was trying to preserve good relations with the Soviet Union. He subsequently followed orders from Teohari Georgescu to re-create a defunct outlet of the party, the cultural society &quot;Amicii URSS&quot; (&quot;Friends of the USSR&quot;).

In 1941, following the Legionary Rebellion, he was again arrested by the regime of &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu. After a release from camp for health reasons in 1943, he was under house arrest in Poiana Țapului; allowed to settle in Bucharest later in that year, he remained under supervision until May 1944.

== 1944 negotiations and fall of Foriș ==
According to Ioan Mocsony Stârcea, marshal of King Michael I&#x27;s court between 1942 and 1944, he met Pătrășcanu in April 1944 in order to mediate an agreement between the monarch and the Communists regarding a pro-Allied move to overthrow Antonescu and withdraw Romania, which was fighting the Soviets on the Eastern Front, from the Axis.

Pătrășcanu (together with Emil Bodnăraș) represented the Communist Party during the clandestine talks with the National Liberal and National Peasants&#x27; parties, aimed at overthrowing the Antonescu dictatorship. Corneliu Coposu, who later claimed had friendly contacts with Pătrășcanu at the time, also claimed that the latter had been selected by the Soviets as representative of the Communists (during negotiations in Cairo, Nikolai Novikov, the Soviet ambassador to Egypt, had reportedly first mentioned Pătrășcanu&#x27;s name to Barbu Știrbey for further contacts). It was also at this time that Gheorghiu-Dej and Bodnăraș, together with Constantin Pîrvulescu and Iosif Rangheț, toppled the general secretary Ștefan Foriș, and assumed leadership of the party (Gheorghiu-Dej had probably attracted Pătrășcanu&#x27;s support for the planned move as early as 1943).

According to Mocsony Stârcea, Pătrășcanu was responsible for a compromise between the Communist Party and institutions of the Romanian monarchy (allegedly assuring the king that it was not his party&#x27;s intent to proclaim a republic without a previous referendum on the matter). Coposu also claimed that, through Pătrășcanu, the Communist Party had entered negotiations with the other opposition groups and informed them of abandoning its previous theses of the future Romanian state.

== August 23 and government position ==
The collaboration led to the arrest of Ion Antonescu and Mihai Antonescu at the Royal Palace in Bucharest, during the August 23 Coup (1944). Pătrășcanu (together with Belu Zilber) authored the proclamation to the country which the king read on National Radio immediately after the coup, and, confronting the new Premier Constantin Sănătescu, imposed himself as a PCR representative on the delegation that signed Romania&#x27;s armistice with the Soviets, on September 12, 1944. Present in Moscow, he contacted Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca through their overseer Andrey Vyshinsky, reestablishing communication between the two major sections of the PCR. Pătrășcanu joined the Central Committee in 1945—after having returned to Romania with the Red Army late in 1944—and was largely responsible for the success his party had in controlling Romania&#x27;s legal framework for the following years.

During Soviet occupation, he served on the Romanian Politburo from 1946 to 1947 and held power in the new governments, as Minister without Portfolio (1944) and Minister of Justice (1944–1948). Pătrășcanu, who attempted to become general secretary early in 1944 (before Gheorghiu-Dej secured the position for himself), was considered leader of the party&#x27;s &quot;Secretariat Communists&quot; (perceived as less willing to follow Stalin&#x27;s directions).

After the ascension of the Petru Groza government, Pătrășcanu was also one of the initiators of purges and persecutions, being responsible for dismissing and arresting members of the civil service who were considered suspect, for the creation of the Romanian People&#x27;s Tribunals, as well as the appointment of prosecutors (promoting Avram Bunaciu, Constanța Crăciun, and Alexandra Sidorovici).

Citing a statement by Pătrășcanu rendered by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, British Trotskyist commentator Tony Cliff extended his critique of the people&#x27;s democracies of the Eastern Bloc to the realm of justice systems and retribution for war crimes. According to the American newspaper, Pătrășcanu had reassured media that &quot;industrialists, businessmen and bankers will escape punishment as war criminals&quot;; Cliff also argued that the new course in justice had failed to alter what he saw as Romania&#x27;s &quot;bureaucratic and militarist character&quot;. Indeed, under Pătrășcanu, Romania was the only country in Eastern Europe to initiate only a small number of court proceedings against accused war criminals and collaborators. This declaration of practically singular responsibility allowed many of those guilty of war crimes and collaboration to escape justice in postwar Romania. The postwar regime &quot;went easy&quot; on the mass of genocidal antisemites, sentencing them to relatively minor punishments. Early amnesties were often granted. For example, on 1 June 1945, Pătrășcanu successfully had 29 death sentences commuted by the King. 

Pătrășcanu put pressure on King Michael to sign legislation that went against the letter of the 1923 Constitution, which contributed to the latter&#x27;s decision to initiate the &quot;royal strike&quot; (a refusal to countersign documents issued by the Groza executive).

== Early conflicts with the Party ==

During the late 1940s, he is thought to have begun expressing his opposition to strict Stalinist guidelines; at the same time, Pătrășcanu had become suspect to the rest of the party leadership for his intellectual approach to socialism. Gheorghe Apostol, a collaborator of Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s, later expressed a particular view on the matter of Pătrășcanu&#x27;s relations with the rest of the party:
He was a reliable party intellectual. But he was also a very arrogant man, self-important, intolerant, and unwilling to communicate with his party comrades. And yet, Gheorghiu-Dej treasured him. Between &#x27;46-&#x27;48, Pătrășcanu changed quite a lot.&quot;

Around February 1945, he began to fear the possibility that Emil Bodnăraș was planning his assassination and that he intended to blame it on political opponents of the Communist Party (as a means to direct sympathy towards the latter group). He suspected that Bodnăraș had chosen to back Gheorghiu-Dej (allegedly fearing that Pătrășcanu was betraying the fragile alliance established before the fall of Ștefan Foriș). Consequently, he attempted to block Bodnăraș&#x27;s rise to power, and denounced his reputedly corrupt activities as Secretary in the Interior Ministry to the other members of the leadership.

Historiography is divided over the possibility of Pătrășcanu having initially allied himself with the PCR&#x27;s second in command, Ana Pauker, in her post-war confrontation with Gheorghiu-Dej. It is apparent that Pătrășcanu was alarmed by Pauker&#x27;s close cooperation with Soviet overseers, and especially by her tight connection with Dmitry Manuilsky; it was also contended that Pauker was intrigued by Pătrășcanu&#x27;s self-promotion in front of Soviet overseers during late 1944. Under arrest, however, Pătrășcanu asserted that he was closest to Pauker and Teohari Georgescu among the Romanian party leaders.

Although, overall, Pătrășcanu was argued to have been much less revolutionary-minded than various other PCR ideologues, his original perspective on Marxism remained strongly connected with party doctrine in its most essential points (including his intense advocacy of collectivization, using statistics to point out the existence of a class of &quot;chiaburi&quot;, the Romanian equivalent of the Soviet &quot;kulaks&quot;). He showed himself surprised when informed that the Soviet Union had planned a rapid communization of the country, and dismissed Vasile Luca and Pauker&#x27;s vocal support for the latter policy. Instead, he argued in favor of &quot;making a distinction inside the bourgeoisie&quot;, and opening the Communist Party to collaboration with the National Liberal Party. Based on this, he denounced Pauker&#x27;s agreement with Gheorghe Tătărescu&#x27;s National Liberal dissidence (the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, which he called &quot;a gang of con artists, blackmailers, and well-known bribers&quot;).

A serious break with the party line occurred in early 1946, when Pătrășcanu decided to take initiative and intervened in the standoff between King Michael I and the Petru Groza executive (an episode colloquially known as &quot;greva regală&quot;, &quot;the royal strike&quot;); with the help of Lena Constante, he approached the anti-communist figures Victor Rădulescu-Pogoneanu and Grigore Niculescu-Buzești, calling on them to convince the monarch to resume communications with his government.

== 1946 elections ==
During the campaign preceding the rigged elections of 1946, he was actively involved in the PCR&#x27;s electoral campaign in Transylvania, and, after drought and famine surfaced in several other areas of Romania, he attempted to persuade the peasants of Arad County to sell their wheat harvest to the government, to be used as aid. Received with suspicion, he later reported that he had eventually been able to carry out the task.

Responding to Hungarian-Romanian clashes, Pătrășcanu gave a speech in the city of Cluj, one in which he attempted to identify communism and patriotism. It stated:
In the name of the government and of the PCR, I raise my voice against border changes [in connection with the disputed status of newly-recovered Northern Transylvania]. Democratic Romania ensures equal rights to coinhabiting nationalities, but the Magyar population needs to understand that its belonging to the Romanian state is definitive. Nobody has the right to debate our borders.

He ran for the position of deputy in Arad County, and won through various electoral frauds (in Arad&#x27;s case, forty inspectors nominated by the government had sole control over counting and recording the results).

Pătrășcanu soon received harsh criticism from Gheorghiu-Dej, who branded the views expressed as &quot;chauvinism&quot; and &quot;revisionism&quot;. In parallel, the National Peasants&#x27; Party, as the main force opposing the PCR, published praises of Pătrășcanu in its paper &quot;Dreptatea&quot;, until Pătrășcanu met with the editor, Nicolae Carandino, and explained that such articles were harming his image inside the Communist Party. Nevertheless, Pătrășcanu&#x27;s writings of the time show that, in contrast with his 1928 point of view, he had largely accommodated Leninist principles regarding the national issue and Bessarabian topics, although he used more neutral terms than the ones present in official propaganda, and was known to have deplored the unwillingness of the PCR to reduce and refine its internationalist policies.

== Marginalisation ==
In 1946-1947, Pătrășcanu was nevertheless a member of the Tătărescu-headed Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, and, in fact, one of the signatories of the Peace Treaty with Romania. According to Belu Zilber, during this time, he read Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; (a glimpse into forced confessions alluding to the 1936-1937 Moscow Trials, the book was banned throughout the Eastern Bloc). The attitudes he expressed in Paris were considered nationalist by his Soviet overseers, and he himself complained to Gheorghiu-Dej about the party&#x27;s suspicion surrounding his diplomatic activities.

He was progressively marginalized inside the Party: his texts became subject to censorship and, on public occasions, his name was mentioned after those of less significant politicians. The Communist press virtually ceased referring to Pătrășcanu as &quot;comrade&quot;, and used instead the more distant formula &quot;Professor Pătrășcanu&quot;, at the same time as Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s speeches on combating internal currents of the Party. The VIth Party Congress in February 1948 did not confirm his Central Committee membership, and in the months following the event, he was removed from government office.

Belu Zilber claimed that having himself been subject to suspicion and marginalisation, he had attempted to warn Pătrășcanu of the change in climate, and had asked him to consider fleeing the Eastern Bloc, only to be stiffly rebuffed. Zilber was eventually arrested in February 1948, on suspicion that he had been a Siguranța Statului agent infiltrating the party.

== Securitate imprisonment and interrogations ==
On April 28, 1948, Pătrășcanu was arrested and came under the investigation of a party committee, comprising the high-ranking Communists Teohari Georgescu, Alexandru Drăghici, and Iosif Rangheț; interrogations were occasionally attended by Gheorghiu-Dej. His file indicates that the secret police (which was soon to become the Securitate) had been keeping him under surveillance from as early as the summer of 1946.

In the fall of 1949, Gheorghiu-Dej (apparently contradicting the committee&#x27;s conclusions) ordered Pătrășcanu&#x27;s transfer into the custody of the Secret Service of the Council of Ministers (SSI) under the provisional charge that Pătrășcanu had not reported various political crimes. A report on &quot;Titoism&quot; and collaboration with the maverick Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was presented to the Cominform: it placed Pătrășcanu, the Hungarian Republic&#x27;s László Rajk, and Bulgaria&#x27;s Traicho Kostov in the same camp, as &quot;imperialist agents&quot; (&quot;see Tito–Stalin split, Informbiro&quot;). The investigation also implicated Remus Koffler, who had been imprisoned in 1944, during the confrontation between Gheorghiu-Dej and Ștefan Foriș.

The day after the SSI began its inquiry, Pătrășcanu attempted suicide by slitting his veins with a smuggled razor blade; upon his recovery, he tried to take his life a second time by swallowing an overdose of sleeping pills.

Immediately after his second suicide attempt, the Pătrășcanu inquiry was transferred to the Interior Ministry, where it was suspended for a six-month period to enable officers to determine a factual basis in the case. When the inquiry resumed in February 1951, Interior Minister Teohari Georgescu ordered that the detainees in the case were not to be physically coerced, in stark contrast to the expressed instructions of the ministry&#x27;s chief Soviet adviser, Aleksandr Sakharovsky, to do everything necessary to determine the guilt of the accused. In the summer of 1951 Teohari Georgescu, together with his deputies Gheorghe Pintilie and Mișu Dulgheru, reached the conclusion that there was no basis to continue Pătrășcanu&#x27;s prosecution—and did so while the Soviet advisers were away on their summer vacation. When the advisers returned, they angrily vetoed any closing of the Pătrășcanu inquiry.

It was in 1951 that Pătrășcanu responded to the charges voiced by Gheorghiu-Dej after the Cluj incident, indicating that he had attempted to &quot;answer to the Hungarian revisionist campaign&quot;, as well as to aid his party in competing with the appeal of the National Peasants&#x27; Party among Romanians in Transylvania (to &quot;take the weapon that was Transylvania away from Maniu supporters&#x27; hands&quot;). He also criticized his own advocacy of a PCR alliance with the National Liberal Party.

He was accused of having been financed by &quot;bourgeois&quot; figures during the electoral campaign, and even of having been bought by agents of the United States or of planning, together with Ioan Mocsony Stârcea and Titoist agents, an &quot;imperialist&quot; insurrection in Săvârșin. The latter allegation also surfaced in the parallel investigations of Koffler and Emil Calmanovici.

Serious questions remain on the positions of the various Romanian Communist leaders on the Pătrășcanu case. The matter has not been satisfactorily resolved in the Romanian archives, for the simple reason that all records and transcripts of Politburo and Secretariat discussions on Pătrășcanu were summarily destroyed on Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s orders. In any case, no piece of evidence or confession was obtained by the inquiry until after May 1952, after the purge of Ana Pauker and Teohari Georgescu, who were accused by the Soviet adviser Sakharovskii of having &quot;sabotaged and postponed investigations&quot; in the Pătrășcanu case. The Central Committee plenum that purged them assigned the Pătrășcanu investigation to a team of Securitate officials and their Soviet advisors, directly supervised by Alexandru Drăghici, Alexandru Nicolschi, and Vladimir Mazuru. Under this new team, torture and beating began to be employed in interrogations in the Pătrășcanu case for the first time in the fall of 1952. In time, authorities also alleged that, before 1944, Pătrășcanu, like Zilber, had acted as an agent of Siguranța Statului.

== Trial and execution ==
Pătrășcanu was kept in detention until 1954, when he was executed on 17 April with Koffler at Jilava Prison, near Bucharest, after a show trial overseen by Iosif Chișinevschi. It is possible that he was tortured throughout the questioning conducted on direct orders from the Securitate&#x27;s Alexandru Drăghici, and there have been rumours that he had one leg amputated before his trial. Researcher Lavinia Betea notes however that, when his and Koffler&#x27;s body where exhumed in 1968, both their skeletons were complete. Moreover, she concludes that, unlike the case of other defendants, physical violence was never used against Pătrășcanu or his wife. The execution took place in the courtyard of Jilava Prison; Ion Mihai Pacepa claimed in his book, &quot;Cartea neagră a Securității&quot;, that Pătrășcanu was shot in the back of the head by a Securitate colonel.

In preparation for the procedures, the Securitate took direct inspiration from the Slánský trials in socialist Czechoslovakia (where a team of Romanian officers had been sent to take notes) and, possibly, from the Soviet Trial of the Twenty One (which was allegedly used as template for Calmanovici&#x27;s fabricated confession).

Pătrășcanu refused to be represented by a lawyer, and even to organize his own defense. Aside from some outbursts against the prosecutors, he stated:

I have nothing to say, except [that I] spit on the charges brought against me.

The actions taken against Pătrășcanu and others signaled the start of a wave of arrests and prison sentences, including that of his wife, as well as those of Harry Brauner, Lena Constante, Petre Pandrea (who was Pătrășcanu&#x27;s brother-in-law), Herant Torosian, Mocsony Stârcea, Calmanovici, Victoria Sârbu (who had been Ștefan Foriș&#x27;s lover), and Alexandru Ștefănescu. In preparation for the trial, the Securitate organized interrogations of political detainees or suspects (Gheorghe Tătărescu, who testified against Pătrășcanu and was the target of a sharp rebuke from the latter).

Belu Zilber, the first of the group to give in to Securitate pressures and confess to the charges, was verbally attacked by Pătrășcanu inside the courthouse — Pătrășcanu notably accused him of having invented the entire conspiracy account. Records of their various interrogations show that both he and Calmanovici identified Emil Bodnăraș as the main instigator of their downfall. Reportedly, Zilber had the following opinion of Pătrășcanu: &quot;He was anti-Stalinist and anti-Russian, but for the sake of power he would sign on any Stalinist ineptitude and wickedness. I think his only purpose in life, more than socialism, was to enter history.&quot;

== Rehabilitation ==
He was posthumously rehabilitated in April 1968 by Nicolae Ceaușescu, in the latter&#x27;s attempt to discredit his predecessors and establish his own legitimacy. The main target of this campaign, as indicated by a Central Committee resolution, was Drăghici:
[...] the party leadership has uncovered the anti-party line which Alexandru Drăghici, encouraged by servile, uncultured, and decaying elements, has introduced to the [Securitate] bodies&#x27; activities, attempting to remove them from party control and to erect them into supreme bodies standing above party and state leadership, thus causing serious harm to activity in various domains, including that of scientific research.

A party committee which included Ion Popescu-Puțuri investigated the matter of his arrest and interrogation, concluding that evidence against Pătrășcanu was fabricated, that he had been systematically beaten and otherwise ill-treated, and that a confession had been prepared for him to sign. This was coupled with various irregularities in procedures (such as the court having been given only 24 hours to assess evidence from years of investigation, and the death penalty having been decided by the party leadership before being imposed on the panel of judges). Evidence was also presented that some of the false confessions were designed as political weapons in internal party struggles (implicating names of politicians who were not facing trial at the time).

At the Party Plenum in late April 1968, Ceaușescu used Pătrășcanu&#x27;s case and other ones to single out the negative influence of Drăghici and Iosif Chișinevschi, while also placing suspicion on Emil Bodnăraș and Gheorghe Apostol, who had approved of Pătrășcanu&#x27;s purge. All of them were required to express &quot;self-criticism&quot;, while Gheorghiu-Dej was condemned for having &quot;initiated and overseen&quot; the measures.

Ceaușescu profited on the enduring perception of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu&#x27;s activities as patriotic and verging on dissidence, while shadowing his fundamental role in the creation of the new penal system in Romania. In fact, although he was frequently quoted and displayed by the regime, Pătrășcanu&#x27;s life was usually described in brief and vague sentences. In popular discourse, Pătrășcanu was also largely identified with positive causes, and remained among the most popular Communist figures after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 toppled the regime. Streets in Sector 3 of Bucharest and in Bacău were named after him.

== Sociology ==

=== Overview ===
In his most important volumes (most of which attracted public attention only after 1944), Pătrășcanu combined his commitment to Marxism-Leninism with his sociological training, producing an original outlook on social evolution (focusing on major trends in Romanian society from the time of the Danubian Principalities to his day).

Aside from its support for communist tenets, his work shared many characteristics with the prominent currents of the Romanian sociological school (notably, the attention paid to prevailing social contrasts in a peasant-dominated environment), and made occasional use of material provided by Dimitrie Gusti&#x27;s comprehensive surveys.

=== On feudalism and serfdom ===
According to Pătrășcanu, Moldavia and Wallachia had forsaken feudalism by the mid 18th century, maintaining instead a form of serfdom which had not been affected by the reforms of &quot;Hospodar&quot; Constantine Mavrocordatos. He argued that, whereas feudalism was supported by &quot;metayage&quot;, legislation passed by Mavrocordatos had endorsed and prolonged &quot;corvées&quot;, a system consecrated in the 1830s by the new Organic Statute. In his view, capitalism had manifested itself mainly as a reactionary force inside Romanian economy during the time of Phanariote rules. Thus, despite characteristic underdevelopment (which he also noted), the local economy had not contrasted with the stages postulated by Marxian economics.

Pătrășcanu contended that the first relevant social conflict had occurred in 1821, at the time of Tudor Vladimirescu&#x27;s Wallachian uprising. He rejected the notion that, despite Vladimirescu&#x27;s statements to the contrary, the rebellion had a peasant character, and argued instead that it was evidence of low-ranking boyars and merchants (&quot;the embryo of a class, that was to become the bourgeoisie&quot;) attempting to emancipate themselves from Ottoman pressures. In his view, its nationalist character (&quot;see Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire&quot;) had been manipulated by high-ranking boyars as a measure to dissuade adverse reactions to privileges.

=== On radicalism and reformism ===
The Wallachian Revolution of 1848, the most successful of similar revolts at the time, was, according to Pătrășcanu, a mature reaction of bourgeois circles against boyar supremacy (&quot;it only sought [...] to replace a [privileged] minority with another&quot;), but was generally not opposed to preserving an estate-based economy. He similarly rejected Junimea&#x27;s traditional criticism of post-1848 realities, indicating that, in its theory of &quot;forms without substance&quot;, the group had failed to note that, as a means to preserve several conservative tenets, Westernization in Romania had willingly, and not accidentally, adopted an incomplete form. 

In analyzing the history of liberalism and radicalism in Romania, he concluded that many of the most extreme social reformists had rallied in opposition to land reform (he saw this phenomenon as having made possible the toppling of Romania&#x27;s &quot;Domnitor&quot; Alexandru Ioan Cuza, whom he saw as a supporter of industrialization). He extended this criticism to socialist groups other than his own, arguing that the prevalent reformism was &quot;the cult of legalism&quot;.

These views placed Pătrășcanu in opposition to other left-wing authors in Romania — namely, the influential Poporanists, most of whom had emphasized various contradictions between the Marxian model and local realities, using Junimea&#x27;s theory as a fundament (aside from Pătrășcanu&#x27;s own father, these included his contemporary Virgil Madgearu and, to a certain degree, the Marxist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea). In parallel, Pătrășcanu&#x27;s theories were in sharp contrast with those held by advocates of economic liberalism, and especially with Ștefan Zeletin&#x27;s.

=== On the 20th century ===
As part of his reflection on post-1900 realities, Pătrășcanu contended that, relatively delayed in comparison to economies of the Western world, Romania had become subject to &quot;primitive accumulation of capital&quot;, where the role of colonialism was taken by exploitation of the peasantry. Like Madgearu, he appealed to the works of Rudolf Hilferding, but used them as a basis to argue that foreign capital was being accumulated inside Romania, and only transferred further through a limited number of industries. The Marxist historian Henri H. Stahl has challenged this particular thesis, calling it &quot;highly questionable&quot;.

While endorsing some aspects of Dobrogeanu-Gherea&#x27;s theories regarding the ways in which serfdom was allegedly prolonged, in a discreet form, even after the 20th century, Pătrășcanu challenged his refusal to investigate the effects of capitalism in rural areas. According to Pătrășcanu, the establishment of estate leaseholders, which he viewed as the cause for the 1907 revolt and other, more minor, peasant rebellions, was not a sign of prolonged feudalism, but one of capitalist penetration into agriculture. Contradicting the Social Democratic ideologists Lothar Rădăceanu and Șerban Voinea (whom he accused of having lost contact with the working class), Pătrășcanu theorized that the Romanian petite bourgeoisie was shrinking under pressure from successful capitalists, while rejecting the notion that civil servants belonged to the middle class.

Arguing in favor of a Romanian communist society during the late 1940s, Pătrășcanu indicated a series of essential steps to this goal: after discarding all legislation passed by the Ion Antonescu regime and purging the administrative apparatus, a political amnesty was to be declared, all properties upwards of 50 hectares were to be confiscated, the National Bank passed into state property while trade unions came under government supervision and a new labour code was enforced, and civil liberties were enhanced. Ultimately, a new people&#x27;s democratic government was to be imposed, removing all forms of antisemitism and chauvinism from public discourse and preserving good relations with the Soviet Union. Polemically, Pătrășcanu theorized that all these steps were &quot;democratic-bourgeois&quot;, and not socialist in their essence.

The arguably most influential of Pătrășcanu&#x27;s writings remains his analysis of the Romanian intelligentsia, part of . Transcending Leninist rhetoric, the work postulates a characteristic inability of Romanian intellectuals in sacrificing petty politics for the common good, and argues that Romanian elites, while in subservience to the State, have traditionally been attracted to extremism. On one instance in 1945, when theorizing about &quot;intellectual déclassés&quot;, he proposed their &quot;neutralization and systematic supervision&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu was married to Elena, born Herta Schwamen, who had a career as a stage designer (employed, with Lena Constante, by the Țăndărică Theater in Bucharest). Elena, who was Jewish, avoided the first wave of official antisemitic persecutions at the end of the 1930s (under the Octavian Goga government) by converting to the Romanian Orthodox Church (she was baptized by the socialist sympathiser Gala Galaction).

Elena Pătrășcanu was also a party activist, and was instrumental in maintaining links between her husband and other Communist leaders during the early stages of World War II. Implicated in the trial and forced to testify against Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, she was given eight years in prison. She spent over a year of that sentence at Dumbrăveni Prison, together with Victoria Sârbu and Lena Constante. 

The Pătrășcanus had no children.

== In art ==
Titus Popovici&#x27;s play (&quot;The Power and the Truth&quot;), published in the early 1970s (staged by Liviu Ciulei and filmed, in 1971, by Manole Marcus), centers on the character Petrescu, largely based on Pătrășcanu, who is persecuted by the party secretary Pavel Stoian (a disguised reference to Gheorghiu-Dej), while living to see his hopes for a better future fulfilled by Mihai Duma (standing for Ceaușescu). For a while after its publication, was translated into several languages and used as official propaganda in cultural contacts with the outside world.

In his 1993 film &quot;The Mirror&quot; (, also known as ), Sergiu Nicolaescu cast Șerban Ionescu as Pătrășcanu.

<text>Sholto Douglas was the mythical progenitor of Clan Douglas, a powerful and warlike family in medieval Scotland.

A mythical battle took place: &quot;in 767, between King &quot;Solvathius&quot; rightful king of Scotland and a pretender &quot;Donald Bane&quot;. The victory was so nearly Donald&#x27;s when a certain noble man, disdaining to see so bad a cause have good successe, struck in for the king and turned the fortunes of the day. When the king inquired about the knight who had done such valuable service, somebody exclaimed &#x27;Sholto du glasse!&#x27;...&#x27;Behold the black man!&#x27;.&quot;

In the story of Sholto Douglas, his youngest son is a commander of forces sent by the mythical Scottish king Achaius, to the court of Charlemagne to aid him in his wars against Desiderius, King of the Lombards. Marius Douglas is said to have settled in Piacenza where his descendants the became powerful local magnates, and eventual leaders of the Guelf faction of that city.

<text>Louis Brian Piccolo (October 31, 1943 – June 16, 1970) was an American professional football player who was a halfback for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) for four years. He played college football for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. He died at age 26 from embryonal cell carcinoma, an aggressive form of germ cell testicular cancer, first diagnosed after it had spread to his chest cavity.

Piccolo was the subject of the 1971 TV movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;, with a remake TV movie of the same name filmed in 2001. He was portrayed in the original film by James Caan and by Sean Maher in the 2001 remake.

==Early life==
Piccolo was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, the youngest of three sons of Joseph and Irene Piccolo. The family moved south to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when Piccolo was three, due to his parents&#x27; concerns for his brother Don&#x27;s health. Piccolo and his brothers were athletes, and he was a star running back on his high school football team, although he considered baseball his primary sport. He graduated from the former Central Catholic High School (now St. Thomas Aquinas High School) in Fort Lauderdale in 1961.

Piccolo played college football at Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; his only other scholarship offer was from Wichita State. He led the nation in rushing and scoring during his senior season in 1964, and was named the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Player of the Year, yet went unselected in both the AFL and NFL drafts.

In the balloting for the Heisman Trophy won by John Huarte of Notre Dame, Piccolo was tenth, just ahead of Joe Namath of Alabama, and future teammate Gale Sayers of Kansas.

A season earlier in 1963, Darryl Hill of the University of Maryland was the first and only African-American football player in the ACC. According to Lee Corso, a Maryland assistant coach at that time, Wake Forest had &quot;the worst atmosphere&quot; of any campus the Maryland football team visited. Piccolo went over to the Maryland bench, walked Hill over to the area in front of the student section and put his arm around him, silencing the crowd.

Following his spectacular senior season, Piccolo married his high school sweetheart, Joy Murrath, on December 26, 1964. They had three daughters: Lori, Traci, and Kristi.

==NFL career==
Because he was not selected in the 1965 NFL draft or AFL draft, Piccolo tried out for the Chicago Bears as a free agent. He made the team for the 1965 season, but only on the taxi squad (known today as the practice squad), meaning he could practice but not suit up for games. In 1966, he made the main roster but his playing time was primarily on special teams. In 1967 he got more playing time backing up superstar starting tailback Gale Sayers, which increased after Sayers&#x27; knee injury in November 1968. Piccolo&#x27;s biggest statistical year was 1968, during which he posted career bests with 450 yards on 123 carries (a 3.7 average), two touchdowns, and 28 receptions for 291 yards (a 10.4 average).

In 1969, Piccolo was moved up to starting fullback, with Sayers returning as halfback, placing the two in the same backfield on offense.

Players at that time were still segregated by race for hotel-room assignments. At the suggestion of the Bears&#x27; captain, the policy was changed and each player was reassigned by position, so that wide receivers would room together, quarterbacks would room together, etc. Running back was the only position of the 1969 Bears with one black and one white player, Sayers and Piccolo, respectively.

==Cancer and death==
The Bears were in the midst of a 1–13 season in 1969, the worst record in their history. Piccolo had earned a place in the starting lineup as an undersized fullback. Their only win came in the eighth game on November 9, a 38–7 home win over struggling Pittsburgh. Piccolo opened the scoring at Wrigley Field with a touchdown reception in the first quarter. The next week in Atlanta, he scored a fourth-quarter touchdown on a one-yard run, and then voluntarily removed himself from the game, something he had never done, raising great concern among his teammates and coaches. Breathing while playing had become extremely difficult for him, so when the team returned to Chicago, he was promptly sent for a medical examination at which he was diagnosed with embryonal cell carcinoma.

Soon after initial surgery at Sloan-Kettering in Manhattan, New York to remove the tumor, he underwent a second procedure in April 1970 to remove his left lung and left pectoral muscle. Bothered by continuing chest pain afterward, he was re-admitted to the hospital in early June where doctors determined the cancer had spread to other organs, particularly his liver. He died in the early morning of June 16 at the age of 26. The month before Piccolo&#x27;s death, Gale Sayers accepted the George S. Halas Award for Most Courageous Player and told the crowd they had selected the wrong person for the award. He said, &quot;I love Brian Piccolo, and I&#x27;d like all of you to love him, too. Tonight, when you hit your knees to pray, please ask God to love him, too.&quot;

Dick Butkus, Randy Jackson, Ralph Kurek, Ed O&#x27;Bradovich, Mike Pyle, and Gale Sayers were the six Bears teammates who served as pallbearers at Piccolo&#x27;s funeral at Christ the King Catholic Church in Chicago on June 19. He was buried at Saint Mary Catholic Cemetery in Evergreen Park, Illinois.

==Legacy==
* In 1972, Brian Piccolo Middle School 53 opened in Queens, New York on Nameoke Street in Far Rockaway. The school name was chosen by students after the first airing of &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;. The football jersey that belonged to Brian Piccolo that was displayed in the lobby has been missing since the school was renovated in the late 1990s.
* In August 1973, Orr Middle School, located on the West Side of Chicago on Keeler Avenue, was renamed after Piccolo to the Brian Piccolo Specialty School.
* In 1980, students at Wake Forest, Piccolo&#x27;s alma mater, began the Brian Piccolo Cancer Fund Drive in his memory. They raised money for the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Bowman Gray Medical Center of Wake Forest University. In addition, the Brian Piccolo Student Volunteer Program was established to provide undergraduates with an opportunity to work at the Cancer Center as volunteers. A residence hall at Wake Forest is also named in his honor.
* In memory of Piccolo&#x27;s accomplishments, the St. Thomas Aquinas High School football stadium in Fort Lauderdale is named after him. At the end of every football game, the school&#x27;s marching band plays &quot;The Hands of Time&quot;, the theme from &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;.
* Brian Piccolo Sports Park and Velodrome in Cooper City, Florida, a Fort Lauderdale suburb, is named for him. 
* Comcast SportsNet profiled Piccolo&#x27;s legacy and the lasting impression he left in the June 2007 episode of &quot;&#x27;net Impact&quot;.
* Each season since 1972, the Atlantic Coast Conference has awarded the Brian Piccolo Award to the conference&#x27;s &quot;Most Courageous Player&quot;. In 2007, the recipient was Matt Robinson of Wake Forest, the fourth player from Piccolo&#x27;s alma mater to be given the award; Wake Forest Quarterback Sam Hartman became the sixth in 2022. Since 1970, the Chicago Bears have also handed out an award by the same name to a rookie and (since 1992) a veteran who &quot;best exemplifies the courage, loyalty, teamwork, dedication and sense of humor&quot; of Piccolo. The winners are chosen by the Bears&#x27; veteran players.
* An Italian-American organization named UNICO (an acronym for Unity, Neighborliness, Integrity, Charity, and Opportunity) honors his memory each year by awarding the Brian Piccolo Award to courageous and outstanding athletes of Italian-American heritage. In 2009 Brian&#x27;s brother Don attended his first UNICO award ceremony in Rivervale, New Jersey, where he delivered a speech.
* The Chicago Bears honored Piccolo by retiring his jersey number 41.

==&quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;==

The film &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;, loosely based on Gale Sayers&#x27; autobiography, tells the story of the friendship between Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers and their time together while playing football for the Chicago Bears, up until Piccolo&#x27;s death. It first aired Tuesday, November 30, 1971, on ABC, less than 18 months after his death, and starred James Caan as Piccolo and Billy Dee Williams as Sayers. The movie was seen by 55 million viewers, half of the U.S. population that owned televisions at that time. Its success on television led to it also being later shown in theaters.

A remake aired in 2001 on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney,&quot; and starred Mekhi Phifer and Sean Maher.

==Biography==
Piccolo&#x27;s biography, &quot;Brian Piccolo: A Short Season&quot;, was written by Jeannie Morris (a journalist whose husband was former Bears teammate Johnny Morris) and featured passages written by Piccolo himself for a planned autobiography.

<text>Paderno Ponchielli (Soresinese: ; Cremunés: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Cremona, in Lombardy, northern Italy.

Before the unification of Italy in 1861, the town was known just as Paderno. After unification, the new government called on various municipalities with the same name to adjust and differentiate them. “Fasolaro” got added to the name Paderno. However, this did not meet with universal public approval as the word alluded to the production of common cowpeas (black-eyed peas) widespread in the area, which was considered as a possible source of mockery in neighboring communities.

In 1878, Umberto I, King of Italy, changed the name from Paderno Fasolaro to Paderno Cremonese. In 1928, when Paderno merged with the neighboring Ossolaro, the area took the name Paderno Ossolaro. Then, in 1934, with the celebration of 100th birthday of their native son, the composer Amilcare Ponchielli, the citizens petitioned to change the name to Paderno Ponchielli to honor him. On November 25, 1950, by a decree of the President of the Republic, Luigi Einaudi, the municipality came to be officially called Paderno Ponchielli.

<text>Vobarno (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of the Province of Brescia in the Italian region of Lombardy, at above sea-level, with about 8,300 inhabitants (2011). It is situated on the river Chiese, 5 km north of Salò and Lake Garda.

==History==
Although Neolithic remains have been found in the territory of the comune, nothing certain is known about the history of the area in prehistoric times nor in Antiquity, except for a single inscription, found near the town mentioning it as being at the confines of Italy.

Vobarno (known as Vobarna) in the Middle Ages was a fief of the bishops of Brescia, who at least twice sent representatives to enforce their suzerainty.

The 14th century and the beginning of the 15th saw Vobarno involved in the wars of the Scaliger, Visconti and Malatesta families, until, apparently moved by self-interest rather than force, they submitted of their own to Venice in 1426. Milan contested the new realities but was beaten in 1454, and thereafter Vobarna was a Venetian fief until 1797 when French troops under Napoleon conquered northern Italy and put an end to the independence of the doges. Vobarno, faithful to Venice, was put to flames and the sword. After the Napoleonic interlude, the town passed with Venice to the dominion of Austria, finally becoming part of united Italy by 1859.

==Twin towns==
Vobarno is twinned with:

* Sümeg, Hungary, since 2008

<doc id="1090380" wikidata="Q784269" url="?curid=1090380" title="Kalmar Strait">
<text>The Kalmar Strait () is a strait in the Baltic Sea, located between the Swedish island of Öland and the province of Småland of the Swedish mainland. The strait is about long and between and in width.

There is a road bridge across the strait, the Öland Bridge, opened in September 1972.

==Prehistory==
The areas along the Kalmar Strait have a heritage of Neolithic and Bronze Age habitation. Moreover, Mesolithic people crossed the strait on an ice bridge in the early Holocene period as glaciers began to recede from Öland. A place where early Mesolithic settlement of the island of Öland occurred is Alby, whose people migrated across the Kalmar Strait approximately 6000 BC. They established one of the oldest known Mesolithic villages in Northern Europe.

<doc id="1090387" wikidata="Q3431525" url="?curid=1090387" title="Rick Ankiel">
<text>Richard Alexander Ankiel (; born July 19, 1979) is an American former professional baseball center fielder and pitcher. He spent most of his Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the St. Louis Cardinals, but also played for the Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves, Washington Nationals, Houston Astros, and New York Mets.

Ankiel was a pitcher with the Cardinals from 1999 until 2001 when he found himself unable to throw strikes consistently. After trying to regain his pitching form in the minor leagues and briefly returning to the majors in 2004, he switched to the outfield in early 2005. For two and a half years, he honed his skills as a hitter and fielder in the Cardinals&#x27; minor-league system. He returned to the Cardinals on August 9, 2007. As a Cardinal until 2009, Ankiel hit 47 home runs as an outfielder and two as a pitcher. After the 2009 season, Ankiel became a free agent. Subsequently, he was signed by the Royals and later was traded to the Braves.

Ankiel became the first player after Babe Ruth to win at least 10 games as a pitcher and also hit at least 70 home runs. Ankiel is also the only player other than Ruth to both start a postseason game as a pitcher and hit a home run in the postseason as a position player. His change of position, and the fact that he played for six teams in a five-season span, suggest that Ankiel&#x27;s playing history represents &quot;one of the stranger careers in baseball history&quot; in the words of journalist Barry Petchesky.

==Early life and amateur career==
Ankiel was one of three children born to Denise and Richard Ankiel, Sr. His father worked various odd jobs, was arrested 14 times and convicted 6 times by the time Ankiel was an adult. He described his father as very tough on him, making him run wind sprints if he swung at bad pitches in Little League.

Ankiel attended Port St. Lucie High School in Florida, where he went 11–1 with a 0.47 earned run average (ERA) during his senior season, striking out 162 batters in 74 innings pitched, and was named the High School Player of the Year by &quot;USA Today&quot; in 1997.

==Professional career==
The St. Louis Cardinals selected Ankiel in the second round of the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft. He received a $2.5 million signing bonus. In 1998, he was voted the best pitching prospect in both the Carolina and Midwest League, and was the Carolina League&#x27;s All-Star starting pitcher, &quot;Baseball America&quot;″s first-team Minor League All-Star starting pitcher, and the Cardinals&#x27; Minor League Player of the Year. That year, he led all minor league pitchers in strikeouts with 222.

In 1999, Ankiel was named the Minor League Player of the Year by both &quot;Baseball America&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;. He was also Texas League All-Star pitcher, Double-A All-Star starting pitcher, Cardinals Minor League Player of the Year, and &quot;Baseball America&quot; First Team Minor League All-Star starting pitcher.

===1999 and 2000 seasons===
Ankiel debuted in 1999 in Montreal, against the Expos. He pitched his first full season in 2000 at the age of 20 (second youngest player in the league), posting an 11–7 record, a 3.50 ERA (tenth in the league), and 194 strikeouts (seventh in the league) in 30 games started. Ankiel threw a 94- to 97-mph fastball, a heavy sinker, and a fall-off-the-table curveball that was his main strikeout pitch. He struck out batters at a rate of 9.98 strikeouts per nine innings (second in the National League only to Randy Johnson), and allowed only 7.05 hits per nine innings (second only to Chan Ho Park). He came in second (to the Atlanta Braves&#x27; Rafael Furcal) in the NL Rookie of the Year voting. He received &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award.

===2000 postseason===
The Cardinals won the National League Central Division championship in 2000. Injuries to other pitchers left Ankiel and Darryl Kile as the only fully healthy starters left on the roster. Cardinals manager Tony La Russa chose Ankiel to start game one of the National League Division Series against veteran pitcher Greg Maddux of the Braves. To shield Ankiel from media pressure, La Russa had Kile answer questions to the media as if to start game one, and afterwards informed the media that Ankiel was starting.

In game one, Ankiel did not allow a run through the first two innings. His performance suddenly deteriorated in the third. He allowed four runs on two hits, four walks and throwing five wild pitches before being removed with two outs. Despite Ankiel facing eight batters and throwing 35 pitches, the Cardinals won the game. Ankiel shrugged off the event, joking that he set a record for wild pitches. He was the first pitcher to throw five wild pitches in an inning since Bert Cunningham of the Players&#x27; League in 1890. Ankiel set the record for wild pitches in a postseason career and postseason inning.

In his next start, game two of the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, Ankiel was removed in the first inning after throwing 20 pitches, five of which went past catcher Eli Marrero (only two were official wild pitches, as no runners were on base for the others), and the first of which sailed over the head of Mets&#x27; hitter Timo Perez. Ankiel appeared again in the seventh inning of game five facing four hitters, walking two and throwing two more wild pitches. The Cardinals lost the series four games to one to the Mets.

The source of Ankiel&#x27;s problems were unknown, but speculated to be psychological. His father had been sent to federal prison, and his parents were divorced during the 2000 season. His loss of control, often called the yips, has been compared to pitcher Steve Blass, who also became unable to consistently throw strikes for unknown reasons. A section of a book about Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, &quot;Three Nights in August,&quot; details Ankiel&#x27;s rise to the big leagues and loss of control as a pitcher in 2000–2001. La Russa has stated that putting Ankiel into Game 1 of the 2000 NLDS was &quot;a decision that perhaps haunts him more than any he has ever made.&quot;

===Control issues (2001–2004)===

Ankiel returned to the majors in 2001 but again had issues controlling his pitches, walking 25 batters and throwing five wild pitches in 24 innings, and was sent down to Triple-A. His problems in the minors became dramatic. In innings, Ankiel walked 17 batters and threw 12 wild pitches, accumulating a 20.77 ERA. He was demoted all the way down to the Rookie League Johnson City Cardinals, where he was successful as both a starting pitcher, with a 1.33 ERA in 14 starts, and a designated hitter, sporting a .638 slugging percentage with 10 home runs and 35 RBIs in 118 plate apperances. He was voted Rookie Level Player of the Year, Appalachian League All-Star left-handed pitcher, Rookie League All-Star starting pitcher, Appalachian League Pitcher of the Year, and Appalachian League All-Star designated hitter.

In 2002, Ankiel sat out the season due to a left elbow sprain, and was not cleared to throw until December. He returned to the minors in 2003, posting a 6.29 ERA in 10 starts before undergoing season-ending ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (Tommy John surgery) for his left elbow in July. In innings, he walked 49 batters and threw 10 wild pitches.

Ankiel returned to the majors in September 2004, posting a 5.40 ERA in five relief appearances. Ankiel&#x27;s control problems appeared to be gone, as he walked just one while striking out nine in ten innings. In the minors, he walked only two batters in innings, while striking out 23. He pitched in the winter Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, where he felt a &quot;twinge&quot; in his pitching elbow.

=== Switch to the outfield and knee injury (2005–2006) ===
On March 9, 2005, Ankiel announced that he was switching to the outfield, after a spring training scrimmage in which he threw only three strikes out of 23 pitches. In the minors in 2005, he continued to be a powerful batter, slugging over .500 in both Single-A and Double-A, with a combined 21 home runs in 55 games. He had a strong arm in the outfield as well, with 9 outfield assists.

In 2006, Ankiel was invited to spring training by the Cardinals as an outfielder, with a slim chance to make the team as a reserve player. His fielding impressed scouts and managers, and he had shown flashes of power hitting in the minors. However, he injured his left knee in February and had season-ending surgery on May 26.

===2007 season===
Ankiel was invited to the Cardinals&#x27; 2007 spring training and began that season with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. On May 28, 2007, he hit two home runs in a game against the Round Rock Express. He also hit an RBI double and made an over-the-shoulder catch in deep center field that saved two runs.

Ankiel was named a starting outfielder for the 2007 Triple-A All-Star Game. Through August 8, he had 32 home runs, 89 RBIs, and was hitting .267, including a three-home run performance on June 16 against the Iowa Cubs. He was the home run leader in the Pacific Coast League, and tied for second in RBIs. Defensively, Ankiel had seven errors in 95 games.

====Return to the majors====
On August 9, 2007, the Cardinals promoted Ankiel from Memphis after a roster spot was vacated by Scott Spiezio&#x27;s departure. In his first game, Ankiel batted second and played right field. In his first at bat, he received a prolonged standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd. During the seventh inning, he hit a three-run home run off Doug Brocail to right field to help the Cardinals defeat the San Diego Padres, 5–0. It was his first home run in the majors since April 2000 (as a pitcher), and made him the first player since Clint Hartung (1947) to hit his first major league home run as a pitcher and then hit a home run as a position player. The player before Hartung who accomplished this was Babe Ruth. After the game, Tony La Russa said that his only happier moment as a Cardinal was when they won the 2006 World Series. Two days later, against the Dodgers on August 11, Ankiel drew three standing ovations. He had three hits, including two home runs and three RBIs and made a spectacular catch in right field.

Ankiel&#x27;s comeback led syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer to write on August 17:
Ankiel hit his first grand slam in St. Louis against left-hander Eddie Guardado of the Cincinnati Reds on August 31 with the team trailing, 4–3, for an 8–5 win that broke a tie with Red Schoendienst for La Russa for most wins by a Cardinals manager. In a home game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 6, he recorded his second two–home run game of the season with a 3-for-4, 7-RBI effort, along with an over-the-shoulder catch in deep right field. On September 23, Ankiel had his first walk-off hit, a two-run triple to beat the Astros 4–3 on the last &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; game of the season.

Ankiel finished the year with a .285 batting average, 11 home runs, 39 RBIs, a .328 on-base percentage, .535 slugging percentage, and an .863 OPS in 47 games and 172 at-bats. The Cardinals, coming off a 2006 World Series title and three consecutive division championships, finished 2007 with a 78–84 record and missed the playoffs.

Following the season, Ankiel admitted to using human growth hormone (HGH) but said he was following doctor&#x27;s orders. HGH was not banned by Major League Baseball until 2005. An MLB investigation concluded that there was insufficient evidence that Ankiel violated the league&#x27;s drug policy.

===2008 season===
Ankiel helped the Cardinals defeat the Colorado Rockies on May 6 by recording two outfield assists and a home run to propel St. Louis to a 6–5 victory. Ankiel, on both assists, threw the ball from deep center field to Troy Glaus at third on the fly. He finished 2008 with a .264 batting average, 25 home runs, and 71 runs batted in.

===2009 season===
Ankiel was the Cardinals&#x27; leading hitter in spring training but struggled at the plate when the season started. During a May 4 game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Ankiel collided with the outfield wall and was carried off the field. The injury was reported as whiplash, and Ankiel was placed on the disabled list on May 7. He was re-activated on May 24. Ankiel platooned with Colby Rasmus for much of the remainder of the year and finished the season with 11 home runs, 38 RBI, and a .231 batting average.

===2010 season===

==== Kansas City Royals ====
On January 5, 2010, Ankiel signed a one-year, $3.25 million contract with the Kansas City Royals. He began the season as the Royals&#x27; starting center fielder but was placed on the disabled list on May 5 with a strained right quadriceps after playing sparingly beginning on April 24. He was activated on July 23, and replaced an injured David DeJesus midway through the game in center field. 

==== Atlanta Braves ====
On July 31, Ankiel and reliever Kyle Farnsworth were traded to the Atlanta Braves for Jesse Chavez, Gregor Blanco, and Tim Collins.

On October 8, in the second game of the 2010 NLDS against the San Francisco Giants, Ankiel hit his first career postseason home run into McCovey Cove off Giants reliever Ramón Ramírez in the top of the 11th inning, leading the Braves to a 5–4 win. Ankiel joined Barry Bonds as the only players to hit a ball into the cove in the postseason. In a television interview after the game, Ankiel called the home run &quot;the pinnacle of anything I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; He finished the 2010 season with a .232 batting average, 6 home runs, and 24 RBI in 74 games.

On November 2, the Braves declined Ankiel&#x27;s club option, making him a free agent. 

=== Washington Nationals (2011–2012) ===

On December 20, 2010, the Washington Nationals signed him to a one-year, $1.5 million contract.

Ankiel played in 122 games for the Nationals in 2011, hitting .239 with 9 home runs and 37 RBIs while platooning in center field with Roger Bernadina. He had a .996 fielding percentage for the season, committing one error in 113 games in the outfield.

The Nationals re-signed Ankiel to a one-year, $1.25 million minor league deal for 2012. He began the season on the disabled list, rehabbing in the minors. Once promoted, his role was limited as a backup outfielder. In 68 games, he hit .228 with five home runs and 15 RBIs in 158 at-bats. He started 37 games in center field and played 62 total games in center field. On July 19, as Nationals closer Drew Storen was added to the roster, and Ankiel was designated for assignment by the Nationals to make room. On July 27, Ankiel was released by the Nationals.

===2013 season===

On January 17, 2013, the Houston Astros signed Ankiel with an invite to spring training as a non-roster invitee. On March 31, Ankiel homered in the Astros&#x27; regular season opener against the Texas Rangers in Houston. He was designated for assignment on May 6 and released on May 9.

On May 13, the New York Mets signed Ankiel and immediately placed him into their starting lineup. He collected two hits, including a two-run homer, against the Cardinals in St. Louis on May 15.

His offensive production regressed. Following an 0-for-4, three-strikeout performance against the Miami Marlins on June 8, giving him a combined 60 strikeouts in 128 at-bats for the season, Ankiel was designated for assignment by the Mets. He became a free agent on June 13. In 45 games with the Astros and Mets, he batted .188 with 7 home runs, 18 RBI, and a .422 slugging percentage.

===Retirement===
Ankiel announced his retirement from Major League Baseball on March 5, 2014.

On January 8, 2015, the Washington Nationals announced that they had hired Ankiel as a &quot;Life Skills Coordinator.&quot; In this role, Ankiel mentored players both at the major league level as well as in the Nationals&#x27; farm system.

In April 2017, Ankiel&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Phenomenon: Pressure, The Yips, and the Pitch that Changed My Life&quot;, was published.

In August 2018, Ankiel stated that he was &quot;toying with&quot; the idea of possibly pitching in professional baseball again. Later that month, Ankiel announced that he was planning a return to Major League Baseball for the 2019 season as a pitcher. In October, he underwent &quot;primary repair&quot; surgery, an alternative to Tommy John surgery, in his pitching elbow. Ankiel officially ended his comeback attempt on July 30, 2019. He was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received no votes in his only year on the ballot.

After retiring, Ankiel became a commentator and studio analyst for Bally Sports Midwest, frequently joining Dan McLaughlin to call Cardinals games.

==Personal life==
Ankiel&#x27;s father was sentenced to six years in federal prison for drug smuggling in March 2000. His parents divorced the same year.

Ankiel lives in Jupiter, Florida with wife, Lory. They have two sons.

<doc id="1090391" wikidata="Q396606" url="?curid=1090391" title="Omar Karami">
<text>Omar Abdul Hamid Karami (last name also spelled Karamé and Karameh) (; 7 September 1934 – 1 January 2015) was the 29th prime minister of Lebanon for two non-consecutive terms. He was Prime Minister for the first time from 24 December 1990, when Selim al-Hoss gave up power, until May 1992, when he resigned due to economic instability. He was again Prime Minister from October 2004 to April 2005.

==Early life==
Karami was born Omar Abdul Hamid Karami in the northern Lebanese town of An Nouri, near Tripoli in 1934 to a Sunni Muslim family. He was the son of former prime minister and independence hero Abdul Hamid Karami. He was the brother of Arab nationalist, eight-time prime minister and major Lebanese statesman, Rashid Karami, who was assassinated in 1987. Omar Karami held a degree in law, which he received from Cairo University in 1956.

==Career==
Karami worked both as a lawyer and businessman. In 1989, he was appointed education minister and on 24 December 1990, prime minister. He was in office until May 1992 when he resigned due to the collapse of the Lebanese pound against the US dollar which provoked street riots. Karami was elected as Parliamentary representative of Tripoli in 1991, following his brother&#x27;s assassination. In late October 2004, he formed a cabinet after the resignation of Rafik Hariri.

Due to the assassination of ex-prime minister Hariri on 14 February 2005, members of the opposition blamed Syria for the assassination, and demanded Syria withdraw its troops and intelligence personnel from Lebanon. Protests grew in Beirut despite an official ban on public protests, and the opposition planned to call for a no confidence vote. Amid the growing pressure, Karami announced on 28 February 2005 that his government would resign, although it remained temporarily in a caretaker role.

Ten days after the resignation, following protests in Beirut that were supportive of president Karami, President Émile Lahoud re-appointed Karami as prime minister on 10 March and asked him to form a new government. With the backing of a majority of deputies, Karami called on all parties to join a government of national unity.

On 13 April, after failing to create a new government, Karami resigned again. He was replaced by Najib Mikati in the post. This resignation added to the turmoil already prevalent in Lebanon since Hariri&#x27;s assassination as now there was no government to call the elections which were due that upcoming May. Karami did not run for office in the 2005 general elections.

==Personal life==

<text>The Heart Mountain War Relocation Center, named after nearby Heart Mountain and located midway between the northwest Wyoming towns of Cody and Powell, was one of ten concentration camps used for the internment of Japanese Americans evicted during World War II from their local communities (including their homes, businesses, and college residencies) in the West Coast Exclusion Zone by the executive order of President Franklin Roosevelt (after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, upon the recommendation of Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt).

This site was managed before the war by the federal Bureau of Reclamation as the would-be site of a major irrigation project. Construction of the camp&#x27;s 650 military-style barracks and surrounding guard towers began in June 1942. The camp opened August 11, when the first Japanese Americans were shipped in by train from the internment program&#x27;s &quot;assembly centers&quot; in Pomona, Santa Anita, and Portland. The camp would hold a total of 13,997 Japanese Americans over the next three years, with a peak population of 10,767, making it the third-largest &quot;town&quot; in Wyoming before its November 10, 1945, closure. Among the inmates, the notation &quot;&quot; was sometimes applied.

Heart Mountain is perhaps best known for many of its younger residents challenging the controversial draft of Nisei males from camp in order to highlight the loss of their rights through the incarceration. The Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee, led by Frank Emi and several others, was particularly active in this resistance, encouraging internees to refuse U.S. military induction until they and their families were released from camp and their civil rights were restored. Heart Mountain had the highest rate of draft resistance of all ten camps, with 85 young men and seven Fair Play Committee leaders ultimately sentenced and imprisoned for Selective Service Act violations. (At the same time, 649 Japanese American men—volunteers and draftees—joined the American military from Heart Mountain. In 1944, internees dedicated an Honor Roll listing the names of these soldiers, located near the camp&#x27;s main gate.)

In 1988 and 1992 the U.S. government passed laws both formally apologizing to Japanese Americans for the internment-era violations of their constitutional, state, and personal property rights, and, establishing a temporary fund to pay limited reparations ($20,000) to still-living former internees (or their children) who applied and qualified for them. The site of the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center is considered to be the best preserved of the ten incarceration centers constructed during World War II. The street grid and numerous foundations are still visible. Four of the original barracks survive in place. A number of others sold and moved after the war have been identified in surrounding counties and may one day be returned to their original locations. In early 2007, of the center were listed as a National Historic Landmark. The Bureau of Reclamation owns within the landmark boundary and currently administers the site. The remaining were purchased by the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation, a nonprofit organization established in 1996 to memorialize the center&#x27;s internees and to interpret the site&#x27;s historical significance.

The Foundation runs the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, opened in 2011, located at 1539 Road 19, Powell. The museum includes photographs, artifacts, oral histories and interactive exhibits about the wartime relocation of Japanese Americans, anti-Asian prejudice in America and the factors leading to their enforced relocation and confinement.

==Establishing the camp==

===Pre-war history===
The land that would become the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center was originally part of the Shoshone Project, an irrigation project under the auspices of the Bureau of Reclamation. In 1897, of land surrounding the Shoshone River in northwestern Wyoming was purchased by William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody and Nate Salisbury, who in May 1899 acquired water rights to irrigate surrounding Cody, Wyoming. After the project proved too costly for the original investors, the Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners petitioned the federal government to take it over. The rights for the Cody-Salisbury tract were transferred to the Secretary of the Interior in 1904 and the Shoshone Project was approved later that year as one of the earliest Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) projects.

In 1937 during the Great Depression, the BOR used private contractors and Civilian Conservation Corps laborers to begin construction on the Shoshone Canyon Conduit and the Heart Mountain Canal, as one of a number of governmental infrastructure projects. The conduit, spanning 2.8 miles, was completed in September 1938. Construction on the unfinished canal stopped after the United States entered World War II.

===Executive Order 9066===
Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized military commanders to create zones from which &quot;any or all persons may be excluded.&quot; The War Department had requested this and designated Western Washington and Oregon, southern Arizona, and all of California as Exclusion Zones on March 2, 1942. Four days later, the executive order informally extended to Alaska, covering the entire West Coast of the United States. It defined Japanese Americans, Italian Americans and German Americans as peoples to be excluded from these areas. Soon after the War Department initiated the removal of over 110,000 Japanese Americans from these areas, forcing them into temporary &quot;assembly centers&quot; run by the Wartime Civil Control Administration. Typically, these centers were hastily converted large public spaces, such as fairgrounds and horse racing tracks, while construction on Heart Mountain and the other more permanent &quot;relocation centers&quot; were completed.

===Building Heart Mountain===
On May 23, 1942, the War Department announced that one of the camps for displaced Japanese Americans would be located in Wyoming, and several communities, hoping to capitalize on internee labor for irrigation and land development projects, vied for the site. Heart Mountain was chosen because it was remote yet convenient, isolated from the nearest towns but close to fresh water and adjacent to a railroad spur and depot where Japanese Americans, as well as food and supplies, could be off-loaded.

On June 1, 1942, the Bureau of Reclamation transferred of the Heart Mountain Irrigation Project and several CCC buildings to the War Relocation Authority, the branch of the Western Defense Command responsible for administration of the incarceration program. More than 2,000 laborers, including men employed by the Harza Engineering Company of Chicago and the Hamilton Bridge Company of Kansas City, began work on June 8, under the direction of the Army Corps of Engineers. The workers enclosed of arid buffalo grass and sagebrush with a high barbed wire fence and nine guard towers. Within this perimeter, 650 military-style barracks were laid out in a street grid, with administrative, hospital, educational, and utility facilities, and 468 residential dormitories to house the internees.

All of the buildings were electrified, which was at the time a rarity in Wyoming, but due to time constraints and a largely unskilled workforce, the majority of these &quot;buildings&quot; were poorly constructed. Army higher-ups gave the site&#x27;s chief engineer only sixty days to complete the project, and newspaper ads recruiting laborers promised jobs &quot;if you can drive a nail&quot; while workers boasted that it took them only 58 minutes to build an apartment barracks. Thousands of acres of surrounding land were designated for agricultural purposes, as the center was expected for the most part to be self-sufficient.

==World War II==

===Life in camp===

The first inmates arrived in Heart Mountain on August 12, 1942: 6,448 from Los Angeles County; 2,572 from Santa Clara County; 678 from San Francisco; and 843 from Yakima County in Washington. After being assigned a barracks based on the size of their families, they began making small improvements on their new &quot;apartments,&quot; hanging bed sheets to create extra &quot;rooms,&quot; and stuffing newspaper and rags into cracks in the shoddily constructed walls and floors to keep out dust and cold. Some inmates went so far as to order tools from Sears &amp; Roebuck catalogs in order to make repairs. Each barracks unit contained one light, a wood-burning stove, and an army cot and two blankets for each member of the family. Bathrooms and laundry facilities were located in shared utility halls, and meals were served in communal mess halls, both assigned by block. Armed military police manned the nine guard towers surrounding the camp.

Leadership positions in Heart Mountain were occupied by European-American administrators, although Nisei block managers and Issei councilmen were elected by the inmate population and participated, in a limited capacity, in administration of the camp. Employment opportunities were available in the hospital, camp schools and mess halls, as well as the garment factory, cabinet shop, sawmill and silk screen shop run by camp officials, although most inmates received a rather paltry salary of $12–$19 a month, due to the WRA&#x27;s decision that the Japanese could not earn more than an army private regardless of job. (Caucasian nurses in the Heart Mountain hospital, for example, were paid $150/month compared to the $19/month given Japanese-American doctors) Additionally, some inmates worked on the unfinished Heart Mountain Canal for the Bureau of Reclamation, or did agricultural work outside the camp.
Children of inmates began school in barrack classrooms in October 1942. Books, school supplies, and furniture were limited. Despite the poor condition of the facilities, attending school offered a sense of normalcy to camp children. In May 1943, the camp high school had been constructed, and the elementary school restructured. The high school, which educated 1,500 students in its first year, featured regular classrooms, a gymnasium and library. Its sports team, including its football team, The Heart Mountain Eagles, eventually competed against other local high school teams.

Other sporting events, movie theaters, religious services, crafting groups, and social clubs kept inmates entertained and provided a distraction from the dullness of camp life. Knitting, sewing, and woodcarving were popular not only for entertainment, but because they allowed inmates to improve their dilapidated living conditions. Among children, Girl and Boy Scout programs flourished, as many Nisei had been members before internment. Heart Mountain&#x27;s thirteen scout troops and two Cub Scout packs were the most of any of the ten camps. Scouts participated in normal scouting activities such as hiking, craft making, and swimming.

===Draft resistance===
In early 1943, camp officials began to administer a &quot;Leave Clearance Form,&quot; better known as the loyalty questionnaire because of two controversial questions that tried to distinguish loyal and disloyal Japanese Americans. Question 27 asked whether men would be willing to serve in the armed forces, while Question 28 asked inmates to forswear all allegiance to the Emperor of Japan. Many, confused by the questionnaire&#x27;s wording, fearing it was a trick and any answer would be misconstrued, or, offended by the questions&#x27; implications, answered &quot;no&quot; to one or both questions, or gave a qualified response like, &quot;I will serve when I am free.&quot; Soon after, Kiyoshi Okamoto organized the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee to protest the infringement of Nisei citizen rights, and Frank Emi, Paul Nakadate and others began posting fliers around camp encouraging others not to respond to the questions.

When draft orders began arriving in Heart Mountain, Emi, Okamoto and the other leaders of the Fair Play Committee held public meetings to discuss the unconstitutionality of the incarceration and encourage other inmates to refuse military service until their freedom was restored. On March 25, 1944, twelve Heart Mountain resisters who had not reported for their draft physicals were arrested by U.S. Marshals. Emi and two other Committee members who had not received draft notices (due to their age or domestic status) tried to walk out of camp to highlight their status as prisoners of the government.

In July 1944, in the largest mass trial in Wyoming history, sixty-three Heart Mountain inmates were prosecuted after refusing to show up for their induction and convicted of felony draft evasion. A total of 300 draft resisters from eight WRA camps, including an additional 22 from Heart Mountain sentenced in a subsequent trial, were arrested for this charge, and most served time in federal prison. The seven older leaders of the Fair Play Committee were convicted of conspiracy to violate the Selective Service Act and sentenced to four years in federal prison. While the Poston concentration camp in Arizona had the highest number of resisters of any camp, at 106, Heart Mountain&#x27;s 85 resisters from a much smaller population gave it the highest overall rate of draft resistance.

Although Heart Mountain is remembered primarily for its organized resistance to the draft, approximately 650 Nisei joined the U.S. Army from this camp, either volunteering or accepting their conscription into the legendary 100th Infantry Battalion, the famed 442nd RCT and MIS. Fifteen of these young men were killed in action and fifty-two wounded. Joe Hayashi and James K. Okubo posthumously received the Medal of Honor for valor in battle, making Heart Mountain the only one of the ten WRA camps to have more than one Medal of Honor recipient. In late 1944, camp inmates erected an Honor Roll in front of the administration building listing the names of these soldiers. This wooden tribute stood for five decades, until the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation removed the deteriorating display for preservation. An accurate reproduction, completed in 2003, now stands in place of the original. The original Honor Roll is being conserved and restored.

===The end of the war===
By the time Roosevelt rescinded Executive Order 9066 in December 1944 and announced that Japanese Americans could begin returning to the West Coast the following month, many had already left camp, most for outside work or to attend college in the Midwest or East Coast. Beginning in January 1945, internees began to leave Heart Mountain for the West Coast, provided by administrators with $25 and a one-way train ticket to the location they had been picked up from three years earlier. However, even with the earlier group of resettlers, only 2,000 had left by June 1945, and the 7,000 still remaining within Heart Mountain for the most part represented those who were too young or too old to easily relocate. Many Japanese Americans, barred from owning their pre-war homes and farms by discriminatory legislation, had nothing to return to on the West Coast, but they were prohibited from homesteading in Wyoming by an alien land law passed by the state legislature in 1943 (a law that remained in place until 2001). Another Wyoming law excluding them from voting further discouraged Japanese Americans from staying in Wyoming. The last trainload of former inmates left Heart Mountain on November 10, 1945.

==Preservation and remembrance==
After Heart Mountain closed, most of the land, barracks and agricultural equipment were sold to farmers and former servicemen, who established homesteads on and around the camp site. The Heart Mountain Irrigation Project continued after the war, and much of the camp&#x27;s surrounding acreage was tilled for irrigation agriculture. Remnants of the hospital complex (including foundations and 3 buildings), a Heart Mountain High School storage shed, a root cellar, the Honor Roll World War II Memorial and a portion of a remodeled barrack are the only buildings still standing today.

The Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation, established in 1996, has worked to preserve and memorialize the site and events, educate the general public about the Japanese American incarceration, and support research about the incarceration so that future generations can understand the lessons of the Japanese American incarceration experience. The Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation is overseen by a 16-member Board of Directors and is led by the Chair, Shirley Ann Higuchi, a descendant of former internees. The board also includes former internees, scholars, and other professionals working on the local and national level. The Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation gained National Historic Landmark status for the site in 2007 and on August 20, 2011, opened the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center. The Center features a permanent exhibit that provides an overview of the history of the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans and the background of anti-Asian prejudice in America that led to it. Along with additional rotating exhibits, these photographs, artifacts and oral histories explore the incarceration experience, constitutional and civil rights issues, and the broader issues of race and social justice in America. Visitors can also participate in a walking tour of the site and its remaining structures. Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta and retired U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson, who met as Boy Scouts on opposite sides of the barbed wire fence surrounding the Heart Mountain compound, were Honorary Advisors to the Foundation.

The Foundation hosts an annual pilgrimage at Heart Mountain, the first of which coincided with the Interpretive Center&#x27;s 2011 opening.

==Terminology==

Since the end of World War II, there has been debate over the terminology used to refer to Heart Mountain and the other camps in which Japanese Americans were incarcerated by the United States Government during the war. Heart Mountain has been referred to as a &quot;War Relocation Center,&quot; &quot;relocation camp,&quot; &quot;relocation center,&quot; &quot;internment camp,&quot; &quot;incarceration camp,&quot; and &quot;concentration camp,&quot; and the controversy over which term is the most accurate and appropriate continues to the present day. Scholars and activists have criticized &quot;internment camp&quot; for being a minimizing, misleading euphemism, as Japanese Americans were not there for protection, performed forced labor, and could not leave.

<text>Yo soy Betty, la fea (English: I am Betty, the Ugly one), often referred to simply as Betty, la fea, is a Colombian telenovela created by Fernando Gaitán. It aired from 25 October 1999 to 8 May 2001 on RCN. Ana María Orozco stars as the titular character, alongside Jorge Enrique Abello, Natalia Ramírez, Lorna Cepeda, Luis Mesa and Julián Arango.

It is the first telenovela to have been remade worldwide and has been regarded as bringing the telenovela to new levels of success. The story&#x27;s appeal to global audiences has been credited to it being centered around the life of an unattractive character rather than that of a typical attractive character.

==Plot==
Taking place mainly in Bogotá, Colombia, &quot;Yo soy Betty, la fea&quot; is essentially a Cinderella comedy about the rise of poor, ugly &#x27;Betty&#x27; Beatriz Pinzón Solano and the fall of rich, handsome Armando Mendoza. Armando is a very incompetent playboy with a scheme to turn a huge profit as the new president of Eco Moda, a famous clothing manufacturing company, alongside the new vice-president Mario Calderon. However, his scheme is doomed for his faulty mathematics. Betty, his secretary (and economics wizard), is in love with him despite his engagement to Marcela Valencia. She helps Armando deceive the board of directors as he loses money and brings the company to ruin. The story has three movements: 1) Armando&#x27;s foolish destruction of Eco Moda, 2) Betty&#x27;s flight from the disgrace and her temporary new job in Cartagena where she undergoes an emotional and physical transformation, and 3) Betty&#x27;s return to Eco Moda, where she is installed as new CEO.

==Cast==
===Main===

*Ana María Orozco as Beatriz &quot;Betty&quot; Aurora Pinzón Solano; A rather uncouth woman but very skilled in economics with a good CV. Later becomes a CEO assistant and economist. She is the pride of her parents. She is in love with Armando Mendoza.
*Jorge Enrique Abello as Armando Mendoza Sáenz; Eco Moda&#x27;s CEO. A somewhat irresponsible playboy with only basic knowledge in industrial engineering who presents a risky and ambitious proposal with which he wins the presidency of Eco Moda. When he manages it, it brings the company to the brink of bankruptcy, thus Betty steps in to help. Despite being a completely superficial playboy, he sincerely falls in love with Betty, seeing beyond her ugliness.
*Natalia Ramírez as Marcela Valencia; Armando&#x27;s fiancée and Eco Moda&#x27;s stockholder and retail manager. Despite her dislike of Betty, she is not actually a bad person, but a woman full of pride, classism and lacks dignity, and she loves Armando. She later willingly gives up on him as she discovers he actually loves Betty.
*Lorna Cepeda as Patricia Fernández; Marcela&#x27;s best friend and secretary. A divorced woman, refined and superficial, as well as materialist, she is looking for a rich husband. Armando hates her because she is a dumb blonde and knows that Marcela wants her as Armando&#x27;s secretary to watch over his infidelities.
*Luis Mesa as Daniel Felipe Valencia; Marcela&#x27;s brother. Male chauvinist and arrogant, shareholder of Eco Moda. He rivals and dislikes Armando and unlike him, he is realistic and the only one worried about his company. He has an affair with Patricia.
*Julián Arango as Hugo Lombardi; Eco Moda&#x27;s fashion designer. Openly gay and arrogant, who despises ugliness. He dislikes almost everyone at Eco Moda and especially hates Eco Moda&#x27;s secretaries, whom he nicknames &#x27;The Ugly Cuartel&#x27;, with the exception of Inesita who is perhaps the only person he actually cares for. Arango was married to Ana María Orozco during the recording.
*Ricardo Vélez as Mario Calderón; Armando&#x27;s best friend and Eco Moda&#x27;s commercial vice president. A staunch playboy, inveterate enemy of commitments and fatherhood, he is strangely enough a rather neutral figure.
*Mario Duarte as Nicolás Flaminio Mora Cifuentes; Betty&#x27;s best friend and economist. Like Betty, he is unattractive and highly intelligent. He is in love with Patricia and boasts of his position as president of Terramoda. Patricia softens to him but only because of his newfound wealth.
*Kepa Amuchastegui as Roberto Mendoza; Armando&#x27;s father, founder of the company. Kind hearted and intelligent. 
*Talú Quintero as Margarita Sáenz de Mendoza; Armando&#x27;s mother.

*Dora Cadavid as Inés &quot;Inesita&quot; Ramírez de Muriel; seamstress, member of the cuartel. Kind and wise, she is the elderly assistant to Hugo Lombardi who loves her like a mother. She is the voice of reason and is as sane as Betty in the cuartel.

She has a feud with Jenny, the current romantic partner of her ex-husband. Formerly Gustavo Olarte&#x27;s secretary and after his dismissal, she temporarily becomes Betty&#x27;s secretary.
*Luces Velásquez as Bertha Muñoz de González; Gutiérrez&#x27; secretary, somewhat gluttonous, member of the cuartel. She is married with children and deeply loves her husband. She occasionally imitates Patricia&#x27;s way of dressing.
*Marcela Posada as Sandra Patiño; Calderón&#x27;s secretary, member of the cuartel. Known for her height. She is usually aggressive with whoever is the enemy of the cuartel.
*María Eugenía Arboleda as Mariana Valdés; Marcela&#x27;s secretary, member of the cuartel. Known for reading tarot, she is very optimistic and a lover of rumba. 
*Celmira Luzardo as Catalina Ángel; Betty&#x27;s &quot;fairy godmother&quot; and public relationist. A dignified, loquacious, eloquent and recognized woman.
*Alberto León Jaramillo as Saúl Gutiérrez; Eco Moda&#x27;s Director of Human Resources. Pedantic and smug man who also despises ugliness and is known for his &quot;Spanglish&quot;. He usually sides with whoever is in charge.

<text>Robert Raynolds McMath (May 11, 1891 – January 2, 1962) was an American solar astronomer.

McMath was a bridge engineer, businessman, and astronomer. His father, Francis C. McMath, had made a fortune as a bridge builder. They both had a keen interest in amateur astronomy. So in 1922, the McMaths, along with Judge Henry S. Hulbert founded the McMath–Hulbert Observatory in Lake Angelus, Michigan. It was deeded to the University of Michigan in 1931, McMath served as the director of the McMath–Hulbert Observatory until 1961.

In 1932, McMath extended the functionality of the spectroheliograph so that it could record motion pictures of the Sun. This machine is known as a &quot;spectroheliokinematograph&quot;; with it, he took astonishing moving pictures of solar storms, showing features on the Sun&#x27;s surface that lasted from seconds to days.

In 1933, he and his father received the Franklin Institute&#x27;s John Price Wetherill Medal. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1942. In 1958, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences.

McMath was an adviser to the National Science Foundation in its early years and he chaired the panel that advised NSF on the need for a national observatory. A site on Kitt Peak, Arizona was finally chosen for the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO). McMath, along with the eminent astronomer Keith Pierce, built a new, larger solar telescope on Kitt Peak called the McMath–Pierce solar telescope. McMath served as the first president of Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) from 1957 to 1958, and thereafter as chairman of the AURA board.

<doc id="1090409" wikidata="Q1055873" url="?curid=1090409" title="Liam Clancy">
<text>Liam Clancy (; 2 September 1935 – 4 December 2009) was an Irish folk singer from Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary. He was the youngest member of the influential folk group the Clancy Brothers, regarded as Ireland&#x27;s first pop stars. They achieved global sales of millions and appeared in sold-out concerts at such prominent venues as Carnegie Hall and the Royal Albert Hall.

Liam was generally considered to be the group&#x27;s most powerful vocalist. Bob Dylan regarded him as the greatest ballad singer ever. In 1976, as part of the duo Makem and Clancy, he had a number one hit in Ireland with the anti-war song &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; (written by Scots-Australian Eric Bogle). Upon his death &quot;The Irish Times&quot; said his legacy was secured.

==Early life==
He was born at Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland on 2 September 1935, the ninth and youngest surviving child (two died in childhood) of Robert Joseph Clancy and Joanna McGrath. As a child, he was known as William or Willie, named after his mother&#x27;s hero Willie Doyle. He later acquired the nickname &#x27;Liam&#x27; from Cyril Cusack as &#x27;William&#x27; was &quot;too English&quot;. The Clancys were a republican family with Liam&#x27;s uncle Peter McGrath serving under Dan Breen in a flying column during the Irish War of Independence. He displayed an artistic disposition at an early age, while growing up in Carrick-on-Suir. The first song he learned was &quot;The Croppy Boy&quot;. He received a Christian Brothers education before taking a job as an insurance man in Dublin. Whilst there he also took night classes at the National College of Art and Design.

Still in his teens, Liam explored writing and painting, though he was particularly drawn to the theatre. In his early performing days, he began to call himself Liam. Before he was twenty years old, Liam had founded the local dramatic society now called &quot;Brewery Lane Theatre and Arts Centre&quot;, and had produced, directed, set-directed, and starred in John Millington Synge&#x27;s &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;. Liam also performed at the renowned Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. He encountered Diane Hamilton Guggenheim when she came to his hometown to visit his mother, and set off on a tour of Ireland alongside her. During her 1955 trip to Keady, Clancy encountered Tommy Makem for the first time. He later moved to New York City and referred to Greenwich Village as &quot;the island for people escaped from repressed backgrounds&quot;.

==Singing career==
===Clancy Brothers===
Liam Clancy began singing with his brothers, Paddy and Tom Clancy, at fund-raising events for the Cherry Lane Theatre and the Guthrie benefits. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem began recording on Paddy Clancy&#x27;s Tradition Records label in the late 1950s. Liam Clancy played guitar in addition to singing and also recorded several solo albums. They recorded their seminal &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot; album in 1959, giving live performances in the American cities Boston, Chicago and New York. A record-breaking sixteen-minute-long performance on American TV&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on 17 March 1961 launched the group into stardom. They were supposed to only play two songs but the main act cancelled at short notice. There were international tours, which included performances at Carnegie Hall (a sell-out in 1962) and the Royal Albert Hall. Their trademark attire was Aran geansaí—these were sent across the water by Mrs. Clancy for her sons to wear against the unforgiving American climate. The quartet recorded numerous albums for Columbia Records and enjoyed great success during the 1960s folk revival. Liam was a close friend of Bob Dylan when they both were going out with two sisters in New York. He performed live for United States President John F. Kennedy.

In 1964, thirty per cent of all albums sold in Ireland were Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem records. Although better known for their full-length albums, the Clancy Brothers&#x27; single, &quot;The Leaving of Liverpool&quot; (from the album, &quot;The First Hurrah!&quot;), which featured Liam in the lead, reached the number six spot on the Irish charts in 1964. Liam played the guitar in almost all the recordings of the Clancy Brothers, and he took lead vocals in many songs, including &quot;The Wild Rover&quot;, &quot;The Shoals of Herring&quot;, &quot;Port Lairge&quot;, &quot;The Juice of the Barley&quot;, &quot;The Patriot Game&quot;, &quot;The Gallant Forty Twa&quot;, &quot;The Jolly Tinker&quot;, &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Peggy Gordon&quot;, &quot;Old Maid in the Garrett&quot;, and &quot;The Parting Glass&quot;, which closed every Clancy Brothers concert.

Liam Clancy was the last surviving member of the original Clancy Brothers. Tom Clancy died on 7 November 1990, Patrick Clancy died on 11 November 1998, and Tommy Makem died on 1 August 2007. Bobby Clancy, who had joined the group in 1969, died on 6 September 2002. Liam said of his status as the last of the brothers: &quot;There was always a pecking order, especially when you&#x27;re working with family. But they all died off, and I got to the top of the pecking order, with nobody looking over my shoulder. There&#x27;s a great sense of freedom about that&quot;.

===Solo career===
After The Clancy Brothers split up, Liam had a solo career in Canada, where he made several television performances on the CBC&#x27;s national television variety program, &quot;The Irish Rovers Show&quot; from Vancouver, British Columbia. He had a hit with &quot;The Dutchman&quot; at this time, and he presented his own television show in Calgary, also appearing on the CBC concert series &quot;Summer Evening&quot; in 1976. In 1975, he was booked to play a festival in Cleveland, Ohio, US, where Tommy Makem was also playing. The two played a set together and formed the group Makem and Clancy, performing in numerous concerts and recording several albums together until 1988. The original Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem line-up also got back together in the 1980s for a reunion tour and album. After the death of Tom Clancy in 1990, Liam sang with Paddy and Bobby Clancy and nephew Robbie O&#x27;Connell as part of The Clancy Brothers and Robbie O&#x27;Connell. He also performed alongside his Fayreweather Band and the Phil Coulter Orchestra. With Coulter, Clancy had a top four hit single in 1989, &quot;Home from the Sea&quot;.

In later life, Liam maintained a solo career accompanied by musicians Paul Grant and Kevin Evans, whilst also engaging in other pursuits. He lived in Ring, County Waterford at this stage. His home in Waterford was designed by the celebrity architect Duncan Stewart and featured solar panels which were innovative at the time. He subsequently converted his large garage into a recording studio.

He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Limerick in 2001.

In 2001, Liam Clancy published a memoir titled &quot;The Mountain of the Women&quot;. He also was in &quot;No Direction Home&quot;, the 2005 Bob Dylan documentary directed by Martin Scorsese.

In 2006, Clancy was profiled in a two-hour documentary titled &quot;The Legend of Liam Clancy&quot;, produced by Anna Rodgers and John Murray with Crossing the Line Films, and screened on the Irish channel RTÉ. In February 2007, this documentary won the award for best series at the Irish Film and Television Awards in Dublin. In 2008 Liam performed in a filmed concert titled &quot;Liam Clancy and Friends: Live at The Bitter End&quot; which featured the last filmed performance of his friend Odetta, as well as songs from Tom Paxton, Shane MacGowan, Gemma Hayes, Eric Bibb, and Fionn Regan as well as members of Danú.

The same director Alan Gilsenan went on to direct a full-length biography of Liam Clancy, &quot;The Yellow Bittern: The Life and Times of Liam Clancy&quot;. This was released at the 2009 Dublin Film Festival and went on to have a theatrical and DVD release in Ireland the UK. The film includes appearances by Pete Seeger, Jean Ritchie, Bob Dylan, Odetta, and many others as well as much unseen archive such as The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem at Newport Festival. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; praised the film and director Gilsenan who it said had &quot;tracked down an impressive number of secondary sources, and his use of other performers&#x27; music is often inspired&quot;.

His final album &quot;The Wheels of Life&quot; was released in 2009. It included duets with Mary Black and Gemma Hayes as well as songs by Tom Paxton and Donovan.

Liam was an ardent proponent of political views and often outspoken on matters of social injustice until his death. He criticised both Gulf Wars and the grim, harsh economic climate which gripped Ireland during his last months.

Clancy told &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in September 2009 that he was on his &quot;last legs&quot;. He had already given his final performance, at the National Concert Hall the previous May, during which he recited the Dylan Thomas poem &quot;And death shall have no dominion&quot;. He was unable to perform a full-length show on the closing night of a two-night sold-out run but put in a 40-minute appearance nonetheless. His manager described it as &quot;...a very profound moment. He expressed his fear of dying, but he did it with great dignity&quot;.

==Death==
Liam Clancy died from pulmonary fibrosis on 4 December 2009, in Bon Secours Hospital in Cork, Ireland. His brother Bobby died of the same disease seven years previously. He was buried in the new cemetery in An Rinn, County Waterford, where he spent the last years of his life, owning a successful recording studio. He was survived by his wife, Kim, and their four children: Eben, Siobhán, Fiona and Donal, as well as three previous children: Sean, Andrew and Anya.

His son Eben was in the process of coming over from the United Kingdom and he had a last telephone chat with his son Donal who was in the middle of a tour of California. The other three sat beside him as he died. Liam had intended to give another interview at the time but succumbed to the disease.

The leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny, mourned the loss of a &quot;brilliant musician&quot;. Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Martin Cullen said, &quot;Liam Clancy was a nationally and internationally renowned folk singer and was an example of an absolutely dedicated artistic craftsman. This generous and life-giving person enriched all of our lives with memorable songs and was part of the fabric of Ireland&#x27;s proud traditional music culture&quot;. Alan Gilsenan described the death as the &quot;end of an era&quot;.

Radio disc jockeys in New York paid tribute to the man who, according to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;played a major role in defining how Americans heard Irish popular music over the last half century&quot;, with one DJ saying The Clancy Brothers had &quot;broke down a wall that was long overdue&quot;. Christy Moore, on a prescheduled appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; aired live on the night of Liam&#x27;s death, said, &quot;I would have been listening to Radio Luxembourg and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as a young fellow and then I got to hear of the Clancy brothers, when I was 16 I came to Dublin to hear them in a concert. It was about 1962, I think it was the Olympia, it was the most exciting concert I had ever attended. It was Irish, it was rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, it was funky and it was even sexy&quot;.

Clancy&#x27;s mid-day funeral at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Dungarvan, on 7 December was attended by hundreds of mourners, including both the Aides de Camp of the Taoiseach and President of Ireland, Minister Cullen and various musicians and artists. He was later buried in An Rinn.

<doc id="1090456" wikidata="Q1756358" url="?curid=1090456" title="Pirapora">
<text>Pirapora is a municipality in northcentral Minas Gerais in Brazil. The population is 56,640 (2020 est.) in an area of 550 km². The name Pirapora comes from the Tupi words for &quot;fish&quot; + &quot;jump&quot;, referring to the piracema season when a mass migration of fishes ascends the São Francisco River to spawn.

==Location==
Pirapora belongs to its own statistical microregion. The elevation of the municipal seat is 472 meters. It became a municipality in 1912. This municipality is located on the right bank of the São Francisco River and is 340 km from the state capital.

Neighboring municipalities are: Lagoa Grande, Coromandel, Guarda-Mor, Lagamar and Paracatu. There are two districts, besides the municipal seat: Claro de Minas, 12 km. distant, and Vazamor, 32 km. distant.

==Microregion of Pirapora==

The statistical microregion of Pirapora includes 9 cities: Buritizeiro, Várzea da Palma, Ibiaí, Jequitaí, São Romão, Lassance, Riachinho, Santa Fé de Minas and Lagoa dos Patos. It has an area of 23,111 km2 and a population of approximately 150,000 inhabitants.

==History==
The city is located on the right bank of the great São Francisco River, the longest river to flow entirely inside Brazilian territory. Its history goes back to the colonial period of the bandeirantes and the gold panhandlers who followed the river upstream, arrived at the rapids of Pirapora and founded the settlement of São Gonçalo das Tabocas. In 1911 the small Arraial de São Gonçalo de Pirapora became the seat of a municipality and its name was shortened to Pirapora. Its street plan was laid out in the form of a chess set, inspired by the new capital of Belo Horizonte, and the streets were given names of Brazilian states.

There are highway connections with the main federal highway, the BR 040, to the west. In 1910 the railroad came up from the south and reached Pirapora, with a bridge (694 m) being built across the river. There were plans to extend the line to the coast. At the end of the nineteen seventies the line was deactivated, but the bridge and the rails still remain.

Today the river has lost its economic importance and is mainly used by tourist boats that attempt to recreate the spirit of the past, when Mississippi style riverboats were used to go as far as Juazeiro in Bahia. These boats used charcoal, which contributed to the disappearance of the vegetation along the river. One of the old paddle wheel steamboats, the Benjamim Guimarães, can still be seen anchored in front of the city and is a major tourist site.

==Economy==
The main economic activities are industry, cattle raising, farming (both extensive mechanized and subsistence), goods and services, and tourism. The GDP for 2005 was R$662,985,000. In the rural area there were 605 farms and a total agricultural area of 57,000 hectares, of which 38,000 ha. were planted, 14,000 were in natural pasture, and 13,000 ha. were in woodland or forest. 2,800 people were dependent on farming. 107 of the farms had tractors. In 2006 there were 9,600 head of cattle. With irrigation Pirapora has become a major producer of tropical fruits, growing eating grapes, papaya, mangoes, cantaloupe, and guava. There is also production on a smaller scale of corn, beans, rice, manioc, tomatoes, lettuce, and bananas.

According to the city government site, Pirapora is the second most important city in the north of Minas, after Montes Claros, in industrial output. There is an industrial park where several small and medium industries are installed. Iron silicon, metallic silicon, and textiles are produced.

==Health and education==
In 2005 there were 39 health establishments—25 public and 14 private. There was 01 public hospital and 02 private hospitals. The number of hospital beds was 133. The Centro Regional de Saúde da Visão is a public clinic that specializes in eye surgery and attracts patients from all over the north of Minas Gerais.

In 2007 there were three institutes of higher learning in the city: Instituto Educacional Santo Agostinho (private), União de Ensino de Minas Gerais Ltda (private), and UNIMONTES-Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros (public).

The score on the Municipal Human Development Index was 0.758. Pirapora was ranked 235 out of 853 municipalities in the state, with Poços de Caldas in first place with 0.841 and Setubinha in last place with 0.568.

<doc id="1090463" wikidata="Q586678" url="?curid=1090463" title="Gustavus Fox">
<text>Gustavus Vasa Fox (June 13, 1821 – October 29, 1883) was an officer of the United States Navy, who served during the Mexican–American War, and as the first Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the Civil War.

==Life and career==
Fox was born at Saugus, Massachusetts, and his parents named him after Swedish King Gustav I, also known as Gustav (or Gustavus) Vasa. His parents, Dr. Jesse Fox and Olivia Fox (née Flint) were not Swedish American, and may have been inspired to name their son after Gustav I by Henry Brooke&#x27;s popular play &quot;Gustavus Vasa: The Deliveror Of His Country&quot;. Fox attended Lowell High School Lowell, Massachusetts from 1836 to 1838.

On January 12, 1838, Fox was appointed midshipman. During the Mexican–American War, he served in the brig in the squadron of Commodore Matthew Perry, and took part in the capture of Tabasco, Mexico, on January 14–16, 1847. He later commanded several mail steamers. He resigned from the Navy on July 30, 1856, and engaged in the manufacture of woolen materials.

At the start of the American Civil War he volunteered for service. President Abraham Lincoln gave him a temporary appointment in the Navy and sent him in the steamer &quot;Baltic&quot; to the relief of Fort Sumter. Fox could not relieve the fort before Confederate bombardment forced its surrender, but afterwards he brought away the garrison.

On August 1, 1861, Lincoln appointed him Assistant Secretary of the Navy, an office which he held until the close of the Civil War. In 1866, he was sent on a special mission to Russia; he conveyed the congratulations of the President to Tsar Alexander II upon his escape from assassination. His voyage was made in the monitor , which was the first vessel of this class to cross the Atlantic. They were accompanied by .

In 1882 he published a paper suggesting that Samana Cay in the Bahamas was Guanahani, or San Salvador, the first island Christopher Columbus reached in his discovery of the Americas. Little attention was paid to his paper until 1986, when the National Geographic Society also concluded that Samana Cay was San Salvador.

He died at Lowell, Massachusetts, aged 62.

==Tributes and legacy==
Three ships of the US Navy – TB-13, DD-234 and CG-33 – have been named in his memory.

==In popular culture==
Fox is one of the primary viewpoint characters in novelist Harry Harrison&#x27;s alternate history &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; trilogy.

<doc id="1090467" wikidata="Q6141204" url="?curid=1090467" title="USS Peto">
<text>USS &quot;Peto&quot; (SS-265), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the peto, a sharp-nosed tropical fish of the mackerel family.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Peto&quot; was laid down on 18 June 1941 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin; launched on 30 April 1942 sponsored by Mrs. E. A. Lofquist; and commissioned on 21 November 1942, Lieutenant Commander William T. Nelson in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Late in December 1942, &quot;Peto&quot; decommissioned, was loaded on a barge, and departed Manitowoc for New Orleans, Louisiana, the first submarine to traverse the mid-western waterways to reach New Orleans and the sea from the building yards. This was done because the Chain of Rocks Waterway as well as some of the passages near Chicago were only deep, whereas the minimum draft of the submarine was . &quot;Peto&quot; recommissioned, completed fitting out and shakedown, transited the Panama Canal, and arrived at Brisbane, Australia, on 14 March 1943.

====First war patrol====
&quot;Peto&quot; departed Brisbane for her first war patrol on 2 April 1943. She reconnoitered Greenwich Island for shipping on 13 April without finding any targets. That night she proceeded toward the equator to cover the Truk-Kavieng shipping route, arriving on station the next day. A southbound Truk-Rabaul convoy came into view on the morning of 17 April, consisting of two destroyers, two medium cargo ships, and one small auxiliary ship. However, before &quot;Peto&quot; attacked, the trailing destroyer detected her and forced her to dive. She withstood nine depth charges without damage.

On 5 May, she made a night attack conducted by sound and radar alone, firing three torpedoes at a target for one possible hit. After patrolling off Cape Oxford on New Britain, &quot;Peto&quot; headed for Brisbane on 20 May 1943.

====Second war patrol====
&quot;Peto&quot; departed on her second war patrol on 10 June 1943. On 29 June, she fired two torpedoes at a small auxiliary. One torpedo hit near the bow, breaking the ship in two. On 7 July, she sighted an eastbound tanker similar to &quot;Nippon Maru&quot; with two escorting destroyers. &quot;Peto&quot; maneuvered and fired three torpedoes; two hits causing severe damage. She returned to Brisbane on 4 August 1943.

====Third war patrol====
On 1 September 1943, &quot;Peto&quot; set out on her third war patrol, assigned a patrol area north of the Bismarck Archipelago. After reconnoitering Nauru Harbor, she patrolled the route between Truk and Nauru for five days without contact. On 9 September, an Allied maritime patrol aircraft mistakenly attacked her with a depth charge north-northeast of Buka on Bougainville Island in the Solomon Islands at . The depth charge missed by a wide margin, and &quot;Peto&quot; submerged to and avoided damage.

&quot;Peto&quot; moved to the Truk-Kavieng-Rabaul traffic routes on 20 September, and two days later, sighted five escorted ships headed toward Rabaul. She lost her attack chance at the last moment when the Japanese ships made a radical change of course. While &quot;Peto&quot; attempted to close for a night attack, an alert escort only away detected her. The Japanese ship opened fire on her, forcing her to crash-dive.

From 24 to 26 September 1943, &quot;Peto&quot; patrolled off the Admiralty Islands without contacts. On 1 October, she sighted three medium cargo ships with only one submarine chaser as escort, and fired six torpedoes, hitting two of the ships. Post-war investigation revealed that &quot;Peto&quot; sank both &quot;Tonei Maru&quot; and &quot;Kinkasan Maru&quot;. &quot;Peto&quot; returned to Brisbane on 21 October 1943.

====Fourth war patrol====
Underway again on 14 November 1943 to begin her fourth war patrol, &quot;Peto&quot; fueled at Tulagi, and set out for her patrol area on 24 November 1943. On 1 December, she sighted a Japanese convoy consisting of two passenger-cargo vessels with three small escorts. She fired six torpedoes at &quot;Konei Maru&quot;, which broke up and sank. On 9 December, while firing on a ship in a convoy, her target apparently saw the torpedoes coming and turned toward them to avoid being hit. An escort then drove &quot;Peto&quot; down and administered a thorough depth-charging.

Boang Island
On 19 December &quot;Peto&quot; under Commander Nelson received orders to return to Tulagi. On Christmas Day a reconnaissance team of ten US specialists an Australian Coastwatcher (Captain H. Murray) his Sergeant (Bill Dolby) and their four native scouts were embarked. On Boxing Day they sailed arriving off Boang Island part of the Tanga Island Group four days later. That night Captain Murray with four specialists and two scouts were sent into the Island by rubber boat. If they landed unopposed (there was a small enemy garrison of about ten on the Island) they would signal the submarine by flash light signal and the rest of the team would follow them in. The landing was unopposed but the signal to the &quot;Peto&quot; was misinterpreted that something was wrong and the second boat was not sent in. For the next day the specialists conducted the reconnaissance looking for possible sites for airfields, landing sites, etc. Towards the end of the day they became aware that an enemy patrol was after them. Captain Murray set up an ambush that killed some and wounded others who did manage to escape through the jungle. That night despite atrocious weather conditions they made it safely back to the &quot;Peto&quot;. Returning to Tulagi Commander Nelson made Captain Murray an honorary member of the US Submarine Service. In return the team presented the &quot;Peto&quot; with a Japanese machine gun they had captured during the ambush. In turn the machine gun was sent to the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company that had built the &quot;Peto&quot;.

====Fifth war patrol====

On 2 February 1944, &quot;Peto&quot; set course for Tulagi, arriving there on 5 February for fuel before departing the following day for her patrol area. On 10 February &quot;Peto&quot; headed for a rendezvous with the submarine .

On 19 February 1944, &quot;Peto&quot; attacked a merchant ship with three escorts and one of her torpedoes struck home. The target was immediately engulfed in black smoke and her crew heard depth charges in the distance. &quot;Peto&quot; surfaced and found the escorts depth-charging &quot;Cero&quot;″s position. After closing &quot;Cero&quot; slowly, she fired two rounds from her  deck gun at the escorts, and as the escorts returned fire she withdrew, giving &quot;Cero&quot; a chance to escape unharmed.

On 23 February 1944, &quot;Peto&quot; headed for Langemak Bay to refuel and obtain spare parts, arriving there on 27 February. On 1 March, she headed for her patrol area again, and on 3 March made an unsuccessful attack on a Japanese merchant ship. The next day, she fired six torpedoes at a cargo ship and then went deep to listen as escorts were near. The crew heard two hits, followed by a loud, deep explosion. Three minutes later breaking-up noises began, and her crew heard splashes from debris falling in the water for several minutes. The escorts dropped 13 depth charges before giving up. &quot;Peto&quot; had sunk &quot;Kayo Maru&quot;. On 16 March, &quot;Peto&quot; set course for Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where she arrived on 25 March 1944. She departed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the same day, arriving there on 29 March 1944.

====Sixth war patrol====

On 28 April 1944, &quot;Peto&quot;, along with the submarine and an escorting surface warship, departed Pearl Harbor for her patrol area south of Formosa. She departed from Midway on 2 May 1944, with &quot;Perch&quot; and the submarine joining her wolf pack. Arriving in her patrol area, &quot;Peto&quot; began looking for shipping worthy of her torpedoes. She made only six ship contacts during the entire patrol and couldn&#x27;t obtain a favorable attack position on any of them due to Japanese aircraft in the vicinity or shallow water. She returned to Midway on 15 June 1944 and later that day departed for Pearl Harbor with the submarine , arriving on 19 June.

====June–October 1944====
On 21 June 1944, &quot;Peto&quot; headed for San Francisco, California, for major alterations at the Bethlehem Steel Company shipyards. On 29 September 1944, &quot;Peto&quot; headed westward again, reaching Pearl Harbor on 7 October 1944 and arriving at Midway Atoll on 27 October.

====Seventh war patrol====
At Midway, &quot;Peto&quot; joined the submarines and , forming a wolf pack designated Task Group 17.13. The submarines arrived in their assigned patrol area in the Yellow Sea 9 November 1944.

On 12 November 1944, &quot;Peto&quot; heard a loud explosion and saw a large flash. A burning ship with hull down was seen to the east and it was assumed the submarine , which was also in the vicinity, had connected. Peto sent her crew to their battle stations and sent four torpedoes at the nearest ship of a Japanese convoy. Two hits were heard and the target slowed down and dropped back, though it did not stop. &quot;Peto&quot; fired her remaining two forward torpedoes at a second target and swung around to bring her stern torpedo tubes to bear. She fired four torpedoes at the third target. The torpedoes fired from the bow tubes struck home as the leading ship, &quot;Tatsuaki Maru&quot;, blew up and promptly sank. Two hits were heard on the third target, which immediately was engulfed in dense black smoke. &quot;Peto&quot; then scurried for cover, as it was getting light fast. She took her last look at the third target and noted that it was ablaze.

On 18 November 1944, &quot;Peto&quot; made contact with one ship which apparently was lost and without an escort. She fired three torpedoes, the first hitting and setting the target ablaze. The second missed but the third hit and the target blew up and burned much brighter. &quot;Peto&quot; came around for a &quot;coup de grace&quot; but saw that it was unnecessary, as only the stern of &quot;Aisakasan Maru&quot; was above the water, still burning like an inferno. She contacted another Japanese ship, a cargo ship dead in the water with two escorts nearby, and sent three torpedoes streaking after it. One torpedo hit the target and &quot;Chinkai Mara&quot; sank in four minutes. On 29 November, &quot;Peto&quot; attacked a small coastal tanker with her last torpedoes and then headed for home.

&quot;Peto&quot; arrived at Guam on 6 December 1944 and underwent a refit there. She then departed for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 2 January 1945.

====Eighth war patrol====
&quot;Peto&quot; departed Pearl Harbor in company with the submarines , , and on 31 January 1945, topped off with fuel at Saipan on 12 February, and headed for her patrol area the following day. However, she met no suitable targets during her patrol, and she returned to Midway on 9 April 1945.

====Ninth war patrol====
On 4 May 1945, &quot;Peto&quot; got underway for her ninth war patrol. Off Marcus Island on 12 May, she guided Allied pilots to their targets. None of the planes were hit. On 21 May, she closed to the coast of Manus Island and took pictures of Japanese shore installations. The next day, she headed for Guam, arriving there on 19 June 1945.

====Tenth war patrol====

On 14 July 1945, &quot;Peto&quot; stood out of Guam on her tenth and last war patrol. On 24 July, she rescued two pilots from the aircraft carrier , one with gunshot wounds in both legs. On 25 July her guns sank a sampan, and the same day she saved nine more downed aviators. On 10 August she picked up a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm pilot from the aircraft carrier . On 15 August 1945, she was assigned a life guard station to cover air strikes on the Japanese Home Islands, but hostilities with Japan ceased that day.

===Post-World War II===
On 16 August 1945, &quot;Peto&quot; headed for the Panama Canal Zone, arriving on 15 September. On 17 September, she departed for New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving on 21 September 1945.

&quot;Peto&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet and on 25 June 1946 was placed out of commission in reserve, berthed at Naval Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut. She remained in reserve until November 1956, when she became a United States Naval Reserve training submarine for the Eighth Naval District. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1960 and sold on 10 November 1960 for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;Peto&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="1090468" wikidata="Q668255" url="?curid=1090468" title="Breakfast in America">
<text>Breakfast in America is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Supertramp, released on 16 March 1979, by A&amp;M Records. It was recorded in 1978 at The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. It spawned three US &quot;Billboard&quot; hit singles: &quot;The Logical Song&quot; (No. 6), &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot; (No. 15), and &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot; (No. 10). In the UK, &quot;The Logical Song&quot; and the title track were both top 10 hits, the only two the group had in their native country.

At the 22nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1980, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; won two awards for Best Album Package and Best Engineered Non-Classical Recording, as well as nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. It holds an Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certification of quadruple platinum and became Supertramp&#x27;s biggest-selling album, with more than 4 million copies sold in the US and more than 3 million in France (the fourth ever best-selling album). It was No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums Chart for six weeks, until 30 June 1979. The album also hit No. 1 in Norway, Austria, West Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Canada, Australia and France.

==Background==
As with &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments...&quot;, Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson wrote most of their songs separately but conceived the theme for the album jointly. Their original concept was for an album of songs about the relationship and conflicting ideals between Davies and Hodgson themselves, to be titled &quot;Hello Stranger&quot;. Hodgson explained: &quot;We realized that a few of the songs really lent themselves to two people talking to each other and at each other. I could be putting down his way of thinking and he could be challenging my way of seeing life [...] Our ways of life are so different, but I love him. That contrast is what makes the world go &#x27;round and what makes Supertramp go &#x27;round. His beliefs are a challenge to mine and my beliefs are a challenge to his.&quot;

This idea was eventually scrapped in favour of an album of &quot;fun&quot; songs, and though Davies initially wanted to keep the title &quot;Hello Stranger&quot;, he was convinced by Hodgson to change it to &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;. Hodgson commented later: &quot;We chose the title because it was a fun title. It suited the fun feeling of the album.&quot; Due to the title and the explicit satirising of American culture in the cover and three of the songs (&quot;Gone Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; and &quot;Child of Vision&quot;), many listeners interpreted the album as a whole as being a satire of the United States. Supertramp&#x27;s members have all insisted that the repeated references to US culture are purely coincidental and that no such thematic satire was intended. Hodgson has described the misconception as a parallel to how &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; (1974) is often misinterpreted as being a concept album.

&quot;Gone Hollywood&quot; is the opening track of &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;. Written by Rick Davies, the song tells about a person who moves to Los Angeles in hopes of becoming a movie star, but finds it far more difficult than he imagined. He struggles and becomes frustrated, until he ultimately gets his break and becomes &quot;the talk of the Boulevard&quot;. The lyrics were originally more bleak, but under pressure from the other band members, Davies rewrote them to be more optimistic and commercially appealing. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer David Farrell felt that, other than Davies&#x27; lead vocal, the song sounds like a Queen song.

&quot;Child of Vision&quot; is the closing track. Much like &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, it uses a Wurlitzer electric piano as the main instrument. After the lyrical part, the song goes into a long solo played on the grand piano alongside the original melody on the Wurlitzer. The track fades out with a short saxophone solo by John Helliwell. Roger Hodgson has said that the song was written to be an equivalent to &quot;Gone Hollywood&quot;, looking at how Americans live, though he confessed that he had only a limited familiarity with US culture at the time of writing. He also said there is a slight possibility that he subconsciously had Rick Davies in mind while writing the lyrics.

Each song was credited to a single musician on the inner sleeve, but on the central vinyl label was printed &quot;Words and Music by Roger Hodgson &amp; Rick Davies&quot;, combining the two and confusing the issue of composition credit. Roger Hodgson&#x27;s management has described &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;Lord Is It Mine&quot; and &quot;Child of Vision&quot; as &#x27;Roger&#x27;s songs&#x27;; however, this apparently does not mean he necessarily wrote them by himself, for Hodgson has credited Davies with writing the vocal harmony on &quot;The Logical Song&quot;. Davies has referred to &quot;The five songs that I did on Breakfast&quot;, but has not specified which ones.

==Recording==
The album went through two rounds of demos. The first were home demos, each of which consisted of the chief songwriter (either Rick Davies or Roger Hodgson) singing and playing either acoustic piano or Wurlitzer electric piano. The second were eight-track demos recorded at Southcombe Studios in Burbank, California during late April and early May 1978. It was in recording these demos that the band worked out the backing track arrangements for all the songs (with the exception of &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot;) and determined the order in which they would appear on the album.

In order to avoid spending a lot of time on mixing, the band and their production team devoted a week to experimenting with different sound setups until they found the perfect arrangement. The effort proved to be wasted, as the engineering team would end up spending more than two extremely stressful months searching for the right mix, and were finished after that length of time only because the deadline had arrived, not because they felt at all satisfied with the results.

Tensions between Hodgson and Davies were reportedly almost non-existent on the album. Engineer Peter Henderson recalled: &quot;They got along fantastically well and everyone was really happy. There was a very, very good vibe and I think everyone was really buoyed up by the recordings and A&amp;M&#x27;s response to them.&quot; Hodgson contested this, saying that he and Davies had increasingly different lifestyles, and that he felt that Davies disliked many of his songs and kept quiet about his displeasure only because he sensed that he would be voted down. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist Harry Doherty offered a third take on the duo&#x27;s interactions during the album sessions: &quot;In three days with the band, I don&#x27;t think I saw Davies and Hodgson converse once, other than to exchange courteous greetings.&quot;

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s front cover resembles an overlook of Manhattan through an aeroplane window. It was designed by Mike Doud and Mick Haggerty. The image depicts Kate Murtagh, dressed as a waitress named &quot;Libby&quot; from a diner, as a Statue of Liberty figure holding up a glass of orange juice on a small plate in one hand (in place of the torch on the Statue), and a foldable restaurant menu in the other hand, on which &#x27;Breakfast in America&#x27; is written. The background features the Financial District within the New York City borough of Manhattan, with the Lower Manhattan skyline represented through a cornflake box, ashtray, cutlery (for the wharfs), pancake syrup bottles, egg crates, salt and pepper shakers, coffee mugs, ketchup and mustard bottles, etc., all spray-painted white. The twin World Trade Center towers appear as two stacks of boxes, and the plate of breakfast represents The Battery, the departure point for the Staten Island Ferry. The back cover photo, depicting the band members having breakfast while reading their respective hometown newspapers, was taken at a diner called Bert&#x27;s Mad House.

&quot;Breakfast in America&quot; won the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, defeating albums by Talking Heads and Led Zeppelin, among others.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Breakfast in America&quot; topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for six weeks and became Supertramp&#x27;s biggest selling album, while producing four hit singles: &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;, &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot; and the title track. In Japan, the album reached number 1 on the Music Labo chart in 1979. &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; would become Supertramp&#x27;s most popular album. By the 1990s, it had sold in excess of 18 million copies worldwide. By 2010, the album had sold well over 20 million copies.

==Critical reception==
In a positive review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, music critic Stephen Holden viewed &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; as an improvement over the &quot;swatches of meandering, Genesis-like esoterica&quot; on Supertramp&#x27;s previous albums, and called it &quot;a textbook-perfect album of post-Beatles, keyboard-centered English art rock that strikes the shrewdest possible balance between quasi-symphonic classicism and rock &amp; roll ... the songs here are extraordinarily melodic and concisely structured, reflecting these musicians&#x27; saturation in American pop since their move to Los Angeles in 1977.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was less impressed, saying that the &quot;hooky album&quot; evokes &quot;random grunts of pleasure&quot; but lacks emotional substance because of &quot;glib&quot; lyrics and no &quot;vocal personality (as opposed to accurate singing) and rhythmic thrust (as opposed to a beat)&quot;.

Colin Larkin, writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2006), said that the &quot;faultless&quot; album &quot;elevated&quot; Supertramp to &quot;rock&#x27;s first division&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album&#x27;s &quot;tightly written, catchy, well-constructed pop songs&quot; and described it as the band&#x27;s &quot;high-water mark&quot;. John Doran of BBC Music said that the songwriting has an &quot;unbeatable quality&quot; and asserted that &quot;any of the ten tracks could have been hit singles&quot;. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Tyler Fisher said that its singles are mostly the highlights because of their &quot;catchy hooks&quot;, and found the ballads &quot;absolutely terrible&quot;. Rob Sheffield, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), also felt that its &quot;nice moments&quot; were the highlights, including &quot;the jolly &#x27;Take the Long Way Home,&#x27; the adjectively crazed &#x27;Logical Song,&#x27; [and] &#x27;Goodbye Stranger.&#x27;&quot; William Pinfold of &quot;Record Collector&quot; considered the album &quot;a classic example of flawlessly-played and -produced late 70s transatlantic soft rock&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
In the 1987 edition of &quot;The World Critics List&quot;, music historian Joel Whitburn ranked &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; the fourth-greatest album of all time. In the 1994 edition of The Guinness All Time Top 1000 Albums, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; was voted No. 207 in the all-time greatest rock and pop albums, and it was voted the 69th-greatest British rock album of all time in a 2006 &quot;Classic Rock&quot; industry poll. Triple M listeners voted the album No. 43 in the &quot;100 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Recognising the band&#x27;s disfavour among music critics during their career, &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; second on its &quot;Records it&#x27;s OK to Love&quot; list in 2006.
In 2000 it was voted No. 294 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

&quot;The Logical Song&quot; won the 1979 Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Best Song Musically and Lyrically&quot;.

<text>Going-to-the-Sun Road is a scenic mountain road in the Rocky Mountains of the western United States, in Glacier National Park in Montana. The Sun Road, as it is sometimes abbreviated in National Park Service documents, is the only road that traverses the park, crossing the Continental Divide through Logan Pass at an elevation of 6,646 feet (2,026 m), which is the highest point on the road. Construction began in 1921 and was completed in 1932 with formal dedication in the following summer on July 15, 1933. Prior to the construction of the road, visitors would need to spend several days traveling through the central part of the park, an area which can now be traversed within a few hours, excluding any stops for sightseeing or construction.

The road is the first to have been registered in all of the following categories: National Historic Place, National Historic Landmark and Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The road is approximately 50 miles (80 km) long and spans the width of the park between the east and west entrance stations. The National Historic Landmark Nomination records a slightly shorter distance of 48.7 miles which is measured from the first main intersection just outside the park&#x27;s west entrance to Divide Creek in St. Mary, Montana on the east side of the park.

==Name==
The road is named after Going-to-the-Sun Mountain which dominates the eastbound view beyond Logan Pass. One Native American legend concerns the deity Sour Spirit who came down from the sun to teach the Blackfeet the basics of hunting. While returning to the sun, an image of Sour Spirit was placed on the mountain as an inspiration for the Blackfeet. Another story has suggested that a late-19th-century Euro-American explorer provided the mountain&#x27;s name and the legend.

==Design==

Going-to-the-Sun Road, also known as Glacier Route 1 Road, is notable as one of the first National Park Service projects specifically intended to accommodate the automobile-borne tourist. The road was first conceived by superintendent George Goodwin in 1917, who became the chief engineer of the Park Service the following year. As chief engineer, the new road became Goodwin&#x27;s primary project, and construction began in 1921.

As the project proceeded, Goodwin lost influence with National Park Service director Stephen Mather, who favored landscape architect Thomas Chalmers Vint&#x27;s alternative routing of the upper portion of the road along the Garden Wall escarpment. Vint&#x27;s alignment reduced both switchbacks and the road&#x27;s visual impact, at increased cost. With Goodwin&#x27;s resignation, Vint&#x27;s proposal became the preferred alignment. The entire project was finally opened from end to end in 1933, at a cost of $2.5 million.

The western terminus of the road is at U.S. Route 2 in West Glacier, Montana. The eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 89 in St. Mary.

The two-lane Going-to-the-Sun Road is quite narrow and winding, with hairpin turns, especially west of Logan Pass. Consequently, vehicle lengths over the highest portions of the roadway are limited to no longer than and no wider than between Avalanche Creek and Rising Sun picnic areas which are located many miles below Logan Pass, on the west and east sides of the pass, respectively. Vehicles over in height may not have sufficient clearance due to rock overhangs when driving west between Logan Pass and the hairpin turn called the Loop. The speed limits are in the lower elevations and in the steeper and winding alpine sections.

==Repairs==

The road is one of the most difficult roads in North America to snowplow in the spring. Up to of snow can lie on top of Logan Pass, and more just east of the pass where the deepest snowfield has long been referred to as the Big Drift. The road takes about ten weeks to plow, even with equipment that can move 4,000 tons of snow in an hour. The snowplow crew can clear as little as of the road per day. On the east side of the Continental Divide, there are few guardrails due to heavy snows and the resultant late-winter avalanches that have destroyed protective barriers. The road is generally open from early June to mid October, with its latest opening on July 13, 2022, marking the record for the latest opening since the inaugural date of July 15, 1933.

A restoration project by the National Park Service and the Federal Highway Administration has been repairing road damage from many avalanches and rock slides over the years. The repairs, which started in the 1980s and continue to the present day when weather permits, include fixing retaining walls, replacing the original pavement with reinforced concrete, and work on tunnels, bridges, culverts and overlooks.

==Buses==

A fleet of vintage 1930s red buses, modernized in 2001 and called Red Jammers, or simply &quot;Reds&quot;, continue the tradition of offering guided tours along the road. The original bus drivers became affectionately known as &quot;Gear Jammers&quot; or simply &quot;Jammers&quot; since they had to jam the manual gearbox into low to safely negotiate the steepest road sections. Thirty-three of the original buses were rebuilt with flexible-fuel engines which operate mainly on propane but can use gasoline, and with automatic transmissions, making the Jammer name archaic. Modern-style shuttle buses for shorter trips and Blackfeet tour buses operate on the road as well.

==References in popular culture==

Going-to-the-Sun Road is shown in the opening credits of the 1980 film &quot;The Shining&quot;, as aerial flybys of Wild Goose Island and the protagonist&#x27;s car traveling along the north shore of Saint Mary Lake, through the East Side tunnel and onward, going to a mountain resort hotel for his job interview as a winter caretaker. The road is also featured at night at the climax of the sequel adaptation, &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot;, when Danny Torrance returns to the Overlook Hotel with Abra to confront the antagonist Rose The Hat.

The road is also seen briefly in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. As Forrest reminisces with Jenny he remembers running across the U.S. and remarks, &quot;Like that mountain lake. It was so clear, Jenny. It looked like there were two skies, one on top of the other.&quot; The shots in the background are Going-to-the-Sun Road and Saint Mary Lake.

The road is the subject of the song &quot;Going-to-the-Sun Road&quot; by Fleet Foxes, featured on their 2020 album &quot;Shore&quot;.

<doc id="1090476" wikidata="Q5663569" url="?curid=1090476" title="Harpist in the Wind">
<text>Harpist in the Wind is a 1979 fantasy novel by American writer Patricia A. McKillip. It is the concluding book of the Riddle Master trilogy, which has also been published as &quot;Riddle of Stars&quot;. The first UK paperback edition precedes the first US paperback.

==Plot summary==
Morgon of Hed and Raederle of An set out to discover who the shapechangers who pursue them are, and where the High One, the source of the land-law binding the realm together, is hiding. Along the way they are helped by the wizards of the realm, recently released by Morgan from the bonds in which Ghisteslwchlohm had held them, and by the land-heirs/rulers. After confronting Ghisteslwchlohm in the city of Lungold, where the wizard once had ruled, Morgon is imprisoned by the shapechangers within Erlenstar Mountain, as they do not want to kill him. They, the exiled Earth-Masters, need him to reach the High One, who prevents them from exercising full power. He escapes with the help of Raederle and someone who is later revealed to be the High One in disguise. Seeking refuge in the far north, he begins to learn the land-law of each kingdom. Once he has partially learned all of the land-law, Morgon discovers that the High One had journeyed with him as both the harpist Deth and the wizard Yrth. The High One tells Morgon at the top of Wind Plain that he (Morgon) is the High One&#x27;s land-heir. When the High One is killed by Ghisteslwchlohm, now possessed by the shape changers, with Morgon&#x27;s three-starred sword, Morgon learns to shape and/or bind the winds to overcome the Earth-Masters and bring peace to the land; he truly is the High One&#x27;s heir.

==Setting==
In the trilogy, land-law resides with the land-ruler of each of the kingdoms within the realm. Land-rulers are ostensibly aware of all of the entities within their kingdom. They can sense each creature, each plant, each rock. The High One, in McKillip&#x27;s creation, seems to have the same relationship with the entire realm, as he started to bind all of the land-law when he sensed that the Earth-Master Eriel began to gather power for her own ends. When the land-law passes on, the land-heir suddenly becomes aware of everything in his or her kingdom, or in the entire realm.

==Awards and recognition==
* 1980, &quot;Harpist in the Wind&quot; was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel
* 1980, Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel

<doc id="1090481" wikidata="Q2177112" url="?curid=1090481" title="The Secret Life of Walter Mitty">
<text>&quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (1939) is a short story by James Thurber. The most famous of Thurber&#x27;s stories, it first appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on March 18, 1939, and was first collected in his book &quot;My World and Welcome to It&quot; (Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1942). It has since been reprinted in &quot;James Thurber: Writings and Drawings&quot; (The Library of America, 1996, ), is available on-line on the &quot;New Yorker&quot; website, and is one of the most anthologized short stories in American literature. The story is considered one of Thurber&#x27;s &quot;acknowledged masterpieces&quot;. It was made into a 1947 film of the same name, with Danny Kaye in the title role, though the film is very different from the original story. It was also adapted into a 2013 film, which is again very different from the original.

The name Walter Mitty and the derivative word &quot;&quot; have entered the English language, denoting an ineffectual person who spends more time in heroic daydreams than paying attention to the real world, or more seriously, one who intentionally attempts to mislead or convince others that he is something that he is not.

In his autobiography &quot;My First Hundred Years in Hollywood&quot;, Warner Brothers studio head Jack L. Warner described the actor Errol Flynn in the following way: &quot;To the Walter Mittys of the world he was all the heroes in one magnificent, sexy, animal package.&quot;

==Plot==
The short story deals with a vague and mild-mannered man who drives into Waterbury, Connecticut, with his wife for their regular weekly shopping and his wife&#x27;s visit to the beauty parlor. During this time he has five heroic daydream episodes, each inspired by some detail of his mundane surroundings. The first is as a pilot of a U.S. Navy flying boat in a storm, followed by Mrs. Mitty&#x27;s complaint that Mitty is &quot;driving too fast&quot;. As he drives past a hospital, he imagines himself a magnificent surgeon performing a one-of-a-kind surgery. Later, a newsboy shouting about the &quot;Waterbury Trial&quot; begins Mitty&#x27;s third fantasy, as a deadly assassin testifying in a courtroom. While waiting for his wife, he picks up an old copy of &quot;Liberty&quot;, reading &quot;Can Germany Conquer the World Through the Air?&quot;, and begins his fourth daydream, as a Royal Air Force pilot volunteering for a daring suicide mission to bomb an ammunition dump. As the story ends, Mitty stands against a wall, smoking, and imagines himself facing a firing squad, &quot;inscrutable to the last.&quot;

==Analysis==
Mitty is very much a Thurber protagonist, so much so that he has been called &quot;the archetype for dreamy, hapless, Thurber Man&quot;. Like many of his male characters, such as the husband in &quot;The Unicorn in the Garden&quot; and the physically unimposing men Thurber often paired with larger women in his cartoons, Mitty is dominated and put upon by his wife. Like the man who saw the unicorn, he escapes via fantasies. A similar dynamic is found in the Thurber story &quot;The Curb in the Sky&quot;, in which a man starts recounting his own dreams as anecdotes as an attempt to stop his wife from constantly correcting him on the details.

In his 2001 book &quot;The Man Who Was Walter Mitty: The Life and Work of James Thurber&quot; (), author Thomas Fensch suggests that the character was largely based on Thurber himself. This is consistent with Thurber&#x27;s self-described imaginative interpretations of shapes seen with his &quot;two-fifths vision&quot; in his essay &quot;The Admiral on the Wheel&quot;. Neurologist V.S. Ramachandran suggests that Thurber may have had Charles Bonnet syndrome, a neurological condition that causes vivid and bizarre hallucinations in blind people.

Thurber&#x27;s love of wordplay can be seen in his coining of several nonsense terms in the story, including the pseudo-medical jargon &quot;obstreosis of the ductal tract&quot;, &quot;streptothricosis&quot;, and the recurring onomatopoeia of &quot;ta-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa.&quot; The medical nonsense that &quot;coreopsis has set in&quot; uses the name of a flower which sounds vaguely like a horrible medical condition.

==1947 film==

The story was made into a 1947 film starring Danny Kaye as a young daydreaming editor of pulp magazines. The film was adapted for the screen by Ken Englund, Everett Freeman, and Philip Rapp, and directed by Norman Z. McLeod. It was filmed in Technicolor.

Thurber was repeatedly consulted about the film&#x27;s script, but his suggestions were largely ignored by producer Samuel Goldwyn, who had the writers alter the original story to showcase Kaye&#x27;s talents. In a letter to &quot;Life&quot; magazine, Thurber expressed his considerable dissatisfaction with the script, even as Goldwyn insisted in another letter that Thurber approved of it.

A 1947 radio adaptation of the film, with Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo reprising their roles, was performed on &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;. Because the show was a half hour, including commercials, Kaye&#x27;s extraneous routines are minimized, making it more like the original story. Even closer to the original story is a 1944 radio adaptation from &quot;This Is My Best&quot;, with Robert Benchley as the daydreaming Mitty.

==2013 film==
20th Century Fox produced and Ben Stiller directed another film adaptation in 2013, which also differs widely from the book. Stiller stars as Mitty, with Kristen Wiig, Shirley MacLaine, Patton Oswalt, Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, and Sean Penn also appearing in the film. The film was released on December 25, 2013 in the US and in other countries and had a production budget of $90 million.

==Stage adaptations==
&quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; was adapted for the stage by Thurber as part of the 1960 Broadway theater revue &quot;A Thurber Carnival&quot;. The sketch, which closed the show except for &quot;Word Dance Part II&quot;, was nearly identical to the short story, except that at the end he cleverly avoids being shot. The original cast for the sketch was as follows:

*Peggy Cass as Mrs. Mitty
*Tom Ewell as Walter Mitty
*Paul Ford as Mr. Pritchard-Mitford and The Leader
*John McGiver as Dr. Renshaw
*Wynne Miller as Nurse
*Peter Turgeon as Narrator, Lt. Berg, and Dr. Remington
*Charles Braswell as Dr. Benbow

The story was again adapted for the stage in 1964, this time by Joe Manchester. This musical version of &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; depicts Mitty at age 40, tempted by &quot;would-be chanteuse&quot; Willa De Wisp to leave his wife Agnes and really live &quot;the Secret Life&quot;. It features 17 songs, with lyrics by Earl Shuman and music by Leon Carr. The musical opened off-Broadway at the Players Theatre on October 26, 1964, and ran for 96 performances. &quot;Time magazine&quot; referred to the musical&#x27;s plot as having been &quot;boldly extrapolated&quot; from the short story, and called the result &quot;a thoroughly pleasant musical evening&quot;. Columbia Records issued an original cast recording on LP, also dated 1964.

<doc id="1090486" wikidata="Q1769878" url="?curid=1090486" title="Erik Bye">
<text>Erik Erikssønn Bye (March 1, 1926 – October 13, 2004) was a versatile Norwegian-American journalist, artist, author, film actor, folk singer and radio and television personality. He was one of the 20th century&#x27;s most well-known and popular radio and television figures in Norway.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, to Rønnaug (née Dahl) and opera singer Erik Ole Bye, his family moved home to Norway when he was six years old. After a few years in Ringerike they settled in the Nordstrand borough in Oslo, where they took over a bed and breakfast. In his teens, Bye joined the Norwegian resistance movement during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany during World War II. Following the war, he returned to the United States for his university education, studying English, journalism and drama at Midland Lutheran College, Nebraska and the University of Wisconsin in Madison. During his studies he also traveled extensively throughout the United States, taking odd jobs and gathering impressions.

In 1953, Bye took his first job as a reporter with the Associated Press and as a freelancer for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). In 1955, he moved to London and worked three years at the BBC Overseas Service as an apprentice to Anthony Martin before returning home. Bye enjoyed immense popularity with generations of Norwegians, and his songs and programs on radio and television were magnets to audiences of all ages. He was noted for his gift of being equally comfortable with the King of Norway and a random character met on the street. His roaming reports from around the world ranged from searching America for an old Apache chief to bringing an African chieftain from Ghana who answered a message in a bottle released by NRK to Norway.

Bye was well known for his support of Norwegian sailors. He also spent much time helping the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue and their cause, raising funds for a brand new rescue ship in 1960, &quot;Skomvær II&quot;, which was named after the barque &quot;Skomvær&quot; in Bye&#x27;s song &quot;Skomværvalsen.&quot; The society also named one of their rescue vessels after the artist.

In 1978 the King of Norway made him a Knight, 1st Class in the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. In 2005 he was voted the third greatest Norwegian of the 20th century by the viewers of NRK, behind King Olav V and Einar Gerhardsen.

Bye was married to politician Tove Billington Jørgensen from 1953 until his death from cancer, which took place in Hvalstad, Asker, Norway.

<doc id="1090493" wikidata="Q1191129" url="?curid=1090493" title="Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle">
<text>Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle (14 August 1653 – 6 October 1688) was an English Army officer, politician and colonial administrator who sat in the House of Commons from 1667 to 1670 when he inherited his father&#x27;s dukedom and sat in the House of Lords.

Monck briefly served as Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica and is credited with arranging the first boxing match in England.
==Life==
===Early life===
Monck was the son and heir of George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608–1670) by his wife Anne Clarges (d.1700), a daughter of John Clarges, &quot;Farrier in the Savoy&quot;, of Drury Lane, Westminster. Anne&#x27;s brother was Sir Thomas Clarges (c. 1618–1695), MP, who greatly assisted his brother-in-law, the then – before his elevation to the dukedom – General George Monck, in bringing about the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. She was the presumed widow of Thomas Radford, milliner, of New Exchange, Strand, Westminster, although it was said that her husband was still alive when her son was born. This left a question concerning Monck&#x27;s legitimacy.

Monck was educated privately, and entered Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1662. From 1660 until his father&#x27;s death ten years later in 1670, he was known by the courtesy title of Earl of Torrington, one of his father&#x27;s subsidiary titles.

===Career===
At the age of 13, Monck entered politics, having been elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Devon in January 1667. In 1670 he was elevated to the peerage following the death of his father, inheriting his father&#x27;s peerage titles, and thus entered the House of Lords when he reached 21. He became a Gentleman of the Bedchamber and inherited his father&#x27;s great feudal title, Lord of Bowland. He was created a Knight of the Garter, a Privy Councillor and in 1675 Lord Lieutenant of Devon, in which latter role he served for ten years. He became a titular colonel of several horse regiments of the English Army.

In 1673 he raised a regiment as part of the Blackheath Army under Marshal Schomberg. It was intended for service in the Dutch Republic, but was disbanded following the Treaty of Westminster before seeing any action.

On 6 January 1681, Monck arranged a boxing match between his butler and his butcher. This was the first recorded boxing match in England. The butcher won the match.

From 1682 until his death, Monck was Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. In 1685 he resigned the Lord Lieutenancy of Devon to fight against the Monmouth Rebellion, but was largely unsuccessful as a military leader. In 1686, Monck was a major investor in a treasure-seeking expedition headed by William Phips, who had located the wreck of the Spanish treasure ship &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Concepción&quot; in February 1687. Phips returned to London with more than £200,000 worth of treasure, of which Monck received a 25 percent share. 

After serving in a few more minor positions, in 1687, Monck was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica.

===Death and succession===
Monck died in Jamaica on 6 October 1688, aged 35. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 4 July 1689. As the Duke left no children, all his titles became extinct on his death.

==Legacy==
Monck is credited with the first boxing match in England. English buccaneer Ambrose Cowley named the Duke of Albemarle&#x27;s Island after him, the island in the Galapagos now known as Isabela.

==Residences==
===Potheridge, Devon===

His Devonshire seat was Potheridge, three miles south-east of Great Torrington, a grand mansion rebuilt by his father &quot;circa&quot; 1660 on the site of the former manor house occupied by his family since, at the latest, 1287. It was mostly demolished after the death of the 2nd duchess in 1734; the surviving section forms the present Great Potheridge farmhouse – inside which, however, some remnants of the former mansion remain, including two massive 17th-century classical-style doorcases, a colossal overmantel with carved putti and trophies, and a grand staircase.

===Clarendon House, London===

In 1675 Monck purchased for £26,000 the very grand London townhouse Clarendon House from the heirs of its builder, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon (1609–1674). In 1683 he resold it to a consortium of investors led by Sir Thomas Bond, who demolished it and built on its site Albemarle Street, Bond Street and Dover Street.

==Family==
At the royal Palace of Whitehall in London on 30 December 1669, shortly before his father&#x27;s death, Monck married Lady Elizabeth Cavendish (d.1734), eldest daughter and co-heiress of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. She gave birth to a son who died soon after his birth, and Monck left no further surviving children. In 1692 his widow remarried to Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (1638 – c. 1709). She was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 September 1734.

<text>IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration, Explorer 78 or MIDEX-1) was a NASA Medium Explorer mission that studied the global response of the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind. It was believed lost but as of August 2018 might be recoverable. It was launched 25 March 2000, at 20:34:43.929 UTC, by a Delta II launch vehicle from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a two-year mission. Almost six years later, it unexpectedly ceased operations in December 2005 during its extended mission and was declared lost. The spacecraft was part of NASA&#x27;s Sun-Earth Connections Program, and its data has been used in over 400 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals. It had special cameras that provided various breakthroughs in understanding the dynamics of plasma around the Earth. The principal investigator was Jim Burch of the Southwest Research Institute.

In January 2018, an amateur satellite tracker found it to be transmitting some signals back to Earth. NASA made attempts to communicate with the spacecraft and determine its payload status, but has had to track down and adapt old hardware and software to the current systems. On 25 February 2018, contact with IMAGE was again lost only to be reestablished on 4 March 2018. The signal disappeared once again on 5 August 2018. If recovery efforts succeed, NASA may decide to fund a restarted mission.

== Overview ==

IMAGE was the first spacecraft dedicated to imaging the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. IMAGE was a spacecraft developed by the Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX) program, and it was the first spacecraft dedicated to observing the magnetosphere of the Earth, producing comprehensive global images of plasma in the inner magnetosphere. The IMAGE craft was placed in a × orbit around the Earth, with an inclination of 90.01° (passing over the poles) and a 14.2 hour period.

By acquiring images every 2 minutes in wavelengths invisible to the human eye, it allowed detailed study of the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere and the magnetosphere&#x27;s response during a magnetic storm. From its distant orbit, the spacecraft produced a wealth of images of the previously invisible region of space in the inner magnetosphere, exceeded all its scientific goals. A senior review in 2005, just previous to its loss, described the mission as &quot;extremely productive&quot;, having confirmed several theoretical predictions (e.g. plasmasphere plumes, pre-midnight ring-current injection, and continuous antiparallel reconnection), discovered numerous new and unanticipated phenomena (e.g. plasmasphere shoulders, subauroral proton arcs, and a secondary interstellar neutral atom stream), and answered a set of outstanding questions regarding the source region of kilometric continuum radiation, the role of solar wind pressure pulses in ionospheric outflow, and the relationship between proton and electron auroras during substorms. When the spacecraft went silent in December 2005, it had already been approved a mission extension until 2010.

Costs for IMAGE are estimated at US$132 million, including the spacecraft, instruments, launch vehicle, and ground operations.

== Payload ==
Its science payload consists of three suites of instruments:
* Energetic neutral atom imagers (LENA, MENA, HENA) — These instruments use hydrogen, helium, and oxygen atoms in the exosphere to form images and determine the properties of their low-, medium- and high-energy parent ions. HENA, the High Energy Neutral Atom imager is a modified version of the MIMI/INCA (Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument/Ion and Neutral Camera) sensor flown on the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission.
* Ultraviolet imagers (FUV and EUV) — The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imager detects light from helium atoms in Earth&#x27;s plasmasphere. The Far ultraviolet (FUV) imager employs three detectors to image the auroras in different wavelengths and measure the distribution of different ions.
* Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) — This instrument uses pulses of radio waves to image the entire volume of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. With its -long antenna, it sends out a burst of radio waves, which reflect off of clouds of charged particles between the plasmasphere&#x27;s outer boundary all the way out to the boundary where the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is impacted by the solar wind. RPI also measures naturally occurring plasma waves at the spacecraft&#x27;s location.

The Central Instrument Data Processor (CIDP) as well as the Command &amp; Data Handling Subsystem (main on-board computer) were built around the mission-proven IBM RAD6000 avionics processors.

== Experiments ==
=== Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUV) ===

The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUV) of the IMAGE mission observes the distribution of He+ in Earth&#x27;s plasmasphere by detecting its resonantly-scattered emission at 30.4-nm. It records the structure and dynamics of the cold plasma in Earth&#x27;s plasmasphere on a global scale. The 30.4-nm feature is relatively easy to measure because it is the brightest ion emission from the plasmasphere, it is spectrally isolated, and the background at that wavelength is negligible. Measurements are easy to interpret because the plasmaspheric He+ emission is optically thin, so its brightness is directly proportional to the He+ column abundance. Effective imaging of the plasmaspheric He+ requires global &quot;snapshops&quot; in which the high apogee and the wide field of view of EUV provide in a single exposure a map of the entire plasmasphere. EUV consists of three identical sensor heads, each having a field of view of 30° in diameter. These sensors are tilted relative to one another to cover a fan-shaped field of 84° by 30°, which is swept across the plasmasphere by the spin of the satellite. EUV&#x27;s spatial resolution is 0.6° of 0.1 RE in the equatorial plane seen from apogee. The sensitivity is 1.9 count/second-rayleigh, sufficient to map the position of the plasmapause with a time resolution of 10 minutes.

=== Far Ultraviolet Imager (FUV) ===
The IMAGE satellite instrument complement includes three Far Ultraviolet (FUV) instruments. In the wavelength region 120-190 nm, a downward-viewing auroral imager is only minimally contaminated by sunlight, scattered from clouds and ground, and radiance of the aurora observed in a nadir viewing geometry can be observed in the presence of the high-latitude dayglow. The Wideband Imaging Camera (WIC) provides broadband ultraviolet images of the aurora for maximum spatial and temporal resolution by imaging the LBH N2 bands of the aurora. The Spectrographic Imager (SI), a monochromatic imager, images different types of aurora, filtered by wavelength. By measuring the Doppler-shifted Lyman-a, the proton-induced component of the aurora can be imaged separately. Finally, the GEO instrument observes the distribution of the geocoronal emission, which is a measure of the neutral background density source for charge exchange in the magnetosphere. The FUV instrument complement looks radially outward from the rotating IMAGE satellite and, therefore, it spends only a short time observing the aurora and the Earth during each spin (120-seconds period). Detailed descriptions of the WIC, SI, GEO, and their individual performance validations can be found in the January 2000 issue of the Space Science Reviews. One primary requirement of the FUV instrument is to maximize photon collection efficiency and use efficiently the short time available for exposures. The FUV auroral imagers WIC and SI both have wide fields of view and take data continuously as the auroral region proceeds through the field of view. To minimize data volume, multiple images are taken and electronically co-added by suitably shifting each image to compensate for the spacecraft rotation. In order to minimize resolution loss, the images have to be distortion -corrected in real time for both WIC and SI prior to co-adding. The distortion correction is using high speed look up tables that are pre-generated by least square fitting to polynomial functions by the on-orbit processor. The instruments were calibrated individually while on stationery platforms, mostly in vacuum chambers as described in the companion papers. Extensive ground-based testing was performed with visible and near UV simulators mounted on a rotating platform to estimate their on-orbit performance.

=== High-Energy Neutral Atom Imager (HENA) ===
The High-Energy Neutral Atom (HENA) imager on IMAGE is one of three instruments designed to make observations of the Earth&#x27;s magnetospheric environment using neutral atom imaging. The HENA instrument determines the velocity, trajectory, energy, and mass of ENAs in the 10-500 keV energy range and from these data generates images of ENA source regions in the inner magnetosphere. The two main HENA components are the sensor and the main electronics unit (MEU). The HENA sensor consists of alternately charged deflection plates mounted in a fan configuration in front of the entrance slit, three Microchannel plate detectors (MCP), a solid-state detector (SSD), two carbon-silicon-polyimide foils (one at the entrance slit, the other placed just in front of the back MCP), and a series of wires and electrodes to steer secondary electrons ejected from the foils (or the SSD) to the MCPs. Power for the MCPs and deflection plates and for secondary electron steering is provided by high-voltage power supplies that reside with the sensor.
The MEU contains HENA&#x27;s data processing unit (DPU), the analog electronics (which amplifies and processes signals from the sensor and performs housekeeping monitoring), analog-to-digital converters, and a low-voltage power supply.

HENA determines the velocity of the ENAs that it detects by measuring their time of flight (ToF) and trajectory through the sensor (from the entrance slit either to the back foil and two-dimensional imaging MCP detector or to the SSD. When an incoming ENA passes through the entrance foil, it produces secondary electrons, which are accelerated and steered to the front imaging MCP. This MCP, the &quot;start&quot; MCP, provides a start signal for the TOF analysis and registers the position at which the ENA penetrated the entrance slit. The ENA then continues through the sensor to the backplane and strikes either the foil in front of the 2-D imaging MCP or the SSD. In the first case, secondary electrons ejected from the back foil trigger a stop pulse in the 2-D imaging MCP, which also registers the position of the incident ENA. If the ENA strikes the SSD instead, the secondary electrons ejected by the impact are steered to the &quot;coincidence&quot; MCP, which provides the TOF stop signal; the position of impact is registered by the SSD.
The start and stop signals are processed by the analog ToF electronics in the MEU and digitized for input into the DPU. The start and stop pulses give the ENA&#x27;s time of flight, while the position measurements reveal its trajectory and thus its path length within the sensor. With these two pieces of information, time of flight and path length, HENA can calculate the ENA&#x27;s velocity. The energy of the incident ENAs is measured with the SSD. When an ENA strikes the SSD, it generates a current pulse. The amplitude of this pulse (the pulse height) is directly proportional to the amount of energy that the ENA deposits in the SSD crystal. Thus, by analyzing the pulse height, HENA can determine the energy of an ENA incident on the SSD. And as mass is equal to the twice the energy divided by the velocity squared, once the energy and velocity of the ENA have been determined, its mass can be calculated. Calculating mass from the velocity and the SSD energy measurement is the primary technique used by HENA to determine composition of the ENAs. A second technique uses the pulse height of the MCP signal to distinguish between oxygen and hydrogen, the two most common neutral atoms expected in the magnetosphere.

=== Low-Energy Neutral Atom Imager (LENA) ===
The Low-Energy Neutral Atom (LENA) imager on IMAGE is one of three instruments designed to make observations of the Earth&#x27;s magnetospheric environment using neutral atom imaging. The objectives of LENA are to: (1) measure neutrals without interference from electrons, ions or UV; (2) distinguish neutral protons from oxygen; (3) determine ion outflow on five minute time scales over broad range of local times; and, (4) measure energies as low as 10 eV with high counting statistics. The LENA instrument consists of a collimator, conversion unit, extraction lens, dispersive energy analyzer and time-of-flight mass analyzer with position-sensitive particle detection. Neutral particles enter the instrument through a collimator which filters charged particles. LENA converts neutrals to negative ions through a near specular glancing reflection from a tungsten surface. Negative ions from the surface are then collected by an extraction lens which focuses all negative ions with the same energy to a fixed location. In the extraction lens, the ions are accelerated by 20 kV prior to entering the electrostatic analyzer. Finally, the ions pass into a time-of-flight/position sensing section where ion mass, energy, and angle are determined.

=== Medium-Energy Neutral Atom Imager (MENA) ===
The Medium-Energy Neutral Atom (MENA) imager on IMAGE is one of three instruments designed to make observations of the Earth&#x27;s magnetospheric environment using neutral atom imaging. MENA is a slit-type imager designed to detect energetic neutral hydrogen and oxygen atoms with energies ranging from 1 to 30 keV. The instrument determines the time of flight and incidence angle of the incoming ENAs. From these raw data it calculates their trajectory and velocity and generates images of the magnetospheric regions from which they are emitted. The imager consists of three identical sensor heads mounted on a DPU. The three sensor heads are mounted side by side on top of the DPU. The middle sensor looks straight ahead, with a 107° field of view in the plane of the spin axis. The look directions of the two side sensors are offset from that of the middle sensor by 20°. This 20° offset compensates for a 20° blind spot in the center of each detector. The resulting field of view in the plane of the spin axis is 147°. The MENA DPU consists of a single 16-bit Harris RTX2010 microcontroller operating at 4.91 MHz, look-up tables used to process the raw data, a low-voltage power supply, a high-voltage controller, and, for each of the three sensors, the front end time of flight and pulse height electronics and high-voltage power supplies. The DPU communicates with the sensor heads and the Central Instrument Data Processor (CIDP). It monitors instrument health and safety and receives and processes the raw sensor data, producing one image every two minutes (i. e. each spacecraft spin period). It transmits this image, together with a selection of the raw sensor data, event rate data, and housekeeping data, to the CIDP for downlink to Earth.

=== Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) ===
The Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) used pulses of radio waves to &quot;sound&quot; nearly the entire volume of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. With its tip-to-tip antenna, it is one of the biggest sensors ever flown in space. Like a policeman&#x27;s radar detector, the RPI&#x27;s 10-watt transmitter sent out a burst of radio waves, which reflected off of clouds of charged particles between the plasmasphere&#x27;s outer boundary all the way out to the boundary where the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is impacted by the solar wind. The RPI &quot;radar&quot; scans across a spectrum from 3 kilohertz (cycles per second) up to 3 megahertz, spanning the entire AM radio band and beyond. Every five minutes, an image was built from the returned radio signals that will contain information about the direction, speed and density of distant plasma clouds. The instrument was developed by a team led by Dr. Bodo Reinisch, University of Massachusetts at Lowell. The Central Instrument Data Processor (CIDP) provided acquisition, compression, storage and telemetry formatting of science data from all imagers, routes commands to the imagers and interfaces with the spacecraft systems. The CIDP was developed by SwRI.

== Lost contact ==
On 18 December 2005, the satellite failed to make an expected contact at 16:20 UTC. An earlier contact had ended successfully at 07:39 the same day with no sign of trouble. Over the following days and weeks, commands were sent &quot;blind&quot; to reset the transmitter, change antennas, and otherwise attempt to re-establish contact with the spacecraft, but no signal (not even an unmodulated carrier wave) was received. Recovery efforts included using different NASA Deep Space Network (NASA DSN) antennas, using non-NASA ground stations in case there was some systematic NASA DSN error, transmitting no commands for several days to trigger a 72-hour watchdog timer, increasing transmit power in case the antenna was badly misaligned, and optical and radar observations of the satellite to check for debris, change in spin rate or change in orbit indicative of a collision or other damage.

The spacecraft was also commanded to slightly increase its spin rate and asymmetrically turn on its heaters. If observed, these would indicate that it could receive commands but not transmit. Neither change was seen and analysis later indicated that the temperature change would have been undetectable. An attempt to observe the craft&#x27;s temperature to determine if it was completely dead or consuming the power expected in safe mode was inconclusive.

A careful failure analysis revealed that, among plausible causes for an abrupt bidirectional loss of communication, the Solid State Power Converter (SSPC) for the transponder had, among its features, an &quot;instant trip&quot; shutdown in response to a high-current () short circuit. Critically, such a shutdown was &quot;not&quot; reported in the power supply&#x27;s telemetry output and this lack was not documented. Because it was undocumented the spacecraft&#x27;s hardware and software had no provision for attempting to reset the SSPC if it reported good status. This would result in the observed symptoms: no radio communication with an apparently undamaged spacecraft.

Although such a short circuit would be almost impossible without fatal damage to the spacecraft, the shutdown could be falsely triggered by a radiation-induced single event upset. It could be simply fixed by power-cycling the supply, but the spacecraft design left no way to send such a command, nor was one built in.

The same problem with the same model of power supply had affected the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellites (launched after IMAGE), but they were able to recover.

In January 2006, NASA declared the mission over, declaring that &quot;Preliminary analysis indicated the craft&#x27;s power supply subsystems failed, rendering it lifeless&quot;. Despite this, they continued to try and establish contact. In early 2006, NASA convened a board of experts to figure out what went wrong. After several months they created a report in which they theorized that IMAGE had tripped a power breaker and might fix itself.

It was hoped that an eclipse when the spacecraft passed through the Earth&#x27;s shadow in October 2007 would result in a sufficiently deep supply voltage sag that it would trigger a total bus reset, which would cause a power cycle of the suspect supply. However, attempts to contact the craft after this eclipse were not successful.

== Recovery efforts ==
On 20 January 2018 IMAGE was found by Canadian radio amateur and satellite tracker Scott Tilley to be broadcasting, and he reported it to NASA. He had been scanning the S-band (microwaves) in the hopes of finding the Zuma satellite.

On 24 January 2018, Richard Burley of NASA reported that they were trying to establish communication with the satellite using the NASA DSN. Two days later, Burley reported that engineers at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) successfully acquired the signal, and confirmed on 30 January 2018 that IMAGE is the source. It is not known when the satellite started broadcasting, but re-examination of old data recorded by Tilley and fellow satellite tracker Cees Bassa showed transmissions from the same satellite in October 2016 and May 2017. Bassa hypothesized that while the 2007 eclipse did not manage to reset the satellite, another one did the trick, probably sometime between 2014 and 2016.

On 8 February 2018, NASA published a detailed account of the IMAGE satellite&#x27;s recovery. The satellite was transmitting data beyond simple telemetry, indicating that some of its six onboard instruments were still active. NASA engineers are attempting to determine the satellite&#x27;s status, but since the software and hardware type used in the IMAGE Mission Operations Center have been discarded and no longer exist, they are in the process of adapting old software and databases to their modern systems and track down replacement hardware.

On 25 February 2018, NASA again lost contact with the satellite, but not in the same manner it did in 2005. Richard Burley, former IMAGE mission director, stated that he believes there is an issue with IMAGE&#x27;s spin axis in relation to its medium-gain antenna placement. If NASA can regain control of the spacecraft, and the status of data and ground systems can be assessed, it will decide if it can fund a mission restart.

On 4 March 2018, the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University reported detecting the signal from the satellite, but it was too faint to lock onto.

On 9 May 2018, Scott Tilley again detected a strong signal from IMAGE. Hours later NASA and APL engineers had locked onto the signal and were receiving telemetry. Commands were transmitted to IMAGE, but for unknown reasons the spacecraft only acknowledged receipt of a fraction of those commands.

On 28 August 2018, NASA announced that the IMAGE team had stopped receiving any signals from the satellite, as previously happened in winter, and would continue to try sending commands.

On 20 January 2019, a full year passed since the spacecraft&#x27;s rediscovery date and it has remained out of contact since 5 August 2018. Efforts continue, especially following eclipses which might reset the electronics.

<doc id="1090511" wikidata="Q862265" url="?curid=1090511" title="Mount Revelstoke National Park">
<text>Mount Revelstoke National Park is a national park located adjacent to the city of Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada. The park is relatively small for a national park, covering . It is located in the Selkirk Mountains and was founded in 1914. Approximately 600,000 visitors enter Mount Revelstoke and nearby Glacier National Park each year.

== History ==
Mount Revelstoke is part of a string of mountain national parks along the Canadian Pacific Railway corridor including Banff, Yoho, and Glacier. Established in 1914, its creation came later than the other mountain national parks which date to the 1880s. The initiative to establish a park was led by local residents of Revelstoke; the mountaineering and skiing clubs worked with municipal officials and the local Progress Club to build the first trail to the summit of Mount Revelstoke in 1910. Park boundaries were extended southward toward the Revelstoke townsite in 1920. A lodge and tea house, known as Heather Lake Lodge, were constructed in the 1930s, and demolished in 1966.

=== Meadows in the Sky Parkway ===
The 26-kilometre summit road, now known as the Meadows in the Sky Parkway, was started in 1911, and was completed in 1927. During the First World War, Parks Commissioner J.B. Harkin authorized the use of interned &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, mostly men from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, on construction projects in the national parks. An internment camp was constructed on the slopes of Mount Revelstoke in 1915. Over 200 interned men worked on the road to the summit, but began to refuse work once cold weather hampered them in the fall. The camp was abandoned and the men moved to other camps in the region.

=== Skiing ===
By the early 20th century, Revelstoke had become a popular skiing area, one of the first ski destinations in North America. Mount Revelstoke became the home of a ski-jumping facility in 1915; this was expanded to Olympic specifications in 1933. Other downhill runs were added, and Mount Revelstoke hosted many international competitions in the first half of the century. The jump was the longest natural jump in Canada, and international records were set there. Nels Nelsen was an early supporter of the skiing facilities and set several of the jumping records. The last event was held in 1971, and the ski area was converted to a trail system for hiking and downhill mountain biking.

==Climate==
The park contains a portion of one of the world&#x27;s few inland temperate rainforests. Steep, rugged mountains can be found in a warm, moist climate. A variety of plant and animal life is typical with stands of old-growth Western Redcedar and Western Hemlock, a forest type which is rapidly declining outside of protected areas. The park&#x27;s inland rainforest also has an isolated population of banana slugs which marks the easternmost boundary of their distribution in British Columbia.

==Fauna==
This national park protects a small herd of the threatened caribou as well as providing habitats for cougars, grizzly bears, lynxes, black bears, red foxes, moose, martens, coyotes, a variety of bats, timber wolves, several species of shrews, voles, mice, wolverines, and mountain goats.

==Flora==
A variety of wildflowers grow in the park, some of which include Arctic lupine, glacier lily, pink mountain heather, willowherb, and spotted saxifrage. Wetland plant species that are found in the park include skunk cabbage, duckweed, and horsetail. Lichen, moss, and fungi also grow in the park&#x27;s temperate rainforest habitat.

==Tourism==
The Meadows-in-the-Sky Parkway is a paved mountain road open during the snow free months. The parkway begins in the rainforests of the park&#x27;s southwest corner, winds upward through the sub-alpine forests and ends in the rolling sub-alpine wildflower meadows. The Monashee Mountains rise to the west, with the Selkirk range to the east.

Giant Cedars Boardwalk is a 500 m. (0.3 mi.) interpretive trail that twists through a stand of old-growth western red cedar and hemlock trees, some more than 800 years old. Exhibits along the way explore the secrets of this inland rainforest.

Skunk Cabbage Boardwalk is a 1.2 km. (0.75 mi.) interpretive trail that leads through valley bottom rainforest and fragile wetlands inhabited by muskrats, beavers, bears and the strange skunk cabbage plant. Exhibits also help to identify the many birds that migrate from South and Central America to the Skunk Cabbage area each year.

<doc id="1090517" wikidata="Q460186" url="?curid=1090517" title="Alice Neel">
<text>Alice Neel (January 28, 1900 – October 13, 1984) was an American visual artist. Recognized for her paintings of friends, family, lovers, poets, artists, and strangers, Neel is considered one of the greatest American portraitists of the 20th century. Her career spanned from the 1920s to 1980s.

Her paintings have an expressionistic use of line and color, psychological acumen, and emotional intensity. She pursued a career as a figurative painter during a period when abstraction was favored, and she did not begin to gain critical praise for her work until the 1960s. Her work contradicts and challenges the traditional and objectified nude depictions of women by her male predecessors. This is done by depicting women through a female gaze, illustrating them as being consciously aware of the objectification by men and the demoralizing effects of the male gaze.

==Life and work==
===Early life===

Alice Neel was born on January 28, 1900, in Merion Square, Pennsylvania. Her father was George Washington Neel, an accountant for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and her mother was Alice Concross Hartley Neel. In mid-1900 her family moved to the rural town of Colwyn, Pennsylvania. Young Alice was the fourth of five children with three brothers and a sister. Her siblings were named Hartley, Albert, Lillian, and George Washington Jr. Her oldest brother, Hartley, died of diphtheria shortly after she was born. He was eight years old. She was raised in a straight-laced, lower-middle-class family during a time when there were limited expectations and opportunities for women. Her mother had said to her: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you expect to do in the world, you&#x27;re only a girl.&quot; From a young age Alice wanted to be an artist, even with little exposure to art.

In 1918, after graduating from high school, she took the civil service exam and got a high-paying clerical position in order to help support her parents. After three years of work, taking art classes by night in Philadelphia, Neel enrolled in the fine art program at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (now Moore College of Art &amp; Design) in 1921. In her student works she rejected impressionism, the popular style at the time, and instead embraced the Ashcan School of Realism. It is believed this influence came from one of the most prominent figures of the Ashcan School, Robert Henri, who also taught at Philadelphia School of Design for Women. At Philadelphia School of Design for Women, she won honorable mention in her painting class for the Francisca Naiade Balano Prize two years in a row. In 1925 Neel received the Kern Doge Prize for Best Painting in her life class. She graduated from Philadelphia School of Design for Women in 1925.

===Cuba===
In 1924, Neel met Carlos Enríquez, an upper-class Cuban painter, at the Chester Springs summer school run by PAFA. The couple married on June 1, 1925, in Colwyn, Pennsylvania. Neel soon moved to Havana to live with Enríquez&#x27;s family. In Havana, Neel was embraced by the burgeoning Cuban avant-garde, a set of young writers, artists and musicians. In this environment Neel developed the foundations of her lifelong political consciousness and commitment to equality. Neel later said she had her first solo exhibition in Havana, but there are no dates or locations to confirm this. In March 1927, Neel exhibited with her husband in the 12th Salon des Bellas Artes. This exhibition also included Eduardo Abela, Víctor Manuel García Valdés, Marcelo Pogolotti, and Amelia Peláez who were all part of the Cuban Vanguardia Movement. During this time, she had seven servants and lived in a mansion.

===Personal difficulties, themes for art===
Neel&#x27;s daughter, Santillana, was born on December 26, 1926, in Havana. In 1927, though, the couple returned to the United States to live in New York. Just a month before Santillana&#x27;s first birthday, she died of diphtheria. The trauma caused by Santillana&#x27;s death infused the content of Neel&#x27;s paintings, setting a precedent for the themes of motherhood, loss, and anxiety that permeated her work for the duration of her career. Shortly following Santillana&#x27;s death, Neel became pregnant with her second child. On November 24, 1928, Isabella Lillian (called Isabetta) was born in New York City. Isabetta&#x27;s birth was the inspiration for Neel&#x27;s &quot;Well Baby Clinic&quot;, a bleak portrait of mothers and babies in a maternity clinic more reminiscent of an insane asylum than a nursery.

In the spring of 1930, Carlos had given the impression that he was going overseas to look for a place to live in Paris. Instead, he returned to Cuba, taking Isabetta with him. During the time of Enriquez&#x27;s absence, Neel sublet her New York apartment and traveled to work in the studio of her friends and fellow painters Ethel V. Ashton and Rhonda Myers.

Mourning the loss of her husband and daughter, Neel had a nervous breakdown, was hospitalized, and attempted suicide. She was placed in the suicide ward of the Philadelphia General Hospital.

Deemed stable almost a year later, Neel was released from the sanatorium in 1931 and returned to her parents&#x27; home. Following an extended visit with her close friend and frequent subject, Nadya Olyanova, Neel returned to New York.

===Depression era===
There Neel painted the local characters, including Joe Gould, whom she depicted in 1933 with multiple penises, which represented his inflated ego and &quot;self-deception&quot; about who he was and his unfulfilled ambitions. The painting, a rare survivor of her early works, has been shown at Tate Modern.

During the Depression, Neel was one of the first artists to work for the Works Progress Administration. At the end of 1933, Neel was offered $30 a week to participate in the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) during an interview at the Whitney Museum. She had been living in poverty. While Neel participated in the PWAP and the Works Progress Administration (WPA)/Federal Art Project, her work gained some recognition in the art world. While enrolled in these government programs she painted in a realist style and her subjects were mostly Depression-era street scenes and Communist thinkers and leaders. Some of these sitters included Mother Bloor, the poet Kenneth Fearing, and Pat Whalen. She had an affair with a man named Kenneth Doolittle who was a heroin addict and a sailor. In 1934, he set afire 350 of her watercolors, paintings and drawings. At this time, her husband Carlos proposed to reunite, although in the end the couple neither reunited nor officially filed for divorce.

She consorted with artists, intellectuals, and political leaders of the Communist Party, all of whom became subjects for her paintings. Her work glorified subversion and sexuality, depicting whimsical scenes of lovers and nudes, like a watercolor she made in 1935, &quot;Alice Neel and John Rothschild in the Bathroom&quot;, which showed the naked pair peeing. In the 1930s, Neel gained a reputation as an artist, and established a good standing within her circle of downtown intellectuals and Communist Party leaders. While Neel was never an official Communist Party member, her affiliation and sympathy with the ideals of Communism remained constant. In the 1930s, Neel moved to the Spanish Harlem and began painting her neighbors, specifically women and children.

===Female nude portraits===
The summer of 1930 was a period in her life that she described &quot;as one of her most productive&quot; because that was when she painted her earliest female nudes. Initially Neel preferred painting men to women. She believed women in art represented a dreary way of life consisting of serving men. It was during the time when she felt most vulnerable because of the loss of her children and separation from her husband. That autumn she had a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized. Neel&#x27;s subject matter changed; she went from painting portraits of ordinary people, family, friends, strangers, and well-known art critics to female nudes. The female nude in Western art had always represented a &quot;Woman&quot; as vulnerable, anonymous, passive, and ageless and the quintessential object of the male gaze. However, Neel&#x27;s female nudes contradicted and &quot;satirized the notion and the standards of the female body.&quot; By this sharp contrast to this prevailing idealistic idea of how the female body should be portrayed in art, art historians believe that she was able to free her female sitters from this prevailing ideology that in turn gave them an identity and power. Through her use of &quot;expressive line, vibrant palette, and psychological intensity&quot;, Neel did not depict the human body in a realistic manner; it was the way she was able to capture and dignify her sitters&#x27; psychological and internal standpoint that made the portraits realistic. For this reason, many art critics today describe Neel&#x27;s female nudes as truthful and honest portraits, although at the time the works were controversial in the art world because they questioned women&#x27;s traditional role. Neel often painted women in social interaction or in public spaces, starkly challenging the &quot;Spheres of Femininity&quot; that most 19th-century women artists existed and worked within. In other words, it is believed that Neel challenged the norms of women&#x27;s role in the household and in everyday life from her paintings. Neel fundamentally changed the way the art establishment viewed the potentialities of the female nude by depicting an unprecedented range of the female experience. 

One of Neel&#x27;s best known early female nude portraits is of Ethel V. Ashton (1930). Neel depicted Ethel, her friend from the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (now part of Moore College of Art and Design), as many art historians described as &quot;nearly crippled with self conscious by her own exposure&quot;. Ethel&#x27;s body was exposed in a crouched seated position, where she was able to look the viewer directly in the eye. Ethel&#x27;s eyes were commonly described as &quot;soulful&quot; and expressing a sense a fear. Neel painted her friend through a distorted scale that added to the idea of &quot;vulnerability and fearfulness&quot;. Neel said of the image: &quot;She&#x27;s almost apologizing for living. And look at all the furniture she has to carry all the time.&quot; By furniture the artist &quot;referred to her heavy thighs, bulging stomach, and pendulous breasts.&quot; The formal elements of the painting, light and shadow, the brushstrokes, and the color are suggested to add pathos and humor to the work but they are done in a precise manner to convey a certain tone, which is vulnerability. The painting was exhibited 43 years later at the Alumni Exhibition, where it was severely criticized by many art critics and the general public. The reaction that the painting received was a firm dislike as it was thought it was going against the norms of how female nudes were supposed to be depicted. Ethel, the female nude, saw it on display and &quot;stormed out of rage&quot;. The particular painting of the female nude was neither sexual nor flattering to the female form. However, Neel&#x27;s aim was not to paint the female body in an idealistic way, she wanted to paint in a truthful and honest manner. For this reason she thought of herself as a realist painter.

===Post-war years===
Neel&#x27;s second son, Hartley, was born in 1941 to Neel and her lover, the communist intellectual Sam Brody. During the 1940s, Neel made illustrations for the Communist publication &quot;Masses &amp; Mainstream&quot;, and continued to paint portraits from her uptown home. However, in 1943 the Works Progress Administration ceased working with Neel, which made it harder for the artist to support her two sons. During this time, Neel would shoplift and was on welfare to help make ends meet. Between 1940 and 1950, Neel&#x27;s art virtually disappeared from galleries, save for one solo show in 1944. In the 1950s, her friendship with Mike Gold and his admiration for her social realist work garnered her a show at the Communist-inspired New Playwrights Theatre. In 1959, Neel even made a film appearance after the director Robert Frank asked her to appear alongside a young Allen Ginsberg in his beatnik film, &quot;Pull My Daisy&quot;. The following year, her work was first reproduced in &quot;ARTnews&quot; magazine.

===Pregnant female nudes===

By the mid-1960s, many of Neel&#x27;s female friends had become pregnant which inspired her to paint a series of these women nude. The portraits truthfully highlight instead of hiding the physical changes and emotional anxieties that coexist with childbirth. When she was asked why she painted pregnant nudes, Neel replied,

Neel chose to paint the &quot;basic facts of life&quot; and strongly believed that this form of subject matter is worthy enough to be painted in the nudes, which was what distinguished her from other artists of her time. The pregnant nudes suggested by the art historian, Ann Temkin, allowed Neel to &quot;collapse the imaginary dichotomy that polarizes women into the chaste Madonna or the specter of the dangerous whore&quot; as the portraits were of ordinary women that one sees all around, but not in art.

One of her works that depicted a pregnant female nude is &quot;Margaret Evans Pregnant&quot; (1978), now in the collection of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. Margaret was painted while sitting on upright chair that forced her to expose her pregnant stomach even more, which became the central point in the canvas. Right behind the chair a mirror was placed which allowed the viewer to see the back of her head and neck. However, the mirrored reflection did not look anything like Margaret&#x27;s frontal portrait. The motive behind this particular section of the painting remains unknown, but art historian Jeremy Lewison says the image is &quot;an uncanny double of the sitter and the artist, presaging older age&quot;, and suggests that the reflection is of an older and wiser woman and perhaps a combination of Margaret and Neel&#x27;s reflection. Pamela Allara says Neel has been accurately characterized as a &quot;sort of artist–sociologist who revived and redirected the dying genre of ameliorative portraiture by merging objectivity with subjectivity, realism with expressionism. In visually interpreting a person&#x27;s habitus, Neel understood that she could not be an objective observer, that her depictions would of necessity include her own response.&quot;

===Neel&#x27;s self-portrait and last paintings===

Neel painted Kate Millett in 1970, using photographs of Millett to do so, because Millett had refused to pose for Neel. Kate Millett was the author of &quot;Sexual Politics&quot;., an important text of second-wave feminism. Alice Neel&#x27;s career was given new life by the feminist art movement, and Kate Millett was a feminist icon of the time. Neel considered herself &quot;a collector of souls&quot; and she aimed to capture Millett&#x27;s powerful aura. Neel painted this portrait at a time when many independent women, fighting for equal opportunities and being ignored, were looking for a mentor. In this painting, Kate Millett is directly looking at the viewer, and her stare is very commanding. Kate Millett was featured in the September 25, 2017 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in which &quot;Time&quot; referred to her as the &quot;high priestess&quot; of feminism and to &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; as the feminist bible.

Neel painted herself in her eightieth year of life, seated on a chair in her studio. She presented herself fully nude. She wore her glasses and held her paintbrush on right hand and an old cloth on the other hand. The white color of her hair and the several creases and folds of her bare skin indicated her old age. As she painted herself seated on the chair her body faced away from the viewer while head was turned towards the viewer. The portrait was completed in 1980 but she had started to paint it five years earlier, before abandoning it for a period of time. However, she was encouraged by her son Richard to complete it and came back to in her early 80s as she was also invited to take part in an exhibition of self-portraits at the Harold Reed Gallery in New York. When Neel&#x27;s unconventional self-portrait was showcased it attracted considerable attention. Neel painted herself in a truthful manner as she exposed her saggy breasts and belly for everyone to see. Yet again in her last painting, she challenged the social norms of what was acceptable to be depicted in art. Her self-portrait was one of her last works before she died.

On October 13, 1984, Neel died with her family present in her New York City apartment, from advanced colon cancer.

==Recognition==
Toward the end of the 1960s, interest in Neel&#x27;s work intensified. The momentum of the women&#x27;s movement led to increased attention, and Neel became an icon for feminists. In 1970, she was commissioned to paint the feminist activist Kate Millett for the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Millett refused to sit for Neel; consequently, the magazine cover was based on a photograph.

Her image is included in the iconic 1972 poster Some Living American Women Artists by Mary Beth Edelson.

By the mid-1970s, Neel had gained celebrity and stature as an important American artist. The American Academy and the Institute of Arts and Letters elected Neel in 1976. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter presented her with a National Women&#x27;s Caucus for Art award for outstanding achievement. Neel&#x27;s recognition was at its height at the time of her death in 1984.

Neel&#x27;s life and works are featured in the documentary &quot;Alice Neel&quot;, which premiered at the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival and was directed by her grandson, Andrew Neel. The film was given a New York theatrical release in April of that year.

Her career was used in a 3-episode series of the Freakonomics podcast &quot;The Hidden Side of the Art Market&quot;, illustrating that &quot;the art market is so opaque and illiquid that it barely functions like a market at all&quot;.

Neel&#x27;s work was included in the 2022 exhibition &quot;Women Painting Women&quot; at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.

==Exhibitions==
In 1943, Neel&#x27;s female nude portrait of Ethel Ashton was exhibited at Alumni Exhibition for the very first time, 13 years after the painting was created, and received brutal criticisms from art critics and the general public.

In 1971, Moore College of Art hosted a solo exhibition of alumna Neel&#x27;s work.

In 1974, Neel&#x27;s work was given a retrospective exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and posthumously, in the summer of 2000, also at the Whitney.

In 1980. she was invited to take part in an exhibition of self-portraits at the Harold Reed Gallery in New York, where her self-portrait was showcased for the first time.

In 2001 the Philadelphia Museum of Art organized a retrospective of her art entitled &quot;Alice Neel&quot;.

In 2004, the first exhibition dedicated to Neel&#x27;s works in Europe was held in London, at the Victoria Miro Gallery. Jeremy Lewison, who had worked at the Tate, was the curator of the collection.

In 2010, Jeremy Lewison and Barry Walker presented, for Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, &quot;Alice Neel: Painted Truths&quot;, on view from March 21 to June 15, 2010, which later went to the Whitechapel Gallery, London and Moderna Museet Malmö, Sweden.

In 2013, the first major presentation of the artist&#x27;s watercolors and drawings, as &quot;Alice Neel: Intimate Relations&quot;, was on view at Nordiska Akvarellmuseet in Skärhamn, Sweden.

In 2015, Xavier Hufkens began representing &quot;The Estate of Alice Neel&quot;.

In 2016, the Ateneum, Helsinki presented &quot;Alice Neel: Painter of Modern Life&quot;, which later went to the Kunstmuseum Den Haag, The Hague, the Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles, France, and, in 2018, the Deichtorhallen, Hamburg, Germany, from October 10, 2017, to January 14, 2018.

In 2017, Hilton Als curated the exhibition &quot;Alice Neel, Uptown&quot; at the Victoria Miro Gallery in London (May 18 – July 29, 2017).

In March 2021, a career-spanning retrospective of Neel&#x27;s work opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Titled &quot;Alice Neel: People Come First&quot;, the exhibit featured more than 100 works and was the largest-ever show of Neel&#x27;s work in New York and the first in two decades.

In September 2021, &quot;Alice Neel: People Come First&quot;, a retrospective of her work, opened at the Guggenheim Bilbao on September 17 and ran through February 6, 2022. Subsequently, opened at de Young Museum on March 12, 2022, and ran through July 10, 2022.

In 2023, &quot;Alice Neel: Hot Off The Griddle&quot;, the largest exhibition of her work to date in the UK, opened at The Barbican Centre Art Gallery in London running from 16 February until 21 May 2023.

In 2024, &quot;Alice Neel: At Home&quot;, curated by Hilton Als, was the first major exhibition to focus on queer communities and those who were part of her circle, opened at David Zwirner Gallery.

<text>An independent software vendor (ISV), also known as a software publisher, is an organization specializing in making and selling software, as opposed to computer hardware, designed for mass or niche markets. This is in contrast to in-house software, which is developed by the organization that will use it, or custom software, which is designed or adapted for a single, specific third party. Although ISV-provided software is consumed by end users, it remains the property of the vendor.

Software products developed by ISVs serve a wide variety of purposes. Examples include software for real estate brokers, scheduling for healthcare personnel, barcode scanning, stock maintenance, gambling, retailing, energy exploration, vehicle fleet management, and child care management software.

An ISV makes and sells software products that run on one or more computer hardware or operating system platforms. Companies that make the platforms, such as Microsoft, AWS, Cisco, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Red Hat, Google, Oracle, VMware, Lenovo, Apple, SAP, Salesforce and ServiceNow encourage and lend support to ISVs, often with special &quot;business partner&quot; programs. These programs enable the platform provider and the ISV to leverage joint strengths and convert them into incremental business opportunities.

Independent software vendors have become one of the primary groups in the IT industry, often serving as relays to disseminate new technologies and solutions.

Examples of ISV includes Microsoft, Red Hat, Canonical, Adobe, Oracle.

<text>The Plana Cays are a group of two small uninhabited islands in the southern Bahama Islands, located east of Acklins Island and west of Mayaguana Island. The indigenous Lucayan people called the islands &quot;Amaguaya&quot;, meaning &quot;toward the middle lands&quot;.
The eastern cay was the last natural habitat of the Bahamian Hutia, a species of rabbit-sized rodent. It was thought to be extinct until 1966, when a population was found on the Plana Cays by biologist Garrett Clough. Hutias have since been transplanted from the Plana Cays to other parts of the Bahamas.

The Plana Cays have been suggested as the first landfall of Christopher Columbus in the New World.

<doc id="1090529" wikidata="Q7890809" url="?curid=1090529" title="United States Navy Armed Guard">
<text>The United States Navy Armed Guard was a force of United States Navy gunners and related personnel established during World War II to protect U.S. merchant shipping from enemy attack. A shortage of escort vessels to provide unarmed merchant vessels with adequate protection shifted the burden to onboard crews to help counter the constant danger presented by Axis submarines, surface raiders, fighter aircraft and bombers. The NAG was headquartered in New Orleans, and had three training centers, at Norfolk, Virginia; San Diego, California; and Gulfport, Mississippi. At the end of the war, there were 144,857 men serving in the Navy Armed Guard on 6,200 ships.
== Unit composition ==
The United States Navy Armed Guard (USNAG) were U.S. Navy gun crews consisting of Gunner&#x27;s Mates, Coxswains and Boatswains, Radiomen, Signalmen, an occasional Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate serving at sea on merchant ships; toward the end of the war a few radar men joined the crews. The Armed Guard served on Allied merchant marine ships in every theatre of the war. Initially, a shortage of trained officers found chiefs and even petty officers in command; later a single commissioned officer would be in charge.

== Duty ==
The assignment as an Armed Guardsman was often dreaded because of the constant danger. Merchant ships were slow, unwieldy, and because of their lack of armor, firepower, and the important cargoes they carried, priority targets of submarines and planes. Furthermore, merchant ships were among the last to receive updated equipment. Early on in the war, some ships only had a few machine guns, so the crews painted telephone poles to imitate the barrels of larger guns. The most common armament mounted on merchant ships were the MK II 20mm Oerlikon autocannon and the 3&quot;/50, 4&quot;/50, and 5&quot;/38 deck guns.

When practicable, the Navy Armed Guard aboard a merchant ship would provide cross-training to merchant crew members in the use of the guns in the event of casualties. The Navy Armed Guardsmen would typically sail round trip on the same ship, occasionally they would get a different assignment upon reaching their destination depending on Allied convoy schedules.

== In film ==
The 1943 film &quot;Action in the North Atlantic&quot;, featuring Humphrey Bogart, Raymond Massey, and Alan Hale, illustrates the importance of the Naval Armed Guard and how it interfaced with the Merchant Marine officers and crew.

<doc id="1090533" wikidata="Q2043332" url="?curid=1090533" title="Sport in Ireland">
<text>Sport in Ireland plays an important role in Irish society. The many sports played and followed in Ireland include Gaelic games (including Gaelic football, hurling, camogie and handball), association football, horse racing, show jumping, greyhound racing, basketball, fishing, motorsport, boxing, tennis, hockey, golf, rowing, cricket, and rugby union.

In terms of participation, association football (soccer) is the most popular team pursuit for males at 8.8% with Gaelic football attracting 3.4%. Personal exercise (at 13.4%) and running (8.9%) are the most popular individual male activities. Traditionally, team sports do not figure highly amongst females, with a greater percentage of post-school-age women choosing individual sports and fitness activities. As of 2018, additional funding and focus was afforded to females in sport, with a number of successes in women&#x27;s international sporting competitions. Association football (soccer) is the most played team sport in Ireland. Gaelic football, hurling, golf, aerobics, cycling, swimming and billiards/snooker are the other sporting activities with the highest levels of participation in the Republic of Ireland.

In terms of support and attendance, Gaelic football accounted for 34% of total sports attendances at events in the Republic of Ireland in 2003, followed by hurling at 23%, association football (soccer) at 16% and rugby at 8%. In 2005, Initiative&#x27;s ViewerTrack study measuring sports audiences showed that Gaelic football&#x27;s highest-profile match, the All-Ireland Football Championship Final, was the most watched event of the nation&#x27;s sporting year.

In terms of funding, of the €62 million allocated in the Irish government&#x27;s 2017 Capital Sports Programme, approximately €25 million was allocated to hurling, Gaelic football and other games overseen by the Gaelic Athletic Association, €7.7 million to soccer, €3.3 million to rugby, €2.8 million to tennis, golf €2.4 million, sailing and rowing €1.3 million each, boxing and athletics over €1 million each, swimming €0.5 million, with the remainder allocated among other sports and sporting groups.

As Northern Ireland is a constituent nation of the United Kingdom, it also sends a Northern Ireland Team to the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympic Games, a person from Northern Ireland can choose to represent either Ireland or Great Britain.

==Gaelic games==

In a survey released in January 2021, Gaelic games were collectively identified as &quot;Ireland&#x27;s favourite sport(s)&quot;.

===Gaelic football===
The sport may be referred to as &quot;Gaelic football&quot; or &quot;Gaelic&quot;, if confusion might otherwise arise with association football, but is referred to simply as &#x27;football&#x27; within the sport itself, such as the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Though it has existed for centuries in Ireland as Caid, Gaelic football was formally arranged into an organised playing code by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in the late nineteenth century. In terms of support and attendance, it is the most popular sport in Ireland.

The game is played at underage, minor (under 18), under 21 and adult levels. All players are amateur, although players at a high level may receive income from sources such as sponsorship and grants. Gaelic footballers play for a local club or parish team, with the best chosen for the inter-county sides. County players may be chosen to play in inter-provincial Railway Cup games or for the &#x27;International Rules&#x27; team to face Australia. The main national competitions are the inter-county All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and National Football League, also known as the NFL.

A Gaelic football year starts with pre-season competitions and the National Football League. In early summer, the Championship begins. Each of the four provinces has its own tournament, and teams which are knocked out must do well in the &#x27;qualifiers&#x27; if they are to gain a spot along with the four Provincial Champions in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The All-Ireland Senior Football final is traditionally held on the third Sunday in September. Kerry are football&#x27;s most successful team, with 37 All-Ireland senior titles. There are a number of rivalries within the game – an example is that between Dublin and Meath. Other notable derbies or rivalries include Cork v Kerry, Mayo v Galway, Kerry v Dublin and Tyrone v Donegal.

=== Hurling ===
Hurling is a sport native to Ireland for several thousand years, organized by the Gaelic Athletic Association. In terms of attendance figures, hurling is second only to Gaelic football. Hurling is sometimes described as the &quot;fastest field sport in the world&quot;, as the ball is continually played at high speeds.

The game has similarities to shinty and hockey. However the ball (or &quot;sliotar&quot;) is rarely played along the ground. Hurling is played on a large grass pitch.

Many aspects of the organisation of hurling are similar to football, as both sports are organised by the GAA. Amateurism and the club/county/province structure are similar. Gaelic football has a larger footprint in terms of top-level competition, but in several counties where both sports are played, hurling sometimes holds precedence, and in certain parts of the country, it is the dominant game (Kilkenny, rural Antrim, Ards peninsula in County Down, and Clare, for example). Hurling is well-attended at elite level and the highest-level games fill Croke Park to its capacity of over 82,000. The main competitions are the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, the Leinster and Munster provincial championships and the National Hurling League (NHL).

Hurling and camogie are both included on UNESCO&#x27;s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

=== Camogie ===

Camogie, played exclusively by women, is similar to hurling although a smaller sliotar is used, there is the option to hand-pass into the goal, and the dress code requires players to wear a skort. The first game of camogie was played in County Meath in 1904.

=== Gaelic handball ===
Gaelic handball, or simply &#x27;handball&#x27;, like the related sport of American handball, somewhat resembles squash or racquetball, but with the ball played or struck with the hand or fist instead of a racquet. It has no connection with the Olympic sport of handball which has limited following in Ireland, where it is generally known as Olympic handball.

In Ireland, there are four main types of handball. These are 40x20 (small court), the traditional 60x30 Softball and Hardball (big alley) and One-wall handball. Handball is played with a variety of balls. Gloves and eyeguards are compulsory for some competitions. The sport is managed and promoted by GAA Handball, a subsidiary body of the GAA.

=== Rounders ===
Rounders () is regulated by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Ireland, and is similar to baseball. Game-play centers around innings where teams alternate at turns being batters and fielders. Points (&quot;rounders&quot;) are scored by the batting team by completing a circuit around the field through four bases

==Association football==

Association football is a popular sport in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland but while international matches play before large crowds, and are passionately followed, domestic league games typically attract smaller attendances. English football leagues are also popular in Ireland, with a survey in February 2020 indicating that up to 40,000 Irish fans travel to games in England on a &quot;regular basis&quot;.

The national body in the Republic of Ireland is the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) while the national body in Northern Ireland is the Irish Football Association (IFA).

The domestic leagues are the League of Ireland (in the Republic) and the NIFL Premiership (or Irish League) (Northern Ireland). Some of the major teams in Ireland include Shamrock Rovers, Dundalk FC and Shelbourne FC in the Republic, Glentoran and Linfield in Northern Ireland, and Derry City, a team from the North who play in the League of Ireland. Due to the financial incentives abroad, most of Ireland&#x27;s top players, such as Damien Duff, John O&#x27;Shea, Aiden McGeady and Jonny Evans, play in the leagues of larger European countries, particularly in England and Scotland. This, along with the Irish media&#x27;s huge coverage of the English league, is one of the reasons why Irish people tend to support leading British clubs such as Manchester United, Liverpool and Celtic. Only occasionally does a League of Ireland or Irish League player make either of the national teams, despite the fact that the leagues sometimes produce some of Ireland&#x27;s top players including internationals Kevin Doyle, Shane Long and Gareth McAuley and players like Roy Keane in the past.

On the international stage, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland teams have both competed in three FIFA World Cups, with the Republic also appearing in three European Championships, most recently in 2016.

The Milk Cup is an international youth tournament held annually in Northern Ireland, in which clubs and national teams from elsewhere in the world may compete. Northern Ireland also played host to the 2005 UEFA Under-19 European Championships.

==Rugby union==

Rugby union is played and supported throughout Ireland, and is especially popular in urban areas such as Dublin, Limerick, Belfast in Northern Ireland, and Cork. Rugby union is played at club, province and national levels. The Ireland national team is composed of players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic, and the Irish Rugby Football Union governs the sport throughout the island. The sport is organised at all levels on an all-island basis through a provincial structure of four unions, with each province organising one professional team in elite competition.

Success at international level and the establishment of four professional teams has increased interest in rugby union as a sport in Ireland, particularly as a spectator sport. At the 2018 World Rugby Awards, Ireland had been presented with a &#x27;hat-trick&#x27; of awards, with Johnny Sexton winning the Player of the Year, Joe Schmidt the Coach of the Year, and the national squad the Team of the Year awards. As of July 2022, following two defeats of New Zealand, the Ireland national rugby union team was ranked 1st in the World Rugby Rankings, but has never progressed beyond the quarter finals of the men&#x27;s Rugby World Cup.

School rugby union is also played at primary and secondary level, and traditional rugby playing schools include: St Michael&#x27;s College, Blackrock College, Belvedere College, Castleknock College, Clongowes Wood College, St Mary&#x27;s College, and Terenure College in Dublin, Crescent College, Castletroy College, St Munchin&#x27;s College, Glenstal Abbey and Ardscoil Rís in Limerick, Rockwell College in Tipperary, Presentation Brothers College, Bandon Grammar School and Christian Brothers College in Cork, and Campbell College, Royal Belfast Academical Institution and Methodist College Belfast in the north.

== Boxing ==
Boxing is overseen by the Boxing Union of Ireland and Irish Athletic Boxing Association. Amateur boxers account for sixteen of Ireland&#x27;s 31 Olympic medals, including two Olympic gold medals. Ireland&#x27;s amateur boxers have also won medals at numerous top level competitions worldwide including World Senior Championships, European Senior Championships, World Junior Championships, World Youth Championships, European Junior Championships and European Youth Championships.

The country&#x27;s most successful boxers include Steve Collins, Bernard Dunne, Barry McGuigan, Michael Carruth, Ryan Burnett, Andy Lee, John Duddy, Carl Frampton, Kellie Harrington and Katie Taylor. The latter is among the world&#x27;s most successful female boxers, and Taylor has won five European Championships and four World Championships, as well as the inaugural women&#x27;s lightweight gold at the 2012 Olympics.

As of 2023, large-scale professional boxing events have not taken place in Ireland since a 2016 gangland shooting at a weigh-in at the Regency hotel in Dublin.

== Athletics ==

Athletics in Ireland is governed by Athletics Ireland, and in Northern Ireland by Athletics Northern Ireland. Athletics has seen some of the Ireland&#x27;s highest performers at the Olympics, with several Irish athletes performing well for both the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland at the games over the years. Denis Horgan won the shot put 13 times at the AAAs, (still holding a title for greatest number of individual titles won), before emigrating to the United States where he won a number of American titles. Horgan also broke the world record on several occasions and silver at the 1908 Olympics. Dr. Pat O&#x27;Callaghan (also from North Cork) won the hammer throw in 1928 and again in 1932 at the Olympic Games. Bob Tisdall also won gold for Ireland in 1932, competing in the 400m hurdles. In the late 20th and early 21st century, notable athletes have included Ron Delany, Mary Peters, John Treacy, Eamonn Coghlan, Sonia O&#x27;Sullivan and Robert Heffernan.

The Dublin Marathon and Belfast Marathon are run annually and are two of the most popular athletics events in the country. The Women&#x27;s Mini Marathon in Dublin consistently gets upwards of 40000 competitors.

== Equestrian ==

The various equestrian sports have a sizeable following in Ireland. After Gaelic games, horse racing is the second most attended sport in the country, with around 1.3 million attendees annually. That is the largest number of horseracing fans in any country on a per capita basis.

The governing body is Horse Sport Ireland (formerly the Equestrian Federation of Ireland), which is composed of 15 Irish affiliate bodies, representing all facets of equestrian sport. These sports include show jumping, eventing, dressage, endurance riding, para-equestrian, polo and carriage driving.

Overall administration of Irish horse-racing is carried out by Horse Racing Ireland. Horse Racing Ireland is responsible for racing in both the Republic of Ireland, which has 24 racecourses, and in Northern Ireland, which has 2 racecourses. Ireland&#x27;s top tracks are the Curragh and Fairyhouse. The breeding industry (including the world&#x27;s largest thoroughbred breeding operation, Coolmore Stud) has produced many top race horses.

== Golf ==
As of the early 21st century, golf is among the most-played sports in the country, with a 2008 report for the Irish Sports Council indicating that golf was then the fourth most popular sport by participation rate. Ireland was the first country to organise the sport on a national basis, with two &quot;oldest governing bodies in world golf&quot;, the Golfing Union of Ireland (GUI) and the Irish Ladies Golf Union (ILGU), being formed in 1891 and 1893 respectively.

There are over 400 golf clubs throughout the island, and over 300 courses in the Republic of Ireland, and (as of 2009) Ireland reportedly had the fourth most golf courses per capita in the world, Among Ireland&#x27;s most famous golf courses are Royal County Down Golf Club, Royal Portrush Golf Club, Portmarnock, Ballybunion and Lahinch. The most prestigious tournament of Ireland is the Irish Open, which is held on courses in the four provinces. Also, the K Club in County Kildare hosted the European Open from 1995 to 2007. Golf is regularly televised in Ireland, with both domestic and international events broadcast.

Ireland produced several top golfers in the late 20th and early 21st century, with players like Pádraig Harrington, Paul McGinley and Shane Lowry achieving significant success internationally. For example, Harrington and McGinley won the World Cup of Golf in 1997 and, together with Clarke, were part of the European team that successfully defended the 2006 Ryder Cup. Harrington also won The Open Championship (British Open) in 2007 and 2008, and the 2008 PGA Championship. Clarke and Lowry won the 2011 Open Championship and 2019 Open Championship respectively.

Three other golfers from Northern Ireland have had international successes in the 21st century. Rory McIlroy has several major tournament wins, including the 2011 U.S. Open. He was world number one in the Official World Golf Ranking for 95 weeks. Graeme McDowell won the 2010 U.S. Open, becoming the first Irish player to do so. Darren Clarke won the 2011 Open Championship.

== Cricket ==
Cricket has been played in Ireland since the early 19th century, and the game against Scotland (a match which has first-class status) has been played annually since 1909.

The sport is organised on an all-island basis and is overseen by the Irish Cricket Union, founded in its present incarnation in 1923. Ireland has entered some domestic English tournaments since the early 1980s, but becoming an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council in 1993 paved the way for participation in international competition. Ireland co-hosted the 1999 Cricket World Cup. It is most popular in Northern Ireland and Dublin.

The Ireland cricket team was among the associate nations that qualified for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. It defeated Pakistan and finished second in its pool, earning a place in the Super 8 stage of the competition. The team also competed in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, and won the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier to secure a place in the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Kevin O&#x27;Brien scored the fastest century in World Cup history (113 runs off 63 balls), as Ireland produced one of the great upsets to defeat England by 3 wickets in the 2011 tournament. In 2017, domestic cricket in Ireland was recognized as first-class cricket for the first time, and was granted Test status in 2017.

Prior to the granting of Test status, a number of Irish cricketers went to England to play Test cricket, including Eoin Morgan from Dublin, who captained the English cricket team to 2019 Cricket World Cup success.

== Field hockey ==

Field hockey (known in Ireland as just &quot;hockey&quot;) is played throughout the country, particularly in secondary schools. The governing body in Ireland is the Irish Hockey Association. The Ireland women&#x27;s national field hockey team reached the final of the Women&#x27;s Hockey World Cup in 2018. As of 2018, the Ireland men&#x27;s national field hockey team were ranked 10th in the FIH World Rankings.

==Other sports==
=== Australian rules football ===
Australian rules football has gained a following in Ireland which has increased mainly due to the International rules series that takes place annually between Australia and Ireland. In October 2000, the Australian Rules Football League of Ireland was established, and a representative Irish team took part in the 2005 Australian Football International Cup.
The Irish Green Machine became inaugural International champions in 2002. They have been finalists in every AFL International Cup since and were 2011 International Cup champions. Belfast and Dublin have been hosts to the AFL Euro Cup.

=== Chess ===
The Irish Chess Union (ICU), formed in 1912, is the governing body for chess in Ireland and a member of FIDE since 1933 and the European Chess Union. The ICU promotes Chess in Ireland and maintains the chess rating for players in Ireland, which are published three times a year. It runs competitions such as the Irish Chess Championship and selects teams to participate in international competitions for Ireland.

=== Croquet ===
Croquet was first played in Ireland in the 1830s. The governing association of the sport is the Croquet Association of Ireland. Most international matches and large tournaments are played at the Carrickmines Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, near Dublin.

=== Cycling ===
There are many regional cycling clubs throughout the country and competitions are organised regularly, the largest non-professional event being the &quot;Rás&quot; (Irish for race). The main governing body is Cycling Ireland which is responsible for cycling throughout the island. Ireland&#x27;s most famous cyclists are Stephen Roche, who won both the Tour de France and Giro d&#x27;Italia in 1987; and Sean Kelly, who won the Vuelta a España in 1988, the sprinter&#x27;s green jersey in the Tour de France four times, the Paris-Nice seven times in succession as well as four of the five &#x27;Monuments&#x27;.
Mountain biking is supported by a number of dedicated trail centers in Wicklow, Dublin, Galway and Tipperary. For competitive mountain bikers, there is a National Cross-Country series, a National Downhill series and a National Enduro series. BMX events are undertaken at the Ratoath BMX track in County Meath, and an indoor BMX track in Cherry Orchard in County Dublin.

=== Darts ===
The Irish National Darts Organisation (INDO) is a governing body for Irish darts and is recognised by the World Darts Federation and British Darts Organisation.

=== Extreme sports ===
Extreme sports undertaken in Ireland include skateboarding, rollerblading, surfing, BMX, mountain biking, mountain boarding, kitesurfing and wakeboarding. Several of these sports have national governing bodies, such as the Irish Surfing Association, and national competitions, such as mountainbiking&#x27;s national series.

Since 2005, skateparks (for skateboarding, rollerblading, and other sports) have been developed in several places, including in Greystones, Bushy park (Dublin) and Lucan (Dublin). Modular parks can be found in other parts of Ireland.

Speed climbing, an Olympic sport as of 2020, is governed by Mountaineering Ireland, which also maintains safety guidelines and training for mountain climbing, indoor climbing, bouldering, abseiling and hill-walking.

=== Greyhound racing ===

Greyhound racing began in Ireland in 1927; there were greyhound races in Celtic Park in Belfast on 18 April of that year and the Shelbourne Park greyhound stadium opened in Dublin four weeks later. Hare coursing was already a well established sport in the country and greyhounds were bred for racing in Ireland from the very start. Mick the Miller, winner of the English Derby in 1929 and 1930, was an Irish greyhound and Ireland continues to export greyhounds.

There are twenty licensed greyhound stadiums in Ireland. There are seventeen in the Republic where the licensing authority is Bord na gCon, the Irish Greyhound Board. This is a semi-state body and was established by the Irish government in 1958. The three stadiums in Northern Ireland are licensed by the Irish Coursing Club, which also organises hare coursing throughout the Island.

=== Gymnastics ===

Gymnastics is governed by Irish Gymnastics, trading as Gymnastics Ireland, which was formed in 1999, following the merging of the Irish Amateur Gymnastics Association and the Irish Sports Acrobatics Federation. There are 83 registered gymnastics clubs in Ireland (including Northern Ireland). Gymnastics includes four Olympic disciplines, women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, trampoline gymnastics, and rhythmic gymnastics, and four non-Olympic disciplines, acrobatic gymnastics, tumbling gymnastics, gymnastics for all, and sports aerobics.

The most successful Irish gymnast is Rhys McClenaghan – winning European, world and Olympic titles. In 2019, he became the first Irish gymnast to qualify for a world championships final and to also win a medal, taking bronze on pommel horse. After contesting the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, at both the 2022 and 2023 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, he won gold for men&#x27;s pommel horse – the first world champion in gymnastics for Ireland. In addition to multiple European championships, at the 2024 Summer Paris Olympics, McClenaghan won gold in the Men&#x27;s pommel horse.

=== Kendo ===
While still a minority sport in Ireland, there are a number of Kendo clubs based in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Cavan. The Irish Kendo Federation is the governing body for the country. The Irish National Kendo Squad participates in the European Kendo Championships and the World Kendo Championships, as well as other international competitions. The main Kendo event in Ireland is the annual Irish National Championships (INC) which takes place in June each year.

Kendo in Northern Ireland is governed by the British Kendo Association (BKA).

=== Martial arts ===
The National Governing Body of Martial Arts in Ireland, as appointed by the Irish Sports Council, is the Irish Martial Arts Commission. The Irish Martial Arts Commission represents the martial arts of Aikido, Ju-Jitsu, Karate, Kendo, Kickboxing, Kung-Fu, TaeKwon-Do, Ninjutsu, Sambo and Tai Chi.

In the early 1960s, diving clubs in the Republic of Ireland formed the Comhairle Fo-Thuinn (CFT) (English: &quot;Irish Underwater Council&quot;). This voluntary body regulates all aspects of diving for its members, is the national governing body recognised by the Irish Government and represents the Republic of Ireland at the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (World Underwater Federation).

The Iroquois team, despite representing the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in which the sport originated, were originally excluded because they did not represent a sovereign nation with an Olympic Committee. The Irish national team refused to take their place at the competition, with the place being allocated to the Iroquois team.

== Competitions and events ==

=== National ===

The various GAA discipline finals are the largest sporting events regularly held in Ireland, in both terms of attendance and media coverage. The biggest national sporting event in Ireland is the final of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, held annually in Croke Park, usually in September. It usually attracts a sell out crowd of 82,500 to the stadium. Many of the matches in the championship attract crowds of 50,000+, depending on who is playing.

Aside from the GAA, the biggest multi-sport event held in Ireland regularly is the Community Games. The games are organised every year from a local level, where hundreds of thousands of young people compete in different disciplines such as athletics, swimming, and cycling, in the first half of the year. Winners progress to county level, and then to the Community Games finals. The finals are held over two weekends in the summer where over 3,000 children sleep over at a campus-style facility.

=== International ===
On an international level, Ireland has had mixed fortunes, with some successes in the late 20th and early 21st century in rugby union, horse racing, show jumping, amateur boxing, and golf.

Twenty four Irish people have won Olympic medals as of 2012. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Ireland had one of its smallest contingents in its history at the games, with only 106 individuals participating. This was due to the strict policy followed by the Olympic Council of Ireland of only allowing &quot;A&quot; time athletes and swimmers to attend the games.

One of the biggest international events in Ireland is international soccer. The Republic&#x27;s national team first qualified for a FIFA World Cup in 1990, reaching the quarter-finals of Italia &#x27;90. In rugby union, as of September 2019, Ireland&#x27;s national team was ranked 1st in the world. Ireland has produced major stars such as Keith Wood, Brian O&#x27;Driscoll and Johnny Sexton. In golf, Ireland has produced several top golfers such as Pádraig Harrington.

The traditional Gaelic games of Gaelic football and hurling are played by Irish expats, with increasingly local involvement in communities around the world, however no nation has enough players to compete with Ireland. To compensate for this the GAA has entered into a partnership with the Australian Football League (Australian rules football) and plays a hybrid annual series called International rules football – this series has been going in various forms since 1967. Also the GAA plays an international hurling hybrid match with Scotland&#x27;s national shinty team (although Ireland do not select players from the best hurling teams in Tier One of the All-Ireland championship for this game).

In 2003, Ireland hosted the Special Olympics World Summer Games, as well as the European SC Championships 2003. In 2006, Ireland hosted the Ryder Cup Matches.

== Stadiums ==
Ireland&#x27;s largest stadium is the GAA&#x27;s Croke Park in Dublin, which can hold 82,300 people. It is the third largest stadium in Europe. Until the late 20th century, it was only used for Gaelic games and concerts. Other GAA facilities capable of accommodating 40,000 or more people are Semple Stadium, Thurles, Gaelic Grounds, Limerick and Páirc Uí Chaoimh, Cork.

International soccer and rugby in the Republic of Ireland are played at the 52,000 capacity Aviva Stadium. Built on the site of the former Lansdowne Road, this all-seated stadium was opened in May 2010. Thomond Park, a rugby ground in Limerick, has been rebuilt into a modern 26,000-capacity stadium, though not all-seated.

Ireland has three Olympic-sized swimming pools – two of which are open to the public. The largest – located at the National Sports Campus – is the National Aquatic Centre. Ireland has several large horse and greyhound tracks such as Fairyhouse.

Plans to develop a Northern Ireland stadium at the site of the former Maze prison in County Antrim to cater for Gaelic games, rugby and soccer were scrapped in 2009 after opposition from unionists and soccer fans.

The Ireland national cricket team play One Day Internationals at Stormont in Belfast and at the Clontarf Cricket Club Ground in Dublin. Ireland also plays Intercontinental Cup matches at the Woodvale Road ground, and has played test cricket at Malahide Cricket Club Ground in Dublin.

<text> is a discussion technique that intends to discredit the opponent&#x27;s argument by attacking the opponent&#x27;s own personal behavior and actions as being inconsistent with their argument, so that the opponent appears hypocritical. This reasoning is a special type of attack. The cites John Cooke&#x27;s 1614 stage play as the earliest known use of the term in the English language.

== Form and explanation ==
The () argument follows the (i.e. pattern):
# Person A claims that statement is true.
# Person B asserts that A&#x27;s actions or past claims are inconsistent with the truth of claim .
# Therefore, is false.

As a specific example, consider the following scenario where Person A and Person B just left a store. 
#Person A: &quot;You took that item without paying for it. What you did is morally wrong!&quot;
#*Here, is the statement: &quot;Stealing from a store is morally wrong.&quot; Person A is asserting that statement is true.
#Person B: &quot;So what? I remember when you once did the same thing. You didn&#x27;t think it was wrong and neither is this.&quot;
#*Person B claims that Person A is a hypocrite because Person A once committed this same action. 
#Person B has argued that because Person A is a hypocrite, he does not have a right to pass sentences on others before judging himself.

=== Other artificial examples ===

The example above was worded in a way to make it amenable to the template given above. However, in language, the technique more often makes an appearance in more subtle and less explicit ways, such as in the following example in which Person B is driving a car with Person A as a passenger:
#Person A: &quot;Stop running so many stop signs.&quot;
#Person B: &quot;You run them all the time!&quot;
Although neither Person A nor Person B explicitly state what is, because of the colloquial nature of the conversation, it is nevertheless understood that statement is something like: &quot;Running stop signs is wrong&quot; or some other statement that is similar in spirit.

Person A and/or Person B are also allowed to be groups of individuals (e.g. organizations, such as corporations, governments, or political parties) rather than individual people. For example, Persons A and B might be governments such as those of the United States and the former Soviet Union, which is the situation that led to the term &quot;whataboutism&quot; with the &quot;And you are lynching Negroes&quot; argument.

The technique can also appear outside of conversations. For example, it is possible for someone who supports a certain Politician B, who recently did something wrong, to justify not changing their support to another politician by reasoning with themselves:
:&quot;Yes, Politician B did do this-or-that immoral thing, but then again so do other politicians. So what&#x27;s the big deal?&quot;
In this example, Person B was &quot;Politician B&quot; while Person A was &quot;other politicians.&quot;

Whataboutism is one particularly well-known modern instance of this technique.

<doc id="1090535" wikidata="Q6083668" url="?curid=1090535" title="Islandia (novel)">
<text>Islandia is a classic novel of utopian fiction by Austin Tappan Wright, a University of California, Berkeley Law School Professor. Written as a hobby over a long period, the manuscript was edited and reduced by about a third by author/editor Mark Saxton with the advice and consent of Wright&#x27;s wife and daughter, and was published first in hardcover format by the company Farrar &amp; Rinehart in 1942, eleven years after the author&#x27;s 1931 death.

&quot;Islandia&quot; is a fully realized imaginary country, though more akin to a utopia than a standard fantasy.

The original Islandia was conceived by Wright when he was a boy. Creating its civilization became his lifelong leisure occupation. The complete Islandia papers include &quot;a detailed history ... complete with geography, genealogy, representations from its literature, language and culture&quot;. The &quot;complete&quot; and never published version of &quot;Islandia&quot; can be found in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. A 61-page &quot;Introduction to Islandia&quot; by Basil Davenport was published along with the original novel in 1942.

The protagonist and narrator of the novel is an American named John Lang, who graduates from Harvard University in 1905. The setting is Islandia, an imaginary country set in the real world of that time. This remote nation &quot;at the tip of the Karain semi-continent&quot; is near &quot;the unexplored wastes of Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere&quot;. The citizens have imposed &quot;the Hundred Law, limiting access to Islandia to a bare one hundred visitors at a time&quot;. Wright may have had in mind both the self-imposed isolation of Siam, starting in 1688, and that of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate.

==Themes==
Islandia&#x27;s culture has many &quot;progressive&quot; features, including the rehabilitation of prostitutes into respectable society, the citizens&#x27; love of nature, and their rural lives. Everyone, including members of the upper classes, engages in some kind of useful work, especially farming. The word for city in Islandian, &quot;elainry&quot;, literally means &quot;place of many people&quot;; all city families have a country home to which they can return.

Like other writers of speculative fiction, Wright decided to imagine a society that differs from ours in one or several major features. One of these is that, while Islandian civilization is primitive technologically, its mores are different from Western culture&#x27;s. Wright wrote much of the story during the 1920s, but set it before World War I, providing a particularly stark contrast between Islandian philosophy and the relatively stern customs of Western countries of the same time. Immersed in the Islandian culture, John Lang steadily increases his understanding of his emotions and his sexual feelings. He becomes accustomed to the slightly more sexually permissive Islandian culture. Wright&#x27;s description may have been intended as a positive comment on the increasing sexual permissiveness of American culture of the 1920s.

Another difference between Islandian culture and the West is that Islandians reject most modern Western technology. It is a rural society with an arcadian philosophy, which Dorn humorously describes as &quot;enlightened Hedonism&quot;. They&#x27;re not interested in building railroads for quick travel. But they do not reject all Western technology; they use a few Western inventions that they judge to be worthwhile, such as modern rifles. At one point, one Islandian uses a sewing machine.

Among John Lang&#x27;s discoveries, he finds that the Islandians use four words for love:

*alia: love of place and family land and lineage (heimat)
*amia: love of friends (philia)
*ania: desire for marriage and commitment (storge)
*apia: sexual attraction (eros)

==Plot==
While an undergraduate at Harvard, John Lang becomes friends with an Islandian fellow-student named Dorn, and decides to learn the Islandian language (of which there are very few speakers outside Islandia). Once he has graduated, his uncle, a prominent businessman, arranges his appointment as American consul to Islandia, based primarily on his ability to speak the language. Gradually John Lang learns that his tacit mission as American consul is to do whatever is necessary to increase American trade opportunities in Islandia. He does not begin this mission right away, preferring to get to know the country and the people first.

John Lang meets and becomes infatuated with Dorn&#x27;s sister, Dorna. They spend some time together alone, which John finds unnerving at first, since they are not chaperoned. When Dorna comes to understand John&#x27;s feelings, she tells him that she does not love him in return in that way (though he wonders whether she means &quot;cannot&quot;, or &quot;will not&quot;). She accepts the marriage proposal of the King instead, a handsome young man who has been courting her for some time.

One of the culminations of the plot is the decision by the people of Islandia to reject the demands of the Great Powers for unrestricted trade and immigration, choosing instead to maintain their tradition of isolation. As this political struggle intensifies, John Lang sympathizes with the Islandians, to the great disappointment of many American businessmen who desire new lucrative trade opportunities, including John Lang&#x27;s uncle.

Near the end of the novel, John Lang is allowed to become a citizen of Islandia as a reward for heroism during an attack by a neighboring group. He later falls in love with an American friend with whom he has maintained steady correspondence. They decide to marry, and when she arrives in Islandia she, too, is granted citizenship.

==Sequels==
There are also three sequels/prequels, all written by Mark Saxton, the man who edited the original &quot;Islandia&quot; manuscript. Reviewers describe these books as entertaining and self-contained. The prequels concern events that are mentioned briefly in the original novel, and are likely based on Wright&#x27;s unpublished notes. All three books were published with the permission of Wright&#x27;s estate. Sylvia Wright, Wright&#x27;s daughter and the executrix of the estate, died shortly before the third Saxton book was completed, and there have been no additional books since.

* &quot;The Islar, Islandia Today - A Narrative of Lang III&quot;. Published in 1969, this book is set in the then-present day. The plot concerns a coup attempt in Islandia that occurs while the national government is debating whether to join the United Nations. The protagonist, as indicated in the title, is John Lang&#x27;s grandson.
* &quot;The Two Kingdoms&quot;, published in 1979, is a prequel set in the 14th century. The plot concerns the events surrounding the reign of the only female ruler in Islandian history, and the dynastic change that ensued from this.
* &quot;Havoc in Islandia&quot;, published in 1982, is yet another prequel, set in the 12th century. The Roman Catholic Church attempts to overthrow the government of Islandia, and, having failed, is itself expelled from the country (parallel to the expulsion of Christians from Japan).

==Cultural references==
&quot;Islandia&quot; is mentioned briefly as a modern instance of myth in &quot;Hamlet&#x27;s Mill&quot; (p. 51), along with &quot;The Islar&quot;.

&quot;Islandian&quot; kinds of love are mentioned by Ursula K. Le Guin in her novel &quot;Always Coming Home&quot;, though she only mentions three of the four kinds (&quot;ania&quot;, &quot;apia&quot; and &quot;alia&quot;).

<text>Gardens of the Moon is a high fantasy novel by in Canadian author Steven Erikson&#x27;s. Published on April 1, 1999, it is the first of ten novels in the series the &quot;Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot;.

The novel details the various struggles for power on an intercontinental region dominated by the Malazan Empire. It is notable for the use of high magic, and unusual plot structure. &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; centres around the campaign of the Malazan Empire forces to conquer the city of Darujhistan on the continent of Genabackis.

It was nominated for a World Fantasy Award. It received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising the tone, characters, and overarching story.

== Development ==

Erikson and Ian C. Esslemont initially devised the Malazan world as a backdrop for a table-top role-playing game. Unhappy with the lack of quality adult oriented fantasy movies at the time, the duo decided to write their own movie script using their gaming experience and the world they had created. The script, titled &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot;, was deemed too risky and failed to sell. With interest in the script seeming nonexistent, Erikson, with Esslemont&#x27;s go ahead, reworked it into a fantasy novel, which he completed around 1991–92.
After meeting almost a decade of rejection, the novel was finally sold to Transworld, a division of Random House. The publisher was pleased with the work and requested additional books in the series. Using the history of the Malazan world, nine additional novels were plotted. After the publication of &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot;, reviews spread via the internet, and Orion publications attempted to lure the writer away from Transworld. However, Transworld retained an option on additional novels in the series and offered £675,000 for the remaining nine books of the series.

==Plot==

===Prologue===
The novel begins in the 96th year of the Malazan Empire, marking the twilight of Emperor Kellanved&#x27;s reign. Ganoes Paran, at the age of 12, witnesses the devastating attack on the Mouse Quarter in Malaz City. Paran aspires to become a soldier in the future, despite the veteran soldier Whiskeyjack&#x27;s reservations.

===Genabackis===
Seven years later, the Emperor and his ally, Dancer, have been assassinated and supplanted by the chief of the assassin corps. Empress Laseen now rules with the aid of the Claw, the imperial assassins. The story opens several years into a series of wars by the Malazan Empire to conquer the continent of Genabackis.

Under High Fist Dujek, the Malazan 2nd Army has been besieging the city of Pale, one of only two Free Cities left in the Malazans&#x27; path in Genabackis, for several years. Pale is holding out thanks to an alliance with the powerful Anomander Rake, Lord of Moon&#x27;s Spawn (a floating fortress), leader of the non-human Tiste Andii race. Pale finally falls when Rake withdraws his fortress following a fierce battle. Even then, the Empire suffers severe losses, including the near-total destruction of a legendary elite unit in its 2nd army, known as the Bridgeburners. Several characters speculate that someone higher up within the Empire may be engineering the elimination of various people who were loyal to the late Emperor.

The Empire then turns its attention to the last remaining Free City, Darujhistan. A handful of surviving members of the Bridgeburners, led by Sergeant Whiskeyjack, now severely reduced in rank after Laseen&#x27;s seizure of power, are sent to try to undermine the city from within. Once there, they attempt fruitlessly to contact the city&#x27;s assassins&#x27; guild, in the hope of paying them to betray their city, but Rake has already driven the guild underground. Adjunct Lorn, second-in-command to the Empress, is sent to uncover something in the hills east of Darujhistan. She is accompanied by Onos Toolan, a T&#x27;lan Imass, an undead race that once dominated the world before humans. Meanwhile, Tattersail, one of the few mages to survive the Siege of Pale, and Paran, now a Captain and the Bridgeburners&#x27; nominal commander, head toward the city to determine the reason for the increased involvement of several gods and other magical forces in the campaign.

A group of con-artists and underworld figures within Darujhistan work to oppose members of the civic government who are considering capitulating to the Empire. Meanwhile, Anomander Rake offers his alliance to the true rulers of Darujhistan, a secretive cabal of mages. The plots collide when Adjunct Lorn releases a Jaghut Tyrant, a powerful ancient being, with the aim of either damaging Anomander Rake seriously or forcing him to withdraw from the city. The Tyrant is eventually imprisoned inside an Azath House after a fierce battle with Rake&#x27;s people, while Rake himself defeats a demon lord that Lorn releases inside the city.

A substantial subplot involves a young Bridgeburner named Sorry. She is known as a cold-blooded killer but is in fact possessed by Cotillion, also known as the Rope, a deity and patron of assassins. When Cotillion&#x27;s partner Shadowthrone and Rake negotiate the Rope&#x27;s withdrawal from the events of war, Sorry is freed and falls in with Crokus, a young Daru thief. Crokus has earned the patronage of Oponn, the twin Gods of Chance, who continue to meddle in the conflict for their own purposes. As the novel ends, Crokus, a Bridgeburner sapper named Fiddler, and the Bridgeburner assassin Kalam volunteer to take Sorry (now called Apsalar) back to her homeland of Itko Kan (their story continues in &quot;Deadhouse Gates&quot;).

Meanwhile, Dujek and Whiskeyjack lead the 2nd Army into rebellion against Laseen&#x27;s increasingly tyrannical rule. Dujek now seeks an alliance with Rake and other enemies of Malazan against a holy war called by the Pannion Seer, whose empire is advancing from the south-east of Genabackis. Elsewhere, it is confirmed that the continent of Seven Cities has begun a mass uprising against the Empire. These and other plot developments are continued in the third novel, &quot;Memories of Ice&quot;.

==Styles and themes==
In a 2000 interview with &quot;SFSite&quot;, Erikson says that a large part of Gardens of the Moon involved the dismantling of various conventions of the fantasy genre. He admits his fascination with ambivalence and ambiguity and says that notion of evil for its own sake, with &quot;good heroes and insipidly stupid bad guys&quot;, is boring. Reviewers have noted Erikson&#x27;s penchant of avoiding &quot;fairy tale distinctions between good and evil&quot;, with numerous factions in the novel that cannot exclusively be considered as either. Themes such as history, myth creation and war have also been considered.

==Publication history==
The novel was first released by Bantam in UK and Canada as a trade paperback edition followed by a mass market paperback in March 2000. In 2004, Tor released the novel in both hardcover and paperback editions in the US. Both publishers released the novel&#x27;s tenth anniversary hardcover edition in 2009. It has also been released in the audiobook and ebook formats. Subterranean Press published 500 copies of a signed numbered hardcover edition and 52 copies of a signed, deluxe bound lettered edition, illustrated by Michael Komarck, in 2008.

The novel has also been translated into multiple languages including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Portuguese and Turkish.

==Reception== 
The novel received mixed to positive reviews from critics. &quot;SFSite&quot; said that Erikson had created &quot;a fantasy world as rich and detailed as any you&#x27;re likely to encounter&quot; while calling the novel engrossing and hard to set aside. The reviewer, while calling it an astounding debut fantasy novel with a fully realized history spanning thousands of years and rich, complex characters, notes that the complexity could also be considered the book&#x27;s greatest flaw. Bill Capossere of Tor said that, though the novel is not without its flaws, it is a captivating, stimulating read that defies the reader&#x27;s preconceptions of fantasy and challenges their ideas of fantasy by confronting them with reality.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; described Erikson&#x27;s world-building as astounding and also praised the character development, stating &quot;His characters ... feel realistic, and their personalities actually change and adapt through the story.&quot; It also praised the deep and complex plot of the novel. In contrast, however, the reviewer criticized the pacing as awful though noted that the climactic finale was neatly done. Another reviewer has praised Erikson for breathing new life into the fantasy genre with his new ideas and creations, calling the novel &quot;a work of great skill and beauty.&quot; &quot;Salon&quot; describes Erikson as a &quot;master of lost and forgotten epochs, a weaver of ancient epics&quot; while praising his realistic world-building and characterization.

On the other hand, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; criticized the novel&#x27;s characterization and lack of real depth, stating that &quot;The fast-moving plot, with sieges, duels (of sword and of spell), rebellions, intrigue and revenge, unearthed monsters and earth-striding gods, doesn&#x27;t leave much room for real depth. Heroes win, villains lose, fairness reigns, tragedy is averted. Erikson may aspire to China Miéville heights, but he settles comfortably in George R.R. Martin country.&quot;

&quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; also garnered praise from well-known authors in the fantasy genre, such as Stephen R. Donaldson who said &quot;Erikson is an extraordinary writer. I read &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; with great pleasure.&quot; J. V. Jones praised Erikson&#x27;s style and his ability to &quot;create a world every bit as intricate and messy as our own.&quot; Adam Roberts also praised Erikson&#x27;s world-building and characterization, calling the novel &quot;fiendishly readable&quot;.

<doc id="1090542" wikidata="Q7342072" url="?curid=1090542" title="Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven">
<text>Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven PC (20 October 1660 – 26 July 1723), &quot;styled&quot; 17th Baron Willoughby de Eresby between 1666 and 1701, and known as 4th Earl of Lindsey between 1701 and 1706, and as 1st Marquess of Lindsey between 1706 and 1715, was a British statesman and nobleman.

==Early life==
Bertie was the eldest son of Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey and, his second wife, the Hon. Elizabeth Wharton, daughter of Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton. Among his younger brothers were Hon. Peregrine Bertie (the Vice Chamberlain to King William III and to Queen Anne, Teller of the Exchequer), Hon. Philip Bertie (Auditor of the Duchy of Cornwall, who married Lady Elizabeth Brabazon, eldest daughter of William Brabazon, 3rd Earl of Meath), Hon. Norris Bertie (a Lt. of the Royal Navy), and Hon. Albemarle Bertie (MP who also served as Auditor of the Duchy of Cornwall. Among his sisters were Lady Jane Bertie (wife of Maj.-Gen. Edward Mathew, Governor of Grenada), Lady Caroline Bertie (second wife of Capt. George Dewar). From his father&#x27;s first marriage to Mary (née Massingberd) Berkeley (widow of Hon. George Berkeley and second daughter John Massingberd, Treasurer of the East India Company), he had an elder half-sister, Lady Arabella Bertie (second wife Thomas Savage, 3rd Earl Rivers).

His paternal grandparents were Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey, and the former Martha Cokayne. Among his large extended family were uncles Peregrine, Richard, Vere, and Charles Bertie, and aunts Lady Elizabeth (wife of the 3rd Viscount Campden) and Lady Bridget (wife of the 1st Duke of Leeds). His mother was the only child of Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton and the former Elizabeth Wandesford (daughter of Sir Rowland Wandesford of Pickhill, an attorney of the Court of Wards and Liveries).

==Career==

Lord Willoughby entered Parliament as Member of Parliament for Boston in 1685, and sat in the Loyal Parliament, from 1685 to 1687, and the Convention Parliament from 1689 to 1690. He was commissioned captain of an independent troop of horse raised to suppress the Monmouth Rebellion on 20 June 1685. In 1688, Bertie took part in the northern rising led by his kinsman, the Earl of Danby, in favour of William of Orange. He was rewarded with the chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1689, a post which enabled him to secure a seat at Preston at the general election of 1690.

In 1690, he was returned for Preston, but was soon forced to leave the House of Commons for the House of Lords after receiving a writ of acceleration as Baron Willoughby de Eresby. Lord Willougby inherited the earldom of Lindsey on his father&#x27;s death in 1701, and was invested a Privy Counsellor one month later; along with the Earldom of Lindsey, he also inherited the offices of Lord Great Chamberlain and Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, both of which he would hold until his death and would pass onto his son, the 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven.

Lord Lindsey, as he was now styled, was then created Marquess of Lindsey in 1706, and was finally created Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven in 1715, with a special remainder failing the heirs male of his body, to the heirs male of the body of his father, Robert, late Earl of Lindsey, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of Philip, Lord Wharton. Also in 1715, he temporarily served as a Lord Justice.

In 1715, he employed Sir John Vanbrugh to design a baroque front to his house at Grimsthorpe to celebrate his ennoblement as first Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. This was in addition to the London mansion, Lindsey House, at 59-60 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, built for the Bertie family in 1640.

==Personal life==
On 30 July 1678, Lord Willoughby married Mary Wynn (d. 1689), a Welsh heiress and direct descendant of the princely house of Aberffraw. She was the daughter, and sole heiress, of Sir Richard Wynn, 4th Baronet of Gwydyr Estate and the former Sarah Myddelton (daughter of Sir Thomas Myddelton of Chirk Castle). They had five children, including:

* Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby (1683–1704), who died while studying at the Wolfenbüttel Ritter-Akademie
* Peregrine Bertie, 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven (1686–1742), who married Jane Brownlow, third daughter of Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet.
* Lady Elizabeth Bertie, who died unmarried.
* Lady Eleanor Bertie, who died unmarried.
* Lady Mary Bertie, who died unmarried.

After the death of his first wife in 1689, he married Albinia Farington on 6 July 1705. She was a daughter of Maj.-Gen. William Farington of Chislehurst and the former Theodosia Betenson (sister and co-heiress of Sir Edward Betenson, 1st Baronet). Together, they were the parents of:

* Lord Vere Bertie (d. 1768), an MP for Boston who married Ann Casey, illegitimate daughter of Sir Cecil Wray, 11th Baronet, in 1736.
* Capt. Lord Montagu Bertie (d. 1753), who married Elizabeth Piers, daughter of William Piers, MP in 1758.
* Capt. Lord Thomas Bertie (1720–1749)
* Lt.-Gen. Lord Robert Bertie (1721–1782), the Governor of Cork who married Hon. Mary (née Blundell) Raymond, widow of Robert Raymond, 2nd Baron Raymond and third daughter of Montague Blundell, 1st Viscount Blundell, in 1762.
* Lady Louisa Bertie, who married Thomas Bludworth, Gentleman of the Horse to the Prince of Wales and a Groom of the Bedchamber, in 1736.

Lord Ancaster died in July 1723, aged 62, an established but relatively unheralded statesman. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Peregrine. His widow remarried to James Douglas and died in 1745.

===Descendants===

Through his son Lord Vere, he was a grandfather of Albinia Bertie (wife of George Hobart, 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire) and Louisa Bertie (wife of Lt.-Gen. Hon. Sir Charles Stuart, Governor of Minorca and fourth son of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute).

Through his son Lord Montagu, he was a grandfather of Augusta Bertie, who married John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland.

<doc id="1090544" wikidata="Q570102" url="?curid=1090544" title="Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black">
<text>Apocalypse 91… The Enemy Strikes Black is the fourth studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy, released on October 1, 1991, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records. The album received critical acclaim, ranking at No. 2 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1991 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Apocalypse 91&quot; was recorded at The Mix Palace in Long Island, New York and produced by The Bomb Squad and The Imperial Grand Ministers of Funk, which consisted of producers Stuart Robertz (fictional), Cerwin &quot;C-Dawg&quot; Depper (fictional), Gary &quot;G-Wiz&quot; Rinaldo, and The JBL. The album title is an allusion to the titles of the films &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

The group would take a new direction with their sound, partly out of necessity. According to Hank Shocklee, around this time, the disks for every track they had been working on for the past four to five years had been stolen. As a result, they had to rush to re-create their music and to put out their album in a timely manner. Shocklee admitted that it was impossible to completely recover what they had lost, saying &quot;once you lose all your data, it&#x27;s very difficult to get that data back...you may get some of it back, but you&#x27;ll never get the complete set. You won&#x27;t even know what the complete set is, because there&#x27;s data in there you didn&#x27;t really know you had.&quot; In retrospect, he believed the loss &quot;stunted [Public Enemy&#x27;s] growth. We never really recovered after that. We was on a roll—I was on a roll, and to lose that material set me back so hard.&quot; As a result, the sound was a little leaner than the dense production of their previous albums, and live musicians became a prominent element as well.

The group recorded &quot;1 Million Bottlebags&quot; to protest the pervasiveness of malt liquor in the African-American community. Public Enemy collaborated with the metal band Anthrax to record a thrash version of their earlier single &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==
The album was released on October 1, 1991, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records. &quot;Apocalypse 91&quot; produced four singles: &quot;Can&#x27;t Truss It&quot;, &quot;Nighttrain&quot;, &quot;Shut &#x27;Em Down&quot; and its B-side &quot;By the Time I Get to Arizona&quot;. The latter featured a controversial music video where Public Enemy was depicted killing the 17th Governor of Arizona, Evan Mecham, who refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday as a national holiday. &quot;Can&#x27;t Truss It&quot; was Public Enemy&#x27;s most successful single, peaking at No. 9 on the Hot Soul Singles chart and at No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The song also peaked at No. 5 on the Dance chart, becoming their most successful release there.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Apocalypse 91&quot; earned critical acclaim. Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised its production and lyrics, stating that &quot;Apocalypse 91&quot; &quot;attempts nothing short of setting a sociopolitical agenda for the black community.&quot; Similarly, Ronin Ro of &quot;The Source&quot; highlighted Chuck D&#x27;s powerful and focused lyrics as well as the uncompromising and raw nature of the album. In &quot;Playboy&quot;, prominent critic Robert Christgau highlighted the first half of the album, calling it &quot;Public Enemy&#x27;s most exciting sustained sequence ever&quot;, while criticizing the second half for being less consistent, although altogether enduring in the same way as the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (1969). &quot;NME&quot;″s Ian McCann credited &quot;Apocalypse 91&quot; for its &quot;totally brutal and funky&quot; music, but was disappointed that it rarely deviates from its forceful approach, despite the &quot;sharp intelligence&quot; of its lyrics.

&quot;&quot;Apocalypse &#x27;91&quot; is great rather than classic because you can&#x27;t make four classic albums in a row…&quot; observed the hip-hop fanzine &quot;Louder Than A Bomb!&quot;. &quot;PE are still the best band in America and they&#x27;ve once again made the best album of the year.&quot;

&quot;Apocalypse 91&quot; was ranked at No. 2 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1991 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, behind Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, while editors of &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it 7th in their list of 20 Best Albums of the Year. Retrospectively, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cites the album as one of the great records of golden age hip hop. The record was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black&quot; debuted at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and at number one on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. On November 26, 1991, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies in the United States.

<doc id="1090546" wikidata="Q2713387" url="?curid=1090546" title="Underground Network">
<text>Underground Network is Anti-Flag&#x27;s third studio album, released on Fat Wreck Chords in 2001. Widely considered to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, it helped make Anti-Flag a household name in the U.S. punk scene with tracks such as &quot;Underground Network,&quot; &quot;Bring Out Your Dead,&quot; and &quot;Stars and Stripes.&quot;

The title &quot;This Machine Kills Fascists&quot; pays tribute to folk-music hero Woody Guthrie, who had a guitar labeled with the same slogan.

Underground Network was removed from Spotify in 2023 following the several rape and sexual assault allegations made against Sane. 

== Background ==
In 2000, Anti-Flag went on the Vans Warped Tour, where they met Fat Mike, head of Fat Wreck Chords. The band had originally tried to get their previous album, A New Kind of Army, released on the label, but Mike had turned them down, offering to release it on Honest Don&#x27;s Records due to the band being different than the other bands on Fat. Instead, the band released the album on Go-Kart Records and A-F Records, their own label. Mike told them on the tour that he had been impressed with them turning him down, and offered to release their next album on Fat. The band accepted, and they went into the studio in November of that year to start recording. Having co-produced their last 2 albums with Joe West, the band asked Squirtgun bassist and producer Mass Giorgini to produce the album, in order to make them sound better. According to Justin, &quot;I could write half decent songs. The problem was that we couldn&#x27;t play them very well. Luckily...Mass Giorgini found a way to help us sound like better musicians than we were at the time.&quot;

== Writing and Recording ==
The band worked on the album throughout November, and January through February. Mass had originally told Pat that it would take about an hour to record each song, although it took the band three months to finish it. All of the songs were recorded at Giorigini&#x27;s studio, Sonic Iguana Studios. Musically, the album is heavier than their previous albums. The album&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by the writings of Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, and Matthew Rothschild. This is the first album to feature material written by Chris #2, as the bass parts on the last album had already been written by the time he joined the band. The album is also the first to include political essays in the booklet, which would become a fixture in most of their future albums.

== Music ==
Angry, Young and Poor is similar to the song Born to Die, off of Their System Doesn&#x27;t Work for You, and features commentary on the problems facing the American Youth. This Machine Kills Fascists is a hardcore style song that attacks the Neo-Nazi punks who had tried to infiltrate the Pittsburgh punk scene. The title track is a slower, more melodic track and features a guitar solo from Justin. The song criticizes American Mainstream Media, and calls for the use of alternative news media.

Daddy Warbux is the first song to feature Chris #2 singing lead vocals, and is a straight-forward punk song. Vieques, Puerto Rico draws attention to the US Government&#x27;s use of Puerto Rico for military training and munitions testing, and the protests by the citizens there against the practice. Stars and Stripes is another slower track that features an ongoing bass riff backed by heavy power chords. Watch the Right is a warning against center-right politicians that try to masquerade as liberals. The Panama Deception is the heaviest song on the record, and mentions the 1997 movie Wag the Dog, while connecting it to the Bush-led Invasion of Panama in 1989. Culture Revolution also features a guitar solo from Justin, and calls for a revolution against the apathy and consumerism pushed by the media.

Spaz&#x27;s House Destruction Party was based on an actual party that the band had been a part of in 1994. The band&#x27;s friend, Spaz, had organized a three day party to commemorate being evicted, and the house was destroyed after only one night, which resulted in the police being called. Spaz would make an appearance on the band&#x27;s next album, Mobilize, where he was featured on a live version of the song and explained some of the inaccuracies in the song.

Bring Out Your Dead was the first song Chris wrote for the band. He later said that he was inspired to write the song after watching Ralph Nader speak on C-SPAN. A part of Nader&#x27;s speech would be included in the track. The song also features Chris using screaming vocals, which would also be a feature in future Anti-Flag songs. A Start is similar to The Panama Deception, and accuses schools of taking away students&#x27; creativity and individuality, and for not teaching about important historical events.

Until It Happens to You was written back in 1998 and performed while the band was on tour in Canada, when Jamie Towns was still playing in the band. Justin dedicated the song to &quot;political prisoners like Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu-Jamal&quot;.

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
*Justin Sane - guitar, lead vocals on tracks 1–3, 5–10, 12, 13
*Chris Head - guitar, backing vocals
*Chris #2 (credited as #2 Chris) - bass guitar, lead vocals on tracks 4 and 11
*Pat Thetic - drums

== Legacy ==
Angry, Young and Poor, This Machine Kills Fascists, Underground Network, and Spaz&#x27;s House Destruction Party would be included in the band&#x27;s compilation album A Document of Dissent, released in 2014. Underground Network and Spaz&#x27;s House Destruction Party would be included as live tracks on the band&#x27;s next album, Mobilize. Spaz&#x27;s House Destruction Party would also be included in the band&#x27;s live album Live Vol 2, along with Angry, Young and Poor.

The band would rerecord Bring Out Your Dead for their 20 Years of Hell series. Chris #2 has also frequently played the song during his Instagram live streams.

Chris #2 said in a live video on Instagram that Spaz&#x27;s House Destruction Party was one of the most requested songs the band would get while on tour, but said that they didn&#x27;t like playing it live because it was &quot;too long&quot;.
