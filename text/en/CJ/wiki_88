<text>Brading Marshes nature reserve is the only Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) reserve on the Isle of Wight, England. Situated on the east coast of the Island, behind Bembridge Harbour, it was acquired in 2001 and is a mix of lagoons and ditches, reed beds and meadows, with a fringe of ancient woodland. This marsh is the site of a wetland restoration project by the RSPB.

The land was reclaimed from the sea for agricultural use at the end of the 19th century. Today, grazing, haymaking and cutting rough vegetation encourage flowers and wetland birds.

In spring and summer, lapwing, grey heron, tufted duck and shelduck can be seen. Marsh harrier and peregrines can also be seen. During autumn and winter migrating wading birds pass through, joining ducks, geese and wading birds feeding in the pools. The reserve is also home to many insects, plants and other animals.

The reserve is open all year round and free to visit.

Brading Marshes is included within Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called &quot;Brading Marshes to St. Helen&#x27;s Ledges&quot;. The RSPB is thus one of the owners of land within the area designated as &quot;Brading Marshes to St. Helen&#x27;s Ledges&quot; SSSI.

<text>Mayfield is an unincorporated community in Grand Traverse County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located in Paradise Township between Kingsley and Traverse City along South Garfield Road (County Road 611). As an unincorporated community, Mayfield has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own.

== History ==
The land on which Mayfield sits has long been territory under the Council of Three Fires; the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi.

In 1868, a sawmill was built upon Swainston Creek, a tributary of the Boardman River. Later, a grist mill was built, and the settlement was named Beulah. However, in 1869, the community was awarded a post office under the name of Mayfield, named after the adjacent township. In 1872, a line of the Pennsylvania Railroad was extended from Cadillac via Walton and Mayfield to Traverse City.

In 1922, Leonard Halladay, a Michigan fly tyer from Mayfield, conceived the popular Adams Fly as a general mayfly imitation. It was first fished by an Ohio attorney and friend of Halladay, Judge Charles F. Adams on the Boardman River near Traverse City. Charles Adams reported his success with the fly to Halladay who named the fly after his friend. For this reason, Mayfield is known as the &quot;Birthplace of the Adams Fly&quot;.

In 1961, Mayfield Pond, the small impoundment on Swainston Creek, was washed out in a rainstorm, subsequently leading to the failure of the Keystone Dam, upstream on the Boardman River. In 1987, the pond nearly failed again, but a washout was prevented.

<doc id="1111788" wikidata="Q309645" url="?curid=1111788" title="Guillermo Stábile">
<text>Guillermo Stábile (17 January 1905 – 26 December 1966) was an Argentine professional football player and manager who played as a centre forward. At club level, Stábile won two national championships with Huracán and played in Italy and France. He was the top scorer of the 1930 FIFA World Cup, the inaugural iteration of the tournament. As manager, he led Argentina to victory at six South American Championships and Racing Club to three league titles.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Stábile was born in Parque Patricios, Buenos Aires. He began his career with local club Sportivo Metán and from 1920, with Huracán. In 1924, he progressed to the first team which played in Argentina&#x27;s top league, which then still had amateur status. He started out on the right wing but soon evolved into a centre forward. Stábile won many competitions with Huracán, most notably the championships of 1925 and 1928 and the regional trophy &quot;Copa Dr. Carlos Ibarguren&quot; in 1925.

===Genoa===
After capturing the world&#x27;s attention with his impressive feats in the First World Cup, he was signed by Genoa. He instantly became a fan favourite, scoring a hat-trick on his debut against rivals Bologna. He stayed with the Genoan club for five years, playing 41 games and scoring 16 goals.

===Napoli===
During the 1935–36 season, he moved to Napoli with Antonio Vojak transferring the other way to Genoa. This was during the era where with Attila Sallustro another South American legend played for Napoli. The club finished 8th in the league with Stábile scoring three goals in twenty games.

===Red Star Paris===
As a last act of his playing career, Stábile moved to Red Star Paris in Paris, the club founded by Jules Rimet, who took the initiative to the FIFA World Cup, first played in 1930. He stayed with the club until 1939 with the last honour of his playing career being helping the club achieve promotion, from Division 2 back into Division 1. He also served as player-manager for the club.

==International career==

Stábile made his debut for the Argentina national team at the age of 25, in his team&#x27;s second match in the first ever FIFA World Cup held in 1930 in Uruguay. He did not play in Argentina&#x27;s first match of the competition against France.

His debut came in the following game against Mexico, because the first choice striker Roberto Cherro couldn&#x27;t play due to an anxiety attack. The game finished 6–3 to Argentina, with Stábile scoring a hat-trick on his debut. This was long thought to be the first World Cup hat-trick, until 76 years later on 10 November 2006 world football&#x27;s governing body FIFA declared that Bert Patenaude had scored the first hat-trick two days prior to Stábile.

The final game of the group stages saw Argentina facing South American rivals Chile. They won the game 3–1 with Stábile scoring twice, meaning that Argentina had qualified for the semi-finals, against the United States. The South Americans breezed through, with a 6–1 victory; Stábile added two more goals to his account and securing Argentina a place in the finals.

On 30 July 1930, the first ever World Cup final took place, between Argentina and Uruguay. At half time Argentina led 2–1, Stábile having scored the second goal. However, they went on to lose 4–2.

Despite losing the final, Stábile made history, becoming the top scorer in the first ever FIFA World Cup, with his tally of 8 goals in 4 games. It turned out that he would never play for Argentina again, and thus he scored in every game he played for his country, with an average of two goals per match.

==Managerial career==

Stábile had received his first taste of managing, way back in the 1931–32 season at Genoa, long before he retired from playing. Here he spent the aforementioned season as a co-manager, alongside Luigi Burlando.

After a year at Red Star Paris, he became player-manager for the club; this included the season in which they were promoted from Ligue 2. Stábile left the French club, to coach the Argentina national team. He began his spell in 1939.

Stábile coached Argentina to six South American Championship trophies: in 1941, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1955 and 1957. After the first round exit at the 1958 World Cup, where Argentina lost the last of its three matches with 1–6 to Czechoslovakia, his time with the national side came to a halt. He was called back to the helm of Argentina in 1960 and he led Argentina in the third and last edition of the Panamerican Football Championship, which took place in Costa Rica.

With the Argentina national side, as a coach (just as he had as a player) Stábile, set records; he coached the national team in 123 official matches gaining 83 victories, making him one of the few coaches with more than 100 international matches in charge.

While managing the national side, he also had spells coaching three other clubs, first the club where he began his career, Huracán and then later Ferro and Racing Club. He led Racing to three consecutive championships between 1949 and 1951.

Stábile retired from management in 1960 to take up the role of director of the Argentina national school of football managing, a post he held, until his death in 1966.

<text>The New Revolutionary Alternative (; NRA) was a Russian far-left terrorist organisation, allegedly active during the late 1990s.

==History==
During the late 1990s, several bombing attacks were carried out against the Federal Security Service (FSB) by far-left activists of the Russian Communist Workers Party (RCWP), who had become disillusioned with the post-Soviet government of Russia. In 1998, RCWP member Alexander Biryukov carried out a bombing attack against the FSB. In April 1999, four women affiliated with the RCWP carried out a bombing of the Lubyanka Building, the headquarters of the FSB in Moscow. The latter bombing was allegedly carried out in protest against the carpet bombing of Grozny during the Second Chechen War. Following these attacks, the FSB announced the existence of a new far-left terrorist organisation, the &quot;New Revolutionary Alternative&quot;, which the FSB held responsible for the bombings. In 2001, it was reported that NRA had also set off bombs in Moscow military offices (Ostankino in 1996 and Cheryomushkinsky in 1997). 

In 2003, Nadezhda Raks, Olga Nevskaya, Larisa Romanova, and Tatiana Nekhorosheva-Sokolova were found guilty of the bombings. Romanova&#x27;s sentence was later commuted. Alexander Biryukov was declared incompetent to stand trial and was sent to a psychiatric hospital.

==Legacy==
The New Revolutionary Alternative has since become associated with anarchism and has been listed alongside other anarchist terrorist groups of the late 20th century, such as the German 2 June Movement and the Italian . The Combat Organization of Anarcho-Communists (BOAK) has cited the NRA as an inspiration for its attacks against Russian rail infrastructure following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>Mighty Beanz was a collectable children&#x27;s toy line of plastic beans created by Moose Enterprises in Melbourne, Australia. The primary Mighty Beanz game is to race the Beanz down different types of battle stages.

== History ==

=== Original line ===
The Mighty Beanz line was originally launched in Australia at the beginning of 2002 and found their way to United States markets that summer. Five series were created:
* “Series 1” included 60 Beanz (1-60) divided into teams of five, along with a red carrying case. 
* “Series 2” introduced 70 all new Mighty Beanz (60-130). Again, these were divided into teams of five with some beans able to glow in the dark. Blue carrying case.
* “Series 3” produced only 60 new Mighty Beanz (131-190). Pairs (2 Beanz in one team). This line of Beanz introduced color changing abilities, along with a new green carrying case.
* “Series 4” produced another 60 Mighty Beanz (191-250). This time around, the Beanz were arranged into teams of three and also introduced a new Mega Bean, which was substantially larger than the others. Purple carrying case.
* “Series 5” came with a new name for the Mighty Beanz called Bean Bodz. There were 60 Bean Bodz produced (1-60) bringing the total number of collectibles to 310. This time Beanz weren&#x27;t divided into some teams, every bean had assigned rubber body. Unfortunately, no carrying case.
Furthermore, Moose Enterprises has portrayed several famous celebrities in the shape of their toy, including Elvis Presley, Hulk Hogan and Steve Irwin.

Besides Mighty Beanz, Moose Enterprises also manufactured three Mighty Beanz racetracks to go along with their toys, Ultimate Jump Park, Collision Chaos, and Super S-Bend. Each track came with two limited edition Beanz that did not have printed numbers on them, making them extremely collectible.

In 2004, a Mighty Beanz video game titled &quot;Mighty Beanz Pocket Puzzles&quot; was released for the Game Boy Advance.

=== 2010 relaunch ===
2010 marked the first relaunch of Mighty Beanz. From 2010 through 2012 Moose would launch a total of five more series of Mighty Beanz. Though, series 3 would mark the last series to be released in countries like the United States as series 4 and series 5 could only be found in Australia and a few other countries, making it more difficult for collectors to obtain certain Beanz. Each series of the relaunched Mighty Beanz also had their own limited edition Moose Bean with only 1000 of them made for each series. Five series were created:
* “Series 1” included 100 Beanz (1-116) divided into teams of five, with 16 special edition Beanz that were made available through various other Mighty Beanz series 1 products bringing the total to collect up to 116. The Mega Bean had also made a return from the original line of Mighty Beanz.
* “Series 2” included 100 Beanz (117-235) divided into teams of five, with 19 special edition Beanz that were made available through various other Mighty Beanz series 2 products, bringing the total up to 235.

* “Series 3” included 110 Beanz (236-409) divided into teams of five, with 64 special edition Beanz that were made available through various other Mighty Beanz series 3 products, bringing the total up to 409. Series 3 was the introduction of Square Beanz. Each 6 pack of series 3 Mighty Beanz had the chance to include a Square Bean instead of a Mega Bean. If a Square Bean was found in a 3 pack it would replace the existing bean on top. There are a known total of 15 Square Beanz with ten of those Beanz being five characters that belong to two different teams. The other five Square Beanz are limited edition that all belong to one team, with each one of the five being limited to 500 Beanz each. In addition to the Square Beanz there are Golden Square Beanz which could only be found in Singapore, if someone were to find one of these they could win up to S$10,000 cash.
* “Series 4” included 110 Beanz (410-549) divided into teams of five, with 30 special edition Beanz that were made available through various other Mighty Beanz series 4 products, bringing the total up to 549. Series 4 was the introduction of Triangle Beanz and Crystal Beanz. Crystal Beanz are regular Beanz with a colored clear plastic casing making the bean see-through. Each 6 pack of series 4 Mighty Beanz had the chance to include a Triangle Bean instead of a Mega Bean. If a Triangle Bean was found in a 3 pack it would replace the existing bean on top. There are a known total of 15 Triangle Beanz with ten of those Beanz being five characters that belong to two different teams. The other five Triangle Beanz are limited edition that all belong to one team. Although not confirmed, it is believed that each one of the five are limited to 500 Beanz each. 

* “Series 5” included 110 Beanz (550-703) divided into teams of five, with 44 special edition Beanz that were made available through various other Mighty Beanz series 5 products, bringing the total up to 703. Series 5 was the introduction of Disc Beanz and Mini Beanz. Mini Beanz are a smaller and shorter version of a regular sized bean. In series 5, Mini Beanz were the replacement for Mega Beanz. Each pack of series 5 Mighty Beanz had the chance to include a Disc Bean. In 6 packs, instead of the Disc Bean replacing an existing bean there would be a slot for the Disc Bean whether there was one included or not. With 3 packs the Disc Bean would replace the existing bean on top as usual. During this time Moose also offered a 15 pack of Mighty Beanz that had the chance to include a Disc Bean. There are a known total of 15 Disc Beanz with ten of those Beanz being five characters that belong to two different teams. The other five Disc Beanz are limited edition that all belong to one team. The limited edition Disc Beanz are a bit different in terms of quantity created, as three of them had 500 of each made, one had 250 made and the last one only had 100 made.

=== 2018 relaunch ===

Moose developed a new line of Mighty Beanz, starting with 140 new Beanz which were released on September 1, 2018. A line of Fortnite-themed Mighty Beanz were produced.
An Easter series and Series 2 of the main line were released in early 2019.
* “Series 1” included 140 Beanz (1-140) divided into teams of five. This time around every single bean is shaped like a Mega Bean instead of a regular sized bean from past series. Series 1 included special Beanz such as Two Faced Beanz, Golden Beanz and limited edition Golden Hero Beanz. Each of the five Golden Hero Beanz were limited to 10,000 a piece, making it much easier to come by compared to past limited edition Beanz.
* “Series 2” included 140 Beanz (141-280) divided into teams of five. Series 2 introduced different finishes that were applied to the Beanz such as Speckled, Frosty, Metallic and Glowin&#x27; Beanz. Golden Beanz make a return along with limited edition Golden Royal Beanz. Each of the five Golden Royal Beanz were once again limited to 10,000 a piece.

<doc id="1111803" wikidata="Q1307068" url="?curid=1111803" title="Chloroacetic acids">
<text>In organic chemistry, the chloroacetic acids (systematic name chloroethanoic acids) are three related chlorocarbon carboxylic acids:

* Chloroacetic acid (chloroethanoic acid), CH2ClCOOH
* Dichloroacetic acid (dichloroethanoic acid; bichloroacetic acid, BCA), CHCl2COOH
* Trichloroacetic acid (trichloroethanoic acid), CCl3COOH

== Properties ==
As the number of chlorine atoms increases, the electronegativity of that end of the molecule increases, and the molecule adopts a progressively more ionic character: its density, boiling point and acidity all increase.

== Production ==

* Chloroacetic acid is mainly made by hydrolysing trichloroethylene in the presence of sulfuric acid:
*: CCl2=CHCl + 2 H2O → CH2ClCOOH + 2 HCl
* Dichloroacetic acid is manufactured in small quantities by reducing trichloroacetic acid.
* Trichloroacetic acid is made by directly reacting chlorine with acetic acid using a suitable catalyst.

== Uses ==

* Chloroacetic acid is chemical intermediate for production of various pharmaceuticals and insecticides.
* Trichloroacetic acid is used for various analytic tests in biochemistry. In sufficient concentration it will cause protein, DNA and RNA to precipitate out of solution.
* The sodium salt of trichloroacetic acid is used as a weedkiller.

== Safety ==

All of these acids are unusually strong for organic acids, and should generally be treated with similar care as for strong mineral acids like hydrochloric acid. Even neutral salts however, tend to be significantly toxic, because the ions interfere in biological processes (such as the citric acid cycle) that normally process plain acetate ions. The chloroacetate anion is the most toxic, with a rat, oral of about 0.5 g/kg.

<text>Trichloroacetic acid (TCA; TCAA; also known as trichloroethanoic acid) is an analogue of acetic acid in which the three hydrogen atoms of the methyl group have all been replaced by chlorine atoms. Salts and esters of trichloroacetic acid are called trichloroacetates.

==Synthesis==
Trichloroacetic acid was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Dumas in 1830.

It is prepared by the reaction of chlorine with acetic acid in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as red phosphorus. This reaction is Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky halogenation.
: + 3  → + 3 
Another route to trichloroacetic acid is the oxidation of trichloroacetaldehyde.

==Use==
It is widely used in biochemistry for the precipitation of macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. TCA and DCA are both used in cosmetic treatments (such as chemical peels and tattoo removal) and as topical medication for chemoablation of warts, including genital warts. It can kill normal cells as well. It is considered safe for use for this purpose during pregnancy.

The sodium salt (sodium trichloroacetate) was used as an herbicide starting in the 1950s but regulators removed it from the market in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Environmental and health concerns==
According to the European Chemicals Agency, &quot;This substance causes severe skin burns and eye damage, is very toxic to aquatic life and has long lasting toxic effects.&quot;

==History==
The discovery of trichloroacetic acid by Jean-Baptiste Dumas in 1839 delivered a striking example to the slowly evolving theory of organic radicals and valences. The theory was contrary to the beliefs of Jöns Jakob Berzelius, starting a long dispute between Dumas and Berzelius.

==Popular culture==
In the 1958 film &quot;The Blob&quot;, a bottle of trichloroacetic acid is tossed at the Blob in a futile attempt to fend it off.

<text>Williamsburg is an unincorporated community in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located in Whitewater Township, Grand Traverse County. The community is home to Turtle Creek Casino and Hotel.

As an unincorporated community, Williamsburg has no legally defined boundaries, population statistics, or administrative powers of its own; however, a post office operates out of the community, with ZIP Code 49690.

== History ==
There is evidence that three different cultures of people have lived in this area since 10,500 BC, especially on Skegemog Point in Lake Skegemog and Elk Lake. Records show that a branch of the Algonquin people, known as the Mascoutin, lived in the area until around 1630s. Later, the area was home to Odawa and Ojibwe peoples.

In 1856, three families from Monroe County, New York, settled the area, and called it Mill Creek. In 1867, the community was given a post office, named Dunbar, after its first postmaster. The post office was renamed to Williamsburgh in 1869, and the &quot;h&quot; was later dropped in 1894.

In 1892, an extension of the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad opened through Williamsburg. In 1982, the rail line, which had previously extended to Charlevoix and Petoskey, was terminated at Williamsburg.

In 1973, 100 to 150 sinkholes opened up around the town caused by natural gas leaks. The sinkholes were caused by increased oil and natural gas drilling operations caused by the 1973 oil crisis. The leaks started when Amoco well E1-22 struck a pocket of natural gas under the village. The gas was then over pressurized, and tore open holes in the surface soil. Residents were evacuated and an exclusion zone was established. Few pictures of the event remain, as fears that the spark of a camera could light the gas in the air, causing the whole town to spontaneously combust. The newly constructed thoroughfare into Traverse City, M-72, was rendered completely unusable after the event. A class action lawsuit was filed by residents that had been displaced for several months during the event. Silt that had become disturbed along creeks and streams in the area had poured in to the Grand Traverse Bay and raised environmental concerns and concerns over the safety of the usually clear water.

== Geography ==
Williamsburg is located in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The community lies about south of Elk Rapids, about east of Traverse City, and about west of Kalkaska. The community is adjacent to a portion of the Grand Traverse Reservation, at which the Turtle Creek Casino and Hotel operates.

=== Major highway ===
* runs east–west directly through the town, providing access to Traverse City and Kalkaska.

== Notable resident ==

* Adam Trautman, National Football League (NFL) tight end, grew up in Williamsburg.

<text>The Ford Model TT is a truck made by Ford. It was based on the Ford Model T, but with a longer wheelbase, and a heavier frame and rear axle, giving it a rating of .

==Production==
When the first three units were produced in 1917, the Model TT was sold as a chassis with the buyer supplying a body. The price was $600. Starting in 1924, the truck was available with a factory-produced body. By 1926 the price had dropped to $325. In 1925, a hand-operated windshield wiper was added.

===Military production===
In his &quot;World Encyclopedia of Military Vehicles&quot;, author Pat Ware writes that: &quot;During World War I, the Model T was ... standardized in the &quot;light&quot; class. The first truck, using a long-wheelbase chassis designated Model TT, was launched in 1917. Although Ford ... was a pacifist, he was ... happy to supply the US Army with more than 12,000 of these vehicles...&quot; and: &quot;There was no civilian production of the Model Ts between 1917 and 1918.&quot;

Further on, Ware writes: &quot;The Model T was widely used by the US and British armies during World War I as a staff car, ambulance, van and cargo truck, even as an artillery tractor, for which application the truck was fitted with twinned rear tyres.&quot; Many remained in service into the 1930s.

Below are the numbers of Model T trucks produced each year, not including Canadian production.

==Drivetrain==
The rear axle of the TT has a worm drive and crown wheel, unlike the Model T&#x27;s crown wheel and pinion. The worm is located at the end of the drive shaft and above the crown wheel. The wheelbase of the Model TT is , compared to for the Model T. It was often equipped with an accessory gearbox, such as the Ruckstell or Jumbo gearboxes, which allow the truck to have intermediate gears between low and high, useful for hill climbing.

The Model TT was very durable for the time, but slow when compared to other trucks. With standard gearing, a speed of not more than was recommended, and with special gearing, a speed of not more than was recommended. Standard worm gear ratio is 7.25:1, and special gearing gives a ratio of 5.17:1. Because of this, accessory catalogs offered items to help give the Model TT more power.

It was replaced by the Ford Model AA truck in 1928.

<text>Andrea Pazienza (; 23 May 1956 – 16 June 1988) was an Italian comics artist and painter.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Pazienza was born in San Benedetto del Tronto, province of Ascoli Piceno, in 1956.
Growing up in his father&#x27;s town of San Severo in Apulia, he enrolled in 1974 at the Department of Arts, Music, and Entertainment of the University of Bologna.

===Career===
He made his debut in the spring of 1977 in the magazine &quot;Alteralter&quot; with his first comic story, &quot;Le straordinarie avventure di Pentothal&quot; (Pentothal&#x27;s extraordinary adventures), the surrealistic and psychedelic story of an alter ego named after the sedative Penthothal. He later participated in such editorial experiences as &quot;Cannibale&quot;, &quot;Il Male&quot;, and &quot;Frigidaire&quot;, of which he was one of the founders. In these publications, he created hundreds of comics, influenced by American underground comics and Walt Disney. He was especially fond of the character Goofy, which he appropriated for a humorous spoof on Italian hippiedom of the 1970s entitled &quot;Perché Pippo sembra uno sballato&quot; (&quot;Why Goofy Looks Like a Pothead&quot;), and a later, unfinished story entitled &quot;La leggenda di Italianino Liberatore&quot; (&quot;The Legend of Italianino Liberatore&quot;, referring to his old friend Tanino Liberatore).

Pazienza developed a personal body of work, alternating between playful comic cartooning—at times politically charged–and much more elaborate, dark, disturbing graphic novels, often dealing with drugs and wanton violence, with a scattering of black humor throughout.

In 1980, he created the character Zanardi and collaborated with the magazines &quot;Corto Maltese&quot; and &quot;Comic Art&quot;, while also producing movie and theatre posters, scene designs, record covers, and advertising. He was extremely prolific through the 1980s, penning hundreds of single-panel cartoons as well as longer, intricate stories usually centred on Zanardi. &quot;Pompeo&quot;, his last graphic novel, which depicts the gradual downfall of a heroin addict (a largely autobiographical character) up to his eventual suicide, is generally considered his masterwork; the post-face to this work testifies that Pazienza tried to start a new life and, for a while, quit drugs.

===Death and legacy===
Andrea Pazienza died at age 32 in Montepulciano, from a heroin overdose.

The nonprofit association &quot;Centro Fumetto Andrea Pazienza&quot; was created in his honour to help young cartoonists develop their skills.

In 2011, Andrea Pazienza was picked as the first of &quot;150 Italians&quot;, a list of the country&#x27;s most influential people, which was dedicated to the 150th anniversary of Italian unification.

<doc id="1111814" wikidata="Q1581759" url="?curid=1111814" title="1983 World Series">
<text>The 1983 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1983 season. The 80th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League champion Baltimore Orioles and the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Orioles won, four games to one to win their third title. &quot;The I-95 Series&quot;, like the World Series two years later, also took its nickname from the interstate that the teams and fans traveled on, Interstate 95 in this case. This was the last World Series that Bowie Kuhn presided over as commissioner.

This is Baltimore&#x27;s most recent World Series championship, and also their most recent appearance in a World Series.

This was the first World Series since 1956 in which the teams did not use air travel, as Baltimore and Philadelphia are approximately apart.

It was the Phillies’ second World Series appearance in four years. It would be 10 years before they would appear in the Fall Classic again and 25 years before they would win another.

This was the first World Series in which no umpire worked behind home plate using the outside chest protector, which had been mandatory in the American League from the 1920s through 1974. The AL required all new umpires to use the inside protector, near-universal in the National League since Bill Klem invented it in the 1910s, starting in 1977, but umpires using the outside protector could continue to use it if they wished. World Series crew chief Marty Springstead used the outside protector from the beginning of his career in 1965 until switching to the inside protector prior to the 1983 regular season.

==Preview==
===Baltimore Orioles===
The Orioles were led by first-year manager Joe Altobelli, who succeeded Earl Weaver; Weaver retired to the broadcast booth after a 16-year managerial run from 1968 to 1982. Altobelli inherited a lineup led by first baseman Eddie Murray (.306 BA, 33 HR, 111 RBI), who finished second in the 1983 MVP voting, and shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. (.318 BA, 27 HR, 102 RBI), who out-pointed Murray, 322–290, and won the 1983 MVP. Veteran outfielder Ken Singleton settled into the DH role, while the rest of the team was a corps of platoon players. The Orioles finished first in the AL in team home runs (168); first in OBP (.340); and second in runs, doubles, and walks.

After winning 15 games in 1982, 37-year-old pitcher Jim Palmer started only 11 games in 1983, winning five and losing four. He won one game in this World Series and would be released by the O&#x27;s at the beginning of 1984 after struggling early, retiring shortly afterwards. A younger staff headed by 18-game winner Scott McGregor (18–7, 3.18 ERA) and 25-year-old Mike Boddicker (16–8, 2.77) were flanked by 21-year-old Storm Davis (13–7, 3.59) and veteran Mike Flanagan (12–4, 3.30). Reliever Tippy Martinez posted a career high with 21 saves, while Sammy Stewart added nine wins out of the bullpen as the O&#x27;s pitching led the AL in shutouts (15) and was second in wins (98) and ERA (3.63).

The Orioles won the American League East by six games over the Detroit Tigers. They then defeated the Chicago White Sox, three games to one, in the American League Championship Series.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
The average age of the players on the Phillies&#x27; roster was 32 years. They were aptly nicknamed the &quot;Wheeze Kids,&quot; a contrast to the 1950 Phillies team whose average age of 26 years earned them the moniker &quot;Whiz Kids.&quot; Sports writers in Philadelphia joked at the time that this older team emphasized the &quot;veteran&quot; in their home ballpark, Veterans Stadium. The Phillies were trying to win Philadelphia its second World Title of the year as the Philadelphia 76ers had won the NBA Title back in June, as well as their second championship in four seasons — having won the 1980 World Series.

Joining 42-year-old first baseman Pete Rose were his Cincinnati Reds teammates from the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; era, first baseman Tony Pérez (age 41) and second baseman Joe Morgan (age 39). The team was led offensively by 33-year-old Mike Schmidt, who would have another MVP-type year with 40 home runs and 109 RBIs. No other teammate would hit over 16 home runs (Morgan) or drive in over 64 runs (catcher Bo Díaz).

Although veteran pitcher Steve Carlton won his 300th major league game during the regular season, he actually had a mediocre year at 15–16 — his first losing season since 1973 when his record was 13–20. In his first full season with Philadelphia, John Denny would win the Cy Young Award with a league leading 19–6 record, and a 2.37 ERA, winning 13 of his last 14 decisions. Closer Al Holland would finish second in the league with 25 saves and win the NL Rolaids Relief Award. A pair of relief pitchers, 40-year-old Ron Reed and 38-year-old Tug McGraw, were on the active roster but McGraw would not see any World Series action.

The Phillies outpaced their intrastate rivals, the Pittsburgh Pirates, by six games to win their fifth National League East division title in eight years. This was followed by a three-games-to-one victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series. It was only the fourth league championship for the Phillies in franchise history.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
John Denver, whose &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Country Boy&quot; was played at the seventh-inning stretch of each Orioles home game, sang the National Anthem.

Phillies starter John Denny gave up a first-inning homer to Jim Dwyer, but that would be it for the Orioles as 40-year-old Joe Morgan tied it with a home run in the sixth off Scott McGregor. Morgan became the second-oldest man to hit a home run in the World Series (Enos Slaughter was just a few months older than Morgan when he hit one for the New York Yankees in the 1956 World Series). Garry Maddox led off the eighth with a home run off McGregor for the final margin. Denny got the win with relief help from ace Al Holland.

The Orioles&#x27; loss in Game 1 marked the first time in six World Series that they had lost the first game.

===Game 2===
Boddicker went the distance, striking out six and walking no one. He allowed only three hits and one run, a fourth-inning sacrifice fly by Joe Lefebvre. The O&#x27;s got their runs in the fifth on a John Lowenstein homer, a Rick Dempsey RBI double, and a sacrifice fly by Boddicker, helping his own cause. Cal Ripken added an RBI single in the seventh.

When the Phillies benched Pete Rose in favor of Tony Pérez in Game 3, it ended a streak in which Rose played every inning of his 59 previous postseason games. This would be the final postseason game ever played at Memorial Stadium.

===Game 3===
Steve Carlton became the first 300-game winner to pitch in a World Series in 55 years (Grover Cleveland Alexander was the last). Carlton shut out the Orioles through five innings, buoyed by homers from Gary Matthews and Joe Morgan. The Orioles cut the lead to one in the sixth on a homer by Dan Ford.

In the bottom of the sixth, the Phillies had two on and two outs with Carlton coming up to bat. Phillie manager Paul Owens went to the on-deck circle to chat with Carlton about staying in the game. Carlton said he was fine, but struck out for the final out.

Carlton looked to be cruising with two outs in the seventh, but Rick Dempsey belted a double and went to third on a wild pitch. Benny Ayala pinch-hit and singled home Dempsey to tie it. Al Holland relieved Carlton to try to close out the inning, but John Shelby singled Ayala to put runners at first and second. Ayala scored the go-ahead run from second on an error by shortstop Iván DeJesús on a ball hit by Ford.

Long-time Oriole pitching hero Jim Palmer got the win in relief as he, Sammy Stewart, and Tippy Martinez pitched five shutout innings in relief of Mike Flanagan. This win by Palmer, along with his first World Series win in 1966, marks the longest span (17 years) over World Series wins for an individual pitcher in major league history. Jim Palmer&#x27;s win in Game 3 made him the only pitcher to win a World Series game in three different decades. Palmer is also, the only man to have played with the Orioles in each of their World Series appearances (, , , , , and 1983). With Palmer and Carlton earning the decisions, this was the last World Series game in which both the winning and losing pitcher were later inducted into the Hall of Fame until 1992.

It was the first World Series game in which three Cy Young Award winners, Carlton, Palmer and Orioles&#x27; starter Mike Flanagan, pitched. This would not happen again until Game 1 of the 2012 Series, when Barry Zito, Tim Lincecum and Justin Verlander appeared.

This also was the first career World Series game for Pete Rose in which he wasn&#x27;t in the starting lineup (after 31 career World Series games). Rose did make a pinch-hit appearance, grounding out in the ninth inning.

===Game 4===
Rich Dauer broke a scoreless tie by singling in two runs in the fourth off John Denny. The Phillies came back in the fourth off Storm Davis with an RBI double by Joe Lefebvre and took the lead in the fifth on an RBI single by Denny and an RBI double by Pete Rose.

In the top of the sixth with one out, John Lowenstein singled and Dauer doubled him to third. O&#x27;s manager Joe Altobelli then sent Joe Nolan, the first of four consecutive pinch-hitters, to the plate. Denny intentionally walked Nolan to load the bases. The next pinch-hitter, Ken Singleton, walked as well to force in Lowenstein with the tying run. John Denny was removed in favor of Willie Hernandez. John Shelby, hitting for Storm Davis, hit a deep sacrifice fly to Gary Matthews who made a remarkable catch to keep the O&#x27;s ahead 4–3.

The Orioles added an insurance run in the seventh on an RBI single by Dauer, who would collect three hits and three RBIs. The Phillies would get no closer than a single run in the ninth, as Tippy Martinez got his second save of the series.

The crowd of 66,947 in Veterans Stadium was the biggest for the World Series since Game 3 in New York in 1964.

This is the last World Series game with a scheduled daytime start played under sunny skies. Game 4 of the 1984 World Series was played under overcast skies at Tiger Stadium, and game 6 of the 1987 World Series (last World Series game with a daytime start) was played indoors at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.

===Game 5===
Throughout this series, both teams&#x27; big gun hitters had been held in check. Mike Schmidt was 1 for 16, while Eddie Murray was 2 for 16. In this game, however, Murray snapped out of it by belting two home runs and driving in three runs. Rick Dempsey, who would be named MVP, also homered and doubled and scored two runs. Scott McGregor pitched a complete game, five-hit shutout to give the Orioles the championship. Cal Ripken Jr. made the final putout of the series, snaring a liner by Garry Maddox.

The Phillies finished this Series with a team batting average of .195, with no one having a worse Series than Schmidt, going a paltry 1 for 20 (.050 batting average) and overall the lowest average for a World Series team since the 1974 Oakland Athletics. The winning Orioles hit only .213 in the series.

The Philadelphia Eagles were originally scheduled to play the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday, October 16, at Veterans Stadium. Because of the scheduling conflict, the Eagles and the Cowboys, who were scheduled for two games against each other because they were in the same division, played on that day on the Cowboys&#x27; field, Texas Stadium. (Their other game had been scheduled for November 6 at Texas Stadium, and that game was played at Veterans Stadium.)

1983 World Series (4–1): Baltimore Orioles (A.L.) over Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.)
==Aftermath==
Pitcher Larry Andersen was the only person to play for the Phillies in the 1983 World Series and the 1993 World Series against Toronto. Also, this series proved to be Cal Ripken&#x27;s only World Series appearance even though the Orioles shortstop would become baseball&#x27;s iron-man as he would surpass Lou Gehrig by playing in his 2,131st consecutive game on September 6, 1995. Ripken would also make it back to the postseason in both the 1996 and 1997 seasons only reaching the ALCS each time. Teammate Eddie Murray would reach the World Series again but the 1995 Cleveland Indians would lose in six games. Storm Davis, John Shelby, and series MVP Rick Dempsey would reach the 1988 World Series, Davis with the Oakland Athletics and Shelby and Dempsey with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Baltimore became the first visiting team to win Games 3, 4 and 5 since , when the New York Yankees did so vs. the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field. This has occurred three times since 1983. The first was , when the Yankees again did it, this time against the Atlanta Braves in the final three games played at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium; the next was , when the Houston Astros did it against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park, although the Astros became the first team to lose a World Series after winning games 3, 4 and 5 on the road, dropping games 6 and 7 at Minute Maid Park (making it the first it the first time in the history of &quot;any &quot; of the Big 4 leagues that the visiting team won every game of a 7-game series); and in , when the Texas Rangers did it against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field. By comparison, the home team has swept Games 3-5 12 times since .

This would be the final World Series with color commentator Howard Cosell. Two years later, Cosell was scheduled to be in the booth but he was removed at the last minute due to the controversy surrounding his book &quot;I Never Played the Game&quot; and was replaced with Tim McCarver.

It was initially released on October 25, 1971 by Columbia Records as a four-LP vinyl box set, and was also available for a time as two separate two-record sets. A quadraphonic mix of the album was proposed, but was never made, possibly due to the band&#x27;s objection to the album being released in the first place. This is the only Chicago album of the group&#x27;s first ten releases not to have a quadraphonic release in any format.

The album reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) two weeks after its release, and was certified platinum in 1986.

==Background==
While touring in support of &quot;Chicago III&quot;, Chicago played Carnegie Hall for a week in April 1971 and recorded all of their shows. A four-LP box set for release as Chicago&#x27;s fourth album (that distinction being responsible for the album&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Chicago IV&quot;) was the result. Walter Parazaider told writer William James Ruhlmann that &quot;The reason behind the live record for Carnegie Hall is, we were the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll group to sell out a week at Carnegie Hall, and that was worth rolling up the trucks for, putting the mikes up there, and really chronicling what happened in 1971.&quot;

Columbia were very skeptical on the risk the extended set posed, and with a decrease in royalties to counter that fear (a similar situation befell their 1969 debut, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;), Chicago released &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot; that October to a mixed reaction. While the set sold very well, reaching No. 3 in the US (but failing to chart in the UK), the critics found the album too long—and even indulgent with its inclusions of tune-ups.

The band themselves have remained divided through the years over the merits of the album. Robert Lamm and Walter Parazaider defended the album to William James Ruhlmann, while James Pankow and Peter Cetera were not happy with the result. Pankow told Ruhlmann, &quot;I hate it. ... The acoustics of Carnegie Hall were never meant for amplified music, ...the brass after being miked came out sounding like kazoos.&quot; Lee Loughnane said that although he thinks the album is good, there were many things he didn&#x27;t like about it and that he didn&#x27;t think the album should have been released.

In recognition of setting Carnegie Hall records and the ensuing four LP live recordings, the group was awarded a &quot;Billboard&quot; 1972 Trendsetter Award. Despite poor sound quality, &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot;, according to William James Ruhlmann, went on to become &quot;perhaps&quot; the best-selling box set by a rock act until the release of the &quot;Live/1975-85&quot; five-LP live box set by Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band in 1986. It is still the best-selling four-LP set.

In 2005, &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot; was remastered and re-issued on three CDs by Rhino Records with improved sound quality, a bonus disc of eight tracks of alternate takes and songs not on the 1971 edition, and recreations of nearly all the original posters and packaging.

On Monday April 5th, 2021, 50 years to the day of their first Carnegie Hall show, Rhino Records announced a 50th Anniversary 16-CD box set called &quot;Chicago Live At Carnegie Hall Complete&quot;. The collection includes all six shows in their entirety which were performed from April 5 through April 10, 1971, plus two matinee performances. The set was produced by engineer Tim Jessup along with band member Lee Loughnane, and was released on September 10, 2021.

==Artwork and packaging==
The original LP release of this set contained two giant posters of the band, a poster of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s exterior, an insert about voting information, and a 20-page softcover booklet; this last contained photos of the band members playing during the concert, and on the back bore a full touring schedule from their first tour through their 1971 US tour. The band&#x27;s official web site labels the cover design &quot;white tile&quot;.

==Reception==
Lester Bangs, writing for &quot;Creem&quot; in February 1972, considered the musicianship on &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot; &quot;technically competent&quot; but &quot;there are just too many times when you can hear all the parts better than the whole.&quot; He also considered the arrangements &quot;sodden&quot; carbon copies of the studio versions augmented with &quot;directionless solos,&quot; and called the album the band&#x27;s worst.

In a retrospective review, Lindsay Planer of Allmusic praised the &quot;muscular&quot; performances of several songs, but considered the reeds and the brass thin-sounding, and Carnegie Hall to be acoustically poor for amplified rock.

<doc id="1111824" wikidata="Q1151640" url="?curid=1111824" title="Mansun">
<text>Mansun were an English alternative rock band, formed in Chester in 1995. The band comprised vocalist/rhythm guitarist Paul Draper, bassist Stove King, lead guitarist/backing vocalist Dominic Chad, and drummer Andie Rathbone.

It was announced in May 2003 that the band had split up earlier that year, whilst in the process of recording their fourth album, and some of their archival recording of the album later released on their final album, &quot;Kleptomania&quot; (2004).

==History==

===Formation===
Paul Draper and Stove King met in the early 1990s, whilst working in the printing industry as photo retouchers for rival companies situated opposite each other on the same industrial park in Little Stanney on the outskirts of Chester. Through their shared love of David Bowie and 1980s new wave bands including Duran Duran and ABC they started socialising together at weekends, going to gigs in Liverpool and playing along to drum loops together in their bedrooms with the desire of forming a band together. Whilst King was a relative newcomer to playing bass, Draper had previously formed and fronted the electronic duo Grind whilst studying at Thames Polytechnic (now University of Greenwich), with programmer-keyboard player Steve Heaton, and were often accompanied live by school friend Carlton Hibbert on drums. 

Grind released one 12&quot; single in 1991 on the small &quot;Whats in It For Me Records&quot; label and gigged around London at venues such as The Rock Garden and The Brain and also supported Beverley Craven at the Mean Fiddler. Following the split of Grind, Draper, funded by a grant from The Prince&#x27;s Trust, set up a music company called &quot;Ambiance Productions&quot; producing relaxation tapes to be sold in &quot;hippie shops&quot; across the north west of England. In early 1995 Draper and King enlisted Maidstone expat Dominic Chad, who was the bar manager at the Fat Cat pub on Watergate Street in Chester opposite the office where Draper would go and see former Grind member Steve Heaton. Chad had previously played with &quot;Floating Bear&quot; formed whilst at Bangor University in 1990, where he had been studying French and Russian but was kicked off the course due to lack of effort. Chad would later admit that his routine during university was &quot;get up at three, go down to the union bar at four and stay there until it shut&quot;. 

With the aid of a drum machine, the trio began rehearsing at Crash Rehearsal Studios in Liverpool, where the band were quickly discovered by passing A&amp;R scouts Mark Lewis and Alan Wills (who later went on to form Deltasonic Records) who were there to see Cast and overheard the band through their rehearsal room door. The band were offered a publishing contract with Polygram Music Publishing four days after reluctantly handing over a demo tape of 4 songs that cost £150 to record featuring &quot;Take It Easy Chicken&quot;, &quot;Skin Up Pin Up&quot;, &quot;Moronica&quot; and &quot;She Makes My Nose Bleed&quot;.

===Early days (1995–96)===
The band were initially called Grey Lantern, after Draper&#x27;s DC Comics influenced alter ego which he created to help overcome his nervousness on stage, but soon changed their name to &quot;Manson&quot;, after the cult leader Charles Manson. The band&#x27;s self-financed debut release &quot;Take It Easy Chicken&quot; in September 1995 on their own &quot;Sci-Fi Hi-Fi Recordings&quot; label soon attracted the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq and John Peel and the band found themselves, despite not having played a single gig and later admitting that they couldn&#x27;t play together as a band very well at the time, at the centre of a record label bidding war. This resulted in the band signing to Parlophone, with whom they released the follow-up single &quot;Skin Up Pin Up / Flourella&quot; in November 1995 on sublabel Regal Recordings, although this time under the new moniker &quot;Mansun&quot; as they were forced to change the spelling due to threatened legal action from the Charles Manson Estate. The band gave several false accounts of this at the time, one being that they were named after The Verve B-side &quot;A Man Called Sun&quot;, and that &quot;Manson&quot; was simply a spelling mistake which accidentally went through to production. It was later reported that Charles Manson had started spelling his name with a &quot;u&quot;, to which Draper joked that they should sue him in return.

Following the release of &quot;Skin Up Pin Up / Flourella&quot;, the band were moved up to the main Parlophone label and released several EPs, including an expanded re-release of the debut single. The first lineup of the band alongside Draper, King and Chad had featured former Grind drummer Carlton Hibbert and drum machine programmer Mark Swinnerton. Following five months of touring, starting with the band&#x27;s first gig in August 1995 at The Lomax in Liverpool and support gigs with Heavy Stereo and The Charlatans, Swinnerton left the band in January 1996. As a four piece, the band continued touring including support gigs with Cast, Audioweb and Shed Seven until Hibbert was sacked from the band in May 1996 following a series of rows with an inebriated Chad that resulted in a bizarre incident that involved a pineapple being thrown at Chad&#x27;s face in Cambridge, where the band were supporting Shed Seven. Throughout the early days of the band, Chad was involved in a string of violent alcohol fuelled incidents. These included punching his own reflection in a hotel mirror, being thrown out of a pub after attempting to drop kick the bar, throwing pint glasses out of a window in Sheffield, getting himself banned along with the rest of the band from every outlet of the now defunct roadside restaurant chain Happy Eater, all Hard Rock Cafes worldwide and every Holiday Inn hotel in the UK after drop kicking a statue of the Venus de Milo. Ex-Kinky Machine drummer Julian Fenton was temporarily drafted in for gigs and featured in the promo videos for &quot;Take It Easy Chicken&quot; and &quot;Stripper Vicar&quot;.

In August 1996 Andie Rathbone joined, a well known drummer in Chester who had been playing regularly with several bands including DNA Cowboys, The Wandering Quatrains and Jonti. Having auditioned several drummers without success, the band took a break at a local pub where &quot;there was the best rock drummer we&#x27;d ever seen, playing with this really dodgy band&quot;, but the drummer, who was also working as an Audi car salesman at the time, initially rejected the bands pleas to join the band, as he thought the band played &quot;Britpop shite&quot;. He changed his mind after King played him a demo of one of the band&#x27;s latest songs, &quot;Wide Open Space&quot;. Rathbone&#x27;s first gig with the band was performing &quot;Stripper Vicar&quot; live on &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, having missed the previous nights gig in Brighton due to getting a train to Bristol Temple Meads by mistake and having to check the gig guide in the &quot;NME&quot; to find out where the gig was.

===&quot;Attack of the Grey Lantern&quot; (1997)===
February 1997 saw the release of the band&#x27;s critically acclaimed debut album &quot;Attack of the Grey Lantern&quot;. Although the band had finished recording most of the album prior to Rathbone joining, they went back into the studio to record new songs &quot;Taxloss&quot; and &quot;Mansun&#x27;s Only Love Song&quot; and re-record several drum tracks. The album appeared to contain a conceptual storyline, which Draper referred to as &quot;small town weirdo observations&quot; and was influenced by comedies &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and &quot;Monty Python&quot;, whilst ending with a hidden track, &quot;An Open Letter to the Lyrical Trainspotter&quot;, proclaiming (reportedly sarcastically) that &quot;the lyrics aren&#x27;t supposed to mean that much&quot;. The album knocked labelmates Blur&#x27;s self-titled album from the top spot of the UK album chart after only being released the week before.

During the early days of the band, Mansun were noted and sometimes derided for their constantly changing fashion styles. Such styles ranged from punk, new romantic, baggy &quot;Madchester&quot; clothes, army fatigues, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; style boiler suits and even women&#x27;s clothing. Draper admitted that it was &quot;probably overenthusiasm, seeing people like Bowie&#x27;s different guises and thinking, &#x27;Great! Let&#x27;s try that.&#x27;&quot;

===&quot;Six&quot; (1998–99)===
Following the release of the standalone &quot;Closed for Business&quot; EP in October 1997, the band found themselves short of songs going into the studio sessions at Olympic Studios for second album &quot;Six&quot;. Suffering from writer&#x27;s block, Draper took inspiration from books Chad had taken out with him on tour, such as &quot;120 Days of Sodom&quot; by Marquis de Sade, &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; by A. A. Milne, and &quot;&quot; by L. Ron Hubbard, by quickly scanning them to get the gist of the books and then forming lyrics based on them. Many of the musical ideas were assembled during soundchecks on the previous US tour. Chad admitted that the band &quot;had all these ideas that we came up with on tour, but we didn&#x27;t have any complete songs. For the album, we simply recorded all the musical snippets, and then figured out key and tempo changes that would link the sections together&quot;. With the lack of complete songs going into the album sessions, Draper set out to put together enough material at the weekends in the band&#x27;s rented accommodation in Barnes so that there was enough material each week for the band to work on. 

Through constant touring, the band were now confident to record as a band in the studio and set out to replicate their live sound and make the album heavier and more guitar based in contrast to the more commercial sounding drum loop and synthesiser based sound of the debut. On the Chad penned &quot;Witness to Murder Part II&quot;, the band enlisted former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Tom Baker to perform the monologue, with King admitting that &quot;the whole band are big fans of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and Tom Baker, so we thought he&#x27;d be ideal. Tom heard the track and immediately agreed to perform on it&quot;. The track was intended as an interlude between two sides of the album, as if it was a vinyl record, but Chad later stated he regretted putting it on the album. The original idea was to package the CD version of the album in a 12&quot; gatefold sleeve to replicate the vinyl experience, but was abandoned due to possible issues with getting it stocked by retailers.

The album was preceded by the singles &quot;Legacy&quot;, which provided the band with the highest-charting single, and &quot;Being a Girl&quot;. Several more singles followed the release of the album, including &quot;Negative&quot; and a re-recording of the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Six&quot; produced by Arthur Baker. Draper later admitted to placing the two main singles at the end of the album to be awkward, and tried to avoid having choruses on the album, leaving many of those tracks to be released as b-sides, which he thought would have made a better rock album. He described the album as being &quot;commercial suicide&quot;.

===&quot;Little Kix&quot; (2000)===
Mansun&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Little Kix&quot; (early working titles included Magnetic Poetry and The Trouble With Relationships,) saw Draper and Chad decamp to the south of Spain in March 1999 where they wrote and demo&#x27;d ideas for the album. Draper claimed that following the commercial and critical disappointment of &quot;Six&quot;, he didn&#x27;t feel any pressure to follow it up and therefore set out to go in a different direction with the new album. Prior to the writing trip in Spain, he had decided that the new album would be more &quot;acoustic-guitary&quot; and wanted to prove to himself that he could still write pop songs with choruses. The album was recorded at &quot;Astoria&quot;, a houseboat-studio owned by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, with former XTC and Police producer Hugh Padgham,

Despite initially admitting that the album was &quot;all about &#x27;What do you want out of your life, what do you want out of a relationship?&#x27; And I didn&#x27;t want to make another disillusioned, really dark record&quot;, and that &quot;anyone who gets &quot;Little Kix&quot; knows it&#x27;s a good album&quot; Draper refused to tour or promote the album. &quot;I Can Only Disappoint U&quot; gave the band their biggest selling single to date and second highest charting single after &quot;Legacy&quot;, but Draper&#x27;s refusal to promote the album led to the album stalling at #14 in the charts. He later admitted that whilst they were trying to make a &quot;timeless record&quot;, he &quot;just don&#x27;t think we realised the record we were making until towards the end&quot; and Chad also later stated that the album &quot;just didn&#x27;t sound like us because there was lots of keyboards&quot;.

Several years following the split of the band, Draper claimed that he was demoted as the band&#x27;s producer as the rest of the band were no longer comfortable with him producing and the label reportedly wanted to ensure the band didn&#x27;t go off on another tangent as with &quot;Six&quot;, and was forced to work with an outside producer for the first time, stating that &quot;the management wanted a soft rock album made behind my back for some reason and I got manipulated into releasing it&quot; and that the band were &quot;steamrollered into doing a commercial sounding 3rd album&quot;.

===Aborted fourth album and split (2001–2003)===
In January 2001, prior to the final single &quot;Fool&quot; being released off &quot;Little Kix&quot;, Draper informed the &quot;NME&quot; that the band were set to enter the studio in March or April of that year and that the band wanted to release new material as soon as possible. In April, Draper told fans through the official website that the band had recorded and mixed eight new songs and would continue recording in May. The band were considering their options as to whether to release an EP or to hold the material back for a full album. In August, Chad posted on the band&#x27;s official website to inform fans that the band had abandoned plans for an EP and were now halfway through recording their fourth album, which would be &quot;harder&quot; than &quot;Little Kix&quot; and that they planned to release a single in December. The band&#x27;s aim for the record was to make it as representative of Mansun as a live band as possible, that it sounded &quot;like a live band playing in a room&quot; but also that it had all the &quot;creative sounds that &quot;Six&quot; had&quot;. In October 2001 the Mansun ansaphone service operated by King since the early days of the band went down. In March 2002 and with no sign of new material, it was claimed that the delay in the new album being finished was due to Chad&#x27;s injuring his hand after falling into a fire grate, keeping him from playing for four to five months, but confirmed that the band had so far finished 15 songs.

Draper later revealed that he had been diagnosed with cancer during recording sessions at Rockfield Studios, after a blister appeared on his left hand middle finger that kept bleeding. He visited a local doctor who took a sample of tissue from the finger. It was confirmed that it was malignant and was known as a &quot;Bowenoid malignancy,&quot; and Draper responded positively to five cycles of chemotherapy. However, he was unable to play for several months after his finger swelled up following treatment

In April and May 2002 the band embarked on a low-key UK tour, which was initially planned to be secret and promoted under the pseudonym The Masons. The band played short ten song sets on the tour, one half old songs and the other half new songs set to appear on their forthcoming album. One website prophetically reported that the tour would be the band&#x27;s last, although this was denied at the time.

In the following October, Chad revealed that a planned studio session for that month had been abandoned as they had wanted to continue writing. Following extended delays in the band delivering the new album to Parlophone, rumour spread in December 2002 that the band had been given an ultimatum that if they didn&#x27;t complete the album by early in the new year, they would be dropped. In January 2003, a posting on the band&#x27;s official Yahoo list claimed that a member of the band had left &quot;amid massive animosity&quot;, later elaborating that &quot;a member of the band had quit, did not want to rejoin and the remaining members did not want him back&quot; and that as a result of this, the band had split up.

Following months of speculation, the band&#x27;s split was officially announced on 2 May 2003, with the press release stating that the band decided to call it a day after realising that &quot;the life of the group had come to an end&quot;. Chad commented on the split, that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing sinister behind it, it was completely amicable. We all just want to be able to do other things&quot;. It was later revealed that the announcement had been delayed as Draper had unexpectedly fled to the US with no fixed date of return and that it was Stove King&#x27;s departure from the band that had resulted in the band splitting.

Despite Chad having proclaimed the new material to be their best work yet, incorporating elements of all the band&#x27;s previous albums and praising Draper&#x27;s writing as being better than ever, Draper later claimed that when working on the new album, none of the band&#x27;s hearts were in it and in 2008 went on to blame Chad for the split, stating that the guitarist &quot;wasn’t happy with the working method of writing and recording, but didn’t want to implement his own writing and recording method so we simply had to go home and end the band&quot;. Rathbone described the album as being &quot;the first album that captured an essence of the live sound&quot;, but also that the sessions were frustrating and revealed that towards the end, the band had split into two camps - himself and King who still resided in Chester, and Draper and Chad who had moved to Weybridge, Surrey.

In September 2015, Draper went on to further claim that Chad tried to sack him from the band several times following the release of &quot;Little Kix&quot;. He stated that Chad &quot;didn’t want me to be the producer or the songwriter and he wanted me replaced by another singer and for the band to be more like The Seahorses, remember that band with John Squire? He wanted the songs to come out of jams in rehearsal rooms&quot;. Further commenting on the band&#x27;s split, Draper claimed that &quot;one or two members did way too many drugs and a lot of people interfering, it wasn’t handled properly and it ended in disaster&quot;.

In March 2023, Dominic Chad announced via social media that &quot;since late 2006 I have tried to have no contact with Paul Draper and he has failed to respect that on numerous occasions. I must state publicly that it is my choice to have nothing to do with him; he is not welcome to engage with me, my family or friends or continue to try contacting me through my place of work&quot;. He also revealed that he had requested that Kscope, the label that currently owns the rights to the Mansun catalogue, remove his image and name from any and all future Mansun releases and that the label had confirmed they will do their best to comply with his request.

===&quot;Kleptomania&quot; and other releases (2004–present)===
With news of the split being confirmed and with the knowledge that most of the fourth album, which was set to be self titled, had already been recorded, an online petition was set up by fans to persuade Parlophone to release the material. The tracks intended for the album were then released in September 2004, along with the non-album singles and a selection of B-sides (compiled by Draper from a top 20 voted for by fans on the band&#x27;s official website) and rarities in a 3 CD box set entitled &quot;Kleptomania&quot;. Draper later claimed that after Parlophone contacted him to ask whether he wanted to be involved in putting together the album sessions for release, he tried to reform the band to properly finish it but no one else was interested.

&quot;&quot; was released in September 2006, with a limited edition CD/DVD release also issued containing promo videos for every single plus a documentary and other bonus material. The CD also provided access to download the previously unreleased &quot;South of the Painted Hall&quot;, which was originally set for release on &quot;Kleptomania&quot;, but the multitrack was incomplete, missing the lead vocal. The free download version is sourced from a reference CD-R which featured a rough mix with a guide vocal.

In March 2008, on the prospect of a Mansun reunion, Draper stated that whilst he and Andie Rathbone were interested, &quot;Dominic Chad would never do it, so it can&#x27;t happen&quot;. In 2010, Rathbone commented that it was a &quot;pity the three others couldn&#x27;t stop dramatising the problems and get out again, as we&#x27;d be phenomenal&quot;. In 2011 Rathbone again confirmed his and Draper&#x27;s desire to reform the band, but added that a reunion would have to include all four band members and that neither King nor Chad were interested.

An article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 24 December 2011, entitled &quot;The Guide&#x27;s guide to the next 12 months&quot;, claimed that the band were set to reunite in 2012 with a new album planned, but was later denied by official sources and confirmed to be a mistake by the article&#x27;s author.

===Solo activity===
Following the split, Draper worked with ex-Skunk Anansie singer Skin on songs for her Gordon Raphael produced album &quot;Fake Chemical State&quot;, and recorded demos for artists such as Komakino and Catherine A.D. In 2009 he worked with The Joy Formidable on their free download-only single &quot;Greyhounds in the Slips&quot;. In 2007 Draper began working with singer-songwriter Catherine A.D, he has produced and co-written songs on her debut album which was due for release under the name The Anchoress in 2014.

In 2013, Draper said that he was working on solo material since the band split and was not opposed to releasing the songs he has recorded as a solo artist if people are interested in hearing them. In light of this, a petition was set up on Facebook where fans could show support by &#x27;liking&#x27; the page. Draper responded to the petition and spoke of how he and DJ Marc Riley were literally overwhelmed with emails of support and questions about his unreleased project, following an appearance on BBC Radio 6 Music in October. He stated in November 2013 that he was giving the matter of releasing solo material some &quot;very serious consideration&quot;. In 2016, Draper released his first solo single, and his debut full album release, &quot;Spooky Action&quot;, was released in August 2017.

Rathbone formed the short-lived Seraphim with Jonti Thackray with whom he was in a band with prior to joining Mansun and has continued working with bands including The Jokers, Amsterdam, Blondie tribute band &quot;Into The Bleach&quot; and Chester supergroup World Upside Down. Rathbone also set up a mobile drum teaching service.

Neither Chad nor King have been involved in the music industry since the split. In the press release for &quot;Kleptomania&quot;, Draper claimed that he had started writing with Chad again, but later admitted that he had only been helping him build up backing tracks and had stopped turning up to the sessions anyway. In 2005 it was revealed Chad was involved with the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy charity and was also rumoured to be working in a care home and later a driver for St. John Ambulance in London. King had reportedly begun a career in Speedway racing.

A new official Mansun website was launched in January 2017, honouring the band&#x27;s back catalogue and legacy. Vinyl reissues and expanded CD sets of ”Attack of the Grey Lantern&quot; and &quot;Six&quot; were released in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

<text>USS &quot;Devilfish&quot; (SS/AGSS-292), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the devil fish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Devilfish&quot; was launched on 30 May 1943 by Cramp Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sponsored by Mrs. Frank W. Fenno Jr., and commissioned on 1 September 1944.

==Service history==
&quot;Devilfish&quot; aided the training program of the Fleet Sonar School at Key West from 18 October-2 November 1944. She reached Pearl Harbor on 2 December. On the last day of the year, she sailed on her first war patrol, putting into Saipan to refuel from 12 to 15 January 1945.

&quot;Devilfish&quot; patrolled the dangerous waters of Kii Suido and Bungo Suido off the island of Shikoku, and served as lifeguard for Army pilots making bombing japan 
on Japan. She refitted at Guam from 13 February-15 March, called at Saipan, and sailed on 16 March for her second war patrol.

Assigned to the area between Sagami Wan and the northern Nanpō Islands, &quot;Devilfish&quot; was attacked by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; plane on 20 March before she entered her patrol area. The plane crashed into her as the submarine was submerging, destroying the mast structure and causing serious leakage. &quot;Devilfish&quot; returned to Saipan and Pearl Harbor for repairs, departing Pearl Harbor on 20 May on her third patrol.

She sought targets in Bungo Suido and off northern Honshū, and on 16 June, in heavy seas, attacked an enemy submarine carrying a midget submarine on its deck. On 26 June, she attacked an escort ship, but in both cases the targets escaped. During this patrol she acted as lifeguard for strikes accompanying the Okinawa operation, and several times rendezvoused with other submarines to take off medical cases and previously rescued aviators.

&quot;Devilfish&quot; called at to Guam to refit from 7 July-2 August, then sailed to the Nanpō Islands for her fourth war patrol, during which her primary mission was lifeguard duty for the 3rd Fleet raids on Japan. On 10 August, she bombarded Tori Shima, and on 16 August, after the end of hostilities, departed for Midway and San Francisco.

There she was placed in commission in reserve on 18 April 1946, and out of commission in reserve on 30 September 1946. Laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, &quot;Devilfish&quot; was redesignated AGSS-292. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1967.

&quot;Devilfish&quot; was sunk by the submarine USS &quot;Wahoo&quot; (SS-565) off San Francisco, California on 14 August 1968, as part of a MK 16 MOD 8 torpedo test at in of water.

==Awards==
&quot;Devilfish&quot; received three battle stars for her World War II service; her second war patrol was designated as &quot;successful&quot;.

<doc id="1111837" wikidata="Q7550558" url="?curid=1111837" title="Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)">
<text>The Social Democratic Party of New Zealand was an early centre-left to left-wing political party. It existed only a short time before being amalgamated into the new Labour Party. During its period of existence, the party held two seats in Parliament.

==Unity Conference==
The Social Democratic Party was founded in January 1913 at a so-called &quot;Basis of Unity&quot; Conference (often simply called the &quot;Unity Conference&quot;). This meeting drew together the most prominent left-wing groups in New Zealand, including both political parties and trade unions. The aim was to unite the fractious labour movement into a cohesive force. At the end of the Conference, most of the attendees agreed to merge into two new organisations – the new United Federation of Labour would co-ordinate the trade unions, while the two main political parties (the hard-line Socialist Party and the moderate United Labour Party) would merge to form the Social Democrats. Not all members of the United Labour Party accepted the plan, however, and some continued on under the same banner and continued as a Rump party.

The Social Democrats were founded with the purpose of becoming &quot;...the political embodiment of working-class ideals aspirations&quot; in parliament.

Jack McCullough was the organiser for the Lower Riccarton branch and also organised campaigns for Christchurch City Council elections.

==Strike and 1914 election==
The Social Democrats gained a rapid boost when, shortly after their formation, Paddy Webb and James McCombs won by-elections and entered Parliament. They joined with John Robertson, who won a seat in the 1911 election as a Labour candidate bringing the Social Democrat caucus to three. Later the same year, however, a controversial strike broke out among groups of dockworkers and miners. Moderates in the union movement considered the strike ill-advised and dangerous, while radicals strongly supported it. The strike was heavily suppressed by the government of William Massey, and the United Federation of Labour was left broken and disorganised. The Social Democrats, still closely linked to the United Federation of Labour, were plunged into disarray, with three of the party&#x27;s leaders, Harry Holland, Peter Fraser and Bob Semple, being jailed for their roles in the strike.

As a result of the chaos, the Social Democrats went into the 1914 elections with little in the way of planning. Co-operation with local labour organisations was sporadic, as was co-operation with the remnants of the United Labour Party. However, union anger at the government for its &quot;heavy-handed&quot; response to the 1913 strikes was still strong, and the outbreak of World War I had also strengthened the labour vote. In the election, Paddy Webb and James McCombs retained their seats under the Social Democratic banner while the remnants of the United Labour Party won three seats, and a labour-aligned independent John Payne was also successful.

By 1915, the Social Democrats had in its ranks 2 MPs, 2 Mayors; 17 city and borough councillors, 6 members of hospital and charitable aid boards and 2 members of harbour boards.

The six labour-aligned MPs worked together in Parliament despite being from different parties, with Alfred Hindmarsh of the United Labour Party selected as the unified caucus&#x27; chairman. In August 1915, when Massey formed his Liberal-Reform coalition government, he extended an invitation to Hindmarsh&#x27;s caucus. The &quot;Labour&quot; members declined the offer and, as a result, became the official Opposition in Parliament.
==Formation of the Labour Party==

Two years later, in 1916, the close working relationship between the Social Democrats and the ULP remnant was formalised with a merger – the two officially came together as the Labour Party, the same organisation that survives today. The organisation of the Social Democratic Party survived however, and the more militant inclined members of the newly formed Labour Party remained as an &quot;alter-ego&quot; of Labour still campaigning for the goal of complete socialisation until their eventual disbandment in June 1922.

==List of presidents==
* Edward Tregear (1913–14)
* Hiram Hunter (1914–15)
* Frederick Cooke (1915–16)
* Peter Fraser (1916–18)
* Tom Brindle (1918–22)

<text>Martin Wingfield (born 1951) is a British far-right politician. Wingfield is long-standing figure in the British nationalist movement, he and his wife, Tina Wingfield, having contested several elections since the 1980s.

==Biography==
===National Front===
Disillusioned with the Liberal Party, Wingfield joined the National Front in 1976 and quickly rose in the party, winning election to the National Directorate in 1980. He became editor of the &quot;National Front News&quot; for a time, from 1983. He was briefly expelled from the party by John Tyndall after attempting to take control of the Sussex branch of the party from Tyndall&#x27;s father-in-law Charles Parker by publishing a dissident paper the &quot;Sussex Front&quot;.

With Ian Anderson, he was associated with the traditionalist Flag Group wing in opposition to the Political Soldier wing and became one of the leading members of this dissident group, editing their paper &quot;The Flag&quot;. Around this time he was criticized by leading Official National Front member Nick Griffin as being more suited to the extreme right-wing of the Conservative Party. In his role as editor of NF party organs Wingfield was charged under the Race Relations Act in 1985 for saying &quot;unless immigration is stopped, Crawley will end up one day like Brixton with all the problems and crime that that entails.&quot; After refusing to pay a fine, was imprisoned.

===National Democrats===
Wingfield was a member of the National Democrats (ND), continuing to edit &quot;The Flag&quot; for them and acting as the party&#x27;s press officer. In the 1997 General Election, he stood as the ND candidate for Wolverhampton North East constituency gaining 356 votes (0.9%); his wife, Tina, stood as a ND candidate for the Blackburn constituency gaining 671 votes (1.41%).

===British National Party===
In 2001, he joined the British National Party, and is currently the editor of the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Voice of Freedom&quot;. He was on the BNP candidate list for the North-West England regional constituency in the 2004 European Election and again in 2009, when party leader Nick Griffin was elected. He stood for Workington, as did his wife, Tina, for Salford and Eccles in the 2010 general election. In August 2011, after the BNP had a leadership challenge, both Martin and his wife had shown support to Andrew Brons and now face being sacked by the party for &#x27;breaching confidentiality&#x27;.

<text>Andrew Henry William Brons (born 3 June 1947) is a British politician and former MEP. Long active in far-right politics in Britain, he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Yorkshire and the Humber for the fascist British National Party (BNP) at the 2009 European Parliament election and held the seat until May 2014. He was the chairman of the National Front in the early 1980s. He resigned the BNP whip in October 2012 and became patron of the far-right British Democratic Party. He did not seek re-election in 2014.

==Family background and early life==
Brons, who has English and German ancestry, was born in Hackney, East London, two years after the end of the Second World War. He spent most of his childhood in Sidcup, on the outskirts of London, before his family moved to Harrogate when he was eleven years old. He attended Harrogate Grammar School until the age of sixteen, when he left to join the civil service, where he remained for 16 months before sitting part-time A-Levels in law and economics at Harrogate College. He studied politics at the University of York, and graduated in 1970.

After graduation, Brons started working as a lecturer at Harrogate College in 1970, and worked there until 2005; lecturing in A-Level law and government, and politics. He has two daughters.

==Political career==
===Early activity===
Brons began his political career in 1964 when, aged seventeen, he joined the National Socialist Movement (NSM), a Neo-Nazi organisation founded on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthday by Colin Jordan. In 1980, &quot;Searchlight&quot; published two letters Brons had written in 1965 to Françoise Dior, Jordan&#x27;s wife, in which he mentioned meeting an NSM member who &quot;mentioned such activities as bombing synagogues&quot;, stating in response to this that: &quot;On this subject I have a dual view, in that I realise that he is well intentioned, I feel that our public image may suffer considerable damage as a result of these activities. I am however open to correction on this point.&quot; The second letter requested materials such as a swastika, a copy of the Horst-Wessel-Lied, and posters and stickers in furtherance of Brons&#x27; goal of forming a local NSM group.

Questioned in 2009 about his membership of the National Socialist Movement, Brons said, &quot;People do silly things when they are seventeen. Peter Mandelson was once a member of the Young Communist League but we don&#x27;t continue to call him a Communist.&quot; Brons was forced to return to the issue in March 2011 when – on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Daily Politics&quot; programme – Dominic Carman, the Liberal Democrat candidate for the 2011 Barnsley Central by-election, called Brons, in his absence, a &quot;Nazi and an admirer of Adolf Hitler&quot;. In response Brons released a statement on his website, stating:

:&quot;It is on record that I was a member of the National Socialist Movement between the ages of seventeen and eighteen. I am now sixty-three, nearly sixty four – forty six years ago, nearly half a century! From the age of eighteen, I have been a committed supporter of Parliamentary democracy and the rule of law. The parties of which I have been a member, since then, have all been committed to democracy. Many Labour politicians have been members of the Communist Party in their teens, twenties and even thirties. Denis Healey was a member of the Communist Party at the height of the Stalinist purges. Would anybody be allowed to call Mr. Healey an avowed Communist and admirer of Joseph Stalin?&quot;

===National Front===
In 1965, Brons joined John Bean&#x27;s British National Party (not the same as the current incarnation), which later merged with the League of Empire Loyalists to form the National Front (NF) in 1967. Brons was voted onto the National Front&#x27;s national directorate in 1974, and &quot;as the NF&#x27;s education officer, he hosted seminars on racial nationalism and tried to give its racism a more &quot;scientific&quot; basis.&quot;

Brons contested Harrogate for the National Front in both February and October 1974 general elections, polling 1,186 votes (2.3%) in February and 1,030 (2.3%) in October. When Labour&#x27;s Roy Jenkins resigned his parliamentary seat on appointment as European Commission President in early 1977, Brons contested the Birmingham Stechford by-election for the National Front. He polled 2,955 votes (8.2%), forcing the Liberal candidate into fourth place.

====Leadership====
Following the poor showing by the National Front at the 1979 general election, and John Tyndall&#x27;s subsequent departure, Brons became Chairman of the NF in 1980 and in doing so broke with his former mentor. Brons, though, led the NF in name only. Initially Martin Webster, National Activities Organiser, exerted the most influence, before the Political Soldier wing of the party became more important. Brons tended to support the Flag Group although he lost influence to Ian Anderson and faded from his leading position. Nevertheless, Brons had links to the Political Soldier wing and is credited with having introduced the concept of distributism into the party, which formed a central part of the new ideology of the NF. Brons co-edited the NF journal &quot;New Nation&quot;, with Richard Verrall, the author of a work of holocaust denial, &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot;

Brons edited the National Front&#x27;s 1983 general election manifesto, which &quot;called for a global apartheid to prevent the &#x27;extinction&#x27; of whites everywhere.&quot; The manifesto declared that &quot;The National Front rejects the whole concept of multiracialism. We recognise inherent racial differences in Man. The races of Man are profoundly unequal in their characteristics, potential and abilities.&quot;

On at least two occasions in the early-1980s, Brons&#x27; far-right activities caused difficulties for his employer: on 24 June 1981, more than 500 student and Anti-Nazi League campaigners marched through Harrogate, taking over the college building where Brons was teaching; six protesters were arrested. In February 1982, more than 300 protesters clashed with 100 National Front supporters outside Brons&#x27; classroom in central Harrogate, and in the process two students were stabbed and six people arrested.

In October 1983, Brons called upon the principal of Harrogate College as a character witness, when Brons was convicted by magistrates of using insulting words and behaviour likely to cause a breach of the peace and fined £50. Brons had been leading a group leafleting in Leeds city centre. A shop assistant reported that the group had been shouting &quot;National Front&quot; and making clenched fist salutes, while an unnamed policeman is supposed to have heard &quot;white power&quot; and &quot;death to Jews&quot;. When a police officer of Malaysian origin asked the group to disperse, the policeman said that Brons replied: &quot;I am aware of my legal rights. Inferior beings like you probably do not appreciate the principle of free speech,&quot; - an allegation which Brons has always denied. His appeal to Leeds Crown Court was unsuccessful.

Although Brons continued as a leading member and even wrote a number of articles for the Political Soldier-supporting &quot;Nationalism Today&quot;, he was generally opposed to the positions of the &#x27;official&#x27; National Front and resigned from the chairmanship in November 1984. He left the &#x27;official&#x27; party altogether in 1986 but, unlike Webster who had been expelled in 1984, Brons became involved with the Flag Group, an NF Fronde. It was Brons who, in 1987, approached Tyndall with a view to an electoral alliance between the Flag Group and the modern British National Party but the proposed deal fell through and was repudiated by Martin Wingfield in &quot;The Flag&quot; newspaper.

===British National Party===
After leaving the &#x27;official&#x27; National Front, in 1986, Brons chiefly dedicated himself to the duties of his lectureship at Harrogate College until his retirement in 2005. However, he maintained his membership of the National Front (as the Flag Group became known on the dissolution of the &#x27;official&#x27; party in 1989) until 1999. Upon his retirement, Brons joined the BNP in 2005. He subsequently wrote at least two articles for the BNP&#x27;s official magazine &quot;Identity&quot;.

Brons had a &quot;tentative agreement&quot; to return to work at Harrogate College in September 2009. He had however been selected as BNP lead candidate for the European Elections 2009 in the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency, and upon becoming the BNP&#x27;s first Member of the European Parliament he declined the college&#x27;s offer.

Brons stood as a parliamentary candidate for the Keighley constituency at the 2010 general election. He came fourth in the election with 1,962 votes.

In August 2010, Brons and fellow members of the BNP Policy Committee were asked by the chairman and advisory council to carry out a consultation of members about possible changes to the party&#x27;s constitution, with particular reference to two areas, governance of the party nationally and the rules for internal elections. On 8 November, his findings were published online.

At the end of May 2011, Brons announced that he would seek nomination for the leadership of the British National Party in an internal election which would have been held in the autumn. Following constitutional changes rushed through by Nick Griffin, the leadership election was brought forward to the summer. Brons was narrowly defeated, receiving 1,148 votes to Griffin&#x27;s 1,157.

On 16 October 2012, Brons resigned the BNP whip following disputes with the party leader Griffin, stating that Griffin had described him &quot;in a text to his attack dogs as &#x27;vermin&#x27;&quot;. He continued as an MEP until 2014 when he did not stand for re-election.

===Member of the European Parliament===
Upon election to the European Parliament, Brons and his fellow BNP MEP Nick Griffin were heavily critical of any legislation, current or pending, which they saw as designed to reduce the national sovereignty and independence of member states or to have a negative impact on Britain. He was a member of the Constitutional Affairs Committee and a substitute for the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee.

====Committee on Croatia====
On entering the European Parliament Brons was designated to the Delegation to the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee this being a joint delegation to create dialogue with the Croatian Parliament at the time Croatia was a candidate country. On 29/30 March 2010, the delegation including Brons met in Zagreb, Brons spoke in the Croatian Parliament on the state of play of the accession negotiations and EU-Croatia relations in the presence of representatives of the Croatian Government. He went on to say:

:&quot;I am sometimes seen as somebody who exaggerates when I say that Croatia is about to surrender its independence so I shall let the Croatian people make that judgment. Unfortunately, they have not yet been consulted directly. I just hope that that consultation will be carried out freely and fairly. However, I note that the rules for referendums in the Constitution, the goal posts if you like, are being changed to facilitate a &#x27;Yes vote&#x27;.&quot;

Although having, made a direct speech as a warning to the Croatian Parliament, Brons ended with an abstention in voting to continue negotiations. He justified this by stating:

:&quot;I should like my abstention to be placed on record. I shall not vote against Croatia&#x27;s accession because that might imply that I have some right to act on behalf of Croatian opponents of accession, when I clearly have no such right. The Croatian people must decide for themselves. Furthermore, It might imply that I am somehow hostile to Croatia, when I am emphatically not hostile.&quot;

The remaining members of the committee voted unanimously in favour.

On 30 November 2010, Brons again spoke of the negative impact that EU accession would have on the Croatian people, this time in the European Parliament. He used the opportunity to express his concerns over the double standards of the EU in relation to the Lisbon Treaty; he also questioned member states governments&#x27; and media impartiality regarding the EU Question, saying:

:&quot;The referendum on accession must be free, fair and final. The debate must be conducted with full participation and media coverage for both sides of the debate. I do not want to prejudge the Croatian media but our experience in the UK in 1975 was that there was complete media support for EEC membership and a deluge of propaganda in favour of (continued) membership.&quot;

===British Democratic Party===
In November 2012, Brons and several other ex-BNP activists formed the British Democratic Party with himself as president of the party.

<text>Nanjemoy is a settlement along Maryland Route 6 in southwestern Charles County, Maryland, United States, and the surrounding large rural area more or less bounded by Nanjemoy Creek to the east and north, and the Potomac River to the south and west.

==Geography==
Nanjemoy is within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, approximately 25 miles (40 km) south of the Capital Beltway (Interstates 95 and 495).

The area is served by Maryland Route 6 and other two-lane state highways; the nearest major roads are Maryland Route 210 to the north and U.S. Route 301 to the east. The Nanjemoy area is becoming increasingly popular with Washington-area commuters, particularly those working in nearby Indian Head or Fort Washington in Maryland or in Alexandria, Virginia. The Waldorf, Maryland and La Plata, Maryland, commercial areas are nearby to the east, along U.S. 301. No rail lines presently serve the area. Other settlements in the Nanjemoy area include Grayton, Maryland Point, and Riverside. Chicamuxen, Doncaster, and Ironsides are nearby to the north.

The settlement lends its name to the Nanjemoy Formation, which outcrops on the nearby shores of the Potomac River. Other fossiliferous formations which outcrop nearby are the Aquia and basal Calvert Formations.

==Economy==
The village center includes a Post Office and a county-operated community center building that serves the area&#x27;s population. The area has two children&#x27;s camps and a sheriffs&#x27; training facility. Much of the Nanjemoy area is forest or farmland. Tobacco was formerly commonly cultivated in the area, but is now rarely grown there. 

==History==

Nanjemoy and the creek draw their names from a Native American tribe. 
The Confederate-sympathizing area saw occupation by a large force of the Union army during the early part of the American Civil War, with an encampment of about 12,000 soldiers near Chicamuxen, a few miles (kilometers) north of the Nanjemoy area.

In the last years of World War I, the Allied sea-power had been weakened by German submarines. The U.S. military used wooden ships, many of which were built and anchored in Widewater, Virginia, but the war ended before they could be used. Most ships were moved across the Potomac river to a secluded bay called Mallows Bay that served as a junkyard. Some were deconstructed but most of the ships sank. In 1970 a representative from the Audubon Society testified that the wrecks had become an &quot;integral part of the ecosystem.&quot; In the 1990s the area was found to contain longboats from the Revolutionary era and modern ships. The State of Maryland placed Mallows Bay in a protected status in 2002, and in September 3, 2019 the bay became part of the Mallows Bay–Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary. The sunken hulls of dozens of the ships still are visible at low tide at Mallows Bay, and they are regarded as the &quot;largest shipwreck fleet in the Western Hemisphere.&quot;

Famous people born in Nanjemoy include Raphael Semmes, captain of the Confederate cruiser &quot;CSS Alabama&quot;, and Matthew Henson, with whom Robert Peary explored the Arctic in 1909 and who with Peary may have discovered the North Pole.

==Wild areas==
The Nanjemoy area, on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, includes the largest great blue heron (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;) rookery in the Eastern United States north of Florida, now a preserve owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy.

The area also includes Purse State Park, well known for its fossil shark teeth, &quot;Turritella&quot; snails, and other fossils of Paleocene geological age, and other protected wild areas along the Potomac River&#x27;s freshwater tidal (estuarine) shore. Smallwood State Park, the Chicamuxen Wildlife Management Area, the Doncaster Demonstration Forest and Chapel Point State Park are also nearby.

The Nanjemoy Creek Environmental Education Center, operated by the Charles County Public School system, is located along Nanjemoy Creek. It offers trails, a boardwalk through a freshwater tidal marsh, a pier, a pavilion, a laboratory building, and several cabins for use by school groups. An observatory there, operated by the Southern Maryland Astronomical Society, has a dome formerly used nearby at a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory facility.

==Recreation==
Hunting and fishing have long been popular in the relatively undeveloped Nanjemoy area, and many miles of remote hiking trails are available. More recently, the area&#x27;s scenic, little-traveled roads have become popular with cyclists.

Public boat landings are provided on the Potomac at Mallows Bay and on the estuarine portion of Nanjemoy Creek at Friendship Landing, the latter also popular for fishing. Recreational boaters, mostly from the Woodbridge and Quantico areas on the Virginia side of the Potomac, frequently visit the extensive undeveloped river shore in the Purse State Park area. Kayaking is also increasing in popularity in the area, both on the Potomac and on the quiet tidewaters of Nanjemoy Creek.

<text>.ck is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Cook Islands.

== Registration ==
Registrations are within these second-level categories:
=== Requirements ===
Pre-requisites for applying for a domain is as follows:

# Non-resident domain applications cost €222.00 (EUR) for a minimum of 2 years, and must be renewed every 2 years thereafter.
# Applications for a domain if it is already taken or is not affiliated with brand or name identity to you or your company e.g. &#x27;nike.co.ck&#x27;, &#x27;mobil.co.ck&#x27;, etc.
# Domains considered profane will not be considered on any level, and the application will be dissolved with the applicant being notified, and future requests for the same domain name will be ignored. &#x27;.ck&#x27; domains are monitored on the web, on a regular basis for profanity on the Internet if it is found to be doing so, or if the site is deemed inappropriate, the domain will be terminated without notification or refund.

==Usage of .co.ck==
.co.ck has been used as a humorous domain suffix because of its similarity with the English vulgarity &quot;cock&quot;:
*In the British sitcom &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;, the principal character registers his website, &quot;trashbat&quot;, in the Cook Islands simply so that it has the suffix, which he always pronounces &quot;dot cock.&quot;
*One of the payloads of the MEMZ trojan causes a user&#x27;s computer to open satirical Google searches under &quot;Google.co.ck&quot;

<doc id="1111870" wikidata="Q6773603" url="?curid=1111870" title="Marshall Hall, Maryland">
<text>Marshall Hall, Maryland is the site of the Marshall family mansion. It is now part of Piscataway Park operated by the National Park Service. Marshall Hall is located near Bryans Road in Charles County, Maryland, next to the Potomac River, more or less across from Mount Vernon, Virginia, the home of George Washington. The home was one of the finest built on the Maryland shore of the Potomac in the early 18th century. The Marshall family were minor gentry and owned as many as 80 slaves by the early 19th century.

Soon after the Civil War, the site became a highly frequented picnic ground because of its proximity to Mount Vernon. Steamship lines, originally established to ferry tourists from Washington D.C. and Alexandria to/from Mount Vernon, discovered a new source of revenue in the park across from the historic estate. In the 1880s, the Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall Steamboat Company ran large ships between Washington, Alexandria, Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall: the round-trip fare at that time was $1, and included admission to Mount Vernon. Washingtonians fled the summer heat of the city for all sorts of events at the picnic grounds, from exclusive catered events to popular cultural events such as a swimming exhibition given by the daredevil Robert Emmet Odlum in the summer of 1878, seven years before his death at the Brooklyn Bridge. Marshall Hall later became one of the first amusement parks in the Washington, D.C., area in the 1890s, offering numerous &quot;appliances of entertainment&quot; (as one deed described them) for visitors who wanted to do more than picnic, many of them arriving by river boat. Starting in the 1870s, annual jousting tournaments took place at the site. New attractions were added throughout the 20th century, and gambling became a major draw for a while after World War II. Between 1949 and 1968, the Southern Maryland area offered the only legal slot machines in the United States outside of Nevada.

The National Park Service gained control of the park after Congress, acting upon a request from the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association, mandated that the views from Mt. Vernon had to be protected and returned to something resembling the days when George Washington sat on his colonnaded porch and looked across the Potomac. The term &quot;historic viewshed&quot; was coined for this act of preservation. The Park Service tore down all vestiges of the amusement park in 1980, whose popularity had declined due to competition by much larger, newer parks. A fire destroyed much of the colonial house soon after. In January 2003, a truck driver slammed his rig through the remaining hulk. The damage done to the brick shell was repaired the following year.

<text>Vítor Vieira Belfort (; born 1 April 1977) is a Brazilian professional boxer and retired mixed martial artist who competed for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he fought in the Heavyweight, Light Heavyweight, and Middleweight divisions. He is the UFC 12 Heavyweight Tournament Champion, as well as a former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and Cage Rage World Light Heavyweight Champion. Known for his explosive knockout power, Belfort is tied for fifth for the most finishes in UFC history with 14. Belfort also competed for MMA promotions Pride FC, Strikeforce, and Affliction.

==Background==
Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Belfort began training in boxing at the age of 12 under Claudio Coelho. Belfort later studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu with Carlson Gracie, who gave him his black belt. Gracie scouted Belfort at the Brazilian National Jiu-Jitsu Championships, where he won the Absolute and Heavyweight titles for blue belts under age 18. Belfort, 17 at the time, was invited to compete at Gracie&#x27;s gym, where he trained with the likes of Murilo Bustamante, Ricardo Loborio, Ricardo De La Riva, Mario Sperry, and Wallid Ismail.

==Mixed martial arts career==
At the age of 19, Belfort came to the United States to compete. In his first sanctioned mixed martial arts match, an event called Superbrawl in Hawaii, his opponent was Jon Hess, whom the young Brazilian defeated in 12 seconds by knockout, despite Hess having a seven-inch height advantage and a more than 100-pound weight advantage over Belfort.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
Soon after, he moved on to compete in the UFC, where he was given the nickname &quot;The Phenom&quot;. He beat two fighters in his debut event in the UFC, winning the &quot;UFC 12&quot; Heavyweight Tournament. At age 19, Belfort became the youngest fighter to score a victory inside the octagon. Belfort&#x27;s next match saw him score a technical knockout (TKO) against the &quot;UFC 6&quot; runner-up Tank Abbott in a non-tournament fight, knocking Abbott down and finishing him with a ground and pound attack.

====Heavyweight bouts====
In 1997 Belfort fought against American Greco-Roman wrestler Randy Couture, the first of three fights they would have. Belfort was upset by TKO 8:16 into the match, his boxing skills negated by Couture&#x27;s clinch fighting.

After this defeat, he would fight twice more in the UFC. The first of these fights was against a training partner of his, Joe Charles, whom he defeated quickly via armbar without throwing a single punch.

====Light heavyweight debut====
A year later, Belfort faced rising Brazilian star and future PRIDE Middleweight Champion Wanderlei Silva. Catching Silva early with a left cross, Belfort chased him across the cage with a flurry of punches, knocking Silva out by TKO in just 44 seconds.

===PRIDE Fighting Championships / Heavyweight sophomore===
Vítor then moved on to fight in Japan&#x27;s PRIDE Fighting Championships. His first opponent was Kazushi Sakuraba in 1999. Vítor controlled the first minutes of the fight before Sakuraba scored a takedown. He spent the remainder of the fight on his back being stomped and kicked by Sakuraba. Following the fight he stopped training with Carlson Gracie and started to train with Brazilian Top Team.

====Light heavyweight sophomore====
He fought in PRIDE against Alistair Overeem, Gilbert Yvel, Daijiro Matsui, Bobby Southworth, and Heath Herring. For these matches Belfort used his stand-up striking skills less and instead controlled the fights and won by ground-and-pound tactics, with the exception of his fight with Southworth, which he won via rear-naked choke in the first round. However, in the opening round of the 2005 Middleweight Grand Prix he faced Alistair Overeem, losing via first-round guillotine choke.

===Return to the UFC===
Returning to the UFC, Belfort was scheduled to fight Tito Ortiz in the main event of UFC&#x27;s first Las Vegas show at &quot;UFC 33&quot;. However, he sustained an injury prior to the event, and the bout was cancelled. Belfort eventually returned and fought Chuck Liddell (losing via decision), then Marvin Eastman (winning via TKO and opening a severe cut on Eastman&#x27;s eyebrow with a knee strike).

====Winning and losing the title/Belfort vs. Couture II &amp; III====
His next fight was on 31 January 2004, a rematch with Randy Couture for the UFC Light heavyweight Championship. Despite agonizing over his sister Priscila Belfort, who disappeared on 9 January, Vitor won the fight in 49 seconds after a seam from his glove cut Couture&#x27;s eye, leaving Couture with a corneal abrasion that prompted a referee stoppage. A third match between the two took place on 21 August 2004. Couture won via doctor stoppage after the third round, recapturing the title.

====Belfort vs. Ortiz====
His next fight in the UFC was against Tito Ortiz on 5 February 2005. The fight was Ortiz&#x27;s last fight on his contract. Belfort had early success in the first round, landing his best punches when the fight was on the feet, although he was taken down late in the round and took some of Ortiz&#x27;s best elbows. Belfort again had a strong start in the second but was taken down a second time and took damage from elbows late in the round. Both fighters were exhausted by round 3; Belfort was too tired to land a single punch and was taken down and dominated, with Ortiz again landing damaging elbows. After a hard-fought battle, Belfort lost a close split decision: some people, including then UFC Light heavyweight champion, Chuck Liddell believed he deserved to win the first as well as the second round, due to his octagon control and breaking Ortiz&#x27;s nose with punches, early in round one.

===Strikeforce===
Vitor then fought in Strikeforce for a rematch with Alistair Overeem, in which Belfort was defeated via unanimous decision.

===Return to Pride and steroid controversy===
At &quot;Pride 32: The Real Deal&quot; on 21 October 2006, Belfort lost a unanimous decision to Pride Welterweight Champion Dan Henderson. After the fight, Belfort tested positive for an illegal substance, 4-hydroxytestosterone. In his defense, Belfort argued that he had purchased an over the counter supplement which contained 4-Hydroxytestosterone. Belfort also explained that he may have received 4-Hydroxytestosterone as the result of rehabilitative injections given to him by Brazilian endocrinologist Dr. Rodrigo M. Greco after his surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his knee in the summer of 2006. The Nevada State Athletic Commission eventually received a statement from Dr. Greco stating that he did give Belfort post-surgical injections containing testosterone. While conceding that Belfort may have not known about the testosterone, the NSAC explained that even if Belfort was given injections by a medical practitioner who did not inform him that they contained anabolic steroids, it would still be a violation of the banned substances policy. On 21 December 2006, he was suspended for nine months from the date of the hearing and fined $10,000.

===Cage Rage===
Vítor Belfort defeated Ivan Serati by TKO at &quot;Cage Rage 21&quot; in England on 21 April 2007. He defeated James Zikic on 22 September 2007, at &quot;Cage Rage 23&quot; to claim the Cage Rage light heavyweight title in a unanimous decision. He entered the fight with a broken hand and during the fight threw minimal punches and utilized takedowns and ground and pound techniques.

===Affliction===
Vítor spent a brief time training for his Affliction fight against Terry Martin with Chute Boxe in Brazil. However, he completed his preparation for the fight at Xtreme Couture in Las Vegas. Randy Couture and Shawn Tompkins helped train him for the fight, in which he achieved a second-round KO by landing a flying knee and following up with an uppercut straight-left combination.

After the fight, Couture said Belfort was thinking about moving to Las Vegas and training at Xtreme Couture full-time.

Belfort&#x27;s next fight was slated to be against Matt Lindland at the second Affliction event, however, he was forced to pull out due to a hand injury sustained during the Terry Martin fight. The second Affliction event was postponed anyway and rescheduled for January 2009, enabling Vítor to fight on that card.

With rumours of a possible bout with reigning Dream Middleweight Grand Prix winner Gegard Mousasi circulating, it was announced that Vítor would finally fight Lindland at . Lindland was originally slated to fight Renato Sobral at a catchweight, but promoters of Affliction preferred the Belfort vs. Lindland fight at Middleweight. The fight ended in a KO at thirty-seven seconds, as Belfort delivered a strong left to Lindland&#x27;s jaw and followed up with four unanswered power shots as he hit the ground.

===Third UFC run===
During a press conference, Dana White announced that the UFC had re-signed Belfort to a contract. His first match was against Rich Franklin at a catchweight of 195 lbs, headlining UFC 103, which he won by knockout three minutes and two seconds into the first round. This fight earned him a $65,000 &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; award.

====Middleweight bouts, &amp; Title shot====
Belfort was expected to face Anderson Silva for the UFC Middleweight Championship on 2 January 2010, at UFC 108. However, Silva&#x27;s manager, Ed Soares, announced that Silva would not be fully recovered from his injury by that time, so the fight was postponed. Belfort was again slated to fight Silva on 6 February 2010, at UFC 109 and 10 April 2010, at UFC 112, respectively, but both fights were canceled because of a surgery for Silva and an injury suffered by Belfort. Belfort was scheduled to fight Yushin Okami at UFC 122. However, Dana White tweeted Belfort would instead challenge Silva at UFC 126 for the belt. Belfort lost by knockout after getting hit with a front kick to the face and taking two punches after falling to the mat.

Belfort made his return at UFC 133 against Yoshihiro Akiyama. Belfort initially thought the UFC would try to put him on the card at UFC 134 in Brazil, but the fight with Akiyama came together to help bolster the card in Philadelphia. Belfort contracted Hepatitis A in April, shortly after accepting the fight, but his representative, Pedro Lima, said that it would not jeopardize the bout with Akiyama. Belfort was successful in his return, winning the fight by knockout one minute and fifty-two seconds into the first round. This fight earned him another &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; award.

Belfort was briefly linked to a matchup with Cung Le, expected to take place on 19 November 2011, at UFC 139. However, Belfort was removed from the bout due to injury and replaced by Wanderlei Silva.

====Missed weight bout====
Belfort faced Anthony Johnson on 14 January 2012, at UFC 142. During the UFC 142 weigh ins, Johnson came in 11 pounds over the 186 lb weight allowance and was fined 20 percent of his earnings. Belfort requested that Johnson not weigh more than 205 lbs the day of the fight. The UFC had Johnson weigh in a second time. Johnson officially weighed in at 204 lbs on fight day, and the fight with Belfort proceeded as scheduled, with Belfort winning via rear naked choke in the first round, his first submission win in over a decade.

====The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil====
Belfort was selected to coach &quot;The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil&quot; against Wanderlei Silva. The rematch between Belfort and Silva was expected to take place on 23 June 2012, at UFC 147. However, on 27 May 2012, Belfort was forced to pull out of the bout, citing a broken hand in training, and replaced by Rich Franklin.

In a recent interview, Belfort expressed disinterest in actually fighting Wanderlei Silva. He told Fighters Only magazine, &quot;I guess Wanderlei will be able to fight in October but I only want that my next bout that accredits me to dispute the belt. I don’t know, maybe Michael Bisping. I was only defeated once recently, by Anderson Silva, and all my wins were very convincing.&quot; He further stated, &quot;I don’t know how long I will stay in this division. I wanted to do more two or three fights. If my body will no longer permit this big weight cutting, I will go up (to 205 lbs). I am not afraid of Jon Jones or somebody else... It&#x27;s not for me to choose my opponents.&quot;

====Third Light heavyweight title shot====
Belfort was expected to face Alan Belcher on 13 October 2012, at UFC 153. However, he replaced Lyoto Machida in a bout against Jon Jones at UFC 152 for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship after Machida rejected the offer due to lack of time to train before the fight. Despite almost submitting Jones via armbar in the first round, he was dominated during the remainder of the bout and submitted via keylock at 0:54 of the fourth round.

====Return to Middleweight====
Belfort returned to face Michael Bisping on 19 January 2013, at UFC on FX: Belfort vs. Bisping, winning via TKO due to a head kick and punches at 1:27 of the second round. Belfort injured Bispings right eye with his head kick. This fight earned him another &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; award.

Belfort faced the final Strikeforce Middleweight Champion and promotional newcomer Luke Rockhold on 18 May 2013, at UFC on FX: Belfort vs. Rockhold. He won the fight by a spinning wheel kick knockout in the first round. This fight earned him another &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; award.

====Return to Light heavyweight====
Belfort faced Dan Henderson at light heavyweight in a rematch on 9 November 2013, at UFC Fight Night 32. Belfort defeated Henderson via first-round knockout to become the first person to defeat Henderson via strikes. The win also earned Belfort his fifth &quot;Knockout of the Night&quot; bonus award.

====Middleweight return====
Belfort was expected to face UFC middleweight champion Chris Weidman at UFC 173. However, Belfort chose to withdraw from the fight following the Nevada State Athletic Commission&#x27;s ban on exemptions for testosterone replacement therapy and was replaced by Lyoto Machida. Subsequently, Belfort revealed that he had failed a random drug test in February, due to elevated levels of testosterone.

Belfort was expected to face Chael Sonnen on 5 July 2014, at UFC 175 as a replacement for Wanderlei Silva. However, Sonnen failed a random drug test and was removed from the bout. The following day it was announced by MMA writer Kevin Iole that Belfort had also been removed from the card due to the inability of the UFC to find him a new opponent.

Belfort was expected to face Weidman on 6 December 2014, at UFC 181. However, on 22 September, it was announced that Weidman had suffered a broken hand and the bout was again rescheduled to take place on 28 February 2015, at UFC 184. In turn, on 30 January 2015, the UFC announced that Weidman had pulled out of the bout again, citing an injury he sustained in training. The bout with Weidman eventually took place on 23 May 2015, at UFC 187. Belfort found initial success with a flurry of punches early in the opening of the first round, but Weidman survived them, secured a takedown, achieved the mount position and defeated Belfort via TKO due to punches.

Belfort faced Dan Henderson in a rubber match at UFC Fight Night 77 on 7 November 2015. He again defeated Henderson via a combination of head kick and punches. The win also earned Belfort his first and only &quot;Performance of the Night&quot; bonus award.

Belfort next faced Ronaldo Souza on 14 May 2016, at UFC 198 He lost the fight via TKO in the first round.

A long discussed fight with Gegard Mousasi took place on 8 October 2016, at UFC 204. Belfort lost the fight via TKO in the second round.

Belfort faced Kelvin Gastelum on 11 March 2017, at UFC Fight Night 106. He lost the fight via a combination of punches in the first round resulting in a K.O. However, Gastelum subsequently tested positive for marijuana and the result was overturned to a No Contest.

==Personal life==
Belfort was born on 1 April 1977, in Rio de Janeiro to a French-Brazilian father and a Greek-Brazilian mother. He is married to Joana Prado, with whom he has three children. They started dating in 2000 and broke up, but reunited during a reality show in 2002. The same year, Belfort appeared with Joana when she was photographed for the Brazilian edition of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

On 9 January 2004, Belfort&#x27;s sister, Priscila, disappeared and the relatives received no information about her. In August 2007, a woman identified as Elaine Paiva confessed that she participated in her kidnapping and killing, and that she was kidnapped to pay off a four thousand dollar debt Paiva had with drug dealers. Paiva was arrested along with three others alleged to be involved in the kidnapping. The group allegedly buried her body in the woods in Rio de Janeiro where police conducted searches, but her remains have never been found. Her family however does not accept this version of events, and believes that Priscila is still alive somewhere. Belfort still maintains a missing page on the Brazilian version of his website.

Belfort speaks Portuguese, English, and Spanish. He is a devout Christian. Belfort believes the most important key to his success and longevity in the sport is that he is happy with what he does. &quot;I just thank God every day. I’m happy. I’m healthy. Bottom line is it&#x27;s just the way you treat life and life will treat you back. Make sure you’re happy with whatever is going on in your life. I think the key of life is just be happy with what&#x27;s in front of you and the decision of my life is under God and God knows what&#x27;s best for me.&quot; Belfort also appeared in a testimonial video on I Am Second, in which he shares his story of his faith in Jesus Christ.

Belfort&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Vitor Belfort: Lições de garra, fé e sucesso&quot; was published by Thomas Nelson Brazil in 2012.

Belfort appears in the video for the song &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; by The Almost.

<text>.cm is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of Cameroon. 

==History==
In August 2006, it was reported that the .cm registry had set up a wildcard DNS record, so that all unregistered domains in this top-level domain go to a parking page with paid search links. This was likely intended to take advantage of typographical errors by users attempting to reach .com web sites.

Auctions of .cm domains have been as high as $81,000 in 2009 for what pitchmen have termed &quot;prime real estate&quot;. However, some bloggers have noted that nothing of any real value was actually put up for auction, despite the price war.
Namejet.com, the official auction site for the .CM domain registrar Netcom.cm, sold over $500,000 in .cm domain names the first day and over $2 million in the first week.

==Reputation==
In a report published in December 2009 by McAfee, &quot;Mapping the Mal Web - The world&#x27;s riskiest domain&quot;, .cm was reportedly the riskiest domain in the world, with 36.7% of the sites posing a security risk to PCs. It is widely assumed that malicious domain programmers rely on inadvertent misspellings of well-trafficked websites ending in &quot;.com&quot; to lure unsuspecting users to their domains.

The .cm top-level domain is also used for domain name hacks by legitimate organizations, such as the CyanogenMod project, which used codice_1 as an easily remembered URL shortener for distributing versions of its software, and &quot;The Hill&quot;, which uses codice_2 as a URL shortener when linking to its articles on social media.

<text>Emperor Wuzong of Tang (July 2, 814 – April 22, 846), né Li Chan, later changed to Li Yan just before his death, was an emperor of the Tang dynasty of China, reigning from 840 to 846. Emperor Wuzong is mainly known in modern times for the religious persecution that occurred during his reign. However, he was also known for his successful reactions against incursions by remnants of the Uyghur Khanate and the rebellion by Liu Zhen, as well as his deep trust and support for chancellor Li Deyu.

== Background ==
Li Chan was born in 814, as the ninth son of Li Heng at least, who was then Crown Prince under Li Chan&#x27;s grandfather Emperor Xianzong. He was born at the Eastern Palace (i.e., the Crown Prince&#x27;s palace). His mother was Consort Wei, whose rank was lost to history. After Li Heng became Emperor Muzong in 820, he made many of his brothers and sons princes in 821, and Li Chan was made the Prince of Ying. Little is known about Li Chan&#x27;s activities during the reigns of Emperor Muzong or Li Chan&#x27;s older brothers Emperor Jingzong (Emperor Muzong&#x27;s oldest son) and Emperor Wenzong (Emperor Muzong&#x27;s second son), other than that during the middle of Emperor Wenzong&#x27;s &quot;Kaicheng&quot; era (836–840), Emperor Wenzong bestowed the honorary title of &quot;Kaifu Yitong Sansi&quot; () on him, as well as the title of honorary minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, &quot;Libu Shangshu&quot;). It was said that Li Chan was silent, intelligent, and decisive, not showing his emotions easily. It was also said that Emperor Wenzong treated him and another brother, Li Rong the Prince of An, better than other princes.

Emperor Wenzong originally created his son Li Yong crown prince, but after Li Yong died in 838, he was unsure whom to make his successor. Emperor Wenzong&#x27;s favorite concubine Consort Yang recommended Li Rong, but when Emperor Wenzong consulted the chancellors, Li Jue opposed this proposal. Emperor Wenzong thus, in 839, created Emperor Jingzong&#x27;s youngest son Li Chengmei the Prince of Chen crown prince. When Emperor Wenzong became seriously ill early in 840, he had his trusted eunuchs Liu Hongyi () and Xue Jileng () summon the chancellors Yang Sifu and Li Jue to the palace, intending to entrust Li Chengmei to them. However, the powerful eunuchs Qiu Shiliang and Yu Hongzhi (), who were not consulted in the decision, opposed Li Chengmei, and despite Li Jue&#x27;s objection, forged an edict in Emperor Wenzong&#x27;s name deposing Li Chengmei by claiming that Li Chengmei was too young, and creating Li Chan crown prince instead. Subsequently, Qiu and Yu had soldiers escort Li Chan from his mansion to the palace and, after Emperor Wenzong then died, persuaded Li Chan to order Consort Yang, Li Chengmei, and Li Rong all to commit suicide. After a short mourning period, Li Chan took the throne (as Emperor Wuzong).

== Reign ==

===Religious persecution===

Buddhism had flourished into a major religious force in China during the Tang period, and its monasteries enjoyed tax-exempt status. Because they didn&#x27;t contribute taxes, Emperor Wuzong believed Buddhism to be a drain on the state&#x27;s economy. Coupled with his devotion to Taoism as well and his deep trust in the Taoist monk Zhao Guizhen (), he set out to act against Buddhism, initiating an imperial edict in 842 weeding out sorcerers and convicts from the ranks of the Buddhist monks and nuns, and returning them to lay life. Monks and nuns were to turn their wealth over to the government unless they returned to lay life and paid taxes. During this first phase, Confucian arguments for the reform of Buddhist institutions and the protection of society from Buddhist influence and practices were predominant.

The religious persecution reached its height in the year 845 CE, ultimately confiscating the Buddhist temple properties, destroying 4,600 Buddhist temples and 40,000 shrines, and removing 260,500 monks and nuns from the monasteries. Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s reasons for doing so were not purely economic. A zealous Taoist, Wuzong considered Buddhism a foreign religion that was harmful to Chinese society. One notable victim of the persecution was the Japanese Tendai monk Ennin.

Among its purposes were to raise war funds and to cleanse China of foreign influences. As such, the persecution was directed not only towards Buddhism but also towards other foreign religions, such as Zoroastrianism, Nestorian Christianity, and Manichaeism. Only the native Chinese ideologies of Confucianism and Taoism survived the upheaval relatively unaffected. He all but destroyed Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in China, and his persecution of the growing Nestorian Christian churches sent Chinese Christianity into a decline from which it never recovered.

At the same time, Wuzong went far to promote Taoist worship in China through religious regulations and the construction of the Temple for Viewing Immortals in the Imperial court. (Emperor Wuzong was one of the last Tang emperors and ruled China during a long period of decline; despite his reforms, he was unable to revive the empire through his religious persecutions. After his death, with the help of his uncle Emperor Xuānzong, Buddhism was able to recover from the persecution; but Christianity, Manichaeism, and Zoroastrianism never again played as significant a role in Chinese religious life.)

=== Dealing with the Huigu incursions ===
By the time that Emperor Wuzong took the throne, his mother Consort Wei had already died, and he posthumously honored her as an empress dowager. Also, knowing that Yang Sifu and Li Jue had not supported him as Emperor Wenzong&#x27;s successor, he had them removed from their offices. He instead installed Li Deyu, former chancellor under Wenzong, as a chancellor and effectively put most of the responsibilities of governance in his hands. (In 841, Emperor Wuzong further ordered Liu Hongyi and Xue Jileng to commit suicide and planned to order Yang and Li Jue to do so as well, but Yang and Li Jue were spared (and only demoted) after the intercession by Li Deyu and the other chancellors, Cui Gong, Cui Dan, and Chen Yixing.)

One of the first things that Emperor Wuzong had to deal with was the collapse of Tang&#x27;s erstwhile vassal and ally Huigu—which had supported Tang in various campaigns through the decades. In 840, due to internal power struggles, Huigu was weakened, such that when the Xiajiasi (Kirghiz) khan Are () attacked, the Huigu khan Yaoluoge Hesa () was killed. The Huigu tribespeople scattered, fleeing in various directions. One major group, under the leadership of the prince Wamosi and the nobles Chixin (), Pugu (), and Najiachuo (), headed for the Tang border city of Tiande (天德, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) and sought to submit to Tang. The leader of another major group, the noble Yaoluoge Wuxi, claimed the khan title for himself (as Wujie Khan). Wujie Khan subsequently seized Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s aunt Princess Taihe, who had married a previous khan (Chongde Khan), and held her hostage. Various Huigu remnants pillaged the Tang border regions, causing much disturbance for the Tang people. At Li Deyu&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Wuzong supplied food to the Huigu remnants to try to calm them, while accepting Wamosi&#x27;s submission. When Wujie Khan subsequently demanded that Tang turn Wamosi over to him as a traitor, Emperor Wuzong refused.

Subsequently, Wujie Khan&#x27;s forces and Tang&#x27;s border defense forces came into open combat, even though both sides continued negotiations. In 843, the Tang general Liu Mian () launched a surprise attack against Wujie Khan, led by his officer Shi Xiong. Shi crushed Wujie Khan&#x27;s forces and rescued Princess Taihe. Wujie Khan fled, and subsequently, the Huigu remnants created only minor nuisances for Tang and no longer posed a major threat.

=== The Zhaoyi campaign ===
Immediately after the dissipation of the Huigu threat, however, Emperor Wuzong faced a crisis of a different kind. In 843, Liu Congjian the military governor (&quot;Jiedushi&quot;) of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), who had governed Zhaoyi in &quot;de facto&quot; independence from the imperial government and who had a strident rivalry with Qiu Shiliang, was seriously ill, and Liu wanted his adoptive son (and biological nephew) Liu Zhen to succeed him, and set up the power structure at the circuit to facilitate the transition. He submitted petitions requesting that Liu Zhen be allowed to take over the circuit. When Liu Congjian thereafter died, Liu Zhen sought to inherit the circuit. Li Deyu, believing that this would be a prime opportunity for the imperial government to seize control of Zhaoyi Circuit, advocated a campaign against Liu Zhen, and Emperor Wuzong agreed.

Initially, the imperial government was concerned that three other &quot;de facto&quot; independent circuits north of the Yellow River (Weibo (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), then governed by He Hongjing; Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), then governed by Wang Yuankui; and Lulong (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing, then governed by Zhang Zhongwu) would side with Zhaoyi. Emperor Wuzong secured their cooperation by effectively promising the three circuits that he would not interfere with their independence, and in fact secured the military cooperation of both Weibo and Chengde in the campaign against Zhaoyi by leaving the task of capturing Zhaoyi&#x27;s three eastern prefectures, east of the Taihang Mountains, to Wang and He Hongjing. The other imperial generals, including Wang Zai, Shi Xiong, and Liu Mian, concentrated on Zhaoyi&#x27;s two western prefectures, including its capital Lu Prefecture (). Initially, the imperial forces could not advance well against Zhaoyi forces, and the campaign was complicated by a mutiny by the officer Yang Bian () at Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) early in 844. Yang&#x27;s mutiny was quickly put down, however, and the imperial forces continued their assault on Zhaoyi. In fall 844, the three eastern prefectures surrendered to He Hongjing and Wang Yuankui, and soon thereafter, Liu Zhen was killed by his own officer Guo Yi (), who then surrendered.

=== After the Zhaoyi campaign ===
After the Zhaoyi campaign, Li Deyu used the opportunity to carry reprisals against his political enemies in the Niu-Li Factional Struggles—those who were members of what would later be referred to as the Niu Faction (named after Niu Sengru) against Li Deyu&#x27;s Li Faction—including the former chancellors Niu Sengru and Li Zongmin—by accusing them of complicity in Liu Zhen&#x27;s rebellion. As a result, Niu and Li Zongmin were exiled to remote regions.

In 845, Emperor Wuzong wanted to create his favorite concubine, Consort Wang, empress. Li Deyu, pointing out that Consort Wang was of low birth and that she was sonless, opposed. Emperor Wuzong therefore did not do so. (Emperor Wuzong had five known sons, but very little is known about them other than their names and their princely titles.)

Late in Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s life, he began taking pills made by Taoist alchemists, which were intended to lead to immortality, and it was said that his mood became harsh and unpredictable as a side effect. By late 845, he was seriously ill. In early 846, in an attempt to ward off the illness, he changed his name to Li Yan—under the theory that under the Wu Xing cosmology, his original name of Chan () contained two instances of earth () while only containing one instance of water (), which meant that he was getting suppressed by the dynasty&#x27;s own spirits (as Tang beliefs included that the dynasty was protected by earth), while Yan () contained two instances of fire (), which was more harmonious with earth. Despite this change, his conditions did not get better. The eunuchs, believing that Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s uncle Li Yi the Prince of Guang to be simple-minded, decided to make him Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s successor; they therefore had an edict issued in Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s name creating Li Yi crown prince (and changing Li Yi&#x27;s name to Li Chen). Soon thereafter, Emperor Wuzong died after drinking an elixir of immortality, and Li Chen took the throne as Emperor Xuānzong.

<doc id="1111889" wikidata="Q6776861" url="?curid=1111889" title="Martin Webster">
<text>Martin Guy Alan Webster (born 14 May 1943) is a British neo-Nazi, a former leading figure on the far-right in the United Kingdom. An early member of the National Labour Party (NLP), he was John Tyndall&#x27;s closest ally, and followed him in joining the original British National Party (BNP), the National Socialist Movement (NSM) and the Greater Britain Movement. Webster also spent time in prison for helping to organise a paramilitary organisation, Spearhead, and was convicted under the Public Order Act 1936. Rumours of his homosexuality led to him becoming vilified in far-right circles, and he quietly disappeared from the political scene.

==Early political activism==
An early member of the Young Conservatives, from which he claimed to have been expelled, Webster was associated loosely with the League of Empire Loyalists until he joined the National Socialist Movement (NSM) in 1962. He became Tyndall&#x27;s closest ally within the NSM, and followed him in joining the Greater Britain Movement. Webster also spent time in prison for knocking Jomo Kenyatta to the ground outside the London Hilton hotel, and for helping to organise the paramilitary organisation Spearhead. He was convicted under the Public Order Act 1936. He attracted further notice in 1972 when he was recorded as saying, &quot;We are busy setting up a well-oiled Nazi machine in this country.&quot;

==National Front==
===With Tyndall===
He continued to be a lieutenant to Tyndall, and followed him into the National Front (NF). Webster proved an early success in the NF, being appointed National Activities Organiser in 1969, and from that position effectively shared the leadership of the party with Tyndall until 1974. Webster clashed with Tyndall&#x27;s replacement John Kingsley Read, and the clash set in motion Kingsley Read&#x27;s downfall, allowing Tyndall to return to the leadership. Webster later broke with Tyndall, while remaining one of the most prominent figures in the NF during the subsequent chairmanship of Andrew Brons.

Shortly after the police decided, under the Public Order Act 1936, to ban an NF march through Hyde town centre on the grounds that it was likely to be a focus of &quot;serious disturbances&quot;, Webster announced in October 1977 that there would be two NF marches, the second being conducted by him alone. Watched by a crowd of members of the public and surrounded by an estimated 2,500 police, he marched down the main street of Hyde carrying a Union Flag and a sign reading &quot;Defend British Free Speech from Red Terrorism&quot;. Webster was allowed to march, as &#x27;one man&#x27; did not constitute a breaking of the ban. The tactic split the Anti-Nazi League (ANL) in two and made a farce of the ban, while attracting more media publicity for the NF.

In 1982, Webster – after making claims about the activities of the ANL – was sued for libel by Peter Hain, then one of its leading members. In court, he admitted that ANL activity had severely damaged the NF.

===Later NF activity and expulsion===
Rumours of Webster&#x27;s homosexuality led to his becoming vilified within right-wing nationalist circles, and he also fell foul of the Political Soldier wing of the NF. In 1983, they ensured that he lost his position as National Activities Organiser, then deprived him of his place on the National Directorate, before expelling him from the party altogether along with his ally Michael Salt.

==Our Nation==
Webster briefly attempted to lead his own group, Our Nation, although this was to prove unsuccessful. He viewed his new movement as being along the lines of the NF before the resignation of Tyndall; however, they had clashed before the expulsion, and so Webster was not invited to join Tyndall&#x27;s British National Party (BNP). Webster sought out Françoise Dior, who had by then split from Colin Jordan and returned to France, as a source of funding. Despite managing to secure a small sum from Dior, he soon found that his low reputation across the far right made it very difficult for him to attract members to his movement. Although long-standing activist Denis Pirie played a role in organising the group, his input was cut short by newspaper articles revealing that he had been involved whilst employed at a high level in the civil service. As a result, Our Nation never really got off the ground; before long Webster was forced to abandon his plans. He was not admitted to the Flag Group after Ian Anderson had supported his initial expulsion from the NF (despite being otherwise an opponent of Nick Griffin and Patrick Harrington).

==Current activity==
Webster has been semi-retired from political activity for some time (although he was associated with Lady Birdwood before her death). He re-emerged in 1999, to claim that he had a four-year homosexual affair with Nick Griffin (in 1999, the newly elected BNP leader) that had begun in the mid-1970s, when Griffin was a teenager. Griffin has denied any such relationship.

Webster composes occasional e-bulletins, under the title &quot;Electronic Loose Cannon&quot;, and &quot;Electronic Watch on Zion&quot;. He has also written for &quot;The Occidental Observer&quot; website.

In 2010, Webster spoke at the 29th meeting of the New Right, giving a lecture on the Middle East conflict in favour of the Palestinian cause. In August 2011, he spoke at the 29th New Right meeting on Justice for the Palestinians.

<text>.cv is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Cape Verde. It is managed by the National Communications Agency (, ARME). 

== History ==
It was introduced on 21 October 1996 and initially it was managed by the Instituto Superior de Engenharia e Ciências do Mar (ISECMAR), later the School of Maritime Sciences, and finally a campus of the University of Cape Verde, until its redelegation in August 2009 by the current National Communications Agency.

The technical manager, originally the Foundation for the National Scientific Information of Portugal (, FCCN), a non-profit organisation who managed the .pt domain name, transferred the rights and obligations managing the top level domains to DNS.PT in 2014. The transfer of management rights by the IANA was published for .cv in June of that year.

ARME is part of the group LusNIC, an entity which includes top-level domains of other countries including .br (Brazil), .gw (Guinea-Bissau), .pt (Portugal), .st (São Tomé and Príncipe) and .ao (Angola). This is why the .cv domain shares a part of the .pt network infrastructure (notably for a part of its DNS servers), and its technical management is delegated to the DNS.PT association.

In 2024 the registry awarded a five year contract to OlaCV to manage the TLD. With this relaunch there was a change in registration procedure, the earlier exclusive registrar was discontinued and instead international registrars can accredit themselves and use a fully automated system. The relaunch also sees a new marketing stategy using .cv as curricula vitae.

== Structure ==
Registrations are possible in the second level. ARME has additionally defined the following third-level TLDs, each with specific target users:
* .net.cv: communication and network services
* .gov.cv: governmental institutions
* .org.cv: nonprofit organizations
* .edu.cv: schools and universities (both public and private)
* .int.cv: international organizations and diplomatic missions
* .publ.cv: periodical magazines registered with the Directorate General of Social Communication
* .com.cv: not restricted, intended for commercial entities
* .nome.cv: Cape Verde nationals and legal residents.

<doc id="1111897" wikidata="Q7722032" url="?curid=1111897" title="Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc.">
<text>The Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc., 381 F.3d 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2004) is a legal case heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concerning the anti-trafficking provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), , in the context of two competing universal garage door opener companies. It discusses the statutory structure and legislative history of the DMCA to help clarify the intent of the anti-circumvention provisions and decide who holds the burden of proof. It expresses that the statute creates a cause of action for liability and does not create a property right, and holds that as Chamberlain had alleged that Skylink was in violation of the anti-trafficking provision, it had the burden to prove and failed to show that access was unauthorized and its rights were infringed under the Copyright Act. As Chamberlain incorrectly argued that Skylink had the burden of proof and failed to prove their claim, the court upheld summary judgment in favor of Skylink.

== Background of the case ==
This case involves two competitors that produce universal garage door openers (GDOs). Universal garage door openers are used when people want to replace or purchase a spare transmitter to open their garage door. They are designed to interoperate with existing GDO systems, regardless of model.

Chamberlain markets a &quot;Security+&quot; line of GDOs which includes rolling code software that actively alters the transmitted signal by cycling through a series of strings (of which only some are able to open the door). This rolling code is designed to protect against a potential &quot;code grabbing&quot; attack where a nearby burglar may try to record the garage door opening signal. Chamberlain claims that the rolling code system makes it unlikely for a burglar to send a valid signal by replaying the recorded one. With rolling code protection, a garage door will open if and only if the transmitted code is not among the last 1024 used codes and it is among the next 4096 codes. The Security+ has additional functionality that will cause the GDO to resynchronize when two signals out of the acceptable range are transmitted in rapid succession. This was added in the case that homeowners use the same transmitter on multiple garage doors.

In 1992, Skylink produced a universal transmitter called Model 39 that was designed to work for both rolling code and non-rolling code GDOs. The Model 39 bypasses the Chamberlain&#x27;s rolling code system by imitating Security+&#x27;s resynchronization feature. The Model 39 transmitter sends three fixed codes in rapid succession; this either causes the door to open due to the first code or it causes the door to resynchronize and open due to the latter two codes.

==Relevant law==
This case involves the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b) states:
No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that—

(A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title;

== Procedural history ==
Chamberlain sued Skylink in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in two cases. In the first case, &quot;Chamberlain I&quot;, Chamberlain alleged that Skylink&#x27;s actions violated the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA and moved for summary judgment. The court denied Chamberlain&#x27;s motion for summary judgment. In the second case, &quot;Chamberlain II&quot;, Chamberlain alleged that Skylink infringed their patents and violated the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA.

With regards to the DMCA claim in &quot;Chamberlain II&quot;, Chamberlain contended that:
#Model 39 was designed to circumvent the protection mechanism placed by Chamberlain&#x27;s rolling code (infringing §1201(a)(2)(A)). 
#It has limited commercial use other than to circumvent the rolling code (infringing §1201(a)(2)(B)).
#It was marketed to circumvent that technology (infringing §1201(a)(2)(C)).

In response, Skylink claimed that &quot;consumers use the Model 39 transmitter to activate the Security+ GDOs with Chamberlain&#x27;s consent.&quot; §1201(a)(3)(A) states that to &quot;circumvent a technological measure&quot; means to &quot;descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner.&quot; They also claimed that the Model 39 transmitter served a variety of functions that were unrelated to circumvention, that Chamberlain had failed to demonstrate that its GDOs contained a computer program protected by copyright, that Skylink had not violated the DMCA because its acts fell within a safe harbor provision per §1201(f), and that Chamberlain&#x27;s rolling code computer program did not protect a copyrighted computer program, but instead protects an uncopyrightable process.

Chamberlain claimed that (1) Skylink had the burden to prove that their use was authorized and (2) Chamberlain &quot;never gave consumers explicit authorization to program competing universal transmitters into its rolling code openers.&quot;

The District Court agreed with Skylink and because Chamberlain did not explicitly restrict the consumer&#x27;s use of alternate transmitters, this was deemed an unconditional sale that implicitly authorized customers to use other transmitters. The court also noted that Chamberlain&#x27;s construction and interpretation of the DMCA would make its own consumers violate §1201(a)(1), which prohibits circumvention of a technological measure that controls access.

As Chamberlain did not show that Skylink&#x27;s access was unauthorized, the District Court granted the motion for summary judgment to Skylink and dismissed the patent claims.

==Appeal issues==
Chamberlain appealed the District Court&#x27;s decision of summary judgment granted to Skylink in &quot;Chamberlain II&quot; and the case was heard before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In this case, Chamberlain claimed the District Court incorrectly placed the burden on Chamberlain to prove that the circumvention of its technological measures was unauthorized when it should have placed the burden on Skylink to show that the use was authorized.

==Decision==
The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court&#x27;s ruling. The court explained that by explicitly stating that circumvention occurs &quot;without the authority of the copyright owner,&quot; the DMCA requires the plaintiff alleging circumvention to show that the defendant&#x27;s access was unauthorized.

The Federal Circuit went on to clarify the nature of the DMCA&#x27;s anti-circumvention provisions. The DMCA established causes of action for liability and did not establish a property right. Therefore, circumvention is not infringement in itself.

In response to Chamberlain&#x27;s assertions that the DMCA &quot;renders the pre-DMCA history in the GDO industry irrelevant,&quot; &quot;fundamentally altered the legal landscape,&quot; and &quot;overrode all pre-existing consumer expectations about the legitimate uses of products containing copyrighted embedded software,&quot; the court disagreed. In Chamberlain&#x27;s view, all use of products that contain copyrighted software and use protective technological measures would violate the DMCA and this would give companies a loophole around antitrust laws as well as take away the fair use defense. By examining the structure and history of the statute and the intent of Congress, the court attempted to interpret the statutory language. The court found that the goals of the DMCA were to establish a balance between the competing interests of content owners and information users and balance access control measures with fair use.

Chamberlain had the burden to prove that (1) they had ownership of a copyrighted work, (2) it was controlled by a technological measure that was circumvented, (3) third parties can access it (4) without authorization in a way that (5) infringes rights protected by the Copyright Act due to a product created, advertised, or provided by the defendant Skylink. Once the plaintiff proves those five they must also prove that the defendant trafficked in a product which was (i) designed or produced primarily for circumvention; (ii) made available despite only limited commercial significance other than circumvention; or (iii) marketed for use in circumvention of the controlling technological measure. Chamberlain never claimed that Skylink infringed its copyrights or contributed to third-party infringement nor did it show that its users were unauthorized to use the product. As Chamberlain failed to show the fourth and fifth requirements to prove their claim, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court&#x27;s grant of summary judgment to Skylink, writing,
Chamberlain, however, has failed to show not only the requisite lack of authorization, but also the necessary fifth element of its claim, the critical nexus between access and protection. Chamberlain neither alleged copyright infringement nor explained how the access provided by the Model 39 transmitter facilitates the infringement of any right that the Copyright Act protects. There can therefore be no reasonable relationship between the access that homeowners gain to Chamberlain&#x27;s copyrighted software when using Skylink&#x27;s Model 39 transmitter and the protections that the Copyright Act grants to Chamberlain.

<text>Lillian Gertrud Asplund (October 21, 1906 – May 6, 2006) was an American secretarial worker who was one of the last three living survivors of the sinking of on April 15, 1912, and the last living survivor with memories of the disaster.

==Early life==

Lillian Asplund was born on October 21, 1906, in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States, to Carl and Selma (née Johansson) Asplund, both immigrants from Sweden. Her parents had lived briefly in Missouri prior to settling in Worcester. Lillian had a twin brother, Carl, two older brothers, Filip (born 1898), Clarence (born 1902) and younger brother Felix (born 1909), who was the only other survivor besides her mother and herself.

In 1907, Lillian&#x27;s family received word that Lillian&#x27;s paternal grandfather had died back in Sweden. As her father was the executor of his estate, the family made arrangements to return to Sweden to settle the estate of the family farm, located near the village of Alseda in Småland. Lillian, her parents and three brothers sailed from Boston aboard the Cunard Line&#x27;s &quot;Ivernia&quot; and arrived in Liverpool on July 4, from where they proceeded to Gothenburg before arriving at Alseda. The family remained at Alseda for over four years while settling matters with the farm and caring for Lillian&#x27;s grandmother, during which time Selma gave birth to another son, Felix, in March 1909. Lillian&#x27;s mother would have rather stayed in Sweden, but her father said the children would get a better education back in America and booked passage for his family on the new White Star Line&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Aboard &quot;Titanic&quot;==

Lillian, her parents, and four brothers boarded &quot;Titanic&quot; at Southampton, England, United Kingdom, on April 10, 1912, as third-class passengers. Lillian was five years old at the time and recalled that the ship &quot;was very big, and it had just been painted. I remember not liking the smell of fresh paint.&quot;

Selma Asplund recalled that when &quot;Titanic&quot; struck an iceberg at 11:40 pm on the night of April 14, 1912, the family got to the first class promenade window where Lillian and Felix were loaded into descending lifeboat no. 10 by their father. Despite her mother&#x27;s wishes to remain with her husband, she eventually was thrown in the boat; Lillian later recalled, &quot;My mother said she would rather stay with him [my father] and go down with the ship. But he said the children should not be alone. She [my mother] got a seat. She had Felix on her lap, and she had me between her knees. I think she thought she could keep me a little warmer that way.&quot; Because the boat was nearly full and there was no more room for the other boys, Carl Asplund told his wife, &quot;Go ahead, we will get into one of the other boats.&quot; Lillian was haunted by the memory of seeing her father and brothers standing at the rail and seeing her father lead her brothers away, presumably to find another lifeboat. She later said that the ship sinking &quot;looked like a big building going down.&quot;

Lillian&#x27;s father, Carl, and her three brothers, Filip, Clarence and Carl Edgar, all died in the sinking. Lillian, her mother and brother were rescued by , which had arrived at the scene shortly after four o&#x27;clock in the morning. Lillian and her brother were loaded into burlap bags and hoisted to the ship&#x27;s deck. Aboard the &quot;Carpathia&quot;, Lillian remembered:
A woman took all my clothes off me. My clothes had gotten very dirty and wet in the lifeboat. My mother was trying to find me. She was saying, &#x27;I have a daughter!&#x27; Well, she found me. And eventually my clothes were dry, and I put them back on. They took us, the children, to the place where they take people who are sick. Well, not sick, but people who needed a little more attention. The people on the &quot;Carpathia&quot; were very good to us.&quot;

&quot;Carpathia&quot; arrived in New York City on April 18. Lillian&#x27;s mother took her and her brother to Worcester shortly thereafter.

In the confusion after the disaster, a Worcester newspaper reported that both Mr. and Mrs. Asplund had been saved, along with Clarence, Lillian and Felix, and that Filip and Carl had drowned. A later report said that Mrs. Asplund and her &quot;two babies&quot; had been taken to a local hospital, and that Mr. Asplund and Clarence were apparently at another location. A final report confirmed that neither Lillian&#x27;s father nor Clarence were among the survivors. Mr. Asplund&#x27;s body was recovered by CS &quot;Mackay-Bennett&quot;. On his corpse was his watch, its hands frozen at 2:19 am, one minute before the ship went down entirely. He was later buried in All Faiths Cemetery in Worcester. As the family&#x27;s savings and possessions were lost in the disaster, a fundraiser and benefit was held by the city of Worcester which brought in $2,000 ().

==Later life==

Lillian&#x27;s mother never recovered from the loss of her husband and three eldest sons and refused to discuss the disaster with anyone, saying that it was simply wrong to do so. Lillian agreed and, for the rest of her life, hardly ever spoke of the disaster. According to her lawyer, when asked about why she refused interviews even when offered money, Lillian stated: &quot;Why do I want money from the &quot;Titanic&quot;? Look what I lost. A father and three brothers.&quot;

Lillian worked secretarial jobs in the Worcester area and retired early to care for her mother. Mrs. Asplund died on April 15, 1964, the 52nd anniversary of the sinking, at the age of 90. Her brother Felix, who never married and with whom Lillian lived, died of pneumonia on March 15, 1983, at the age of 73.

==Death==

Lillian died in her home in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, on May 6, 2006, at the age of 99. She was buried at the Old Swedish Cemetery in Worcester, alongside her father, mother, and brother. Her death left Barbara West and Millvina Dean as the last two living survivors of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. However, as both women were less than a year old at the time, neither had any recollection of the sinking. With Lillian being the last survivor who remembered the disaster, first-hand accounts of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; passed into history upon her death.

After Lillian&#x27;s death, the steamship ticket she had held for so many years was sold at auction in 2009. It was a part of documents and items that were posthumously found in a safety deposit box that were connected to the disaster, such as her father&#x27;s pocket watch that stopped at 2:19 am.

<text>.dk is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Denmark. The supervision of the .dk top-level domain is handled exclusively by Punktum dk. Any new .dk domain name has to be applied for via an approved registrar. Then the domain name applicant can ask the registrar to manage their domain name or have it managed directly by the Punktum dk. Registrations of domain names with the characters æ, ø, å, ö, ä, ü, é, and ẞ are also allowed.

==History==
The country code top-level domain .dk was created July 14, 1987, at ARPA Network Information Center, Stanford Research Institute (SRI-NIC). The Danish UNIX User Group (DKUUG) at Datalogisk Institut, Københavns Universitet (DIKU) received management of the .dk domain on the DKnet, at that time an informal name used for the UUCP network used at DIKU and other places in Denmark. The name DKnet has been in use since at least 1985.

In mid-1988 DKnet was connected to the emerging DENet, the government-sponsored research network established in late 1987 now known as forskningsnettet, run and maintained by UNI-C.

In November 1987 DKUUG made a name agreement (&quot;navneaftalen&quot;) with the coordinators of the three other networks then working in Denmark, a national experimental X.400 net (EAN from University of British Columbia), EARN and DECnet, concerning the .dk domain. They agreed to share it, hiding from the users which network they were connected to, and nullifying the use of pseudo-domains like .uucp or second-level domains like gov.uk, thereby creating a practice that has been enforced ever since, and also applied in other countries.

By early 1992 UNI-C via DENet (an acronym for &quot;Danish Educational Network&quot;) serviced all the Universities in Denmark, and DIKU had no need for DKnet anymore. Thus DKUUG, with DKnet, moved to Symbion Science Park where they received their own international lines and started to lease these to companies, and modem connections to private consumers. The growing business quickly overshadowed the organization&#x27;s own economy, forcing the creation of a separate company. In 1993, DKnet ApS, a genuine ISP and Denmark&#x27;s first, was established as a limited liability company (ApS).

In 1996, with the establishment of the Danish Research Network, the name &quot;DENet&quot; was used for the commercial part of the network and changed to be an acronym for &quot;Dansk Erhvervs Net&quot;, i.e. Danish Business Network.

===Tele Danmark takes over===
On February 15, 1996, DKnet ApS, including the .dk domain management, was sold by DKUUG to Tele Danmark (now TDC) at the price of 20 million DKK. Acknowledging the possible conflict of interest of a company (Tele Denmark) behind both a commercial ISP (DKnet A/S, now a stock company) and also in control of the .dk domain management (Punktum dk), a group of tele- and internet companies, 28 in all, including TeliaSonera, Global One, Deutsche Telekom, IBM, assembled five days after the purchase in order to gain control of the Punktum dk function.

Tele Danmark initially refused, and the group together formed the organisation Foreningen af Internetleverandører (FIL), and threatened to go directly to IANA to counter what they saw as a bona fide Tele Danmark monopoly. Tele Denmark agreed and FIL became the authority registered by IANA for the .dk domain, while the nominal and practical administration remained the responsibility of DKnet A/S. In June 1996 they signed a one-year contract about the practice and rules concerning the .dk domain, which would later be renewed for another year.

===Race for the .dk domain===
On January 15, 1997, at 15:00, FIL loosened the restrictions for registering a .dk domain name. Where one had previously needed a valid reason to register one, all restrictions were now removed, creating an unprecedented run on .dk domain names. By the end of 1996 there were only 6,500 registered .dk domains, by February 1, 1997, this had more than doubled and at the end of 1997 there were 41,000 registered .dk domains. This in turn created a series of legal actions, which would last well into the 2000s, not only against FIL&#x27;s own members, who were accused of using inside knowledge to register large numbers of &quot;good&quot; domain names quickly, but also against individuals who were accused of cyber squatting.

In December 1997 Tele Danmark announced that from the beginning of 1998 they would start collecting a yearly fee (of 340 DKK excluding VAT) for every registered domain name via Punktum dk. This caused a stir in FIL&#x27;s members, as they had not been informed. While there had been talks about some sort of fee to Punktum dk to cover its expenses, no review of Punktum dk&#x27;s actual budget was available since it was financially all but a part of Tele Danmark. This was therefore seen by FIL as abuse of power and profit making via the supposedly non-profit Punktum dk organization. It was later revealed that it was the board of directors of FIL (later fired) that had granted Tele Danmark the right to set the price that they wanted, without asking its members.

As a consequence of this, Tele Danmark announced in March 1998 that the commercial parts in DKnet A/S would be moved to Tele Denmark Internet and DKnet A/S, with its only remaining asset, Punktum dk, would be renamed to &quot;Punktum dk A/S&quot;, and put up for sale. Tele Danmark encouraged a larger forum or group comprising more than just telecom and internet companies (like FIL) to form and buy it, because the Internet now had a much broader appeal. This caused yet another stir in FIL who flat-out rejected that Tele Denmark had the right to sell something it did not own.

===DIFO takes over===
In October 1998 FIL sent a letter to Tele Danmark ending the contract and agreement that had been signed back in June 1996 (renewed in 1997). The letter also stated that FIL wanted to take over the running of Punktum dk themselves. Tele Danmark denied that FIL could do this. In November 1998 FIL, on the invitation of the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, called a meeting between all actors on the Danish internet, companies as well as users, under the banner &quot;ID MoU&quot; (&quot;Internet Danmark Memorandum of Understanding&quot;) in order to establish a long-term agreement on the administration of the .dk domain.
The result of &quot;ID MoU&quot; was that a number of institutions and organizations established a self-owning institution named Dansk INTERNET Forum (DIFO) on July 1, 1999, which with the help of external investment bought &quot;Punktum dk A/S&quot; in December 1999.

===IPv6===
Punktum dk has offered IPv6 glue records for second-level domains since April 4, 2008, when the first DNS provider had IPv6 glue records added in the TLD. IPv6 was enabled at the transport layer to TLD nameservers a few years prior to that. Just days prior to the World IPv6 day, Punktum dk added an IPv6 address in DNS for their web server and that of the web server of its owner, DIFO.

===DNSSEC===
After the DNS root zone was signed in mid-July 2010, the .DK-zone was officially signed using NSEC3 on July 23, 2010, and the root zone was updated July 26, 2010, to include the corresponding DS-record. Since August 1, 2010, customers&#x27; DS-records have been included in the DK-zone.

==Second level domains==
In general most companies and people register their desired domain name at the second level, e.g. company.dk and lastname.dk.

==Third level domains==
Third level domains are allocated by second level domain owners. The registry does not run, recommend nor endorse any general second level domains, such as .com.dk, for third parties, and they are generally not seen.

==Oldest .dk domains==
The oldest .dk domains still registered in Punktum dk&#x27;s database, are the domains dkuug.dk, diku.dk, bk.dk, ibt.dk, ifad.dk, lego.dk, mainz.dk and nordita.dk which were all registered in 1987 when .dk was registered. With the registration of .dk a dual naming with both .uucp and .dk names was introduced. Of these, diku.dk and ibt.dk can be said to be the oldest names, as these were the initial names on the Danish UUCP network started 2 January 1983.

==New name==
In April 2023, DK Hostmaster changed its name to Punktum dk.

<text>.dm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Commonwealth of Dominica in the eastern Caribbean. Registrants of a second-level .dm domain get the corresponding third-level names within .com.dm, .net.dm and .org.dm automatically included. There are no restrictions on who can register these names, but they are not very heavily used.

One example of a &quot;.dm&quot; web property is a URL shortener, play.dm, used exclusively by Playdom, which is an example of domain hacking.

==History==

The .fo domain was operated by UNI-C, the Danish University Network organisation until June 1997. It then passed under the control of Tele2 DK, who had bought the activities of UNI-C as part of a privatisation.

In July 1998, the operation was handed to nic.fo as a gesture of good will, and recognition that .fo was indeed Faroese.

<doc id="1111930" wikidata="Q12860064" url="?curid=1111930" title="Valley Forge National Historical Park">
<text>Valley Forge National Historical Parkis the site of the third winter encampment of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War from December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778. The National Park Service preserves the site and interprets the history of the Valley Forge encampment. The park contains historical buildings, recreated encampment structures, memorials, museums, and recreation facilities.

The park occupies and is visited by nearly 2 million people each year. There are restored historic structures, reconstructed structures such as the iconic log huts, and monuments erected by the states from which the Continental soldiers came. There is a museum with exhibits of original artifacts. The park also provides over of hiking and biking trails, which are connected to the regional trails system. 

==Historical encampment==

Approximately 12,000 Continental Army troops under George Washington&#x27;s command were encamped at Valley Forge from December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778. After British General Howe captured the American capitol of Philadelphia, Washington chose the site for the encampment because it was between the British and the Second Continental Congress in York, as well as supply depots in Reading. At the same time, Valley Forge was far enough from Philadelphia to make a British surprise attack unlikely, but close enough that Continental forces could scout enemy positions and prevent them from foraging the countryside.

The Valley Forge encampment was one of the most trying moments for the Continental Army during the war, but they also used the encampment to retrain and rejuvenate. The shared hardship of the officers and soldiers of the Continental Army and the professional military training provided by Baron Friedrich von Steuben are considered a turning point in the Revolutionary War, which secured the independence of the Thirteen Colonies and the establishment of the United States.

==Park history==
The Centennial and Memorial Association of Valley Forge was incorporated in 1878 with the purpose of saving, acquiring, and preserving General Washington&#x27;s Headquarters and surrounding acreage. A large Centennial event was held on June 19, 1878, the 100th anniversary of Washington&#x27;s Army exiting Valley Forge.

Valley Forge was established as the first state park of Pennsylvania in 1893 by the Valley Forge Park Commission (VFPC) &quot;to preserve, improve, and maintain as a public park the site on which General George Washington&#x27;s army encamped at Valley Forge.&quot; The area around Washington&#x27;s headquarters was chosen as the park site. In 1923, the VFPC was brought under the Department of Forests and Waters, then incorporated into the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1971.

Valley Forge was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1961 and was listed in the initial National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The area covered by these listings goes outside what was then Valley Forge State Park boundaries to include four historic houses where the Marquis de Lafayette and other officers were quartered.

In 1976, Pennsylvania gave the park as a gift to the nation for the United States Bicentennial. Congress passed a law, signed by President Gerald Ford on July 4, 1976, authorizing the addition of Valley Forge National Historical Park as the 283rd Unit of the National Park System and allocating a budget for essential facilities.

==Features and facilities==
===Washington&#x27;s Headquarters===

A key attraction of the park is the restored colonial home used by General George Washington as his headquarters during the encampment. Rehabilitation of the headquarters area was completed in summer 2009 and included the restoration of the old Valley Forge Train Station into an information center, new guided tours, new exhibits throughout the landscape, and the elimination of several acres of modern paving and restoration of the historic landscape. Quarters of other Continental Army generals are also in the park, including those of Generals Varnum, Lord Stirling, Lafayette, and Knox.

===Reconstructed works and buildings===
Throughout the park there are reconstructed log cabins of the type thought to be used during the encampment. Earthworks are visible for the defense of the encampment, including four redoubts, the ditch for the Inner Line Defenses, and a reconstructed abatis.

===Washington Memorial Chapel===
The Washington Memorial Chapel, an inholding of the park, and National Patriots Bell Tower carillon sit atop a hill at the center of the park. The chapel is a functioning Episcopal Church, built as a tribute to Washington. The bell tower houses the Daughters of the American Revolution Patriot Rolls, listing those who served in the Revolutionary War.

===Memorial markers===

The &quot;National Memorial Arch&quot; dominates the southern portion of the park and is dedicated &quot;to the officers and private soldiers of the Continental Army December 19, 1777 – June 19, 1778&quot;. It was commissioned by Congress in 1910 and completed in 1917. It is inscribed with George Washington&#x27;s tribute to the perseverance and endurance of his army:

The drive is lined with large memorial stones for each of the brigades that encamped there. Crossing Gulph Road at the arch, the drive proceeds through the Pennsylvania Columns and past the hilltop statue of Anthony Wayne on a horse. More brigade markers line PA Route 23.

===Trails===
There are over of hiking, biking, and horseback riding trails within the park, such as the Valley Creek Trail and the River Trail. The main trail is the Joseph Plumb Martin Trail, which consists of a 5-mile (8 km) loop of the park. Portions of regional trails also run through the park, including the Horse Shoe Trail and the Schuylkill River Trail.

==Train station==
The Valley Forge Train Station is near Washington&#x27;s Headquarters. It was completed in 1911 by the Reading Railroad and was the point of entry to the park for travelers who came by rail through the 1950s from Philadelphia, distant. The station was restored in 2009 and is used as a museum and information center that offers visitors a better understanding of Washington&#x27;s Headquarters and the village of Valley Forge. It is constructed of the same type of stone as Washington&#x27;s Headquarters.

==Modern problems==
A tract of land within the park boundaries was purchased by Toll Brothers in 2002, a real estate development company, for $3.15 million. In 2004, development plans ended after the National Park Service bought it from Toll for $7.5 million.

In 2007, the non-profit American Revolution Center purchased of land within the park boundary with plans to construct a conference center, hotel, retail, campground, and museum on the site. The National Parks Conservation Association and local citizens sued Lower Providence Township over the zoning change that enabled this proposal. The two parties agreed to allow the NPS to keep the land, and in exchange, the American Revolution Center was given property in Philadelphia, where it built the Museum of the American Revolution.

An overpopulation of white-tailed deer has resulted in &quot;changes in the species composition, abundance, and distribution of native plant communities and associated wildlife&quot; in the park. In 2008, the National Park Service released a draft deer management plan and environmental impact statement for public review. The intent of the plan was to &quot;support long-term protection, preservation, and restoration of native vegetation and other natural resources within the park.&quot; Hunting is prohibited by the legislation that created the park, and action by Congress would be required before it could be sanctioned.

<doc id="1111946" wikidata="Q479179" url="?curid=1111946" title="May Queen">
<text>In the British Isles and parts of the Commonwealth, the May Queen or Queen of May is a personification of the May Day holiday of 1 May, and of springtime and the coming growing season. The May Queen is a girl who rides or walks at the front of a parade for May Day celebrations. She wears a white gown to symbolise purity and usually a tiara or crown. Her duty is to begin the May Day celebrations. She is generally crowned by flowers and makes a speech before the dancing begins. Certain age-groups dance around a Maypole celebrating youth and springtime.

==History==

In 1922 James George Frazer speculated that the figure of the May Queen was linked to ancient tree worship. 

In the High Middle Ages in England the May Queen was also known as the &quot;Summer Queen&quot;. George C. Homans points out: &quot;The time from Hocktide, after Easter Week, to Lammas (1 August) was summer (&quot;estas&quot;).&quot;

In 1557, a London diarist called Henry Machyn wrote:

&quot;The xxx day of May was a goly May-gam in Fanch-chyrchestrett with drumes and gunes and pykes, and ix wordes dyd ryd; and thay had speches evere man, and the morris dansse and the sauden, and an elevant with the castyll, and the sauden and yonge morens with targattes and darttes, and the lord and the lade of the Maye&quot;.

Modern English: On the 30 May was a jolly May-game in Fenchurch Street (London) with drums and guns and pikes, The Nine Worthies did ride; and they all had speeches, and the morris dance and sultan and an elephant with a castle and the sultan and young moors with shields and arrows, and the lord and lady of the May&quot;.

==Maintaining the tradition==

Many areas keep this tradition alive today. The town of Hayfield, Derbyshire, claims to have the oldest unbroken tradition based on a much older May Fair. Another notable event includes the one in the Brentham Garden Suburb, England, which hosts it annually. It has the second oldest unbroken tradition although the May Queen of All London Festival at Hayes Common in Bromley is a close contender having been in existence since 1912. A May Day festival is held on the village green at Aldborough, North Yorkshire on a site that dates back to Roman times and the settlement of Isurium Brigantum. A May queen is selected from a group of 13 upward girls by the young dancers. She returns the next year to crown the new May Queen and stays in the procession. The largest event in this tradition in modern Britain is the Beltane Fire Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland.

A May Day celebration held annually since 1870 in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, has the distinction of being the longest running May Day celebration of its kind in the British Commonwealth.

==Related personifications==

Male companions to the May Queen, sometimes associated with May Day customs in Great Britain, include personifications known as Father May, King of the May, May King, Garland King, Green Man, or Jack in the Green. As part of this folk custom, some villages would choose a man to act as consort for the May Queen. This man, the May King, would dress in greenery to symbolise springtime.

<doc id="1111950" wikidata="Q241353" url="?curid=1111950" title="Mongolia national football team">
<text>The Mongolia national football team (, &quot;Mongolyn khölbömbögiin ündesnii shigshee bag&quot;) represents Mongolia in international football and is controlled by the Mongolian Football Federation.

Founded in 1959, the association was inactive between 1960 and 1998 when the team did not feature in any international fixtures. The Mongolian Football Federation is a member of the Asian Football Confederation and the East Asian Football Federation. The team has never participated in the FIFA World Cup, and the only major international tournaments the team has taken part in are the 1998 Asian Games and 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup, not progressing past the group stage in either competition.

==History==

Mongolia&#x27;s first international fixture was a 12–0 loss to Japan during a match in Manchukuo in 1942. Between 1960 and 1998, the Mongolia team played no international matches before being accepted as a FIFA member in 1998. Mongolia&#x27;s first competitive matches were in the 1998 Asian Games qualifiers where they were heavily defeated by Kuwait 11–0, and by Uzbekistan 15–0. 

They entered qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but lost their opening five matches before drawing 2–2 with Bangladesh, securing a single point. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Mongolia was drawn against the Maldives and though they remained competitive after the first leg, only losing 1–0 at home, they were crushed in the second leg in Malé 12–0 and eliminated. In the first round of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Mongolia was beaten 9–2 on aggregate by North Korea, and four years later in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Mongolia lost to Myanmar 2–1. Mongolia then lost in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers to Timor-Leste; however, they were later awarded two 3–0 victories as Timor-Leste had fielded numerous ineligible players. This came after the second round matches had been played; therefore, Mongolia did not advance in the competition.

According to the voting outcome at the AFC Congress held in January 2011, the Mongolian Football Federation was suspended to conduct any activities at the EAFF until the EAFF Ordinary Congress of March 2014. They were welcomed back to the federation at the 7th Ordinary Congress and 41st and 42nd Executive Committee Meeting of the EAFF.

For Mongolia, their next tournament was the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup, a tournament for the confederation&#x27;s lowest ranked teams who have limited opportunities to arrange friendly matches, in November 2016. The tournament would replace the defunct AFC Challenge Cup. Being drawn in Group B alongside Sri Lanka, Macau, and Laos, Mongolia finished third in the group with a loss to Laos in the final match-day ending their chances of qualifying through to the semi-finals.

Mongolia then hosted their first international with the EAFF Annual Meeting advising that Mongolia would host the Round 1 of qualification for the East Asian Football Championship After comfortable wins in its first two matches, Mongolia needed only a single point against Guam on the final matchday to secure a place in the second round of the tournament for the first time ever. After a scoreless first half, Guam took the lead in the 89th minute. However, in the fourth minute of stoppage time a Norjmoo Tsedenbal strike rescued a point for Mongolia which was enough for the team to earn the top spot in the group and advance. Mongolia&#x27;s 9–0 result over the Northern Mariana Islands set the current team record for largest margin of victory

Mongolia succeeded in qualifying past the first round for the first time in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers by beating Brunei 3–2 over two legs. In the second round, following a 14–0 defeat to Japan on 30 March 2021, they let head coach Rastislav Božik go and hired Shuichi Mase as their new head coach. In their next game on 7 June, Mongolia managed to shock Kyrgyzstan 1–0 for their first ever win against a Central Asian and a top-100 ranked opponent in a FIFA qualifier. This win meant that the national team competed in 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifying in the third-round where they only would get the one win against Yemen. In March 2023, Mongolia recorded its highest-ever FIFA ranking of 183rd.

== Team image ==
=== Nicknames ===
The Mongolian national team is often nicknamed the Blue Wolves. The blue wolf is a symbol of Turkic and Mongolian people, and originates from the Mongolian legend of the blue wolf. The team has also been known as the &quot;Shegshee&quot;, which translates as &quot;national team&quot; in Mongolian. 

=== Kits and crest ===
Currently, the Mongolian national football team uses an all-white uniform as their first colours, and a blue uniform as their second colours. In August 2021 it was announced that Mongolian sportswear company TG Sport had signed a two-year deal with the Mongolian Football Federation to provide kits for all Mongolian national teams.

Kelme is currently the official jerseys sponsor for the team from 2023

=== Home stadium ===
Mongolia plays their home matches at the MFF Football Centre, a 5,000 capacity stadium in Ulaanbaatar. The stadium boasts an artificial playing surface.

<text>.iq is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Iraq.

This domain was in limbo for several years, as the delegated manager was imprisoned in Texas on charges of alleged connections to Hamas (a State Department designated terrorist organization), for which he was later convicted in 2005. Some talk of redelegation and relaunching began taking place at the time of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and in 2005 a redelegation to the National Communications and Media Commission of Iraq was approved by ICANN.

Registrations are within these categories:
* .iq – general
* gov.iq – governmental entities
* edu.iq – higher education institutions
* sch.iq – public and private schools
* com.iq – commercial entities recognised by the Ministry of Trade and/or other relevant authorities
* mil.iq – military institutions
* org.iq – non-profit organizations
* net.iq – network service providers recognised by the Ministry of Trade
* name.iq – individuals

<text>.tw is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan after the country left the United Nations in 1971. The domain name is based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code TW. The registry is maintained by the (TWNIC), a Taiwanese non-profit organization appointed by the National Communications Commission (NCC) and the Ministry of Transportation and Communication. Since 1 March 2001, TWNIC has stopped allowing itself to sign up new domain names directly, instead allowing new registration through its contracted reseller registrars. , there are 17 registrars.

==Second-level domains==
Registrations under are possible in second-level space or under various domains as third-level domains:

* : for educational and academic institutions
* : for agencies of the Government of the Republic of China
* : for the Republic of China Armed Forces
* : for companies or firms
* : for network or telecommunications license holders
* : for non-profit organizations
* : for individuals (must verify their identity by e-mail)
* : unrestricted (but registrant must verify their identity by email), intended for gaming-related content
* : unrestricted (but registrant must verify their identity by email), intended for online business-related content
* : unrestricted (but registrant must verify their identity by email)
* : unrestricted

Domain names in Chinese characters may also be registered at the second level. Furthermore, any registrant of a standard domain name who has chosen a domestic registrar may automatically get two more domain names in Chinese characters in the following second-level domains: .tw, .tw and .tw. These second-level domains correspond to , and , respectively.

== Statistics ==

As of March 2017, around 8.31％ of the .tw domains are served via secured HTTPS protocol, with the cPanel, Inc. Certification Authority being the most popular SSL certificate. Apache is the most popular web server, serving 47.60% of the .tw domains, followed by Microsoft-IIS serving 20.31% of the total .tw domains.

==Internationalized domains==
ICANN assigned two Internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLDs) for Taiwan on 25 June 2010:

* : &quot;Taiwan&quot; in traditional Chinese characters (DNS name: xn--kpry57d)
* : &quot;Taiwan&quot; in simplified Chinese characters (DNS name: xn--kprw13d)
Since at least November 2015, the simplified suffix is a DNAME alias for the traditional suffix. As a result, any subdomain of the traditional xn--kpry57d TLD automatically has a CNAME alias from the simplified xn--kprw13d TLD. The traditional suffix is in active use.

<doc id="1111973" wikidata="Q905693" url="?curid=1111973" title="Tanque Argentino Mediano">
<text>The Tanque Argentino Mediano (TAM; English: &quot;Argentine Medium Tank&quot;) is a light tank in service with the Argentine Army. Lacking the experience and resources to design a tank, the Argentine Ministry of Defense contracted German company Thyssen-Henschel. The vehicle was developed by a German and Argentine team of engineers, and was based on the German Marder infantry fighting vehicle chassis.

The TAM met the Argentine Army&#x27;s requirement for a modern, lightweight and fast tank with a low silhouette and sufficient firepower to defeat contemporary armored threats. Development began in 1974 and resulted in the construction of three prototypes by early 1977 and full-scale production by 1979. Assembly took place at the local TAMSE plant, founded for the purpose by the Argentine government. Economic difficulties halted production in 1983, but manufacturing began anew in 1994 until the army&#x27;s order of 200 tanks was fulfilled.

The TAM series includes seven different variants, such as a self-propelled howitzer and a mortar carrier vehicle. In total, over 280 such vehicles were built, including armored personnel carriers, artillery and mortar pieces. The TAM and VCTP (Infantry Fighting Vehicles based on the TAM chassis) were manufactured for the Peruvian Army, only to be integrated into the Argentine Army when Peru canceled the contract. The TAM also competed for other export orders, but the TAM was ultimately not exported.

The TAM has never seen combat, although 17 VCTPs were deployed to Croatia for the United Nations UNPROFOR peacekeeping mission.

==Development==

During the 1960s Argentina sought to replace its aging fleet of tanks, which included British Sherman V Firefly tanks and American M3A1 half-tracks dating from shortly after the Second World War. In their attempts to procure equipment from the United States, Argentina could only secure 50 M41 Walker Bulldogs (undelivered) and 250 M113 armored personnel carriers. When the United States turned down requests for further equipment, the Argentine government turned to the other side of the Atlantic, putting their &quot;Plan Europa&quot; (Plan Europe) into action. It was hoped that European technology could stimulate Argentine industry so the country could produce its own armaments in the future. Argentina procured 80 AMX-13 light tanks, as well as 180 AMX-VCIs and 24 AMX-155 F3s, from the French government, manufacturing around 40 AMX-13s and 60 AMX-VCIs at home. The French AMX-30 and German Leopard 1 were also examined as possible replacements for the Argentine Sherman fleet.

In 1973 the Argentine Ministry of Defense drew up a series of requirements for a tank to enter service in the 1980s. The armored vehicle would weigh no more than , move at a maximum speed of , and cover at least on roads. It would be armed with a modern 105 mm main gun, two machine guns, and grenade launchers. The tank designers also had to take into account Argentina&#x27;s existing infrastructure, including railroad capacity, bridges and road capacity, as well as the country&#x27;s varied terrain. In late 1973 the &quot;Proyecto de Tanque Argentino Mediano&quot; (Argentine Medium Tank Project) was founded with the goal of designing and developing a tank for the Argentine Army. Lacking the experience and the necessary technology, the Argentine government sought collaboration with a foreign company, resulting in a contract with the German company Thyssen-Henschel. The contract called for a transfer of technology resulting in a program to develop a tank in line with the government&#x27;s requirements and under a technical team that included both German and Argentine engineers. The hull of the German Marder armored personnel carrier was used, and the chassis was strengthened to support the increased weight of the TAM. Two prototypes were manufactured in late 1976 and early 1977, which were put through extensive testing for two years and over a road range of . Simultaneously, another prototype was manufactured to further the investigation of the new vehicle and complete the three prototypes as agreed in the contract.

The new tank&#x27;s firepower requirements were met by fitting a British Royal Ordnance L7A1 main gun. This gun was later replaced by the modified L7A2 and finally by Rheinmetall&#x27;s Rh-105-30 gun. This gun is manufactured in Argentina as the FM K.4 &quot;Modelo&quot; 1L. The Rh-105-30&#x27;s advantages include low weight, compact size and increased lethality. Unlike the Rh-105-30, the FM K.4 does not have a muzzle brake. The locally built cannon can be elevated to 18 degrees or depressed to -7 degrees on the TAM. The gun&#x27;s hydraulic recoil mechanism has an extended length of to absorb the recoil force. It is designed to fire the M735A1 armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot, which can penetrate a maximum of at . It can also fire high-explosive anti-tank rounds, high-explosive squash head and smoke rounds. The tank&#x27;s secondary armaments include a co-axial FN MAG 60-40 general purpose machine gun and a second FN MAG 60-20 mounted on the TAM&#x27;s turret roof as an anti-aircraft machine gun. The fire control system includes a with a range of and a FLER-HG ballistic computer to compute the gun&#x27;s fire solutions—helping the gunner aim and hit the target. The tank commander uses a Zeiss PERI-R/TA panoramic periscope, with a 2x and 8x zoom.

The TAM&#x27;s engine requirements included low weight and volume, but with a fast rate of acceleration and high reliability. The program chose MTU&#x27;s MB-833 Ka 500 diesel engine, producing at 2,400 rpm. This gives the TAM a power-to-weight ratio of 24 horsepower per tonne and a maximum speed of on road and off-road. With a internal fuel tank, the TAM can travel . Its range is extended to if the vehicle is equipped with two external fuel tanks. The TAM&#x27;s transmission is a Renk HSWL-204 automatic, with a hydrodynamic torque converter. A double brake system includes hydraulic disk brakes on the roadwheels, and the suspension is a torsion bar.

The TAM&#x27;s survivability is related to its low profile turret, based on that of the Leopard 1A4s and the Leopard 2, and its physical armor array. It has at 75 degrees on the glacis plate and 32 degrees on the vehicle&#x27;s sides. This offers protection against anti-armor shells from up to guns. The turret front is protected by of steel armor at an angle of 32 degrees. Although the tank&#x27;s weight and armor protection are light compared to other main battle tanks, it has the advantage of better tactical mobility over the nation&#x27;s terrain.

As a private venture, Thyssen-Henschel built a fourth prototype designated TH 301. Completed in 1978, it added a PERI R12 periscope, originally designed for the Leopard 1A4, for the tank commander. The gunner and loader each received a day periscope as well. To enable the crew to fire effectively at night, a low light level television (LLLTV) camera, which moved in elevation with the main gun, was fitted to the mantlet. Furthermore, the tank received a more powerful engine. The improvement program also made provisions to increase the thickness of the armor for additional protection.

Production began in 1979, with the intent to build a total of 512 armored vehicles (200 tanks and 312 VCTP infantry fighting vehicles). Economic problems, however, ended production in 1983 with only 150 TAMs and 100 VCTPs built. These vehicles were produced by an Argentine company, &quot;Tanque Argentino Mediano Sociedad del Estado&quot; (or TAMSE) founded by the government in March 1980. 70% of the TAM&#x27;s components were manufactured in Argentina, while the 30% manufactured in Germany corresponded to the transmission, optics and fire control system. In 1983, 20 TAMs and 26 VCTPs were delivered to the Argentine Army after an original order of 80 TAMs by Peru was canceled due to budgetary issues. In 1991, TAMSE and the TAM production line were shut down, although in 1994 TAMSE was reactivated to complete an order for 120 of both TAMs and VCTPs to replace the M4 Shermans in the 2nd Armored Cavalry Brigade of the Argentine Army. By 1995 the Argentine Army was equipped with 200 TAM tanks and 216 VCTP and VCPC armored vehicles. Although 25 VCA-155s were originally planned for production starting in 1990, only 19 were completed and delivered by 1995, along with 50 VCTMs. No other variants of the TAM, including the VCLC, VAC and VCRT were put into production due to budget restrictions.

The TAMSE plant is a facility. The factory is completely covered, with two warehouses for storing components, quality control laboratories, a project office, an engine test room and a firing range. Also participating in the production of TAM and variant components were Argentine companies Military Factories General San Martín (manufacturing the chassis), Río Tercero (turret and armament) and Bator Cocchis, S.A.

== Export and operational history ==
The TAM vehicle family has never seen combat, although it has been deployed on peacekeeping operations. A number of countries have considered acquiring the vehicles, although none have ever been exported. 

In 1981, even before the TAM entered service with Argentina, Malaysia signed a contract with the TAMSE company for 102 vehicles, comprising the TAM and its VCTP and VCRT derivatives, which would have been known in Malaysian service as the Lion, Tiger and Elephant, respectively. For a variety of factors, none of these vehicles could be delivered aa scheduled and the order was cancelled. (Malaysia chose instead to procure Poland&#x27;s PT-91.)

The TAM had not entered service in Argentina when the Malvinas/Falklands War of 1982 began. The Argentine Army did not deploy its existing AMX-13 tanks, deeming them unsuited to the boggy off-road conditions in the Malvinas Islands. Panhard AML armoured cars were deployed, for on-road fire support.

In mid-1983, Peru placed a contract for 80 TAMs. Due to budgetary problems the order was canceled after 20 tanks had been completed. A similar order was established by Panama in 1984, and was canceled as well. In 1989 the TAM competed in a tank procurement order from Ecuador, alongside the US Stingray light tank, the Austrian SK-105 Kürassier and the French AMX-13. The TAM achieved 950 out of 1,000 points, while its closest competitor earned 750 points, but in the end Ecuador did not procure any of the vehicles presented.

In the Middle East, both Saudi Arabia and Iran expressed interest in the TAM. The Saudi Arabian deal was scrapped after Israel successfully appealed to Germany to block the use of its technology. The Iranian deal also fell through after both Iraq and Saudi Arabia appealed to Germany. TAMSE subsequently attempted to sell 60 already completed vehicles to Iran, using a Panamanian company, Agrometal, as an intermediary – the company was to receive a 10% commission. After TAMSE reduced the price of the vehicles, the Iranian government lost confidence in the deal and canceled it.

During the 1990s, an Argentine battalion deployed to Yugoslavia as part of United Nations peacekeeping operations was accompanied by 17 VCTPs. 

In 1995, with no further export orders likely, the Argentine government permanently halted production and the factory was closed.

==Variants==
A number of variants were built on the same chassis as the TAM tank. The original program called for the design of an infantry fighting vehicle, and in 1977 the program finished manufacturing the prototype of the &quot;Vehículo de Combate Transporte de Personal&quot; (Personnel Transport Combat Vehicle), or VCTP. The VCTP is able to transport a squad of 12 men, including the squad leader and nine riflemen. The squad leader is situated in the turret of the vehicle; one rifleman sits behind him and another six are seated in the chassis, the eighth manning the hull machine gun and the ninth situated in the turret with the gunner. All personnel can fire their weapons from inside the vehicle, and the VCTP&#x27;s turret is armed with Rheinmetall&#x27;s Rh-202 autocannon. The VCTP holds 880 rounds for the autocannon, including subcaliber armor-piercing DM63 rounds. It is also armed with a 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun mounted on the turret roof. Infantry can dismount through a door on the rear of the hull. The commander has a day sight and seven observation periscopes, while the gunner has a day sight and three observation periscopes.

Variants also include the &quot;Vehículo de Combate de Artillería de 155 mm&quot; (155 mm Artillery Combat Vehicle), or VCA 155, and the &quot;Vehículo de Combate Transporte de Mortero&quot; (Mortar Transport Combat Vehicle), or VCTM. The VCA-155 is an elongated TAM chassis fitted with Oto Melara&#x27;s Palmaria self-propelled howitzer turret. It carries 28 projectiles, 23 of which are stored in the turret bustle. The VCTM carries an AM-50 internal mortar, which has a range of and a rate of fire of 8 to 12 shots per minute. Based on the TAM chassis, the &quot;Vehículo de Combate Puesto de Mando&quot; (command combat vehicle), or VCPC, is another variant designed in 1982. The &quot;Vehículo de Combate Lanzacohetes&quot; (Rocket launcher combat vehicle), or VCLC, designed in 1986, is also based on the TAM chassis and can be fitted with both and rockets. A combat ambulance, &quot;Vehículo de Combate Ambulancia&quot; (VCA), and an armored recovery vehicle, &quot;Vehículo de Combate de Recuperación&quot; (VCRT) are other combat variants of the tank.
=== TAM S 21 ===
In 2002, a program for a modernised TAM &#x27;for the 21st century&#x27; began. This program sought, above all, to modernise the fire control system and other electronic systems. The TAM S 21 was equipped with an Israeli thermal sight, allowing the vehicle to better perform at night or in adverse weather conditions. The vehicle also saw the addition of a GPS, as well as extended battery performance. 20 upgraded vehicles were planned, but only 6 vehicles had been built before the project was cancelled.

=== TAM 2C ===
In 2010, a modernization program was announced. Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems was chosen to provide 3-axis gyro-stabilization. The first TAM unit upgraded by Elbit Systems was delivered in March 2013. The TAM 2C was upgraded with many features, mainly revolving around electronics and other secondary features. The upgrades included a thermal imager for the gunner and commander, a thermal sleeve for the barrel, and an auxiliary power unit to provide power to critical systems when the main engine is off and reduce fuel consumption while idling. The TAM 2C also had numerous firepower upgrades, including new APFSDS shells and a new HEAT shell, and the capability to fire LAHAT anti-tank guided missiles, with over 800 mm of penetration and 8 km range. It is not known whether or not the Argentinian government will purchase such missiles. The TAM 2C also received a new turret storage basket.

=== TAM 2IP ===

In 2016, Elbit Systems unveiled a new prototype variant of the TAM, called the TAM 2IP (Improved Protection). While the TAM 2IP lacked the upgraded FCS and optics as seen on the previous TAM 2C, the tank was upgraded with new passive composite armour, across the front and sides of the turret and the front hull. This armour was based on the IMI Iron Wall design.

=== TAM 2C-A2 ===
The TAM 2C-A2 is a further prototype of the TAM 2C unveiled in May 2023, currently undergoing testing by the Argentine Army. It integrates upgraded electronics and optics to the ones present on the 2C. The gunner&#x27;s sight has been replaced by a system similar to the COAPS (Commander Open Architecture Panoramic Sight) from Elbit Systems, featuring day and night sights, greater ease for long-distance target acquisition, improved sensors and thermal sights, amongst others. The 2C-A2 also adds a hunter-killer system for the commander, allowing them to automatically track targets independently of the gunner. 74 TAM and TAM 2C vehicles are expected to be upgraded to the TAM 2C-A2 within a period of 7 years (to 2030).

*IBM System/390 was replaced by the 64-bit IBM eServer zSeries, z for Zero downtime.

The RS/6000 SP supercomputer line was replaced by Blue Gene platform.

== Discontinuation ==
In 2005, IBM announced a new brand, IBM System, as an umbrella for all IBM server and storage brands. The rebranding was completed in 2006 when the IBM xSeries became the IBM System x (later the Lenovo System x).
*IBM eServer zSeries became IBM System z
*IBM eServer pSeries became IBM System p
*IBM eServer iSeries became IBM System i
*IBM eServer xSeries became IBM System x (later Lenovo System x)

<doc id="1111982" wikidata="Q746636" url="?curid=1111982" title="Vancouver Island marmot">
<text>The Vancouver Island marmot (&quot;Marmota vancouverensis&quot;) is a species of marmot endemic to Vancouver Island, in British Columbia. It is one of only five land mammals endemic to Canada.

==Distribution== 
&quot;M. vancouverensis&quot; lives above 1000 metres elevation in meadows that face south to west, and habitat scarceness is believed to be the primary reason for its rarity.

Marmot surveys have been conducted on Vancouver Island since 1979. Beginning in the 1980s, this species experienced an 80% to 90% decline in population, such that by 2006 only 32 adults remained in the wild. Since that time, the population has begun to increase as a result of an ongoing program to restore wild populations of this unique Canadian species. As of the fall of 2021, there were just over 250 wild marmots living in 25 colonies distributed between two metapopulations, and one isolated colony at Steamboat Mountain.

==Description==

&quot;M. vancouverensis&quot; is typical of marmots in phenotype. It can however be distinguished from other marmots by its chocolate brown fur and contrasting white patches. The only species of marmot endemic to Vancouver Island, it apparently evolved rapidly since the retreat of the Cordilleran ice sheet some 10,000 years ago. It is distinct from other marmot species in terms of morphology, genetics, behaviour, and ecology.

An adult Vancouver Island marmot typically measures 65 to 70 centimetres from the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail. However, weights show tremendous seasonal variation. An adult female that weighs 3 kilograms when she emerges from hibernation in late April can weigh 4.5 to 5.5 kg by the onset of hibernation in late September or October. Adult males can be even larger, reaching weights of over 7.5 kg. In general, marmots lose about one-third of their body mass during the six-and-a-half months in which they hibernate during winter.

==Behaviour==
Like all marmots, the Vancouver Island marmot is exclusively herbivorous. Over 30 varieties of plants have been observed being consumed by marmots on Vancouver Island, who typically switch from grasses in the early spring to plants like lupines in the late summer. Marmots hibernate for various amounts of time depending upon site characteristics and weather conditions. Wild Vancouver Island marmots hibernate, on average, for about 210 days of the year, generally from late September or early October until late April or early May. They generally hibernate for shorter periods in captivity.

Vancouver Island marmots typically first breed at three or four years of age, although some have been observed to breed as two-year-olds. Male marmots have been noticed to mate with 2 or more females during mating season. Marmots breed soon after emergence from hibernation. Gestation is thought to be approximately 30–35 days. Litter sizes average 1–6 pups every other year, and weaned pups generally emerge above ground for the first time in early July.

==Conservation status==
Causes of marmot population declines are numerous. Over the long term (i.e., periods involving thousands of years), climate changes have caused both increases and declines of open alpine habitat that constitute suitable marmot habitat. Over more recent time scales, population dynamics may have been influenced by short-term weather patterns and systematic changes in the landscape. In particular, forest clearcutting at low elevations likely altered dispersal patterns. Sub-adult marmots typically disperse from the subalpine meadows in which they were born. Dispersal involves traversing lowland conifer forests and valleys to other subalpine meadows. However, clearcutting has provided marmots with new open areas which constitute habitat. Unfortunately, rapid forest regeneration makes such man-made habitats unsuitable over a few years. One study concluded that clearcuts therefore act as a kind of population &quot;sink&quot; in which long-term reproduction and survival rates are reduced to the point of unsustainability One 2005 study concluded the main cause of recent decline to be predation &quot;associated with forestry and altered predator abundance and hunting patterns&quot;. This study also revealed seasonal variations in mortality rates, where the probability of death was low during hibernation, and high in August. Major predators upon Vancouver Island marmots include golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), cougars (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) and wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;).

The population crash may also be due to the Allee effect, named after zoologist Warder Clyde Allee. Allee proposed that social animals require a critical mass in order to survive, because survival requires group activities, such as warning of predators and migration. A decline below that threshold precipates rapid decline. Ecologist Justin Brashares suggests that at least some of the marmot&#x27;s group behavior is learned, so that the loss of marmot &quot;culture&quot; has caused them to become more solitary, and interact aggressively rather than cooperatively when they do encounter each other.

The Vancouver Island marmot remains one of the world&#x27;s rarest mammals. By 1997 their population had declined to the point that it became necessary to capture several individuals to create a &quot;genetic lifeboat&quot; for the eventual restoration of the wild population. The first marmots went to Toronto Zoo in 1997, and others were later sent to the Calgary Zoo and Mountainview Conservation and Breeding Centre in Langley, BC.

In 1998 a new model for species recovery was developed involving the collaboration of government, private industry and public donors. A census in late 2003 resulted in a count of only 21 wild marmots known to be present on four mountains of Vancouver Island. After these findings, marmots were released from captivity in different places to try to get the population back up to a reasonable number.

These marmots are still classified as endangered. The cumulative captive breeding program has steadily grown, with 130 individuals in captivity (2010) and 442 weaned pups born in captivity since 2000. A number of individuals have been released to Strathcona Provincial Park, Mount Cain, Mount Washington and more southern mountains. The Marmot Recovery Foundation has built a dedicated marmot facility on Mount Washington to further facilitate captive breeding and pre-release conditioning. Between 2003 and 2010, the Marmot Recovery Foundation and the British Columbia Ministry of Environment have released 308 marmots back into the wild. More releases are expected in the upcoming years to increase the wild population, estimated at 250–300 individuals in 2010, and 350–400 individuals in 2013. The wild population was counted at 250 in 2021. Due to conservation and recovery efforts, the population of Vancouver Island marmots has significantly increased since 2003. Nevertheless, Vancouver Island marmot populations continue to fluctuate due to natural events as well as increased predation.

== Related species ==
Based on genetic analyses, the closest relatives of the Vancouver Island marmot are the hoary marmot (&quot;Marmota caligata&quot;) and the Olympic marmot (&quot;Marmota olympus&quot;). There is some debate, on genetic grounds, about which of the two nearby mainland species is most closely related to the Vancouver Island marmot 
or when marmots first arrived on the island. 
The differences in DNA observed between species is small. In 2009, Nagorsen and Cardini identified, from museum specimens, substantial physical differences between species that can be explained only by rapid evolution in a relatively isolated island context.

== In popular culture ==
Because of their endangered status, Vancouver Island marmots have become a conservation symbol in British Columbia.
* Mukmuk, &quot;sidekick&quot; to the three official mascots for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, is portrayed as a member of the species.
* The Victoria Royals hockey team mascot, &quot;Marty the Marmot&quot;, is based on the Vancouver Island marmot, which the team created to represent the importance of the species to the Vancouver Island region. The marmot was also the former mascot of the now defunct Victoria Salmon Kings hockey team.
* Wild marmots: &quot;Chopper&quot;, &quot;Marlu&quot;, and &quot;Van Isle Violet&quot;, Groundhog Day forecast, via the &quot;Marmot Recovery Foundation&quot; at Nanaimo, Vancouver Island.
In 2023 the Vancouver Island marmot was featured on a United States Postal Service forever stamp as part of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; set, based on a photograph from Joel Sartore&#x27;s &quot;Photo Ark&quot;. The stamp was dedicated at a ceremony at the National Grasslands Visitor Center in Wall, South Dakota.

<doc id="1111991" wikidata="Q2079221" url="?curid=1111991" title="Genetics and the Origin of Species">
<text>Genetics and the Origin of Species is a 1937 book by the Ukrainian-American evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky. It is regarded as one of the most important works of modern synthesis and was one of the earliest. The book popularized the work of population genetics to other biologists and influenced their appreciation for the genetic basis of evolution. In his book, Dobzhansky applied the theoretical work of Sewall Wright (1889–1988) to the study of natural populations, allowing him to address evolutionary problems in a novel way during his time. Dobzhansky implements theories of mutation, natural selection, and speciation throughout his book to explain the habits of populations and the resulting effects on their genetic behavior. The book explains evolution in depth as a process over time that accounts for the diversity of all life on Earth. The study of evolution was present, but greatly neglected at the time. Dobzhansky illustrates that evolution regarding the origin and nature of species during this time in history was deemed mysterious, but had expanding potential for progress to be made in its field.

==Background==
In Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection, more organisms are produced than can survive. Some have variations that give them a competitive advantage, and they have the best chance of surviving and procreating. The main element lacking in the theory was any mechanism that would allow organisms to pass on these favorable variations. Lacking such a mechanism, the theory of evolution faced competition from theories such as neo-Lamarckism, in which the environment acted directly on organisms, changing their structures. Darwin did not know that the monk Gregor Mendel was already working on experiments that would explain inheritance in terms of units of heredity that we now call genes.

When Mendelian genetics was rediscovered by several scientists, it initially increased the confusion. The Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries developed a theory called mutationism in which most variations were inconsequential and could not lead to species change. Instead, new species were formed by large mutations. At first, geneticists tended to support mutationism; but in the 1920s and 1930s a group of theoretical geneticists – particularly Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright – showed that Mendel&#x27;s laws could explain continuous variation in biological characteristics; and that natural selection could act cumulatively, giving rise to large changes. Their work provided a theoretical framework for incorporating genetics into the theory of evolution.

Many biologists fell into two camps: the geneticists, who mostly worked in the laboratory; and naturalists, who studied natural populations in the field and museums, and put much of their effort into taxonomy. Each contributed concepts that were essential to the understanding of evolution. Naturalists introduced the biological species concept, the definition of species as a community that is reproductively isolated and occupies a distinctive ecological niche. They also recognized that species are &quot;polytypic&quot;, having variations in time and space; and that behavior and change of function can give rise to evolutionary change.

The two groups used such different methods and terminology that it was difficult for them to communicate. They were often battling over the same scarce academic resources, and each was often scornful of the other. As the paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson put it, paleontologists believed that &quot;a geneticist was a person who shut himself in a room, pulled down the shades, watched small flies disporting themselves in milk bottles, and thought that he was studying nature.&quot; Meanwhile, naturalists were &quot;like a man who undertakes to study the principles of the internal combustion engine by standing on a street corner and watching the motor cars whiz by.&quot;

==Publication==

The book began as a series of lectures at Columbia University in October and November 1936. Dobzhansky decided to attend the summer 1936 meeting of the Genetics Society of America in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. When the geneticist Leslie Dunn learned of this, he invited Dobzhansky to give a series of lectures at Columbia. He sent the invitation in April, and within a month he had suggested that the lectures be a springboard for writing a general treatise on evolutionary genetics. Dobzhansky was enthusiastic, and in May he wrote back, proposing the title &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot;. He envisioned two parts – &quot;part I containing data on the sources of evolutionary change, and part II containing a discussion of their interactions leading to race- and species formation.&quot; After the lectures (for which he received $500), Dobzhansky returned to Pasadena, and in December Columbia University Press accepted his proposal for a book. The pace of writing was helped by a riding accident in February 1937 in which he crushed his knee, rendering him immobile; and by April he was able to send a manuscript to Dunn for his perusal.

While reading the manuscript, Dunn persuaded the university to revive the Jesup lectures, a series that had involved some notable lecturers in the past. It was back-dated so that Dobzhansky&#x27;s lectures became the first in the series. The Columbia University Biological Series was also revived, and when &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; was published in October 1937 it became the 11th volume in that series.

Three main editions were published, in 1937, 1941 and 1951, each with significant changes. Dobzhansky considered &quot;Genetics of the Evolutionary Process&quot; (1970) a fourth edition, but one so much changed that it needed a new title.

==Contents of the first edition==
&quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; has two main points to make. The first is that speciation is a genuine problem that must be explained by the theory of evolution. In nature, there is not a single population of organisms separated from each other by small variations. Instead, the natural world is divided into species, each with its own limited range of variability. The second point is that all the variations can be explained by the principles of genetics.

The 1937 edition was divided into nine chapters, whose contents are described below.

===Organic diversity===
The first chapter is a short outline of the main points of the book: Evolutionary theory must account for variations on the level of the individual and also that of populations and species. It must explain how reproductive isolation can occur. And the goal is to explain all this using genetic principles that can be verified in the laboratory.

===Gene mutation===
The second chapter argues that mutations occur frequently and are random in direction. Most are small in effect, but they affect all features of organisms and vary from beneficial to lethal. They are sufficient to provide the raw material for natural selection.

===Mutation as a basis for racial and specific differences===
In the third chapter, Dobzhansky demonstrates that the mutations that are observed in the laboratory also occur in nature, where they are acted on by natural selection. Thus, there is nothing intrinsically different about the process by which new species evolve.

===Chromosomal changes===
Dobzhansky continues the theme of continuity between the laboratory and nature in chapter 4, showing that variations in the structure, arrangement and number of chromosomes occur in both the laboratory and nature. He shows that chromosomal translocation, a rearrangement of parts in chromosomes, accounts for racial differences in &quot;Datura stramonium&quot; (jimson-weed). Chromosomal inversion, a reversal of a segment, is the basis for differentiation in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. He also points out that these effects demonstrate that the chromosome parts are interdependent.

===Variation in natural populations===
Having established that the sources of natural variation are mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, Dobzhansky considers what shapes and preserves this variation. In the first edition of this book, he considers genetic drift as important as natural selection. As an example, he argued that drift was the reason for racial variations that were observed in &quot;Partula&quot;, a land snail, so these variations had no adaptive advantage. He argued that most such variations, which he called &quot;microgeographic race&quot;, was nonadaptive. Because variation is not always controlled by selection, we need to know the size of a population before we can predict its evolutionary dynamics.

===Selection===
The sixth chapter discusses the evidence for natural selection from experiments in the laboratory and observations of nature. He considered examples of camouflage such as industrial melanism, in which moths and other arthropods evolve darker pigmentation when exposed to an environment with a lot of soot in it. He refuted some Mendelian misconceptions about the effectiveness of natural selection, but he also rejected the strict selectionism of Fisher.

===Polyploidy===
In the seventh chapter, Dobzhansky discusses polyploidy, a condition (common in plants) where an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes. (Humans are diploid, having one set each from the mother and father.) He discusses case histories such as that of Raphanobrassica, a hybrid between the radish and the cabbage. This is an example of &quot;cataclysmic&quot; speciation, an exception to his general rule that speciation is a slow process.

===Isolating mechanisms===

An &quot;isolating mechanism&quot; prevents members of two different species from successfully producing offspring. Dobzhansky invented the term, and in the eighth chapter he discusses their role in speciation. His views were sufficiently original for him to publish them in a journal article as well. Although previous authors had recognized the importance of isolation, their reasons were entirely different from his. George Romanes thought that isolation was a cause of change, whereas Dobzhansky sees two competing effects. Isolation reduces the rate of formation of harmful gene combinations, but it also restricts the scope of genetic variation. Thus, a species remains near a given peak in the fitness landscape and does not find new adaptive peaks.

Dobzhansky presents a classification of isolating mechanisms. The main division is between hybrid sterility, which he discusses in the next chapter, and mechanisms that prevent organisms from mating. These include geographic and ecological isolation. After two populations are changed sufficiently, &quot;physiological&quot; isolating mechanisms prevent them from mating, so they will remain distinct even if they are no longer physically isolated. This isolation is the end of a continuous process that includes division into races, and involves multiple mutations.

===Hybrid sterility===
In the chapter on isolating mechanisms, Dobzhansky deplores the &quot;appallingly insufficient attention&quot; that geneticists had devoted to isolation. The only isolating mechanism that they had studied was sterility in hybrid organisms, so he devotes the ninth chapter to a particularly detailed analysis of the literature on this subject.
==Experiments==

Through his work on &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot;, a species of fruitfly, Dobzhansky was able to identify that some populations of this species did not have identical sets of genes. Dobzhansky used experimental breeding in laboratories and gardens, and also surveys related to species in nature to help support aspects of organic evolution. The data in his book show the different genetic mutations and chromosomal changes that were observed. These experiments are vital to this book because they illustrate a transition from the laboratory to the greater field of genetics. &quot;Drosophila&quot; enabled researchers to gain a deeper understanding of how scientific knowledge about heredity has expanded and contributed to other areas of biology. By focusing on the opportunities and constraints of the research organism, persuasive accounts of the chromosomal genetics of &quot;Drosophila&quot; eventually evolved into the genetics of natural populations in the 1930s. All of the results from his experiments support the theory of modern evolutionary synthesis.

===Mutations===
Through his experiments, Dobzhansky discovers that mutation of genes leads to evolution within a specific species. Adaptations play a large role in genetic drift, and it is known that genes and mutations influence this genetic drift in a particular environment. Mutations can result from external influences within the surrounding environment, especially if an organism inhabits an area with harsh living conditions. An organism can adapt to its environment in order to better suit its own needs. When an organism successfully adapts, it has higher survival and reproduction rates. Therefore, there is a higher chance that its genes will be passed on to its offspring. Specific genes and alleles are then passed on to future generations to continue the trend of modern evolution that Dobzhansky presents in the book.

Dobzhansky said that natural mutation, aided by variation, can lead to change when acted upon by natural selection. Mutations were thought to be relatively rare and other variations were even considered to be harmful. Since an organism&#x27;s overall genetic make-up was the result of natural selection, with damaging mutations weeded out, wild populations were assumed to have very few mutations. As a result, evolution was said to be a relatively slow process. One of Dobzhansky&#x27;s major contributions in this book was to show that this view of slow-moving evolution was incorrect. While analyzing chromosome structure in wild populations of &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot;, Dobzhansky discovered a surprising amount of undiscovered variability. These variations could not be observed in the outward appearance of the individual organisms. Dobzhansky suggested that the preservation of extensive variation would allow populations to evolve rapidly as environmental conditions change. This book was a landmark in the evolutionary synthesis, as it presented the union of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian theory.

In &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot;, polyploidy is considered as a type of mutation. Polyploid cells have a chromosome number that is more than twice the haploid number. The effects of polyploidy between two different species causes hybridization and even greater evolution.

===Natural selection and speciation===
Natural selection in an environment produces reproductive success, which benefits the species. Speciation is a process of evolution through which new biological species are formed. Dobzhansky studied the specifics of sexual, physiological, and behavioral isolating mechanisms in &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot; and &quot;Drosophila paulistrorum.&quot; Like many of his other studies, Dobzhansky&#x27;s work on reproductive isolation was aimed at studying the process of evolution in action. Bringing samples from each population back into the laboratory, Dobzhansky showed that he could vary environmental conditions so as to produce the same changes in frequency of inversion patterns that were observed with changing seasons in the field. Dobzhansky concluded that such seasonal fluctuations were the result of natural selection at work, with temperature acting as the selecting agent. These masterful studies provided concrete support for the theory of natural selection, at the same time illustrating the fruitfulness of combining field and laboratory work in the study of evolution. Adaptive evolution occurs through the dominance and survival of competing genes within a species. This is caused by increasing the frequency of those alleles whose phenotypic effects selfishly promote their own reproduction. He also believed new species could not arise from single mutations and must be isolated from others of its species by time, geography, habitat, or breeding season.

==Historical impact==
&quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; provided the outline for a synthesis of genetics with evolution, and was enthusiastically received by both geneticists and naturalists. Dobzhansky laid out an advanced account of the evolutionary process in genetic terms, and he backed up his work with experimental evidence supporting the theoretical arguments. This led to the stimulation of the field of evolutionary genetics, and contributions to the theory soon began to follow. This had a powerful impact on naturalists and experimental biologists, who quickly embraced this new understanding of the evolutionary process as one of genetic change in populations. It was not long before the synthesis was broadened to include paleontology, systematics and botany in a series of notable books: &quot;Systematics and the Origin of Species&quot; (1942) by Ernst Mayr; &quot;Tempo and Mode in Evolution&quot; (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and &quot;Variation and Evolution in Plants&quot; (1950) by G. Ledyard Stebbins. The emerging synthesis was called the evolutionary synthesis by Julian Huxley in his book, &quot;&quot;. In 1947, a diverse collection of biologists met at a symposium in Princeton and declared their acceptance of this synthesis. However, it was not yet complete. Developmental biologists did not accept that the theory explained their observations, and it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that molecular biology bridged the gap. Also, for decades there was disagreement over whether the unit of selection was the gene or the individual as a whole.

In 1974 all the living founders of the modern synthesis (with the exception of Simpson and Bernhard Rensch) met with historians of biology in a conference to evaluate their work. All acknowledged &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; as the direct instigator of all the work that followed. Ernst Mayr, in &quot;The Growth of Biological Thought&quot;, said that it was &quot;clearly the most decisive event in the history of evolutionary biology since the publication of the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; in 1859.&quot; 

==Awards==
Dobzhansky was plagued by a form of leukemia in his later years, but he remained vigorously active until the day before his death on December 18, 1975. During his lifetime he was the recipient of many honors and awards. For &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; Dobzhansky was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1941. Sixty years after its publication, the National Academy of Sciences commissioned a book entitled &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species: From Darwin to Molecular Biology 60 Years After Dobzhansky&quot;.

It was also included in the 1990 edition of &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot;, placing it with Charles Darwin&#x27;s two great works &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; and &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;. A third edition was published in 1951.

<doc id="1112015" wikidata="Q1570106" url="?curid=1112015" title="Scheimpflug principle">
<text>The Scheimpflug principle is a description of the geometric relationship between the orientation of the plane of focus, the lens plane, and the image plane of an optical system (such as a camera) when the lens plane is not parallel to the image plane. It is applicable to the use of some camera movements on a view camera. It is also the principle used in corneal pachymetry, the mapping of corneal topography, done prior to refractive eye surgery such as LASIK, and used for early detection of keratoconus. The principle is named after Austrian army Captain Theodor Scheimpflug, who used it in devising a systematic method and apparatus for correcting perspective distortion in aerial photographs, although Captain Scheimpflug himself credits Jules Carpentier with the rule, thus making it an example of Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy.

==Description==

Normally, the lens and image (film or sensor) planes of a camera are parallel, and the plane of focus (PoF) is parallel to the lens and image planes. If a planar subject (such as the side of a building) is also parallel to the image plane, it can coincide with the PoF, and the entire subject can be rendered sharply. If the subject plane is not parallel to the image plane, it will be in focus only along a line where it intersects the PoF, as illustrated in Figure 1.

But when a lens is tilted with respect to the image plane, an oblique tangent extended from the image plane and another extended from the lens plane meet at a line through which the PoF also passes, as illustrated in Figure 2. With this condition, a planar subject that is not parallel to the image plane can be completely in focus. While many photographers were/are unaware of the exact geometric relationship between the PoF, lens plane, and film plane, swinging and tilting the lens to swing and tilt the PoF was practiced since the middle of the 19th century. But, when Carpentier and Scheimpflug wanted to produce equipment to automate the process, they needed to find a geometric relationship.

Scheimpflug (1904) referenced this concept in his British patent; Carpentier (1901) also described the concept in an earlier British patent for a perspective-correcting photographic enlarger. The concept can be inferred from a theorem in projective geometry of Gérard Desargues; the principle also readily derives from simple geometric considerations and application of the Gaussian thin-lens formula, as shown in the section Proof of the Scheimpflug principle.

==Changing the plane of focus==
When the lens and image planes are not parallel, adjusting focus rotates the PoF rather than merely displacing it along the lens axis. The axis of rotation is the intersection of the lens&#x27;s front focal plane and a plane through the center of the lens parallel to the image plane, as shown in Figure 3. As the image plane is moved from IP1 to IP2, the PoF rotates about the axis G from position PoF1 to position PoF2; the &quot;Scheimpflug line&quot; moves from position S1 to position S2. The axis of rotation has been given many different names: &quot;counter axis&quot; (Scheimpflug 1904), &quot;hinge line&quot; (Merklinger 1996), and &quot;pivot point&quot; (Wheeler).

Refer to Figure 4; if a lens with focal length f is tilted by an angle θ relative to the image plane, the distance J from the center of the lens to the axis G is given by

:formula_1

If v′ is the distance along the line of sight from the image plane to the center of the lens, the angle ψ between the image plane and the PoF is given by

:formula_2

Equivalently, on the object side of the lens, if u′ is the distance along the line of sight from the center of the lens to the PoF, the angle ψ is given by

:formula_3

The angle ψ increases with focus distance; when the focus is at infinity, the PoF is perpendicular to the image plane for any nonzero value of tilt. The distances u′ and v′ along the line of sight are &quot;not&quot; the object and image distances u and v used in the thin-lens formula

:formula_4
where the distances are perpendicular to the lens plane. Distances u and v are related to the line-of-sight distances by
 and

For an essentially planar subject, such as a roadway extending for miles from the camera on flat terrain, the tilt can be set to place the axis G in the subject plane, and the focus then adjusted to rotate the PoF so that it coincides with the subject plane. The entire subject can be in focus, even if it is not parallel to the image plane.

The plane of focus also can be rotated so that it does not coincide with the subject plane, and so that only a small part of the subject is in focus. This technique sometimes is referred to as &quot;anti-Scheimpflug&quot;, though it actually relies on the Scheimpflug principle.

Rotation of the plane of focus can be accomplished by rotating either the lens plane or the image plane. Rotating the lens (as by adjusting the front standard on a view camera) does not alter linear perspective in a planar subject such as the face of a building, but requires a lens with a large image circle to avoid vignetting. Rotating the image plane (as by adjusting the back or rear standard on a view camera) alters perspective (e.g., the sides of a building converge), but works with a lens that has a smaller image circle. Rotation of the lens or back about a horizontal axis is commonly called &quot;tilt&quot;, and rotation about a vertical axis is commonly called &quot;swing&quot;.
==Camera movements==
Tilt and swing are movements available on most view cameras, often on both the front and rear standards, and on some small- and medium format cameras using special lenses that partially emulate view-camera movements. Such lenses are often called tilt-shift or &quot;perspective control&quot; lenses. For some camera models there are adapters that enable movements with some of the manufacturer&#x27;s regular lenses, and a crude approximation may be achieved with such attachments as the &#x27;Lensbaby&#x27; or by &#x27;freelensing&#x27;.

==Depth of field==
When the lens and image planes are parallel, the depth of field (DoF) extends between parallel planes on either side of the plane of focus. When the Scheimpflug principle is employed, the DoF becomes wedge shaped (Merklinger 1996, 32; Tillmanns 1997, 71), with the apex of the wedge at the PoF rotation axis, as shown in Figure 5. The DoF is zero at the apex, remains shallow at the edge of the lens&#x27;s field of view, and increases with distance from the camera. The shallow DoF near the camera requires the PoF to be positioned carefully if near objects are to be rendered sharply.

On a plane parallel to the image plane, the DoF is equally distributed above and below the PoF; in Figure 5, the distances yn and yf on the plane VP are equal. This distribution can be helpful in determining the best position for the PoF; if a scene includes a distant tall feature, the best fit of the DoF to the scene often results from having the PoF pass through the vertical midpoint of that feature. The angular DoF, however, is &quot;not&quot; equally distributed about the PoF.

The distances yn and yf are given by (Merklinger 1996, 126)

:formula_5

where f is the lens focal length, v′ and u′ are the image and object distances parallel to the line of sight, uh is the hyperfocal distance, and J is the distance from the center of the lens to the PoF rotation axis. By solving the image-side equation for for v′ and substituting for v′ and uh in the equation above, the values may be given equivalently by

:formula_6

where N is the lens f-number and c is the circle of confusion. At a large focus distance (equivalent to a large angle between the PoF and the image plane), , and (Merklinger 1996, 48)

:formula_7

or

:formula_8

Thus at the hyperfocal distance, the DoF on a plane parallel to the image plane extends a distance of J on either side of the PoF.

With some subjects, such as landscapes, the wedge-shaped DoF is a good fit to the scene, and satisfactory sharpness can often be achieved with a smaller lens f-number (larger aperture) than would be required if the PoF were parallel to the image plane.

===Selective focus===

The region of sharpness can also be made very small by using large tilt and a small &quot;f&quot;-number. For example, with 8° tilt on a 90 mm lens for a small-format camera, the total vertical DoF at the hyperfocal distance is approximately

:formula_9

At an aperture of &quot;f&quot;/2.8, with a circle of confusion of 0.03 mm, this occurs at a distance &quot;u′&quot; of approximately

:formula_10

Of course, the tilt also affects the position of the PoF, so if the tilt is chosen to minimize the region of sharpness, the PoF cannot be set to pass through more than one arbitrarily chosen point. If the PoF is to pass through more than one arbitrary point, the tilt and focus are fixed, and the lens &quot;f&quot;-number is the only available control for adjusting sharpness.

==Derivation of the formulas==

=== Proof of the Scheimpflug principle ===
In a two-dimensional representation, an object plane inclined to the lens
plane is a line described by

:formula_11 .

By optical convention, both object and image distances are positive for real images, so that in Figure 6, the object distance &quot;u&quot; increases to the left of the lens plane LP; the vertical axis uses the normal Cartesian convention, with values above the optical axis positive and those below the optical axis negative.

The relationship between the object distance &quot;u&quot;, the image distance &quot;v&quot;, and the lens focal length &quot;f&quot; is given by the thin-lens equation

:formula_12

solving for &quot;u&quot; gives

:formula_13

so that

:formula_14 .

The magnification &quot;m&quot; is the ratio of image height &quot;yv&quot; to object height 

:formula_15

&quot;yu&quot; and &quot;yv&quot; are of opposite sense, so the magnification is negative, indicating an inverted image. From similar triangles in Figure 6, the magnification also relates the image and object distances, so that

:formula_16 .

On the image side of the lens,

:formula_17

giving

:formula_18 .

The locus of focus for the inclined object plane is a plane; in two-dimensional representation, the y-intercept is the same as that for the line describing the object plane, so the object plane, lens plane, and image plane have a common intersection.

A similar proof is given by Larmore (1965, 171–173).

=== Angle of the PoF with the image plane ===
From Figure 7,

:formula_19

where u′ and v′ are the object and image distances along the line of sight and S is the distance from the line of sight to the Scheimpflug intersection at S. Again from Figure 7,

:formula_20

combining the previous two equations gives

:formula_21

From the thin-lens equation,

:formula_22

Solving for u′ gives

:formula_23

substituting this result into the equation for gives

:formula_24

or

:formula_25

Similarly, the thin-lens equation can be solved for v′, and the result substituted into the equation for to give the object-side relationship

:formula_26

Noting that

:formula_27
the relationship between ψ and θ can be expressed in terms of the magnification m of the object in the line of sight:

:formula_28

=== Proof of the &quot;hinge rule&quot; ===
From Figure 7,

:formula_29

combining with the previous result for the object side and eliminating ψ gives

:formula_30

Again from Figure 7,

:formula_31

so the distance d is the lens focal length f, and the point G is at the intersection the lens&#x27;s front focal plane with a line parallel to the image plane. The distance J depends only on the lens tilt and the lens focal length; in particular, it is not affected by changes in focus. From Figure 7,

:formula_32

so the distance to the Scheimpflug intersection at S varies as the focus is changed. Thus the PoF rotates about the axis at G as focus is adjusted.

<doc id="1112021" wikidata="Q523029" url="?curid=1112021" title="Marder (infantry fighting vehicle)">
<text>The Schützenpanzer Marder 1 (; &quot;&quot;Schützen&quot; carrying &quot;Armour&quot;-ed fighting vehicle &quot;Marten 1&quot;&quot;) is a tracked German infantry fighting vehicle designed for use with the West German Panzergrenadiere units, mechanized infantry specialized for IFV combat. It has been operated by the German Army as the main Panzergrenadiere IFV since the 1970s through to the present day. Developed as part of the rebuilding of West Germany&#x27;s armoured fighting vehicle industry, the Marder has proven to be a successful and solid infantry fighting vehicle design.

While it used to include a few unique features, such as a fully remote machine gun on the rear deck and gun ports on the sides for infantry to fire through, these features have been deleted or streamlined in later upgrade packages to bring it more in line with modern IFV design. The MG has been moved to be a coaxial, the gun ports entirely welded shut and uparmored. It is overall a simple and conventional machine with one large rear exit hatch and three top hatches for mounted infantry to fire from.

Around 2,100 were taken into service by the West German army in the early 1970s, but the vehicle in its German variant was not sold to any foreign militaries. As the West German Army began to retire older vehicles, the Chilean government agreed to acquire 200 Marders; the government of Greece has considered the purchase of 450 retired vehicles in the past. Argentina uses a simplified and locally produced variant, the VCTP, and has a number of vehicles based on that platform constructed by Henschel and built by TAMSE.

The intended successor to the Marder 1 was initially the Marder 2 project in the 1990s, but after its cancellation the successor became the Puma in the 2010s. The Marder is currently being replaced by the Puma.

==Development==
Development of the Marder ran from January 1960, when the first development contracts were issued, to May 1971, when the first production vehicles were given to the West German army.

The vehicle was intended to be an improvement over the Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30. The main requirements were:
* A capacity of 12 infantrymen.
* A more reliable 20 mm cannon.
* The infantry must be able to fight from within the vehicle or dismounted.
* Protection from nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.

Initially, development contracts were awarded to two groups of companies: the Rheinstahl group (Rheinstahl-Hanomag, Ruhrstahl, Witten-Annen, Büro Warnecke) and the second group comprising Henschel Werke and the Swiss MOWAG company. This resulted in the production of seven prototype vehicles. A second set of eight prototype vehicles were built between 1961 and 1963. Development priority was then switched for a while to the development of the Jagdpanzer 90 mm Kanone.

In 1967, after military requirements were finalized, a third and final set of ten prototypes were built. Final development work was completed by the Rheinstahl group. 10 pre-production vehicles were built and completed troop trials with the West German army between October 1968 and March 1969. In May 1969, the vehicle was named the &quot;Marder&quot; after the European pine marten, an agile, short-legged, bushy-tailed, medium-sized carnivorous mammal in the weasel family. In October Rheinstahl was chosen as the prime contractor.

The first production Marder was handed to the West German army in May 1971. Production of the vehicle continued until 1975, with 2,136 vehicles being completed.

In 1975, the MILAN anti-tank guided missile was adapted to be fired by the commander from his open hatch. Between 1977 and 1979 MILAN missiles were fitted to the Marders.

A number of upgrade programs were carried out, that included fitting night vision equipment and a thermal imager, as well as an upgraded ammunition feed to the 20 mm cannon.

Around 1985, the designation was changed to Marder 1 (until then it was simply Marder) since a follow-up IFV was under construction. The new vehicle was supposed to be the partner of the Leopard 2, just like Marder was the companion to the Standardpanzer/Leopard 1, it was named Marder 2 and the older vehicles re-designated.

The A3 upgrade program began in 1988. Thyssen-Henschel was awarded a contract to upgrade 2,100 Marder 1 A1/A2 series vehicles to A3 standard, at a rate of 220 a year. The first upgraded vehicles reached the West German army in November 1989. The modification package included:
* Improved armour, weighing 1,600 kg, intended to protect against the 30 mm 2A42 cannon on the Russian BMP-2. The armour provided additional protection against cluster bomblets.
* The hatches over the infantry compartment were rearranged.
* The suspension was reinforced, a new braking system was installed, and the gearbox adjusted. The heating system was replaced with a water based heating system.
* The turret was reconfigured.
* The new total weight was 35,000 kg.

==Description==
The hull of the Marder 1 is all welded steel, giving protection from small-arms fire and shell fragments. The front of the hull provided protection from up to 20 mm armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) rounds. Later variants increased protection up to 30mm APDS, in response to the 30 mm autocannon armed BMP-2 and the development of top-attack cluster bomblets.

The Marder is a relatively conventional design, with the driver sitting at the front left side of the hull with the engine to the driver&#x27;s right. The driver has three day periscopes mounted in a hatch that opens to the right. The center periscope can be replaced by a passive night vision device. Behind the driver is a seat for a single infantryman. In early versions of the Marder, this infantryman had a hatch that opened to the right and a periscope that could be rotated through 360 degrees. This hatch was removed in the 1A3 variant onwards.

In the centre of the hull is the two-man turret, which holds the commander on the right and the gunner on the left. Only the commander is provided with a hatch. The commander has eight day periscopes for all round observation and the gunner has three. The primary sighting system is the PERI-Z11 sight, which has either 2× or 6× optical magnification. From version 1A2 on, there is an additional thermal sight with 2x and 8x magnification. To the rear of the turret is the troop compartment, which can hold six infantry men, sitting back to back facing outwards along the center of the hull.

The Marder is capable of fording in up to 1.5 meters of water unprepared. It can be fitted with a kit allowing it to ford water up to 2.5 meters deep.

The vehicle is powered by an MTU MB 833 Ea-500 six-cylinder liquid-cooled sequentially turbocharged diesel engine which delivers approximately at 2,200 rpm. The cooling radiators are mounted at the rear of the hull, either side of the exit ramp. The engine is coupled to a Renk four speed HSWL 194 planetary gear box, with four forward and four reverse gears. The transmission also provides steering and braking via a stepless hydrostatic unit, which transmits power to two drive units mounted at the front of the hull. The vehicle carries 652 liters of fuel, giving it a road range of around 500 kilometres. Early Marders could achieve a road speed of 75 km/h in 4th gear, but the extra armour of later vehicles reduced this to 65 km/h.

The Marder is propelled by a Diehl track, which can be fitted with rubber road pads or metallic grousers for improved mobility in snow. The drive mechanism consists of six rubber tyred road wheels, with a drive sprocket at the front of the hull and an idler at the rear. Three return rollers are fitted. The suspension is a torsion bar system, with hydrostatic shock absorbers fitted to the front two and last two road wheels.

===Armament===

The primary armament is the 20 mm Rheinmetall MK 20 Rh202 autocannon. It is mounted in the small two-man turret and can fire either armour-piercing or HE rounds. Mounted coaxially to the left of the cannon is a 7.62 mm MG 3 machine gun. The turret has 360 degree traverse, and can elevate from −17 degrees to +65 degrees, at a rate of 40 degrees per second while traversing at a rate of 60 degrees a second.

Early production Marders, up to and including version 1A1 had a second, rear-facing MG 3 mounted on the rear deck in a remote controlled pod and operated by one of the mounted infantry using a co-axial PERI-Z12 periscope sight (with a 180° horizontal traverse arc and a vertical arc of -15° to +55°). Typically, 1,250 rounds are carried for the 20 mm cannon, along with a further 5,000 rounds for the MG3.

On models since version 1A1A, a MILAN anti-tank guided missile launcher can be attached to the turret to provide enhanced anti-armour capabilities. Typically, four missiles are carried inside the vehicle.

There are four gun ports, two per side, which can be used by mounted infantry to provide additional fire against attacking infantry targets. Only Marder 1A1 and 1A2 were equipped with this. Marder 1A3 and above do not have gun ports due to the fitting of an extra layer of armour and outside storage boxes.

Six 76-millimeter-diameter smoke grenade dischargers can create a visual and infrared blocking smoke screen.

== Combat service ==

With the first unit delivered in summer 1971, the Marder IFV remained untested in combat for 38 years until July 2009 when they defended a German combat outpost against the Taliban in Chahar Dara district of Afghanistan&#x27;s Kunduz Province, killing and wounding scores of enemies. Since then, the Marders have been involved in heavy fighting several times. The vehicles have proved to be extremely useful and have been praised as a great tactical asset by German troops. However, the crews have been subject to great physical stress as none of the vehicles are equipped with air conditioning systems.

Two Marders were damaged by improvised explosive devices in the course of a German-led offensive on Taliban fighters in Quatliam, on 31 October 2010. Later in the battle, code-named by the Coalition &quot;Operation Halmazag&quot;, a single Marder beat off a Taliban attempt to outflank positions held by German paratroopers. On 2 June 2011, a German Marder was destroyed near Kunduz by a 200 kg (440.91 lbs.) IED, killing one soldier and injuring five others.

The Marder was deployed during the Kosovo War as part of the German peacekeeping forces sent as part of NATO&#x27;s Kosovo Force (KFOR).
On 29 March 2023, Ukrainian Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov announced that Marders donated from Germany during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had arrived in the country. They were first used by the 82nd Air Assault Brigade in August as part of the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive; 100 vehicles had been delivered by that time.&lt;br&gt;

According to the Oryx blog as of 3 September 2024, at least 26 Ukrainian Marders had been confirmed to have been lost by photos or videos; 13 destroyed, 3 damaged, 8 abandoned and 2 captured.

== Variants ==
The Marder 1A3 is currently the most common version of this system, and is in service with the German Bundeswehr. The Marder 1A4 differs from the 1A3 only by the use of a cryptography-capable radio-set. The newest version of the Marder is the Marder 1A5 with advanced mine protection. Only a small number of this variant is in service.

=== Derivative models ===

The Marder served as the basis for Thyssen-Henschel&#x27;s medium tank design which became the TAM for Argentina. A simplified version of the Marder is also employed as an infantry fighting vehicle, mortar carrier and command vehicle by the Argentine Army, realising most of the versions originally planned for the Bundeswehr and later abandoned due to costs and/or the availability of cheap alternatives like the M106 mortar carrier.

The Marder is used as a carrier for the Roland air defence system. The Kanonenjagdpanzer and Raketenjagdpanzer 2 started development as part of the Marder family but were realised based on the second batch of prototypes using different engines etc. The Kanonenjagdpanzer built for Belgium are a hybrid between the original Bundeswehr version and Marder parts. Some 4–6 test models of a 120 mm mortar on a Marder chassis were built, and at least one is in use as a firefighting vehicle at the WTS Meppen. Tests with an AAA tank were performed but the high weight of the system resulted in a switch to the heavier Standardpanzer chassis, resulting in the Gepard AAA system. At least one first or second generation prototype was equipped with the 110 mm artillery rocket system that later became the truck-mounted LARS system.

During the Eurosatory Show 2012, Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH offered two further upgrades as part of the Marder Evolution family. The first upgrade was the Marder APC which features a new M151 Protector remotely controlled weapon, replacing the original Rheinmetall MK 20 Rh 202 automatic cannon, ballistic protection comparable to STANAG Level 4+, and mine protection comparable to Level 3a/3b+. The top deck has been lifted to enable improved ergonomics and uses a MTU MB883 diesel. The other upgrade was the Marder Medium Tank which features a rifled, stabilized 105 mm OTO-Melara gun in a new turret.

At Indo Defence 2016, Rheinmetall exhibited the Marder Medium Tank RI (&quot;RI&quot; stands for &quot;Republic of Indonesia&quot;), which was offered to the Indonesian Army, at the time already operating the Marder 1A3. The tank used the Marder 1A3 hull, with the three-crew Leonardo HITFACT turret armed with an OTO-Melara 105 mm gun and two 7.62 mm machine guns used in coaxial and roof-mounted positions. The HITFACT turret was equipped with an advanced fire control system, linked with the commander and gunner sights, a laser rangefinder, and day/thermal sights for both the commander and gunner. Improvements included upgraded suspension, a new MTU diesel engine with , and the availability to mount a modular armour package.

=== Marder 2 ===

Schützenpanzer Marder 2 was a 1991 prototype German infantry fighting vehicle intended as a replacement design to the Schützenpanzer Marder 1. The project started in 1984 and was cancelled in 1992.

A prototype is preserved at the Bundeswehr Museum of German Defense Technology.

<text>Ansemund was the Gothic count of Nîmes, ruling from 752 until his death in 754.

In 752, the Gothic counts of Nîmes, Melguelh, Agde, and Béziers refused allegiance to the Cordoban emir and declared their loyalty to the Frankish Kingdom. Ansemund seems to have had some authority over the other counts. The Gothic counts and the Franks started to besiege Narbonne, but the Moors resisted. In 754, an anti-Frankish reaction led by Ermeniard killed Ansemund, but the rebellion died without success and Radulf was designated as the new count by the Frankish king, Pepin the Short.

<doc id="1112059" wikidata="Q184243" url="?curid=1112059" title="Tick-borne disease">
<text>Tick-borne diseases, which afflict humans and other animals, are caused by infectious agents transmitted by tick bites. They are caused by infection with a variety of pathogens, including rickettsia and other types of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.
The economic impact of tick-borne diseases is considered to be substantial in humans, and tick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. Most of these pathogens require passage through vertebrate hosts as part of their life cycle. Tick-borne infections in humans, farm animals, and companion animals are primarily associated with wildlife animal reservoirs. Many tick-borne infections in humans involve a complex cycle between wildlife animal reservoirs and tick vectors. The survival and transmission of these tick-borne viruses are closely linked to their interactions with tick vectors and host cells. These viruses are classified into different families, including Asfarviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae.

The occurrence of ticks and tick-borne illnesses in humans is increasing. Tick populations are spreading into new areas, in part due to climate change. Tick populations are also affected by changes in the populations of their hosts (e.g. deer, cattle, mice, lizards) and those hosts&#x27; predators (e.g. foxes). Diversity and availability of hosts and predators can be affected by deforestation and habitat fragmentation.

Because individual ticks can harbor more than one disease-causing agent, patients can be infected with more than one pathogen at the same time, compounding the difficulty in diagnosis and treatment. As the incidence of tick-borne illnesses increases and the geographic areas in which they are found expand, health workers increasingly must be able to distinguish the diverse, and often overlapping, clinical presentations of these diseases.

 18 tick-borne pathogens have been identified in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and at least 27 are known globally. New tick-borne diseases have been discovered in the 21st century, due in part to the use of molecular assays and next-generation sequencing.

==Prevention==
===Exposure===

Ticks tend to be more active during warmer months, though this varies by geographic region and climate. Areas with woods, bushes, high grass, or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Those bitten commonly experience symptoms such as body aches, fever, fatigue, joint pain, or rashes. People can limit their exposure to tick bites by wearing light-colored clothing (including pants and long sleeves), using insect repellent with 20%–30% N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), tucking their pants legs into their socks, checking for ticks frequently, and washing and drying their clothing in a hot dryer.

According to the World Health Organization, tick-to-animal transmission is difficult to prevent because animals do not show visible symptoms; the only effective prevention relies on killing ticks on the livestock production facility.

===Symptoms===

Ticks also have the potential to induce a motor illness characterized by acute, ascending flaccid paralysis. This condition can be fatal if not treated promptly, affecting both humans and animals. It is mainly associated with certain species of ticks. Symptoms typically ranges from fatigue, numbness in the legs, muscle aches, and, to in some cases, paralysis and other severe neurological manifestations.

Tick-borne diseases (TBD) are a major health threat in the US. The number of pathogens and the burden of disease have been increasing over the last couple decades. With improved diagnostics and surveillance, new pathogens are regularly identified, bettering our understanding of TBDs. Unfortunately, diagnosis of these illnesses remains a challenge, with many TBDs presenting with similar nonspecific symptoms and diagnosis requiring a battery of assays to assess patients adequately. New advanced molecular diagnostic methods, including next-generation sequencing and metagenomics analysis, promise improved detection of novel and emerging pathogens with the ability to detect a litany of potential pathogens with a single assay.

===Tick removal===

Ticks should be removed as soon as safely possible once discovered. They can be removed either by grasping tweezers as close to the mouth as possible and pulling without rotation; some companies market grooved tools that rotate the hypostome to facilitate removal. Chemical methods to make the tick self-detach, or trying to pull the tick out with one&#x27;s fingers, are not efficient methods. In Australia and New Zealand, where tick-borne infections are less common than tick reactions, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends seeking medical assistance or killing ticks in-situ by freezing and then leaving them to fall out to prevent allergic/anaphylactic reactions.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosing tick-borne diseases involves a dual approach. Some diagnoses rely on clinical observations and symptom analysis, while others are confirmed through laboratory tests. ticks can transmit a wide range of viruses, many of which are arboviruses. In general, specific laboratory tests are not available for rapid diagnosis of tick-borne diseases. Due to their seriousness, antibiotic treatment is often justified based on clinical presentation alone.

Diagnosing Lyme borreliosis relies on clinical criteria, with a history of a tick bite and associated symptoms being crucial. Laboratory diagnosis follows a &#x27;two-tiered diagnostic protocol,&#x27; involving detecting specific antibodies using methods such as immunoenzymatic assays and Western blot tests, preferably with recombinant antigens. While ELISA and Western blot have similar sensitivity, Western blot is more specific due to the identification of specific immunoreactive bands. Seroconversion typically occurs around two weeks after symptom onset, but false positive ELISA results can be linked to poorly reactive antibodies against specific antigens, especially in patients with other infectious and non-infectious diseases.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) presents non-specific clinical features, making laboratory diagnosis crucial. The diagnostic process typically involves identifying specific IgM- and IgG-serum antibodies through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) since these antibodies are detectable in most cases upon hospitalization.

== Treatment ==
Patients with Lyme disease who are treated with appropriate antibiotics usually recover rapidly and completely. Antibiotics commonly used include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil. For Anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages. For babesiosis, a combination therapy with atovaquone and azithromycin is most commonly recommended for treatment of mild to moderate babesiosis. Treatment is usually continued for 7 to 10 days. A combination regimen of oral clindamycin and quinine has also been proven effective, but the rate of adverse reactions is significantly higher with this combination. For Powassan virus, there are no medications for treating Powassan virus infections. Medications, however, can help to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. People with severe disease are typically treated in a hospital where they may be given intravenous fluids, fever-reducing medications, breathing support, and other therapies as needed.

==Assessing risk==
For a person or pet to acquire a tick-borne disease requires that the individual gets bitten by a tick and that the tick feeds for a sufficient period of time. The feeding time required to transmit pathogens differs for different ticks and different pathogens. Transmission of the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is well understood to require a substantial feeding period. In general, soft ticks (Argasidae) transmit pathogens within minutes of attachment because they feed more frequently, whereas hard ticks (Ixodidae) take hours or days, but the latter are more common and harder to remove.

For an individual to acquire infection, the feeding tick must also be infected. Not all ticks are infected. In most places in the US, 30-50% of deer ticks will be infected with &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; (the agent of Lyme disease). Other pathogens are much more rare. Ticks can be tested for infection using a highly specific and sensitive qPCR procedure. Several commercial labs provide this service to individuals for a fee. The Laboratory of Medical Zoology (LMZ), a nonprofit lab at the University of Massachusetts, provides a comprehensive TickReport for a variety of human pathogens and makes the data available to the public. Those wishing to know the incidence of tick-borne diseases in their town or state can search the LMZ surveillance database.

=== Allergies ===
* Alpha-gal allergy - Alpha-gal syndrome is likely caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to the Alpha-gal (Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose) sugar molecule introduced by ticks while feeding on a human host. The immune reaction can leave people with an allergy to red meat and other mammalian derived products.
* The experimental confirmation and investigation of how tick bites contribute to the development of AGS have been established and examined using a mouse model.

<text>Jacqueline DeLois Moore (born January 6, 1964) is an American professional wrestler and professional wrestling manager. She is best known for her time in WWE from 1998 to 2004, where she became the first African American WWE Cruiserweight Champion and one of three women to hold the championship. She also worked for World Championship Wrestling in 1997–98 and later Total Nonstop Action Wrestling as a wrestler, manager, and road agent.

She began her career in World Class Championship Wrestling, but was well known in the United States Wrestling Association, where she was a fourteen-time USWA Women&#x27;s Champion. She later moved to World Championship Wrestling, where she briefly managed the team Harlem Heat. In 1998, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later World Wrestling Entertainment). She began managing Marc Mero and had her first rivalry with Sable, which culminated in the re-establishment of the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship, which Moore held twice during her time with the WWF. In 1999, she formed an all-female alliance with Terri Runnels and Ryan Shamrock called the Pretty Mean Sisters. In the early 2000s, Moore worked as both a referee and trainer for the WWF, and she also held the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, which was a title predominantly held by men. She was the third woman to accomplish the feat, but the only woman to do so under the WWE banner (following Madusa and Daffney in WCW). In 2004, she joined TNA, where she worked mostly as a manager and occasional wrestler.

On April 2, 2016, Moore was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1988–1991) ===
Moore began her wrestling training at a local gym after meeting professional wrestling manager Skandor Akbar. She was the only female in Akbar&#x27;s professional wrestling school in Dallas. She made her in-ring debut for World Class Championship Wrestling in 1988, under the name &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown. As Sweet Georgia Brown, Moore had wrestled in Japan for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, wrestling the likes of Megumi Kudo and Combat Toyoda. She also competed in all-women&#x27;s promotions Ladies Professional Wrestling Association and Women&#x27;s Pro Wrestling.

=== United States Wrestling Association (1991–1996) ===
Moore later moved on to the United States Wrestling Association in Memphis, where she was known as Miss Texas. She made her debut as a Heel Valet to Eric Embry and Tom Prichard as part of team Texas during the Texas vs Tennessee feud. She was later involved in a feud with the Dirty White Girl Kim Anthony and was involved in a Mudpit Match and a Hair vs Hair match which Anthony won and in the latter Moore had her hair shaved off. She was the first ever USWA Women&#x27;s Champion, winning the newly created title in a tournament on March 2, 1992. Between March 1992 and August 1996, Moore held the title a total of eight times, swapping it with Lauren Davenport, Luna Vachon, and Debbie Combs. In 1993, Moore became the first female to be included in the Pro Wrestling Illustrated 500, detailing the top 500 professional wrestlers in the world. In 1995, Moore became involved in a feud with the valet of Reggie B. Fine and Don Bass, Sweet Georgia Brown. Brown was jealous of Texas after the USWA aired a music video of Moore, and they were involved in several catfights. Later in 1995, Moore feuded with Uptown Karen, the lover of Downtown Bruno. During the feud, Moore formed an alliance with former foe Sweet Georgia Brown. The Miss Texas/Uptown Karen feud culminated in a Hair vs. Hair match which was won by Texas. She also competed in Herb Abrams&#x27;s Universal Wrestling Federation, winning the promotion&#x27;s women&#x27;s title in 1994. In late 1993, she appeared in a Jeff Jarrett promo for the WWF where Jarrett would be criticizing a young man&#x27;s singing voice.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1993–1994) ===
Through the WWF&#x27;s partnership with the USWA Jacqueline was scheduled to debut in the WWF under the name Wynonna as a manager for Jeff Jarrett. Jackie filmed vignettes, but she left the WWF before debuting, due to an injury. She also appeared in the February 1994 edition of the then &quot;WWF Magazine&quot;.

=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1995) ===
Moore joined Smoky Mountain Wrestling in October 1995 under the name Sgt. Rock and joined Jim Cornette&#x27;s Militia, which included Tommy Rich, Robert Gibson, Terry Gordy, and The Punisher. However, her stint in SMW didn&#x27;t last, as the company folded at the end of November.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1997) ===
Moore began submitting pictures of herself to the Atlanta, Georgia-based World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and was eventually contacted by WCW employee J. J. Dillon, who offered her a contract. Jacqueline debuted in WCW as the manager of Kevin Sullivan, and she helped Sullivan by body slamming his opponents. She aided Sullivan in his feud with Chris Benoit and feuded with Sullivan&#x27;s ex-wife, Woman. Her alliance with Sullivan came to an end at Bash at the Beach 1997, when she smashed a wooden chair over Sullivan&#x27;s head causing him to lose a Loser Must Retire bout to Chris Benoit. At Road Wild on August 9, Jacqueline became the manager of Harlem Heat. She later engaged in a brief feud with Disco Inferno, whom she defeated at Halloween Havoc on October 26.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998–2004) ===

==== Women&#x27;s Champion (1998-2000) ====

Moore rejoined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in mid-1998, debuting on the June 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as the new on-screen girlfriend of Marc Mero, to later began a feud with the estranged wife of Mero, Sable. Sable defeated Moore in a bikini contest on July 26, 1998, at Fully Loaded: In Your House after Sable removed her halter top to reveal a painted on bikini top. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, however, disqualified Sable for not wearing a traditional bikini, and Moore was declared the winner. Moore and Mero were defeated by Sable and Edge on August 30 at SummerSlam. On the September 14, 1998, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, she would also wrestle Sable in a controversial evening gown match which saw one of her breasts exposed.

In September with the revived WWF Women&#x27;s Championship on the line (the Women&#x27;s Championship had been abandoned in December 1995), Moore defeated Sable to become the new champion, and the first African-American Women&#x27;s Champion. Two months later at Survivor Series, Sable defeated Moore to become the new champion.
Moore and Mero separated on the November 22 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, and the jilted Moore formed a new alliance of women known as the Pretty Mean Sisters (PMS) with Terri Runnels, who was separated from her husband, Goldust. During a match between Mero and Goldust on the November 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jacqueline and Terri entered the ring and low-blowed both men.

They originally formed an alliance with D&#x27;Lo Brown and Mark Henry, accompanying them to the ring for a match against Val Venis and The Godfather in December at Rock Bottom: In Your House. In January, Terri claimed to have suffered a miscarriage after she was knocked off of the ring apron by Brown. The guilty Brown became a servant to PMS, who forced him to wrestle his friend, Mark Henry. The deception lasted until February 1, when the ringside doctor told Brown that Terri had not been pregnant. PMS then feuded with Brown by costing him matches and attacking his new manager, Ivory. Jacqueline returned to the women&#x27;s division in March, and on the April 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, she, Ivory, Tori, and Sable took part in a four-way match for the Women&#x27;s Championship. The match was declared a no-contest after Sable&#x27;s bodyguard Nicole Bass stormed the ring and chokeslammed the three challengers.

In May, however, the women had switched their allegiance to a wrestler named Meat. That same month, the stable expanded once more to incorporate Ryan Shamrock, who had been spurned by the womanizing Val Venis. As part of the storyline, the three women used Meat for his body as a &quot;love slave&quot;, forcing him to have sex with them and wear wrestling tights that resembled a pair of tight underwear. After Shamrock left the WWF, Terri and Jacqueline continued to assist Meat in his matches. However, tension began to grow between the two women as Terri, in storyline, exhausted Meat with hours of sex before his matches and then berated her fatigued lover when he lacked the energy to win matches and Moore finally end the alliance by July.

On the February 1, 2000, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Jacqueline won the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship for a second time after defeating Harvey Wippleman (who had won the belt from Miss Kitty while in drag and calling himself &quot;Hervina&quot;) in a &quot;Lumberjill Snowbunny match&quot;, a match that took place in a snow filled pool surrounded by female wrestlers whose purpose was to keep The Kat and Hervina from leaving the pool. She successfully defended her title against Luna Vachon, with whom she started a brief feud, however in March, she lost the title to Stephanie McMahon, following extensive interference from D-Generation X. In June she competed in the first-ever women&#x27;s battle royal on Smackdown, to determine a #1 contender to Stephanie&#x27;s title, but failed to win.

==== Various storylines (2000–2004) ====
Throughout August and September, Moore had a series of matches against then-Women&#x27;s Champion Lita, which included a Hardcore match, as well as against Dean Malenko for the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, in which she was unsuccessful. In January 2001 during a match against Lita, both women attacked Right to Censor member Ivory, who was on commentary that night criticizing the women&#x27;s division. Later on that year, Jacqueline starred in the first season of the WWF&#x27;s reality show &quot;Tough Enough&quot; as a trainer alongside Al Snow, Tazz and Tori.

In late 2001, she took part in the Six Pack Challenge for the vacant WWF Women&#x27;s Championship on November 18 at Survivor Series, which was won by Trish Stratus. Several weeks later, Moore challenged Stratus for the title at Vengeance. Stratus won the match after surprising Moore with a backslide pin.

In 2002, Moore became a referee, with her debut match being a Women&#x27;s Championship bout between Jazz and Trish Stratus at the Royal Rumble. In late 2002, she and Stratus began a feud with Victoria, leading to a Triple Threat match at Armageddon, in which Victoria retained the title. In 2003, the return of Jazz culminated in a Four-Way match for Jazz&#x27;s title at Judgment Day on May 18, 2003, which Jazz won.

Moore seldom appeared throughout late 2003 and early 2004. On the May 6, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, WWE Cruiserweight Champion Chavo Guerrero Jr. issued an open challenge for anyone to face him for his title, and Moore defeated him to become the champion. She lost the championship back to Guerrero at Judgment Day in a match where his arm was tied behind his back. The company released Moore in June 2004 when the creative team could not come up with any storylines for her character.

=== Independent circuit (2005–2006) ===
In June 2005, she had a match with the Independent Association of Wrestling (IAW) against Vanessa Harding. On June 25, she defeated Harding and Crystal Carmichael to win the IAW Women&#x27;s Championship. In March 2006, she also competed in Mexico.

Moore, however, was defeated by Kim at Lockdown in TNA&#x27;s first women&#x27;s steel cage match. Later, during a Street Fight with Kim on the May 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Moore&#x27;s two front teeth were knocked out of her mouth after a spot where she had a trash can placed over her head and beaten with a broom stick. Moore, who would lose the match, went on later that night with Beer Money, Inc to film a promo. on the July 5 episode of Impact Wrestling, Moore lost a 3-way Knockouts match to Gail Kim also involving Ms. Brooks. On the September 27 episode of Impact Wrestling, Moore lost a fatal five-way match which was won by Roxxi Laveaux also involving Kim, Brooks and Christy Hemme.

==== Alliance with ODB (2011) ====
On June 13, 2011, Moore returned to TNA as ODB&#x27;s new tag team partner at the tapings for the June 16 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, with the two promising to clean up the Knockouts division. Both of them were billed as not being under contract with TNA. The following week Jackie and ODB defeated Velvet Sky and Ms. Tessmacher in a tag team match. On June 28 at the tapings of the July 7 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Sky defeated both Jackie and ODB in a two-on-one handicap match, forcing both of them out of TNA as per stipulation of the match. However, Jacqueline, along with ODB, returned to &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; on July 21, once again attacking Velvet Sky prior to her match with Mickie James for the TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship. They would eventually be attacked by the returning Traci Brooks, before being escorted out of the arena by police officers. On the August 18 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Jacqueline and ODB changed their attitudes, abandoning their villainous antics, in order to first get contracts with the promotion. After several weeks of working as babyfaces, Jacqueline and ODB were signed to contracts by the new head of the Knockouts division, Karen Jarrett, on the August 25 episode of Impact Wrestling, and later teamed with Velvet Sky to defeat Angelina Love, Sarita and Rosita. However, Jacqueline would not make any more appearances, before announcing on November 28 that her TNA contract had expired.

<text>Steven John Bailey (born 25 September 1955) known professionally as Steven Severin, is an English songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and producer. He is best known as the bassist of the rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees which he co-founded in 1976. He was also the co-founder of the short-lived band the Glove in 1983. He took the name &quot;Severin&quot; from the Leopold von Sacher-Masoch character who is mentioned in the Velvet Underground song &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;. After the split of Siouxsie and the Banshees in 1996, Severin created his own label RE: and released several instrumental albums via his official website. In the late 2000s and the early 2010s, he regularly performed live in solo, playing music over footage of silent films.

==Biography==
He grew up in Archway and moved to Bromley at the age of 11.
On a Sunday afternoon in 1971, he discovered German rock band Can thanks to a schoolfriend&#x27;s elder brother in the army who was stationed in Hamburg. At 15, Severin saw Captain Beefheart &amp; His Magic Band in concert in London which was a life changing experience.

His favourite writers when he was a teenager, were William Burroughs and Jean Genet amongst others: he said, &quot;Since I was very young I’ve always felt the need to retreat into my head and scratch around the rim of my imagination to shut out the trivia and carelessness of the world outside&quot;.

===Siouxsie and the Banshees===
Severin — who was known as Steven Havoc when he joined the band in September 1976 — was the co-founder with Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees; he had also earlier considered &quot;Steve Spunker&quot; for his stage name. He was a full contributor to the band&#x27;s musical output from the first release: the B-side &quot;Voices&quot; to the top 10 single &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot; was a Severin lyric.

Although the entire band often was credited for songwriting, the lyrics were usually indicated as the work of only one or two members. Severin would contribute lyrics to many of the album tracks, singles and B-sides produced by the band. He also initially wrote many of the songs recorded by the band, composing earlier versions that the band would work together to perfect. In the same way he would add his input into potential tracks contributed by Siouxsie Sioux or others.

He recorded 11 studio albums with the group. Since their split in 1996, he has been supervising the entire back-catalogue, choosing extra tracks for reissues.

===Other artists and bands===
During his tenure with Siouxsie and the Banshees, Severin was also involved in records by other bands, often with Banshees connections. Altered Images had toured as a support act for Siouxsie and the Banshees and Severin produced their first two singles &quot;Dead Pop Stars&quot; and &quot;A Day&#x27;s Wait&quot;. He also produced the majority of the album &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; (all 1981). The only track not produced by him was the title track (which also formed the intro and coda), which became the band&#x27;s breakthrough hit. When the record company realized that &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; had a commercial potential, they asked Martin Rushent to re-record it at the last minute.

In 1982, he produced, and played bass on, the Lydia Lunch EP &quot;The Agony Is the Ecstasy&quot; and in 1983 co-wrote the song &quot;Torment&quot; with Marc Almond on the latter&#x27;s LP &quot;Torment and Toreros&quot; (by Marc and the Mambas). In 1985, he produced an EP of the Flowerpot Men, titled &quot;Jo&#x27;s so mean to Josephine&quot; which &quot;has become a proto-techno classic&quot;.

===The Glove===
Severin&#x27;s work outside the Banshees, in this period, is however most known for the Glove, his side project with the Cure&#x27;s (and then current Banshee guitarist) Robert Smith. They both started to compose material in 1982. During that era, Severin&#x27;s first studio 
recording with Smith was to record an early version of the Cure&#x27;s song &quot;Lament&quot; for &quot;Flexipop&quot; magazine. Severin then played bass again with the Cure for a one-off live TV appearance on BBC&#x27;s Riverside in January 1983, for a rendition of the song &quot;Siamese Twins&quot;. 

Severin and Smith composed a second block of songs for the Glove in early 1983. Severin came up with the name, the title and the blue/yellow sleeve concept. This led to the release of the album &quot;Blue Sunshine&quot; and two attendant singles. The album reached number 35 in the UK albums chart in 1983 and the single &quot;Like an Animal&quot; peaked just outside the UK top 50. The next single from the album, &quot;Punish Me with Kisses&quot;, only just made it into the top 100. Though Smith did sing on a few tracks, the featured vocalist is Jeanette Landray – a friend of Banshee drummer Budgie who was at the time involved in progressing a musical relationship with Siouxsie under the Creatures banner. The album is noted for its low-level musical interludes between tracks.

Musically close enough to the differing Cure and Banshee styles to attract large sections of both sets of fans, the more experimental nature and references to 1960&#x27;s psychedelia and pop-art also attracted a more eclectic audience. The use of keyboards and synthesizers, as well as the inclusion of instrumental only tracks, were also an early pointer to Severin&#x27;s post Banshee musical output.

===Solo work: 1989–present===
Severin&#x27;s post-Banshees output was the &quot;Visions of Ecstasy&quot; soundtrack, created for the Nigel Wingrove short film interpretation of the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila. This 1989 sensual fantasy film remained unreleased until 2012, as it has been refused a certificate on the grounds of blasphemy – the only film so banned by The British Board of Film Classification. The four parts written by Severin for the soundtrack, &quot;Sphere&quot;, &quot;Come Deliver Us&quot;, &quot;Skin Crawl&quot; and &quot;Transverberation of the Heart&quot;, formed the basis of his first post-Banshees release. Almost 10 years after creating the &quot;Visions of Ecstasy&quot; soundtrack, Severin released an album entitled &quot;Visions&quot;, featuring four tracks derived from the original pieces written for the film, plus another five instrumentals. Severin completely reworked the soundtrack – originally eighteen minutes long – into a forty-five-minute ambient album. It was also the first release by Severin&#x27;s RE: records label. The record also featured Banshees&#x27; cello player and keyboardist Martin McCarrick. &quot;Visions&quot; was first only available via his website and was then distributed by Cargo.

In 1999, Severin released &quot;Maldoror&quot;. The origins for this instrumental album were as far back as 1993, when Severin wrote some tracks for Brazilian Theatre Company &quot;Os Satyros&quot; production of Lautréamont&#x27;s &quot;Chants of Maldoror&quot;. After losing and regaining contact with the group, Severin composed further pieces for the 1998 production &quot;Os Cantos des Maldoror&quot;. These pieces were collected together and released on CD. That same year, Severin had been invited to be musical director for the Canadian dance company &quot;Holy Body Tattoo&quot; on &quot;CIRCA&quot; – described as a 70-minute multimedia &quot;celebration of the sensual forces of submission and control&quot; – a postmodern deconstruction of the tango that interwove film footage by William Morrison and original music by Severin, Warren Ellis and cult cabaret trio The Tiger Lillies. The music from CIRCA was largely drawn from Martyn Jacques and company&#x27;s album &quot;Circus Songs&quot;. Severin contributed keyboards and also produced this album for the Tiger Lillies.

Severin&#x27;s third RE: release, &quot;The Woman in the Dunes&quot; was specially commissioned by Shakti and the Vasanta Mala dance company to accompany the stage production of the Kōbō Abe novel of the same name. It premiered at the ICA in the summer of 2000. The only vocal included is &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;; a version of the Screaming Jay Hawkins classic sung by Jarboe (ex Swans).

Severin returned to composing soundtracks, and in 2003 film director Robert Pratten approached Severin to compose the soundtrack for his first film, a British independent supernatural thriller called &quot;London Voodoo&quot;. The film contained four tracks that Severin collaborated on with his wife and songwriting partner Arban, under the name &quot;Darling Hate&quot;. As a result of this new direction, Severin wound down his RE: label to concentrate on writing for film and television.

&quot;London Voodoo&quot; was followed by a soundtrack for &quot;The Purifiers&quot;, the second film feature by Richard Jobson, which premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2004. The tracks extensively used in the score were &quot;Enter Into These Bonds&quot; from &quot;Visions&quot; and &quot;Prelude:Europa&quot; from &quot;Maldoror&quot;.

In 2005, Severin released another album based on a soundtrack originally commissioned by the Indo/Japanese performer Shakti in August 2003 for her interpretation of the story of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. The album &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is credited to Arban and Steven Severin. It was the first release on their Subconscious Music label. Though jointly credited, the 50-minute score was created in an original manner which owed much to the circumstances in producing it. As it was commissioned to accompany a dance production, the titles and timing of each individual part was already decided upon by Shakti, who also suggested the theme for each piece. Owing to other commitments upon their time, it was decided by Arban and Severin that each would work on alternating pieces individually. Arban Severin took responsibility for the odd-numbered tracks and Severin for the others. After a piece was substantially completed it was given over to the other partner to review and to make contributions. Only when both parties were satisfied was the track considered finished.

This method of working was renewed for the following project, the soundtrack for director Paul Burrow&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Nature Morte&quot; (Still Life). This film score recording was released on 16 October 2006, again under the Subconscious Music label. In the mid-2000s, Severin left London and moved to Scotland to reside in Edinburgh.

In 2008, Severin started composing scores for silent films of the 1920s and 1930s, the first being Germaine Dulac’s &quot;The Seashell and the Clergyman&quot;: he also made scores for 6 short films and got in contact with Picturehouse, to play in their cinemas in the UK. The first &quot;Music for Silents&quot; show was done in May.

In 2009, Severin and Arban scored director Matthew Mishory&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;, a tribute to Steven&#x27;s old friend Derek Jarman. The film has been permanently installed in the British Film Institute&#x27;s National Film Archive, in the special collection Beautiful Things, &quot;a major collection of over 100 films and television programmes that chronicle and explore queer representation and identities over the last century&quot;.

In 2010 Severin released his debut album for Cold Spring titled &quot;Blood of a Poet&quot;. The album is a recording of his soundtrack for a 1930 silent movie by Jean Cocteau which was screened alongside his live performance at Montreal&#x27;s Fantasia festival. After the premiere of the tour performed at The Hollywood Silent Film Theatre in Los Angeles, a UK tour took place in autumn 2010.

In 2011, Severin and Arban renewed their collaboration with filmmaker Matthew Mishory, scoring his feature film &quot;Joshua Tree, 1951: A Portrait of James Dean&quot;: the film would be released a couple of years later. That year, Severin also composed a score to Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Vampyr&quot;; it was his second collaboration with the label Cold Spring. &quot;Vampyr&quot; was the longest score he ever attempted. It completed a trilogy that had started with &quot;The Seashell &amp; The Clergyman&quot; then &quot;Blood of a Poet&quot;. He then went on tour in Europe in 2012.

After a hiatus of several years, he released in March 2017 via his website a 6-track album &quot;The Vril Harmonies&quot;, followed in April by another 8-track album &quot;Innocence and Blood&quot; and &quot;#002FA7 (International Klein Blue)&quot;. In 2019, a 23 minute track titled &quot;23 Wounds Of Julius Caesar (reincarnation)&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Jhon Balance (co-founder of the group Coil) and Peter Christopherson (of Throbbing Gristle).

In 2024, he released &quot;The Orphanage&quot;, which was &quot;a new name for my compilation of homeless tracks. It incorporates &quot;Unisexdreamsalon&quot; and adds a further 8 previously unreleased, unheard tracks. [...] All good things&quot;. Other releases such as 
&quot;Black Matter for the King&quot;, &quot;The Bedlam Variations&quot; and &quot;Bunny Yeager is Missing&quot; followed.

==Influences and style==
After first seeing Paul McCartney at an early age, the first bass player who impressed him was Jack Bruce. Then in the early 1970s, Can&#x27;s Holger Czukay became his bass hero. 

Severin played bass in an unusual way, hitting strings upside down with a guitar pick, from bottom to top. He commented: &quot;It just came naturally. Moving slowly up and down seems so passive to me considering the music was so aggressive. It&#x27;s also about the precision of every single note&quot;. &quot;Making Music&quot; noted that one of the band&#x27;s most distinctive elements was a &quot;thick heavy chordal bass style&quot;. Severin often played &quot;three note chords and play triplets across them with the pick&quot;. When the band was a quartet, he and the guitarist tried to keep out of each other&#x27;s way: &quot;so that if John&#x27;s playing down the bottom I&#x27;ll play up the top... It&#x27;s basically about filling the whole musical space, but we have three instruments to do that&quot;.

Severin stated that on the two first Banshees albums, &quot;the bass had a sort of dynamic role, pushing and pumping&quot;. He then used different bass tunings. Consequently, there were a number of different bass guitars in the Banshees stage show, with different tunings. For certain songs, he tuned up two of the strings: &quot;so I could use a simple shape and play the thing I wanted to play. Then it led on to all the shapes I played on a normally tuned guitar giving me a whole catalogue of new songs&quot;. In 1986, he explained he played A/C/D/A# instead of E/A/D/G.

Commenting his work as film composer, he said: &quot; I dislike... signposts emotions... You just have to create a bed for the emotion that’s already there, to heighten it&quot;.

==Equipment==
Severin used in concert the Fender Jazz bass. He also played on a Music Man StingRay, mainly in studio but not so much on stage, as &quot;it tended not to be so thick-sounding&quot;. 

He used Ampeg SVTs and a rack full of choruses, flangers, and octave dividers.

==Writing==
In the late 1990s, Severin wrote several articles which were published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. In 2000, he published &quot;The Twelve Revelations&quot;; a collection of Severin&#x27;s erotic prose/poetry, illustrated with line drawings by Catharyne Ward.

==Personal life==
Severin is married and is the father of two children.

<doc id="1112070" wikidata="Q565628" url="?curid=1112070" title="Alexander Ypsilantis (1725–1805)">
<text>Alexander Ypsilantis ( &quot;Alexandros Ypsilantis&quot;, ; 1726 – 13 January 1807) was a Greek Voivode (Prince) of Wallachia from 1774 to 1782, and again from 1796 to 1797, and also Voivode of Moldavia from 1786 to 1788. He bears the same name as, but should not be confused with, his grandson, the Greek War of Independence hero of the early 19th century. The Ypsilantis were a prominent family of Phanariotes.

==Reign==
In 1774, as a diplomat in service to the Porte, Ypsilanti took part in the signing of the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji with Russia; a year later, he was rewarded for this and other services by being appointed Dragoman of the Porte. Still in 1775, he was awarded the throne of Wallachia. This could only happen as the Russian troops were ending their occupation of Bucharest, begun in 1771. The throne had been vacant throughout this period, a hiatus provoked by Emanuel Giani Ruset&#x27;s agreement with Catherine II at the start of the war.

As principal acts of his reign in Wallachia, Ypsilanti enforced a series of reforms. Several laws are grouped in the &quot;Pravilniceasca condică&quot;, called &quot;Syntagmation nomikon&quot; in its Greek version (roughly: &quot;The Code of Byzantine customary laws&quot;). Issued in 1780, the Code sought to amend fiscal, administrative, judicial and political flaws. During his judicial reform, Ipsilanti created civil courts in each Wallachian county. What was in fact a radical redefinition of legal boundaries had to make occasional reference to Byzantine norms (the traditional laws in the two Principalities), due to resistance from conservative boyars in the Assembly (the Sfat). Most notably, the new laws tried to impose salaries for public offices, a measure intended to reduce fiscal burdens on the taxed social categories (that had been supposed to provide revenues for the fiscal agents, usually boyars, in an economy in which land ownership had become less of an asset than holding office) and ensure a more professional administrative structure.
Ypsilanti&#x27;s reigns coincide with a critical moment in Ottoman history. In August 1787, Russia resumed hostilities (see Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)), and the Porte faced a large-scale invasion of its Danubian territories as the Habsburg Empire joined the fighting (9 February 1788). A secondary effect of this event was the granting of military command over Turkish troops in the region to Ypsilanti: the gesture is also significant as a temporary re-shaping of status in the relations between Prince and Sultan for the context of Phanariote rule.

Sources suggest that Ypsilanti was considering an alliance with Austria, and had been negotiating with emissaries of Emperor Joseph II. However, as the Austrians occupied Iaşi in April, all contacts ceased and the Prince was kept in custody in Brno up to the signing of the peace treaty at Sistowa (autumn of 1791).

<text>A degree completion program is an undergraduate academic program, most frequently found in the United States and Canada, that is offered within an established university but designed for non-traditional students.
Degree completion programs are typically structured to allow persons who previously completed a substantial portion of the requirements for an undergraduate degree, but who have been separated from the university setting for a period of time, to complete the credit requirements needed to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree (B.A.), either at an accelerated pace, or a flexible schedule. The difference between credits previously earned, and those required for the award of a B.A., are made-up through a variety of methods depending on the sponsoring institution, but typically include a combination of traditional university courses and CLEP examinations.

==Examples== 
* Georgetown University bills its degree completion program as designed for students who were &quot;meaning to complete&quot; their bachelor&#x27;s degree, but for whom &quot;life, work and other obligations got in the way&quot;. Applications are accepted from working adults who have completed one or two years of university courses which can be transferred onto the potential student&#x27;s Georgetown transcript. A series of evening and weekend classes fills the gap between credits earned and those required for a bachelor&#x27;s degree.
* The degree completion program at the University of the Pacific is open to applicants who have completed 70-credits of university level course work. Once enrolled, students take a twice-weekly, evening class over the course of four semesters; those who successfully complete the 15-month instructional sequence are awarded a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies.
* Colorado State University offers a degree completion program in psychology. Students can transfer up to 90 credits of coursework taken at another university before completing the final 30 credits required for a B.A. degree through distance learning psychology courses at Colorado State.
* University of San Francisco offers a Bachelor of Science in Management to working professionals who are interested in completing their degree. Students who have completed at least 60 semester credits may apply to the program and can earn their degree in as little as 23 months. Students take two courses each semester, and studies include accounting, finance, marketing, organizational behavior and theory, analytics, technology, logistics, and other core competencies.
* University of Nebraska–Lincoln offers an online Bachelor of Science degree completion program in applied science. Students select from a broad range of courses across the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, in addition to the credits they&#x27;ve already earned, to tailor a degree to their career goals. This program provides a convenient and flexible career path for those in the military, currently employed, returning to college or transferring from a two-year college.

<doc id="1112079" wikidata="Q7054626" url="?curid=1112079" title="North Carolina Supreme Court">
<text>The Supreme Court of the State of North Carolina is the state of North Carolina&#x27;s highest appellate court. Until the creation of the North Carolina Court of Appeals in the 1960s, it was the state&#x27;s only appellate court. The Supreme Court consists of six associate justices and one chief justice, although the number of justices has varied. The primary function of the Supreme Court is to decide questions of law that have arisen in the lower courts and before state administrative agencies.

==History==
The state of North Carolina&#x27;s first constitution, adopted in 1776, permitted the North Carolina General Assembly to appoint &quot;Judges of the Supreme Courts of Law and Equity&quot;, but no appellate court was created for several years. The first one was the Court of Conference, established in 1799, consisting of several North Carolina Superior Court judges sitting &quot;en banc&quot; twice each year to review appeals from their courts. In 1805, the General Assembly renamed the institution the &quot;Supreme Court&quot;, but left its composition the same. Five years later a law was passed empowering the governor to provide an official seal and motto for the court and granting the right of appeal to all parties in cases adjudicated by the Superior Court. The law also stipulated that the judges should record their decisions in writing and read them in court and permitted them to elect a chief justice from among their ranks. John Louis Taylor was selected as the first chief justice.

In 1818, the General Assembly approved a bill proposed by State Senator William Gaston to create a distinct, independent Supreme Court with exclusive appellate jurisdiction over questions of law and equity arising from Superior Court cases. The court comprised three judges appointed by the General Assembly, with the judges to select a chief justice from among their number. Judges were salaried and served indefinitely &quot;during good behavior&quot;. Interim vacancies were to be filled by the governor with the advice of the Council of State. The first judges were Taylor, Leonard Henderson, and John Hall. Henderson and Hall made Taylor chief justice, and the court held its first meeting on January 1, 1819. Eventually, it shifted to a schedule of sitting for two terms annually, with the first beginning on beginning on the second Monday in June and the second on the last Monday in December.

From 1819 until it burnt down in 1831, the court met in the North Carolina State Capitol in Raleigh. After the fire, the court briefly convened in the meeting house of the First Presbyterian Church until the capitol was rebuilt. Growing Jacksonian sentiment in North Carolina throughout the 1820s and 1830s generated populist anger towards the court, with many citizens feeling the institution was distant from the people and that the judges were over-compensated. Populist legislators introduced a measure to reduce the judges&#x27; salaries in 1832 and a constitutional amendment to abolish the court in 1835, but such actions did not succeed. Legal scholar Martin H. Brinkley attributed the court&#x27;s survival to &quot;the personal prestige of the judges themselves&quot;, particularly Thomas Ruffin and Gaston, who respectively joined the court in 1829 and 1833.

In 1846, the General Assembly passed a law requiring the court hold a term in Morganton every year to ease travel burdens for lawyers in the western portion of the state. The court had no access to a law library during its stay in the city, and many lawyers later criticized the decisions made there for being deficient. The justices stopped traveling to Morganton after the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. They conducted little business during the war.

After the war, the state of North Carolina adopted a new constitution in 1868. The overhauled judicial article prescribed the creation of a Supreme Court comprising five judges, namely one chief justice and four associate justices, all to be popularly-elected to serve eight-year terms. The governor was responsible for filling interim vacancies on the court pending the holding of the next state legislative election.

During the Reconstruction era, the court&#x27;s membership was dominated by Republicans, though as the era waned in the latter portion of the 19th century, conservative Democrats became a majority on the court. In 1876, the constitution was amended to shrink the court&#x27;s membership to three justices. This burdened the court&#x27;s members with a heavy workload, and after the apparent death of Justice Thomas Samuel Ashe from stress, the constitution was amended to restore the court to its previous size in 1888. Beginning that year, the Supreme Court met in buildings located along the periphery of Union Square in Raleigh. In 1900, the Supreme Court ruled a law passed by the 1899 Democratic-dominated legislature was unconstitutional. In response, in 1901, the North Carolina House of Representatives voted to impeach Republican Chief Justice David M. Furches and Associate Justice Robert M. Douglas for issuing a supposedly unconstitutional mandamus directing the state treasurer to disburse money. The Senate failed to convict them with the two-thirds majority necessary to convict and remove them, leaving them to serve out their terms in office.

In 1936, North Carolina&#x27;s constitution was amended to provide for the Supreme Court to comprise a chief justice and at most six associate justices. The following year, the General Assembly empowered the governor to appoint two additional associate justices, thus allowing the court to expand to seven justices. In September 1940, the court moved into the new Justice Building near the State Capitol. The North Carolina Court of Appeals was created as an intermediate appellate court in 1967 in part to help ease the workload of the Supreme Court.

The General Assembly made Supreme Court elections non-partisan starting with the 2004 elections, but later made them partisan again after the 2016 elections.

Susie Sharp became the court&#x27;s first female justice in 1962. She became its first female chief justice in 1974. Henry Frye became the first black justice in 1983. In 2011, the court had a female majority for the first time.

In October 1975, the court adopted a new official seal, amending the Latin phrase Suum cuique to Suum cuique tribuere.

== Function ==
=== Jurisdiction ===
The Supreme Court, along with the Court of Appeals, constitute the Appellate Division within North Carolina&#x27;s unified court system, the General Court of Justice. The primary function of the Supreme Court is to decide questions of law that have arisen in the lower courts and before state administrative agencies. The court&#x27;s docket is typically dominated by cases concerning interpretation of the constitution, major legal questions, and appeals of criminal cases involving capital punishment. First-degree murder convictions entailing capital sentences reached in trial courts are automatically scheduled for the court&#x27;s review, as are cases involving North Carolina Utilities Commission rate determinations. The court is also required by law to examine all non-unanimous Court of Appeals decisions and may at its discretion hear appeals concerning unanimous decisions of the court. It has the power to depublish Court of Appeals decisions, thus allowing a lower ruling to stand but preventing it from forming legal precedent.

The court&#x27;s sole original jurisdiction is over cases of judicial discipline heard on the recommendation of the Judicial Standards Commission. It may, at its discretion, chose to hear direct appeals from trial courts without them first being brought before the Court of Appeals, if the court determines that a case involves a significant public interest, raises questions of major legal principles, or if a delay in its resolution would risk great harm. Justices of the court also sometimes issue advisory opinions in response to questions of law brought by officials in the executive and legislative branches.

=== Session ===
The Supreme Court is constitutionally required to meet in Raleigh, unless directed otherwise by the General Assembly. State law permits the court to hold sessions in Morganton and Edenton. The court and its staff are housed in the Justice Building at 2 East Morgan Street in Raleigh. The justices sit for proceedings in a courtroom on the third floor.

=== Administrative responsibilities ===
The justices appoint their own court clerk, librarian, and reporter. The chief justice of the court is responsible for appointing the director of the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts, the chief administrative law judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings, the chief judge of the Court of Appeals, and the chief district court judges in each North Carolina District Courts district. A justice of the court is required by the constitution to administer the oath of office to an incoming governor. As the head of the state&#x27;s General Court of Justice, the Supreme Court schedules the sessions of the North Carolina Superior Court, and is responsible for adopting the statewide Code of Judicial Conduct, which regulates the behavior of judges in the state.

=== Impeachments and removal ===
In the event the governor or lieutenant governor is impeached by the North Carolina House of Representatives, the chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the impeachment trial in the North Carolina Senate. Justices of the Supreme Court can also be impeached and removed by the legislature.

== Court composition ==
The Supreme Court consists of one chief justice and six associate justices. In the event the chief justice is temporarily unavailable, the senior associate justice may assume their responsibilities. The constitution permits the General Assembly to add up to two additional associate justices. Justices are popularly elected and serve eight-year terms. All candidates for election or appointment to the court must be licensed to practice law in the state.

<text>Miló of Narbonne (fl. 752–782) was the Count of Narbonne, who was ruling in 752, successor probably of Gilbert. It seems that he was in favour of the Franks, but, as there was a Muslim garrison in Narbonne, he didn&#x27;t follow Ansemund, Count of Nimes in his allegiance to the Frankish Kingdom. The Goth counts and the Franks started to besiege Narbonne. Miló left the city toward Trausse, near Caunes, awaiting the result of the struggle. The Muslim troop resisted for about seven years. Narbonne capitulated in 759 and then the Frankish granted the county to Miló.

During the reign of the juvenile King Louis the Pious of Aquitaine in 782, Miló took advantage of the absence of the archbishop Daniel of Narbonne, who was on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, to claim certain fiefs as his own. Despite having persuaded Charlemagne initially, Miló was compelled to make restitutions to Daniel after Arluin, curator of the diocese, brought suit against him.

<doc id="1112084" wikidata="Q1283218" url="?curid=1112084" title="Greengage">
<text>The greengages are a group of cultivars of the common Middle Eastern plum. The first true greengage came from a green-fruited wild plum which originated in Iran. Greengages are grown in temperate areas and are known for the rich, confectionery flavour. They are considered to be among the finest dessert plums.

==Description==
Greengage fruit are identified by their round-oval shape and smooth-textured, pale green flesh; they are on average smaller than round plums but larger than mirabelle plums—usually between diameter. The skin ranges in colour from green to yellowish, with a pale blue &quot;blush&quot; in some cultivars; a few Reine Claudes, such as &#x27;Graf Althanns&#x27;, are reddish-purple due to crossbreeding with other plums.

==Taxonomy==
Greengage fruit originated in the Middle East. Though &quot;Green Gages&quot; were previously thought to have been first imported into England from France in 1724 by Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet, a greengage seed was found embedded in a 15th-century building in Hereford. Supposedly, the labels identifying the French plum trees were lost in transit to Gage&#x27;s home at Hengrave Hall, near Bury St Edmunds. More recent research indicates that it was a cousin and namesake Sir William Gage, 2nd Baronet of Hengrave who was responsible for introducing the greengage to England.

The name &quot;Reine Claude&quot; (French for &quot;Queen Claude&quot;), by which they are known in France, is in honour of the French queen Claude (1499–1524), Duchess of Brittany. A greengage is also called (French for &quot;the good Queen&quot;) in France.

Although the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; regards &quot;gage&quot; and &quot;greengage&quot; as synonyms, not all gages are green, and some horticulturists make a distinction between the two words, with greengages as a variety of the gages, as &quot;Prunus domestica&quot; subsp. &quot;italica&quot; var. &quot;claudiana&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Greengages are widely grown in particular in western Europe. The core of their range extends from France to southern England. In Germany, where they are called or &quot;Ringlotte&quot;, numerous cultivars have been developed too. In the Czech Republic, they are known as , in Poland as , in Hungary as , in Slovakia as , in Slovenia as , and in Portugal as . They are widely grown, typically for eating out of hand or stewing in syrup to make a compote. In Portugal, however, they make up a delicacy invented by Dominican nuns in the 16th or 17th century (when confined to their convents) in the town of Elvas, where they are boiled in a sugary syrup several times, over the course of several weeks, to then be preserved whole in syrup or dried, coated in sugar and eaten either with a local dessert, &quot;sericaia&quot;, made from eggs, sugar, milk, cinnamon and flour or eaten with rich cheeses. 

At least the green cultivars breed more or less true from seed. Several similar cultivars produced from seedlings are now available; some of these include other plum cultivars in their parentage. Widely grown cultivars include:

* &quot;Gojeh Sabz&quot; (Iran)
* (Turkey)
* &quot;Boddarts Reneclode&quot; (Germany)
* &quot;Bryanston&quot; (UK)
* &quot;Cambridge Gage&quot; (UK)
* &quot;Denniston&#x27;s Superb&quot; (US)
* or &quot;Göy Alça&quot; (Azerbaijan)
* &quot;Golden Transparent&quot; (UK)
* &quot;Graf Althanns Reneklode&quot; (Germany)
* &quot;Green Vanilla&quot; (Mount Pelion, Greece)
* &quot;Große Grüne Reneklode&quot; (Germany) / &quot;Reine Claude Verte&quot; (France)
* &quot;Laxton&#x27;s Gage&quot; (UK)
* &quot;Laxton&#x27;s Supreme&quot; (UK)
* &quot;Meroldts Reneclode&quot; (Germany)

* &quot;Rainha Cláudia&quot; (Portugal)
* (Italy)
* &quot;Reine Claude de Bavay&quot; (France)
* &quot;Reine Claude d&#x27;Oullins&quot; (France)
* &quot;Uhinks Reneklode&quot; (Germany)
* &quot;Washington&quot; (US)
==Uses==
They are considered to be among the finest dessert plums; Anna Pavord calls them &quot;most ambrosial of all tree fruit&quot; and David Karp describes them as &quot;the best fruit in the world&quot;.

==In culture==
Greengages were cultivated in the American colonies, being grown on the plantations of American presidents George Washington (1732–1799) and Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826).

The fruit is referenced in the British novel &quot;The Greengage Summer&quot; (1958) by Rumer Godden, which was adapted into a film in 1961.

Greengages are mentioned in a &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; sketch as a form of dangerous fruit (as in a food fight).

More recently, the tree features in the novel &quot;The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree&quot; (2017) by Iranian-Australian author Shokoofeh Azar.

<text>Clapham is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Bedford in Bedfordshire, England. It had a population of 3,643 as at the 2001 census, increasing to 4,560 at the 2011 Census.

==Points of interest==
RAF Twinwood Farm, a disused airfield on the western outskirts of the village, is where the famous bandleader Glenn Miller took off on his last fateful flight, having performed for the American soldiers based at the airfield (51 Operational Training Unit ROYAL AIR FORCE was the main unit based at Twinwood Farm) and at Bedford Corn Exchange. The Glenn Miller Museum is now open on site with many events taking place during the summer months.

Clapham Park, a large new country house, was built by James Howard, member of parliament for Bedford, in 1872.

There is also a derelict Italian POW camp, which is now owned by a farmer and has been the victim of graffiti artists and an abandoned caravan beside the parish Church.
==Sport and recreation==
Clapham has a King George V Field in memorial to King George V. Recently, Towers Gymnasium and Health Club has been built on the road between Clapham and Bedford. It has a Swimming Pool, Sauna, Tennis court and gym equipment.

Twinwoods hosts an annual Folk Music Festival, called the Twinwoods Festival, typically over the August Bank Holiday weekend.

<doc id="1112088" wikidata="Q16153233" url="?curid=1112088" title="1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal">
<text>The 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal, colloquially known as the Triple Six Fix, was a successful plot to rig &quot;The Daily Number&quot;, a three-digit game of the Pennsylvania Lottery. All of the balls in the three machines, except those numbered &quot;4&quot; and &quot;6&quot;, were weighted, meaning that the drawing was almost sure to be a combination of those digits. The scheme was successful in that &quot;666&quot; (one of the eight combinations of 4s and 6s that the &quot;fixers&quot; were hoping for) was drawn on April 24, 1980; however, the unusual betting patterns alerted authorities to the crime. The chief conspirators were sent to prison, and most of the fraudulently acquired winnings were never paid out.

==Planning==

The plan was masterminded by Nick Perry (1916–2003), &quot;The Daily Number&quot;″s announcer. Perry was born Nicholas Pericles Katsafanas in the Morningside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended Peabody High School and Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. After serving in the U.S. Navy in World War II, Perry began a career as a radio broadcaster in Charleston, West Virginia, then entered television broadcasting on Pittsburgh&#x27;s WDTV, the forerunner of KDKA-TV. Perry later moved over to rival WTAE-TV in 1958, as a staff announcer. Later, he became a news and weather reporter and was the host of local sports shows like &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot; and &quot;Championship Bowling&quot;. In 1977, Perry became the host of the live nightly broadcast of the Pennsylvania Lottery, held in the studios of WTAE.

Perry first discussed his idea with Jack and Peter Maragos, two of his partners in a vending machine business. Once committed to the plan, Perry approached local Pittsburgh lettering expert and WTAE art director Joseph Bock about creating weighted ping-pong balls that were replicas of the official balls used in the lottery machines. The No. 4 and No. 6 balls were chosen as the &quot;lucky&quot; lighter balls.

Perry got access to the machines and ping-pong balls, which had been kept in a room at WTAE studios, through Edward Plevel, a lottery official. The room was locked with two keys; Perry had one, and Plevel had the other. Plevel left the machines and balls unguarded for several minutes on a few occasions. Perry also got WTAE stagehand Fred Luman to physically switch the original balls with the weighted ones twice: once before and once after the drawing. Bock then took the rigged balls back to his studio and burned them in a paint can a half-hour after the on-air drawing was done.

==Drawing==
Perry was the host of &quot;The Daily Number&quot; on April 24, 1980, when the drawing produced the number &quot;666&quot; for a then-record payout of $3.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ), including $1.18 million (equivalent to $ million in ) that went to eight people in on the scam.

Lottery authorities and local bookmakers became suspicious when they noticed that a large number of tickets were purchased for the eight possible combinations, and a handful of players came forward to claim the prize.

On the date of the drawing, the Maragos brothers traveled around Pennsylvania buying large quantities of tickets containing the eight possible numbers. The investigation was broken open when an anonymous tip led to a bar near Philadelphia where the brothers had bought a large number of lottery tickets. An employee remembered the brothers coming into the bar with a platinum-blonde woman and laying down a large amount of cash to buy lottery tickets, all on the eight specific numbers. The employee recalled that while he printed the tickets, one of the brothers made a pay phone call, spoke in a foreign language, and held up the phone so the listener could hear the lottery machine printing the tickets.

Investigators pulled the phone records and traced the call to the WTAE-TV announcer&#x27;s booth in the studio where the drawing was done. This strongly implicated Perry, and Maragos confirmed under questioning that the conversation had been with Perry (in Greek). Further investigation and questioning of the Maragos brothers eventually implicated the rest of the conspirators. William Moran of Fairmont, West Virginia, organized the out-of-state buying of additional lottery tickets for a numbers-running scam.

It was later revealed that the Maragos brothers also placed bets on the eight numbers with local bookmakers who had illegal numbers games that used the lottery drawing as the winning result. The brothers also told friends and family which numbers to play. All of this may have contributed to the conspiracy&#x27;s downfall, with the greater influx of slanted bets.

==Aftermath==
A grand jury was assembled and charges were leveled against all seven men. Plevel was convicted and spent two years in prison. Bock, Luman, and Moran pleaded guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. The Maragos brothers avoided jail time by agreeing to testify against Perry. Much of the $1.8 million ($ today) was recovered from the Maragos brothers, as were numerous lottery tickets.

Perry was convicted of criminal conspiracy, criminal mischief, theft by deception, rigging a publicly exhibited contest and perjury on May 20, 1981. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. He served two years at State Correctional Institution – Camp Hill and spent another year at a halfway house in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Perry remained on parole until March 1989. He held a number of jobs after prison including an unsuccessful attempt to return to broadcasting in the late 1980s. Perry died in Attleboro, Massachusetts, on April 22, 2003, having never admitted to any role in the plot.

After the scandal, the Pennsylvania Lottery and other drawings began taking greater precautions to guard against rigging. The drawings for the Lottery were moved from WTAE to WHP-TV in the state capital of Harrisburg on June 29, 1981, on orders of Governor Dick Thornburgh who made the announcement on June 10, 1981, along with the addition of a &quot;security chief&quot; and background checks on all staff related to the drawings. The Pittsburgh market broadcasting rights were given to KDKA-TV in 1981 as well. In Harrisburg, despite the drawings now being held at PBS affiliate WITF-TV, they air locally on rival station WGAL, which has been a sister station to WTAE since it was acquired by Hearst from Pulitzer in 1999. It was not until July 1, 2009, that the Lottery resumed airing on WTAE, where the drawings remained until July 1, 2015, when WPXI took over.

===In popular culture===
The 2000 film &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot;, starring John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow, was loosely based on Perry&#x27;s story.

In 2006, Game Show Network aired a documentary in their &quot;Anything to Win&quot; series about the scandal, complete with anecdotes from former WTAE and KDKA news anchor Don Cannon. The 2013 episode &quot;The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Baby&quot; from &quot;Castle&quot;″s sixth season is loosely based on the scandal. In 2011, a season 2 episode of &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; briefly features the story.

Case photographs, artifacts, and information can be viewed at the Pennsylvania State Police Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

<text>is the pseudonym of , a well-known director of anime. He works frequently with the animation studio Madhouse (which he co-founded), though he is a freelance director not employed directly by any one studio. He began working in the animation industry—at age 17—as an in-between animator on the 1958 film &quot;Hakujaden&quot;. His works have won and been nominated for multiple awards, including a nomination for Best Film (&quot;Metropolis&quot;) at the 2001 Festival de Cine de Sitges.

Rintaro is a fan of science fiction, and has been influenced by American westerns, gangster films, film noir, and French films. Additionally, he was influenced by Osamu Tezuka, and worked with him on &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; and &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. He said that when he was making &quot;Metropolis&quot;, which was based on Tezuka&#x27;s manga of the same name, he &quot;wanted to communicate Tezuka&#x27;s spirit&quot;. Rintaro personally introduced the film at the Big Apple Anime Fest in 2001, where it was screened before its theatrical release by TriStar Pictures.

Rintaro has also worked under the name Kuruma Hino, in addition to his best known pseudonym and his birth name. His pseudonym is sometimes miswritten as Rin Taro or Taro Rin. He is a founding member of the Japanese Animation Creators Association (JAniCA) labor group.

==Biography==
Rintaro was born in Tokyo. His first job in the animation industry was as an in-between animator on the 1958 film &quot;Hakujaden&quot;, which he worked on while working at Toei Animation. After working on two additional films there, he began working for Mushi Productions, the studio run by Osamu Tezuka. His first directing job was the fourth episode of the 1963 series &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. After leaving Mushi in 1971 to become a freelancer, he worked on many TV series and films, and established himself as one of the most respected and well-known anime directors in Japan.

In recent years, Rintaro has lectured at Kyoto Seika University.

In 2023, a short film directed by Rintaro, &quot;Yamanaka Sadao ni Sasageru Manga Eiga &#x27;Nezumikozō Jirokichi″&quot;, premiered at the 1st Niigata International Animation Film Festival.

Rintaro&#x27;s brother, Masayuki Hayashi, is himself an anime director and animator with credits including &quot;Wandering Sun&quot;, &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, &quot;Combattler V&quot; and several Tatsunoko productions including &quot;Kerokko Demetan&quot;, &quot;Dash Kappei&quot;, &quot;The Littl&#x27; Bits&quot;, and &quot;Okawari Boy Starzan S&quot;. Some sources, including &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot;, erroneously claim that &quot;Masayuki Hayashi&quot; and &quot;Rintaro&quot; are one and the same.

<text>The North Carolina Court of Appeals (in case citation, N.C. Ct. App.) is the only intermediate appellate court in the state of North Carolina. It is composed of fifteen members who sit in rotating panels of three. The Court of Appeals was created by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1967 after voters approved a constitutional amendment in 1965 which &quot;authorized the creation of an intermediate court of appeals to relieve pressure on the North Carolina Supreme Court.&quot;

Judges serve eight-year terms and are elected in statewide elections. The General Assembly made Court of Appeals elections non-partisan starting with the 2004 elections, but later made them partisan again after the 2016 elections.

== History ==
The creation of a Court of Appeals in North Carolina was first authorized by a constitutional amendment in 1965, but did not occur until a statute was made effective on January 1, 1967.

== Function ==
The Court of Appeals, along with the Supreme Court, constitute the Appellate Division within North Carolina&#x27;s unified court system, the General Court of Justice. Its structure is determined by statute.

The court comprises 15 members, with one designated as a chief judge by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina. Judges of the court are elected in statewide races to serve eight-year terms. Judges of the court convene in three member panels to hear cases. Rulings of one panel are binding upon other panels of the court and lower courts and can only be overruled by the Supreme Court.

<text>Assortative mating (also referred to as positive assortative mating or homogamy) is a mating pattern and a form of sexual selection in which individuals with similar phenotypes or genotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern. 

A majority of the phenotypes that are subject to assortative mating are body size, visual signals (e.g. color, pattern), and sexually selected traits such as crest size. 

The opposite of assortative is disassortative mating, also referred to &quot;negative assortative mating&quot;, in which case its opposite is termed &quot;positive assortative mating&quot;.

== Causes ==

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of assortative mating. Assortative mating has evolved from a combination of different factors, which vary across different species.

Assortative mating with respect to body size can arise as a consequence of intrasexual competition. In some species, size is correlated with fecundity in females. Therefore, males choose to mate with larger females, with the larger males defeating the smaller males in courting them. Examples of species that display this type of assortative mating include the jumping spider &quot;Phidippus clarus&quot; and the leaf beetle &quot;Diaprepes abbreviatus&quot;. In other cases, larger females are better equipped to resist male courtship attempts, and only the largest males are able to mate with them.

Assortative mating can, at times, arise as a consequence of social competition. Traits in certain individuals may indicate competitive ability which allows them to occupy the best territories. Individuals with similar traits that occupy similar territories are more likely to mate with one another. In this scenario, assortative mating does not necessarily arise from choice, but rather by proximity. This was noted in western bluebirds although there is no definite evidence that this is the major factor resulting in color dependent assortative mating in this species. Different factors may apply simultaneously to result in assortative mating in any given species.

== In non-human animals ==

Assortative mating in animals has been observed with respect to body size and color. Size-related assortative mating is prevalent across many species of vertebrates and invertebrates.
It has been found in the simultaneous hermaphrodites such as the land snail &quot;Bradybaena pellucida&quot;. One reason for its occurrence can be reciprocal intromission (i.e. both individuals provide both male and female gametes during a single mating) that happens in this species. Therefore, individuals with similar body size pair up with one another to facilitate this exchange. Moreover, it is known that larger individuals in such hermaphroditic species produce more eggs, so mutual mate choice is another factor leading to assortative mating in this species.

Evidence for size-related assortative mating has also been found in the mangrove snail, &quot;Littoraria ardouiniana&quot; and in the Japanese common toad, &quot;Bufo japonicus&quot;.

The second common type of assortative mating occurs with respect to coloration. This type of assortative mating is more common in socially monogamous bird species such as the eastern bluebirds (&quot;Sialia sialis&quot;) and western bluebirds (&quot;Sialia mexicana&quot;). In both species more brightly colored males mated with more brightly colored females and less brightly colored individuals paired with one another. Eastern bluebirds also mate assortatively for territorial aggression due to fierce competition for a limited number of nesting sites with tree swallows. Two highly aggressive individuals are better equipped to protect their nest, encouraging assortative mating between such individuals.

Assortative mating with respect to two common color morphs: striped and unstriped also exists in a polymorphic population of eastern red-backed salamanders (&quot;Plethodon cinereus&quot;).

Assortative mating is also found in many socially monogamous species of birds. Monogamous species are often involved in bi-parental care of their offspring. Since males are equally invested in the offspring as the mother, both genders are expected to display mate choice, a phenomenon termed as mutual mate choice. Mutual mate choice occurs when both males and females are searching for a mate that will maximize their fitness. In birds, female and male ornamentation can indicate better overall condition or such individuals might have better genes, or be better suited as parents.

== In humans ==

Assortative mating in humans has been widely observed and studied, and can be broken down into two types of human assortative mating. These are: 

* genetic assortative mating (assortative mating with mate choice based on genetic type and phenotypical expression); and
* social assortative mating (assortative mating with mate choice based on social, cultural, and other societal factors)

Genetic assortative mating is well studied and documented. In 1903 Pearson and colleagues reported strong correlations in height, span of arms, and the length of the left forearm between husband and wife in 1000 couples. Assortative mating with regards to appearance does not end there. Males prefer female faces that resemble their own when provided images of three women, with one image modified to resemble their own. However, the same result does not apply to females selecting male faces. Genetically related individuals (3rd or 4th cousin level) exhibit higher fitness than unrelated individuals.

Assortative mating based on genomic similarities plays a role in human marriages in the United States. Spouses are more genetically similar to each other than two randomly chosen individuals. The probability of marriage increases by roughly 15% for every one standard deviation increase in genetic similarity. However, some researchers argue that this assortative mating is caused purely by population stratification (the fact that people are more likely to marry within ethnic subgroups such as Swedish-Americans).

At the same time, individuals display disassortative mating for genes in the major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6. Individuals feel more attracted to odors of individuals who are genetically different in this region. This promotes MHC heterozygosity in the children, making them less vulnerable to pathogens. Apart from humans, disassortative mating with regards to the MHC coding region has been widely studied in mice, and has also been reported to occur in fish.

In addition to genetic assortative mating, humans also demonstrate patterns of assortative mating based on sociological factors as well. Sociological assortative mating is typically broken down into three categories, mate choice based on socio-economic status, mate choice based on racial or ethnic background, and mate choice based on religious beliefs.

Assortative mating based on socio-economic status is the broadest of these general categories. It includes the tendency of humans to prefer to mate within their socio-economic peers, that is, those with similar social standing, job prestige, educational attainment, or economic background as they themselves. This tendency has always been present in society: there was no historical area when most of the individuals preferred to sort, and had actually sorted, negatively into couples or matched randomly along these traits. Still, this tendency was weaker in some generations than in others. For instance, in the 20th century in the Western world, late Boomers had weaker aggregate preferences for educational homogamy than early Boomers had when being young adults; also, the members of the early Generation-X were typically much less &quot;picky&quot; about spousal education than the members of the late Generation-X were. This trend is evidenced by the search criteria of online dating site users.

Another form of sociological assortative mating is assortative mating based on racial and ethnic background. Mentioned above in the context of the genetically similar preferring to mate with one another, this form of assortative mating can take many varied and complicated forms. While the tendency mentioned above does exist, and people do tend to marry those genetically similar to themselves, especially if within the same racial or ethnic group, this trend can change in various ways. It is common, for example, for the barriers to intermarriage with the general population experienced by a minority population to decrease as the numbers of the minority population increase. This assimilation reduces the prevalence of this form of assortative mating. However, growth of a minority population does not necessarily lead to decreased barriers to intermarriage. This can be seen in the sharp increase in the non-white Hispanic population of the United States in the 1990s and 2000s that correlated with a sharp decrease in the percentage of non-white Hispanics intermarrying with the general population.

Religious assortative mating is the tendency of individuals to marry within their own religious group. This tendency is prevalent and observable, and changes according to three main factors. The first of these is the proportion of available spouses in the area who already follow the same religion as the person searching for a mate. Areas where religious beliefs are already similar for most people will always have high degrees of religious inbreeding. The second is the social distance between the intermarrying religious groups, or the physical proximity and social interactivity of these groups. Finally, the third factor is the personal views one holds towards marrying outside of a religion. Those who greatly value adherence to religious tradition may be more likely to be averse to marrying across religious lines. Although not necessarily religious, a good example of humans mating assortatively based on belief structure can be found in the tendency of humans to marry based on levels of charitable giving. Couples show similarities in terms of their contributions to public betterment and charities, and this can be attributed to mate choice based on generosity rather than phenotypic convergence.

Assortative mating also occurs among people with mental disorders such as ADHD, in which one person with ADHD is more likely to marry or have a child with another individual with ADHD.

== Effects ==
Assortative mating has reproductive consequences. Positive assortative mating increases genetic relatedness within a family, whereas negative assortative mating accomplishes the opposite effect. Either strategy may be employed by the individuals of a species depending upon which strategy maximizes fitness and enables the individuals to maximally pass on their genes to the next generation. For instance, in the case of eastern bluebirds, assortative mating for territorial aggression increases the probability of the parents obtaining and securing a nest site for their offspring. This in turn increases the likelihood of survival of the offspring and consequently fitness of the individuals. In birds whose coloration represents well being and fecundity of the bird, positive assortative mating for color increases the chances of genes being passed on and of the offspring being in good condition. Also, positive assortative mating for behavioral traits allows for more efficient communication between the individuals and they can cooperate better to raise their offspring.

On the other hand, mating between individuals of genotypes which are too similar allows for the accumulation of harmful recessive alleles, which can decrease fitness. Such mating between genetically similar individuals is termed inbreeding which can result in the emergence of autosomal recessive disorders. Moreover, assortative mating for aggression in birds can lead to inadequate parental care. An alternate strategy can be disassortative mating, in which one individual is aggressive and guards the nest site while the other individual is more nurturing and fosters the young; however, this risks the breakdown of coadapted gene complexes, leading to outbreeding depression. This division of labor increases the chances of survival of the offspring. A classic example of this is in the case of the white-throated sparrow (&quot;Zonotrichia albicollis&quot;). This bird exhibits two color morphs – white striped and tan striped. In both sexes, the white striped birds are more aggressive and territorial whereas tan striped birds are more engaged in providing parental care to their offspring. Therefore, disassortative mating in these birds allows for an efficient division of labor in terms of raising and protecting their offspring.

Positive assortative mating is a key element leading to reproductive isolation within a species, which in turn may result speciation in sympatry over time. Sympatric speciation is defined as the evolution of a new species without geographical isolation. Speciation from assortative mating has occurred in the Middle East blind mole rat, cicadas, and the European corn borer.

Like other animals, humans also display these genetic results of assortative mating. What makes humans unique, however, is the tendency towards seeking mates that are not only similar to them in genetics and in appearances, but those who are similar to them economically, socially, educationally, and culturally. These tendencies toward using sociological characteristics to select a mate has many effects on the lives and livelihoods of those who choose to marry one another, as well as their children and future generations. Within a generation, assortative mating is sometimes cited as a source of inequality, as those who mate assortatively would marry people of similar station to themselves, thus amplifying their current station. There is debate, however, about whether this growing preference for educational and occupational similarities in spouses is due to increased preferences for these traits or the shift in workload that occurred as women entered the workforce. This concentration of wealth in families also perpetuates across generations as parents pass their wealth on to their children, with each successive generation inheriting the resources of both of its parents. The combined resources of the parents allow them to give their child a better life growing up, and the combined inheritances from both parents place them at an even greater advantage than they would be with their superior education and childhoods. This has an enormous impact on the development of the social economic structure of a society.

== Economics ==
A related concept of &#x27;assortative &quot;matching&quot;&#x27; has been developed within economics. This relates to efficiencies in production available if workers are evenly matched in their skills or productivity. A consideration of this assortative matching forms the basis of Kremer&#x27;s 1993 O-ring theory of economic development.

<text>APE tags comprise one extant convention used to store information (metadata) about a given digital audio file. Each APE tag constitutes a discrete element that describes a single attribute of the file&#x27;s contents.
Each consists of a key/value pair; the key is simply a label that names the attribute, such as , , , or , etc.), and associated with it is a corresponding value, namely, some information descriptive of this file, in terms of the attribute in question (e.g., for ). APE tags can be used with .ape-formatted recordings, as well as with sound files of other audio file formats.

== Essence ==
A sound file, such as an .ape- or .mp3-formatted file, may, in addition to its payload audio data, also contain metadata that provide descriptive or statistical information about its audio content. When APE (v1) tags are used, they will appear at the end of the file, following the data; i.e., the digitized audio stream. Placing the tags at the end of the file, rather than at the beginning, can make expansion of the metadata simpler for programmers to code, but may add more wait time to the user experience for file loading and processing. APE field names (&quot;keys&quot;) are character strings for which no rigid standard exists, nor is there a set list of keys nor of their allowable values.

== Features ==
APE tags are more similar to Vorbis comments than ID3 tags. Like Vorbis comments, they are unstructured (key, value) pairs. However, unlike Vorbis comments, they do not allow for inter-key ordering. This is because they store a list of values for each key rather than one value per key.

APE values can be flagged as &quot;text&quot;, &quot;binary&quot;, or &quot;external&quot; types. This allows tag editing software to avoid incorrectly displaying binary values, such as an image of album cover art, in the form of unreadable text to users. In comparison, Vorbis comments do not have a flagging feature, so binary data cannot be easily stored in them (though this is by design).

APEv2 supports Unicode using UTF-8 for values. For keys, an ASCII subset (control characters from 0x00 to 0x1f are not allowed) must be used.

==Versions==
=== APEv1 ===
The &quot;APEv1 tag&quot; was designed for the Monkey&#x27;s Audio format. In MP3 files, the APE tag is stored at the very end of the file, with no inline declaration in the body of the file. The software handles the writing and access to the tag and does not interfere with the contents of the MP3.

=== APEv2 ===
The Musepack format developer, Frank Klemm, extended the original APE tag format to add a header, allowing APE tags to be at the beginning of files and allowing metadata values to be Unicode rather than simply ASCII. Because of its simplicity and flexibility, APEv2 was adopted by the WavPack and OptimFROG formats as their primary tag format. Version 3.99 of the official Monkey&#x27;s Audio software switched from using APEv1 to APEv2.

Media players such as Winamp, foobar2000, MusicBee support reading and writing of APEv2 tags in MP3 files. The tagging string &quot;APETAGEX&quot; signals the start of an APEv2 record, and the string &quot;TAG&quot; signals the start of an ID3v1 tag.

<text>The Royal Ordnance L7, officially designated Gun, 105 mm, Tank, L7, is the basic model of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most successful tank gun. It is a 105 mm L/52 rifled design by the Royal Ordnance Factories, intended for use in armoured fighting vehicles, replacing the older QF 20-pounder (84 mm) gun mounted on the British Centurion tank. The successful L7 gun has been fitted on many armoured vehicles, including the Centurion (starting from the Mk. 5/2 variant), the German Leopard 1 and, in an altered design, as the M68 gun in several variants of the US M48 Patton and M60.

The L7 is a popular weapon and continued in use even after it was superseded by the L11 series 120 mm rifled tank gun, for some Centurion tanks operating as Artillery Forward Observation and Armoured Vehicle, Royal Engineers (AVRE) vehicles. The L7, and adaptations of it, can be found as standard or retrofitted equipment on a wide variety of tanks developed during the Cold War.

==History==

Both the United Kingdom and the United States had been developing projects for high calibre guns during WWII in order to compete with increasingly heavily armoured German tanks, and later for Cold War Soviet tanks. The US developed several heavy tank designs during this period, notable were the US 105 mm gun motor carriage T95 (also known as &quot;super-heavy tank T28&quot;) as well as the QF 32-pounder mounted on the British A39 Tortoise heavy assault tank.

The US foresaw difficulties in engagements against the Soviet IS-3 and 4 with its M47 Patton. This led to the introduction of the M103, a heavy tank designed to counter Soviet heavy tanks. It mounted an extremely powerful 120 mm cannon but the ammunition was so large that it required two loaders, one for the shell and another for the separate propellant charge. Of the 300 M103s built, most went to the Marines. The UK came to the same conclusions and developed their own heavy tank, the Conqueror, which mounted the L1 120 mm gun.

===United Kingdom===
During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet T-54A medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the British embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians in November. After a brief examination of this tank&#x27;s armour and 100 mm gun, British officials decided that the 20-pounder was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armour. This meant the most common British tanks were no longer able to effectively deal with Soviet medium tank designs, let alone their heavy tanks.

These events spurred the United Kingdom to employ a new high-velocity tank gun in 1958, the Royal Ordnance L7 to keep existing Centurion tanks viable against this new Soviet tank design. While the United States began design development of the XM60 tank in 1957 and began user trials of the weapon in 1958. The L7 was specifically designed to fit into the turret mountings of the 20 pounder. This would enable the Centurion tanks to be up-gunned with minimum modifications; hence, the fleet could be upgraded in a shorter time and at a lower cost. The first production tank to integrate the L7 was a single up-armoured Centurion Mark 7 in 1958 which was to prove the future viability of up-armouring and up-gunning the Centurion. From 1959 onwards newly built Centurions incorporated the L7 at production.

===Other users===
The gun was subsequently adopted for use on the German Leopard 1 (for which the L7A3 variant was developed). In addition, several countries have used the gun to improve the firepower of existing main battle tanks. Derivatives have even been mounted in Warsaw Pact-built T-54 and T-55 tanks in Israel, India, Egypt and Iraq, and Type 79 tanks in China.

<doc id="1112129" wikidata="Q1052653" url="?curid=1112129" title="Near Oceania">
<text>Near Oceania is the part of Oceania that features greater biodiversity, due to the islands and atolls being closer to each other. The distinction of Near Oceania and Remote Oceania was first suggested by Pawley &amp; Green (1973) and was further elaborated on in Green (1991). The distinction is based on geology, flora and fauna. Near Oceania was also settled by humans at an earlier time than Remote Oceania was. Near Oceania includes the Bismarck Archipelago, the island of New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands (excluding Temotu Province). Sometimes, Australia is also included in Near Oceania.

==Prehistory==
The great nineteenth-century naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace explored Nusantara, drawing attention to fundamental biological differences between the Australia-New Guinea region and Southeast Asia. The boundary between the Asian and Australian faunal regions consists of a zone of smaller islands bearing the name of Wallacea, in honor of the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection.

Wallace speculated that the key to understanding these differences would lie in &quot;now-submerged lands, uniting islands to continents&quot; (1895). We now know that at several intervals during the Pleistocene, the sea surface was 130 metres below the current sea level. At these times, the Aru Islands, New Guinea, Tasmania, and some smaller islands were joined to the Australian mainland. Biogeographers call this enlarged Greater Australian continent &quot;Sahul&quot; (Ballard, 1993) or &quot;Meganesia&quot;. West of Wallacea, the vast Sunda Shelf was also exposed as dry land, greatly extending the Southeast Asian mainland to include the Greater Sunda Islands of Sundaland. However, the islands of Wallacea (primarily Sulawesi, Ambon, Ceram, Halmahera, and the Lesser Sunda Islands) always remained an island world, imposing a barrier to the dispersal of terrestrial vertebrates, including early hominids.

To the north and east of New Guinea, the islands of Near Oceania (the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons) were likewise never connected to Sahul by dry land, for deep-water trenches also separate these from the Australian continental shelf.

It seems that human colonization of this region was most likely effected during the interval between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago, although some researchers would push the possible dates earlier. But the key point is that even when the oceans were at their lowest levels, there were always significant open-water gaps between the islands of Wallacea, and therefore, the arrival of humans into Sahul, necessitated over-water transport.
This was also the case of the expansion of humans beyond New Guinea into the archipelagoes of Near Oceania. Herein lies one of the most exciting and intriguing aspects of Pacific prehistory: that we are likely dealing with the earliest purposive voyaging in human history.

:&quot;The settlement of Manus — in the Admiralty Islands — may represent a real threshold in voyaging ability as it is the only island settled in the Pleistocene beyond the range of one-way intervisibilty. Voyaging to Manus involved a blind crossing of some 60–90 km in a 200–300 km voyage, when no land would have been visible whether coming from the north coast of Sahul or New Hanover at the northern end of New Ireland. These would have been tense hours or days on board that first voyage and the name of &quot;Pleistocene Columbus&quot; who led this crew will never been known. The target arcs for Manus are 15° from New Hanover, 17° from Mussau and 28° from New Guinea.&quot; (Matthew Spriggs, &quot;The Island Melanesians&quot;, Oxford: Blackwell, 1997)

==History of the term==
The terms Near Oceania and Remote Oceania were proposed by anthropologists Roger Curtis Green and Andrew Pawley in 1973. By their definition, Near Oceania consists of the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, with the exception of the Santa Cruz Islands. They are designed to dispel the outdated categories of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia; Near Oceania cuts right across the old category of Melanesia, which has shown to be not a useful category in respect to the geography, culture, language and human history of the region. The old categories have been in use since they were proposed by French explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville in the mid-19th century. Though the push of some people in academia has been to replace the categories with Green&#x27;s terms since the early 1990s, the old categories are still used in science, popular culture and general usage.

<doc id="1112131" wikidata="Q920107" url="?curid=1112131" title="Battle of Wavre">
<text>The Battle of Wavre was the final major military action of the Hundred Days campaign and the Napoleonic Wars. It was fought on 18–19 June 1815 between the Prussian rearguard, consisting of the Prussian III Corps under the command of General Johann von Thielmann (whose chief-of-staff was Carl von Clausewitz) and three corps of the French army under the command of Marshal Grouchy. A blocking action, this battle kept 33,000 French soldiers from reaching the Battle of Waterloo and so helped in the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.

==Background==
Following defeat at the Battle of Ligny two days earlier, the Prussian army retreated north in good order and formed up at Wavre. Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-allied army won a tactical victory at Quatre Bras, but had been unable to come to the aid of the Prussians at Ligny and retreated northwards, to a defensive position at Waterloo. Napoleon moved the bulk of his army off in pursuit of Wellington, and sent Grouchy in pursuit of the retreating Prussians with the right wing (&quot;aile droite&quot;) of the Army of the North (&quot;L&#x27;Armée du Nord&quot;), a force consisting of 33,000 men and 80 guns.

The French units in the order of battle were:
* III Corps (General Dominique Vandamme)
** 17,099 infantry – 38 guns
* IV Corps (General Étienne Maurice Gérard)
** 15,013 infantry – 38 guns
* II Cavalry Corps (General Remy Exelmans)
** 3,392 infantry – 12 guns
* IV (Hussars) Cavalry Division (General Pierre Soult)
** 1,485 infantry – 8 guns detached from the I Cavalry Corps
** 5,000 cavalry from the Reserve Army

Grouchy was slow in taking up the pursuit after Ligny, which allowed Prince Blücher to fall back largely unmolested to Wavre, regroup his army, and then execute a flank march with three of his four corps to join up with Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-allied army at Waterloo. The remaining corps, the III Prussian Corps (Thielmann&#x27;s) of 17,000 men and 48 guns, was to follow the other three corps leaving a small rearguard in Wavre, unless the French appeared in force in which case he was to oppose any French attempt to close on the main body of the Prussian army.

==Prelude==
===French positions===
Marshal Grouchy was in Gembloux with III Corps commanded by General Vandamme and IV Corps commanded by General Gerard. The 4th Cavalry Division, commanded by Pajol, and the 21st infantry division, under Teste (from Lobau&#x27;s corps), formed the remainder of his force. Reconnaissance by Pajol&#x27;s horsemen during the 17th of June found that the Prussians had left Namur.

===French movements===

At around 06:00 of 18 June 1815 Grouchy reported to Napoleon that the Prussians had left Tourinnes by marching all night. He further reported that he was moving on Wavre with all haste. At 10:00 Grouchy reported to Napoleon that the Prussian I, II, and—mistakenly—III Corps were marching in the direction of Brussels, and that Prussian officers were talking of joining Wellington to offer battle to the French army. His despatch included a Prussian requisition form by way of proof. He suggested that by attacking and standing at Wavre, he could block the Prussians from intervening against the rest of the French army. At 11:30, Grouchy and his corps commanders heard in the distance the noise from the Grand Battery as the Battle of Waterloo started. Grouchy&#x27;s corps commanders, especially Gérard, suggested that they should &quot;march to the sound of the guns.&quot; Grouchy, however, had written and verbal orders from Napoleon to march on Wavre and to engage the Prussians there, and knew that Marshal Ney had been taken to task by Napoleon two days earlier for not following orders at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Grouchy therefore declined to follow his subordinates&#x27; suggestion, pointing out that Napoleon had more than enough force to deal with Wellington. Minutes after this conversation, Exelmans reported strong Prussian positions at Wavre. At 13:00, elements of Exelmans&#x27; cavalry were in contact with the Prussian 14th Brigade’s rear guard. Further argument was ended by the arrival at 16:00 of another order from Napoleon, repeating the instruction to Grouchy to attack the Prussians before him.

===Prussian movements===
Blücher had ordered Thielmann to defend the position of Wavre in the event of Marshal Grouchy advancing in force, or, if otherwise, to follow the main Prussian army in the direction of Couture-Saint-Germain and the battlefield of Waterloo. Thielmann was on the point of leaving Wavre to march towards Couture-Saint-Germain when the French III Corps (Vandamme&#x27;s) arrived in front of his position, at about 16:00, and the French artillery immediately opened a cannonade upon the Prussians.

All the brigades (the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) of the Prussian III Corps (Thielmann&#x27;s), had, at that time, received the order to commence the general movement to the right (west). A detachment of only two battalions (the Fusilier Battalions of the 30th Regiment and of the 1st Kurmark Landwehr), under Colonel Zepelin, from the 9th Brigade, which had not yet crossed the river Dyle, was to be left in occupation of Wavre. The 12th Brigade was already in full line of march, and the 11th had just been put in motion.

When General Borcke, who commanded the 9th Brigade, fell back upon Wavre for the purpose of carrying out his instructions, he found the bridge already barricaded, and therefore proceeded with his brigade to Basse-Wavre (a short distance east and down-stream of Wavre). Having crossed the Dyle at this point, he left a detachment there, consisting of the sharpshooters of the Fusilier Battalion of the 8th Regiment and those of the 1st Battalion of the 30th Regiment, under Major Ditfurth, whom he directed to destroy the bridge immediately. He then detached the 2nd Battalion of the 30th Regiment and his two squadrons of the Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, as a reinforcement to Zepelin at Wavre. With the remainder of his brigade, he then continued his march.

In the meantime, French &quot;Tirailleurs&quot; were observed extending along the opposite heights, and in their rear considerable masses of French troops appeared to be advancing. It soon became manifest to the Prussians that the French contemplated forcing a passage of the river.

===Prussian preparations and dispositions===
Thielmann, judging by the want of vigour displayed in the French pursuit and by the French not having attempted to secure the passage of the Dyle at Mousty, , and Limal, considered that it was only a weak detachment that was advancing upon Wavre, confining itself to the design of creating some little uneasiness by its movement along this road to Brussels. He had hitherto been of the opinion that the occupation of Wavre by a few battalions, as directed by Blücher, would be quite sufficient, but he now plainly saw that a moment had arrived which required him, in pursuance of his instructions, to maintain the position at Wavre. Accordingly, he ordered the halt of his whole corps for this purpose.

The town of Wavre is situated on the left (north) bank of the Dyle, having a suburb on the opposite side of the river, with which it was then connected by two stone bridges. The principal of these bridges led towards the middle, and the smaller one towards the upper end of the town. Higher up the stream, at the Mill of Bierges, at Limal, and at Limelette. Below the town at Basse-Wavre, there were wooden bridges. The river Dyle is not deep, but because of the very heavy rain over the previous 24 hours it was swollen.

The low range of heights on either side of the valley was covered in many places with woods. The heights on the right bank are generally more elevated, but those on the left have steeper declivities, and offer a greater command of the river and its passages. The shortest road from Namur to Brussels passed through the town, besides which there were numerous crossroads practicable for the movement of all arms. The great number of hollow ways forms a prominent feature in the vicinity, and these, being in a miry state from the rain, were unfavourable to the progress of troops passing through them.

The position was thus occupied:
* the 12th Brigade (Colonel Stülpnagel), with the Horse Battery No. 20, was posted on the height in rear of Bierge. The bridge in front of this village was barricaded, and the Mill occupied for the defence of the bridge.
* The 10th Brigade (Colonel Kämpfen) stood upon the heights in the rear of Wavre, its right resting on a wood which lay between it and the 12th Brigade.
* The 11th Brigade (Colonel Luce) was formed across the Brussels road.
* The reserve cavalry was drawn up, near , in columns of squadrons.
* The artillery was distributed along the heights. Horse Battery No. 18 remained in reserve.

That suburb of the town of Wavre which lies on the right (i.e., the south) bank was occupied by light troops only. The great bridge was barricaded as well as time and circumstances would admit. The houses adjoining the left bank of the river were hastily loopholed. The smaller bridge was left perfectly open. A detachment of two companies of light infantry, under Major Bornstadt was detached to reinforce the troops at the bridge at Basse-Wavre.

Thielmann intended that the 9th Brigade should be posted in rear of this general disposition of his troops, so that its services might be made available according as circumstances might require; but through some misunderstanding in the transmission of the order, General Borcke was induced, after having moved along the Brussels road until near La Bawette, thence to turn off to his left, and continue his march, according to his original instructions in the direction of Froidmont, Bourgeois, and Saint-Lambert, towards Couture-Saint-Germain; being under the impression that the whole corps had already commenced this march, in pursuance of the general plan, and that his brigade was destined to cover the movement.

The departure of the Brigade was not immediately discovered. Through this misunderstanding, Thielmann&#x27;s force suffered an unexpected reduction of six battalions and Foot Battery No. 18; and consisted, therefore, of only 15,200 men, with which number he had now to contend against Marshal Grouchy&#x27;s force, amounting altogether to 33,765 men.

In the opinion of William Siborne a contemporary British historian, Thielmann&#x27;s position was certainly a very favourable one, and the occupation of it was arranged with great skill. It was impossible to foresee in what manner the attack upon it would be conducted—whether it would be directed against one particular bridge, or against all the bridges, with the design of carrying the whole Line by storm. Thielmann therefore limited the occupation of the town and of the line of the river to the number of light troops that might be sufficient for sustaining any sudden assault, taking care to have support close at hand for that purpose. However, he placed his reserves, which comprised his main force, so that they might become available at any point which might be pressed. Should the French develop greatly superior numbers, as was subsequently the case, that would serve to guard against any flank attack.

==Battle==


Late in the afternoon of 18 June, as Napoleon was heavily engaged against Wellington at Waterloo, Grouchy, commanding the corps of General Gérard and General Vandamme, prepared to attack the Prussian forces confronting him over the River Dyle between the towns of Wavre and Limal.

General Vandamme opened the Battle of Wavre at 16:00, unlimbering 3 batteries, then moved Habert&#x27;s division in an attempt to take the bridges by quick assault. Marshal Grouchy, having just received Marshal Soult&#x27;s order to move against Wavre, ordered Exelmans&#x27; cavalry with an infantry battalion against the bridge at Bas-Wavre while Lefol&#x27;s division moved against the bridge at Bierges. The fusilier battalion of the 1st Kurmark Landwehr Regiment defended the Bierge bridge by removing timbers from it under French fire and counter-charging any attempt to repair it. The Kurmarkers held the right bank of the stone bridge at Wavre for some time, forcing Vandamme&#x27;s troops to waste precious time taking it. Once this was done the French rushed across the bridge and straight into a vicious street fight. A battalion of the 2nd Kurmark Landwehr Regiment moved to support the 1st and threw the French back across the bridge. A renewed French assault penetrated further down the same street, only to be ambushed from side streets by the fusiliers of the 1st Kurmark Landwehr and 30th Line Infantry Regiments using point blank musketry. A bayonet charge sent the French scrambling across the bridge again. This see-saw battle would continue throughout the night. Later attacks by the French upon Wavre met with no more success. The Prussians assigned another battalion and three guns to the bridge. The bridge at Bas-Wavre had been destroyed by the Prussians. The attacks by Lefol upon the bridge of Bierges had no more success, being hampered by muddy ground and the tough defense of the Prussian 31st Line Infantry Regiment supported by the 2nd battalion of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr Regiment and a horse battery. Three small battalions and three squadrons of cavalry under Stengel were to guard a bridge to the west at Limal.

Marshal Soult&#x27;s 13:00 letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and to attack Bülow arrived after 18:00. Grouchy at once began gathering additional divisions and headed to Limal, arriving at 23:00, where he found that Pajol&#x27;s cavalry had forced the bridge there. Prussian scouting cavalry noticed the strong French columns moving to Limal and the Prussian 12th Brigade moved covering forces to the area. The Prussians made a bayonet charge in an attempt to retake Limal, but without success. Night closed the major actions of the battle of Wavre, although outposts fired on each other all night.

At approximately 20:00 the French attack at Waterloo was irrevocably lost as its left, center, and right collapsed within a few minutes of each other. Grouchy was by then across the Dyle, but meanwhile the remnants of the &quot;Armėe du Nord&quot; were streaming south towards the imagined safety of French territory.

Fighting renewed in the early hours. The forest south of Limal was forced by 09:00. Thielmann then elected to retreat as the campaign had been decided by the fighting elsewhere. The definitive report of the victory at Waterloo reached Thielmann at 10:00 as his retreat started.

Grouchy, watching the Prussian retreat, was beginning his planned move upon Brussels when the news reached him at 10:30 that Napoleon had been defeated. Though in shock, Grouchy realised he was in danger of being trapped and his entire command destroyed. He at once had Exelmans move his cavalry to secure the bridges and began a retreat by forced marches that would take him back to Paris. The victorious French forces had held the battlefield for only 30 minutes.

==Conclusion==
While the battle ended in a French tactical victory, with the Prussians in retreat and Grouchy firmly athwart Prussian lines of communication to the east, this victory proved hollow as Napoléon was defeated at Waterloo. The Prussians had held their ground long enough to allow Blücher&#x27;s transfer of 50,000 troops to Wellington’s aid at Waterloo. In addition, the Prussian rearguard of 17,000 troops had tied down 33,000 French troops that could have otherwise taken part at Waterloo. Thus, for the Prussians, the battle was a strategic success, as it contributed to the decisive victory at Waterloo.

<text>Mixed inhibition is a type of enzyme inhibition in which the inhibitor may bind to the enzyme whether or not the enzyme has already bound the substrate but has a greater affinity for one state or the other. It is called &quot;mixed&quot; because it can be seen as a conceptual &quot;mixture&quot; of competitive inhibition, in which the inhibitor can only bind the enzyme if the substrate &quot;has not&quot; already bound, and uncompetitive inhibition, in which the inhibitor can only bind the enzyme if the substrate &quot;has&quot; already bound. If the ability of the inhibitor to bind the enzyme is &quot;exactly the same&quot; whether or not the enzyme has already bound the substrate, it is known as a non-competitive inhibitor. Non-competitive inhibition is sometimes thought of as a special case of mixed inhibition. 

In mixed inhibition, the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site, i.e. a site different from the active site where the substrate binds. However, not all inhibitors that bind at allosteric sites are mixed inhibitors. 

Mixed inhibition may result in either:
* A decrease in the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (Km value appears to increase; formula_1) -- seen in cases where the inhibitor favours binding to the free enzyme. More closely mimics competitive binding.
* An increase in the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (Km value appears to decrease; formula_2) -- seen in cases where the inhibitor favours binding to the enzyme-substrate complex. More closely mimics uncompetitive binding.
In either case the inhibition decreases the apparent maximum enzyme reaction rate (formula_3).

Mathematically, mixed inhibition occurs when the factors α and α’ (introduced into the Michaelis-Menten equation to account for competitive and uncompetitive inhibition, respectively) are both greater than 1.

In the special case where α = α’, noncompetitive inhibition occurs, in which case formula_4 is reduced but formula_5 is unaffected. This is very unusual in practice.

== Biological examples ==
In gluconeogenesis, the enzyme cPEPCK (cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) is responsible for converting oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvic acid, or PEP, when guanosine triphosphate, GTP, is present. This step is exclusive for gluconeogenesis, which occurs under fasting condition&#x27;s due to the body&#x27;s depletion of glucose. cPEPCK is known to be regulated by Genistein, an isoflavone that is naturally found in a number of plants. It was first proven that genistein inhibits the activity of cPEPCK. In a study, the presence of this isoflavone resulted in a decrease in the level of blood sugar. A lowered blood sugar level means less glucose is in the blood. If this occurs in a subject that is fasting, this is because the gluconeogenesis was inhibited, preventing increased production of glucose. The ability of genistein to lower a person&#x27;s blood sugar level allows it to be referred to as an anti-diabetic property. The mechanism in which genistein inhibited the enzyme cPEPCK was further evaluated. First, cPEPCK was placed in the presence of 3-Mercaptopropionic acid, or 3-MPA, a known inhibitor of the enzyme. It was compared to the results of placing cPEPCK in the presence of genistein, which revealed that the mechanism of mixed inhibition was used to decrease cPEPCK&#x27;s activity. cPEPCK undergoes multiple configurations when catalyzing the formation of PEP. It can be either unbound, bound to GDP or bound to GTP. An experiment that studied the affinity for genistein in these different configurations was conducted. It revealed that geinstein favors binding to the cPEPCK with a bound GTP than then the enzyme with a bound GDP, which was found to be less stable. This was because the GTP-bound cPEPCK revealed an extended binding site for genistein. This is the same binding site as the enzyme&#x27;s intended substrate, oxaloacetate while the other configurations did not do so in the presence of genistein. This provided evidence that the mechanism of inhibition of cPEPCK by genistein was a mixture of competitive and non-competitive inhibition.

A kallikrein is a type of serine protease, which cleaves peptide bonds after certain amino acids in a protein. These 15 kallikreins, KLK1 to KLK15, are found in human tissues. The ability for this molecule to cleave proteins results in the effective activation of cell surface receptors, making them crucial elements of many biological signal transduction pathways, and its amplification through cascades. This family of serine proteases is often a biomarker to diseases, and therefore, have become a target for inhibition. Inhibition of these kallikreins results in possible therapy for diseases such as metastatic cancer or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Fukugetin, or (+)-morelloflavone, is a type of plant biflavonoid isolated from &quot;Garcinia brasiliensis&quot;. After isolating fukugetin, it was placed with KLK1, KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, KLK5, KLK6, and KLK7 in varying concentrations. This allowed for the analysis of enzyme kinetics through derivation of parameters Km and Vmax. Through the model of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the Eadie-Hofstee diagram was plotted. It confirmed that fukugetin acts as a mixed inhibitor by exhibiting varying but present affinities for the enzyme alone and the enzyme-substrate complex. Analyzing through kinetics, fukugetin decreased the Vmax while it increased the Km for these KLKs. Typically, in competitive inhibition, Vmax remains the same while Km increases, and in non-competitive inhibition, Vmax decreases while Km remains the same. The change in both of these variables is another finding consistent with the effects of a mixed inhibitor.

<text>USS &quot;Dragonet&quot; (SS-293), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the dragonet.

==History==
&quot;Dragonet&quot; (SS-293) was launched 18 April 1943 by Cramp Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia; sponsored by Mrs. J. E. Gingrich; and commissioned 6 March 1944.

&quot;Dragonet&quot; was depth charged during a series of controlled tests in April, May and June 1944 off Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

&quot;Dragonet&quot; reached Pearl Harbor from New London 9 October 1944, and put out on her first war patrol 1 November, bound for the Kurile Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk. On the morning of 15 December 1944, while submerged south of Matsuwa, &quot;Dragonet&quot; struck an uncharted submerged pinnacle, which holed her pressure hull in the forward torpedo room. The space was completely flooded, and in order to surface the submarine, it was necessary to blow water out of the compartment with compressed air. At 0845 she surfaced, just from the airfield on Matsuwa, and set course to clear the danger area as quickly as possible. Her bow planes were rigged out, and in order to rerig them, it would be necessary to enter the flooded compartment. Next day this was accomplished by putting pressure in the forward battery compartment, and opening the water-tight door into the forward torpedo room. The determination and skill of her crew were further tried when she had to run through two days of storm to reach Midway 20 December for emergency repairs.

After overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, CA., &quot;Dragonet&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 2 April 1945, and sailed on her next patrol 19 April. She called at Guam to refuel from 1 to 3 May, then proceeded to lifeguard duty south of the Japanese home islands. She rescued four downed Army aviators during this patrol, and returned to refit at Guam between 10 June and 8 July.

&quot;Dragonet&quot;&#x27;s third war patrol, between 8 July 1945 and 17 August, was a combination of lifeguard duty and offensive against Japanese shipping in Bungo Suido. At this late stage in the war, the remnants of the Japanese merchant marine provided few targets, and none was contacted by &quot;Dragonet&quot;. She rescued a downed naval aviator near Okino Shima. Putting into Saipan at the close of the war, she sailed on to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco.

===Post World War II===
&quot;Dragonet&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island 16 April 1946, and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Early in 1961, she was towed from Pearl Harbor to Norfolk, Virginia by the fleet tug USS Takelma (ATF-113) prior to her disposal. She was struck from the Naval Register 1 June 1961, and sunk by explosive test in Chesapeake Bay.


==Awards==
&quot;Dragonet&quot;&#x27;s second and third war patrols were designated as &quot;successful&quot;. She received two battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Batemans Brewery (George Bateman &amp; Son Ltd) is an English brewery based at Salem Bridge Brewery in Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, and founded in 1874. The company owns 69 public houses, with 23 situated in Boston alone. The brewery focuses on cask conditioned ales, their best known being &quot;XB&quot; and &quot;XXXB&quot;. Their slogan is &quot;Good Honest Ales&quot;.

==Early history==
Batemans was founded in 1874 by George Bateman, a local farmer who sold his farm in nearby Friskney in order to rent a brewery in Wainfleet, situated by the railway. He bought the brewery equipment for £505 10s (roughly equivalent to £30,000 today); a year later he bought the lease for £800. Before he retired, Edwin Crowe, from whom Bateman had bought his equipment, passed on his knowledge of the craft to George and his wife Suzanna (who had had a little experience of home brewing). Crowe&#x27;s expert brewer stayed on with Bateman for some years, despite his blindness.

In 1880 Bateman had earned enough from the business to buy Salem House, a Georgian building some 200 yards from the original brewery, and a new brewery was built in its coach houses. In addition to the brewing, Bateman bottled spirits, and his wife baked bread for sale.

&quot;On Fair Day, which was held twice a year, the farmers would come to Salem House to pay for the beer their workers had consumed the previous six months. It was very common for this payment to not be paid in cash, but with meat and potatoes. Once payment had been made, we would invite the farmers into our kitchen for a massive feast. This tradition continued until 1930.&quot;

By 1910 the company was engaged in the bottling of Guinness and Bass for its estate.

Bateman&#x27;s son, Harry, went into the business, which he bought from his father in 1919. The 1920s and 1930s proved to be a very lean time for the industry, partly because of severe restrictions on brewing that had come in during World War I, partly because of higher taxes, and a consequent decrease in sales. At one point Bateman had to lay off his entire workforce, but their resulting plight made him take them back; in order to find work for them, he expanded the business into building opposite Salem House — including a derelict windmill which was to become the brewery&#x27;s trademark.

By 1948 the tied estate had grown to 68 pubs.

Mild ale was the principal product during the 1950s.

From 1970 until 1992 the brewery ran a line for the production of keg beers.

The company&#x27;s XXXB beer was introduced on 1 February 1978.

During the 1980s the company faced a difficult decision: half of the family wanted to sell up and half wanted to continue brewing. Chairman George Bateman, his wife Pat and their children Stuart and Jaclyn saved up enough money to buy out the family members who wanted to sell, and the company lived on.

==The pub business==
On his twenty-first birthday, Harry Bateman had been given a pub by his father; in the 1920s he began to expand upon that beginning, and bought a group of pubs generally thought to be worthless. This chain was expanded in 1927 by the purchase of the Vine Hotel in Skegness, and in 1935 by the building of the County Hotel in the same town. In 1957, when Batemans already owned a chain of seventy pubs, they bought another twenty-nine, mostly run-down pubs to the north of Boston, as well as some in the town itself. It took eight years to renovate and obtain licences for them (at the time, a pub could not have a licence unless it had at least two rooms).

Batemans beers are now available from pubs throughout the UK, but especially within Lincolnshire and neighbouring counties.

<text>The khopesh (&#x27;; also vocalizedkhepesh) is an Egyptian sickle-shaped sword that developed from battle axes.

==Description==
A typical &quot;khopesh&quot; is in length, though smaller examples also exist. The inside curve of the weapon could be used to trap an opponent&#x27;s arm, or to pull an opponent&#x27;s shield out of the way. These weapons changed from bronze to iron in the New Kingdom period. The earliest known depiction of a &quot;khopesh&quot; is from the Stele of the Vultures, depicting King Eannatum of Lagash wielding the weapon; this would date the &quot;khopesh&quot; to at least 2500 BC.

The blade is only sharpened on the outside portion of the curved end. The &quot;khopesh&quot; evolved from the epsilon or similar crescent-shaped axes that were used in warfare.

==History==
The &quot;khopesh&quot; fell out of use around 1300 BC. However, on the 196 BC Rosetta Stone, it is referenced as the &quot;sword&quot; determinative in a hieroglyph block, with the spelled letters of kh, p, and sh to say:

Various pharaohs are depicted with a &quot;khopesh&quot;, and some have been found in royal graves, such as the two examples found with Tutankhamun.

Although some examples have clearly sharpened edges, many examples have dull edges that apparently were never intended to be sharp. It may therefore be possible that some &quot;khopeshes&quot; found in high-status graves were ceremonial variants.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;khopesh&quot; may have been derived from &quot;leg&quot;, as in &quot;leg of beef&quot;, because of their similarity in shape. The hieroglyph for &quot;ḫpš&quot; (&#x27;leg&#x27;) is found as early as during the time of the Coffin Texts (the First Intermediate Period).

<text>Chicago V is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Chicago. It was released on July 10, 1972, by Columbia Records. It is the group&#x27;s first single album release, after having released three consecutive double albums and a four-disc box set of live material.

==History==
Following the release of &quot;Chicago III&quot; in 1971, the group changed from producing double albums, with many songs arranged in extended suites, in favor of more concise tracks on a single album. It is often considered the group&#x27;s return-to-basics as it has a sound resembling their first album, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority.&quot; &quot;Chicago V&quot; is also notable for Robert Lamm&#x27;s prolific songwriting; Eight out of its ten tunes are composed solely by him. Terry Kath wrote and sang the album&#x27;s final track &quot;Alma Mater&quot;, which showcased his acoustic guitar abilities. The song &quot;A Hit by Varèse&quot; is a tribute to French-American composer Edgard Varèse. This would be the last album not to have any compositions from Peter Cetera during his tenure in the band.

Recorded just before &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot; was released in late 1971, &quot;Chicago V&quot; was cut in just over a week and held over for release until the following summer. Released shortly before the album, the single &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot; was the band&#x27;s biggest hit to that point, reaching No. 3 in the US. &quot;Chicago V&quot; was critically acclaimed and became Chicago&#x27;s first No.1 album, spending nine weeks atop the charts in the US. In the UK, the release managed to reach No. 24. The follow-up single &quot;Dialogue (Part I &amp; II)&quot; also became a hit, peaking at No. 24 in the US.

This album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. In 2002, &quot;Chicago V&quot; was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records with three bonus tracks: a rehearsal of Lamm&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Richard and His Friends&quot;, which was debuted at Carnegie Hall, an early rehearsal of Kath&#x27;s &quot;Mississippi Delta City Blues&quot; (which would later be re-recorded and released on &quot;Chicago XI&quot;), and a single edit of &quot;Dialogue&quot;.

On August 17, 2011, Warner Japan released this album as a hybrid stereo-multichannel Super Audio CD in their Warner Premium Sound series.

<doc id="1112175" wikidata="Q3032210" url="?curid=1112175" title="Sulayman al-Arabi">
<text>Sulayman ibn Yaqzan al-Kalbi al-Arabi (al-A&#x27;rabi meaning the Bedouin; full name in ) was an Arab Muslim wāli (governor) of Barcelona and Girona in the year 777.

For the history of al-Arabi, we must rely on the Muslim historian Abu al-Hassan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad (1160-1233), also known as Ali ‘izz ad-Din ibn al-Athir al-Jazari (ibn al-Athir), who wrote four centuries after the fact.

When the Abbasid governor Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Siqlabi landed near Murcia sometime before 777, he sent an invitation to al-Arabi to join him, but the governor of Barcelona refused. Al-Siqlabi then marched on Barcelona, but was defeated near Valencia.

According to ibn al-Athir, threatened by Abd ar-Rahman I, the Umayyad emir of Córdoba, al-Arabi sent a delegation to Charlemagne at the diet in Paderborn, offering his submission, together with the allegiance of Husayn of Zaragoza and Abu Taur of Huesca in return for military aid. As a result, Charlemagne marched across the Pyrenees toward Zaragoza in 778, joined by troops led by Sulayman.

Husayn of Zaragoza, however, refused to surrender the city, claiming that he had never promised Charlemagne his allegiance. After a month of siege Charlemagne decided to return to his kingdom, taking some hostages from his Muslim allies including Sulayman.

On his retreat, Charlemagne suffered an attack from the Basques in central Navarra. As a reprisal he attacked Pamplona, conquering it. However, on his retreat north his baggage train was ambushed at the battle of Roncevaux Pass August 15, 778. The children of Sulayman, Aysun al-Arabi and Matruh al-Arabi collaborated with the Basques in the assault which resulted in the release of their father.

Sulayman returned to Zaragoza where, in 780, he was killed by his former friend and ally Husayn of Zaragoza.

These historical events are assumed to be part of the factual nucleus around which was eventually formed, by centuries of oral tradition on the Christian side, the Song of Roland, which was to have an immense importance in the medieval culture of France and the whole of Christian Western Europe. It did not, however, make a comparable deep and lasting impression on the Muslim side.

<text>Anthony William Currie (born 1 January 1950) is an English former footballer who had significant spells for Sheffield United, Leeds United and Queens Park Rangers as well as representing England.

He was an effervescent and exuberant attacking midfield player with the vision and ability to strike long dangerous passes. His nephew, Darren Currie, was also a midfielder.

==Career==
Currie was a talented schoolboy footballer who represented Hendon Boys before joining Queens Park Rangers as an amateur, whilst working for a building firm. He joined Chelsea as an apprentice, but was released and moved to Watford to complete his apprenticeship, earning England Youth honours in the process. He turned professional in May 1967 and made his league debut the following season.

He was transferred to Sheffield United on 1 February 1968 for £26,500. He scored on his debut against Tottenham Hotspur with a header on 26 February but missed the next game on 2 March as it was his wedding day. &#x27;TC&#x27; or &#x27;Top Cat&#x27; as he was nicknamed by Sheffield United fans, was idolised in his time at Bramall Lane. He went on to score 54 goals in 313 appearances and was also made captain by manager Ken Furphy in March 1974. In September 2014, as part of the club&#x27;s 125th Anniversary celebrations, he was named Sheffield United&#x27;s Greatest Ever Player

In June 1976 he moved to Yorkshire rivals Leeds United for £250,000, making his Leeds debut in a 2–2 draw with West Bromwich Albion. His skills made him a firm favourite at Leeds, where he played a total of 124 games, scoring 16 goals. His curling shot during United&#x27;s November 1978 4–0 home win against Southampton F.C. won ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Big Match&quot; Goal of the Season that year. Currie&#x27;s form helped Leeds reach the League Cup semi–finals in 1978 and 1979, and in the 1978–79 season Leeds finished fifth to qualify for the UEFA Cup. As his wife was homesick for London this resulted in his sale to Queens Park Rangers in August 1979.

Currie captained Rangers in the 1982 FA Cup final replay, though he conceded the penalty from which Glenn Hoddle scored the winning goal. His career was badly affected by injuries and, after five goals in 81 games, he dropped out of league football and into semi-retirement from the game. He moved to Canada and spent two months playing for the Toronto Nationals, joining Chesham United on his return to Britain. He subsequently joined Southend United on non-contract terms before being persuaded by David Webb to join Torquay United in February 1984. He scored once in 16 games for the Gulls.

He moved to Tranmere Rovers in October 1984, but left without appearing in their first team, leaving him with 81 goals in 528 league games. He moved into non–league football, playing for Dunstable Town, Hendon and Goole Town before being appointed Football in the Community co-ordinator at Sheffield United in February 1988, a post he still holds today.

===International career===
During his time at Sheffield United, he broke into the England team, winning the first of his 17 caps in 1972. He was capped 11 times whilst at Leeds.

He played in the World Cup qualifier against Poland, which was held at Wembley Stadium in 1973. England dominated the match, but could only draw 1–1 and failed to qualify.

<doc id="1112185" wikidata="Q4223496" url="?curid=1112185" title="Tick paralysis">
<text>Tick paralysis is a type of paralysis caused by specific types of attached ticks. Unlike tick-borne diseases caused by infectious organisms, the illness is caused by a neurotoxin produced in the tick&#x27;s salivary gland. After prolonged attachment, the engorged tick transmits the toxin to its host. The incidence of tick paralysis is unknown. Patients can experience severe respiratory distress (similar to anaphylaxis).

==Signs and symptoms==

Tick paralysis results from injection of a toxin from tick salivary glands during a blood meal. The toxin causes symptoms within 2–7 days, beginning with weakness in both legs that progresses to paralysis. The paralysis ascends to the trunk, arms, and head within hours and may lead to respiratory failure and death. The disease can present as acute ataxia without muscle weakness.

Patients may report minor sensory symptoms, such as local numbness, but constitutional signs are usually absent. Deep tendon reflexes are usually decreased or absent, and ophthalmoplegia and bulbar palsy can occur.

Electromyographic (EMG) studies usually show a variable reduction in the amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, but no abnormalities of repetitive nerve stimulation studies. These appear to result from a failure of acetylcholine release at the motor nerve terminal level. There may be subtle abnormalities of motor nerve conduction velocity and sensory action potentials.

==Pathogenesis==
Tick paralysis is believed to be due to toxins found in the tick&#x27;s saliva that enter the bloodstream while the tick is feeding. The two ticks most commonly associated with North American tick paralysis are the Rocky Mountain wood tick (&quot;Dermacentor andersoni&quot;) and the American dog tick (&quot;Dermacentor variabilis&quot;); however, 43 tick species have been implicated in human disease around the world. Most North American cases of tick paralysis occur from April to June, when adult &quot;Dermacentor&quot; ticks emerge from hibernation and actively seek hosts. In Australia, tick paralysis is caused by the tick &quot;Ixodes holocyclus&quot;. Prior to 1989, 20 fatal cases were reported in Australia.

Although tick paralysis is of concern in domestic animals and livestock in the United States as well, human cases are rare and usually occur in children under the age of 10.

Tick paralysis occurs when an engorged and gravid (egg-laden) female tick produces a neurotoxin in its salivary glands and transmits it to its host during feeding. Experiments have indicated that the greatest amount of toxin is produced between the fifth and seventh day of attachment (often initiating or increasing the severity of symptoms), although the timing may vary depending on the species of tick.

Unlike Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis, which are caused by the systemic proliferation and expansion of microbes after the offending tick is gone, tick paralysis is chemically induced by the tick and therefore usually only continues in its presence. Once the tick is removed, symptoms usually diminish rapidly. However, in some cases, profound paralysis can develop and even become fatal before anyone becomes aware of a tick&#x27;s presence.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on symptoms and upon finding an embedded tick, usually on the scalp.

In the absence of a tick, the differential diagnosis includes Guillain–Barré syndrome. Early signs of tick poisoning could be a change of an animals&#x27; ‘voice’, weakness in the back legs or vomiting.

==Prevention==

No human vaccine is currently available for any tick-borne disease, except for tick-borne encephalitis. Individuals should therefore take precautions when entering tick-infested areas, particularly in the spring and summer months. Preventive measures include avoiding trails that are overgrown with bushy vegetation, wearing light-coloured clothes that allow one to see the ticks more easily, and wearing long pants and closed-toe shoes. Tick repellents containing DEET (N,N, diethyl-m-toluamide) are only marginally effective and can be applied to skin or clothing. Rarely, severe reactions can occur in some people who use DEET-containing products. Young children may be especially vulnerable to these adverse effects. Permethrin, which can only be applied to clothing, is much more effective in preventing tick bites. Permethrin is not a repellent but rather an insecticide; it causes ticks to curl up and fall off the protected clothing.

==Treatment==

Removal of the offending tick usually results in resolution of symptoms within several hours to days. If the tick is not removed, the toxin can be fatal. A 1969 study of children reported mortality rates of 10 – 12 percent, mostly due to respiratory paralysis. The tick is best removed by grasping it as close to the skin as possible and pulling in a firm steady manner. Because the toxin lies in the tick&#x27;s salivary glands, care must be taken to remove the entire tick (including the head), or symptoms may persist, although this is not true at least of &quot;Ixodes holocyclus&quot; (Australian paralysis tick).

It is important to note that, unlike the toxin of other tick species, the toxin of &quot;Ixodes holocyclus&quot; (Australian paralysis tick) may still be fatal even if the tick is removed.

For affected animals, food and water intake can worsen the outcome, as the toxin can prevent the animal from swallowing properly. People who find a tick on their animal, are advised to remove it immediately and seek veterinary assistance if the animal shows any signs of illness. The tick can be placed in a tightly sealed plastic bag and taken to a veterinarian for identification.

==Research==

Although several attempts have been made to isolate and identify the neurotoxin since the first isolation in 1966, the exact structure of the toxin has still not been published. The 40-80 kDa protein fraction contains the toxin.

The neurotoxin structure and gene, at least for the tick species Ixodes holocyclus have since been identified and are called holocyclotoxins after the species. At least three members (HT-1, HT-3, and HT-12) trigger paralysis by presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release via a calcium dependent mechanism resulting in a reduction of quantal content, and loss of effective neuromuscular synaptic transmission.

==Culture==

In the TV show, &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot;, Season 1, Episode 2, a patient is diagnosed with tick paralysis who has been deer hunting.

In the TV show, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, Season 5, Episode 4, &quot;Equipment&quot; (first aired Oct. 4, 1975), Dr. Joe Early diagnoses a young boy who has fallen from a tree with tick paralysis, after eliminating polio as a cause.

In the TV show, &quot;House&quot;, Season 2, Episode 16, &quot;Safe&quot;, Dr House diagnoses a patient (played by Michelle Trachtenberg) with tick paralysis.

In the TV show, &quot;Remedy&quot;, Season 1 Episode 7, &quot;Tomorrow, the Green Grass&quot;, Rebecca is diagnosed with tick paralysis.

In the TV show, &quot;Royal Pains&quot;, Season 1 Episode 3, &quot;Strategic Planning&quot;, a US Senator&#x27;s teenage son is diagnosed with and overcomes tick paralysis.

In the TV show, &quot;Chicago Med&quot;, Season 3, Episode 5, &quot;Mountains and Molehills&quot;, a young girl returning from Australia with increasing paralysis is diagnosed with tick paralysis.

<text>Abu Tawr () was &quot;wali&quot; of Washka, a Muslim nobleman, perhaps member of the Banu Salama () clan. Alternatively, it has been suggested that he may be the individual Al-Andalus genealogist Ibn Hazm named as Abu Tawr ibn Qasi, son of the eponymous ancestor of the powerful Muwallad Banu Qasis.

At the imperial diet of Paderborn, he joined with Sulayman al-Arabi, the &quot;wali&quot; of Barcelona, and Husayn, wali of Zaragoza, in offering of their domains to Charlemagne in exchange for military aid in a new revolt against &quot;Emir&quot; Abd ar-Rahman I, with the aim of reinstating Abbasid power in Al-Andalus. Charlemagne marched an army and took possession of Barcelona and Washka in 778, but Huseyn reneged and following an unsuccessful assault on Zaragoza, the alliance ended in failure with the Frankish withdrawal and defeat at Roncesvaux.

In 790 he proposed an alliance with Louis the Pious.

<doc id="1112192" wikidata="Q2985133" url="?curid=1112192" title="White Panther Party">
<text>The White Panthers were an anti-racist political collective founded in November 1968 by Pun Plamondon, Leni Sinclair, and John Sinclair. It was started in response to an interview where Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panther Party, was asked what white people could do to support the Black Panthers. Newton replied that they could form a White Panther Party. The counterculture era group took the name and dedicated its energies to &quot;cultural revolution.” John Sinclair made every effort to ensure that the White Panthers were not mistaken for a white supremacist group, responding to such claims with &quot;quite the contrary.&quot; The party worked with many ethnic minority rights groups in the Rainbow Coalition.

==Michigan years==
The group was most active in Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan, and included the proto-punk band MC5, which John Sinclair managed for several years before he was incarcerated. From a general ideological perspective, Plamondon and Sinclair defined the White Panthers as &quot;fighting for a clean planet and the freeing of political prisoners.&quot; The White Panthers added other elements such as advocating &quot;rock &#x27;n roll, dope, sex in the streets and the abolishing of capitalism.&quot; Yippie co-founder Abbie Hoffman praised the WPP in &quot;Steal This Book&quot; and &quot;Woodstock Nation&quot;, and John Sinclair often referred to himself as a Yippie as well.

The group emerged from the Detroit Artists Workshop, a radical arts collective founded in 1964 near Wayne State University. Among its concerns was the legalization of marijuana; John Sinclair had several arrests for possession. It aligned itself with radical politics, claiming the 12th Street Riot was justifiable under political and economic conditions in Detroit.

Plamondon was indicted with John Sinclair in connection to the bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in Ann Arbor on September 29, 1968, a year after the founding of the group. Upon hearing on the left-wing alternative radio station WABX that he had been indicted, he fled the U.S. for Europe and Africa, spending time in Algeria with exiled Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver. After secretly re-entering the country, and on his way to a safe house in northern Michigan, he was arrested in a routine traffic stop, joining John Sinclair, who had been sentenced to nine and a half years in jail for violating Michigan&#x27;s marijuana possession laws, in prison. Plamondon was convicted and was in prison when Sinclair was released on bond in 1971 while appeals were being heard on his case. Sinclair&#x27;s unexpected release came two days after a large &quot;Free John&quot; benefit concert, with performances from John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Bob Seger, and Stevie Wonder, was held at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Crisler Arena.

==Legal reforms==
The group had a direct role in two important legal decisions. A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1972 quashed Plamondon&#x27;s conviction and destroyed the case against John Sinclair. The court ruled warrantless wiretapping was unlawful under the U.S. Constitution, even in the case where national security, as defined by the executive branch, was in danger. The White Panthers had been charged with conspiring to destroy government property and evidence used to convict Plamondon was acquired through wiretaps not submitted to judicial approval. The case &quot;U.S. vs. U.S. District Court (Plamondon et al.)&quot;, 407 U.S. 297, commonly known as the Keith Case, held that the Fourth Amendment shielded private speech from surveillance unless a warrant had been granted, and that the &quot;warrant procedure would not frustrate the legitimate purposes of domestic security searches.&quot; The judgment freed Plamondon, yet John Sinclair was free only on bond fighting his possession conviction. In 1972, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in the &quot;People v. Sinclair&quot;, 387 Mich. 91, 194 N.W.2d 878 (1972) that Michigan&#x27;s classification of marijuana was unconstitutional, in effect decriminalizing possession until a new law conforming to the ruling was passed by the Michigan Legislature a week later. Sinclair was freed but the cumulative effects of the imprisonment had marked the end of the White Panther Party in Michigan, which renamed itself the Rainbow People&#x27;s Party while John Sinclair and Plamondon were in prison. The Rainbow People&#x27;s Party, headquartered in Ann Arbor, disbanded in 1973.

==Portland==
The headquarters of the White Panthers in Portland, Oregon were raided by the FBI on December 5, 1970. Two members of the group were arrested and accused of throwing a molotov cocktail through the window of a local Selective Service office.

==San Francisco==
White Panther Party chapters in San Francisco, Marin and Berkeley remained active into the 1980s. The WPP ran a successful &#x27;Food Conspiracy&#x27; that provided groceries to about 5,000 Bay Area residents at low cost, due to bulk buying and minimum markup. The White Panthers held &quot;People&#x27;s Ballroom in the Park&quot; concerts in Golden Gate Park. In 1983, angry because then-Mayor of San Francisco Dianne Feinstein proposed to ban handguns in the city, the San Francisco White Panthers mounted a successful petition drive that forced Feinstein into a recall election, which she won with about 82% of the vote.

==United Kingdom==
Author and anarchist Mick Farren, a leader of the United Kingdom Underground, later founded the White Panthers UK, which was one of the organizations involved in the tearing down of the outer walls surrounding Isle of Wight Festival 1970.

==White Panther Statement==
In November 1968, &quot;Fifth Estate&quot; published the &quot;White Panther State/meant&quot;. This manifesto, emulating the Black Panthers, ended with a ten-point program:
#We want freedom. We want the power for all people to determine our own destinies.
#We want justice. We want an immediate and total end to all cultural and political repression of the people by the vicious pig power structure and their mad dog lackies the police, courts and military. We want the end of all police and military violence against the people all over the world right now!
#We want a free world economy based on the free exchange of energy and materials and the end of money.
#We want free access to all information media and to all technology for all the people.
#We want a free educational system, utilizing the best procedures and machinery our modern technology can produce, that will teach each man, woman and child on earth exactly what each needs to know to survive and grow into his or her full human potential.
#We want to free all structures from corporate rule and turn the buildings over to the people at once!
#We want free time and space for all humans—dissolve all unnatural boundaries!
#We want the freedom of all prisoners held in federal, state, county or city jails and prisons since the so-called legal system in America makes it impossible for any man to obtain a fair and impartial trial by a jury of his peers.
#We want the freedom of all people who are held against their will in the conscripted armies of the oppressors throughout the world.
#We want free land, free food, free shelter, free clothing, free music, free medical care, free education, free media, EVERYTHING FREE FOR EVERYBODY!

The ten-point program and &quot;White Panther State/meant&quot; were also published in the Ann Arbor Sun, which was a newspaper founded by John Sinclair in November 1968. The newspaper was originally called the Detroit Warren-Forrest Sun before it was changed to the Ann Arbor Sun when Trans-Love Energies moved to Ann Arbor in 1968. The organization, founded by John Sinclair, his wife Leni Arndt Sinclair and artist Gary Grimshaw in 1967, set up shop at 1510 and 1520 Hill St, where the Ann Arbor Sun was produced and edited by the members of the group. On July 28, 1969, the Ann Arbor Sun printed a revised copy of the White Panther&#x27;s ten-point program.

The newspaper was considered to be the mouthpiece for the White Panther Party for quite some time before the newspaper transitioned to an independent publication spreading views on local issues, left-wing politics, music, and arts. Finally in 1976, the publication of the Ann Arbor Sun was suspended indefinitely.
