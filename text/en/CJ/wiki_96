<text>Daylami (20 April 1994 – 5 April 2023) was a Thoroughbred Champion racehorse and sire who was bred in Ireland, but trained in France, Dubai and the United Kingdom. In a career which lasted from 1996 until 1999, he raced in five different countries and won seven Group 1/Grade I races. His 1999 performances earned him the United States&#x27; Eclipse Award for Outstanding Male Turf Horse and the Cartier Racing Award for European Horse of the Year.

==Background==
Daylami, a &quot;powerful&quot; grey horse, standing 17 hands high, was bred in Ireland by his original owner, the Aga Khan, who also bred both of his parents.

Daylami&#x27;s sire, Doyoun, won the 2,000 Guineas and finished third in the Derby, before a stud career in which he produced the winners of over two hundred races. His most notable offspring, apart from Daylami, was the Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf winner Kalanisi.

Daltawa, from whom Daylami inherited his grey coat, was also the dam of the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe winner Dalakhani. She was a member of one of the families established by Marcel Boussac and eventually acquired by the Aga Khan.

He was first sent into training with Alain de Royer-Dupré at Chantilly. At the end of his three-year-old season he was bought by Godolphin and transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. His two most frequent jockeys were Gerald Mosse, and, after the move to Godolphin, Frankie Dettori.

Like many grey horses, Daylami changed in appearance as he aged. In his earliest races he had a dark, iron-grey appearance but looked almost white by the time of his retirement.

==Racing career==

===1996: Two-year-old season===
Daylami did not appear on the racecourse until the September of his two-year-old season, when he won a minor stakes race at Longchamp. Three weeks later, he was moved up in class and won the Listed Prix Herod at Évry. On his final start of the year he was moved up to the highest class to contest the Group One Critérium de Saint-Cloud. Starting favourite as part of a two-horse Aga Khan entry, Daylami was sent into the lead in the straight, but was caught in the closing stages and beaten three quarters of a length by Shaka.

===1997: Three-year-old season===
As a three-year-old, Daylami was campaigned exclusively over one mile. He began by winning his first Group race, beating Loup Sauvage by two lengths in the Prix de Fontainebleau at Longchamp in April. Three weeks later, he beat the same horse, by the same margin, over the same course and distance to win the Group One Poule d&#x27;Essai des Poulains on soft ground, with Godolphin&#x27;s Bahamian Bounty, winner of the Prix Morny and Middle Park Stakes, finishing last of the six runners. Although he had been entered in the Derby, Daylami&#x27;s connections made it clear that the colt would be kept to shorter distances.

The colt was then sent abroad for the first time to contest the Group One St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Daylami&#x27;s striking appearance impressed observers and he was well fancied at 7/2, but in the race he seemed to be outpaced in the closing stages and finished a well-beaten third to Starborough. For his two remaining starts, Daylami returned to France, and continued to be tried over one mile. In both of these races, he proved the best of the three-year-old runners. He reversed the Ascot form with Starborough in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, but was beaten decisively by the four-year-old Spinning World. On his final start of the year, he finished third in a strong renewal of the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp behind Spinning World and Helissio.

===1998: Four-year-old season===
Daylami&#x27;s move to Godolphin in the winter of 1997/8 brought more than a change of location, as his new connections changed the focus of the horse&#x27;s campaign to middle-distance events. (In Europe the term &quot;middle distance&quot; covers races that would be considered &quot;long distance&quot; in North America.) He began promisingly, carrying topweight of 9–4 (130 lbs) to victory at the Curragh in the Tattersalls Gold Cup (then a Group Two race).

He was a beaten favourite on his next run at Royal Ascot, when he finished third to his stable companion Faithful Son in the Group Two Prince of Wales&#x27;s Stakes, but there were excuses for his defeat, as Dettori had been unable to find space for a clear run at a crucial stage in a race that was described as &quot;one big bump&quot;. In addition, Daylami, as a Group One winner, had to carry five pounds more than the winner.

He reversed the form with Faithful Son at level weights to record his most valuable win so far in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown two and a half weeks later. The form of the race was not particularly strong however, with Daylami being the only runner to have previously won a Group One event in Britain, France or Ireland. Most of the attention was drawn by the fact that Saeed bin Suroor was responsible for training Daylami, Faithful Son and Central Park, giving the Godolphin team first, second and third places in a Group One race. For his next start, he was moved up to the mile and a half distance for the first time in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in which he was ridden by Mick Kinane, Dettori having opted to ride Swain. Daylami started at 6/1 and ran up to expectations finishing fourth of the eight runners behind Swain, High-Rise and Royal Anthem.

In September 1998, Daylami was sent to the US for the Man o&#x27; War Stakes at Belmont Park. He raced close behind the leaders for most of the way, before being switched to the outside in the straight. He produced a strong late run to catch Buck&#x27;s Boy in the closing stages and win by one and a quarter lengths. On his final European start of the year, Daylami was brought back to a mile and a quarter and was slightly disappointing, finishing third to the filly Alborada as the 6/5 favourite for the Champion Stakes.

The horse was again sent to the US in November 1998 to contest the Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf at Churchill Downs but was withdrawn after becoming unwell on the morning of the race. The race was won by Buck&#x27;s Boy.

===1999: Five-year-old season===

====Spring====
It is often assumed that thoroughbred racehorses reach their peak at the age of four a belief supported by the weight-for-age scale, which does not allow for any further improvement beyond that age. Daylami however, was still improving (see official ratings below) and in 1999 he had his best season in terms of wins and prize money. This vindicated the decision of his owners to keep him in training after they had decided that the horse had &quot;more to give and... more to prove.&quot; It was also seen as part of a growing trend to keep top class flat racers in training for longer than had been the fashion in the 1970s and 1980s.

His season did not start particularly well. In the Dubai World Cup he was badly hampered, and although staying on strongly, he could finish only fifth to Almutawakel. He was then made favourite for the Tattersalls Gold Cup, which had been promoted to Group One level, but after taking the lead in the straight, he was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten two and a half lengths by the Japanese-bred filly Shiva.

====Summer====
It was from this point on that, Daylami (ridden in all his remaining races by Dettori) showed his best form. At Epsom he was third choice in the betting for the Coronation Cup behind Royal Anthem and the 1998 European Horse of the Year Dream Well, but produced a sustained run in the last quarter-mile to beat those rivals by three quarters of a length and half a length. This was Daylami&#x27;s first win over a mile and a half, but the lack of early pace and slow time of 2:40.26 meant that the race did not conclusively prove his stamina. He had been expected to run in the Eclipse Stakes but was withdrawn from the race when his trainer decided that Daylami &quot;needed more time&quot;. He continued to attract attention however, when beating the Group One winner Central Park by eight lengths in a &quot;sparkling&quot; exercise trial.

In July, he was an easy and &quot;impressive&quot; winner of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, taking the lead over a furlong out and pulling away to win by five lengths. Although Daylami&#x27;s connections were pleased, with Dettori talking enthusiastically about the &quot;ultimate champion&quot;, some observers, including the &quot;Independent&#x27;s&quot; correspondent, were less convinced, pointing out that the field for the King George had been well below its usual standard.

====Autumn====
Daylami ran next in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in which he produced what was probably his best performance. Despite his win at Ascot, Daylami started only second favourite behind Royal Anthem, who had recently won the Group One International Stakes at York by eight lengths. The two horses so dominated the build-up to the race that one prominent bookmaker announced that they would treat the race as a match for betting purposes. After tracking the leaders in the early stages, Daylami moved through &quot;easily&quot; on the inside to take the lead in the straight and drew right away to win by nine lengths from the filly Dazzling Park, with Dream Well third and Royal Anthem fifth. His performance was given a figure of 136 by the official handicapper, the third highest recorded in Europe in the 1990s, behind only Generous and Peintre Celebre.

Daylami was sent to Paris for the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe in October, although his connections made it clear that the heavy ground would not suit their horse and even considered withdrawing him. He made no impression in the race and was eased down by Dettori in the straight, eventually finishing ninth behind Montjeu.

In his final race, Daylami was sent to Florida for the Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf at Gulfstream Park. The venue, with its warm climate and tight, seven-furlong turf circuit was believed to be particularly challenging for European horses, with none of them having won when the Breeders&#x27; Cup was run there in 1989 and 1992. Dettori&#x27;s ability on American tracks had also been questioned after he had ridden a &quot;bizarre&quot; race on Swain in the previous year&#x27;s Classic. Buck&#x27;s Boy led early, and exerted pressure from the front, running 1:10.60 for the first six furlongs. Daylami was always running prominently, and was moved up to third behind Buck&#x27;s Boy and Royal Anthem entering the straight. He produced a powerful late run to take the lead inside the final furlong and stayed on strongly to win by two and a half lengths from Royal Anthem with Buck&#x27;s Boy third. As he returned on Daylami after the race Dettori shouted &quot;What about Swain now!&quot; in reference to the criticism he had received.

Daylami was then retired to stud.

==Assessment==
In the International Classification (the forerunner of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings), for 1998 Daylami was rated on 123, eight pounds behind the top-weighted Skip Away In the Classification for 1999 Daylami was rated the best horse in the world, equal with Montjeu on a rating of 135.

In January 2000, Daylami was awarded the titles of Horse of the Year and Top Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards. In the same month he was named American Champion Male Turf Horse at the Eclipse Awards and finished runner up to Charismatic in the vote for American Horse of the Year, despite having run only once in the United States in the qualifying period.

Daylami earned his owners a $1,000,000 prize as the winner of the inaugural World Series Racing Championship, a competition in which points were awarded for performances in nine major international middle-distance races.

Daylami was given a Timeform rating of 138, making him the equal of Nijinsky and Cigar.
==Stud career==
Through a joint ownership between his breeder, the Aga Khan IV, and Darley Stud, he stood as a sire at the Aga Khan&#x27;s Gilltown Stud near Kilcullen, County Kildare, Ireland until 2006 when he was sent to his Haras de Bonneval stud at Le Mesnil-Mauger in France.

At the end of November 2006, Daylami was sold to Riethuiskraal Stud of South Africa owned by Altus Joubert, Chairman of the South Africa Thoroughbred Breeders&#x27; Association.

In 2010 Daylami returned to Ireland to join Coolagown Stud, near Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland.

Daylami sired the winners of more than four hundred races. The best of his progeny was Grey Swallow, winner of the 2004 Irish Derby and 2005 Tattersalls Gold Cup. His other notable offspring included Voila Ici (Premio Roma, Gran Premio di Milano), Indian Days (Bosphorus Cup x2) and the hurdler Zaynar (Triumph Hurdle). He was pensioned in 2014 and was euthanized on 5 April 2023 due to infirmities of old age.

<text>White Teeth is British author Zadie Smith&#x27;s debut novel, published in 2000. It focuses on the later lives of two wartime friends—the Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and the Englishman Archie Jones—and their families in London. The novel centres on Britain&#x27;s relationship with immigrants from the British Commonwealth.

&quot;White Teeth&quot; won multiple honors, including the 2000 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction, the 2000 Whitbread Book Award in category best first novel, the Guardian First Book Award, the Commonwealth Writers First Book Prize, and the Betty Trask Award. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005. In 2022, it was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Summary==
On New Year&#x27;s Day 1975, Archie Jones, a 47-year-old Englishman whose disturbed Italian wife has just walked out on him, attempts to take his own life by gassing himself in his car when a chance interruption causes him to change his mind. Filled with a fresh enthusiasm for life, Archie flips a coin and then finds his way into the aftermath of a New Year&#x27;s Eve party. There he meets the much-younger Clara Bowden, a Jamaican woman whose mother, Hortense, is a devout Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. Clara had been interested in the unattractive, anti-social Ryan Topps, but their relationship falls apart after Ryan becomes a member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and grows close to her mother. Archie and Clara are soon married and have a daughter, Irie, who grows up to be intelligent but with low self-confidence due to her weight and insecurity about her mixed-race identity.

Also living in Willesden, London; is Archie&#x27;s best friend Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim from Bangladesh; the two men spend much of their time at the O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s pub arguing with the owner, Abdul-Mickey, a Muslim whose entire extended family all suffer from cystic acne. Archie and Samad met in 1945 when they were part of a tank crew inching through Europe in the final days of World War II, though they missed out on the action. Their friendship was cemented when Archie, acting at Samad&#x27;s behest, apparently executed an escaped Nazi scientist whom they had been tasked with turning over to the authorities. Following the war, Samad emigrated to Britain and married Alsana Iqbal, &quot;née&quot; Alsana Begum, or &quot;Miss Alsana&quot;, in a traditional arranged marriage. Samad is a downtrodden waiter in a West End curry house, and is obsessed by the history of his supposed but unlikely great-grandfather, Mangal Pandey, a Hindu soldier from Uttar Pradesh, not Bengal, who is famous for firing the first shot of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (though he missed and was executed).

Samad and Alsana have twin boys, Magid and Millat, who are the same age as Irie. Samad in particular finds it difficult to maintain his devotion to Islam in an English life; he is continually tormented by what he sees as the effects of this cultural conflict upon his own moral character—his Muslim values are corrupted by his compulsive masturbation, beer drinking, and his affair with his children&#x27;s music teacher, Poppy Burt-Jones. In an attempt to preserve his traditional beliefs, he sends 10-year-old Magid to Bangladesh in the hope that he will grow up properly under the teachings of Islam. From then on, the lives of the two boys follow very different paths. To Samad&#x27;s fury, Magid becomes an Anglicised atheist and devotes his life to science. Millat, meanwhile, pursues a rebellious path of womanising, drinking and petty hooliganism—as well as harbouring a love of mob movies such as &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. Angry at his people&#x27;s marginalisation in English society, Millat demonstrates against Salman Rushdie for his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; in 1989 and eventually pledges himself to a militant Muslim fundamentalist brotherhood known as &quot;Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation&quot; (KEVIN).

The lives of the Joneses and Iqbals intertwine with that of the white, middle-class Chalfens, a lapsed Jewish-Catholic family of Oxbridge-educated intellectuals who typify a distinctive strain of North London liberal trendiness, and who are recruited by Irie and Millat&#x27;s school to tutor them after the pair are caught smoking marijuana. The father, Marcus Chalfen, is a university lecturer and geneticist working on a controversial &#x27;FutureMouse&#x27; project in which he introduces chemical carcinogens into the body of a mouse and is thus able to observe the progression of a tumour in living tissue. By re-engineering the actual genome and watching cancers progress at pre-determined times, Marcus believes he is eliminating the random. The mother, Joyce Chalfen, is a horticulturist and part-time housewife with an often entirely misguided desire to mother and &#x27;heal&#x27; Millat as if he were one of her plants. To some extent, the Chalfen family provides a safe haven as they (believe themselves to) accept and understand the turbulent lives of Irie, Magid, and Millat. Irie finds herself working for Marcus as a secretary, Marcus takes an intellectual interest in Magid and subsidizes his flight home, and even Millat&#x27;s grades slightly improve.

However, both Alsana and Clara become suspicious of their children constantly spending time at the Chalfens, and Joyce and Marcus&#x27;s arrogance antagonize both Clara and the Iqbal family. The Chalfens&#x27; actions also comes at the expense of their own son, Joshua, whose difficulties are ignored by his parents. Originally a well-moulded &quot;Chalfenist&quot;, Joshua rebels against his father and his background by joining the radical animal rights group &quot;Fighting Animal Torture and Exploitation&quot; (FATE). Meanwhile, after his return from Bangladesh, Magid works as Marcus&#x27;s research assistant on the FutureMouse project, while Millat becomes further involved in KEVIN. Irie, who has been attracted to Millat since adolescence, has a one-night-stand with him, only for him to reject her due to his KEVIN-inspired beliefs about ritual purity. Dejected, Irie immediately seduces Magid. This causes her to become pregnant, but she is left unsure of the child&#x27;s paternity, as the brothers are identical twins and therefore share the same DNA.

The strands of the narrative grow closer as Millat and KEVIN, Joshua and FATE, and Clara&#x27;s mother Hortense and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses all plan to demonstrate their opposition to Marcus&#x27;s FutureMouse—which they view as an evil interference with their own religious and ethical beliefs—at its exhibition on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1992. At the Perret Institute, Hortense and the other Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses sing loudly in front of the building. Samad goes out to hush them, but when he arrives he cannot summon the heart to make them stop. When he returns, he realizes that the founder of the Perret Institute and the oldest scientist on Marcus Chalfen&#x27;s panel is Dr. Perret, the Nazi he captured during World War II. Enraged that Archie did not kill him all those years ago, Samad runs over and begins cursing Archie. Just then, Millat advances on the table of scientists with a gun. Not wanting Millat to become a murderer, Archie jumps in front of him and takes a bullet in the thigh. As he falls, he crushes the mouse&#x27;s glass cage, and it escapes.

At the novel&#x27;s end, the narrator presents us with different &quot;end games&quot; in the style of a television series finale: since witnesses identify both as the culprit, Magid and Millat are both sentenced to community service working at a new garden project of Joyce&#x27;s. Joshua and Irie end up together and join Hortense in Jamaica in the year 2000 with Irie&#x27;s daughter, who remains ignorant of her true parentage and regards Magid and Millat as her uncles. Mickey opens up the previously men-only O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s pub to women, and Archie and Samad finally invite their wives along with them to celebrate the new millennium.

==Major characters==

===Alfred Archibald Jones===
Archie is mediocre and indecisive, preferring to make his most important decisions with the flip of a coin. Archie&#x27;s ex-wife is Ophelia Diagilo, whom he supposedly drove insane with his mediocrity. He later marries Clara, a Jamaican woman less than half his age, with whom he has a daughter, Irie. Archie&#x27;s best friend is Samad Iqbal. The two men served together in World War II in the British Army and frequently visit O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s pub.

===Samad Miah Iqbal===
Archie&#x27;s best friend, a middle-aged World War II veteran with a crippled right hand. Samad was born in Bangladesh and met Archie when they were soldiers in Eastern Europe. He works as a waiter at an Indian restaurant, where he receives few tips. His wife is Alsana Begum, and his twin sons are Magid and Millat. More than anything, Samad wants his sons to grow into religious, traditional Bengali Muslim men. To ensure this, he goes to great lengths, even sending Magid to be raised in Bangladesh (for all intents and purposes, this was a kidnapping).

===Clara Bowden===
Clara Jones, née Bowden, was an awkward, unpopular Jehovah&#x27;s Witness who spent her adolescence canvassing door-to-door. When she meets the equally unappealing Ryan Topps, she abandons her religion and takes up his rebellious ways, though Ryan becomes a staunch Jehovah&#x27;s Witness himself. When Ryan and Clara crash into a tree on Ryan&#x27;s scooter, Clara&#x27;s top teeth are knocked out. She meets Archie Jones and marries him, even though she finds him unimpressive and he is more than twice her age. Archie and Clara have a daughter named Irie.

===Alsana Begum===
Alsana Iqbal, née Begum, is the young wife of Samad Iqbal, to whom she was promised before her birth. They have twin sons, Magid and Millat. To help pay bills, she sews clothing on her home sewing machine for an S&amp;M shop called Domination in Soho. Although charismatic and judgemental by nature, she thinks marriage is best handled with silence. However, she has a volcanic temper and generally wins fights with Samad by injuring him.

===Irie Ambrosia Jones===
Irie—whose name means &quot;OK, cool, peaceful&quot; in Patois—is the daughter of Clara and Archie Jones. Irie has been friends with Magid and Millat Iqbal since birth. After struggling with her sexuality and racial identity, Irie finds answers in her grandmother, Hortense Bowden. She resolves to go into the field of dentistry and, despite her best efforts to prevent it, ends up with Joshua Chalfen. Having slept with both Magid and Millat, Irie gives birth to a daughter whose father can never be known, as the twins have exactly the same DNA.

Irie is mentioned in passing in two other novels by Zadie Smith, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===Millat Zulfikar Iqbal===
Millat, born two minutes later than his twin brother Magid, is the younger son of Samad and Alsana. After Magid is sent to Bangladesh, Millat comes into his own as a trouble-making, pot-smoking, womanising rebel. However, Millat eventually rejects this lifestyle in favour of fundamentalist Islam, becoming a major driving force of KEVIN. At the FutureMouse conference, he tries to shoot Dr Perret, but instead shoots Archie in the thigh. Millat may or may not be the father of Irie&#x27;s baby.

===Magid Mahfooz Murshed Mubtasim Iqbal===
Magid is the elder son of Samad and Alsana, and twin brother of Millat. Magid is intellectually precocious and insists on dressing and acting like an adult, even at a very young age. Samad essentially kidnaps Magid and sends him to be raised traditionally in Bangladesh. When he finally returns to London, he joins Marcus Chalfen&#x27;s FutureMouse programme. Magid is fascinated by the certainty of fate genetic engineering offers, and by having the power to choose another creature&#x27;s path, as his was chosen for him. Magid may or may not be the father of Irie&#x27;s baby.

===Marcus Chalfen===
Marcus Chalfen is a Jewish genetic engineer and husband of Joyce Chalfen. His controversial FutureMouse experiment involves genetically altering a mouse so that it develops cancers at specific times and sites. Marcus loses interest in mentoring Irie when he begins corresponding with Magid, and condescendingly advises that Irie is only intelligent enough to be a dentist.

===Joyce Chalfen===
Joyce is a horticulturalist, writer, and the wife of Marcus Chalfen. She has four sons, all of whom adore her fiercely. Joyce is a natural nurturer and constantly feels the need to care for things and people. From the moment they meet, Millat entrances Joyce, and she feels the need to mother him and pander to his needs, which Millat exploits.

===Joshua Chalfen===
Joshua is the son of Joyce and Marcus Chalfen. Originally interested in his studies at Glenard Oak School, Joshua rebels against the Chalfens (particularly his father) by joining the animal-rights groups FATE. Joshua has a long-standing crush on Irie and, later, on Joely, who along with husband Crispin head the group. He stays in FATE largely as an excuse to remain close to her.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;White Teeth&quot; was generally well-received among the British press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;TLS&quot; review under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the novel an average rating of 7.8 out of 10 based on reviews from multiple British newspapers. According to &quot;Book Marks&quot;, primarily from American publications, the book received a &quot;positive&quot; consensus, based on six critic reviews: three &quot;rave&quot;, two &quot;positive&quot;, and one &quot;mixed&quot;. 

Though, generally, the book was critically acclaimed, the critic James Wood was largely hostile, while reserving a few moments for praise. The novel has since been the subject of numerous scholarly articles.

In 2019, the novel was ranked 39th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. On 5 November 2019, &quot;BBC News&quot; included &quot;White Teeth&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Adaptations==
A four-part television adaptation of the novel was made and broadcast on Channel 4 in 2002, &quot;White Teeth&quot;. It was directed by Julian Jarrold, starring Om Puri as Samad and Phil Davis as Archie. Each episode focuses on a major male character as he encounters a turning point in his life: &quot;The Peculiar Second Marriage of Archie Jones&quot;, &quot;The Temptation of Samad Iqbal&quot;, &quot;The Trouble With Millat&quot;, and &quot;The Return of Magid Iqbal&quot;.

In 2018, London&#x27;s Kiln Theatre announced the world premiere of Stephen Sharkey&#x27;s stage adaptation of the novel. Directed by the venue&#x27;s Artistic Director Indhu Rubasingham, the production featured 13 original songs by Paul Englishby and starred Tony Jayawardena as Samad, Richard Lumsden as Archie and Ayesha Antoine as Irie.

<text>Mananthavady is a Grade 3 municipality in the Wayanad district of Kerala, India. The municipal boundaries are defined by Tirunelli Panchayat to the north, Kabani River to the east and south, and Thavinhal Panchayat to the west. Mananthavady is the third largest town in Wayanad District, following Kalpetta and Sulthan Bathery. It is situated 35 km northeast of the district headquarters, Kalpetta, 80 km east of Thalassery, and 110 km northeast of Kozhikode.

==Etymology== 
The popular view on the etymology is that the word is derived from &quot;Maane Eytha Vady&quot; (English: &quot;The place where an arrow was shot at the deer&quot;). This view is strengthened by the existence of a place called &quot;Ambukuthy&quot;, literally &quot;the location where the arrow pierced&quot;, on the outskirts of the town.

== History ==

=== Early History ===
From the dawn of the Neolithic Age, Wayanad has been home to a culturally rich population. The prehistoric period of the region is evidenced through the myths and traditions of various indigenous groups found here. According to an inscription found in Edakkal Cave, it appears that the Girivar tribe governed Wayanad in ancient times. The last rulers of this tribe were Arippan and Vettan, two family members of the same lineage. All the northern territories of Panamaram were under the rule of King Arippan. It was through the deceit of the Kumbala Maippadi King that the Vettan dynasty eventually lost its prominence.

Various tribes such as the Paniyar, Mullakurumar, Ooralaikkurumar, Kattu Naikkar, Adiyan, and Kurichiyar have been present in different parts of Wayanad for centuries. The Paniyar, who were permanent settlers in the mountains, and the Kurumbar, known for their prominence in the Vettan dynasty, along with the Naga Makkal of Ooralaikkurumar and the Adiyan, descendants of Keeoruthiyan and Melorachavan, are noted for their significant cultural heritage. Among these, the Adiyan tribe is most commonly found in Mananthavady after Tirunelli. The region surrounding Mananthavady is associated with myths of the Adiyan tribe connected to Thirunelli and Pakki. Their rich tradition of storytelling and singing is well known.

Mananthavady houses numerous sites related to the Paniyar tribe, extending from Palakkad to Malappuram. The Valliyoor Kavu temple, in particular, has a special place reserved for them. The Ooralaikkurumar, known for their skills in craftsmanship among the indigenous tribes, can be found in places like Tholpetty, Begur, Appapara, Panamaram, Kalpetta, Pulppally, and Mullanthara in Mananthavady. They self-produce all the essential tools and materials required by human society.

Kurichiyars, who were companions of the Pazhassi Raja, provide clear evidence that the early inhabitants of Wayanad understood the use of the wheel from ancient times. This is supported by the discovery of a wooden wheel from the riverbanks of Wayanad. Wayanad is one of the few ancient centres in India where trees were carved into circular shapes, cut into wheels, and fitted onto axles to create vehicles. An inscription from the 5th century AD by Vishnusharma is found in Edakkal Cave.

=== Regional Administration History ===
According to the inscription found in Edakkal Cave, the Girivar tribe was the governing authority in Wayanad during ancient times. The last rulers of this tribe were Arippan and Vettan, two family members from the same lineage. All the northern territories of Panamaram were under the rule of King Arippan. The Vettan dynasty eventually fell due to the deceit of the Kumbala Maippadi King. In 1810, the history of Wayanad was compiled and recorded orally by the Malabar District Court. This is also noted in Mackenzie’s manuscripts.

After the downfall of the Vettan rulers, the Kottayam Raja began governing Wayanad, having also seized the rights of the Parrayikkumithal Mādampi. During Hyder Ali&#x27;s invasion, Ravi Varma, the Raja of Kottayam, sought refuge in Travancore with his family. During the second Mysore invasion, Ravi Varma returned with a military force and regained control of Wayanad. After the war, Wayanad was divided into several regions, with Ilamkur being part of the present-day Mananthavady. Vemooth Nambiar was the Mādampi (local ruler) of this region.

On March 18, 1792, the Treaty between the East India Company and Tipu Sultan transferred the sovereignty of Malabar to the British. Since the Company did not comply with the condition of handing over authority to local rulers, Pazhassi Raja took a strong stand against it. To subdue Pazhassi Raja, the British authorities employed various strategies. By the end of April 1805, Pazhassi Raja was unable to hold his ground. With the takeover of the Company’s forces by the Malabar Sub-Collector T.H. Baber, Pazhassi Raja’s position became increasingly precarious. On November 30, 1805, he met his heroic end in Mavilathottam at Pulppally. His body was brought to Mananthavady the next day under heavy guard and was interred at Thazhankari with Brahmin rituals. The stone monument erected by the British and the tree that grew on it still stand as historical witnesses. To preserve the memories of the battles and to store ammunition, the British also constructed a gunpowder magazine near Chuttakkadavu, which still stands today despite its weathered condition. Pazhassi Raja died at the age of 47. With his fall, the Kurichiyapad was plundered.

In 1856, Robinson&#x27;s report indicated that the Ilamkur division, including Mananthavady, was re-divided into new administrative sections, including Vemooth and Tirunelli. By 1830, private coffee plantations were already present around Mananthavady, but it was Pugh, a Ceylonese, who started coffee plantations in Mananthavady around 1835. The initial coffee plantation was started by soldiers stationed in Mananthavady as a form of rest work. In 1854, tea plantations began in Chirakkara and Jessia. By 1892, Pyari &amp; Company established a foothold in the area. According to William Logan&#x27;s Malabar Manual of 1887, Mananthavady had offices of the Deputy Collector, Police Inspector, Sub Registrar, and Sub Assistant Conservator, among others. There were also government-run middle schools and a post office in Mananthavady. Before 1886, medical officers in Mananthavady were Europeans. There was also a club for Europeans and a canteen selling necessary goods.

During the early days of the East India Company&#x27;s rule, Mananthavady was under the Talassery Sub-Collector. Later, during the British government’s rule, it came under the authority of a specific Deputy Collector. From 1859 to 1879, the Deputy Collector of Mananthavady had civil powers. In 1859, with the formation of the Forest Department, the forests of Wayanad were divided into 14 blocks. A forest officer, a Sub Assistant Conservator, and 20 forest guards were appointed for district forest management, with the Sub Assistant Conservator&#x27;s office located in Mananthavady. The Mananthavady Panchayat was formed in 1935. The regions of Kaniyaram and Ozhakkodi were not included in the Panchayat at that time. The Panchayat had an area of about twenty square kilometres.

=== Socio-Cultural History ===
The agricultural characteristics of the Wayanad region, known for its fertile lands, are reflected in the agricultural sector of the Mananthavady Panchayat. Most of the agricultural lands in Mananthavady were under the jurisdiction of the Sreevalliyurkkav Devaswom and the Koilery Vadyoor Devaswom. Landowners included Brahmins, Chettiyars, and Goudas, along with tenants. The tenant-landlord relationship, which existed in earlier times, was managed through a system of rent payment in paddy, which was equivalent to the seed required for cultivation. The rate for irrigated land was five rupees per acre.

The agricultural workers for the landowners included Paniyans, Kurichiyars, Adiyans, and Kurumbas. Migration began actively in the 1930s and continued into the 1960s, with rice cultivation being the main agricultural activity. The Mananthavady Panchayat consists of Hindus, Christians, Muslims, Jains, and other groups, including Yadavs, Chettiyars, and Tamil Brahmins. The onset of World War II led to food shortages, causing an influx of Christian families from Todupuzha, Muvattupuzha, and Palai into various parts of the Panchayat. During Tipu Sultan&#x27;s military campaign, the settlers of the Panchayat included families from the region and subsequent Muslim immigrants.

The indigenous communities in the Panchayat are known for their superior and diverse cultural heritage. Mananthavady was once a region with abundant wild animals. Many of the places in the Mananthavady town, which are now densely populated, were once thick forests. Roads, bridges, and electricity were very limited. Authorities took necessary measures to light up the important locations in the Panchayat at night. There was bus service to Talassery, Kozhikode, and Mysore. During World War II, when there was a shortage of petrol, buses operated using bullocks and horses. Seeking medical treatment from Krishna Vaidyan in Vadakara was a common practice for the people of Mananthavady. The malaria epidemic that affected Wayanad also reached Mananthavady. In 1946-47, there was a suspected plague outbreak, leading to the closure of Mananthavady town and the destruction of roofs of houses to eradicate rats.

Many notable local freedom fighters were active in the Panchayat. Early cinema screenings in Mananthavady were conducted through touring talkies, with the main center being in Ampukuthy. A well-known place of worship in Mananthavady is Valliyoor Kavu, which follows Dravidian architectural style. The first Christian temple, Amaloothbhava Devalayam, was established in 1848. Initially, there was a small church at the present site and another church in Pathivayal, intended for worship by converts from the Kurichiyar community. Later, temples for different communities, including Jains and Yadavs, were built in various regions. The Pattanipalli Mosque and the Muslim mosque in the town were among the first of their kind. The worship practices of different indigenous communities and their distinct temples add to the cultural uniqueness of the Panchayat.

==Transportation==
The Thalassery–Bavali Road passes through Mananthavady and is the town&#x27;s main road, allowing connection to Mysore, Karnataka. The road to Mysore through Nagarhole National Park has been declared a National Highway by the central government; it is parallel to the Kabini River, night travel in this road is regulated so that the road is closed from 6PM to 6AM. The highway goes from Kainatty (at the junction of NH 766) to Mysore via Bavali, Jayapura. Another road permits access to Gonikoppal, Kodagu district, away via Kartikulam, Tholpetty forest, Kutta and Ponnampet.

==Climate==
Mananthavady experiences a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by moderate temperatures and high humidity. The monsoon season brings significant rainfall, which supports the region&#x27;s lush greenery and agricultural activities. The weather is generally pleasant, with temperatures ranging from mild to warm throughout the year.

== Notable Landmarks ==
Edakkal Caves: These ancient caves are renowned for their prehistoric petroglyphs and inscriptions, providing insights into the early history of the region.

Valliyoor Kavu Temple: An important religious site known for its Dravidian architectural style and historical significance.

Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s Resting place: The Pazhassi Tomb and Museum, a significant memorial dedicated to one of Kerala’s esteemed heroes, is located in Mananthavady.

<doc id="1114801" wikidata="Q3228632" url="?curid=1114801" title="League Leaders' Shield">
<text>The League Leaders&#x27; Shield is a trophy awarded to the team finishing the season top of Super League in the sport of rugby league football. This regular portion of the season precedes the playoffs for the eventual Super League Grand Final. The trophy was first awarded in Super League VII in 2002.

St Helens won the first shield in 2002, and have since won the shield on a total of 9 occasions.

Wigan Warriors become only the 2nd team (along with St Helens), to retain the shield.

==History==
From 1907 until 1973 the Championship was awarded to the team winning a top-four play-off (excluding the 2 seasons 1962–63 and 1963–64, when the championship was awarded to the top-placed team). From 1907 to 1962 no prize was awarded to the team finishing top. From 1965 to 1973 a &#x27;League Leaders&#x27; Trophy&#x27; was introduced to reward the team finishing top. In 1996, Super League was formed but continued to use the league to decide the champions until 1998, when they adopted a play-off structure for the championship. Between 1998 and 2001 no trophy was awarded for coming top of the league in the regular season, and it would not be until the 2002 season when the League Leaders&#x27; Shield was first awarded.

From 2015 to 2017, League Leaders&#x27; Shield winners would participate in the short lived World Club Series. 2015 also saw the prize money increase from £50,000 to £100,000. 

In 2016, the League Leaders were awarded medals for the first time.

<doc id="1114802" wikidata="Q1152304" url="?curid=1114802" title="Tyrian (video game)">
<text>Tyrian is a vertically scrolling shooter developed by Eclipse Software for MS-DOS and published in 1995 by Epic MegaGames. &quot;Tyrian&quot; was programmed by Jason Emery, illustrated by Daniel Cook, and its music composed by Alexander Brandon and Andras Molnar. The game was re-released as freeware in 2004. A free and open-source port of the game started in April 2007.

==Plot==

The game is set in the year 20,031. The player takes on the role of Trent Hawkins, a skilled spaceship pilot. While on the planet Tyrian, a hostile drone shoots his best friend, Buce Quesillac. Before dying Buce warns Trent that the drone belonged to the militaristic MicroSol megacorporation. MicroSol has discovered Gravitium (the game&#x27;s brand of Unobtainium) on Tyrian and seeks to keep it a secret. Now on MicroSol&#x27;s hit list, Trent manages to secure a small, armed spacecraft and set out to the free world of Savara.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Tyrian&quot; is an arcade-style vertical scrolling shooter. It was developed chiefly as a homage to the works of Compile, particularly their &quot;Zanac&quot; series.

The player controls a space ship fitted with different weapons (front and back, linked to the same button, and up to two external pods with their own buttons) and other equipment. The game presents a variety of enemies (some flying, some fixed, some on rails) and bosses, with many occurrences of fixed and/or indestructible obstacles. Before the player&#x27;s starship is destroyed it must take enough damage to exhaust several points of shields (which regenerate over time) and armor.

&quot;Tyrian&#x27;s&quot; full game mode features a credit and equipment-buying system, and the shield/armor hit points which are similar to game mechanics in &quot;&quot;, another PC game from the same period. The arcade mode has characteristics from coin-op arcade shooters, such as in-game powerups and extra lives.

===Difficulty===
There are three levels of difficulty to choose from: Easy, Medium, and Hard, as well as the hidden options of Impossible, Suicide, and Lord of the Game. Hard difficulty and above employ enemies with more health as well as fire more bullets per second. Certain hidden levels are only available at hard difficulty, which provide ample opportunities for unique powerups and upgrades. In certain levels, the Hard setting also prevents the player from seeing enemies outside a conical line-of-sight. Upon completion of the game, the player receives a password for one of the several hidden ships, as well as the options for replaying the game at a higher difficulty setting.

===Full story mode===

The &quot;full story mode&quot; is a single player mode that features a story-based campaign and ship customization. The story is told through the message cubes that can be collected within and read between levels. Some of these messages cubes are readily available while others need to be obtained by destroying certain enemies in the preceding level. At certain points in the game, the storyline branches and the player is required to pick one branch.

The player&#x27;s craft is customizable. It can accommodate a front weapon and a rear weapon. Shops can supply a variety of kinetic guns, rayguns, missiles, and bombs for these two slots. While the front weapons are mostly limited to forward arcs, &quot;rear&quot; weapons often come with wider coverage including side and rear shots. Some rear weapons have two selectable fire modes, focusing either mostly forward, or mostly sideways or rearward.

Weapons can be upgraded up to 10 times. Higher levels cost exponentially more and require a more powerful generator to support them. Other upgrades include increased shields, more powerful generators to allow for stronger weapons and shields, more armor, and higher maneuverability. Shops differ in terms of the ships, generators, and weapons they have for sale. However, shops can upgrade any component, even those that they don&#x27;t sell.

The player can also purchase up to two &quot;sidekicks&quot; which fly alongside the ship. Some simply act as a complementary weapon that fire whenever the ship fires; others are powerful weapons with limited ammunition that need to manually activated. Sidekicks may not be upgradable.

===Arcade mode===
In arcade mode, the player starts with a moderate ship and picks up the front guns, rear guns, and sidekicks along the way, instead of purchasing them. Front weapons are upgraded by picking up purple bubbles from destroyed enemies. The number of purple orbs required increases exponentially to advance to higher power levels. Front and rear guns can also be upgraded to the next level by picking up power-up pods, which are found by destroying a specific enemy. The ship, shields, and generators are not upgradeable.

The arcade mode can be played with one or two ships, by one or two players. The ships are called the &quot;Dragonhead&quot; and &quot;Dragonwing&quot;. Both players can combine their ships into one, forming the &quot;Steel Dragon&quot;, with the first player controlling the combined ship, and the second player controlling a turret. Tyrian enables the two players to be connected via modem.

The Dragonhead has front gun powerups (with more variety than the Dragonwing&#x27;s rear gun pickups), has better maneuverability, and a smaller profile making it easier to dodge enemy fire. It also controls the &quot;special&quot; power-up weapons such as the Soul of Zinglon or Repulsor. The Dragonwing is larger and slower but more heavily armored. It picks up the rear power-ups, although unlike the equivalent single-player rear gun, the Dragonwing fires it mostly forward instead of the side or rear. The Dragonwing also controls the sidekick weapons. The player can also increase the power of the Dragonwing&#x27;s weapon by not firing them for short time, letting them to accumulate extra charges. There are five charge levels for each weapon, and collecting the spherical purple powerups gives the Dragonwing the ability to charge-up faster.

===Timed battle===
In this mode, available in Tyrian 2000 only, the player chooses from three levels to play in (Deliani, Space station, and Savara). The player is given a set time to complete the level, while collecting power-ups, fighting off enemies and killing the boss. When the level is complete, the score is calculated depending on time spent, ship&#x27;s integrity, destruction caused, and enemies killed.

===Super arcade===
The game also features 7 (9 in Tyrian 2000) hidden &quot;super arcade&quot; modes with specialized ships, requiring the user to type in certain codewords which are shown after beating the game. (The first code is given by beating the regular game, and each consecutive code is given after beating the mode which comes before it.)

===Super Tyrian===
This mode, which is enabled by typing &quot;engage&quot; at the title screen, disables all cheat codes and command parameters and sets the difficulty to Lord of Game (or Suicide if the Scroll Lock key is held down). The player possesses a Stalker 21.126 ship, along with a small shield and only one weapon, the Atomic Rail Gun. No other weapons are available; however the ship is able to generate many different weapons when the player performs particular sequences of movements and weapon-firing. The &quot;headlight effect&quot; is always turned on in Super Tyrian, which can obscure objects that are not within a 90-degree field of view in front of the player&#x27;s ship.

===Mini-games===
&quot;Destruct&quot; is a minigame concealed inside &quot;Tyrian&quot;, reminiscent of &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;, with human-vs-human and human-vs-computer modes of play. It can be played by typing &quot;destruct&quot; at the main menu screen.

In the &quot;Zinglon&#x27;s Ale&quot; mini-game, players must try to gather as much ale as possible, while dodging wave after wave of bouncing enemies, and clearing the screen of enemies fully before advancing to the next level. If not cleared, the game continues infinitely while growing ever harder.

&quot;Zinglon&#x27;s Squadrons&quot; is a mini-game similar to Galaxian or Galaga. Large formations of ships fly down to attack. Individual ships in the groups break off to fly down in various ways. Players must destroy the whole fleet to advance to the next fleet.

In the mini-game &quot;Zinglon&#x27;s Revenge&quot; a giant ship projects a horizontal field of energy. Small enemies fall down from above and bounce around the edges of the screen and against the energy field. Touching the field or one of the small enemies could be deadly. Players must shoot all the small enemies to advance to the next level.

==Development==
&quot;Tyrian&quot; was developed by a credited total of 11 people, with &quot;three main drivers&quot; — Alexander Brandon (composer and writer), Jason Emery (programmer and level designer), and Daniel Cook (artist and interface designer). For the aforementioned developers, &quot;Tyrian&quot; was their first commercial video game.

The origins of &quot;Tyrian&quot; began as an experiment in 1991, with a young Jason Emery showing his friend Alexander Brandon the preliminary workings of a scrolling background. The two continued developing, and eventually decided the work could be shown to a game company. Brandon wrote a proposal document and sent it to the two leading shareware game publishers of the time, Epic MegaGames and Apogee. However, the game lacked any sound or music, and the graphics were &quot;definitely not professional&quot;. As such, &quot;neither got overly excited&quot;, but both showed interest.

The two developers thought they would never find a publisher. However, after a long wait, Robert Allen—head of Safari Software—considered &quot;Tyrian&quot; to fit perfectly with their company, which handled smaller scale projects. Robert Allen had word from Cliff Bleszinski that &quot;Tyrian&quot; was very similar to &quot;Zanac&quot;, thinking that it should be followed up.

Robert Allen gave leads to sound coders and artists, the first being Bruce Hsu who created interface graphics and character faces. Artist Daniel Cook was hired after composer Alexander Brandon showed interest in his artwork, which was—unbeknown to Cook—&quot;sent around&quot; by a friend. After he was sent a short list of levels, Cook created sample artwork on an Amiga 1200. It was met with praise by the other developers, who asked him to &quot;make some more!&quot;. The artwork was completed in a 4-month period.

After work began on graphics, the popularity of &quot;Tyrian&quot; rose at Epic MegaGames. Arturo Sinclair from Storm Front Studios joined to create rendered artwork for planets and character faces. The developers wanted a &quot;simple and fun&quot; interface, and changed it at least three times before deciding on a final design. At this point, &quot;Tyrian&quot; was almost complete; with the &quot;Loudness&quot; sound system, near-completed sound effects, and a marketing plan head by Mark Rein. At this time, Tim Sweeney approached the team and informed them &quot;Tyrian&quot; was to be published as a full-fledged Epic MegaGames product. It was later released in 1995.

The data cubes found in the game&#x27;s Full Mode contain various references to its parent publishers, including One Must Fall 2097, Jazz Jackrabbit, and Pretzel Pete (Tyrian 2000). The Pretzel Pete Truck and its weapon is a reference to the Pretzel Pete video game.

==Versions and re-releases==

===Tyrian===
Version 1.0 of the game was originally released as shareware on September 14, 1995, consisting of episode 1 of the game. Released one month later on October 26, Version 1.1 was the first published registered version, consists of the first three episodes, and includes various bugfixes. The registered version also includes the ship editor, which was later available as separate download. Version 2.0 added Episode 4 (An End to Fate) and several new game modes, like the two-player mode. Version 2.01/2.1 fixed some keyboard bugs and includes the &quot;Christmas mode&quot;, triggered by starting the game in December.

===Tyrian 2000 (3.0)===
In 1999, &quot;Tyrian&quot; was re-released as &quot;Tyrian 2000&quot;, which includes an additional fifth episode and bug fixes.

Additional ships include Phoenix II, Storm, Red Dragon, Pretzel Pete Truck (from the Pretzel Pete video game published by XSIV Games). The datacube &quot;TRANSMISSION SOURCE: Epic MegaGames&quot; game and was renamed &quot;TRANSMISSION SOURCE: XSIV Games&quot; with a Pretzel Pete game ad (however, other references to Epic MegaGames titles remain).

Although it claims Windows compatibility, this is achieved using a .PIF file, not by building a native Windows application.

===Game Boy releases===
World Tree Games developed versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. After the publisher Symmetry Entertainment closed down, the European publisher Stealth Productions, Inc. (Stealth Media Group, Inc.) obtained the publication rights, but the game was cancelled.

Both Game Boy versions were eventually released in compiled format in 2007 as freeware by World Tree Games.

In the Game Boy Color version, the Full Game incorporates a shorter story (from Episodes 1-4) than the original DOS game, but planet Ixmucane core always gets destroyed at the end, and the levels were redesigned. The rear weapon from the DOS game is not available. The player can carry two Sidekick weapons at once, but only one is usable at a time. New game modes and items can be unlocked by purchasing Extras using credits obtained by completing a stage.

The Game Boy Advance version incorporates graphics from the DOS game, but the level layout and game play are based on the Game Boy Color game. Two Sidekick weapons can be fired at the same time. Super Arcade and audio are not included. New to this game is Challenge mode, where additional levels are unlocked by completing existing Challenge levels.

===OpenTyrian===
In February 2007 the Pascal (and x86 assembly) source code for &quot;Tyrian&quot; was delegated to a small group of developers to re-write it in C, in a project named OpenTyrian, licensed under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later. Jason Emery released Tyrian in 2007, along with some Game Boy and Game Boy Advance versions. Following that announcement, in April 2007 Daniel Cook announced the free availability of his Tyrian artwork (not including the later work for the Game Boy Color edition and for Tyrian 2000) under generic liberal terms of the open content Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. OpenTyrian was originally stored on the BitBucket repository before moving on to GitHub.

==Audio==
The music of &quot;Tyrian&quot; was created by Alexander Brandon with additional music by Andras Molnar, and is in the LDS (Loudness Sound System) format. The &quot;Tyrian 2000&quot; CD includes 25 of the tracks in red book audio format. The red book tracks are omitted from the freeware version due to the download size. The tracks &quot;ZANAC3&quot; and &quot;ZANAC5&quot; are reproductions of two songs from the MSX/NES game &quot;Zanac&quot;.

Alexander Brandon released the music of &quot;Tyrian&quot; for free in August 2010.

==Reception==
The game mostly received positive reviews. &quot;Tyrian&quot; scored 87% in &quot;PC Gamer&quot; (one percent below their Editor&#x27;s Choice award). A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; complimented the use of a shop system for acquiring powerups, the ability to save games at any time, and the inclusion of a storyline to provide a reason behind &quot;killing everything you see.&quot; He scored the game four out of five stars. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated &quot;Tyrian&quot; as &quot;Action Game of the Year&quot;. The original developers Jason Emery and Alexander Brandon considered &quot;Tyrian&quot;&#x27;s reception &quot;far more&quot; than their expectations.

<text>Larabanga () is a town in West Gonja district, a district in the Savannah Region of Ghana. It is known for its whitewashed adobe Sahelian mosque, said to date from 1421, and which, having been built at the height of the trans-Saharan trade, is reputed to be Ghana&#x27;s oldest mosque and houses a copy of the Qur&#x27;an almost as old.

The Town is also known for its Mystic Stone, for its patterned vernacular architecture, and as the entrance to the Mole National Park.

==Legend of the Mystic Stone==
During British rule, there was a road that was laid near the Larabanga Mosque. A stone was removed during the process to make way for the road. The next day, the stone was found again on the same place it was displaced from. The stone was again removed and the same thing happened the next day. Later, the officials decided to build the road around the stone and it became known as the Mystic Stone.

<doc id="1114811" wikidata="Q584001" url="?curid=1114811" title="Redcliff, Zimbabwe">
<text>Redcliff is a town situated in the Midlands Province of Zimbabwe, with a population of 41,526 (as of 2022). It lies about north-east of Bulawayo.

The town sits in an extremely iron-rich area, and has relied on steel production as a source of revenue since it was founded in the early part of the 20th century. The Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO, formerly RISCO, founded in 1942), which is based in Redcliff, was the town&#x27;s largest employer until it closed down in 2008.

==History==

=== Education ===
The only school in Redcliff in the 1980s was Redcliff Primary School, which offered education to children aged around 5 to 13. The school had three classes per grade classified by colours: red, blue and green. Around 1987, as the population of Redcliff increased. An additional class was added in most streams. School sports played at the school included hockey, swimming, rugby, cricket, rounders, netball and soccer.

Currently, schools in the town include, Redcliff Primary School, George Hill Primary School, Zisco High School (formerly Drake Secondary School), Batanai High School and Rutendo High School.

===Sports===

The town has had sport success stories in soccer, rugby, basketball and athletics, benefitting from infrastructure including Zisco Club and Torwood &quot;Mugomba&quot; Stadium.

From the 1970s through to the mid-1990s, Ziscosteel F.C. was one of the country&#x27;s best soccer teams. It had George Chieza of the Chieza family, Ephraim Moloi-Pikanegore, Abdul Njonga and the late Dr. Muganhiri. Ephraim Moloi-Pikanegore played for the national team and went on to be named in Zimbabwe’s best XI as he was known as “a player with the Midas touch”. This because each and every club he played for won the league and other trophies/cups. He played for Zimbabwean giants Highlanders FC and Zimbabwe Saints FC before he moved to play for Ziscosteel FC. Moloi-Pikanegore then went on to coach Ziscosteel FC and under his tutelage the team produced talented players such as Issa Phiri, Santo Phiri, Herbert Chilembo, Ephraim Dzimbiri, Paul Gundani, Kennedy Nagoli, Abraham Senda, Ronny Jowa and Thamsanqa Thambo to name but a few of the players who represented the Zim national team. Another notable Football mentor from Redcliff is Benedict Moyo who coached the ladies national team and also ran a Football academy in the town. Other notable players to be produced in Redcliff include Clarkson Dzimbiri, Addluck Dzimbiri, Akim Dzimbiri, Kevin Nhodza, Nakai “Cheche” &amp; Tryan “Ponki” Vakavisser.

Zisco Rugby club also enjoyed success in the national league. It enjoyed success from players like Chunky Lewis, Christopher Bishi, Simon Mushaninga, Charlton Sibanda and Sabelo Mangena. Later on a new generation of younger players enjoyed short lived success due to financial difficulties. This young generation of players included Arnold Mutemeri, Zivai and Tafadzwa Mukuruva, David and Amon Bishi, Takesure Masanga, Prince Humbira, Phillip Tafirenyika, Robert Silubonde and many more.

Basketball has also been a success on the domestic level. &#x27;Iron Shooters&#x27; which was formed by Ricardo Chieza and Benjamin Karigambe, included Terence Machando, Jones Masikito, Nsoro Mzemba, Henry Kupakuwana, Tawanda Tangwanda, Tinashe Masawi and Andrew Sibili. What made it remarkable was that even though they were in their early teens, in high school education and didn&#x27;t have any sponsorship, they still managed to play club &#x27;giants&#x27; of the time like the Thornhill Air Force team etc. The team later changed its name to Redcliff &#x27;Steelers&#x27; from Ziscosteel. Steelers would get spornsorship from Afdis and were named &#x27;Nicoli Kinicks&#x27; for two seasons. With the departure of Ricardo Chieza, Benjamin Karigambe, Terence Machando and Jones Masikito in 1997, the team remodelled and took its old name of Redcliff Steelers . They then dominated Midlands Basketball with players like Tinashe Masawi, Greaterman Mudzengi, Lazarus “KC” Kaizare and Trynos Moyo. Steelers went on to qualify for the Sprite National Basketball League in 2000 as Midlands Basketball Champions. Steelers ladies were also formed and won a number of accolades with ladies Mavis Saladi, Tafadzwa Makunike and Linda Mzemba representing the Midlands Province. 
Zisco Athletics teams produced many talented athletes, Christopher Madzokere, Stanley Mandebele, Melusi Ndlela, Tinos Maridza, Patson Muderedzi, Sam Madzinga and Mark Fanucci all of whom were members of Zisco&#x27;s 4×100- and 4×400-metre relay team. These five athletes represented Zisco, the Midlands province and Zimbabwe at international competitions including the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia.

The Redcliff Cricket County was then founded by Portipher Banda (Vice Captain), Osborn Nayoto (Coach), Brian Gwinji (Sponsor) and Dobson Mutemeri (Team Scorer) in the early 2000s. The club went on to produce players who represented the Midlands provincial team known as The Haggie Rhinos. These players, among others, included Portipher Banda, Sean Silubonde and Justin Lewis. Cricket also was introduced to Redcliff Primary School via an initiative by the founding members of the Redcliff Cricket County and sponsorship from the Midlands Cricket Union. Three Redcliff cricket players represented the Midlands Team Under 15 in 1992, Charles Zimbowa, Thabane Mazabane and Bond Nayoto.

==Water Reticulation==

Redcliff has no direct water source and is provided with water via the Kwekwe network. There have been multiple problems with payments of water bills. 
ZiscoSteel helped in the funding of Sebakwe Dam which supplies Kwekwe with water. Since the closure of ZiscoSteel, Kwekwe has switched off Redcliff numerous times.

Since the shutdown of a major firm (Ziscosteel) the standard of living of the majority became so tough, now people are relying on buying and selling, gold panning, selling scrap metal and coal.

<doc id="1114816" wikidata="Q939808" url="?curid=1114816" title="Adeline Software International">
<text>Adeline Software International was a video game developer founded in February 1993 as a subsidiary company of Delphine Software International, and based in Lyon, France. The team mostly came from Infogrames, another French video game company, after a disagreement about sequels of the &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; bestseller.

== History ==
The company employed 21 people including graphic artists, developers and musicians. Five members made up the core of the team: Frédérick Raynal (creative director), Yaël Barroz (computer artist in charge of scenery), Didier Chanfray (artistic director), Serge Plagnol (technical director), and Laurent Salmeron (resource manager).

After the release of &quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; in 1997, the company slowly went quiet, and in July, the core team was sold to Sega, becoming No Cliché and leaving Adeline as an empty group within Delphine.

Years after the apparent demise of Adeline, the brand was revived in 2002 by Delphine, and put it in charge of the development of &quot;Moto Racer Advance&quot;, released for the Game Boy Advance. However, no members from the original Adeline staff were involved in the development. This new team at Adeline was also tasked with developing the game &quot;Flashback Legend&quot;, a sequel to the &quot;Flashback&quot; series which ended up being cancelled during 2003. The liquidation of Delphine in July 2004 marked the definite death of Adeline.

A third Little Big Adventure game has been a talking topic since 2000.

<doc id="1114818" wikidata="Q314511" url="?curid=1114818" title="Gunnar Gren">
<text>Johan Gunnar Gren (; 31 October 1920 – 10 November 1991) was a Swedish professional football player and coach. He is best remembered for playing for IFK Göteborg and AC Milan.

A creative forward, known for his technical skill, vision, tactical intelligence, and passing ability as a playmaker, he was part of the famous &quot;Gre-No-Li&quot; trio of forwards at Milan and the Sweden national team. He was also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, as an offensive–minded central midfielder, known as the &quot;mezzala&quot; role in Italian football jargon, or even as a striker.

A full international between 1940 and 1958, he won 57 caps and scored 32 goals for the Sweden men&#x27;s national team. He was a part of the Sweden team that won gold at the 1948 Summer Olympics, as well as the team that finished second at the 1958 FIFA World Cup. In 1946, he was awarded Guldbollen as Sweden&#x27;s best footballer of the year. Gren is considered to be one of Sweden&#x27;s greatest and most prolific football players; a statue has been erected in his honor outside Gamla Ullevi stadium.

==Early years==
Gren was born on 31 October 1920 to parents Johan Olsson and Gerda Maria Olsson. Gren, a son of a carpenter, grew up in Majorna, Gothenburg. From a young age, Gren excelled in football. On 7 October 1934, Gothenburg Football Association President Carl &#x27;Ceve&#x27; Linde held a juggling contest. He won his first sporting prize – a bronze plaque. &quot;Göteborgs Sport Bladet&quot; wrote about 13-year-old Gren&#x27;s skills and how he outshone some of the big boys in the national league. The then-13-year-old Gren played for Strix. During his youth, he played for Lindholmens and GAIK, before playing for Gårda.

==Club career==

===Gårda===
In 1937, Gren started playing for Gårda BK. He made his Allsvenskan debut on 1 May 1938 against Malmö FF, which resulted in a scoreless draw. During his time there, he played a total of 54 matches, scoring 16 goals.

===IFK Göteborg===
In 1941, he was recruited by IFK Gothenburg. During his time in the club, Gren won one national championships in the 1941/42 season and was top scorer in 1947. He won the first ever Guldbollen in 1946.
His first league match for IFK was in August 1941, when Gothenburg played against Gårda, winning 6–1 with Gren scoring the first goal. His last league game for Gothenburg was on 6 June 1949 versus Norrköping at Gamla Ullevi in which Gothenburg lost 1–0. He had played 164 matches for Gothenburg and scored 78 goals.

===AC Milan===
On 11 September 1949, he debuted for A.C. Milan against Sampdoria, with Milan winning 3–1. During his time with Milan, he became the &#x27;Gre&#x27; part of the famous Gre-No-Li trio with his Swedish teammates Gunnar Nordahl (&#x27;No&#x27;) and Nils Liedholm (&#x27;Li&#x27;). He also earned the nickname the &quot;Il Professore&quot; which is Italian for &quot;the professor&quot;. While at A.C. Milan, he won the league title for the 1950–51 season. He made 133 appearances in Serie A and scored 38 goals. Gren also managed Milan in 1952, before moving to Fiorentina.

===Later career===
In 1953, Gren moved to Fiorentina, where he made 55 appearances and scored five goals. Then in 1955, Gren moved to Genoa where he made 29 appearances and two goals. Tired of Italy, Gren decided to move back to Sweden. In 1956, Gren returned to Gothenburg, where he joined Örgryte as both player and manager. Gren left in 1959 and played for GAIS in 1963.

==International career==

Gren made his debut for Sweden on 29 August 1940 in the team&#x27;s 3–2 win over Finland. During the next decade he played 40 matches for the national team, ending in 1949 with 3–1 against Ireland in a World Cup qualifier and 2–2 in a friendly against Hungary. During this era Gren was part of the team that won the gold medal in the 1948 Olympics in London, scoring twice against Yugoslavia in the final on Wembley.

As a professional, Gren was suspended from the Sweden men&#x27;s national team. However, the World Cup of 1958 would be in play on home soil and the Sweden national team seemed too weak for the competition, the Swedish Football Association changed this rule, and Gren, having now ended his professional career and playing in the Swedish Division 2, was again eligible. Gren went on to be the second oldest player of this World Cup, 37 years old, and played an important role in the silver medal-winning Swedish team. He played five matches during the World Cup and scored one goal, 2–1 against West Germany in the semi-final.
He was also named on the 1958 World Cup All-Star Team.

Gren&#x27;s last cap came on 26 October 1958 against Denmark in a 4–4 draw. At the time, he was 37 years, 360 days old. In all, Gren made 57 appearances for the national team, scoring 32 goals.

==Managerial career==
Whilst at A.C. Milan, Gren managed the team in 1952. Also, Gren managed both Örgryte and GAIS as player-manager. After retiring as a player, Gren managed several teams. Gren became the technical director for Juventus for a brief period in 1961. Gren then managed GAIS, Värnamo, Redbergslid, Skogens, Oddevold and Fässberg.

==Retirement==
Gren retired from football in the 1970s. He died ten days after his 71st birthday, and is buried in Västra Kyrkogården (Western Cemetery), Gothenburg, Västra Götaland, Sweden.

<text>The Erdre (; ) is a long river in western France, right tributary to the Loire. Its source is in the Maine-et-Loire &quot;department&quot;, near La Pouëze. It flows through the &quot;departments&quot; Maine-et-Loire and Loire-Atlantique. The Erdre meets the Loire in the city of Nantes. Other towns on the Erdre, going downstream, are Candé, Riaillé, Nort-sur-Erdre and Sucé-sur-Erdre.

South of Nort-sur-Erdre, the river flows through reclaimed marshland, and is up to a kilometer wide at the Plaine de Mazerolles near Sucé-sur-Erdre. At the Plaine de la Poupiniere, the Nantes-Brest canal joins the Erdre.

The Erdre flows into the Loire via the under , emerging near the main railway station. Its former course is a main road and shopping area, the .

<doc id="1114837" wikidata="Q917460" url="?curid=1114837" title="Gilles Kepel">
<text>Gilles Kepel, (born June 30, 1955) is a French political scientist and Arabist, specialized in the contemporary Middle East and Muslims in the West. He was Professor at Sciences Po Paris, the Université Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) and director of the Middle East and Mediterranean Program at PSL, based at Ecole Normale Supérieure. His latest English-translated book is, &quot;Away from Chaos&quot;. &quot;The Middle East and the Challenge to the West (&quot;Columbia University Press, 2020) was reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;an excellent primer for anyone wanting to get up to speed on the region”. His last essay, &quot;le Prophète et la Pandémie / du Moyen-Orient au jihadisme d&#x27;atmosphère&quot;, just released in French (February 2021), has topped the best-seller lists and is currently being translated into English and a half-dozen languages.

==Biography==
Originally trained as a classicist, he started to study Arabic after a journey to the Levant in 1974. He first graduated in Philosophy and English, then completed his Arabic language studies at the French Institute in Damascus (1977–78), and received his degree in political science from Sciences Po in Paris in 1980. He specialized in contemporary Islamist movements, and spent three years at the Centre d&#x27;études et de documentation économiques, juridiques et sociales (CEDEJ) where he did the fieldwork for his PhD (defended in 1983) on “Islamist movements in Egypt”, which would be translated and published in the UK in 1985 in English as &quot;The Prophet and Pharaoh&quot; (US title: &quot;Muslim Extremism in Egypt&quot;, 1986). This was the first book in any language to analyze contemporary Islamist militants, and it often is featured on reading lists to this day in universities worldwide.

After his return to France, where he became a researcher at CNRS (France National Research Faculty) he investigated the developments of Islam as a social and political phenomenon there, which led to his Banlieues de l’Islam (not translated) book (1987), a primer on studies of Islam in the West. He then turned to the compared study of political-religious movements in Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and published in 1991 &quot;The Revenge of God&quot;, a best-selling book which was translated into 19 languages.

As a visiting professor at New York University in 1993, he also did fieldwork among black Muslims in the U.S., which would be compared with phenomena pertaining to the Rushdie affair in the UK and the Hijab affairs in France, and lead to his Allah in the West (1996).

He received his &quot;habilitation à diriger des recherches&quot; (habilitation to be a PhD supervisor) in 1993 – from a committee presided by René Rémond, president of Sciences Po, and including Ernest Gellner, Rémy Leveau, Alain Touraine, and André Miquel. He was promoted to research director at CNRS in 1995, and spent academic year 1995–1996 in the US as New York Consortium Professor (a joint position at Columbia and New York Universities and the New School for Social Research). He used the library facilities at NYU and Columbia to explore the scholarly sources for his best-selling book &quot;&quot; based on two years of fieldwork in the Muslim World from Indonesia to Africa, which came out in English in 2001, and was translated into a dozen languages. Though the book was hailed due to its scope and perspective, it was criticized after 9/11 because it documented the failure of political Islamist mobilization in the late 1990s. Kepel answered his critics with his travelogue Bad Moon Rising in 2002. He then analyzed in retrospect that failure as the end of a first phase of what he would later designate as the “dialectics of Jihadism”. It epitomized the struggle against the “nearby enemy”, followed by a second phase (Al Qaeda) that learned the lessons of such failure and focused on the “faraway enemy”, which in turn failed to mobilize Muslim masses under the banner of Jihadists. It was ultimately followed by a third phase consisting of network-based Jihadi cells in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, that of ISIS. That Jihad trilogy was further developed in &quot;The War for Muslim Minds&quot; (2006) and Beyond Terror and Martyrdom (2008). With his students, Kepel also co-edited &quot;Al Qaeda in its Own Words&quot; (2006) – a translation and analysis of chosen texts by Jihadi ideologues Abdallah Azzam, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

In 2001, he was appointed as a tenured professor of political science at Sciences Po, where he created the Middle East and Mediterranean Program, and the EuroGolfe Forum. He supervised more than 40 PhD dissertations, and created the “Proche Orient” series, of which he was the general editor, at Presses Universitaires de France, for his PhD graduates to publish their first book after their dissertation. The series comprised 23 volumes from 2004 to 2017 – many of them finding their way into English translations.

In 2008, accused of assaulting Pascal Menoret at the Middle East Studies Association in Washington, after the latter had circulated online slanderous material, Gilles Kepel was expelled from the association.

In December 2010, the month of Mohammad Bouazizi&#x27;s self immolation at Sidi Bouzid, in Tunisia, that sparked the Arab Spring, Sciences Po closed the Middle East and Mediterranean Program. Kepel was elected a senior fellow at Institut Universitaire de France for five years (2010–2015), which allowed him to refocus on fieldwork. He was also offered the visiting “Philippe Roman Professorship in History and International Relations” at the London School of Economics” in 2009–2010.

In 2012, he published Banlieue de la République, a survey of the 2005 French Banlieues riots in the Clichy-Montfermeil area, north of Paris, whence the events sparked. The study was based on one-year participant observation on the premises with a team of students, in cooperation with Institut Montaigne think-tank. A sequel, Quatre-vingt treize (or “93” from the postal code of the Seine Saint Denis district north of Paris) designed a more general perspective on Islam in France, 25 years after Kepel&#x27;s seminal Les banlieues de l’Islam.

In 2013, he documented the Arab upheavals with the travelogue &quot;Passion Arabe&quot;, a best-selling book that was awarded the “Pétrarque Prize” by France Culture radio and &quot;Le Monde&quot; daily as best book of the year.

In 2014, Passion Française, a survey cum travelogue that documented the first generation of candidates to the Parliamentary elections of June 2012 who were from Muslim descent, and focused on Marseille and Roubaix, was the third book in a tetralogy that would culminate with &quot;Terror in France: The Rise of Jihad in the West&quot; (Princeton UP, 2017; original French 2015) that dealt with the terror attacks by Jihadists in France and put them in perspective.

In 2016, La Fracture, based on radio chronicles on France Culture in 2015–16, analyzed the impact of Jihadi terror in the wake of attacks on French and European soil. It puts them in perspective with the rise of extreme-right parties in Europe and questions the very fracture of politics in the Old Continent.

Kepel serves on several advisory boards such as the High Council of the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris and, since 2016, Kepel is a member of the advisory board of the Berlin-based Middle East think tank Candid Foundation.

In February 2016 he was appointed chairman of the newly founded Program of Excellence on the Mediterranean and the Middle East at Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) University, based at Ecole Normale Supérieure. He is in charge of the monthly seminar on “Violence and Dogma: Territories and representations of contemporary Islam”.

In 2017, Kepel was one of the seven public figures mentioned by , the jihadi terrorist who murdered a policeman and his wife in front of their son in 2016 Magnanville terrorist attack.

Since January 2018, Gilles Kepel is professor at the Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres University.

He is also director of the Middle Eastern Mediterranean Freethinking Platform at the Università della Svizzera italiana in Lugano, Switzerland where, since September 2018, he is an adjunct professor. The MEM Summer Summit is held every August, gathering young change-makers from the Middle East Mediterranean region.

In October 2018, he published &quot;Sortir du Chaos, Les crises en Méditerranée et au Moyen Orient.&quot; The book was translated into English by Henry Randolph and published in the US in 2020 by Columbia University Press as : &quot;Away from Chaos. The Middle East and the Challenge to the West&quot;. It is a sweeping political history of four decades of Middle East conflict and its worldwide ramifications. In the months following the publication, Gilles Kepel participated in webinars organized on both sides of the Atlantic and the English Channel, such as the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Al Monitor, the Center on National Security at Fordham University, Cambridge University... &quot;The New York Times&quot; recommended the book in its 12 new books weekly selection.

His 2021 essay, &quot;The Prophet and the Pandemic / From the Middle East to Atmospheric Jihadism&quot;, released in French in February 2021, topped best-seller lists and is currently being translated into English and a half-dozen languages. An excerpt, &quot;The Murder of Samuel Paty&quot;, was printed in the Issue#3 of &quot;Liberties Journal&quot; (April 27, 2021). In 2024, Plon published Kepel&#x27;s &quot;Holocaustes: Israël, Gaza et la guerre contre l&#x27;Occident&quot;.

==Ideas and analyses==
According to Kepel, jihadi terrorism is caused by &quot;the entrenchment of Salafism&quot;, a fundamentalist ideology in which most radical elements clash with the values of Western democracies and &quot;are aiming for the destruction of Europe through civil war&quot;.

In 2017, Kepel criticized Olivier Roy&#x27;s assertion that jihadi terrorism is only loosely connected to Islamic fundamentalism as Roy neither speaks Arabic nor looks into the Salafi doctrine behind the jihadism. Kepel also referred to London as &quot;Londonistan&quot;: &quot;[the United Kingdom] gave shelter to radical Islamist leaders from around the world as a sort of insurance policy against jihadi terrorism. But you know, when you go for dinner with the devil...&quot;. Roy has said &quot;I have been accused of disregarding the link between terrorist violence and the religious radicalisation of Islam through Salafism, the ultra-conservative interpretation of the faith. I am fully aware of all of these dimensions; I am simply saying that they are inadequate to account for the phenomena we study, because no causal link can be found on the basis of the empirical data we have available.&quot; This debate can be summarized as opposition between Kepel&#x27;s theory of &quot;radicalisation of Islam&quot; and Roy&#x27;s one of &quot;Islamicisation of radicalism&quot;.

According to Kepel, prominent figures and leaders among the left-leaning ideologists do not understand the threats against France, which according to him encompasses both terrorists arriving from abroad and Islamists in the French ghettos (French: &quot;banlieues&quot;). According to Kepel, Islamists are eroding societal cohesion in order to start a civil war while being unwittingly supported by the many leftists. This position makes him a target in many circles.

Kepel claims he belongs to the left in France and according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; he has &quot;always been careful to distinguish mainstream Islam from the hard-line Islamist ideologues&quot; and has &quot;no sympathy for the xenophobia of the right-wing National Front&quot;. He has &quot;repeatedly dismissed claims of widespread Islamophobia in French society as fraudulent, saying the word has become little more than a rhetorical club used by Islamists to rally their base&quot;.

<doc id="1114845" wikidata="Q280650" url="?curid=1114845" title="Mayenne (river)">
<text>The Mayenne () is a long river in western France, principally located in the French region of Pays de la Loire. Together with the river Sarthe and its tributary the Loir it forms the Maine, which is a tributary to the Loire.

==Geography==

Its source is in the department of Orne near the commune of Lalacelle, between Pré-en-Pail and Alençon. The source is in the foothills of Mont des Avaloirs at an altitude of 961 feet (293m); from there the river runs from east to west until it reaches Sept-Forges, at which point it turns to the south. After being joined by the Oudon, the Mayenne forms a confluence with the Sarthe north of Angers. The confluence of these two rivers is called the Maine, which is the local pronunciation of Mayenne. The waters of the Maine then empty into the Loire south of Angers.

Departments and towns along the river include:
* Orne
* Mayenne: Mayenne, Laval, Château-Gontier
* Maine-et-Loire: Chenillé-Changé, Chambellay, Montreuil-sur-Maine, Le Lion-d&#x27;Angers, Grez-Neuville, Pruillé, La Membrolle-sur-Longuenée, Feneu, Montreuil-Juigné, Cantenay-Epinard, Angers.

It is featured prominently in the video game &quot;Call of Duty 3&quot;.

==Navigation==

The Mayenne was navigable in its natural state up to Château-Gontier. Works were undertaken in the 16th century to make the river navigable upstream from here to Laval; royal decrees by François I in 1536 and 1537 authorised the necessary works, including flash locks. Economic expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries justified engineering with locks and weirs not only to Laval but also upstream to Mayenne. This extension, with 20 locks and weirs, was built at the same time as about 40 flash locks were replaced by 25 weirs and locks, some in short lock-cuts, between 1853 et 1878. The river was used by barges carrying up to 130 tonnes, and the principal traffics were construction materials (wood and stone), coal from the mines of L&#x27;Huisserie, grain, fruit and vegetables. At this time it was planned to build a watershed canal north from Mayenne to the tidal river Orne at Caen, but the project was abandoned as railways became the preferred carrier of freight. The navigation was abandoned after World War II, but restored from the 1970s as a cruising waterway. The upstream section was completed in the early 1990s.

==Flow==

In spite of abundant precipitation, the flow of the Mayenne is irregular because of the impermeability of the sandstone, granite, and schist which form its drainage basin. Thus, for an average flow of before the Mayenne&#x27;s confluence with the Oudon, the yearly minimum flow can range from very low ( at Laval) to very high (flash floods with flows of at Laval and more than at Chambellay).

The flow of the Mayenne has been observed for a period of 44 years (1965–2008) at Chambellay, situated upstream of the confluence with the Sarthe, and just upstream from where the Oudon joins the Mayenne. At this location, the drainage basin of the river is out of a total of , which is less than three-quarters of the entire drainage basin (71.5%), and also does not include the flow of the Oudon, the Mayenne&#x27;s principal tributary.

The average yearly flow at Chambellay is , which corresponds to over if the rest of the drainage basin were included.

=== Tributaries ===
The main tributaries of the Mayenne are, from source to mouth:
* Varenne
* Colmont
* Ernée
* Jouanne
* Vicoin
* Oudon
* Ouette

<text>In the history of cryptography, the NEMA (NEue MAschine) (&quot;new machine&quot;), also designated the T-D (Tasten-Druecker-Maschine) (&quot;key-stroke machine&quot;), was a 10-wheel rotor machine designed by the Swiss Army during the World War II as a replacement for their Enigma machines.

==History==
The Swiss became aware that their current machine, a commercial Enigma (the Swiss K), had been broken by both Allied and German cryptanalysts.

A new design was begun between 1941 and 1943 by Captain Arthur Alder, a professor of mathematics at the University of Bern. The team which designed the machine also included Professors Hugo Hadwiger and Heinrich Emil Weber.

In the spring of 1944, the first prototype had become available. After some modifications, the design was accepted in March 1945, and production of 640 machines began the following month by Zellweger AG. The first machine entered service in 1947.

NEMA was declassified on 9 July 1992, and machines were offered for sale to the public on 4 May 1994.

==The machine==
NEMA uses 10 wheels, of which four are normal electrical rotors with 26 contacts at each end that are scramble wired in a way unique to each rotor type; one is an electrical reflector (like the Enigma&#x27;s &quot;Umkehrwalze&quot;) with one set of 26 pairwise cross connected contacts; and the remaining five are &quot;drive wheels&quot;, with mechanical cams that control the stepping of the rotors and the reflector. The wheels are assembled on an axle in pairs consisting of a drive wheel and an electrical rotor.


The NEMA machine weighs about 10 kg and measures approximately 36×32×14 cm.

<text>Full Thrust is a science fiction strategy wargame written by Jon Tuffley and published by Ground Zero Games of England. It is usually played with miniature figurines representing imaginary starships, although cardboard chits representing the vessels can also be used. Unlike many games, the publishers encourage the use of any miniatures rather than only &quot;official&quot; ones, though Ground Zero Games does also sell an extensive miniature range.

&quot;Full Thrust&quot; is one of the most popular games representing starship battles. The game has its own military science fiction/space opera universe. However, the rulebook states that this background is entirely optional; the game is intentionally designed to allow players a high degree of creativity within the rule set. There are also many unofficial conversions to other sci-fi universes like &quot;Star Trek&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Full Trek&quot;), &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Honor Harrington&quot;.

==History==

The most current &quot;Full Thrust&quot; rules set is generally known as &quot;version 2.5&quot;, though this is not the title of any official release; it refers to the rules from &quot;Full Thrust, Second Edition&quot; (1992) as extensively amended by the two &quot;Fleet Book&quot; volumes (published in 1998 and 2000). &quot;Version 2.5&quot; is often played with some rules from &quot;More Thrust&quot;, the most common being fighter morale. The plain &quot;Second Edition&quot; rules set is known as &quot;version 2&quot;, and itself incorporated several changes from the previous, now out of print, First Edition published in 1991.

A Version 3.0 is planned for some time in the future, but no date has been set. However, the Second Edition and the Fleet Books are all available as free downloads in PDF form on the Ground Zero Games online store.

==Plot and universe==

Although the authors of the game stated that their universe is of second importance to the rules, nonetheless the universe as developed in the rulebooks has been adopted and expanded by many fans.

The official universe is an example of a military space opera with numerous stellar factions fighting for control of the known space. The main political entities include four major human powers, dozens of smaller human powers and three alien races. The game is set around the year 2188.

Major human empires:

*NAC — The &quot;New Anglian Confederation&quot; was formed in 2057. The NAC colonies fall under a constitutional monarchy. Their Royal Space Navy descended from the British Royal Navy, and is an amalgam of former British, Canadian and United States forces. Their official language is English and their capital is on the planet Albion. Their symbol is a stylized &quot;A&quot; shape with three bars of red, white and blue in the center.
*NSL — The &quot;Neu Swabian League&quot; was formed in 2101 after the split of the European Space Force. Their official language is German and their navy is known as the Kriegsraumflotte. Their capital is located on the planet Neu Salzburg. Their symbol is a stylized black eagle with spread wings on a field of red.
*FSE — The &quot;Federal Stats Europa&quot; (aka &quot;Federated States of Europe&quot;) was formed in 2101 after the split of the European Space Force. Their colonies fall under a democratic council core government. Their official language is French and their space navy is known as L&#x27;Astromarine des FSE. Their symbol is stylized gold bull&#x27;s head with a gold star between the horns upon a field of blue.
*ESU — The &quot;Eurasian Solar Union&quot; was formed in 2079. Their colonies fall under a primarily communist republic government made up of an amalgam of former Russian and Chinese societies. Their naval fleet, literally Military Space Fleet is known as Voyenno-Kosmicheskiy Flot in Russian and Taikong Jiann Dwee in Chinese. Their capital world is Nova Moskva. Their symbol is a red star with a gold edge on a red field.
*IJSN — The &quot;Imperial Japanese Star Navy&quot; was formed in 2108 with the threat of war from the ESU and the need to expand territory in search for resources. Their official language is Japanese and their writing is the Kanji script. Their naval command structure has fallen from the long-standing corporate structure back to the military doctrine. The capital world is Nihhon Prime. Their symbol of a rising red sun with red sun beams over a white background.

Minor human powers — There are also many smaller powers, such as Free Cal-Tex, the Pan-African Union, the League of Latin American Republics, etc. Other human powers also include various mercenary units allied to the highest bidder and numerous smuggling and pirate gangs operating within and outside the territories.

Alien species:

*Kra&#x27;Vak — The Kra&#x27;Vak, (their name translated as &quot;People of the Sorrow Killer&quot;), are clan-based bipedal anthropoids with a mix of reptilian and insectoid features. They communicate with a guttural language that is hard for humans to comprehend thus making relations with them very difficult. Relations are complicated further by the fact that Kra&#x27;vak pass through several gender and behavioral stages as they age which make them somewhat unpredictable as members of one stage are more aggressive and territorial than those in another stage. Kra&#x27;vak technology is similar to humans, but in some cases they are not as advanced. They favor powerful non-energy based weaponry such as railguns and missiles, and they also lack shield technology.
*Sa&#x27;Vasku — The Sa&#x27;Vasku are extremely long-lived semi-aquatic lifeforms resembling giant nearly-immobile jellyfish. They are an ancient race that has seen many space-faring species rise and fall. Little is known of their race except for the fact that they seem obsessed with balance and are fearful of change. They believe young space-faring races like humans are too naive to be left unchecked and they ruthlessly oppose their expansion into space. Sa&#x27;Vasku technology is biosynthetic and their spaceships are alive, genetically created and grown for specific purposes. Their construct ships are equipped with various &quot;weapon organs&quot; that generate energy beams or launch spore projectiles.
*Phalon — The Phalons are a carbon-based, oxygen-breathing species, somewhat humanoid in physique however they have multi-jointed limbs, exoskeletal hides and flat triangular-shaped heads dominated by single tri-lensed eye. They have three sexes, fertile males and females, and a more numerous asexual group that comprises most of their military force. Like the Sa&#x27;Vasku, Phalon technology is bio-synthetic in nature however they use genetically grown materials like humans use metal and plastic, building snail-like spaceships that are made from organic components but are not &quot;alive&quot; in their own right. The Phalon thinking-process is similar to humans, and the two species can carry on meaningful conversations, however Phalons are completely amoral. They take what they want without considering payment, and do what they wish without any regard to consequence.

==Overview of game mechanics==
&quot;Full Thrust&quot; (&quot;FT&quot;) uses six-sided dice, or d6, for all combat resolutions. Typically, a game of &quot;FT&quot; requires many six-sided dice. In the version 2.5 rule set, measurements in &quot;FT&quot; are based on Movement Units (MU), which can be equal to whatever measurements the players wish to use. Usually they are either inches or centimeters, but this depends on the sizes of the models used and the size of the battle board. Normally, rulers or tape measures are used to measure distances between models, as in most traditional figure-based wargames; &quot;FT&quot; can also be played on a hex-printed battle board where each 1 inch hex represents one MU, but the rules do not explicitly support this.

&quot;FT&quot; is a turn-based game: each player secretly writes down their movement orders, then all players move their ships simultaneously or one after another, in accordance with those orders. Combat is played in several phases (missile movement, fighter attacks, direct-fire weapons, etc.). A game may be played until one side is wiped out, or for a set number of turns, but most commonly an explicit objective is set for each side, with victory determined both by this and by the remaining forces at the end of the game, or when one side has taken heavy damage and the player decides to retract their fleet from the game play.

===Point values===

For a pick-up game rather than part of a more extended campaign, players build fleets of warships based on point values. Opposing forces decide how many points they will be using before play; larger and more powerful ships cost more points, so this is a reasonable guide to the length and complexity of a battle.

===Mass factors===

Each ship has a Mass Factor which represents the size of its hull; all systems (weapons, drives, defences, etc.) must fit inside this. As the ship gets larger, its classification could change. The smallest ships are usually Scouts, Frigates, and Corvettes (9 - 28 mass); medium mass ships are Destroyers and Cruisers (30 - 90 mass); and the heaviest ships are Battleships, Dreadnoughts, and Carriers (up to about 270 mass). The game is capable of handling &quot;Superships&quot; which have Mass Factors over 300. Adding weapons and systems costs points as well as mass.

===Thrust rating===

All ships need sublight engines with a Thrust Rating. This number represents how many Movement Units (MU) on the battle map a ship can change its speed per turn. Speed is incremental, so for instance a ship with a Thrust Factor of 3 can increase its speed up +3 MUs per turn: from a speed of 3 one turn, to 6 the next, then to 9 the next, and so on. It can also slow down its thrust rating per turn as well. If it were at speed 9, it would take it 3 turns to slow to a dead stop.

Two movement systems are available: the default &quot;cinematic&quot; system, in which ships move and turn in the style of wet navy vessels as seen in space opera film and television, and the &quot;vector&quot; system which is a rather more realistic representation of movement in space but is somewhat more complex.

All movement of ships is planned ahead of time, before the miniatures are physically moved. These movements are written down on a Movement Orders sheet and kept secret from other players until the turn begins. Players must move their ships as they have written them down on their orders sheet. Movement orders must also include the launching of any missiles and fighters.

===FTL===

Most ships also have FTL (faster-than-light) drives; the only ones that aren&#x27;t in-system defence ships, orbital stations, or &quot;battle riders&quot; brought into combat via an FTL tug.

The FTL is normally used not for tactical but for strategic purposes, allowing a damaged ship or an outnumbered fleet to flee from battle and preserve its remaining strength. Due to the physical nature of the FTL system, it can (in desperation), be used as a weapon itself although it has as much a chance of destroying the ship that deploys it as it does an enemy vessel.

Variant settings, such as the one based in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe (&quot;Full Trek&quot;), may have different technology rules. In &quot;Full Trek&quot;, the nature of the Warp drive allows ship-to-ship combat while in warp.

===Weapons===

There are several weapon systems available in the &quot;Full Thrust&quot; game:

Beam weapons

The most common ship weapons are Beam Batteries which have a power level such as 1, 2, 3 (or higher). The larger the number, the farther the battery can fire, and the more damage dice the weapon inflicts.

For every power level of the battery, the beams can fire out 12 Movement Units (MUs) from the ship on the table. A Level 1 battery can fire at a maximum range of 12MU. A Level 2 can fire a maximum of 24MU, and so on. For every 12MU the beam fires, it loses 1 die of damaging power. For instance: A Level 2 battery inflicts 2 dice of damage within 12MU, and only 1 die of damage after that.

Under the Second Edition (Ver. 2.0) of the &quot;FT&quot; rules, batteries had a letter designation, with Class C batteries being equivalent to Level 1 batteries. Class A was the most powerful until Mega AA batteries were added. Mega AAs could fire the farthest, but had a chance of burning out. In Ver. 2.5 the beam weapon system was refined, and the former class A became class 3, the former class B became class 2 and so on.

In theory, there is now no limit to how powerful a beam weapon can be; for instance, a massive super ship could have a beam weapon of class 10 (or higher), although such an application would be impractical due to the increases of mass and point cost. The ship would have a better chance of inflicting more damage with several smaller weapons instead of one super weapon.

Other systems

Other kinds of offensive weapons include Pulse Torpedoes, Needle Beams (which can target a specific system on an enemy ship and disable it), Submunition Packs, Missiles, Minelayers and &quot;mega-damage&quot; weapons, such as the Nova Cannon and Wave Gun.

Ships can be protected by Point-Defense Systems (PDSs), which are clusters of smaller weapons used to shoot down missiles and enemy fighters. There are also Screen systems to use against beam attacks, though not all weapons are impeded by them; missiles and mass driver projectiles can pass through to the hull, which are why PDSs can be an asset. Some other miscellaneous systems include Reflex Fields (which have a chance of deflecting a beam back at an attacker), Cloaking Fields, and Enhanced Sensors.

Ships are required to include Fire Control sensors in their designs. Without firecons a ship cannot select targets; the more firecons incorporated into the design, the more targets the ship can fire at per turn. A specialised firecon, the Area Defence Fire Control, allows a ship&#x27;s PDS to attack missiles and fighters aimed at other targets, in the manner of an Aegis ship.

&quot;Fleet Book Vol. 2: The Xeno Files&quot; added even more weapons including mass drivers, strange alien weapons, and living ships hulls.

===Fighters===

If players include carriers in their fleets, they may dispatch groups of fighters into battle. There are many kinds of specialized fighter for different tactical attacks. Interceptors, for instance, have better chances of destroying enemy fighters but have no anti-ship strike ability, while Torpedo Fighters have a heavy one-shot anti-ship punch but are vulnerable to other fighters.

<text>The Sarthe () is a river in western France. Together with the river Mayenne it forms the river Maine, which is a tributary to the river Loire.

Its source is in the Orne department, near Moulins-la-Marche. It flows generally southwest, through the following departments and towns:

*Orne: Le Mêle-sur-Sarthe, Alençon 
*Sarthe: Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, Beaumont-sur-Sarthe, Le Mans, Sablé-sur-Sarthe 
*Maine-et-Loire: Châteauneuf-sur-Sarthe, Tiercé, Angers

Its main tributaries are the Loir and the Huisne from the left, and the Vaige, the Erve and the Vègre from the right.


== Navigation ==
The Sarthe has 20 weirs and locks. The channel is well marked and navigation is straightforward, except for the risk of shoals in certain sections.

<doc id="1114855" wikidata="Q5098428" url="?curid=1114855" title="Children of Eden">
<text>Children of Eden is a 1991 musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by John Caird. The musical is based on the Book of Genesis, with Act I telling the story of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, while Act II deals with Noah and the flood.

Though commercially the musical has had very little success, it is popular in community and regional theatres worldwide, due to its ability to accommodate a large or small cast, religious subject, and its universal themes of family and love. The show&#x27;s publisher, Music Theatre International, reports that &quot;Children of Eden&quot; is one of its top 20 most frequently licensed properties.

==Production history==

===Origins===
&quot;Children of Eden&quot; was originally written in 1986 as &quot;Family Tree&quot; for a production by Youth Sing Praise, a religious-oriented high school theatre camp performed at the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows in Belleville, Illinois. Stephen Schwartz adapted the script and music of &quot;Family Tree&quot; into a full-length musical, giving it the title it uses today.

===Original London Production===
The original cast production of &quot;Children of Eden&quot; was developed as a Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) workshop. The production was directed by John Caird, and starred Ken Page as Father, Richard Lloyd-King as the Snake, Martin Smith as Adam, Shezwae Powell as Eve, Adrian Beaumont as Cain, Kevin Colson as Noah, Earlene Bentley as Mama Noah, Frances Ruffelle as Yonah, Anthony Barclay as Japheth, Craig Pinder as Shem, Ray Shell as Ham, Hiromi Itoh as Aysha and Ruthie Henshall as Aphra. After the RSC&#x27;s budget was cut, it instead opened at the Prince Edward Theatre in London&#x27;s West End on January 8, 1991. The show closed on April 6, 1991, due to poor reviews and the negative effects the Persian Gulf War had on tourism worldwide.

Because of the show&#x27;s poor reviews and quick closing, the idea of a Broadway transfer was abandoned. Schwartz believes the show has not played on Broadway because of the expense required to produce it in an Actor&#x27;s Equity house, due to the cast of characters.

===American Premiere===
Throughout the 1990s, the show received numerous productions at both the amateur and professional levels; it was also reworked and edited, with songs and scenes being added and cut. In 1997, a major production was mounted at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey. The production ran from November 5 to December 14, 1997. In contrast to the London production, the Paper Mill production had actors double roles. A cast recording of this production was produced by Schwartz himself. This revised version, commonly known as the &quot;American version&quot; or &quot;Paper Mill version&quot;, is substantially what is currently licensed for production in the United States.

The cast featured William Solo as Father, Adrian Zmed as Adam/Noah, Stephanie Mills as Eve/Mama Noah, Darius de Haas as Cain/Japheth, Hunter Foster as Abel/Ham, and Kelli Rabke as Yonah.

===Subsequent Productions===

The New York City premiere of the piece was as the inaugural World AIDS Day Concert presented by Jamie McGonnigal and Kate Shindle for The York Theatre Company. The concert featured Norm Lewis as Father, Julia Murney as Eve/Mama Noah, Jonathan Dokuchitz as Adam/Noah, Darius de Haas as Cain/Japheth, Max von Essen as Abel/Ham, Kate Shindle as Yonah, John Tartaglia as Seth/Shem, Ann Harada as Aysha, and Laura Benanti as the Snake. The concert raised funds for The National AIDS Fund and was presented December 1, 2003, at Riverside Church.

A Gala charity concert adaptation ran for one night only at the Prince of Wales theatre in London on 29 January 2012. The concert was produced to support Crohn&#x27;s and Colitis UK and featured performers from London&#x27;s West End theatre community and from UK television.

In 2013 &quot;Children of Eden&quot; was presented in Melbourne, Australia by award-winning production company Magnormos, as the finale of their Stephen Schwartz Celebration Triptych, which also featured Godspell and Pippin. Composer Stephen Schwartz was in attendance.

A one-night only concert was presented at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., on May 19, 2014. The concert featured Ron Bohmer as Father, Charl Brown as Adam/Noah, Ashley Brown as Eve/Mama Noah, Jeremy Jordan as Cain/Japheth, and Rebecca Naomi Jones as Yonah. The production was accompanied by the Kennedy Center Opera House Orchestra and the National Broadway Chorus, and was attended by composer Stephen Schwartz.

In 2015, the show was adapted into a junior version by Lindsay Maron and was presented at the Summit Playhouse in Summit, NJ from July 24-August 2, with preview performances July 17–19. The production was directed and choreographed by Maron with musical direction and musical arrangements by Alex Ratner. The cast included 37 performers from all over the tristate area. Stephen Schwartz and executives from MTI attended the production and the junior version of the show is now available through MTI.

In 2016, &quot;Children of Eden&quot; marked its 30th anniversary. In celebration of this achievement, Youth Sing Praise, the same religious-oriented high school theatre camp that premiered it in 1986, performed the show at the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows in Belleville, Illinois, on June 25, 2016, to a crowd of over 1,000 people.

In 2016, 25 years after its original London production, &quot;Children of Eden&quot; was revived at the new Union Theatre in Southwark, London.

In 2019, Schwartz announced a planned Chicago production in 2020 and its possible filming. The production was later postponed indefinitely due to COVID-19 and had planned to open in Chicago&#x27;s Arcada Theatre in 2022. The production was set to feature Norm Lewis, Deborah Cox, David Phelps, America&#x27;s Got Talent alum Brian Justin Crum, and Kirstin Maldonado of Pentatonix. The production was later put on as a concert on October 15, 2022, at the Cadillac Palace Theatre. The cast featured Randal Keith as Father, David Phelps as Adam/Noah, Michelle Williams as Eve/Mama Noah, Sam Tsui as Cain/Japheth, Chris Graham as Abel/Ham, and Koryn Hawthorne as Yonah. The production will be streamed sometime in 2024 ahead of a Broadway-aimed production in Chicago.

In 2024, a concert version of the show was performed at Lincoln Center. It starred Norm Lewis as the Father, Auli’i Cravalho as Yonah, Nikki Renée Daniels as Eve/Mama Noah, and Lucas Pastrana as Abel/Ham. Paul Alexander Nolan and Jordan Fisher were originally set to star as Adam/Noah and Cain/Japeth respectively, but were replaced by David Phelps and Donald Webber Jr. Choirs from around the world were invited to perform, including the Blue Springs High School Choir from Blue Springs, Missouri. 

===Recordings===

The Original London Cast Recording was released on LP and CD, but quickly went out of print. The CD release was marred by manufacturing defects that caused most of the discs to &quot;bronze&quot;, and become unplayable. Consequently, a playable copy of the disc is highly prized by musical theatre collectors.

The rarest recording of the show is a concept recording released after changes were made following the 1991 London production. The tracks feature Stephen Schwartz himself playing the piano. The recording was made before the Paper Mill Playhouse production in an effort to review the rewrites and revisions. The album was made available only for a limited time on Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s website via RealAudio streaming. This recording is considered to be the rarest version of the show that exists. There are only a handful of copies of this recording in existence.

The Paper Mill Playhouse Cast was recorded in 1998. The recording was financed by Stephen Schwartz. It is the only professional recording of the show in its revised state.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

Much like the story in Book of Genesis, the universe is born out of darkness. Father, with the help of the Storytellers, brings the universe and life into existence, including Father&#x27;s new children, Adam and Eve (&quot;Let There Be&quot;). Eve finds herself drawn to the Tree of Knowledge, but Father tells her to stay away from &quot;that tree,&quot; though he provides no clear reason why (&quot;The Tree of Knowledge&quot;). Father attempts to distract the two with a game where they name all the animals in the garden (&quot;The Naming&quot;). With everything right in the newly created world, Father reflects on parenthood and Adam and Eve fall in love with one another (&quot;Grateful Children&quot;, &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;, and &quot;Perfect&quot;). Though her life is perfect, Eve still hungers for something more: knowledge, adventure, and to see what lies beyond the garden (&quot;The Spark of Creation&quot;). Eve meets a snake who tempts her with apples from the forbidden tree and the possibilities that would open up for her if she eats it. (&quot;In Pursuit of Excellence&quot;). She eats the fruit and is awakened to knowledge and possibility. (&quot;The End of a Perfect Day&quot; and &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;). Later that night, Eve attempts to trick Adam into eating the apple in several apple-related dishes, but stops him before eats. Eve admits to Adam that she ate of the Tree of Knowledge and the two hide from Father in the garden.

Father, after discovering Eve has eaten the apple, tells her that she must leave the garden as she is no longer innocent. But unlike in the Genesis tale, Adam is made to choose his fate: he can either stay with Father in Eden, or he can eat the fruit and be banished with Eve. Adam, deeply torn by the decision, decides that, even though it means he has to leave the garden he loves with all his heart, he must be with Eve (&quot;A World Without You&quot;). Adam and Eve are driven out of the garden by Father and into the wasteland of the outside world. As the years pass, they build a new life and have two children, Cain and Abel (&quot;The Expulsion&quot; and &quot;The Wasteland&quot;). The family hope that Father will one day bring them home to Eden, praying to him each day and offering sacrifices of their crops.

Adam and Eve, out of fear for their children&#x27;s safety, have set their glen as a boundary, preventing them from going beyond a nearby waterfall. As the children grow into adulthood, Eve sees the same fire she once had present in her son, Cain (&quot;The Spark of Creation (Reprise 1)&quot;). Cain, much like his mother, longs to see the world beyond the boundaries placed by his parents, while Abel remains devoted to their parents and the idea that Father will one day bring them back to the garden. Cain begs Abel to run away with him, claiming Father doesn&#x27;t care about them and that the boys should not be stuck with the consequences of their parents mistakes (&quot;Lost in the Wilderness&quot;). As Abel hesitantly agrees to leave, Father appears. Having never seen Father, the two are shocked. Father shows the two love and affection and promises them their very own wives. Assuming that he has arrived to take them all back to the garden, Abel goes to fetch their parents, but is stopped by Father. It quickly becomes clear that Father has no intention of seeing their parents or taking any of them back to Eden. Cain, further embittered, tells Father and Abel that he is going to leave the glen, finally free from the boundaries and predetermined fate his parents and Father have set for him (&quot;Lost in the Wilderness (Reprise)&quot;). Father tells Abel to keep their visit secret from his parents, but that he will return to them soon.

Adam and Eve, deeply worried for Cain&#x27;s safety, reminisce on the boy&#x27;s childhoods and find some comfort in the fact they have created a life and family for themselves outside of Eden (&quot;Close to Home&quot;) But this peacefulness is shattered when Cain returns from his journey. He tells the family that he has seemingly found evidence proving the existence of other humans: a ring of giant stones. Cain takes the family to see the stones in the wasteland. While Eve and Abel are just as excited as Cain, Adam, however, becomes distant, cold, and mean, telling the family to return home. After prodding from the Family, Adam admits that he had found the ring of stones many years earlier, and was frightened of the people he found there. He kept this a secret, even from Eve, out of fear of the potential consequences (&quot;A Ring of Stones&quot; and &quot;Clash of the Generations&quot;). Adam&#x27;s betrayal quickly leads to a family-wide fight, culminating with Cain threatening to leave forever, taking Abel with him and starting a new life. Torn between these choices, Abel, fighting through his heartbreak, decides to stay with his parents. Devastated, Cain begins to leave, but is forcibly stopped by Adam, who slaps him and sends him to the ground. Cain vows that he will kill Adam and the two begin to fight. When Abel intervenes, Cain throws him off and, in his rage, beats Abel to death with a stone (&quot;The Death of Abel&quot;). Cain, leaving the remaining members of his family, tells them that Adam is the one that should be dead. Father, in his anger, burns a mark into Cain&#x27;s face. Father also decrees that his descendants will bear this mark forever as punishment for the sin of their ancestor. Cain stumbles into the wasteland. (&quot;The Mark of Cain&quot;).

Many years after Abel&#x27;s death and Cain&#x27;s departure, Eve attempts to speak to Father one last time as she prepares herself for death. She details the lives they lead after the tragedy; the birth of another son, Seth, who has since had children of his own, Adam&#x27;s grief over the loss of both his sons, and Adam&#x27;s recent death. Surrounded by her many children and grandchildren, she prays that they may one day regain the garden that was lost. As she dies, Father greets her, allowing her into heaven (&quot;Children of Eden&quot;).

===Act II===

The storytellers reconvene and continue their story, following the lineage of both Seth and Cain, tracing the descendants all the way down to Noah and his family (&quot;Generations&quot;).

Father, after centuries of facing the race of Cain, has created a storm that will wipe them from the face of their Earth. He informs Noah of the impending doom, as Noah&#x27;s family remain the only who are untainted by Cain&#x27;s lineage, and commands him to build an ark for refuge. Noah begs Father to reconsider, but Father leaves him with the command and that the ark must be large enough for both his family and two of every animal (&quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;).

Noah and his wife, Mama Noah, have three sons, and the eldest two, Shem and Ham, have wives, but his youngest son, Japheth, is unhappy and refuses the wives Noah has tried to obtain for him. At family dinner, he announces the woman he has chosen. Secretly, he has fallen in love with and wishes to marry the servant-girl, Yonah, a descendant of the race of Cain. Japheth tells this to his surprised family (&quot;A Piece of Eight&quot;). However, Noah cannot allow Yonah on the ark, due to her being a part of the race of Cain. As Yonah leaves, embarrassed, and Japheth angrily chases after her, all of the animals, played by the Storytellers, come to the ark so that they can board and be saved from the flood (&quot;The Return of the Animals&quot; and &quot;Noah&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;). Later, Noah finds Yonah outside and explains that she cannot board the ark, though he wishes she could join them. She reckons with her plight, but knows she will continue to face her problems with an open heart and mind, as she always has before (&quot;Stranger to the Rain&quot;). Japheth finds Yonah and attempts to convince her to sneak on to the ark with him, telling her that he doesn&#x27;t care about the consequences it may bring, as long as he can be with her. They vow to spend whatever time they have left together and secretly board the ark (&quot;In Whatever Time We Have&quot;), just as Father unleashes his wrath on the earth and the race of Cain (&quot;The Flood&quot;).

The rain continues for forty days and forty nights, never ceasing, and tensions on the ark are high. With couples fighting, discussions on how to survive through these desperate conditions, including killing animals on the ark for food, and Noah&#x27;s discovery that Father no longer speaks to him, the group questions why Father hasn&#x27;t stopped the storm (&quot;What is He Waiting For?&quot;). Yonah, having stayed undiscovered, releases a dove to find dry land and save the residents of the ark (&quot;Sailor of the Skies&quot;). When the family discovers Yonah, they assume she is the reason why Father&#x27;s wrath continues. Shem and Ham attempt to throw her overboard to appease him, but Japheth intervenes. This quickly escalates into a fight, directly mirroring the one between Adam and Cain generations ago, with Noah slapping Japheth to the ground. This time, however, Yonah intervenes and steps in between father and son, preventing the same events from playing out. Noah, shocked by the selflessness of one of the race of Cain, becomes unsure as to what he must do now. He sends the family away and attempts to talk to Father. Mama Noah asks him if Father speaks to him anymore, and when Noah answers &quot;No&quot;, she advises him: &quot;You must be the father now;&quot; that Noah has to live without God telling him what to do (&quot;The Spark of Creation (Reprise 2)&quot;). Noah and Father both think of the difficulties they have faced in being fathers, but both ultimately come to terms with the fact that if you love something, you must let it go (&quot;The Hardest Part of Love&quot;).

Noah calls the family together once more, all of them desperate for guidance and hope (&quot;Words of Doom&quot;). He decides to give Japheth and Yonah his blessing, allowing her to stay on the ark. The family huddles together to spend the time they have left as a happy, loving family (&quot;The Hour of Darkness&quot;). They spot the dove Yonah released, now returning with an olive branch in its beak, signifying nearby land, and the family finally sees the light of the stars return to the sky. The family rejoices (&quot;Ain&#x27;t It Good?&quot;). Father decides to give humanity the power to control its fate and offers his blessing for all to find their future without his direct influence (&quot;Precious Children&quot;). The family lands and leaves the ark. They make plans to separate, taking various animals to their new homes across the world. As they say their final goodbyes, the family addresses the problems they know the future holds, but vow to face them with love and open eyes. They set off, still with hope that one day they will return home; to Eden (&quot;In the Beginning&quot;).

<text>Joel Steven Siegel (July 7, 1943 – June 29, 2007) was an American film critic for the ABC morning news show &quot;Good Morning America&quot; for over 25 years. The winner of multiple Emmy Awards, Siegel also worked as a radio disc jockey and an advertising copywriter.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family of Romanian descent, Siegel was raised in Los Angeles. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from the University of California, Los Angeles. His Romanian-born grandmother from Botoşani survived the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in March 1911. During college, Siegel worked to register black voters in Georgia during the Civil Rights Movement, and he spoke frequently of having met Martin Luther King Jr. He also worked as a joke writer for Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was at the Ambassador Hotel the night the senator was assassinated. According to some reports, he also led student opposition to the construction of a football stadium on campus.

==Career==

=== Early work ===
Siegel worked at a range of jobs throughout the 1960s, often concentrating on the civil rights movement. In the late &#x27;60s, before moving to New York, he worked as an advertising agency copy-writer and producer. While working in advertising for Carson/Roberts Advertising, he invented and named ice cream flavors for Baskin-Robbins. These flavors were: German Chocolate Cake; Peaches &amp; Cream; Pralines &amp; Cream; Blueberry Cheesecake; Strawberry Cheesecake; Green Cheesecake; Red, White and Blueberry; and Chilly Burgers.

He began working in radio as a disc jockey and newscaster, while continuing to freelance in advertising. Through his freelance work, he was offered the book review position with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

Siegel&#x27;s essays in the &quot;Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine&quot; were spotted by a CBS executive, and Siegel was hired as a feature correspondent for WCBS-TV in New York. Joel created signature work teamed with a producer who later became an executive at WABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;. When Siegel&#x27;s producer moved, he offered Siegel a featured on-air position, and Joel accepted. Siegel proposed to &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; management that he become a film and theatre critic. He suggested that he would innovate the form by using brief clips from the movie or show being reviewed as drop-ins into his reviews, working them into his scripts as gags to create a new, witty form of review. Siegel, during his years at WCBS-TV, also created features on the AM radio side for WCBS (880) known as &quot;Joel Siegel&#x27;s New York&quot;.

In 1986, &quot;Spy&quot; magazine derided Siegel as &quot;the poor man&#x27;s Gene Shalit&quot;, who relied &quot;heavily on alliteration.&quot;

===&quot;Good Morning America&quot; and later career===
In 1981, he joined &quot;Good Morning America&quot; (&quot;GMA&quot;) as a film critic. While Siegel worked at his reviewing, he wrote the book for &quot;The First&quot;, a Broadway musical based on the story of Jackie Robinson, for which he received a Tony Award nomination in 1982. This marks him as the only drama critic to receive this nomination. In 1999, Siegel was also one of the many guest critics on Roger Ebert&#x27;s show &quot;At The Movies&quot; as a replacement for Gene Siskel following his death. Siegel was also a good friend of Roger Ebert.

==Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
Siegel&#x27;s second wife, Jane Kessler, died from a brain tumor in 1982. In 1991, he joined with the actor Gene Wilder to found Gilda&#x27;s Club, a nonprofit organization that provided social support for cancer patients and their families in honor of Wilder&#x27;s wife, Gilda Radner.

On June 21, 1996, Siegel married his fourth wife, artist Ena Swansea. In 1997, at 53 years, he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. One week after being diagnosed, Siegel found out he would be a father for the first time. He wrote the book &quot;Lessons for Dylan&quot; which shares the ups and downs of his life with his young son, as he might not live long enough to relate those stories in person. Siegel underwent surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. He welcomed his newborn son, Dylan Thomas Jefferson Swansea Siegel, home on the same day he completed his chemotherapy treatments. Two years later, a CAT scan revealed a lesion on Siegel&#x27;s left lung. After a pulmonary lobectomy and additional chemotherapy, Siegel continued to work on &quot;GMA&quot;.

=== Activism === 
He was outspoken on the subject of colon cancer, and in 2005, spoke at a meeting of C-Change, a group of cancer experts from government, business, and nonprofit sectors, chaired by former President George H. W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush. He testified before the Senate during Colorectal Cancer Awareness month, March 2005. &quot;I came here from New York City this morning hoping that I would encourage someone to have a colonoscopy so that they would not have to go through what I went through&quot;, he told a Senate panel. In June 2005, Siegel published a letter in the peer-reviewed cancer medicine journal, &quot;The Oncologist&quot; entitled, &quot;One at a Time&quot;. It shares his cancer diagnosis and experiences to that date.

On May 10, 2007, less than two months before his death, he spoke before the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, an association of corporate executives that was formed when former President George H. W. Bush asked corporate America to do something &quot;bold and venturesome&quot; about cancer. Bush and his wife Barbara were in the audience when Joel spoke on May 10 at the Essex House in New York City. He began and ended his presentation by saying, &quot;I want to thank you for what you are doing for cancer patients.&quot;

=== Death ===
Siegel died from metastatic colon cancer on June 29, 2007, shortly before what would have been his 64th birthday. Following his death, Roger Ebert wrote a tribute to Joel and stated in the tribute that Joel was &quot;a brave man, and a hell of a nice guy.&quot;

==Awards==
Siegel received five New York Emmy Awards and a public service award from the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith and the New York State Associated Press Broadcasters Association Award for general excellence in individual reporting.

<text>In a photograph, the area of critical focus is the portion of the picture that is optically in focus. This does not relate to depth of field which describes apparent sharpness. 
Reducing the size of the aperture will increase the depth of field but the plane of critical focus will not change. Depth of field extends away from the plane of critical sharpness.

The image is only critically in focus within a plane. 
The formula that describes the relationship between plane of sharpness, lens and film is
:formula_1,
where formula_2 is the film to lens distance, formula_3 is the distance from the lens to the plane of critical focus (in the object space), and formula_4 is the focal length of the lens.

&#x27;Critical Focus&#x27; is also the title of a regular column by Brian J. Ford in the American magazine &quot;The Microscope&quot;.

<doc id="1114866" wikidata="Q58040" url="?curid=1114866" title="Andre Gunder Frank">
<text>Andre Gunder Frank (February 24, 1929 – April 25, 2005) was a German-American sociologist and economic historian who promoted dependency theory after 1970 and world-systems theory after 1984. He employed some Marxian concepts on political economy, but rejected Marx&#x27;s stages of history, and economic history generally.

==Biography==
Born Andreas Frank in Weimar Germany, his parents were the socialist and pacifist writer Leonhard Frank and his second wife Elena Maqenne Penswehr. His family, which was of Jewish origins, fled from Germany when the Nazis came to power. Frank was educated a various schools in Switzerland before the family emigrated to the United States in 1941. The young Frank participated without much success in track and field competitions, earning the ironic nickname &quot;Gunder&quot; (after the Swedish running champion Gunder Hägg) from his high-school teammates. Frank later simplified his first name to &quot;Andre&quot; and adopted &quot;Gunder&quot; as a middle name.

In the United States, Frank attended Swarthmore College (which had been founded as a Quaker institution), gaining an economics degree in 1950. He then moved to the University of Chicago as a graduate student in the economics department, but he was forced out after only one year. Frank received a master&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of Michigan and later spent some time among the beatniks in San Francisco, before returning to Chicago in 1955 as a research assistant in Bert Hoselitz&#x27;s Center for Economic Development and Cultural Change (CEDCC). In 1958 he received a Ph.D. degree in economics from the University of Chicago, with a dissertation entitled &quot;Growth and Productivity in Ukrainian Agriculture from 1928 to 1955&quot;. Although various sources later claimed that Frank&#x27;s doctoral supervisor had been Milton Friedman (whose &quot;laissez faire&quot; approach to economics Frank would later harshly criticize), Frank in fact received his degree under the direction of Hoselitz.

Frank was an assistant professor of economics at Michigan State University (MSU), but in the early 1960s he became disillusioned with academic life in the US and took a leave of absence from MSU. In 1962 he moved to Latin America, inaugurating a remarkable period of travel that confirmed his peripatetic tendencies. His most notable work during this time was his stint as Professor of Sociology and Economics at the University of Chile, where he was involved in reforms under the socialist government of Salvador Allende. After Allende&#x27;s government was toppled by a coup d&#x27;état in 1973, Frank fled to Europe, where he occupied a series of university positions. From 1981 until his retirement in 1994 he was professor in developmental economy at the University of Amsterdam.

He was married to Marta Fuentes, with whom he wrote several studies about social movements, and with Marta he had two sons. Marta died in Amsterdam in June 1993. His second wife was sociologist Nancy Howell, a friend for forty years: while married to her, they lived in Toronto. Frank died in 2005 of complications related to his cancer while under the care of his third wife, Alison Candela.

==Works and ideas==
During his career, Frank taught and did research in departments of anthropology, economics, geography, history, international relations, political science, and sociology. He worked at nine universities in North America, three in Latin America, and five in Europe. He gave countless lectures and seminars at dozens of universities and other institutions all around the world in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German and Dutch. Frank wrote widely on the economic, social and political history and contemporary development of the world system, the industrially developed countries, and especially of the Third World and Latin America. He produced over 1,000 publications in 30 languages. His last major article, &quot;East and West&quot;, appeared in the volume: &quot;Dar al Islam. The Mediterranean, the World System and the Wider Europe: The &quot;Cultural Enlargement&quot; of the EU and Europe&#x27;s Identity&quot; edited by Peter Herrmann (University College Cork) and Arno Tausch (Innsbruck University), published by Nova Science Publishers, New York.

His work in the 1990s focused on world history. He returned to his analysis of global political economy in the new millennium inspired by a lecture he gave at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga (SSE Riga). In 2006 SSE Riga received Andre Gunder Frank&#x27;s personal library collection and set-up the Andre Gunder Frank Memorial Library in his honor, with the support of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.

Frank was a prolific author, writing 40 books. He published widely on political economy, economic history, international relations, historical sociology, and world history. Perhaps his most notable work is &quot;Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America.&quot; Published in 1967, it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory. In his later career he produced works such as &quot;ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age&quot; and, with Barry Gills, &quot;The World System: Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand&quot;. Frank&#x27;s theories center on the idea that a nation&#x27;s economic strength, largely determined by historical circumstances—especially geography—dictates its global power. He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries. Frank has made significant contributions to the world-systems theory (which, according to him, should simply be called the World System), insisting that the idea of numerous &quot;world-systems&quot; did not make much sense (indeed, if there are many &quot;world-systems&quot; in the world, then they simply do not deserve to be called &quot;world-systems&quot;), and we should rather speak about one single World System. He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the &quot;long 16th century&quot; (a position held, for example, by Immanuel Wallerstein). 

In one of his last essays, Frank made arguments about the looming global economic crisis of 2008.

<text>The Loir is a long river in western France. It is a left tributary of the Sarthe. Its source is in the Eure-et-Loir department, north of Illiers-Combray. It joins the river Sarthe in Briollay, north of the city of Angers.

It is indirectly a tributary of the Loire, and runs roughly parallel to it and slightly north of it for much of its length, and so might be regarded as a Yazoo type river.

<text>Hans Otto Jespersen (born 21 July 1954) is a Norwegian comedian, actor and television personality. He starred as the title role of the 2010 film &quot;Trollhunter&quot; and the Norwegian voice actor of Manny in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; films.

==Biography==
At the age of 19 Jespersen became a Marxist-Leninist, and was briefly a member of the Communist organization Red Youth. Working in a local radio station, Radio Nova in Oslo, in 1988 Jespersen and collaborators Stig Holmer and launched the magazine programme &quot;Revolvermagasinet&quot; on Norwegian national radio. This night-time show featured unusual interviews. In 1992, the three again teamed up for &quot;The Show - storbymoro for enslige i Utkant-Norge&quot; on national television. &quot;The Show&quot; became the Norwegian candidate for the Rose d&#x27;Or in 1993, but several judges left the theatre before the programme was over.

During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Jespersen was hired as stunt reporter for Norwegian national television. This led to the first of the four &quot;O.J.&quot; series, in which Jespersen interviewed celebrities and later created such characters as Tårnfrid, Wirrum, Den ensomme rytter, Baron Blod, Nazi-Per, and Birger as well as Friskusen. He has also made two seasons of &quot;Trotto Libre&quot; with Trond Kirkvaag.

In 2002 he joined fellow comedians Silje Stang and to host the weekly comedy show &quot;Torsdagsklubben&quot;, gaining a reputation for his scathing closing monologue. Stang and Giertsen had formerly run the same show concept under the name &quot;Mandagsklubben&quot;.

In the autumn of 2002, Jespersen&#x27;s closing monologue targeted the Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, ridiculing the man&#x27;s medication use and his unpopularity. He finished the programme by encouraging &quot;all good forces&#x27;&quot; to invite Christer Pettersson, a suspect in the murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, to Oslo. Bondevik denounced the monologue in an interview calling it cowardly and distasteful, sparking debate about the monologue in Norway. In the wake of the controversy, Jespersen received a number of death threats.

He burned an American flag live on television in protest against the coming 2003 invasion of Iraq.

His television show &quot;&quot; premiered in early 2005. Among the show&#x27;s recurring contributors are and were Zahid Ali, a Norwegian-Pakistani comedian; Pia Haraldsen; and Espen Eckbo, an actor. In spring 2006, while shooting a stunt for the show in the city of Ålesund, Jespersen and Mayor Arve Tonning lit a bonfire in the centre of town and burned some Norwegian books and paper money. To the mayor&#x27;s consternation, Jespersen then added several pages from the Bible&#x27;s Old Testament, leading to national press coverage.

In 2008, when Jespersen mourned the fleas and lice on Holocaust victims, a &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; opinion article decried Norwegian television channel TV 2&#x27;s defence of this incident, using it as an example of growing anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiments in Norway.

<text>Richard Schultz Schweiker (June 1, 1926 – July 31, 2015) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 14th U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1983. He previously served as a U.S. Representative (1961–1969) and a U.S. Senator (1969–1981) from Pennsylvania. In 1976, Schweiker was Reagan&#x27;s running mate during his unsuccessful presidential campaign.

== Early life ==
Schweiker was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, on June 1, 1926, the son of Malcolm Alderfer Schweiker Sr. and his wife, the former Blanche R. Schultz. His father and his uncle worked in the tiling business for several decades. He was born into a family of Schwenckfelders and was a member of the church himself.

Schweiker received his early education at public schools in Worcester, and graduated from Norristown Area High School as valedictorian in 1944. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy aboard the aircraft carrier , being discharged with the rank of electronics technician (second class) in 1946.

Following his military service, Schweiker attended Slippery Rock State College for two years before transferring to Pennsylvania State University. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Penn State in 1950, graduating as a member of the Phi Kappa Sigma. He then joined his family&#x27;s business, American Olean Tile Company, rising from an assistant in the personnel department to the company&#x27;s president within a few years. He also became active in local Republican politics, serving as a precinct committeeman, and founded the Montgomery County chapter of the Young Republicans, of which he was president from 1952 to 1954. He was selected as an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1952 and in 1956.

== Marriage and family ==
On September 10, 1955, Schweiker married Claire Joan Coleman, a former host of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Romper Room&quot;, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1954–1956). They had two sons and three daughters.

== Political career ==

===U.S. House of Representatives===
In 1960, Schweiker was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 13th congressional district. At the time, the Montgomery County-based district included Schweiker&#x27;s home town of Norristown and several affluent suburban communities in the Philadelphia Main Line. A moderate to liberal Republican, he defeated conservative incumbent John A. Lafore, Jr., in the Republican primary. In the general election, he defeated Democrat Warren Ballard, a law professor at Temple University, 62%–38%. He was elected to three more terms, never receiving less than 59% of the vote.

During his tenure in the House, Schweiker served on the Armed Services Committee and the Government Operations Committee. He sponsored legislation, signed into law in 1965, that provided cash awards to United States Armed Forces personnel for cost-cutting ideas. Schweiker voted for the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also supported the creation of Medicare, increases in Social Security, and federal rent subsidies. He considered running for governor of Pennsylvania in 1966, but state Republican leaders persuaded him not to in favor of then-Lieutenant Governor Raymond P. Shafer.

===U.S. Senate===
In 1968, Schweiker was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating two-term Democratic incumbent Joseph S. Clark, Jr., by more than 280,000 votes. He was the only successful Republican statewide candidate in an election that saw Hubert Humphrey win Pennsylvania by over 170,000 votes. Continuing his progressive reputation in the Senate, Schweiker opposed the Vietnam War and President Richard Nixon&#x27;s nominations of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to the U.S. Supreme Court, and had an 89% rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action. He also supported school prayer and opposed stronger widespread gun control. In 1975, alongside fellow Republicans Clifford Case and Jacob Javits, Schweiker was a co-sponsor of Ted Kennedy&#x27;s Health Security Act, a bill proposing universal health coverage in America through a government-run program.

During his tenure in the Senate, Schweiker served as the ranking member on both the Labor and Human Resources Committee and the Labor, Health, and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee. He was a pioneer in increasing government spending on diabetes mellitus research, authoring and sponsoring of the National Diabetes Mellitus Research and Education Act. This legislation, passed by Congress in 1974, established the National Commission on Diabetes to create a long-term plan to fight the disease.

Schweiker was reelected in 1974, defeating his Democratic opponent, Pittsburgh mayor Peter F. Flaherty, in a year when many Republican incumbents lost due to political fallout from the Watergate scandal. He won 53% of the vote, the highest of any senator from Pennsylvania since 1946 at the time. He was the first Republican senator ever endorsed by the Pennsylvania AFL–CIO, and received 49% of the vote in heavily Democratic Philadelphia.

====Church Committee====
From 1975 to 1976, Schweiker was a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, headed by Idaho Senator Frank Church, investigating illegal domestic activities of the United States government&#x27;s intelligence agencies. The &quot;Church Committee&quot; found that allegations of CIA plots to assassinate Cuban Premier Fidel Castro during John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidency went unreported to the Warren Commission even though CIA director Allen Dulles was a member of the Commission. These findings led Schweiker to call for a reinvestigation of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. Church appointed Schweiker and Colorado Senator Gary Hart to be a two-person subcommittee to look into the &quot;performance or non-performance&quot; of intelligence agencies during the initial investigation of the assassination. In October 1975, Schweiker said at a press conference that the subcommittee had developed &quot;significant leads&quot; and was investigating three conspiracy theories, adding, &quot;I think the Warren Commission is like a house of cards. It&#x27;s going to collapse.&quot; In its final report, the Church Committee called the initial investigation deficient and criticized the response of CIA and FBI, but stated that it had &quot;not uncovered any evidence sufficient to justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.&quot;

On May 14, 1976, Schweiker told &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; that he believed the CIA and FBI had lied to the Warren Commission. On June 27, 1976, he appeared on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and said that the Commission made a &quot;fatal mistake&quot; by relying on the CIA and FBI instead of its own investigators. Schweiker also said that he felt it was possible that the White House was involved in a cover-up.

===Vice Presidential consideration===
In 1976, Ronald Reagan made a serious challenge against President Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries. Immediately before the opening of the 1976 Republican National Convention, Reagan attempted to attract moderate delegates by promising to name Schweiker, who had a moderate voting record in the Senate, as his running mate. This was unusual because the tradition was for a nominee to name a running mate only after winning the nomination. In response, conservative Republicans, including U.S. Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, encouraged a movement to draft Conservative Party U.S. Senator James L. Buckley of New York as the G.O.P. nominee. Ford won the nomination on the first ballot by a razor-thin margin and selected Bob Dole for vice president.

Reagan&#x27;s naming him as his running mate came as a surprise to Schweiker, as the two did not know each other. Schweiker subsequently adopted a much more conservative voting record; his rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action dropped to 15% in 1977.

In 1980, Schweiker announced he would not seek reelection to the Senate.

==Health secretary==
Schweiker accepted President Reagan&#x27;s appointment as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services in January 1981. He held the post until he resigned in February 1983. During his tenure, he worked with Reagan and House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill to reform Social Security, put greater emphasis on preventive medicine, reduce Medicare and food stamp grants to the states, and restrict welfare eligibility. He proposed reducing Social Security benefits to recipients who retired before age 65, but both Democrats and Republicans in Congress rejected the idea.

==Political legacy==
During his tenure in public service, Schweiker was an ardent supporter of a volunteer army. He coauthored the book &quot;How to End the Draft&quot;, eventually used as the blueprint for shifting the country to a fully volunteer army. He also pushed for the Schweiker Act of 1965, which gave cash awards to military personnel who suggested money-saving ideas, ultimately resulting in savings of more than $1 billion to taxpayers.

As ranking Republican on the Senate health subcommittee, Schweiker worked on legislation to combat diabetes, cancer, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, and lead paint poisoning. He focused heavily on diabetes and authored bills creating the National Commission on Diabetes Advisory Board, pushing for passage of the National Diabetes Act in 1972. Those efforts led to increased federal funding for diabetes programs and were a prototype for legislatively constructing a research effort across all National Institutes of Health operations and the Centers for Disease Control. Some who worked with Schweiker or benefited from his initiative called him the &quot;Patron Saint of the Pancreas&quot; for his devotion to the cause.

==Later life and death==
From 1983 to 1994, Schweiker served as president of the American Council of Life Insurance, now known as the American Council of Life Insurers. He lived McLean, Virginia, for many years. At the time of his death, he lived with one of his daughters in Herndon, Virginia. He also owned a home in Ocean City, New Jersey.

On July 31, 2015, Schweiker died of complications from an infection at the AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Pomona, New Jersey.

==Reception==
In his 1980 review, Vance Bourjaily said: 

Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called it &quot;a festival of bad taste that is at heart so innocent that we soon forgive it and enjoy ourselves,&quot; &quot;thoroughly juvenile fun,&quot; and said &quot;I haven&#x27;t had so much fun of this sort since my last all-night joke-telling session at summer camp.&quot;

Movieweb named it as one of 8 Roald Dahl books that need a screen adaptation.

<doc id="1114892" wikidata="Q1606948" url="?curid=1114892" title="Peter Benton">
<text>Peter Benton, M.D. is a fictional character from the NBC medical drama series &quot;ER,&quot; portrayed by actor Eriq La Salle, appearing as a primary character from the pilot episode until part way through the eighth season.

La Salle made two guest appearances in later episodes of the eighth season, before returning again for two more episodes in the fifteenth season, including the series finale.

==Casting==
Although Benton was an original character, according to an interview La Salle gave in 1997, he was cast late in the role, after the first season had already started filming. He recalled, &quot;I was surprisingly calm. When casting waits that long, they&#x27;re basically waiting for someone to come in and take the role. I was ready and completely focused. I came into the office with a stethoscope and surgical greens I had left over from [a previous role in] &quot;The Human Factor&quot;. When I left, I wanted them to say &#x27;That&#x27;s Dr. Benton&#x27;&quot;. Within three days of his audition, La Salle was offered the role of Dr. Benton.

==Development==

The name of the character was inspired by The Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now part of the Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts) which was a teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School, where series originator Michael Crichton studied medicine, although (perhaps coincidentally) the birth name of Crichton&#x27;s wife at the time, Anne-Marie Martin, was also Benton.

Several relationships were scripted into the character&#x27;s narrative. In Season 4 he began dating Dr. Elizabeth Corday, played by Alex Kingston. Both surgeons and the characters competed with each other professionally and failed to be adequately supportive of each other in their personal crises, so Corday ends the relationship in Season 5. According to an article published in &quot;Jet&quot; in 1999, Eriq La Salle was the reason why the romance dissolved. He was unhappy that Benton&#x27;s interracial romance with Corday was being shown as less problematic than his prior romances with black characters, such as Jeanie Boulet (played by Gloria Reuben) and Carla Reese (played by Lisa Nicole Carson). In an interview, La Salle stated, &quot;As an African-American man, it becomes a bit offensive if the negative things are all you&#x27;re showing. Because in real life we romance and get on each other&#x27;s nerves and laugh and do all the things that any other race of people do. So if the only time you show a balanced relationship is in an interracial relationship, whether it&#x27;s conscious or sub-conscious, it sends a message I&#x27;m not comfortable with.&quot; Mindful of the image that he was portrayed on television, La Salle asked producers to end Benton&#x27;s interracial romance. While being interviewed by Johnnie Cochran on &quot;Johnnie Cochran Tonight&quot;, La Salle commented, &quot;We have to take care of the message that we&#x27;re sending as African-Americans or any other group of minorities, that we have the exact same type of exchanges with our mates that we get to see our White counterparts have.&quot; In a subsequent episode, Benton was shown to be compassionate to his former girlfriend, Jeanie.

== Early days ==

Benton was first introduced in the pilot as a second-year surgical resident. When all the attending surgeons are occupied in other surgeries, Benton decides to operate without supervision to control a bleeding aneurysm and keep a man alive until a qualified surgeon is available. Although he does this technically against regulations, he is supported after the fact by attending physician (and ER chief) David Morgenstern.

== Family and friends ==

=== Jackie and Peter&#x27;s mother ===

In Season 1, we learn that Dr. Benton&#x27;s mother has had a stroke and is mostly being cared for by his sister Jackie, who wants to move her into an assisted living facility, an option to which Peter is strongly opposed. One night when Benton is watching his mother in Jackie&#x27;s home, she falls down the stairs and breaks her hip.

=== Jeanie Boulet ===

Benton meets Jeanie Boulet, a married Physician Assistant, at the hospital. Impressed, he hires her to work with his mother as a physical therapist. Benton&#x27;s mother dies, devastating him, and when Jeanie comforts him, they end up having an affair. In Season 2, Benton&#x27;s affair with Jeanie ends. Jeanie separates from her husband Al and learns that he contracted HIV from an affair, and furthermore that he passed the disease on to her; however, Jeanie does not pass the virus to Peter.

=== Carla Reese ===

In Season 3, Peter becomes involved with a former girlfriend, Carla Reese, who soon becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a son, Reese Benton, who is born prematurely. It is later discovered that, possibly from complications from Reese&#x27;s prematurity or his NICU treatment, the boy is deaf. Peter, at first, has difficulty accepting that his son is deaf and looks into surgeries to restore his ability to hear, but he later makes his peace with who Reese is, and he and Carla teach him to communicate through sign language. Later, Carla begins a new relationship with a man named Roger McGrath (which she clumsily, and unsuccessfully, tried to keep a secret from a non-plussed Peter) and eventually marries him. At the end of Season 5, Carla more or less tells Peter that her new marriage to Roger means she will be taking Reese with them to Roger&#x27;s new job in Germany and responds to Peter&#x27;s shocked and angry response by saying &quot;this WILL happen&quot;.

At the start of Season 6, legal proceedings have begun over Peter&#x27;s refusal to agree to Carla&#x27;s demands. Carla once again angers Peter by whining that he should just step aside and agree with her and then shocks Peter by telling him that he may not be Reese&#x27;s father, saying that she needed him to be a father at the time but Roger can fill that role in the future (back in Season 3, Carla was angry when Peter asked if she was sure he was the father). Peter takes a DNA test to determine whether or not Carla&#x27;s suspicions are true, but he chooses not to receive the results and decides he will be Reese&#x27;s father regardless of biology. Carla does not respond to Peter&#x27;s pleas to end the legal fight, but on Christmas Eve shows up angrily at the hospital with Reese and bitterly tells him &quot;you win&quot; and sarcastically thanks him for ruining her and Roger&#x27;s lives, as Roger&#x27;s boss booted him from the Germany-based promotion over the time he spent in court and they will have to remain in Chicago; Peter bluntly says he is sorry about the job but not sorry that his son will remain in the same city as him. In Season 7, Carla shows up anew to openly flirt with Peter, cause problems between him and his new girlfriend Cleo Finch, and lie to Roger about Peter hitting on her to the point where Roger and Peter have an altercation in the ER.

In the 2nd episode of Season 8, Carla is killed in a car accident. Peter takes Reese into his full custody, but when Roger continues to appeal for time with his stepson, Peter insists that Roger move on with his life and stay away. Roger sues Peter for custody of Reese, and his lawyers force Peter to address the fact that he may not be Reese&#x27;s biological father. Peter takes another paternity test and this time learns the truth—he is not Reese&#x27;s biological father. Roger&#x27;s lawyer makes an issue of the long hours&#x27; Peter&#x27;s job demands, whereas Roger works from home and commands his own schedule.

During court, Peter perjures himself on the witness stand and proclaims that he has been given a new schedule with reduced working hours at County General Hospital. A furious Roger confronts Peter about lying, but quickly turns abusive when he dares Peter to hit him and then says Peter &quot;can&#x27;t give your sister a new kid!&quot; (Jackie Robbins’s son Jesse was murdered in Season 7 by gang members). Peter later goes to his supervisor, Dr. Robert Romano, and asks for such a schedule, but Romano cannot offer only daytime hours. Peter hands in his resignation, and he goes to the out-of-town clinic where his girlfriend Cleo Finch now works to try to get a job there. He is successful and gets the hours he had promised the judge, and he is awarded sole custody of Reese with Roger receiving visitation rights. When a saddened Roger brings Reese&#x27;s Christmas presents to the hospital later that day, Peter, knowing that Roger is important to Reese, tells Roger to come to his and Cleo&#x27;s home on Christmas Day and give the presents to Reese himself. He does tell Roger he is doing this not for Roger&#x27;s sake but for Reese and both men tacitly acknowledge Peter has won.

=== Elizabeth Corday ===

When British surgeon Dr. Elizabeth Corday starts work at County General Hospital, she is quickly attracted to Benton, though he initially disregards her attentions. At length, Elizabeth tells him she believes that he does not want to pursue a relationship with her because of their racial difference, and Benton finally grudgingly admits to her that &quot;I &quot;do&quot; have a problem dating white women.&quot; Professionally, Benton and Corday attempt to outdo each other several times and both are eventually given the opportunity to work with Dr. Robert Romano. Later in the year, Benton assists with a surgery performed by his mentor Dr. David Morgenstern. Morgenstern (who has been somewhat hesitant about surgery following his heart attack) makes a serious mistake that endangers the patient&#x27;s life. Benton shoves him out of the way to take over the operation, with Elizabeth walking in too late to see Morgenstern&#x27;s mistake but witnessing Benton&#x27;s actions toward Morgenstern. Benton is suspended and comes close to losing his job before Morgenstern finally comes forward with the videotape of the operation, which exonerates his former student.

Morgenstern then resigns from the hospital, and a distraught Peter begins an affair with Elizabeth. They remain together through much of the following two years, although their relationship eventually begins to suffer due to Peter&#x27;s needing to spend more time attending to Reese. Elizabeth helps him realize that their romance isn&#x27;t going anywhere, and they end their affair, though they remain close friends and colleagues. Their friendship is troubled, however, when Elizabeth approaches the hospital staff with the idea of a trauma surgical fellowship. Benton withdraws his tentative commitment to Romano&#x27;s cardiothoracic fellowship (which would be extremely time-consuming) and campaigns for and is granted the trauma fellowship. Elizabeth feels betrayed by Peter and, wishing to stay at County, takes Romano&#x27;s cardiothoracic fellowship offer.

Alex Kingston, who played Corday, later said: &quot;[Y]ou see interracial relationships all over the place [outside America]. I kind of naively thought it would be even more liberal in America. And it couldn&#x27;t have been further from the truth. In fact, I&#x27;m trying to think if there&#x27;s a television show right now [in 2013] where there&#x27;s an African American and Caucasian relationship. They&#x27;re few and far between.&quot;

=== Cleo Finch ===
In Season 6, Benton began dating Dr. Cleo Finch, an ER pediatrician. Their relationship was stormy because of Peter&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Carla, but in Season 8 they leave Chicago along with Benton&#x27;s son Reese to start a new life. Peter Benton and Cleo Finch transferred to a different hospital. In the season 15 episode &quot;Old Times,&quot; Benton is seen wearing a wedding ring, and it is assumed he and Cleo are now married.

=== John Carter ===

In the pilot episode, John Carter is introduced as a third-year medical student on his ER rotation. He is assigned to Benton, who proceeds to give Carter a hard time. They seldom get along and their personalities clash on many occasions. Benton is more ambitious and focused on surgery whereas Carter is more compassionate and willing to spend time with patients, a trait that &quot;drove [Benton] crazy&quot; as he put it to Cleo, although he considered Carter to be a talented and smart doctor. In Season 3, Benton develops appendicitis and Carter operates on him. However, Carter eventually decided to leave surgery for emergency medicine, a decision that caused him to clash with Benton. Nonetheless, the two have reconciled and, despite the fact that they have interacted less since Carter&#x27;s transition to emergency medicine, formed a deep friendship.

In Season 6, Benton was visibly concerned about Carter after he was stabbed by a schizophrenic patient and eventually operates on him along with Dr. Anspaugh. During the surgery, Benton has become protective of Carter and expresses reluctance to leave his former protégé for another patient. Soon after, upon hearing Carter becoming addicted to painkillers, he refuses to watch Carter self-destruct and convinces Carter to enter rehab.

In Season 8, before Dr. Benton departs County General, his final farewell is to Carter. As a going-away present, Carter hands Benton a train token; it is the same one Benton had given him shortly after he started in the ER. Carter was left exhausted and distraught after a shift where the ER had handled a mass casualty, and when he admitted the night had devastated him and Benton simply gave him the token and said that if he was serious about being a good doctor, he would use it to come back to work the next day. Carter did return for his scheduled shift but kept that token as a reminder of what the job entailed.

In Season 15, he reunited with Carter when he was in need of a kidney transplant. Benton supervises the operation at the hospital where he works and makes sure that his old friend and colleague get the best medical support. As Benton knew that Carter has gone to Africa for the past 4 years, it is likely that both doctors kept in limited contact with each other while working at different hospitals.

== Career ==

Dr. Romano eventually offers Benton an attending trauma surgeon position, but when a Medicare patient needs surgery that Romano refuses to allow to be performed, Benton calls social services and informs them of the refusal of care. Romano intercepts the patient as social services arrive and performs the surgery, but he is enraged at Peter for calling them. Romano then retracts the idea of an attending trauma surgeon, explaining to Peter that the fines social services and Medicare inflicted on the hospital roughly equal what Peter&#x27;s yearly salary would have been. Romano then offers Benton a per diem surgical position with reduced benefits and more difficult scheduling, but Benton refuses. Romano also uses his considerable influence to blacklist Benton throughout the medical community, making it impossible for Benton to find a job in Chicago. Corday finds a new job for him in Philadelphia, but Carla will not continue joint custody of Reese if Peter leaves town (citing Peter&#x27;s resistance to her and her husband Roger&#x27;s plans to move the year before). Peter is then forced to go to Romano and accept the per diem position.

After the court battle between Roger and himself, Benton is forced to move away from County to work better hours in another hospital, in order to gain custody of Reese. In his last surgery at County, Benton miraculously saves a six-year-old victim of a shooting accident.

== After County General ==
After leaving the series, Benton was seen a few more times. The first time was when he was passing the torch to Dr. Corday and she told him that her marriage to Benton&#x27;s friend and colleague Dr. Mark Greene was in trouble. His next appearance was at the funeral of Greene. Benton appears in a photo as part of a slideshow at Dr. Carter&#x27;s farewell party, and Benton is heard in a voiceover memory as Carter leaves the ER for the last time in the 11th-season finale. Eriq La Salle made an uncredited appearance in the opening of &quot;Heal Thyself&quot; to tell the audience of the death of the show&#x27;s creator Michael Crichton.

== Season 15==
During the 15th and final season of &quot;ER&quot;, at the end of the episode &quot;The Book of Abby&quot;, long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Among them, the tag &quot;Benton&quot; can be seen.

Benton returns in the 19th episode of the 15th (final) season of &quot;ER&quot; in the episode &quot;Old Times&quot; which first was broadcast on 12 March 2009. In the episode, he visits an old friend and former student John Carter who is awaiting a kidney transplant, and it is revealed that Benton has left private practice for a surgical attending position at Northwestern University Hospital now that Reese is thirteen. He is seen wearing a wedding ring, so it is assumed he has married Cleo Finch who Benton states is at home watching Reese. Benton decides to observe Carter&#x27;s transplant and Benton&#x27;s insistence on being thorough, which annoys the surgeon, allows a complication to be resolved and the surgery to be a success.

In the series finale, Benton goes to Carter&#x27;s opening of his new hospital with Reese. He also goes to the afterparty with Carter, Susan Lewis, and Kerry Weaver and meets Elizabeth Corday and Rachel Greene.

== Reception ==
Dr. Peter Benton was named the #10 Top TV Dad by SocialTechPop in 2011. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included him in their list of the &quot;21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever&quot;.

<text>The Swale is a tidal channel of the Thames estuary that separates the Isle of Sheppey from the rest of Kent. On its banks is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest which stretches from Sittingbourne to Whitstable in Kent. It is also a Ramsar internationally important wetland site and a Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. Parts of it are a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I, National Nature Reserves, a Kent Wildlife Trust nature reserve and a Local Nature Reserve.

== History ==

The name &quot;Swale&quot; is Old English in origin, and is believed to mean &quot;swirling, rushing river&quot;, or &quot;rushing water&quot;.

===Peri-glacial period===
At these times the Swale was a gully from what had been a sea channel in very warm periods. Namely before the Strait of Dover had swept away so much swampy land, accentuated by sea levels being lower, even to beyond the end of the ice age, i.e. in the mid seventh millennium BC, the coasts of Essex and Kent stretched much further into the North Sea. Sheppey formed part of mainland Britain. The Swale was a valley opening eastwards. As sea-levels rose again, water occupied its whole length. It and the very mouth of the Medway divide the Isle of Sheppey from the mainland.

===Roman Warm Period===
When the Romans arrived in Britain, the Swale was much wider, with one part of the Isle of Sheppey — now called the Isle of Harty or Harty — a separate island.

===Former ferries===
Two public ferries crossed the Swale. One operated between Oare and Harty, and the other between Murston (near Sittingbourne) and Elmley (another former hamlet and essentially attached islet). Harty is no longer separate but the marshlands gradually encroaching delineate it.

==Dredging and channel traffic==
The channel needs constant dredging for busy recreational and light vessel use.

==Bridges==
The Swale is crossed at its western end by two bridges: the Kingsferry Bridge and the later Sheppey Crossing.

== Nature ==
The Swale forms both a National Nature Reserve and a Special Protection Area: the eel grass, Ray&#x27;s knotgrass, white seakale, glassworts and golden samphire support rare and uncommon migrant butterflies and moths, including the Essex emerald, the ground lackey, the clouded yellow butterfly and rare hawk-moths.
Since 1968, it has also been a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

=== Birds ===
The Swale provides habitats for the following birds:
* Pied avocet at least 17 percent of Great Britain&#x27;s breeding population
* Marsh harrier at least 15 percent of Great Britain&#x27;s breeding population
* Mediterranean gull
* Bar-tailed godwit
* Eurasian golden plover
* Hen harrier
* Ringed plover
* Black-tailed godwit
* Grey plover
* knot
* pintail
* Common redshank
* Northern shoveler

<text>Lewis Edward Valentine M.A. (1 June 1893 – 1 March 1986) was a Welsh politician, Baptist pastor, author, editor, and Welsh-language activist. He was the first leader of the Welsh political party Plaid Cymru.

==Early life==
Valentine was born in Llanddulas, Conwy, the son of Samuel Valentine, a limestone quarryman, and his wife Mary. He began studying to go into the ministry of the Baptist church at the University College of North Wales, Bangor but his studies were curtailed due to the First World War.

==Founding Plaid Cymru==
His experiences in World War I, and his sympathy for the cause of Irish independence, brought him to Welsh nationalism, and in 1925 he met with Saunders Lewis, H. R. Jones, and others at a 1925 National Eisteddfod meeting, held in Pwllheli, Gwynedd, with the aim of establishing &quot;a Welsh party&quot;.

Discussions for the need of a &quot;Welsh party&quot; had been circulating since the 19th century. With the generation or so before 1922 there &quot;had been a marked growth in the constitutional recognition of the Welsh nation,&quot; wrote historian Dr. John Davies. By 1924 there were people in Wales &quot;eager to make their nationality the focus of Welsh politics&quot;.

The principal aim of the new party would be to foster a Welsh speaking Wales. To this end it was agreed that party business be conducted in Welsh, and that members sever all links with other British parties. Valentine, Lewis and others insisted on these principles before they would agree to the Pwllheli conference.

According to the 1911 census, out of a population of just under 2.5 million, 43.5% of the total population of Wales spoke Welsh as a primary language. This was a decrease from the 1891 census with 54.4% speaking Welsh out of a population of 1.5 million.

With these prerequisites Lewis condemned &quot;&#x27;Welsh nationalism&#x27; as it had hitherto existed, a nationalism characterized by inter-party conferences, an obsession with Westminster and a willingness to accept a subservient position for the Welsh language,&quot; wrote Dr. Davies. It may be because of these strict positions that the party failed to attract politicians of experience in its early years. However, the party&#x27;s members believed its founding was an achievement in itself; &quot;merely by existing, the party was a declaration of the distinctiveness of Wales,&quot; wrote Dr. Davies.

During the inter-war years, &quot;Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru&quot; was most successful as a social and educational pressure group rather than as a political party.

==&quot;Tân yn Llŷn&quot; 1936==

Welsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK government settled on establishing a Royal Air Force training camp at Penyberth on the Llŷn peninsula in Gwynedd. The events surrounding the protest, known as &quot;Tân yn Llŷn&quot; (&quot;Fire in Llŷn&quot;), helped define &quot;Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru&quot;. The UK government settled on Llŷn as the site for its new bombing school after similar locations Northumberland and Dorset were met with protests.

However, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin refused to hear the case against building the &quot;bombing school&quot; in Wales, despite a deputation representing half a million Welsh protesters. Protest against the bombing school was summed up by Lewis when he wrote that the UK government was intent upon turning one of the &quot;essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature&quot; into a place for promoting a &quot;barbaric&quot; method of warfare. Construction of the bombing school building began exactly 400 years after the passage of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542.

On 8 September 1936 the bombing school building was set on fire and in the investigations which followed Saunders Lewis, Lewis Valentine, and D.J. Williams claimed responsibility. The trial at Caernarfon failed to agree on a verdict and the case was sent to the Old Bailey in London. The &quot;Three&quot; were sentenced to nine months imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs, and on their release they were greeted as heroes by fifteen thousand Welsh at the Pavilion Caernarfon.

Many Welsh were angered by the Judge&#x27;s scornful treatment of the Welsh language, by the decision to move the trial to London, and by the decision of University College, Swansea, to dismiss Saunders Lewis from his post before he had been found guilty. Dafydd Glyn Jones wrote of the fire that it was &quot;the first time in five centuries that Wales struck back at England with a measure of violence... To the Welsh people, who had long ceased to believe that they had it in them, it was a profound shock.&quot;

==Second World War==

&quot;Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru&quot; members were free to choose for themselves their level of support for the war effort. &quot;Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru&quot; was officially neutral regarding involvement the Second World War, which Valentine, Lewis and other leaders considered a continuation of the First World War. Central to the neutrality policy was the idea that Wales, as a nation, had the right to decide independently on its attitude towards war, along with opposition towards the UK government&#x27;s decision to involve Wales in the conflict. With this policy party leaders hoped a significant number of Welshmen would refuse to join the armed forces.

Lewis and other party members were attempting to strengthen loyalty to the Welsh nation &quot;over the loyalty to the British State.&quot; Lewis argued &quot;The only proof that the Welsh nation exists is that there are some who act as if it did exist.&quot;

However, most party members who claimed conscientious objection status did so in the context of their moral and religious beliefs, rather than on political policy. Of these almost all were exempt from military service. About 24 party members made politics their sole grounds for exemption, of which twelve received prison sentences. For Lewis, those who objected proved that the assimilation of Wales was &quot;being withstood, even under the most extreme pressures&quot;.

==Pastor, author, and editor==

As a pastor he served church in north Wales and edited the Baptist quarterly magazine, &quot;Seren Gomer&quot;, from 1951 to 1975. He also wrote of his experience in the war in &quot;Dyddiadur milwr&quot; (=A soldier&#x27;s diary), 1988.

Valentine is also famed as the writer of the hymn &quot;Gweddi dros Gymru&quot; (&quot;A prayer for Wales&quot;), usually sung to the tune of Jean Sibelius&#x27;s Finlandia Hymn. This is considered by some to be the second Welsh national anthem, and has been recorded and widely performed by Dafydd Iwan.

Whilst he was Baptist pastor at Llandudno, he translated a selection of Psalms called &quot;Detholiad o&#x27;r Salmau&quot;, which was published by Gwasg Ilston in 1936.

<text>&quot;The Visitor&quot; is a 1965 short story by British writer Roald Dahl, centred on the fictional Uncle Oswald and the lurid adventures he describes in his elaborate diaries. In this story, set in 1946, Oswald has amorous designs on his Syrian host&#x27;s wife and teenage daughter, with unfortunate and unexpected consequences.

==Plot==
Oswald becomes stranded for a night near Cairo at the desert mansion of a wealthy businessman, Abdul Aziz, whose wife and adult daughter are both very beautiful. Oswald plots to seduce either the wife or daughter, and believes he has succeeded after a woman slips into his bedroom under cover of darkness and spends several passionate hours with him, although he cannot see her face and she refuses to converse with him. The next day, Oswald leaves the house none the wiser as to which of the two women he has slept with. The story ends with a twist as Mr Aziz reveals to Oswald that he has a &quot;second&quot; daughter who lives in seclusion in another part of the house – because she has incurable leprosy.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Visitor&quot; was first published in the May 1965 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. It was later included in the 1974 collection &quot;Switch Bitch&quot;.

Norton H Moses states that Dahl&#x27;s story was likely expanded from an anecdote found in George &quot;Dod&quot; Orsborne&#x27;s &quot;Master of the Girl Pat&quot;, published in 1949. Orsborne presented the anecdote as factual, involving a writer known to an editor who then told the story to Orsborne.

Additionally, this story was told at least once by Ian Fleming, from whom Dahl got the plot of &quot;Lamb To The Slaughter&quot;. Dahl did not publish it until after Fleming&#x27;s death.

However, David Ogilvy recalled that Dahl had told the basic story orally as early as 1941, during their association together through British intelligence activities during World War II, with Dahl half-seriously presenting the tale as a true incident that had happened to &quot;a friend&quot;.

==In other media==
===Television===

In his later years, Alfred Hitchcock occasionally told this story as a black joke during his appearances on American talk shows, most notably during an appearance on &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot; on 29 May 1973.

&quot;Akhbar&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a 1987 television pilot associated with &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, bears many similarities to the Dahl and Orsborne stories.

Norm Macdonald tells a version of this story as a joke on his podcast &quot;Norm Macdonald Live&quot;, on season 2, episode 6.

<text>Nándor Hidegkuti (3 March 1922 – 14 February 2002) was a Hungarian football player and manager. He played as a forward or attacking midfielder and spent the majority of his playing career at MTK Hungária FC. During the 1950s he was also a key member of the Hungary national team known as the Golden Team. Other members of the team included Ferenc Puskás, Zoltán Czibor, Sándor Kocsis and József Bozsik. In 1953, playing as a &quot;deep lying centre-forward&quot;, a position which has retroactively been compared to the modern &quot;false 9&quot; role, he scored a hat-trick for Hungary when they beat England 6–3 at Wembley Stadium. Playing from deep, Hidegkuti was able to distribute the ball to the other attackers and cause considerable confusion to defences. This was an innovation at the time and revolutionised the way the game was played.

Hidegkuti died on 14 February 2002 after suffering from heart and lung problems for some time before his death. MTK Hungária FC renamed their stadium, Hidegkuti Nándor Stadium, in his honour.

==Club career==
Hidegkuti started his career in Elektromos FC and Herminamezei AC.

===MTK Budapest===
Hidegkuti began playing for MTK in 1947. In 1949 when Hungary became a communist state, MTK were taken over by the secret police, the ÁVH and subsequently the club changed their name several times. Initially they became &quot;Textiles SE&quot;, then &quot;Bástya SE&quot;, then &quot;Vörös Lobogó SE&quot; and then finally back to MTK. Despite this turmoil, the 1950s proved a successful era for club and it was while at MTK that Hidegkuti, together with Péter Palotás and coach Márton Bukovi, pioneered the deep lying centre-forward position. With a team that also included Mihály Lantos and József Zakariás, MTK and Hidegkuti won three Hungarian League titles, a Hungarian Cup and a Mitropa Cup. In 1955, as &quot;Vörös Lobogó SE&quot;, they also played in the first ever European Cup. Hidegkuti scored twice as they beat RSC Anderlecht 10–4 on aggregate in the first round. After retiring as a player, Hidegkuti also had two spells as a coach at MTK.

==International career==
Between 1945 and 1958 Hidegkuti earned 69 appearances and scored 39 goals for Hungary. He scored twice on his debut on 30 September 1945 in a 7–2 win against Romania. Two years later, on 17 August 1947, he made his second international appearance and scored a hat-trick against Bulgaria. On 18 November 1951 he scored another hat trick against Finland. He became a central player in the Golden Team of the early and mid-1950s; during this time, Ferenc Puskás, Sándor Kocsis and Hidegkuti provided the Hungarians a total of 198 goals.

Hidegkuti was used by the Golden Team as a deep lying centre-forward. In the 1950s, the majority of international sides still used the WM formation, where the defending centre half would traditionally mark the opposition&#x27;s centre forward – usually whoever was wearing the number 9 shirt. When a defending centre half attempted to mark Hidegkuti, they were drawn out of position, allowing the rest of the Hungarian team to exploit the space. At the time this was a revolutionary tactic, requiring the player in the deep lying centre-forward position to have excellent ball control, distribution skills and positional awareness.

Former England and Leeds United manager, Don Revie paid tribute to the influence of Hidegkuti in his autobiography: &quot;In the summer of 1954 England and Scotland were knocked out of the World Cup series in Switzerland. That competition was won by Germany, but dominated by Hungary, who played with a deep-lying centre forward, &quot;Nandor Hidegkuti&quot;. Alongside him; Sandor Kocsis and Ferenc Puskas, two of the greatest inside-forwards in the world. But whatever people claim of Kocsis and Puskas, it was the man Hidegkuti who tore the England defence to shreds at Wembley in November 1953. It was Hidegkuti, again playing his hide-and-seek centre-forward game, who shattered England in the return match in Budapest in May 1954, when we were thrashed 7–1.&quot; Sepp Herberger, manager of the West German team that would defeat Hungary in the 1954 World Cup final, identified Hidegkuti as the most important player in the Hungarian team (despite Puskas drawing a lot more public attention) and adjusted his tactics for the final to prevent him from playing out his game.

==Managerial career==

As a manager Hidegkuti coached clubs in Hungary, Italy, Poland and Egypt. In 1961 he guided Fiorentina to victory in the first ever European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, beating Rangers 4–1 on aggregate in the final. With Győri ETO he won the Hungarian League in 1963 and then took them to the semi-final of the 1964–65 European Cup where they lost to eventual runners-up, Benfica. In Egypt, Hidegkuti coached Al Ahly, introducing a 5–3–2 formation, he coached Al Ahly for seven seasons from 1973 to 1980.

For his model behaviour as a player and coach, he was awarded the 1993 FIFA Fair Play Award.

<text>The Indre () is a long river in central France, a left tributary to the Loire.

Its source is in the department of Cher, near Préveranges. It flows through the departments of Cher, Indre and Indre-et-Loire. It flows generally northwest, through the communes of La Châtre, Châteauroux and Loches.

It joins the Loire near the site of the Chinon nuclear power plant, north of Avoine.

Its main tributary is the Indrois, which joins at Azay-sur-Indre. A smaller tributary is the Trégonce.

Departments and towns along the river:
* Cher 
* Indre: La Châtre, Châteauroux
* Indre-et-Loire: Loches

<text>SSVOBB is the acronym for Stichting Studenten Vliegtuigontwikkeling, -bouw en -beheer which is Dutch for &quot;Foundation for Students in Airplane development, manufacturing and management&quot;.

==The Foundation==
The SSVOBB is a non-profit-foundation of students in Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology in Delft, Netherlands dedicated to giving students practical experience in the design, manufacture and flight of fixed-wing aircraft. The organisation was founded on January 19, 1990, when students of the faculty organised the building of their first aircraft the Lambach HL II.

==Lambach HL II==
===The original===
The original Lambach HL.II was commissioned by Dutch aviation enthusiasts to try to beat the superior German aerobatics aircraft in aerobatics contests. She was completely designed and build within six months by the Dutch engineer and Delft University of Technology graduate Hugo Lambach. The biplane had a steel tube, cloth-covered fuselage, wooden wings and tail and was powered by a Gipsy Major Mk. 1. After test flights she was successful at several air shows where she proved to be a unique aerobatics aircraft, although the German aircraft continued to win. The aircraft was destroyed during a German bombing raid on the Ypenburg Airport near The Hague on May 10, 1940.

===Hugo Lambach===
Hugo Lambach was a Delft graduate in applied physics. During his study he already designed and built his first aircraft, the Lambach HL.I. After graduation he worked with Koolhoven Vliegtuigfabrieken. With the commissioning of the Lambach HL II he started his own aircraft factory, Lambach Vliegtuigfabrieken, which ultimately only produced one aircraft. After the war he worked with Fokker for several years and had his own engineering company. Hugo Lambach died July 8, 1972.

===Replica===
The replica started out as a student&#x27;s joke in 1989 to organise a stunt in honour of the 45th anniversary of the &quot;Society of Aerospace Students &#x27;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;&#x27;. Thanks to a complete set of drawings found in the Aviodrome museum and the help of Hugo Lambach&#x27;s main engineer Willem de Koo, the students managed to complete the aircraft in six years. Her first flight took place on September 18, 1995. The aircraft was demonstrated at several air shows in the Netherlands and Belgium during 1996. In 1997 inspection showed the need for heavy maintenance which has grounded her since.

Maintenance continued on the replica while it was stored at the aviation museum Aviodrome, at Lelystad Airport. Maintenance was required to reinforce the engine mount to better handle engine vibrations and update the instrument panel. The panel needed to be updated to comply with modern regulation, as such the replica will, unlike the original, be equipped with radio and transponder.

On May 6, 2017 ownership of the aircraft was transferred to the Early Birds Foundation for further restoration, and the aircraft was re-entered into the Dutch aircraft register. Although it continues to be restored to flightworthy condition, Lambach Aircraft is no longer heavily involved in the project.

==The Impuls==
In 1994 the society started working on their second project: the Impuls (Dutch for momentum, registration PH-VXM (velocity times mass)), which was designed by the society&#x27;s students only. The design started in 1994, but by the summer of 2010 the society decided to freeze the project.

The Impuls concept consisted of a 2-seat FAR-23 certified aircraft, propelled by an engine in a pusher configuration. Other distinctive characteristics were the two tail booms and the large windows ensuring a broad view. Materials characterising the Impuls, were the (then state of the art) glass fibre composite used in wings, tail booms and outer fuselage shell. The inner fuselage however, still consisted of a load carrying steel inner frame as monocoque composite constructions were still very rare back in the &#x27;90s.

==The S-Vision==

In December 2009, SSVOBB Lambach Aircraft decided to freeze the Impuls-project and the remaining time of that academic year was used to make a thorough evaluation of the project. By the summer of 2010, after having conducted a feasibility study, the society decided to make a second attempt at building an own designed aircraft, which would later be named: S-Vision

Unlike the design of the Impuls, that of the S-Vision was substantially more conventional. The S- Vision was to have a low wing, fixed gear and single tail boom. The aircraft was to be certified according to EASA CS-VLA, which was introduced in 2003. Power will be generated by a four-cylinder opposing engine providing 130Hp driving the pull-prop. As the society gained experience in the manufacturing of composites and aluminium during the Impuls-project, these were chosen to be the main materials used in the S-Vision.

Design on the S-Vision started in September 2010 and in the following three years the conceptual and preliminary design were fully completed. By the spring of 2014 volunteers started working on material testing. Work ceased in 2016, as resources were focused on the restoration of the Lambach HL II replica.

==UAVs==
Lambach Aircraft transitioned to the design and construction of UAVs. Since 2018, the association has competed in BMFA Payload and Quantity Challenges, seeing varying success. In 2023, the association constructed an entry to the Vertical Flying Society (VFS) Student Design Competition, although did not ultimately compete. Lambach Aircraft is currently also developing &#x27;Project ATTIS&#x27;, a long-range UAV for imaging of conservation reserves, and conducting research into UAV wing manufacturing techniques. The association also runs its own &#x27;Introduction to RC UAV Manufacturing&#x27; course for first-year Delft University of Technology aerospace engineering students.

<text>St. Ita&#x27;s Hospital () is a mental health facility in Portrane in the north of County Dublin in Ireland.

==History==
The site selected for the facility, which covered , was the demesne surrounding Portrane House, the former home of the Evans family. The facility was the subject of a design competition which was won by George Ashlin but his proposed price exceeded the budgeted cost and he was asked to reduce the price: the eminent architect, Sir Thomas Drew, objected to Ashlin being selected on this basis. The facility, which was ultimately designed by Ashlin in the Gothic Revival style, opened as the Portrane Asylum in 1903. At a cost of 300,000 it was the most expensive building ever commissioned up to that time by the British Government in Ireland.

Irish republican Michael Staines was chairman of the hospital board and on one occasion spent the night there while on the run in 1920.

St. Ita&#x27;s Hospital Radio commenced broadcasting in December 1983 and was the first radio station in Ireland to receive one of the new broadcast licenses after the provisions of the Broadcasting bill were brought into operation in 1988.

After the introduction of deinstitutionalisation in the late 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline. Nearly 500,000 viewers watched an episode of the RTÉ documentary &quot;The Asylum&quot; which featured St Ita&#x27;s Hospital in 2005.

In June 2010, the Mental Health Commission instructed the hospital to stop the admission of acute patients on account of the &quot;entirely unacceptable and inhumane conditions&quot; by 28 February 2011. The hospital closed to inpatients in March 2011 and to outpatients as well in January 2014.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) announced in February 2012 that the Central Mental Hospital would relocate to the former site of the old St Ita&#x27;s Hospital. The new hospital was completed in 2020, however, construction work and industrial relations issues delayed the opening until November 2022.

<text>Paul John Teutul (born May 1, 1949) is the founder of Orange County Choppers, a manufacturer of custom motorcycles and the focus of the reality television series &quot;American Chopper&quot;. He first appeared on the show with his sons Paul Jr. and Michael. In 2013, his new show &quot;Orange County Choppers&quot; premiered on CMT.

==Early life==
Teutul was born in Yonkers, New York and grew up in Pearl River, New York. He enlisted as a member of the United States Merchant Marine during the Vietnam War.

==Career==
Teutul originally began with Orange County Ironworks, a fabrication shop now solely owned and managed by son Daniel Teutul. He began building custom bikes as a hobby after being inspired by the many custom bikes appearing on the streets and in films. In 1999, he left and founded Orange County Choppers. He began building bikes that quickly made their way to magazine covers, and center stage at every major motorcycle event. OCC landed on the hit reality show American Chopper.

==Family==
In addition to Paul Jr. and Mikey Teutul, Paul Sr. has two other children: Christin Teutul and Daniel &#x27;Dan&#x27; Teutul. Dan Teutul took over Orange County Ironworks when his father started building more bikes than buildings. His daughter Christin is a nurse in New York City who works in pediatrics. Paul Sr. has seven grandchildren.

Teutul&#x27;s regular arguments with his son Paul Jr. became a routine occurrence during episodes of &quot;American Chopper&quot;. These vocal disagreements eventually led to Paul Jr. being fired in September 2008.

<doc id="1114931" wikidata="Q3105146" url="?curid=1114931" title="Exotic sphere">
<text>In an area of mathematics called differential topology, an exotic sphere is a differentiable manifold &quot;M&quot; that is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-sphere. That is, &quot;M&quot; is a sphere from the point of view of all its topological properties, but carrying a smooth structure that is not the familiar one (hence the name &quot;exotic&quot;).

The first exotic spheres were constructed by in dimension formula_1 as formula_2-bundles over formula_3. He showed that there are at least 7 differentiable structures on the 7-sphere. In any dimension showed that the diffeomorphism classes of oriented exotic spheres form the non-trivial elements of an abelian monoid under connected sum, which is a finite abelian group if the dimension is not 4. The classification of exotic spheres by showed that the oriented exotic 7-spheres are the non-trivial elements of a cyclic group of order 28 under the operation of connected sum. These groups are known as Kervaire–Milnor groups.

More generally, in any dimension &quot;n ≠ 4&quot;, there is a finite Abelian group whose elements are the equivalence classes of smooth structures on &quot;S&quot;n, where two structures are considered equivalent if there is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism carrying one structure onto the other. The group operation is defined by [x] + [y] = [x + y], where x and y are arbitrary representatives of their equivalence classes, and &quot;x + y&quot; denotes the smooth structure on the smooth &quot;S&quot;n that is the connected sum of x and y. It is necessary to show that such a definition does not depend on the choices made; indeed this can be shown.

==Introduction==
The unit &quot;n&quot;-sphere, formula_4, is the set of all (&quot;n&quot;+1)-tuples formula_5 of real numbers, such that the sum formula_6. For instance, formula_7 is a circle, while formula_8 is the surface of an ordinary ball of radius one in 3 dimensions. Topologists consider a space &quot;X&quot; to be an &quot;n&quot;-sphere if there is a homeomorphism between them, i.e. every point in &quot;X&quot; may be assigned to exactly one point in the unit &quot;n&quot;-sphere by a continuous bijection with continuous inverse. For example, a point &quot;x&quot; on an &quot;n&quot;-sphere of radius &quot;r&quot; can be matched homeomorphically with a point on the unit &quot;n&quot;-sphere by multiplying its distance from the origin by formula_9. Similarly, an &quot;n&quot;-cube of any radius is homeomorphic to an &quot;n&quot;-sphere.

In differential topology, two smooth manifolds are considered smoothly equivalent if there exists a diffeomorphism from one to the other, which is a homeomorphism between them, with the additional condition that it be smooth — that is, it should have derivatives of all orders at all its points — and its inverse homeomorphism must also be smooth. To calculate derivatives, one needs to have local coordinate systems defined consistently in &quot;X&quot;. Mathematicians (including Milnor himself) were surprised in 1956 when Milnor showed that consistent local coordinate systems could be set up on the 7-sphere in two different ways that were equivalent in the continuous sense, but not in the differentiable sense. Milnor and others set about trying to discover how many such exotic spheres could exist in each dimension and to understand how they relate to each other. No exotic structures are possible on the 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6-, 12-, 56- or 61-sphere. Some higher-dimensional spheres have only two possible differentiable structures, others have thousands. Whether exotic 4-spheres exist, and if so how many, is an unsolved problem.

==Classification==
The monoid of smooth structures on &quot;n&quot;-spheres is the collection of oriented smooth &quot;n&quot;-manifolds which are homeomorphic to the &quot;n&quot;-sphere, taken up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphism. The monoid operation is the connected sum. Provided formula_10, this monoid is a group and is isomorphic to the group formula_11 of &quot;h&quot;-cobordism classes of oriented homotopy &quot;n&quot;-spheres, which is finite and abelian. In dimension 4 almost nothing is known about the monoid of smooth spheres, beyond the facts that it is finite or countably infinite, and abelian, though it is suspected to be infinite; see the section on Gluck twists. All homotopy &quot;n&quot;-spheres are homeomorphic to the &quot;n&quot;-sphere by the generalized Poincaré conjecture, proved by Stephen Smale in dimensions bigger than 4, Michael Freedman in dimension 4, and Grigori Perelman in dimension 3. In dimension 3, Edwin E. Moise proved that every topological manifold has an essentially unique smooth structure (see Moise&#x27;s theorem), so the monoid of smooth structures on the 3-sphere is trivial.

=== Parallelizable manifolds===
The group formula_11 has a cyclic subgroup

:formula_13

represented by &quot;n&quot;-spheres that bound parallelizable manifolds. The structures of formula_13 and the quotient

:formula_15

are described separately in the paper , which was influential in the development of surgery theory. In fact, these calculations can be formulated in a modern language in terms of the surgery exact sequence as indicated here.

The group formula_13 is a cyclic group, and is trivial or order 2 except in case formula_17, in which case it can be large, with its order related to the Bernoulli numbers. It is trivial if &quot;n&quot; is even. If &quot;n&quot; is 1 mod 4 it has order 1 or 2; in particular it has order 1 if &quot;n&quot; is 1, 5, 13, 29, or 61, and proved that it has order 2 if formula_18 mod 4 is not of the form formula_19. It follows from the now almost completely resolved Kervaire invariant problem that it has order 2 for all &quot;n&quot; bigger than 126; the case formula_20 is still open. The order of formula_21 for formula_22 is

:formula_23

where &quot;B&quot; is the numerator of formula_24, and formula_25 is a Bernoulli number. (The formula in the topological literature differs slightly because topologists use a different convention for naming Bernoulli numbers; this article uses the number theorists&#x27; convention.)

===Map between quotients===
The quotient group formula_15 has a description in terms of stable homotopy groups of spheres modulo the image of the J-homomorphism; it is either equal to the quotient or index 2. More precisely there is an injective map
:formula_27
where formula_28 is the &quot;n&quot;th stable homotopy group of spheres, and &quot;J&quot; is the image of the &quot;J&quot;-homomorphism. As with formula_13, the image of &quot;J&quot; is a cyclic group, and is trivial or order 2 except in case formula_17, in which case it can be large, with its order related to the Bernoulli numbers. The quotient group formula_31 is the &quot;hard&quot; part of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and accordingly formula_15 is the hard part of the exotic spheres, but almost completely reduces to computing homotopy groups of spheres. The map is either an isomorphism (the image is the whole group), or an injective map with index 2. The latter is the case if and only if there exists an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional framed manifold with Kervaire invariant 1, which is known as the Kervaire invariant problem. Thus a factor of 2 in the classification of exotic spheres depends on the Kervaire invariant problem.

The Kervaire invariant problem is almost completely solved, with only the case formula_33 remaining open, although Zhouli Xu (in collaboration with Weinan Lin and Guozhen Wang), announced during a seminar at Princeton University, on May 30, 2024, that the final case of dimension 126 has been settled and that there exist manifolds of Kervaire invariant 1 in dimension 126. Previous work of , proved that such manifolds only existed in dimension formula_34, and , which proved that there were no such manifolds for dimension formula_35 and above. Manifolds with Kervaire invariant 1 have been constructed in dimension 2, 6, 14, 30. While it is known that there are manifolds of Kervaire invariant 1 in dimension 62, no such manifold has yet been constructed. Similarly for dimension 126.

===Order of Θn===
The order of the group formula_11 is given in this table from (except that the entry for formula_37 is wrong by a factor of 2 in their paper; see the correction in volume III p. 97 of Milnor&#x27;s collected works).

Note that for dim formula_38, then formula_39 are formula_40, formula_41, formula_42, and formula_43. Further entries in this table can be computed from the information above together with the table of stable homotopy groups of spheres.

By computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres, proves that the sphere has a unique smooth structure, and that it is the last odd-dimensional sphere with this property – the only ones are , , , and .

==Explicit examples of exotic spheres==

=== Milnor&#x27;s construction ===

One of the first examples of an exotic sphere found by was the following. Let formula_44 be the unit ball in formula_45, and let formula_2 be its boundary—a 3-sphere which we identify with the group of unit quaternions. Now take two copies of formula_47, each with boundary formula_48, and glue them together by identifying formula_49 in the first boundary with formula_50 in the second boundary. The resulting manifold has a natural smooth structure and is homeomorphic to formula_51, but is not diffeomorphic to formula_51. Milnor showed that it is not the boundary of any smooth 8-manifold with vanishing 4th Betti number, and has no orientation-reversing diffeomorphism to itself; either of these properties implies that it is not a standard 7-sphere. Milnor showed that this manifold has a Morse function with just two critical points, both non-degenerate, which implies that it is topologically a sphere.

=== Brieskorn spheres ===
As shown by (see also ) the intersection of the complex manifold of points in formula_53 satisfying
:formula_54
with a small sphere around the origin for formula_55 gives all 28 possible smooth structures on the oriented 7-sphere. Similar manifolds are called Brieskorn spheres.

==Twisted spheres==
Given an (orientation-preserving) diffeomorphism formula_56, gluing the boundaries of two copies of the standard disk formula_57 together by &quot;f&quot; yields a manifold called a &quot;twisted sphere&quot; (with &quot;twist&quot; &quot;f&quot;). It is homotopy equivalent to the standard &quot;n&quot;-sphere because the gluing map is homotopic to the identity (being an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, hence degree 1), but not in general diffeomorphic to the standard sphere. 
Setting formula_58 to be the group of twisted &quot;n&quot;-spheres (under connect sum), one obtains the exact sequence
:formula_59

For formula_60, every exotic &quot;n&quot;-sphere is diffeomorphic to a twisted sphere, a result proven by Stephen Smale which can be seen as a consequence of the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem. (In contrast, in the piecewise linear setting the left-most map is onto via radial extension: every piecewise-linear-twisted sphere is standard.) The group formula_58 of twisted spheres is always isomorphic to the group formula_11. The notations are different because it was not known at first that they were the same for formula_63 or 4; for example, the case formula_63 is equivalent to the Poincaré conjecture.

In 1970 Jean Cerf proved the pseudoisotopy theorem which implies that formula_65 is the trivial group provided formula_66, and so formula_67 provided formula_66.

==Applications==
If &quot;M&quot; is a piecewise linear manifold then the problem of finding the compatible smooth structures on &quot;M&quot; depends on knowledge of the groups . More precisely, the obstructions to the existence of any smooth structure lie in the groups for various values of &quot;k&quot;, while if such a smooth structure exists then all such smooth structures can be classified using the groups .
In particular the groups Γ&quot;k&quot; vanish if , so all PL manifolds of dimension at most 7 have a smooth structure, which is essentially unique if the manifold has dimension at most 6.

The following finite abelian groups are essentially the same:
*The group Θ&quot;n&quot; of h-cobordism classes of oriented homotopy &quot;n&quot;-spheres.
*The group of h-cobordism classes of oriented &quot;n&quot;-spheres.
*The group Γ&quot;n&quot; of twisted oriented &quot;n&quot;-spheres.
*The homotopy group &quot;n&quot;(PL/DIFF)
*If , the homotopy group &quot;n&quot;(TOP/DIFF) (if this group has order 2; see Kirby–Siebenmann invariant).
*The group of smooth structures of an oriented PL &quot;n&quot;-sphere.
*If , the group of smooth structures of an oriented topological &quot;n&quot;-sphere.
*If , the group of components of the group of all orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1.

==4-dimensional exotic spheres and Gluck twists==
In 4 dimensions it is not known whether there are any exotic smooth structures on the 4-sphere. The statement that they do not exist is known as the &quot;smooth Poincaré conjecture&quot;, and is discussed by who say that it is believed to be false.

Some candidates proposed for exotic 4-spheres are the Cappell–Shaneson spheres () and those derived by Gluck twists . Gluck twist spheres are constructed by cutting out a tubular neighborhood of a 2-sphere &quot;S&quot; in &quot;S&quot;4 and gluing it back in using a diffeomorphism of its boundary &quot;S&quot;2×&quot;S&quot;1. The result is always homeomorphic to &quot;S&quot;4. Many cases over the years were ruled out as possible counterexamples to the smooth 4 dimensional Poincaré conjecture. For example, , , , , , , , .

<doc id="1114932" wikidata="Q207635" url="?curid=1114932" title="Benishangul-Gumuz Region">
<text>Benishangul-Gumuz () is a regional state in northwestern Ethiopia bordering Sudan. It was previously known as Region 6. The region&#x27;s capital is Assosa. Following the adoption of the 1995 constitution, the region was created from the westernmost portion of the Gojjam province (the part north of the Abay River), and the northwestern portion of the Welega Province (the part south of the Abay). The name of the region comes from two peoples – Berta (also called Benishangul, which is its original name) and Gumuz.

The region has faced major challenges to economic development, due to lack of transportation and communications infrastructure. The Abay River (Blue Nile) divides Benishangul-Gumuz, and there was no bridge crossing it until 2012. The major road that connects the Metekel Zone and the Assosa Zone was built by the China Construction Company in 2012. The road has a 365-meter bridge that crosses the Abay. Nowadays it is simple to travel between the regional capital of Assosa and Gilgil Beles, the capital of the Metekel Zone. Previously one had to travel through Wollega and Gojjam in the neighboring regions of Oromia and Amhara, a distance of 1,250 kilometers, but it is now around 378 kilometers on the new road and bridge. Conditions for travel within zones varies, but is often poor and subject to disruption by the rainy season. On 28 July 2009, the Regional Rural Roads Authority reported that over the previous year almost 600 of the 800 kilometers of local all-weather roads had been upgraded at a cost of 11.5 million birr, and an additional 447 kilometers of roads constructed.

== Demographics ==
Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), the Benishangul-Gumuz Region has a total population of 784,345, consisting of 398,655 men and 385,690 women; urban inhabitants number 105,926 or 13.51% of the population. With an estimated area of 49,289.46 square kilometers, this Region has an estimated density of 15.91 people per square kilometer. For the entire region 174,445 households were counted, which results in an average for the Region of 4.5 persons to a household, with urban households having on average 3.6 and rural households 4.7 people. The ethnic groups include the Berta (25.41%), Amhara (21.69%), Gumuz (20.88%), Oromo (13.55%), Shinasha (7.73%) and Agaw-Awi (4.22%). Main languages are the before;Berta (25.15%), Amharic (22.46%), Gumuz (20.59%), Oromo (17.69%), Shinasha (4.58%) and Awngi (4.01%). Concerning religion, 44.98% of the population were Muslim, 33.3% were Orthodox Christians, 13.53% were Protestant, and 7.09% practiced traditional beliefs. It had a projected population of 1,127,001 in 2018.

In the previous census, conducted in 1994, the region&#x27;s population was reported to be 460,459 of which 233,013 were men and 227,446 were women. Rural population was 424,432, while the urban population was 36,027. The five largest ethnic groups in Benishangul-Gumuz were the Berta (27%), Gumuz (23%), Amhara (22%), Oromo (13%) and Shinasha (7%). Berta is spoken in the Sherkole woreda, Gumuz is spoken along the western boundary of Guba and Dangur woredas and in the Sirba Abbay woreda, and the Shinasha are a displaced people of Kaffa scattered across Welega and Gojjam. The Berta, Gumuz and Shinasha tend to have more in common with the people of neighbouring Sudan than with other Ethiopian peoples, while the Amhara and Tigrayans, who are known as &quot;Habesha&quot; (or &quot;highlanders&quot;) are recent arrivals, who began to settle in the region during the Derg era. According to the 1994 census 44.1% of inhabitants were Muslim, 34.8% Orthodox Christians, 13.1% followers of traditional religions and 5.8% Protestants.

According to the CSA, , 27.23% of the total population had access to safe drinking water, of whom 22.35% were rural inhabitants and 58.53% were urban. Values for other reported common indicators of the standard of living for Benishangul-Gumuz include the following: 19.1% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 47.4% and for women 23.2%; and the regional infant mortality rate is 84 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is greater than the nationwide average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants’ first month of life.

There are 2 refugee camps and 1 transit center, housing 36,440 refugees from Sudan and South Sudan, located in Benishangul-Gumuz region.

===Ethnic groups===
Some of ethnic groups native to the Benishangul-Gumuz region are:
* Berta, mostly in Assosa Zone
* Gumuz, mostly in Kamashi Zone, also form the plurality in Metekel Zone
* Kwama, mostly in Mao-Komo special woreda
* Shinasha, mostly in Metekel Zone
* Amhara people,mostly in Metekel Zone
* Agew people, mostly in Metekel Zone
* Mao, mostly in Mao-Komo special woreda
* Bambashi, mostly in Bambashi (woreda)

Five of these ethnic groups (Benishangul, Gumuz, Shinasha, Mao and Kwama) are granted the exclusive right to non-territorially functioning indigenous councils.

== History ==
Like the Gambela Region, Benishangul-Gumuz is historically closely linked to neighbouring areas of Sudan, and to a lesser extent to the Ethiopian Highlands. These regions served as slave-hunting grounds since Aksumite times, and their Nilosaharan-speaking inhabitants were pejoratively called Shanqella (Šanqəlla, also Shanqila, Shankella) by the highland Ethiopians. Besides slaves, gold was traditionally an important export of Benishangul.

Little is known about its history before the 19th century. Archaeologists have found sites that they date to the end of the 1st millennium BC or the beginning of the 1st millennium AD and assign them to the forerunners of today&#x27;s Komuz-speaking ethnic groups. Finds attributing them to the Berta date from the 17th to 20th centuries and are mainly located on mountains, hills and in rocky areas that are easy to defend. It was not until the mid-20th century that Berta also settled in the lowlands, as slave hunts and armed conflict had ended.

The area lay as a &quot;buffer zone&quot; or &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; between southern Sennar and Damot in the highlands. The Ethiopian Emperor Susenyos invaded the area in 1617/18, and it fell to the Funj Sultanate in 1685.

According to Negasso Gidada, Oromo penetration into the region began in the mid-18th century.

In the first quarter of the 19th century, Arab traders arrived from Sennar, which was occupied by Ottoman Egypt from 1821. These traders married into the Berta upper class and thus gained political influence. By the middle of the century, the &quot;waṭāwiṭ&quot;, the descendants of Arabs and Berta, had become the new ruling class. They also began to spread Islam among the Berta. Various trade routes met in Benishangul, and local gold and Ethiopian &quot;amole&quot; (salt bars) were exchanged for slaves, cattle, horses, iron, civet, musk, coffee, ivory and honey (which also came from the Oromo areas of Sibu and Leeqaa). Luxury goods such as textiles and glass beads were imported via Sudan.

Later in the 19th century, Benishangul was affected by the Mahdi uprising. In the late 19th century, Ethiopia, under Menelik II, annexed the Sultanates of Beni Shangul and Gubba (Qubba in Arabic) at the behest of Abdallahi ibn Muhammad of Sudan who feared the British would occupy it. In 1898, Asosa became the political and economic capital. Until the Italian occupation of Ethiopia in the mid-1930s, the area supplied gold and slaves to the central government on a large scale. Slaves were also smuggled into Sudan across the border, which was established in 1902.

Under the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam, who ruled Ethiopia from 1974, some 250,000 drought and famine-stricken peasants from the highlands—mostly Amharas from Wollo province—were relocated to Benishangul-Gumuz from 1979 and especially in the mid-1980s.

Resistance to the Mengistu regime here came mainly from the Berta. In addition, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) - supported by the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front, which in the meantime had advanced far south from Eritrea - also fought for the area in the Ethiopian civil war in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The OLF tried to incorporate the local population as &quot;black Oromo&quot;, but met with little support. The Berta rebels instead allied with the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF), which overthrew the Mengistu regime in 1991 with the coalition EPRDF. As the Berta People&#x27;s Liberation Movement or Benishangul People&#x27;s Liberation Movement (BPLM), they - like the Gambella People’s Liberation Movement of the Anuak in Gambella - were not accepted as full members of the EPRDF, but became regional partners of the new ruling coalition.

In 2019, the Metekel conflict began. In December 2019, about 200 people were killed in the Metekel massacre.

== Agriculture ==
The CSA of Ethiopia estimated in 2005 that farmers in Benishangul-Gumuz had a total of 307,820 head of cattle (representing 0.79% of Ethiopia&#x27;s total cattle), 65,800 sheep (0.38%), 244,570 goats (1.88%), 1,770 mules (1.2%), 37,520 asses (1.5%), 732,270 poultry of all species (2.37%), and 166,130 beehives (3.82%).

Over 60% of this region is covered with forest, including bamboo, eucalyptus and rubber trees, incense and gum forests as well as the indigenous species. However, due to increased population which has led to the widespread destruction of the canopy, authorities announced a campaign on 8 June 2007 to plant 1.5 million seedlings over the next two months to replenish this resource.

<text>The Évian Accords were a set of peace treaties signed on 18 March 1962 in Évian-les-Bains, France, by France and the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, the government-in-exile of FLN (), which sought Algeria&#x27;s independence from France. The Accords ended the 1954–1962 Algerian War with a formal cease-fire proclaimed for 19 March and formalized the status of Algeria as an independent nation and the idea of cooperative exchanges between the two countries.

==Content of Évian Accords==

The Évian Accords consisted of 93 pages of detailed agreements and arrangements. In essence these covered cease-fire arrangements, prisoner releases, the recognition of full sovereignty and right to self-determination of Algeria, in addition to guarantees of protection, non-discrimination and property rights for all Algerian citizens. A section dealing with military issues provided for the withdrawal of French forces over a period of two years, with the exception of those garrisoning the French military base of Mers El Kébir. Other provisions pledged that there would be no sanctions for any acts committed prior to the ceasefire.

French President Charles de Gaulle wanted to maintain French interests in the area, including industrial and commercial primacy and control over Saharan oil reserves. In addition, the European French community (the &quot;colon&quot; population), the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; and indigenous Sephardi Jews in Algeria were guaranteed religious freedom and property rights as well as French citizenship with the option to choose between French and Algerian citizenship after three years. In exchange, Algeria received access to technical assistance and financial aid from the French government. Algerians were permitted to continue freely circulating between their country and France for work, although they would not have political rights equal to French citizens. The OAS right-wing movement opposed the negotiations through a series of bombings and an assassination attempt against De Gaulle at Clamart in Paris in August 1962.

The agreements included an article which stated that &quot;Algeria concedes to France the use of certain air bases, terrains, sites and military installations which are necessary to it.&quot; The agreement specifically permitted France to maintain its naval base at Mers El Kébir for another fifteen years and facilities for underground nuclear testing in the Sahara; France withdrew from the base in 1967, only five years after the agreement.

==The vote==
In a referendum held on 8 April 1962, the French electorate approved the Accords, with almost 91% in favour. The final result was 17,866,423 in favour of Algerian independence, and 1,809,074 against.

On 1 July, the Accords were subject to a second referendum in Algeria, where with 5,975,581 voted for independence and just 16,534 against. De Gaulle pronounced Algeria an independent country on 3 July.

==The negotiators==
==Outcome of Agreements==
The historian Alistair Horne comments that most provisions of the agreements were to be overtaken by events. The wholesale exodus of almost all of the million-strong European community immediately prior to independence made the three year transition clauses a dead letter, while the widespread killings of Muslims who had served as auxiliaries (harkis) with the French Army was in direct contravention of the amnesty provisions of the treaty.

<text>:&quot;In the Vietnamese name below,&quot; Nguyễn &quot;is the surname.&quot;

Nguyễn Phúc Bảo Long, Crown Prince of Vietnam (阮福保隆, 4 January 1936 – 28 July 2007) was the eldest son of Bảo Đại and Queen Nam Phương. He was the last crown prince of the Nguyễn dynasty in Vietnamese history. He had one younger brother, Bảo Thăng, and three younger sisters, Phuong Mai, Phuong Lien and Phuong Dung, all of whom live in France.

==Biography==
Bảo Long was born at Kien-Trung Palace, Huế on 4 January 1936, to Emperor Bảo Đại and his first wife, Empress Nam Phương. On 7 March 1939, he was invested and proclaimed Crown Prince, the official heir to the throne, in a Confucian ceremony at Can-Chanh Palace in Huế.

In 1947, Empress Nam Phuong left Vietnam with the crown prince and his siblings. They lived at the Château Thorenc outside Cannes, France, and he grew up as a member of the Catholic Church.

===Education===
He received his education at the École des Roches boarding school at Maslacq, then at Clères, Normandy. He then went to Paris and studied law and political science to prepare him to serve on state affairs.

In 1953, Crown Prince Bảo Long attended the coronation of Elizabeth II in London, as a representative of the Vietnamese Imperial Family.

===Military service===
Crown Prince Bảo Long served in the French Foreign Legion in the Algerian War and he highly distinguished himself, earning the Croix de Guerre (Cross of Military Valor) with three stars for his courage in battle. His other decorations are the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit, the decoration of the Golden Gong 2nd Class, the Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Cambodia, the Order of the Million Elephants and the White Parasol of Laos and the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. After 10 years of service in the French Foreign Legion, he returned to Paris, France, where he worked in a bank. He spent the remainder of his life as an investment banker.

=== Head of the Imperial House === 

In 1997, when the Emperor Bảo Đại died, Bảo Long inherited the position of head of the House of Nguyễn Phúc. He remained out of politics and lived quietly in Paris. 

Following the death of Bảo Đại, Bảo Long allegedly sold the sword that was handed over in the 1945 abdication ceremony.

During his time as head of the house, Bảo Long worked with Prince Bảo Vàng, who was appointed Grandmaster of the Imperial Order of the Dragon of Annam in 2005. The focus of the order is on humanitarian, educational, and cultural endeavours of the people of Vietnam.

Although the Vietnamese Constitutional Monarchist League wish to restore the Nguyễn dynasty to the throne under a constitutional monarchy, as in Cambodia and Thailand, Bảo Long did not support their political aspirations.

Crown Prince Bao Long died at the Le Centre Hospitalier Gaston Ramon, Sens, Burgundy on 28 July 2007, with his brother, Bảo Thăng, succeeding him as head of the house.

==Personal life==
From the late 1960s until the early 1970s, Bảo Long was the companion of Isabelle Hebey (died 1996), an interior designer, who worked on his Paris residence. Though they planned to wed in June 1969, after Hebey&#x27;s divorce from architect Marc Delanne, the marriage did not take place.

<text>The Gambela Region, also spelled Gambella, and officially the Gambela Peoples&#x27; Region (), is a regional state in western Ethiopia. Previously known as Region 12, its capital and largest city is Gambela. It is bordered by the Oromia Region to the east, the South West Ethiopia Region to the south, and the country of South Sudan to the west. 

Gambela is situated between the Baro and Akobo Rivers, with its western part including the Openo River. It covers an area of approximately 29,783 square kilometers with a population of 525,000 inhabitants, making it one of Ethiopia&#x27;s smallest regions and one of its least populous. Gambela is home to a diverse population which includes the Anuak, Nuer, and other indigenous groups collectively referred to as the Majang Komo and Opo. 

== Demographics ==
Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), the Gambela region has total population of 307,096, consisting of 159,787 men and 147,309 women; urban inhabitants number 77,925 or 25.37% of the population. With an estimated area of 29,782.82 square kilometers, this region has an estimated density of 10 people per square kilometer. For the entire region, 66,467 households were counted, which results in an average for the region of 4.6 persons to household, with urban &quot;households&quot; having on average 3.8 and rural households 4.9 people. Various Nilotic ethnic minority groups mainly inhabit the Gambela region: Anuak (Anywaa), Nuer,Majang and others.

In 1994, the national census reported the region&#x27;s population to be 181,862 in 35,940 households, of whom 92,902 were men and 88,960 women; 27,424 or 15.08% were urban inhabitants. (This total also includes an estimate for all 19 kebeles of one woreda and six kebeles in two other woredas, which were not counted; these areas were estimated to have 19,465 inhabitants, of whom 9,203 were men and 10,262 women.) The six largest ethnic groups of the region were Anuak (Anywaa), Nuer, Amhara, Oromo, Majang, Komo and other ethnic groups. Languages spoken are Anuak, Nuer,Amharic, Afaan Oromo, Majang; the remaining spoke all other primary languages reported. The projected population for 2017 was 435,999.

Values for reported common indicators of the standard of living for Nuer include the following: 44% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 57.5% and for women 22.8%; and the regional infant mortality rate is 92 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is greater than the nationwide average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants’ first month of life.

===Religion===
90% of the region&#x27;s population are Protestants, 5% Orthodox, 3% Muslim, 1% practice traditional religions, and 1% are Catholic.

==Refugee camps==
There are a number of refugee camps located in Gambela region housing around 268,000 refugees from South Sudan in August 2016:
From August 2016 to August 2018, the numbers increased from 268,000 to 402,000 refugees, almost equaling the native population of Gambela Region.

== Economy ==
The CSA reported that for 2004-2005 3,734 tons of coffee were produced in Gambela, based on inspection records from the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea authority. This represents 1.64% of the total production in Ethiopia. The CSA could not provide livestock estimates for Gambela. In a 26 May 2000 report, the FAO observed that at the time trypanosomiasis was a major problem in cattle for this region. There had been an epidemic of this disease in the area during 1970.

Gambela is believed to have major oil resources. In June 2003, the Ethiopian government signed an agreement with Petronas of Malaysia for the joint exploration and development of oil resources in Gambella region. Petronas then awarded a contract for seismic data acquisition to China&#x27;s Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau (ZPEB) in October of that year.

The Water and Mines Resources Development Bureau of Gambela announced January 2007 that it was initiating a program that would drill 13 new manually operated wells, 54 new deep water wells, and develop four springs. This would provide access to drinking water for 26,000 inhabitants, increasing coverage for the state to 42 percent from the existing 27 percent, at a cost of 6 million Birr. Construction of an asphalt road 102 kilometers in length and connecting Gambela City with Jikawo by way of Itang was begun in 2008 with a budget over 446 million Birr.

As of 2015, Indian investors have acquired 6,000 square km of land in the Gambela region, following other investors, for agricultural land from the central government. This has led to conflict with regional government officials and local communities. Not all the land is actually being farmed, as per the agreement, and there are accusations of investors illegally clearing trees in the Gambella National Park in a blog.

== Administrative subdivisions ==

While Gambela is subdivided into administrative zones and woredas as other regions in Ethiopia are, this region has seen the most changes in these subdivisions of any region, to the point they can confuse anyone tracing their development. Originally, Gambela was subdivided into four administrative zones without proper names (1, 2, 3 and 4) and one special woreda (Godere special woreda). By 2001, when the CSA released its &quot;Sample Agricultural Enumeration&quot;, these four zones had been combined into two, and Godere had been merged into the second administrative zone.

By the 2007 census, Gambela had been redivided into three zones (named for the three largest ethnic groups), and the area around Itang town had been made a special woreda; borders of existing woredas were moved around to create several new ones within the zones. These zones are:

* Anywaa Zone
* Majang Zone
* Nuer Zone
* Itang

The Anywaa Zone is by far the largest of the zones of Gambela region and also includes the capital, Gambela. The terrain is mostly flat at elevations between 400 – 550 meters above sea level but with the eastern fringes of Anywaa Zone and in particular the easternmost zone, Majang, being partly in the highlands and rising to an elevation of ~2000 meters near the eastern border.

== Towns ==
There are 12 towns in the Gambela Region.

<text>The LinuxTV project is an informal group of volunteers who develop software regarding digital television for the Linux kernel-based operating systems. The community develops and maintains the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) driver subsystem which is part of the Linux kernel since version 2.6.x. The Linux kernel and the LinuxTV CVS include a fair number of drivers for commonly available PCI cards and USB devices, but the DVB subsystem core is also targeted towards set-top boxes which run some (embedded) Linux.

The LinuxTV project was originally initiated by the Berlin, Germany based company Convergence Integrated Media GmbH with the goal to distribute free and open source software for the production, distribution and reception of digital television. In 1998, the Convergence founders claimed that &quot;Only the access to the source code of our future television sets will guarantee the independence of content and technology&quot;.

After some financial troubles, in 2002 Convergence had been taken over by the German set top box manufacturer Galaxis AG, and renamed to Convergence GmbH. Although both Convergence GmbH and Galaxis AG went bankrupt in 2005, the LinuxTV project lives on independently, being supported by the large developer community that had gathered around the project over the years. 

Another significant Convergence development is DirectFB, a thin library that provides hardware graphics acceleration and windowing features for GTK+-based and other graphical Linux applications without the use of X.Org Server, and which its developers claim &quot;adds graphical power to embedded systems&quot;.

<doc id="1114948" wikidata="Q1977242" url="?curid=1114948" title="Paul Teutul Jr.">
<text>Paul Michael Teutul (born October 2, 1974) is one of the stars of the American reality television series &quot;American Chopper&quot;, also starring his father (Paul John Teutul). Teutul was the chief designer and fabricator. Prior to this, he was head of the rail shop at Orange County Ironworks. He is the founder of Paul Jr. Designs, which manufactures custom motorcycles and sells branded clothing.
Teutul, along with his father and younger brother Michael, became celebrities when they became the focus of a reality television series &quot;American Chopper&quot; on Discovery Channel in 2002.

==Early life==
The oldest of four children, Teutul Jr. has two younger brothers: Daniel, the owner/general manager of Orange County Ironworks LLC, and Michael who featured on the television shows. The youngest of the Teutul children is sister Cristin, who currently works as a nurse in Rochester, New York. Paul&#x27;s mother is Paula Teutul, his father&#x27;s first wife.

==Falling out==
On the April 9, 2009 episode of &quot;American Chopper&quot;, following a disagreement with his father and business partner, Teutul&#x27;s employment was terminated. They attempted to resolve their disagreements, and he returned to work for OCC. The April 30, 2009 episode reveals that Teutul ultimately decided to voluntarily terminate his employment as a full-time member of the staff. In subsequent episodes, Teutul returned to OCC as a consultant, helping with bike builds when his father was away from the shop, and on motorbike builds needing additional manpower.

==Paul Jr. Designs==

Teutul opened his own design firm Paul Jr. Designs, and, in 2009, designed a dog park in Montgomery, New York. His first product design was a &quot;facelift&quot; for Coleman&#x27;s 10th anniversary &quot;Roadtrip Grill&quot; in 2010. On the February 4, 2010 &quot;American Chopper&quot; episode &quot;Stewart-Haas Bike&quot;, Teutul pitched a line of dog toys to Bamboo Pets.

It was reported in mid April 2010 by TMZ, that Teutul planned to start his own motorcycle business to go head-to-head against OCC. The report states that Teutul is bringing on several former OCC employees, including Michael Teutul, Vinnie DiMartino, Joe Puliafico, and Robert &quot;Nub&quot; Collard. After waiting out a one-year non-compete clause with Orange County Choppers, Teutul began building motorcycles at PJD, which is featured on a new series, &quot;American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior&quot;, on the Discovery Channel. The company now competes directly with OCC. Former OCC employee Cody Connelly has since joined PJD. In 2014, PJD assembled two teams to create two &quot;Azeroth Choppers&quot; for Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; which appeared in the game. In 2016, PJD created two bikes for the feature film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;.

== Lawsuit ==

=== Bankruptcy fraud ===
Paul John, Paul Michael and his brother Daniel were named in a 2007 lawsuit alleging fraudulent transfer, brought on behalf of Turner Construction. This dates back to 2003 and a ruling in favor of Turner in 2005 concerning the original OC Iron Works company. It was alleged that assets were stripped from the OC Ironworks, transferring the viable assets, contracts and personnel to a new company OC Ironworks LLC, before bankrupting the former. This involved transferring the ownership to Paul Jr. and allegedly selling the assets to the new company with unfair compensation. Trustee Tom Genova filed fraud complaints in 2007 with the Bankruptcy Court and in complaint sought to have the transfers from the old company to the new company judged fraudulent and set aside. He also sought to make the new company liable for the old company&#x27;s debts. A proposed settlement was reached with Orange County LLC paying out $500,000 to Genova to be distributed to the creditors.

=== &quot;Teutul v Teutul&quot;===
On February 16, 2011, the New York State Unified Court System&#x27;s website, showed that the &quot;Teutul v Teutul&quot; civil action was no longer active. The case had been &quot;Disposed&quot;, meaning the case was out of the court system. On the August 29, 2011 episode, Teutul Jr. and Teutul Sr. settled the lawsuit with Teutul Sr.&#x27;s purchase of Teutul Jr.&#x27;s 20% share in Orange County Choppers (OCC), thus ending the lawsuit.

==Personal life==
On August 20, 2010, Teutul Jr. married Rachael Biester. They were on the TLC show &quot;Say Yes to the Dress&quot;. On February 3, 2015, his wife gave birth to their son, Hudson Seven Teutul.

<text>Etchilhampton is a small village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, in the Vale of Pewsey east of Devizes.

== History ==
The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a settlement of 28 households, held by Edward of Salisbury. The manor came into the Malwain family by 1195, and in 1489 passed to the Wiltshire branch of the Ernle family, whose descendants included Sir Edward Ernle (c.1673-1729), a Member of Parliament. The land continued to pass by inheritance until it was sold in 1928.

The village had an alternative name of Ashlington, which was in common use until the 19th century. The village grew along both sides of a street, with the church near the middle; after houses in the central section fell into disuse, by 1885 that part of the street had been reduced to a footpath, and today the village continues as two distinct settlements.

Manor Farmhouse, a Grade II* listed two-storey timber framed building, is from the early 16th century. Etchilhampton House, built in 1773, is a Grade II listed two-storey three-bay house in brick and stone.

Etchilhampton stood on the Devizes-Upavon road until, in 1768, a new road (now the A342) was built on the southern slope of Etchilhampton Hill, avoiding the steep gradients of the earlier route. A few years later a monument – a stone plinth bearing a seated lion – was erected by the turning for Etchilhampton in memory of James Long of Wedhampton, who had promoted the new road.

A school was built in the centre of the village in 1831, and rebuilt in 1875. Children of all ages attended until 1929, when older pupils were transferred to Devizes. The school closed in 1970 owing to low numbers of pupils.

The population of the parish peaked in the mid 19th century, with 282 recorded at the 1841 census. Numbers fell to 170 by 1881 and have continued at or below that level.

== Parish church ==
The Church of England parish church of St Andrew dates from the 14th century and has a late 12th century font; other furnishings include 17th century box pews. The chancel was rebuilt in the 1860s.

The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1962. It has always been a chapelry of All Saints&#x27; Church at All Cannings; today it is served by the Cannings and Redhorn team ministry, which covers a large area of the Vale of Pewsey.

==Local government==
Etchilhampton is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most significant local government functions.

<text>Andrey Sergeyevich Yepishin (, born 10 June 1981 in Zhukovsky) is a Russian athlete specializing in the 100 metres.

== Career ==
He won a silver medal in 4 x 100 metres relay at the 2003 Summer Universiade. Participating in the 2004 Summer Olympics, he achieved fifth place in his 100 metres heat, thus failing to make it through to the second round. He also participated on the Russian relay team, which finished last. The next year Yepishin finished fifth at the European Indoor Championships, and won a silver medal at the Universiade in İzmir.

In 2006 he finished second in the 60 metres at the World Indoor Championships in Moscow to clock a new personal best and national record time of 6.52 seconds. He won the silver medal in the 100 m at the 2006 European Athletics Championships and recorded a new national record of 10.10 seconds.

He finished seventh at the 2006 IAAF World Cup, and eighth at the 2008 World Indoor Championships. At the 2008 Olympic Games he placed 2nd in his heat after Derrick Atkins in a time of 10.34 seconds. He qualified for the second round in which he improved his time to 10.25 seconds. However, he was unable to qualify for the semi-finals as he finished in 6th place of his heat.

<doc id="1114966" wikidata="Q16953927" url="?curid=1114966" title="British Hill Climb Championship">
<text>The British Hillclimb Championship (BHC) is the most prestigious hillclimbing championship in Great Britain. The British Hill Climb Championship was held every year from 1947 to 2019, and resumed in 2021. The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

All British Champions have been British. The most successful driver in terms of individual victories is Scott Moran, with 163, followed by Martin Groves (104) and Roy Lane (91). Moran and Tony Marsh jointly hold the record for the most championships, with six apiece. Ken Wharton is the only driver to win four consecutive titles, while Marsh uniquely scored two hat-tricks in 1955-1957 and 1965–1967.

==Venues==
The following tracks are used in the British Hill Climb Championship. 

* Doune
* Gurston Down
* Harewood
* Loton Park
* Prescott
* Shelsley Walsh
* Wiscombe Park
* Bouley Bay
* Craigantlet
* Val des Terres

A number of other venues have featured in the championship over the years including Barbon, Bo&#x27;ness, Dyrham Park, Fintray, Great Auclum, Lhergy Frissel, Longleat, Pontypool Park, Rest and Be Thankful, Stapleford Aerodrome, Tholt-y-Will and Westbrook Hay.

==Format==

A major hillclimb may have an entry of more than 150 drivers, but the event is usually a qualifying round of more than one competition, and some drivers (especially drivers of less powerful cars) will not be entered for the British Championship itself. Those who are, and who record a time in the top twelve of all those eligible, compete in a &quot;run-off&quot; at the end of each set of class run (there are two such sets of class runs at each event). In a run-off, drivers tackle the hill in reverse order of their qualifying times, although where two drivers share a car, the slower qualifier competes at the start of the run-off session. The person who sets the fastest time receives 10 British Championship points, the second-fastest driver nine, and so on down to the tenth-placed driver, who gets one. The 11th and 12th-placed drivers, and any who fail to complete the course, receive no points. An extra point is given to any driver in the run-off who breaks the outright hill record &quot;as it stood at the beginning of the day&quot;.

As of 2022 there are 30 runoffs, but drivers can only count their 24 best results towards their final points total. In 2004, Adam Fleetwood achieved the unprecedented feat of winning 28 out of 34 rounds, and so had to drop all his non-win points. Even so, he won the championship by a huge margin: before taking account of his dropped scores, he had racked up 318 points, with the runner-up, 1997 champion Roger Moran, a long way behind on 176 points.

==History==
===The early days===
The first climb of the inaugural series was staged at Bo&#x27;ness, near Linlithgow, Scotland on 17 May 1947. It was one of five events in that year&#x27;s championship, the other climbs being held at Bouley Bay, Craigantlet, Prescott and Shelsley Walsh. All but Bo&#x27;ness still host rounds of the BHC. The inaugural championship, as well as the 1948 title, went to Raymond Mays, who proved he was still the force to be reckoned with that he had been before World War II. Sydney Allard won the title in 1949 in the self-built Steyr-Allard.

===The 1950s===
Although the 1950 championship went to Alfa Romeo driver Dennis Poore, from then on every title of the decade was to be won by a driver who had spent most or all of the year behind the wheel of a Cooper with a JAP engine. Ken Wharton started the trend, and became the only man to win four successive BHC titles. In the mid-Fifties there were three successive titles for the near-legendary Tony Marsh, a man who would still be competing at the highest level of hillclimbing as the 20th century closed. And finally, another hat-trick of championships went to David Boshier-Jones.

The decade was also touched by tragedy, when Bill Sleeman was killed at Bouley Bay, Jersey in 1955.

The final round of the decade was held at Stapleford Aerodrome on 11 October 1959, an event won by David Good in a Cooper-J.A.P. 1,100 c.c.

===The 1960s===
Although the 1960s opened as the Fifties had ended, with Boshier-Jones taking the honours in his Cooper-JAP, the decade was to see a marked change in hillclimbing. One notable feature of 1960s climbing was the appearance of four-wheel drive, with several of the decade&#x27;s championships being won by drivers in such cars, including two for Peter Westbury.

Mike Gray became the second driver to be killed at a BHC round when he died at Barbon in 1964.

===The 1970s===
The Seventies saw two notable firsts: Roy Lane&#x27;s maiden championship in 1975, and the first of 18 titles in the space of 22 years for Pilbeam drivers when Alister Douglas-Osborn took the honours in 1977.

===The 1980s===
This decade also saw the first championship to be won by a Gould driver, when Chris Cramer took the title in 1985. However, it was to be the late 1990s before the Pilbeam near-stranglehold on the BHC would be broken for any length of time.

===The 1990s===
The 1990s continued and even intensified Pilbeam&#x27;s dominance of the sport, with the first eight championships of the decade being won by a driver in one of the marque&#x27;s cars. By the time Roger Moran clinched the title in 1997, Pilbeam drivers had won 18 of the 22 championships since 1977, a dominance rivalled only by the Cooper years of the 1950s and early 1960s.

However, change was afoot, and the 1998 championship went to a Gould driver, David Grace. The future CEO of Rockingham Motor Speedway stamped his authority on the championship with a hat-trick of titles as the 20th century closed. As of 2004, every champion since had been behind the wheel of a Gould.

The hillclimb world was shocked in 1995 by the death of one of its leading lights, when Mark Colton was killed in practice at Craigantlet. He thus became only the third driver to lose his life in the history of the BHC.

===A new century===

The start of the 21st century saw a &quot;changing of the guard&quot; in the BHC, as young drivers in lightweight cars made their presence felt at the highest level. Graeme Wight Jr dominated in 2001, and in June he broke the outright record at Shelsley Walsh that had stood for nine years. Almost a year later he became the first driver to break the 25-second barrier at the track, winning a prize of £1,000.

The 2001 season was severely disrupted by the foot and mouth crisis that year, which caused the postponement of some rounds of the series, though only one climb - at Barbon - was actually cancelled entirely, and co-operation between event organisers and local landowners meant that spectators continued to be admitted to the meetings, albeit with precautions such as the disinfecting of cars entering the car parks.

A little later in the decade, once Adam Fleetwood had proved that he could translate his exploits in smaller cars to the top class, Wight Jr began to come under intense pressure, and by 2004 Fleetwood usually had the better of their battles. That season&#x27;s championship was robbed of a classic battle for the title when Wight Jr pulled out in June to wait for the arrival of a new car - this had still not been driven in anger by the end of the year. However, crowds around the country could console themselves by watching a true master of the hills at work. Fleetwood won all but six of the year&#x27;s 34 BHC rounds, breaking hill records for fun - and in turn became the first person to climb Shelsley in under &quot;24&quot; seconds.

Fleetwood&#x27;s announcement in April 2005 that other commitments would prevent his defending his title meant once again that the two most successful drivers of the 2000s would not go head-to-head, and the stage seemed set for Wight Jr to regain his crown, although his new V10 Predator proved unreliable, allowing the impressive Martin Groves to open up a lead at the top of the points table; Groves had the championship wrapped up by early August. With Wight Jr still nowhere to be seen, Groves retained the title in 2006, although he had to wait a month longer than in the previous year thanks to a spirited challenge from Scott Moran. Groves again held off Moran&#x27;s charge in 2007 to complete a hat-trick of titles, but in 2008 Moran took his first championship win, retaining his title in 2009.

Moran has since won a further five titles, and his Gould GR61X (by far the most successful car in the history of the championship, with over 170 run-off wins) has won a total of seven. After several seasons in a supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa-engined DJ Firehawk, Alex Summers co-drove the GR61X with Moran and became champion in it at his first attempt.

Pirelli developed a new tyre for British hillclimbing in 2019, giving Avon its first rival in the 21st century. This forced Avon to respond by introducing its new Hillclimb GT Super Soft Compound tyre on 4 June 2020. Several drivers made the switch, including that year&#x27;s Champion Wallace Menzies. Driving a Gould GR59 with a 3.3-litre V8 engine derived from the Cosworth XD, Menzies made it mathematically impossible for anyone to catch him after Round 27 (of 34) at Gurston Down on 25 August 2019. He became only the second Scottish driver to win the title after Graeme Wight Jr.

Since 1998, the only non-Gould driver to win the championship has been Trevor Willis, who did so in 2012 with his OMS 25, a less powerful but lighter car with a V8 engine derived from two Hayabusa units, and again in 2017 and 2018 with a similar but updated OMS 28.

===2020 cancellation===

Restrictions brought into force during the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to run events in the early part of 2020. Attempts were then made to organise a &#x27;foreshortened&#x27; championship with rounds at five venues held over seven weekends starting in August. On 12 June, however, the Bugatti Owners&#x27; Club announced that, while it intended to reintroduce events at Prescott, it would not host a British championship event that season. This prompted the cancellation of the 2020 championship and an announcement that the organisers would now focus on the 2021 season.

==2021 season==
The 2021 British Hillclimb Championship presented by Avon Tyres was won by 2019 (and reigning) Champion Wallace Menzies.

<text>Michael Joseph Teutul (born November 26, 1978) is an American television personality who appeared on the reality programs &quot;Orange County Choppers&quot; &quot;American Chopper&quot; and &quot;American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior&quot;.

== Early life ==
He is the youngest son of Paul Teutul Sr., the founder of Orange County Choppers, and his first wife, Paula Teutul. He is the younger brother of Paul Teutul Jr., the chief fabricator on the show, and Daniel Teutul, the owner/general manager of Orange County Ironworks LLC.

At age 14, Teutul began working at his family&#x27;s company, the Orange County Iron Works. 

== Career ==
After Paul Sr. and Paul Jr. started Orange County Choppers, Teutul joined them as an assistant general manager. His duties involved answering phones and taking out the trash. On rare occasions, Teutul would help build choppers, at one point building his own bike. The family business became the basis for the &quot;American Chopper&quot; series. 

Teutul&#x27;s role as part of the TV shows was to provide comic relief. Teutul frequently appeared at promotional events for the company. Teutul appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. 

In December 2009 it was revealed on &quot;American Chopper&quot; that Michael Teutul had checked himself into a rehabilitation center to overcome an alcohol addiction.

Toward the end of the series, Teutul tried to mediate the ongoing disputes between Paul Sr. and Paul Jr. As revealed in season 6 episode 13, Michael was forced out of the business. Paul Sr. stated that Michael had many opportunities to be successful at OCC but never followed through on them. Michael joined Paul Jr. in his new business venture, &quot;Paul Jr. Designs&quot;.

Teutul&#x27;s hobbies include painting and skeet shooting. In 2011 Teutul was attempting to market a line of gourmet pasta sauces under the moniker &quot;FarQueue Products, LLC&quot;. That same year he opened an art gallery titled Mikey Teutul&#x27;s Wolfgang Gallery which closed in June 2013 due to declining sales.

<doc id="1114977" wikidata="Q1742060" url="?curid=1114977" title="King O'Malley">
<text>King O&#x27;Malley (2 July 1858 not confirmed – 20 December 1953) was an American-born Australian politician who served in the House of Representatives from 1901 to 1917, and served two terms as Minister for Home Affairs (1910–1913; 1915–16). He is remembered for his role in the development of the national capital Canberra as well as his advocacy for the creation of a national bank.

O&#x27;Malley was of American origin and arrived in Australia in 1888. He worked as an insurance salesman before entering politics, in both professions making use of his knack for oratory and publicity stunts. He served a single term in the South Australian House of Assembly (1896–1899), before moving to Tasmania and winning election to the House of Representatives at the inaugural 1901 federal election. O&#x27;Malley was a political radical, and joined the Labor Party (ALP) upon its creation, despite his status as one of the wealthiest members of parliament. He was a keen proponent of banking reform, especially the creation of a national bank, and successfully lobbied for its inclusion in the Labor platform. He was dissatisfied with the initial form of the Commonwealth Bank, but later proclaimed himself as its &quot;father&quot;. However, the amount of credit he deserves for its creation has been debated.

After Labor won the 1910 federal election, O&#x27;Malley was elected to cabinet by the Labor caucus, over the objections of Prime Minister Andrew Fisher. As home affairs minister, he oversaw the start of construction of the Trans-Australian Railway and the early development of the new national capital, including the design competition won by Walter Burley Griffin. A temperance advocate, he banned the sale of alcohol in the Australian Capital Territory. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s second term as home affairs minister was troublesome, marked by conflict with Prime Minister Billy Hughes, among others. O&#x27;Malley remained loyal to the ALP during the 1916 party split, but lost his seat at the 1917 election.

O&#x27;Malley spent his retirement defending his legacy. His political views combined with his personal background and personality traits made him a controversial figure during his career, and his life has continued to attract public interest. On his death, he was the last surviving member of the first Australian federal parliament.

==Early life==
===Birth and parentage===
Uncertainty exists about the details of O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s birth and upbringing, largely due to the inconsistent accounts he provided throughout his life. He was probably born on 2 July 1858 in the U.S. Territory of Kansas. Numerous sources during his lifetime recorded his year of birth as 1858 but, after about 1940, he began to exaggerate his age, claiming a birth year of 1854. At some point, he also began to celebrate his birthday on 4 July, coinciding with Independence Day in the United States. His private diaries record that, until 1947, he personally celebrated his birthday on 2 July, but then apparently shifted the date by two days to emphasize his American origins. As a result, O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s obituaries listed his date of birth as 4 July 1854.

During his political career, O&#x27;Malley claimed to have been born in Quebec, at a location called &quot;Stanford Farm&quot;, close to the U.S. border. He said that no birth certificate existed, because the registration of births was not yet standard in frontier regions. That account of his birth differed from those he related at other periods of his life. In an 1893 letter to the editor of the &quot;Adelaide Advertiser&quot;, he proclaimed himself &quot;a humble sovereign citizen of that supreme nation, the United States&quot;. Towards the end of his life he wrote, &quot;I am an American [...] that is the truth&quot;. O’Malley&#x27;s place of birth had implications for his status as a member of parliament. If he was born in Canada, as he claimed, he was a British subject and faced no eligibility restrictions. If he was born in the United States, his election to federal parliament was in violation of section 44(i) of the constitution. Similar provisions applied in South Australia and Tasmania, where he also ran for parliament. O’Malley&#x27;s claim of Canadian birth was received with scepticism during his lifetime, and has generally been regarded as unreliable. Although he was unable to provide any proof beyond a sworn affidavit, political opponents were also unable to prove conclusively that he was born an American.

On his 1910 marriage certificate, O’Malley listed his parents as Ellen (née King) and William O’Malley, and his father&#x27;s occupation as rancher. His unusual given name was supposedly taken from his mother&#x27;s family name, a common practice in the United States. His parents’ identities have not been corroborated, and other information that he gave on the certificate was of dubious accuracy. In 1913, O’Malley stated that his father was born in Ballymena, in the north of Ireland. The following year, he said that his parents were British subjects born in the United Kingdom, which included Ireland at the time. However, in old age he referred to his “American-born parents”. O&#x27;Malley claimed to have a brother and sister, and apparently stayed with his brother Walter in the small community of Kelly, Kansas, when he returned to the U.S. in 1917.

===Childhood===
O&#x27;Malley grew up in Kansas, possibly in Pawnee County. O&#x27;Malley probably had little formal education, and his writing was &quot;usually deficient in style, grammar and spelling&quot;. According to O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s own account, his father was killed in the American Civil War when he was a young boy and he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Edward and Caroline O&#x27;Malley, in New York City, where his uncle ran a small bank near Wall Street. O&#x27;Malley began working at the bank at the age of 14. He was promoted to teller at 16 and was handling loans by 19. After a disagreement with his uncle, he left the bank at the age of 22 and took a job selling insurance. regards the basic facts of O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s account to be accurate, because he had a detailed knowledge of American banking practices and of New York City. However, he expresses doubt over the details. describes it as &quot;at least partially true&quot;, although she notes &quot;there is no evidence to suggest that he ever lived in New York&quot;.

==Adult life in the United States==
Before he moved to Australia, O&#x27;Malley lived a transient lifestyle on the west coast of the United States, as an insurance salesman and real estate agent. There are contemporary references to him in California, Oregon, and Washington Territory, as well as in his presumptive home state of Kansas. At various times, O&#x27;Malley sold policies for the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, the Home Life Insurance Company of New York, and the Equitable Life Insurance Company. In April 1887, the &quot;Chicago Inter Ocean&quot; reported that he had forwarded policies amounting to $200,000 from Oregon, an immense sum at the time. He may have also made money engaging in land speculation, because he was wealthy enough to invest in property in Seattle, which he retained for several decades. Surviving records indicate that he had &quot;somewhat dubious&quot; business practices – in 1887, he made a series of large deposits at a bank in Corvallis, Oregon, then abruptly withdrew his entire account.

As a young man, O&#x27;Malley became a devotee of the Temperance movement. In 1881, his apparent home state of Kansas became one of the first to enact statewide prohibition. He gave fiery public speeches in the towns where he sold insurance, warning against the dangers of what he called &quot;stagger juice&quot;. O&#x27;Malley supported the pro-temperance Republican Party and, in 1884, stumped for the unsuccessful campaign by James Blaine to become the Republican presidential candidate. O&#x27;Malley later claimed that, if Blaine had been elected president, he would have been appointed ambassador to Chile.

While in Texas, O&#x27;Malley founded a church, taking the title of &quot;First Bishop of the Waterlily Rock Bound Church, the Red Skin Temple of the Cayuse Nation&quot;, in order to take advantage of a government land grant then being offered to churches. In 1881, O&#x27;Malley married Rosy Wilmot, who died from tuberculosis shortly before she was due to give birth in 1886. O&#x27;Malley claimed he had contracted the disease from her, and in 1888, having been given six months to live, he sailed for Queensland, Australia.

==Move to Australia==
In April 1888, the &quot;Oregon City Courier&quot; published an article entitled &quot;King O’Malley Exposed&quot;. The newspaper reported that O&#x27;Malley and a partner had &quot;placed policies to the amount of tens of thousands of dollars by misrepresentation&quot;, and that the Home Life Insurance Company was actively warning customers not to take any money from him. O&#x27;Malley left for Australia a few months later, arriving in Sydney in late July 1888. He travelled from San Francisco, via Hawaii, aboard the SS &quot;Mariposa&quot;. He then went south to attend the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, and his photograph appears in the exhibition&#x27;s official albums, in which he is listed as a representative of an American glass manufacturer.

O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s own version of his arrival in Australia was that he moved there for health reasons, because he was suffering from tuberculosis. He supposedly arrived in the country at Port Alma, Queensland, then took up residence in a cave at Emu Park, where an Aboriginal man named Coowonga nursed him back to health. He subsequently walked overland to Sydney and Melbourne before eventually reaching Adelaide. Of that account, states: &quot;whatever its merits as a story, it has absolutely none as a statement of fact&quot;, and that O&#x27;Malley fabricated a dramatic arrival story to hide the fact that he left the United States to escape embezzlement allegations. Documentary evidence places him in Sydney and Melbourne in 1888, so it would have required a rapid recovery from tuberculosis, followed by a walking journey of hundreds of kilometres, all within a time span of several months.

==South Australia==
By May 1893, O&#x27;Malley was living in Adelaide, South Australia. During that year&#x27;s banking crisis, the &quot;South Australian Register&quot; published a number of letters from him on financial matters. He continued to sell life insurance, excelling at self-promotion. In April 1894, as a publicity stunt, he announced his candidacy for a by-election in the seat of East Torrens, but never formally nominated.

In January 1896, the &quot;Register&quot; reported that O&#x27;Malley would be a candidate for the seat of Encounter Bay at the upcoming general election. Encounter Bay was a rural seat electing two MPs to the House of Assembly. Although not a resident of the electorate, O&#x27;Malley was &quot;apparently a frequent visitor to the area [...] popular with various people in Goolwa and Victor Harbor&quot;. He stood as an independent, surprising observers by topping the poll ahead of William Carpenter of the United Labor Party (ULP), sitting MP Henry Downer of the Australasian National League, and former MP Charles Hussey. O&#x27;Malley enjoyed strong support among the newly enfranchised female voters, who were sympathetic to his pro-temperance views.

At the opening of parliament in June 1896, O&#x27;Malley and seven others refused to take an oath of office and were refused their seats. They were eventually allowed to make affirmations and take their place. After his election,O&#x27;Malley took up residence in a coffee palace on Hindley Street, Adelaide, although he made frequent visits to his electorate. In Parliament, he concentrated on social matters, starting with a proposal to regulate barmaids, the use of which he regarded as a social evil, but his attempt to amend a government liquor licensing bill to that end was unsuccessful. O&#x27;Malley next introduced a bill requiring seats to be provided for shop assistants, which also failed, followed by a successful motion calling for train carriages to be provided with lavatories and better lighting. A private member&#x27;s bill he introduced in 1897 eventually passed as the &quot;Legitimation Act 1898&quot;, allowing for the legitimation of children born out of wedlock whose parents subsequently married. By that time, O&#x27;Malley had aligned himself with the government of Charles Kingston, declaring himself &quot;on the side of the ministry&quot; and calling Kingston &quot;the greatest democratic leader this country had ever known&quot;. O&#x27;Malley strongly supported federation and, in a series of parliamentary speeches, championed the U.S. constitution as a model for Australia. However, little notice was taken of his views.

O&#x27;Malley was defeated when he stood for re-election in Encounter Bay at the April 1899 general election, with William Carpenter outpolling him by 14 votes, and Charles Tucker outpolling both. The election was fought largely on the temperance issue, with Tucker enjoying the support of the Licensed Victuallers&#x27; Association. The supporters of each camp clashed on a number of occasions, culminating in a &quot;near riot&quot; at Goolwa the day after the election. A petition was subsequently lodged against Tucker&#x27;s return, on the grounds that he had attempted to bribe electors. The result was declared void in July 1899 and another election ordered, which was equally acrimonious but resulted in a clear victory for Tucker against O&#x27;Malley.

==Federal politics==
=== Beginnings ===
O&#x27;Malley was defeated at the 1899 election, and the following year he moved to Tasmania, the smallest of the Australian colonies. There, a tall, fashionably-dressed American, preaching the gospel and radical democracy, drew immediate attention. At the 1901 federal election he became one of the five members of the House of Representatives for Tasmania. In 1903, he was elected as the member for Darwin. Although there was no Labour Party in Tasmania at that time, he joined the Labour Party Caucus when the parliament assembled in Melbourne.

Historian Gavin Souter describes O&#x27;Malley at this time:

O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s monstrously overgrown persona seemed to be inhabited simultaneously by a spruiker from Barnum&#x27;s three-ring circus, a hell-and-tarnation revivalist, and a four-flushing Yankee Congressman. He was a moderately big man, auburn-haired with watchful grey eyes and a red-brown beard, wearing a wide-brimmed felt hat, blue-grey suit with huge lapels and a low-cut vest, loose cravat with a diamond collar stud, and in the centre of his cream silk shirt-front a fiery opal.

=== Reputation ===
O&#x27;Malley was clearly one of the more prominent and colourful members of the Parliament. He became a prominent advocate of a national bank as a means of providing cheap credit for farmers and small businessmen, but his radical ideas were not widely accepted, and many regarded him as a charlatan.

He was not a member of Chris Watson&#x27;s first Labour ministry in 1904, nor of Andrew Fisher&#x27;s first ministry in 1908. But, in April 1910, the Caucus elected him to the ministry of Fisher&#x27;s second government. Ross McMullin, who wrote an official history of the ALP, suggested that &quot;his election as minister was probably attributable in part to the fact that several caucus colleagues owed him money&quot;.


===Canberra===
O&#x27;Malley is well known for his involvement in the development of the national capital, Canberra. Less well known is that, in the parliamentary ballots in October 1908 to select the area in which the capital would be located, he had not voted for Canberra. O&#x27;Malley voted for the rival site of Dalgety in the ninth and final ballot, having voted for Bombala and later Tooma in earlier elimination ballots.

O&#x27;Malley became Minister for Home Affairs, and played a prominent role in the planning and development of Canberra. He declared American architect Walter Burley Griffin winner of the town planning competition. On 20 February 1913, O&#x27;Malley drove in the first peg to mark the start of the development of the city. He was also present at the ceremony for the naming of Canberra on 12 March 1913.

As a teetotaler, he was responsible for the highly unpopular ban on selling alcohol in the Australian Capital Territory, which lasted from 1911 to 1928. He could also claim credit for beginning the building of the Trans-Australian Railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie.

===Commonwealth Bank===
O&#x27;Malley also agitated for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a state-owned savings and investment bank. However, contrary to his later claims, he was not the bank&#x27;s sole creator. He later wrote that he had led a &quot;torpedo squad&quot; in Caucus to force a reluctant Cabinet to establish the bank, but historians do not accept that. In fact, Prime Minister Fisher was the bank&#x27;s principal architect. Partly to allay fears of &quot;funny money&quot; aroused by O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s populist rhetoric, Fisher ensured that the bank would be run on firm &quot;sound money&quot; principles, and it did not provide the easy credit for farmers that the radicals desired.

===Final years in parliament===
Labor was defeated at the 1913 federal election and, when it returned to office at the 1914 federal election, O&#x27;Malley was not re-elected to the Cabinet. In October 1915, however, Fisher retired and O&#x27;Malley returned to office in the first ministry of Billy Hughes, again as Minister for Home Affairs. But a year later, the government split over the determination of Hughes to introduce conscription to fill the ranks of Australia&#x27;s armed forces in World War I. Although he was not an active anti-conscriptionist, O&#x27;Malley was pressured by Hughes to resign his portfolio, but he refused to do so. He finally lost office on 13 November 1916 when Hughes and twenty-four other Labor members walked out of the Caucus and formed the National Labor ministry.

Hughes called the 1917 federal election, and O&#x27;Malley was heavily defeated in his northern Tasmanian seat of Darwin by former Labor colleague Charles Howroyd, a conscriptionist who was running for Hughes&#x27; Nationalist Party. O&#x27;Malley suffered a swing of almost 15 percent against him, and was one of many Labor parliamentarians swept out in the massive Nationalist landslide. He stood unsuccessfully in the seat of Denison in 1919, and in Bass in 1922, but he was never again returned to elected office.

=== Others ===
On 23 April 1902, during the debate on the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 and the question of Maori suffrage, he claimed that &quot;an aboriginal is not as intelligent as a Maori. There is no scientific evidence that he is a human being at all.&quot;

==Later life==

Although he was only 63 at the time of his defeat, he retired to Melbourne and devoted his time to building up his own legend, particularly in relation to the Commonwealth Bank, and to polemical journalism on a variety of pet causes. He lived to be about 95, outliving his nemesis, Hughes, by 14 months. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving member of the first Australian Parliament and last surviving MP who served when the first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, was in office. Furthermore, O&#x27;Malley was the last surviving member of Andrew Fisher&#x27;s second Cabinet.

==Legacy==
O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s importance in developing the national capital is remembered in Canberra, with the suburb of O&#x27;Malley being named after him. A pub in Canberra, King O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s Irish Pub in Civic, is also named after him – a tongue-in-cheek reference to his sponsorship of the unpopular ban on selling alcohol in the Australian Capital Territory during Canberra&#x27;s early years.

More importantly, he and his wife Amy left their estate to create scholarship opportunities to support students studying &quot;domestic economy&quot; (now referred to as Home economics). Thirty scholarships were to be awarded annually, proportionally across the states and territories according to their then population. The first of the scholarships was awarded by the King and Amy O&#x27;Malley Trust in 1986, and they continue to be awarded.

O&#x27;Malley is the subject of a 1970 musical play &quot;The Legend of King O&#x27;Malley&quot; by Michael Boddy and Bob Ellis.

<doc id="1114981" wikidata="Q741612" url="?curid=1114981" title="Steeplechase Park">
<text>Steeplechase Park was an amusement park that operated in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City, United States, from 1897 to 1964. Steeplechase Park was created by the entrepreneur George C. Tilyou as the first of the three large amusement parks built on Coney Island, the other two being Luna Park (1903) and Dreamland (1904). Of the three, Steeplechase was the longest-lasting, running for 67 years.

The park covered at its peak. Its first rides were standalone attractions scattered around Coney Island that Tilyou had purchased in the early 1890s. Steeplechase itself opened in 1897 to unite these formerly separate attractions, and quickly gained popularity as a family-friendly destination with exhibitionist and risque undertones. It was destroyed by fire in 1907, but was quickly rebuilt. Steeplechase remained profitable as the Tilyou family continually brought in new rides and new amusements, such as the Parachute Jump. However, by the 1960s Steeplechase Park was becoming unprofitable due to high crime, the growth of suburban getaways, and the area&#x27;s general trend toward residential development.

After the park closed in 1964, developer Fred Trump purchased the land and planned to develop it for residential use, but this never occurred, and the site was used seasonally for amusement rides during the 1970s. A dispute ensued over the proposed use of the Steeplechase Park site in the 1980s and 1990s, as two developers disagreed over whether to rebuild the amusement park or build a sports complex on the site. A minor-league baseball stadium called Keyspan Park (now Maimonides Park) was built in 2001. 

The Parachute Jump is the only remaining portion of the former amusement park. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation maintains the land under Maimonides Park as part of a green space also called Steeplechase Park. Steeplechase Plaza, a portion of Luna Park (2010) that contains the B&amp;B Carousell, was named in homage to the former Steeplechase Park.

== History ==
Steeplechase was created by George C. Tilyou (1862–1914). On his honeymoon in 1893, he and his wife visited the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where he saw the Ferris wheel and wanted to buy it. Since the wheel had already been sold, Tilyou built his own half-size version at Surf Avenue, on Coney Island, which soon became Coney Island&#x27;s biggest attraction. After noting that the nearby Sheepshead Bay, Gravesend and Brighton Beach horseracing tracks were very popular, Tilyou added other rides and attractions on the Coney Island peninsula. He came to own several rides, though none were part of a single park. In fact, until the opening of Paul Boyton&#x27;s Sea Lion Park nearby in 1895, all of Coney Island&#x27;s rides were separately operated. As a result, Tilyou&#x27;s concessions were originally overshadowed by the saloons on nearby Bowery Street.

=== 1897–1907: Creation and early years ===

Steeplechase Park opened in 1897 after Tilyou bought and improved the Steeplechase Horses attraction. Steeplechase Horses, manufactured by J.W. Cawdry, featured gravity-pulled mechanical horses racing along metal tracks. The park covered , an area of which Tilyou owned two-thirds outright; the other third was leased from the Huber family. It was located at the western end of Bowery Street. Steeplechase was approached by a grand stone archway on Surf Avenue to the north, the top of the archway decorated by four stone horses. The inclusion of a gateway, along with a new 25-cent admission charge, were intended to exclude the &quot;seedier elements&quot; and make the park a family destination. Drinking was prohibited, as was gambling and prostitution.

The park included over 50 attractions on its midway alone. Attractions included novelties such as the Human Niagara, a Venetian gondola-style ride, the Aerial Racing Slide, the Double-Dip Chutes, the Bicycle Railway, a &quot;French Voyage&quot; panorama, and a Wild West sideshow. Tilyou also operated a small steam railroad, a saltwater pool, a ballroom, and the Scenic Railroad coaster by LaMarcus Thompson. Completing the park were scale models of world landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben. Steeplechase Pier, a pier jutting into the ocean, was built to the south of the park in 1904. Tilyou adopted a &quot;Funny Face&quot; mascot depicting a smiling man with several dozen teeth, nicknamed &quot;the Tilly&quot;, as the icon for his park. The mascot, which became a symbol of Coney Island, represented the area&#x27;s wholesomeness and neoclassical architecture combined with its veneer of hidden sexuality. Tilyou&#x27;s personal motto, &quot;Keep &#x27;em laughing&quot;, was symbolized by rides with such unconventional names as Whirlpool, Soup Bowl, Human Roulette, Human Pool Table, and Earthquake Staircase. 

In 1901, Tilyou visited the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, New York, to find additional rides for Steeplechase Park. He approached Frederic Thompson (no relation to LaMarcus) and Elmer &quot;Skip&quot; Dundy, the creators of the popular A Trip To The Moon ride, to ask if they would bring their ride to Steeplechase. The ride, an indoor dark ride that simulated a space flight, had been popular in the exposition, and Thompson and Dundy signed an agreement to relocate it to Steeplechase for a year. However, a rainy 1902 season reduced the profits of amusement park operators at Coney Island that year and forced the closure of the adjacent Sea Lion Park. Thompson and Dundy spent $700,000 rebuilding Sea Lion and moved Trip to the Moon to the newly expanded park, now called Luna Park, in 1903.

Following Luna Park&#x27;s success, another amusement park on Coney Island, Dreamland, opened in 1904. At Coney Island&#x27;s peak in the middle of the 20th century&#x27;s first decade, the three amusement parks competed with each other and with many independent amusements. This was attributed partially to the variety of transit options available: by 1904, there were five railroads to Coney Island. Both Luna Park and Dreamland had more expensive attractions than Steeplechase Park. Tilyou countered this by modifying and adding contraptions for his customers, most of which carried an exhibitionist and risque undertone but were nonetheless popular despite their vulgarity. The entrance contained the Barrel of Love, a revolving drum that threw visitors onto each other. Other contraptions included the Human Roulette Wheel, Earthquake Stairway, Dew Drop, Whichway, and Wedding Ring. All of these rides tossed riders around, often on top of each other, as they were designed under the assumption that men and women wanted any excuses to grab onto each other.

The success of Steeplechase and other parks in Coney Island inspired Tilyou to create additional amusement parks in the New York City area and elsewhere. In November 1904, Tilyou announced that he would sell Steeplechase Park to a syndicate of investors for $1.25 million, since he wanted to operate another amusement park in Rockaway, Queens. However, the sale of Steeplechase was annulled in February 1905 after $50,000 had been paid, since &quot;defective titles&quot; prevented the syndicate from purchasing some of the land under the park. From 1905 to 1907, Tilyou refined Steeplechase Park with attractions such as a miniature railroad, an orchestra stand, the Cave of the Winds, a Fads and Fantasy Building, the Limit Building, and a children&#x27;s pony track. The Limit Building was short-lived, being replaced by the Monte Carlo Building in 1907.

=== 1907 fire and rebuilding ===
In the early morning of July 29, 1907, a fire started in the Cave of the Winds attraction. It spread quickly, destroying most of the wooden pavilions and hotels around Bowery Street; firefighters fought to save Tilyou&#x27;s house at the corner of Steeplechase Park. The three-alarm fire was extinguished after two hours, but about of Coney Island was destroyed. Steeplechase Park bore much of the damage, which was estimated at $1.5 million, but several hotels were also ruined. Even though the fire destroyed nearly everything within Steeplechase Park, Tilyou reportedly remained calm throughout, even promising to host events that had been planned in the park before the fire. The morning after the fire, Tilyou posted a sign in front of the park, which read:

&quot;To My Friends: I have troubles today that I had not yesterday. I had troubles yesterday which I have not today. On this site will be built a bigger, better, Steeplechase Park. Admission to the burning ruins — Ten cents.&quot;
Tilyou stated that the park would be restored to a &quot;grander than ever&quot; condition, but in the meantime, he would erect temporary tent shows. The remaining attractions opened one week after the fire. Ultimately, the park was rebuilt with fireproof steel-and-concrete structures, as the municipality had passed a law restricting the construction of combustible wooden structures. The park&#x27;s reconstruction was funded by a $2 million stock measure issued by the Steeplechase Park Company, which Tilyou established in 1908. Tilyou sold 100,000 shares in that company to the public and gave a season pass to everyone who bought a $5 stock certificate. The park partially reopened in April 1908. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the construction as &quot;scarcely finished&quot; and that crowds &quot;flocked&quot; to the rebuilt attractions.The reconstruction was completed in 1909. The rebuilt park&#x27;s main attraction was the Pavilion of Fun, a steel-and-glass enclosure measuring , with an area of . It contained several rides and tawdry, exhibitionist attractions reminiscent of the previous iteration of Steeplechase Park, such as the Human Wheel, Human Niagara, the Mixer, and the Grinder. The Pavilion of Fun had opened during the 1908 season. The Ferris wheel was salvaged from the original park and was placed outdoors. A new Steeplechase Horses attraction was built around the pavilion, designed so that riders had to exit through the Pavilion of Fun. Steeplechase also included two new entrances, a plaza overlooking a sunken garden, the Palace of Pleasure, a ballroom, and various sideshows. Other attractions included airships, Venetian gondolas, and an Automobile ride similar to that in the first Steeplechase Park. There were eight roller coasters inside the rebuilt park as well. As before the fire, admission was 25 cents. A &quot;combo&quot; admission ticket entitled the holder to one experience on each of the park&#x27;s 25 attractions.

=== 1910s and 1920s ===
Tilyou continued to add attractions to Steeplechase in the late 1900s and early 1910s. He added the first of several carousels to the park in 1908, and the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Swimming Pool&quot; was completed the following year. Tilyou opened a hall with an indoor swimming pool to the west of the pavilion in 1911, at which point he declared that he wanted to add one new ride per week. Several attractions opened in 1912, including the El Dorado Carousel and other structures salvaged from Dreamland after it was destroyed in a 1911 fire. Around this time, local residents and businesspeople were advocating for the construction of a public beach and boardwalk along the Atlantic Ocean. The New York Supreme Court ruled in 1913 that the state government could take over a section of Steeplechase Park, along the Atlantic shoreline, to make way for the public beach.

In 1914, Tilyou died, leaving the care of the park to his children; Thomas F. McGowan then became general manager of the park. Steeplechase would remain within the Tilyou family until it closed a half-century later. George&#x27;s oldest son Edward, an 18-year-old at the time of his father&#x27;s death, constructed a skating rink at Steeplechase in 1915. A Racing Derby Carousel by master carousel builder Marcus Illions was added in 1920, and it featured 16 rows of four horses cycling up-and-down on small tracks within the carousel. Shortly afterward, Edward Tilyou also added &quot;Babyland&quot;, a children&#x27;s play area near the southeast corner of the park. Other attractions built in the early 1920s included the Frolic spinning ride, bumper cars, the Witchway swing, and a Caterpillar flat ride. By the early 1920s, the crowds at Steeplechase and other Coney Island parks had become more mellow and orderly, though the beachfront in general was described as rundown. Steeplechase Park started hosting several beauty contests near its outdoor pool, providing more entertainment for park patrons. These included the &quot;Modern Venus&quot; Bathing Beauty Contest, first held in 1922, and Grandma&#x27;s Beauty Contest, which started in 1932.

This period also saw the destruction of some structures, such as the Upside-Down House burning down in 1911. Additionally, Steeplechase lost its private beach during the early 1910s. Following a 1912 lawsuit by New York State against Tilyou and other amusement owners for taking private ownership of Coney Island&#x27;s beach, a judge ruled in 1913 that the beach actually belonged to the state. An appellate court affirmed this decision in 1916, with an exception made for part of Steeplechase Park, a plot of land granted by the state prior to the creation of the park itself. All obstructions on the beachfront, including a concrete walk within Steeplechase, were demolished in accordance with the ruling.

The Riegelmann Boardwalk was opened on the waterfront in 1922. In conjunction with the boardwalk&#x27;s opening, the city slightly relocated West 16th and West 19th Streets at Steeplechase Park&#x27;s eastern and western borders, respectively, which resulted in a slight expansion to Steeplechase&#x27;s area. The boardwalk&#x27;s opening resulted in increases to real estate valuations at nearby areas, such as Steeplechase Park, though some lots were also taken from the park to make way for new streets leading to the boardwalk. As a result, a former Brooklyn engineer alleged that the Tilyous lost money from the relocation of West 16th and West 19th Streets. The boardwalk&#x27;s completion and a subsequent widening of Surf Avenue in 1924 prompted Edward Tilyou to make additional improvements to Steeplechase Park. The mid-1920s were described as the &quot;golden age&quot; of roller coasters on Coney Island: two gravity rides called the Zip and the Limit were constructed in Steeplechase Park, and immediately to the east, independent ride operator George Moran built the Thunderbolt roller coaster. Also built were a water ride called the &quot;Old Mill tunnel of love&quot; and a Noah&#x27;s Ark-style attraction. Thomas McGowan died unexpectedly in 1927 and was replaced by James J. Onorato. The following year, one of the pools was demolished and replaced with an attraction called Hey Day, while a gas-powered Custer Cars attraction was installed on the boardwalk.

=== 1930s: Great Depression through World War II ===
The Great Depression resulted in significantly decreased attendance at Steeplechase Park. Before money ran out, a one-ring circus was constructed between the Limit coaster and an adjacent pool, while a children&#x27;s wading pool was constructed. In addition, a carousel was constructed at West 16th Street in 1930, and the Whale and the Whip replaced Noah&#x27;s Ark the following year. People still came to see the beauty contests at Steeplechase Park. In 1934, when finances slowly started to improve, a bobsled roller coaster model called Flying Turns was installed at Steeplechase.

Several accidents and fires continued to occur at Steeplechase. A fire in July 1932 caused $1.5 million in damage and injured six people, and left at least a thousand people homeless. However, Steeplechase Park and Luna Park were not as heavily damaged since the fire was mostly concentrated to the west. There were other incidents as well: in 1933, fifty-seven people were hurt in a balcony collapse caused by overcrowding, and three years later, a barge crashed into the Steeplechase Pier. In addition, patrons frequently received minor injuries such as friction burns, though some people were thrown or fell from rides, and one child died after falling off the Steeplechase Horses in 1935. A conflagration in September 1939 caused $200,000 in damage and injured 18 people. The concessions on the boardwalk were destroyed, as was the entrance to the park from the boardwalk, and several attractions within the park itself. The following year, a new brick concession structure was built on the site of the old concessions, and an Express Train ride was erected in front of the pavilion.

The 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, several miles to the northeast of Coney Island, had created competition for Coney Island amusement parks, which saw sharply reduced attendance. Steeplechase&#x27;s situation was exacerbated by the September 1939 fire, which had destroyed many of the larger attractions, including Flying Turns. After the World&#x27;s Fair closed in 1940, the Tilyous purchased the fair&#x27;s Parachute Jump, a parachute tower ride, and moved it to the former site of Flying Turns. The ride, inspired by a training device for paratroopers, opened in 1941 and contained 12 parachutes descending from a tower. The Parachute Jump&#x27;s installation was part of a reconstruction of an stretch of the Riegelmann Boardwalk. Other rides were added at Steeplechase in 1941, including rocket cars, a Whip ride, and the Silver Streak. The draft during World War II resulted in a shortage of qualified staff, and Onorato temporarily closed the Pavilion of Fun in 1945 due to the staff shortage. Only 70 people worked at Steeplechase that year, compared to 300 in a normal operating year; the park returned to normal staffing levels in 1946. 

=== 1940s and 1950s: downfall ===
Despite the park&#x27;s popularity with New Yorkers, many factors after the end of World War II would eventually lead to its decline, including frequent fires, low patronage, and white flight. Steeplechase&#x27;s closest competitor, Luna Park, was heavily damaged by a pair of fires in 1944. Luna Park closed in 1946, leaving Steeplechase as the only major amusement park on Coney Island. Moreover, after Edward Tilyou died in 1944, control of the park was transferred to his siblings George Jr., Frank, Marie, and Eileen, who each owned a quarter share in the Steeplechase Corporation. The relationship between the siblings was fractious, and they often argued about Steeplechase&#x27;s management.

In 1945, the Tilyou siblings leased out the boardwalk carousel to their cousin James J. McCullough. They rented out the pool in 1946; the pool&#x27;s new operators instituted a season pass scheme that effectively locked out African Americans from using the pool, despite the fact that an increasing proportion of Steeplechase visitors was African-American. Park officials also discontinued the use of a flat admission fee and began selling tickets at three prices. The ballroom was also split in half to create a TV studio in 1947. The same year, the Tilyou siblings discontinued the combination ticket and started offering a pass where patrons could go on any 15 rides for one dollar. In practice, not many people bought the 15-ride pass, since various special-interest groups such as social, political, and religious organizations had designated days where they could visit Steeplechase Park for free. Steeplechase also saw its 20-millionth visitor that year. The Tilyous added extra rides for the 1948 season, including the Scrambler, the C-Cruise, and several children&#x27;s rides. Onorato added a &quot;lost kids&#x27; department&quot; at the park in 1951 for children who had become separated from their guardians.

Steeplechase Park continued its downward trajectory with the demolition of several rides and structures and the neglect of others. The skating rink, now used only for the Tilyous&#x27; private functions, was demolished in December 1951. The following year, several structures on West 19th Street were demolished, as was the little-used Old Mill boat ride that ran under one of these structures; the site was filled by a parking lot in 1954. Other impediments included a 1953 flood and fire, which destroyed machinery; the death of the Tilyou siblings&#x27; mother in 1954, which caused further acrimony among the siblings; and the underpayment of employees, which was one of the main reasons Steeplechases&#x27; employees were mostly elderly citizens who could afford to take such a low wage. The park started becoming profitable again when &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot; started broadcasting from Steeplechase in 1955. After Steeplechase Pier was destroyed by fire in 1957, a larger replacement opened the next year. George Tilyou Jr. died in 1958, and his sister Marie took over as Steeplechase Corporation president the next year, demoting James Onorato to general manager. Marie, who had long wanted to change Steeplechase&#x27;s image against the wishes of her brothers, began adding rides for the 1959 and 1960 seasons, such as a Tilt-a-Whirl, a Round Up ride, and a Paratrooper ride.

=== Demise ===
New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses was a longtime critic of Coney Island, describing the beach as so crowded that bathers had less room than in a coffin. As early as 1937, he had published a report about the possible redevelopment of Coney Island. Moses, who was also a New York City housing commissioner, rezoned the area for high-rise housing in the late 1940s. Subsequently, in 1953, Moses proposed that most of the peninsula be rezoned for various uses, claiming that it would be an &quot;upgrade&quot; over the various business and unrestricted zones that existed at the time. Steeplechase Park would be allowed to remain open, but much of the shorefront amusements and concessions would be replaced by residential developments.

At the time, Coney Island was seeing fewer visitors year-over-year. Crime increases, insufficient parking facilities, bad weather, and the post-World War II automotive boom were cited as contributing factors in the decrease of visitors to Coney Island. The start of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, also in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, was another factor. Ironically, prior to the World&#x27;s Fair, Steeplechase Park was seeing record high patronage; the highest single-day visitor count, over 18,000 customers, was recorded in 1961. Nevertheless, it also faced problems of its own: a severe assault of an employee in 1961 forced the closure of the Insanitorium, while Marie Tilyou was opposed to her nephew Frank II&#x27;s proposal to bring rides from the Century 21 Exposition to the park. Further, Steeplechase had been leasing one-third of its land from the Huber family, which decided to sell that land in 1962. More attractions were destroyed in a 1963 fire, which razed two blocks on Steeplechase&#x27;s west side. High crime was also rampant; for instance, a mass shooting nearby in 1962 resulted in three people being killed, and visitors were generally afraid of being attacked by residents of nearby public housing projects. By 1964, the area had seen its lowest number of patrons in a quarter-century. The Tilyou family was paying $120,000 annually in taxes.

By the early 1960s, the children of George C. Tilyou were themselves aging; his last surviving son, Frank, died in 1964. The shares of Steeplechase Park were now held by four women—Marie, Eileen, and the respective widows of Frank and George Jr.—all of whom had differing visions for the park. Steeplechase Park closed for the season on September 20, 1964, for what would be the last time. Though no official closure announcement was made, rumors of a sale started circulating in February 1965. Developer Fred Trump bought the property for $2.5 million on July 1, 1965, and announced his intention to build luxury apartments on the old Steeplechase property. Though the sale was opposed by the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce, it was consistent with the area&#x27;s gradual conversion into a residential community. At the time of its closure, Steeplechase Park was Coney Island&#x27;s longest-lasting attraction; it had outlasted the original park&#x27;s steeplechase attractions by more than a half-century. 

== Later use of the site ==

=== Trump ownership and Kaufman operation ===

==== 1960s ====
Trump demolished Steeplechase Park&#x27;s Pavilion of Fun during a highly publicized ceremony in September 1966. At the demolition, he was said to have sold bricks to ceremony guests to smash the remaining glass windows on the Pavilion of Fun. Trump supposedly destroyed the pavilion to circumvent a landmark law being proposed by the city following the demolition of the old Pennsylvania Station in 1963. Mechanical horses from Steeplechase Park were sold to a park in Dania Beach, Florida, while the El Dorado Carousel was first placed into storage in New Jersey and then sent to Japan. On part of Steeplechase Park&#x27;s site, Trump proposed building a enclosed dome with recreational facilities and a convention center, designed by Morris Lapidus. Brooklyn borough president Abe Stark supported the proposal, while the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce opposed the plans, saying the proposed dome was too small to accommodate recreational uses. Trump wanted to build four 30-story apartment towers, with a total of 3,000 apartments, on the remainder of the site.

The Coney Island Chamber of Commerce submitted plans to Stark for a resort on Steeplechase Park&#x27;s site in December 1965. In October 1966, the city announced its plans to acquire the former park so that the land could be reserved for recreational use. Although residents supported the city&#x27;s action, Trump called the city&#x27;s proposal &quot;wasteful&quot;. The New York City Planning Commission rezoned the Steeplechase site for recreational use around 1967. The same year, Trump started leasing the property to Norman Kaufman, who operated fairground amusements on a corner of the site, calling his amusement park &quot;Steeplechase Park&quot;. Kaufman and his partner Irving Vichinsky operated 53 rides, including three roller coasters. 

New York City parks commissioner August Heckscher II proposed in January 1968 that the New York state government build an &quot;open-space&quot; state park on the Steeplechase site, and the New York City Board of Estimate voted that May in favor of funding to buy the land from Trump. Condemnation of the site started in 1969. The city ultimately purchased the proposed park&#x27;s site for $4 million, with partial funding from the federal government. As a condition of the deal, the sale or lease of the future parkland required permission from the New York State Legislature, thus blocking Trump from developing the site as apartments.

==== 1970s and early 1980s ====
Trump filed a series of court cases related to the proposed residential rezoning and ultimately won a $1.3 million judgment. After the city acquired the land, Kaufman began leasing the site from the city in 1970. The city also leased out the boardwalk and parking lot sites at extremely low rates, which resulted in a $1 million loss of revenue over the following seven years. Since the city wanted to build the state park on the site of Kaufman&#x27;s Steeplechase Park, it attempted to evict him by refusing to grant a lease extension. The city government first tried to evict Kaufman by refusing to give licenses to any of his rides, but Kaufman continued to operate rides there, even after one of his employees died in 1974. A state judge granted the city the right to evict Kaufman in December 1974 but ruled that Kaufman could stay through the 1975 season.

NYC Parks was supposed to have devised a plan for the proposed state park in 1969, but it never did so. Under the terms of Kaufman&#x27;s lease, the city could evict him with 30 days&#x27; notice once it had devised a plan for a park. Due to the city&#x27;s inaction, in 1975, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development nearly withdrew a proposed grant of $2 million for the park. The city ultimately accepted the grant. In early 1977, city officials again attempted to evict Kaufman and force him to pay back rent, but a state judge rejected these claims. That June, the city&#x27;s parks commissioner suggested that the city would redevelop the original Steeplechase Park&#x27;s site as an amusement area instead of an open-air state park and proposed that the city return the grant. This move was opposed by the chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, who wanted to use the grant to pay for pedestrian walkways at the Steeplechase site. 

In 1977 and 1978, Kaufman withheld rent payments to the city because of the ongoing litigation, and he sued the city for $1.7 million. By 1979, Kaufman had expanded his park and had plans to eventually rebuild the historic Steeplechase Park. He had also bought back the original Steeplechase horse ride with plans to install it the following season. Kaufman continued to operate the site until the end of summer 1980. In June 1981, the city paid Kaufman a million dollars for the rides, even though the amusements were estimated to be worth much less than that. However, the city had finally succeeded in evicting Kaufman from the property.

=== Development as stadium ===
In the mid-1980s, restaurant mogul Horace Bullard proposed rebuilding Steeplechase Park. He had already bought several acres of property just east of the Steeplechase Park site, including the site of the defunct Thunderbolt coaster and the lots west of the Abe Stark rink, and planned to spend $20 million just on cleaning up the neighborhood. He called for using the property, bounded by West 15th and West 19th Streets between Surf Avenue and the Boardwalk, to build a $55 million amusement park based on the original. The city agreed, and the project was approved in 1985. Bullard planned to open the park by mid-1986 to coincide with the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s centennial celebration. The project was delayed while the New York City Planning Commission compiled an environmental impact report. The New York City Council and the State Legislature also had to agree to lease some of the land to Bullard, but the legislative bodies did not give their approval until mid-1986. By early 1987, the cost of the amusement park had nearly doubled to $100 million. The city government gave final approval to Bullard&#x27;s plans in 1989, at which point the park was supposed to cost $250 million and open in May 1992.

Concurrently, in December 1986, the New York State Urban Development Corporation formally proposed the construction of a $58 million, 17,000-seat minor-league baseball stadium near the site. State senator Thomas Bartosiewicz attempted to block Bullard from building on the Steeplechase site, as he was part of an organization that had promised another developer, Sportsplex, the right to build an amateur sports arena on the site. Construction was held up for another four years as Bullard and Sportsplex fought over the site.

After Rudy Giuliani took office as mayor of New York in 1994, he negated the Bullard deal by approving the construction of a minor-league baseball stadium on the site allotted for Steeplechase Park. In 1998, Giuliani had canceled Sportsplex and the entertainment complex, and instead unveiled another plan where only the parking lot would be built. The minor league team was called the Brooklyn Cyclones. Bullard, now no longer rebuilding Steeplechase Park, had wanted to restore the Thunderbolt as part of a scaled-down amusement park. Giuliani had the coaster demolished on the grounds that the Thunderbolt was about to collapse, though the coaster&#x27;s destruction took weeks. In 2000, the city approved the $31 million Keyspan Park (now Maimonides Park), which used funds from the canceled Sportsplex. The 6,500-seat minor-league baseball stadium opened the following year, in conjunction with the Brooklyn Cyclones&#x27; inaugural season in 2001.

== Current status ==
Much of the former Steeplechase Park site is occupied by Maimonides Park. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation owns the land under Maimonides Park and maintains it as &quot;Steeplechase Park&quot;. A public plaza on the boardwalk is located to the south of Maimonides Park and operated by NYC Parks.

In November 2011, work started on a site around the Parachute Jump, to be called Steeplechase Plaza. The city also announced that the historic B&amp;B Carousell, which had been stored at the Brooklyn Army Terminal since 2005, would be relocated to Steeplechase Plaza within Luna Park. The carousel opened in 2013 at the Steeplechase Plaza section of Luna Park, near the former site of Steeplechase Park. The carousel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. The plaza is adjacent to Thunderbolt, a steel coaster that opened in 2014 on the site of the original wooden Thunderbolt.

The only structure still standing that was once part of Steeplechase is the Parachute Jump. It had been proposed for demolition in the mid-20th century. Due to the expense involved in destruction, the ride outlived the remainder of the park, operating until 1964. Still too expensive to tear down, the tower was made a New York City designated landmark in 1977. Three months later the New York City Board of Estimate overturned the landmark designation, citing doubts about the tower&#x27;s structural integrity. In 1980, the Parachute Jump was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1989, the Parachute Jump was once again recognized as a city landmark.

<text>The Bazaar of Tabriz (, also Romanized as &quot;Bāzār-e Tabriz&quot; , also Romanized as &quot;Tabriz Bazari&quot;) is a historic market in central Tabriz, Iran. It is one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East and the largest covered bazaar in the world. It is one of Iran&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==History==
Tabriz has been a place of cultural exchange since antiquity. Its historic bazaar complex is one of the most important commercial centres on the Silk Road. A bazaar has existed on the same site since the early periods of Iranian urbanism following Islam. The bazaar was mentioned by the Venetian traveler Marco Polo, who claimed to have passed through it while journeying on the Silk Road. 

Al-Maqdisi in 10th century, Yaqut al-Hamawi in ca. 1213 CE, Zakariya al-Qazwini in ca. 1252 CE, Marco Polo in 1271 CE, Odoric of Pordenone in ca. 1321 CE, Ibn Battuta in ca. 1330 CE, Ambrogio Contarini in 1474 CE, Hamdallah Mustawfi in around 13th to 14th century, John Cartwright in 1606 CE, Jean Chardin at the time of Suleiman I of Persia, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier in ca. 1636 CE, Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri in ca. 1642 CE and dozens of other explorers and historians have written about the Bazaar of Tabriz, which shows its importance and significance through the different periods of history.

Located in the center of the city of Tabriz, the structure is divided into rows, many devoted to particular categories of product. These include Amir Bazaar (for gold and jewelry), Mozzafarieh (hand woven rugs, sorted by knot size and type), Bashmakhchi Bazaar (shoes), Kiz Basdi Bazaar, and Rahli Bazaar (produce). Tabriz and its bazaar were at their most prosperous in the 16th century, when the town became the capital city of Safavid Iran. The city lost this status in the 17th century, but its bazaar has remained important as a commercial and economic hub in the region and on the silk road. Although numerous modern shops and malls have been established in recent years, Tabriz Bazaar has kept its vital role as economic hub of the city and northwestern Iran.

The bazaar was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2010.

==Ceremonies==
The bazaar is used for some important religious ceremonies. 

==Restoration==
In 2000, the Historical Hermitages Organization of Iran begin a restoration project of the Bazaar, with the full participation of the shop owners. The rehabilitation project won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2013.

<doc id="1114983" wikidata="Q7767150" url="?curid=1114983" title="The Subservient Chicken">
<text>The Subservient Chicken is an advertising program created to promote international fast food restaurant chain Burger King&#x27;s TenderCrisp chicken sandwich and their &quot;Have it Your Way&quot; campaign. Created for the Miami-based advertising firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B) by The Barbarian Group, the program featured a viral marketing website, television and print campaigns and a one-time pay-per-view program. The program was similar to other marketing campaigns created by CP+B for Burger King, including the Coq Roq, Ugoff, and Sith Sense.

==History==
The TenderCrisp sandwich was first advertised using the Subservient Chicken character in a commercial called &quot;the Subservient Chicken Vest&quot;. The commercial was the first in a series of ads for the sandwich utilizing a line of viral marketing promotions by Crispin Porter + Bogusky for Burger King. In the ad, a man is sitting in his living room directing a person in a chicken suit to behave in any way he wants. The tag line was &quot;Chicken the way you like it.&quot; According to Jeff Benjamin, an Executive Creative Director at CP+B, the campaign evolved from a television idea into an interactive one. After the success of the Subservient Chicken, Burger King used the character in several subsequent advertising campaigns.

===Other advertising programs===

;Fantasy Ranch
:The TenderCrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch sandwich was promoted in the United States by a 2005 television advertising campaign directed by David LaChapelle and featuring recording artist Darius Rucker (of Hootie and the Blowfish) singing a country-style jingle to the tune of &quot;The Big Rock Candy Mountains.&quot; The ad also starred television presenter Brooke Burke, model Vida Guerra, and members of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.
;ChickenFight.com
:With the introduction of the Spicy TenderCrisp Sandwich, CP+B created the Chicken Fight ad program. The ads featured a forthcoming boxing match billed as &quot;The two &quot;cockfighting chickens&quot;&quot; between two people in chicken suits, one as &quot;TC&quot; and the other as &quot;Spicy&quot;, a second chicken with orange &quot;plumage&quot;. The actual &quot;fight&quot; was broadcast as one time short on DirecTV.
;Big Buckin&#x27; Chicken/Big Huckin&#x27; Chicken
:In March 2006, &quot;Big Buckin&#x27; Chicken&quot; commercial for Tendercrisp Cheesy Bacon Chicken Sandwich featured the Subservient Chicken again. The TV ad showed 8 mm-style footage of a cowboy riding the chicken in a rodeo while people on the sideline cheer on. An accompanying jingle states, &quot;Big buckin&#x27; chicken/you are big, you are chicken.&quot; The voice over concludes that &quot;the only way to beat it, is to eat it.&quot; The character was reused in another TenderCrisp ad riding a dirt bike, titled &quot;Big Huckin&#x27; Chicken&quot;.
;Chicken BIG KING
:In April 2014, Burger King celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Subservient Chicken in promotion of the Chicken BIG KING Sandwich. Subservient Chicken celebrated his anniversary in a short film where he trained for his return to fame after his fall into irrelevancy over the years. 

==Internet==
In addition to the commercials, there was &quot;The Subservient Chicken&quot; web page. On the page, a man in a chicken costume performed a wide range of actions based on a user&#x27;s input, showing pre-recorded footage and appearing like an interactive webcam. The site takes literally the advertising slogan &quot;Get chicken just the way you like it&quot;. The site launched on April 8, 2004. The site was created for CP+B and BK by The Barbarian Group and is hosted at GSI in Kansas City, Missouri.
&quot;The guy in the suit was originally an actor, but he was claustrophobic in the suit, so he wouldn&#x27;t do it. And we had to use one of the costume&#x27;s designers... He would do about six moves and then we would have to fan him off because he would get so hot in the costume,&quot; says CP+B ECD Jeff Benjamin.

<text>Ideas and Action is an anarcho-syndicalist journal that was founded in 1981 as a result of numerous conferences organized by the New York Metropolitan area Libertarian Workers&#x27; Group and the Syndicalist Alliance of Milwaukee. In 1984, the newly formed Workers Solidarity Alliance took over publication of the journal.

Publication of &quot;Ideas and Action&quot; was suspended after issue #17 (1997). In 2010, an online version of the publication was launched and continues to publish new material.

<text>Folkton is a small village and civil parish at the foot of the Yorkshire Wolds and on the edge of the Vale of Pickering on an area known as Folkton Carr (carr meaning low lands) in North Yorkshire, England. 

Until 1974 the village lay in the historic county boundaries of the East Riding of Yorkshire and from 1974 until 2023 was part of the Borough of Scarborough.

St John&#x27;s Church, Folkton was built in the 12th century. Folkton House, the former rectory is located on Filey Road. Towards Flixton is the former village school which is now closed, built in 1832.

According to the 2011 UK Census, Folkton parish had a population of 535, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 461.

== Geography ==

To the south are the Wolds and further north, across the Carrs and up the hills at the other side of the Vale is Scarborough, beyond which to the north-west are the Yorkshire Moors.

== History ==

=== Prehistoric features ===
The area has been settled for many thousands of years. Above the village, at the top of Folkton Hill, was where the &quot;Folkton Drums&quot; were discovered. They are a set of chalk (the predominant stone in the area) carvings from the Stone Age. Bowl-shaped, they have been called drums as the carvings would be upside down were they to be used as bowls. They were discovered by William Greenwell in 1889. They were buried in a tumulus that sits at the intersection of several natural pathways through the Dales. This tumulus has now been identified as one of a network that acted as a guide through the maze of hills and valleys that make up the Dales which would have been heavily forested at the time. They can now be seen on display at the British Museum.

=== Modern history ===
The Carr would have historically been lake or marsh depending on which climatic era is being discussed. Its natural state today would be as marsh land but it was drained in the 19th century to make room for agriculture.

The village was also the site of a Roman military base. Not much is known of this stage as subsequent building works have destroyed any archaeology; however, the regular finds of Roman artefacts such as coins and arrow heads indicate a substantial presence.

The village as it stands today was established with a small number of farm houses around 400 years ago. Later building added to and expanded these existing structures into larger houses and farms with attached barns. Many barns were then demolished during the 1800s to avoid the &#x27;Roof Tax&#x27;.

In 1823 the Folkton parish was in the Wapentake of Dickering. Population at the time was 144. Occupations included three farmers, and the landlady of The Bell public house. Two miles to the west of the village, in the Folkton parish, and separated by one mile, were the settlements of East and West Flotmanby, each listed with a gentleman.

The town achieved greater prominence in 1327, when Charles IV elevated Louis I de Clermont to Duke of Bourbon. Either Louis or the later Peter II, Duke of Bourbon and of Auvergne moved the capital of the province from Bourbon-l&#x27;Archambault to Moulins.

:&quot;Note: This article in French suggests Pierre II moved the capital, while the local tourism website (also in French) suggests it was Louis I.&quot;

In February 1566 it became eponymous to the Edict of Moulins, an important royal ordinance dealing with many aspects of the administration of justice and feudal and ecclesiastical privilege, including limitations on the appanages held by French princes, abrogation of the levy of rights of tallage claimed by seigneurs over their dependants, and provisions for a system of concessions on rivers.

This was the birthplace of the great 19th-century operatic baritone and art collector Jean-Baptiste Faure. In the 20th century, Coco Chanel went to school in Moulins as an orphan, before moving to Paris, where she became a fashion designer and major innovator in women&#x27;s clothing.

<doc id="1115023" wikidata="Q684469" url="?curid=1115023" title="Erlkönig">
<text>&quot;Erlkönig&quot; is a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It depicts the death of a child assailed by a supernatural being, the Erlking, a king of the fairies. It was originally written by Goethe as part of a 1782 &quot;Singspiel&quot;, .

&quot;Erlkönig&quot; has been called Goethe&#x27;s &quot;most famous ballad&quot;. The poem has been set to music by several composers, most notably by Franz Schubert.

== Summary ==
An anxious young boy is being carried at night by his father on horseback. To where is not spelled out; German &quot;&quot; has a rather broad meaning of &quot;yard&quot;, &quot;courtyard&quot;, &quot;farm&quot;, or &quot;(royal) court&quot;. The opening line tells that the time is late and that it is windy.

As the poem unfolds, the son claims to see and hear the &quot;Erlkönig&quot; (Erl-King). His father claims to not see or hear the creature, and he attempts to comfort his son, asserting natural explanations for what the child sees – a wisp of fog, rustling leaves, shimmering willows.

The Erl-King attempts to lure the child into joining him, promising amusement, rich clothes, and the attentions of his daughters. Finally, the Erl-King declares that he will take the child by force. The boy shrieks that he has been attacked, spurring the father to ride faster to the . Upon reaching the destination, the child is already dead.

== Text ==
== The legend ==
The story of the Erlkönig derives from the traditional Danish ballad &quot;Elveskud&quot;: Goethe&#x27;s poem was inspired by Johann Gottfried Herder&#x27;s translation of a variant of the ballad (&quot;Danmarks gamle Folkeviser 47B&quot;, from Peter Syv&#x27;s 1695 edition) into German as (&quot;The Erl-King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;) in his collection of folk songs, (published 1778). Goethe&#x27;s poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking. Niels Gade&#x27;s cantata , Op. 30 (1854, text by ) was published in translation as .

 In the original Scandinavian version of the tale, the antagonist was the Erlkönig&#x27;s daughter rather than the Erlkönig himself.

== Settings to music ==
The poem has often been set to music, with Franz Schubert&#x27;s rendition, his Opus 1 (D. 328), being the best known. Probably the next-best known is that of Carl Loewe (1818). Other notable settings are by members of Goethe&#x27;s circle, including actress Corona Schröter (1782), Andreas Romberg (1793), Johann Friedrich Reichardt (1794), and Carl Friedrich Zelter (1797). Ludwig van Beethoven attempted to set it to music, but abandoned the effort; his sketch, however, was full enough to be published in a completion by Reinhold Becker (1897). A few other 19th-century versions are those by Václav Tomášek (1815), Carl Borromäus von Miltitz (1835), and Louis Spohr (1856, with obbligato violin; Op. 154 No. 4) and Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst (Polyphonic Studies for Solo Violin), though his was essentially a transcription of Schubert&#x27;s version for solo violin. Twenty-first-century examples are pianist Marc-André Hamelin&#x27;s &quot;Etude No. 8 (after Goethe)&quot; for solo piano, based on &quot;Erlkönig&quot;. Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein inspired their song Dalai Lama by the motifs in this poem. 

=== Franz Schubert composition ===

Franz Schubert composed his &quot;Lied&quot; &quot;Erlkönig&quot; for solo voice and piano at the age of 17 or 18 in 1815, setting text from Goethe&#x27;s poem. The work was first performed in concert on 1 December 1820 at a private gathering in Vienna. The public premiere on 7 March 1821 at the Theater am Kärntnertor was a great success, and he quickly rose to fame among the composers in Vienna. It is one of Schubert&#x27;s most famous works, with enduring popularity and acclaim since its premiere in 1821.

=== Carl Loewe composition ===
Carl Loewe&#x27;s setting was published as Op. 1, No. 3 and composed in 1817–18, in the lifetime of the poem&#x27;s author and also of Schubert, whose version Loewe did not then know. Collected with it were Op. 1, No. 1, &quot;Edward&quot; (1818; a translation of the Scottish ballad), and No. 2, &quot;&quot; (1823; &quot;The Innkeeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot;), a poem of Ludwig Uhland. Inspired by a German translation of Scottish border ballads, Loewe set several poems with an elvish theme; but although all three of Op. 1 are concerned with untimely death, in this set only the &quot;Erlkönig&quot; has the supernatural element.

Loewe&#x27;s accompaniment is in semiquaver groups of six in time and marked (fast). The vocal line evokes the galloping effect by repeated figures of crotchet and quaver, or sometimes three quavers, overlying the binary tremolo of the semiquavers in the piano. In addition to an unusual sense of motion, this creates a flexible template for the stresses in the words to fall correctly within the rhythmic structure.

Loewe&#x27;s version is less melodic than Schubert&#x27;s, with an insistent, repetitive harmonic structure between the opening minor key and answering phrases in the major key of the dominant, which have a stark quality owing to their unusual relationship to the home key. The narrator&#x27;s phrases are echoed by the voices of father and son, the father taking up the deeper, rising phrase, and the son a lightly undulating, answering theme around the dominant fifth. These two themes also evoke the rising and moaning of the wind.

The Erl-King, who is always heard pianissimo, does not sing melodies, but instead delivers insubstantial rising arpeggios that outline a single major chord (that of the home key) which sounds simultaneously on the piano in &quot;una corda&quot; tremolo. Only with his final threatening word, &quot;Gewalt&quot;, does he depart from this chord. Loewe&#x27;s implication is that the Erlking has no substance but merely exists in the child&#x27;s feverish imagination. As the piece progresses, the first in the groups of three quavers is dotted to create a breathless pace, which then forms a bass figure in the piano driving through to the final crisis. The last words, , leap from the lower dominant to the sharpened third of the home key; this time not to the major but to a diminished chord, which settles chromatically through the home key in the major and then to the minor.

<doc id="1115025" wikidata="Q739522" url="?curid=1115025" title="Freddie Bartholomew">
<text>Frederick Cecil Bartholomew (March 28, 1924 – January 23, 1992), known for his acting work as Freddie Bartholomew, was an English-American child actor who was very popular in 1930s Hollywood films. His most famous starring roles are in &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937) and &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; (1936).
Bartholomew was born in London in 1924. In 1934, for the title role of MGM&#x27;s &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1935), he immigrated to the United States at age 10, living there for the rest of his life. He became an American citizen in 1943, following World War II military service.

Despite his great success and acclaim following &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, his childhood film stardom was marred by nearly constant legal battles and payouts, which eventually took a huge toll on both his finances and his career. In adulthood, after World War II service, his film career dwindled rapidly and he switched from performing to directing and producing in the medium of television.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bartholomew was born Frederick Cecil Bartholomew in March 1924, in Harlesden, in the borough of Willesden, Middlesex, London. His parents were Cecil Llewellyn Bartholomew, a wounded World War I veteran who became a minor civil servant after the war, and Lilian May Clarke Bartholomew. By age three, Freddie was living in Warminster, a town in Wiltshire in South West England, in his paternal grandparents&#x27; home. He lived under the care of his &quot;Aunt Cissie&quot; (Millicent Mary Bartholomew), who raised him and became his surrogate mother. Bartholomew was educated at Lord Weymouth&#x27;s Grammar School in Warminster, and by his Aunt Cissie.

===Child star===
====From England to Hollywood====
In Warminster, Bartholomew was a precocious actor and was reciting and performing from age three. By age five, he was a popular Warminster celebrity, the &quot;boy wonder elocutionist&quot;, reciting poems, prose, and selections from various plays, including Shakespeare. He sang and danced as well. His first film role came at age six, in 1930.

He also pursued acting studies at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London, and appeared in four minor British films. American filmmakers George Cukor and David O. Selznick saw him on a 1934 scouting trip to London and chose him for the young title role in their MGM film, &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. Bartholomew and his aunt immigrated to the United States in August 1934, and MGM gave him a seven-year contract.

&quot;David Copperfield&quot;, which also featured Basil Rathbone, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, W. C. Fields and Lionel Barrymore, was a success and made Bartholomew an overnight star. He was subsequently cast in a succession of film productions with some of the most popular stars of the day. Among his successes of the 1930s were &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; with Greta Garbo and Fredric March; &quot;Professional Soldier&quot; with Victor McLaglen and Gloria Stuart; &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; with Dolores Costello and C. Aubrey Smith; &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s of London&quot; with Madeleine Carroll and Tyrone Power; &quot;The Devil is a Sissy&quot; with Mickey Rooney and Jackie Cooper; and &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; with Spencer Tracy.

&quot;Captains Courageous&quot; was the movie on which he most enjoyed working. The film took an entire year to make, and much of it was shot off the coasts of Florida and Catalina Island, California. He recalled, &quot;For a kid, it was like one long outing. Spencer Tracy, Lionel Barrymore, Mickey Rooney, Melvyn Douglas and I; we all grew very close toward one another in those 12 months. When the shooting was finished, we cried like a bunch of babies as we said our goodbyes.&quot;

His acting skills, open and personable presence, emotional range, refined English diction, and angelic looks made him a box-office favorite. He quickly became the second-highest-paid child movie star, after Shirley Temple. Ring Lardner Jr. had high praise for him, saying of his performance as the star of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, &quot;He is on the screen almost constantly, and his performance is a valid characterization, which is almost unique in a child actor, and, indeed, in three fourths of adult motion-picture stars.&quot; Of his role as the protagonist of &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;, Frank Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Young Master Bartholomew ... plays Harvey faultlessly.&quot;

By April 1936, following the very popular &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, Bartholomew&#x27;s success and level of fame caused his long-estranged birth parents to attempt to gain custody of him and his fortune. A legal battle of nearly seven years ensued, resulting in nearly all the wealth that Bartholomew amassed being spent on attorneys&#x27; and court fees, and payouts to his birth parents and two sisters.

====MGM contract troubles====
The extreme financial drain of his birth parents&#x27; ongoing custody battles prompted Bartholomew&#x27;s aunt to demand a raise in his salary from MGM in July 1937, leveraged by the huge success of &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;. She threatened to break his MGM contract to find a better-paying studio. The contract battle kept him out of work for a year, causing, among other things, the postponement and eventual loss of his planned lead in a film of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Kim&quot;, and the loss of his planned lead in &quot;Thoroughbreds Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney.

He resumed acting in 1942, in mostly lesser-quality films and roles, only three of 11 of which were with MGM, and after 1938, he was less popular than in his heyday. The fall in popularity stemmed not only from the quality of the roles and his conflicts with MGM, but also from the fact that, by late 1938, he was a tall, nearly 6-foot teenager, and the fact that the world was focusing on the growing problems of World War II, thus the literary classics and costume dramas at which Bartholomew excelled were less in fashion.

In 1938, Twentieth Century Fox hired Bartholomew for the lead in its film of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. MGM teamed him for the fourth and fifth times with Mickey Rooney in &quot;Lord Jeff&quot; and &quot;A Yank at Eton&quot;, and he co-starred with Judy Garland in the lightweight MGM musical, &quot;Listen, Darling&quot; in 1938.

In 1939, Universal teamed him for the third and fourth times with Jackie Cooper in &quot;The Spirit of Culver&quot; and &quot;Two Bright Boys&quot;. For RKO distribution, he performed in &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; and &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; in 1940. As World War II deepened, Columbia had him star in three military-related films: &quot;Naval Academy&quot;, &quot;Cadets on Parade&quot; and &quot;Junior Army&quot;.

===World War II and beyond===

====Enlistment and aftermath====
World War II military service interrupted Bartholomew&#x27;s career even further. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces January 13, 1943, at age 18, and worked in aircraft maintenance. During training, he fell and injured his back, was hospitalized for seven months, and was discharged January 12, 1944.

He had one film role in 1944, in the low-budget comedy, &quot;The Town Went Wild&quot;. The film reunited him with Jimmy Lydon, with whom he had starred in &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, &quot;Naval Academy&quot; and &quot;Cadets on Parade&quot;. This ended up being Bartholomew&#x27;s penultimate film performance, and his last for seven years. His efforts to revive his film career were unsuccessful; and efforts performing in regional theaters and vaudeville did not spark a comeback either.

In 1946, after distressing experiences, including a devastating auto accident and performing unsuccessfully in a play in Los Angeles, Bartholomew married publicist Maely Daniele. Daniele, six years his senior, was a twice-divorced woman, and his marriage to her caused a serious and permanent rift with his aunt, who moved back to England. The marriage was not a happy one.

Also in 1946, he was in a radio play, in an episode of &quot;Inner Sanctum Mystery&quot;. In 1947, he appeared as himself in a five-minute cameo in the otherwise all-Black musical film, &quot;Sepia Cinderella&quot;, relating his post-war efforts to have a successful vaudeville routine and telling a few gags onscreen. He spent most of 1948 touring small American theaters, and in November 1948, left without his wife for an Australian tour as a nightclub singing, patter and piano act.

====Switch to television and off-camera work====
On his return to the United States in 1949, and in rather desperate circumstances, he switched to the new and burgeoning medium of television. He shifted from performer to television host and director to television producer and executive. Preferring to be known as Fred C. Bartholomew, he became the television director of independent television station WPIX in New York City from 1949 through 1954. His final acting role was as a priest in the 1951 film &quot;St. Benny the Dip&quot;.

He divorced his first wife in 1953, and in December of that year, he married television chef and author Aileen Paul, who he had met at WPIX. With her, he had a daughter, Kathleen Millicent Bartholomew, born in March 1956, and a son, Frederick R. Bartholomew, born in 1958. The family, including stepdaughter, Celia Ann Paul, lived in Leonia, New Jersey.
This was an era in which advertising firms created and produced radio and television shows. In 1954, Bartholomew began working for Benton &amp; Bowles, a New York advertising agency, as a television producer and director. At Benton &amp; Bowles, he produced shows, such as &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, and produced or directed several television soap operas, including &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;. In 1964, he became vice president of radio and television at the company.

Bartholomew and his second wife divorced by early 1977. He remarried in February 1976, and remained married to his third wife, Elizabeth Grabill, for the rest of his life.
==Illness, final years, and death==
Suffering from emphysema, he retired from television by the late 1980s. He moved with his family to Bradenton, Florida. In 1991, he was filmed in several interview segments for the documentary film, &quot;MGM: When the Lion Roars&quot;. He died of heart failure in Sarasota, Florida, in January 1992, at age 67.

==Mentions in popular culture==
The seven-minute Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;The Major Lied &#x27;Til Dawn&quot; (1938) includes a caricature of Bartholomew as his Little Lord Fauntleroy role.

He was also caricatured, along with many other Hollywood celebrities, in the eight-minute 1938 Disney cartoon &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot; – in this case as his character from the film &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;. As in the film, Freddie falls into the sea and is saved by Spencer Tracy&#x27;s character.

A non-alcoholic cocktail – a parallel of the Shirley Temple – which combines ginger ale with lime juice, known as a &quot;Freddie Bartholomew cocktail&quot;, is named for him.

Although his name is not mentioned, he is referred to in J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, as a figure whom Holden Caulfield looks like – specifically, Bartholomew&#x27;s most iconic role as Harvey Cheyne in &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937), referred to by the character Sunny as the kid in the movie &quot;who falls off [a] boat&quot;.

<doc id="1115032" wikidata="Q1962575" url="?curid=1115032" title="Everleigh, Wiltshire">
<text>Everleigh, pronounced and also sometimes spelt Everley, is a village and civil parish in east Wiltshire, England, about southeast of the town of Pewsey, towards the northeast of Salisbury Plain.

The village is also known as East Everleigh, to distinguish it from the hamlet of Lower Everleigh which lies about further west on the A342 road that connects Andover and Devizes. The village is surrounded by land known as Everleigh Drop Zone, owned by the Ministry of Defence that is used for military training as part of the Salisbury Plain Training Area.

==History==
The partly-forested area was known for recreational hunting. By the 13th century there was a deer park and a rabbit warren, and later activities included hare coursing, falconry and racehorse training. East Everleigh developed at a crossroads where the old Marlborough-Salisbury road (now only a track in the south of the parish) met the Devizes-Andover road (now the A342). In the 18th and 19th centuries, several inns provided refreshment and lodging.

The Everleigh estate was bought by Sir John Astley in 1765, and inherited in 1771 by his cousin Francis Dugdale Astley; it continued as the seat of the Astley baronets until the middle of the next century. Sir Francis made changes to the village layout around 1811, removing buildings which stood close to the manor house and diverting the road away from it. Those demolished included the old church (rebuilt by Sir Francis further west) and the &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; inn.

== Manor house ==
James VI and I and Anne of Denmark came from Wilton House to Everleigh on 31 August 1603 to visit Mr Sadler, a son of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Ambassador to Scotland, Sir Ralph Sadler.

The present Everleigh Manor was built in the 18th century, possibly on the site of the earlier house, and extended with east and west wings later in the century. In 1882 the central block was virtually reconstructed following a fire. It is a two-storey country house in brick and stone, originally five bays, extended to nine.

The Manor House was once a holding area for the prisoners during the Bloody Assizes with trials held by Judge Jeffreys in 1685. It was connected to a public house nearby, known as &quot;The Crown&quot;, by a tunnel where prisoners would be led to and from the court house and manor. The tunnel is now blocked up on either end of both the manor and public house, but the tunnel still exists to this day.

The manor house was bought by the National Deposit Friendly Society in 1921, for use as a convalescent home. The house was requisitioned in 1939 and, with new buildings added in its grounds, became a military hospital used by the US Army; there was also a vaccine laboratory. In 1951 the west wing was named the David Bruce Laboratory, and by this time the site was used by the Royal Army Medical Corps; the house and grounds were bought by the War Office in 1954. The Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map of 1958 shows many small buildings in the grounds to the northwest of the manor house.

The Army left the site c. 1990 and the house returned to use as a private residence. As of 2016, the west wing is operated as a hotel.

==Parish church==

Everleigh had a parish church by 1228, when it was granted to the Benedictine Wherwell Abbey in Hampshire. However, the mediaeval parish church was demolished in 1814 when the present Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was consecrated on a site about northwest of it. The present church was designed by the architect John Morlidge in a Georgian Gothic Revival style. It includes the original Norman font from the old church.

The Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre holds the parish registers for 1598 to 1971 (baptisms), 1598-1974 (marriages), and 1598-1984 (burials). The population in 1831 was 352, but by 1951 it had fallen to 264.

Rev. Prof. John Wallis (1675-1738), who was rector of Everleigh from 1716, was at the same time Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford. In the 1760s the living was held by John Butler, who was later Bishop of Oxford and Bishop of Hereford.

==Local government==
Everleigh is a civil parish with an elected parish council. The village is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

==Recreation==
The Orange Way long-distance footpath passes through Everleigh village in a southwest–northeast direction.

<doc id="1115033" wikidata="Q2744250" url="?curid=1115033" title="Cortana (Halo)">
<text>Cortana is a fictional artificially intelligent character in the &quot;Halo&quot; video game series. Voiced by Jen Taylor, she appears in &quot;&quot; and its sequels, &quot;Halo 2&quot;, &quot;Halo 3&quot;, &quot;Halo 4&quot;, &quot;Halo 5: Guardians and Halo Infinite&quot;. She also briefly appears in the prequel &quot;&quot;, as well as in several of the franchise&#x27;s novels, comics, and merchandise. During gameplay, Cortana provides backstory and tactical information to the player, who often assumes the role of Master Chief Petty Officer John-117. In the story, she is instrumental in preventing the activation of the Halo installations, which would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy.

Cortana&#x27;s original design was based on the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character&#x27;s holographic representation always takes the form of a woman. Game developer Bungie first introduced Cortana—and &quot;Halo&quot;—through the Cortana Letters, emails sent during &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;″s production in 1999.

The relationship between Cortana and Master Chief has been highlighted by reviewers as one of the most important parts of the &quot;Halo&quot; games&#x27; story. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth, as well as her sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft&#x27;s intelligent personal assistant of the same name.

==Overview==
Cortana is an artificial intelligence (AI) found in the &quot;Halo&quot; science fiction franchise. In the video games, Cortana often serves as an advisor and assistant to the player character, hacking alien computer systems and decoding transmissions. She speaks most of the first game&#x27;s dialogue, and serves as a talkative foil for the quieter Master Chief, as well as a way of relaying information and objectives to the player.

According to her backstory, Cortana was derived from the cloned brain of Dr. Catherine Halsey, the creator of the SPARTAN-II supersoldier project; Halsey&#x27;s synapses became the basis for Cortana&#x27;s processors. Cortana and other AIs are subject to a seven-year lifespan, after which they begin to dissemble and think themselves to death in a process known as rampancy.

As an artificial construct, Cortana has no physical form or being. Cortana speaks with a smooth female voice, and projects a holographic image of herself as a woman. Cortana is said to resemble Halsey, with a similar attitude &quot;unchecked by military and social protocol&quot;. In &quot;&quot;, Cortana is described as slender, with close-cropped hair and a skin hue that varies from navy blue to lavender, depending on her mood. Numbers and symbols flash across her form when she is thinking. Halsey sees Cortana as a teenage version of herself: smarter than her parents, always &quot;talking, learning, and eager to share her knowledge&quot;. Cortana is described as having a sardonic sense of humor and often cracks jokes or wryly comments, even during combat.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Cortana&#x27;s first game appearance is in the 2001 first-person shooter &quot;&quot;. Humanity is locked in a losing war with the alien Covenant. Cortana plots a course for the human ship &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot; to escape the Covenant. This heading leads to the discovery of a massive ringworld, Halo, built by a mysterious race known as the Forerunners. Cortana defends the ship from the Covenant until she is given to the supersoldier Master Chief to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Cortana helps direct human survivors scattered across the ring and assists the Master Chief in his missions. Inserted into Halo&#x27;s Control Room, Cortana realizes that the ring serves as a prison for the parasitic Flood; activating Halo would mean destroying all sentient life in the galaxy to prevent the Flood&#x27;s spread. Cortana assists Master Chief in destroying the ring and escaping.

In &quot;Halo 2&quot;, Cortana assists in the defense of Earth in the wake of a Covenant attack. Cortana, Chief and human forces travel to another Halo ring, Delta Halo, where Master Chief and Cortana encounter the Flood intelligence Gravemind. The Gravemind sends Chief and Cortana to the Covenant city-ship of &quot;High Charity&quot; to stop the Covenant from activating Halo; Cortana ultimately stays behind on &quot;High Charity&quot; to destroy the city and Halo should Master Chief fail in his mission. &quot;High Charity&quot; and Cortana are captured by the Flood. 

In &quot;Halo 3&quot;, Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions. On the Forerunner installation known as the Ark, the Master Chief travels through the ruins of &quot;High Charity&quot; to rescue Cortana. Chief and Cortana are successful at stopping the Flood, but become stranded in deep space aboard the human ship &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot;. Cortana activates a distress beacon, while Master Chief goes into cryonic sleep to await rescue.

At the beginning of &quot;Halo 4&quot; Cortana wakes the Chief as &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot; drifts towards a Forerunner installation called Requiem. Cortana begins displaying aberrant glitches and behavior, and reveals that she is suffering from rampancy as she has already exceeded her seven-year &quot;natural&quot; lifespan. She assists in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans. At the end, Cortana sacrifices herself to save the Chief and stop the Didact&#x27;s plan. Cortana&#x27;s survival is revealed in &quot;Halo 5&quot;, when she calls Master Chief to the Forerunner world Genesis. Cortana explains she survived the destruction of the Didact&#x27;s ship and her own rampancy by entering the Domain, an ancient repository of knowledge. Granted an infinite life span by the Domain, Cortana believes that she and other AI (the &quot;Created&quot;) should enforce peace through the galaxy. Cortana begins using ancient Forerunner constructs known as Guardians to enforce the Created&#x27;s will throughout the galaxy.

In &quot;Halo Infinite&quot;, Master Chief travels to the Zeta Halo and recovers the Weapon, a copy of Cortana designed to trap her for deletion. Traveling across a damaged Halo&#x27;s surface and fighting the Banished, the pair recover data fragments left behind by Cortana that fill in what occurred six months earlier; Cortana threatened the Banished leader Atriox, and destroyed his homeworld when he did not submit. Atriox uses the Weapon to capture Cortana and tries to force her to surrender Zeta Halo to him. Realizing her mistakes, Cortana destroys herself to damage the ring and stopped the Banished from using it. In a final message, Cortana apologizes to Chief for her actions and encourages him to work with the Weapon.

===Other appearances===
Cortana&#x27;s first appearance in the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise is in the novel &quot;&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which SPARTAN-II soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the Master Chief, whom she believes is her best match. Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief&#x27;s armor. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence in the files of Colonel Ackerson, the operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge. Cortana makes a small appearance in 2010&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, set shortly before the events of &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;. A fragment of Cortana carrying information gleaned from a Forerunner artifact combines with Cortana&#x27;s main self on &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot; before the ship escapes the planet, leading to the events of &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;.

Cortana also appears in the novelization of &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and the following novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as the animated series &quot;Halo Legends&quot; and live-action television series &quot;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn&quot;. She is also a main character in &quot;Human Weakness&quot;, a short story written by Karen Traviss for the &quot;Halo Evolutions&quot; anthology that details Cortana&#x27;s time in the clutches of the Gravemind.

She also appears in the &quot;Halo&quot; television series, created by Dr. Halsey as a means of keeping Master Chief and other Spartans in line. By cloning herself and then copying her clone&#x27;s brain patterns (which also kills her), Halsey is able to bring Cortana to life and then implant her directly into Master Chief&#x27;s neural pathways.

==Character design==
Cortana was developed to provide &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; with a way of guiding players while keeping missions open-ended, and avoiding players from feeling they were being herded through the game. Said story writer Joseph Staten, &quot;we needed a character who could consistently guide the player through the game, and an onboard AI was something that could always credibly accompany [them].&quot; Cortana&#x27;s role grew from pure gameplay considerations to serving as a way of characterizing and humanizing the Master Chief, and in subsequent games the Chief-Cortana relationship became a focus of characterization.

The character was designed and modeled by Bungie artist Chris Hughes, with the model&#x27;s face based on a sculpture of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti. Cortana&#x27;s name is a variant of Curtana, the sword used by the legendary Ogier the Dane, just as the titular AI character of Bungie&#x27;s previous game &quot;Marathon 2: Durandal&quot; is named after the legendary sword Durendal. Curtana&#x27;s inscription reveals that the sword has the same &quot;temper as Joyeuse and Durendal&quot;. After assuming development duties from Bungie, 343 Industries decided to explain Cortana&#x27;s established appearance as a reflection of her personality. &quot;So one of the reasons she [appears as she does] is to attract and demand attention,&quot; Franchise development coordinator Frank O&#x27;Connor explained. &quot;And she does it to put people off so that they&#x27;re on their guard when talking to her and she has the upper hand in those conversations.&quot;
Voice actress Jen Taylor voices Cortana in the majority of the character&#x27;s appearances. Despite her role in voicing other video game characters, including Princess Peach, she is not a gamer. Taylor was a college acquaintance of Joseph Staten, and he recommended her as a possible voice for Cortana to audio director Martin O&#x27;Donnell. When choosing a voice actor for the character, Bungie originally wanted Cortana to have a British accent. O&#x27;Donnell recalled that Taylor&#x27;s British accent was good, but felt it was too similar to her work for &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot;. The accent was dropped, but British colloquialisms remained in the character&#x27;s dialogue. Taylor recalled that a key directive from Bungie about the character was that she not come off as nagging, despite her role as the player&#x27;s guide and aid. &quot;They wanted her to be like the girl next door, your best friend that you want to hang out with,&quot; she said.

For years after the first game was released Taylor remained distanced from the character. She attended only one fan convention in six years after the release of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, and never saw many of the finished cutscenes with the character until a &quot;Halo 3&quot; launch party. Starting with &quot;Halo 3&quot;, Taylor felt the role involved more drama and less jargon, and over time, her relationship with the character changed. &quot;At first I was just excited to have a job and then I became more and more familiar, comfortable with and interested in her as she was developed,&quot; she recalled. &quot;And I&#x27;ve sort of fallen for Cortana as far as characters go. She&#x27;s remarkable.&quot; 

Cortana and the Master Chief&#x27;s relationship was a core part of &quot;Halo 4&quot;, part of a desire to feature a more human story. Creative director Josh Holmes noted that Cortana was in ways more human than Master Chief, and the idea that Chief would grapple with his humanity at the same time he was losing Cortana spoke to him. Holmes&#x27; mother was diagnosed with dementia during development, and his real-life struggles informed the characterization of Cortana&#x27;s descent into rampancy and the Chief-Cortana relationship. Holmes and the team drew inspiration from the relationship in the game &quot;Ico&quot;, where the main characters share a strong bond, as well as the many layers to the two characters&#x27; relationship; &quot;In some ways they’re friends, in some ways she’s almost like a mother, in others they’re skirting that line of lovers, and so all these different elements come into the relationship, making it complex and interesting to explore.&quot; For the first time in the series, Taylor performed her lines in the same room as Steve Downes, the voice of Master Chief. She credited the change for making the dialogue feel more authentic and real. Cortana&#x27;s new appearance for &quot;Halo 4&quot; was one of the game&#x27;s most dramatic changes. Early in production, concept artists created a variety of &quot;crazy ideas&quot; and explorations for how Cortana might look. Promising 2D designs were turned into simple 3D maquettes to prototype them in the game engine. Character artist Matt Aldridge recalled that Cortana was one of the hardest characters to envision in the game because of how beloved the character is by players; one of Aldridge&#x27;s goals was to create a character where scrolling lines of code would flow uninterrupted from her feet to her head. Art director Kenneth Scott was responsible for Cortana&#x27;s final design. The character&#x27;s motion capture was performed by Mackenzie Mason.

For &quot;Halo 5&quot;, Cortana&#x27;s appearance changes significantly. Describing her previous appearance as soft and &quot;deceptively vulnerable&quot;, 343 Industries took the story opportunity provided to change her look to reflect her new role as self-declared ruler of the galaxy. &quot;In the first draft of the ending she was going to wear a flowing gown, have long hair, etc. She&#x27;d be very regal, very “powerful high queen.&quot; Very obviously different than she was,&quot; writer Brian Reed recalled. Her final design incorporated elements of the Spartans and Forerunners on top of her previous look, including a Forerunner glyph. &quot;Having her wear [the Mantle] was a nice way of having her own it too, from a symbolic standpoint,&quot; Reed said. The character was modeled and animated using motion capture and talent at 343 Industries and Axis Animation. 343 Industries intended the character&#x27;s normal role in gameplay to be filled by Blue Team.

For the &quot;Halo&quot; television series&#x27; first season, Cortana was created digitally. Initially the character was to be portrayed by Natascha McElhone, who also plays Halsey in the series, but scheduling difficulties resulted in Jen Taylor taking on the voice acting and motion capture duties. The character&#x27;s more human and less blue appearance met with backlash after the series trailer released. Producer Kiki Wolfkill explained that the decision was influenced by the need to adapt the character to a live-action environment, and for her to feel real. For the second season, Cortana was portrayed by a live-action actress, Christina Bennington, as the producers felt they were missing on the subtle acting nuances with a digital character. Taylor still voiced the role, and she and Bennington collaborated on set to make sure the performances were in sync. Bennington credited Taylor for making her feel welcome in such a well-known role. The change in appearances was left unexplained in the show.

Bungie introduced the &quot;Halo&quot; series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, a series of cryptic email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie&#x27;s other game series. The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in &quot;I Love Bees&quot;, a promotion for &quot;Halo 2&quot;. Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks many of the same lines in &quot;Halo 3&quot;. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie&#x27;s director of cinematics, the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story.

Cortana is featured in a variety of &quot;Halo&quot; merchandise. The character&#x27;s first action figure was released as tie-in merchandise for &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;. McLees noted that the first action figure was supposed to convey an older appearance than was depicted in the games. This was accomplished by making the figure more buxom; despite McLees&#x27; request to revert the change, the sculptor was unwilling and time constraints left the design intact. The character is also featured in the first series of &quot;Halo 3&quot; action figures, distributed by McFarlane Toys, Funko vinyl figurines, and in a limited-edition silver-plated statue by Weta Workshop. &quot;IGN&quot; noted in 2016 that Cortana toys were lacking among &quot;Halo&quot;″s merchandising.

===Windows digital assistant===

Microsoft developed its virtual assistant for the Windows Phone operating system under the codename &quot;Cortana&quot; in reference to the &quot;Halo&quot; character. Though other final gender-neutral names for the final product were considered, positive developer and fan response to the leaked codename led to it becoming permanent. Deborah Harrison, one of Cortana&#x27;s &#x27;personality designers&#x27;, met with 343 Industries and added more confidence to the personality. &quot;As a result of the meetings we ended up coming back and baking this into the DNA of the digital assistant speech pattern, her approach to jokes and her approach to chit chat, and we decided to dial up her sense of self possession,&quot; Harrison recalled. Jen Taylor voiced the virtual assistant. Microsoft released a beta for Cortana in April 2014 with the developer release of Windows Phone 8.1. Microsoft also released Cortana virtual assistant on the Xbox One, Windows 10, iOS, and Android platforms.

==Reception==
Cortana is one of &quot;Halo&quot;″s most beloved characters, and has appeared in numerous lists of video game&#x27;s best sidekicks. &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot; named the character one of the greatest female characters for the character&#x27;s determination and fearlessness, which meshed perfectly with the game&#x27;s protagonist, while &quot;Glixel&quot; staff described Cortana as one of the most iconic video game characters of the 21st century. &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Megan Crouse called Cortana one of the &quot;Halo&quot; series&#x27; most important characters, and her relationship with her mother figure Halsey a relationship that was under-appreciated in much of the franchise. Professor Monica Evans called Cortana the most human character in the original game, and one of the most developed.

Cortana has also been recognized for her sex appeal; the character has been included on multiple lists of attractive video game characters. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian argues that Cortana had gotten increasingly sexualized in subsequent appearances; &quot;1UP.com&quot; noted that as Cortana&#x27;s sanity waned in the video games, her clothing appeared to decrease as well. &quot;Time&quot;″s Matt Peckham described Cortana&#x27;s character as a controversial figure, with a tension between being well-rounded character and being trapped as &quot;[an] adolescent male&#x27;s fantasy notion of a Campbellian hero figure,&quot; and that this tension had increased commensurately with the game series&#x27; graphical fidelity. Media critic Maddy Myers suggested that O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s explanation for Cortana&#x27;s look implies that the &quot;Halo&quot; universe&#x27;s futuristic setting still grapples with systemic sexism.

Mike Rougeau of &quot;Complex&quot; noted that &quot;Halo 3&quot; balanced a large conflict with a more personal one—that while the galaxy was imperiled by aliens, &quot;more important to fans was the rescue of Cortana.&quot; While Cortana&#x27;s role was greatly expanded in the game, &quot;Stuff.co.nz&quot; noted that the character &quot;has inexplicably had a sexy makeover&quot;. 

Despite mixed opinions of &quot;Halo 4&quot;″s campaign as a whole, Cortana and her story was often considered a strong point of the game. &quot;IGN&quot; called &quot;Halo 4&quot; &quot;really Cortana&#x27;s story&quot;, as saving the galaxy is of lesser importance to the Master Chief than saving Cortana, and Cortana&#x27;s humanity is ultimately the game&#x27;s focus. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s Tom Hoggins agreed, calling Cortana &quot;the flickering blue heart of the game&#x27;s plot&quot;, and Hoggins and reviewers for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; singled out the character&#x27;s writing and performance as high points of the game&#x27;s campaign. Justin Clouse wrote that the interactions between Chief and Cortana as the latter loses her hold on sanity were &quot;perhaps the best it&#x27;s ever been&quot;. &quot;Complex&quot;″s review praised the use of motion capture for Cortana, as they were given &quot;new life&quot; and new depth from the technology and performance.

David Their wrote that the choice for Cortana to return in &quot;Halo 5&quot; and turn her into an antagonist provided the game &quot;with a well earned sense of drive&quot; and that her appearance in &quot;Halo 5&quot; gave players another side of the character to see. &quot;There&#x27;s something unknowable about Cortana in her new role as AI God, but we&#x27;ve spent enough time with her throughout the series that we stick with her through the reinvention.&quot; Similarly, Patrick Dane of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; defended the game&#x27;s divisive campaign and Cortana&#x27;s turn to antagonist as an &quot;inspired choice&quot;, driving a wedge between the most important character relationship in the games. Conversely, Matt Peckham felt that the plot twist of Cortana&#x27;s actions &quot;feels strangely underwhelming&quot;, while &quot;Ars Technica&quot; and &quot;Kotaku&quot; considered Cortana&#x27;s return, and her plans to use alien technology to remake the galaxy, unbelievable and unearned. Responding to criticism that 343 had turned Cortana &quot;evil&quot;, franchise director Frank O&#x27;Connor said, &quot;my question back to them is, &#x27;What makes you say they’re evil?&#x27; Certainly a lot of our younger players are going to struggle with that subtlety, that nuance, because they’re expecting Darth Vader.&quot; Stephen Wilds of &quot;Polygon&quot; said that that &quot;there aren’t notable antagonists, but that they tend to disappear after a couple games&quot;, and wondered if Cortana could have been a &quot;full-fledged villain at the end of &quot;Halo 5&quot;&quot; and would be praised by fans.

<text>Ibrahim al-Makadmeh () (1952 – 8 March 2003) was a Palestinian and Hamas senior leader in the Gaza Strip who was killed by Israeli forces. Makadmeh, one of Hamas&#x27; founders and a leader of the group&#x27;s military wing, was accused of engineering several attacks that killed 28 Israelis.

==Biography==
Al-Makadmeh, age 52, was the father of seven children. He was a devoted preacher and political activist opposed to the Israeli occupation of Palestine. He was born in 1952, four years after his family fled from the village of Yibna, south-west of Jerusalem, when Israel was created. Al-Makadmeh&#x27;s family fled to the refugee camps at Bureij and later moved to Jabalia.

After graduating from secondary school in Jabalia, al-Makadmeh studied dentistry in Egypt where he adopted the Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood. When he returned to Gaza, al-Makadmeh began organizing the Palestinian Islamist movement and a few years later, he and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin founded Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic resistance movement.

In 1984, the Israelis arrested, charged and convicted al-Makadmeh with possessing and supplying arms to Palestinian militants. During his eight years in Israeli prisons he allegedly was subjected to physical and psychological torture.

In 1992, he was released from prison and began working as a dentist at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza while continuing his Hamas activities. His harsh criticisms of Palestinian Authority corruption and the Oslo Accords, as well as vocal support for Hamas attacks on Israel, led the Palestinian Authority to arrest him several times. He was detained for three years without charge or trial and allegedly was tortured in custody, this time by Palestinian authorities.

==Killing==
Al-Makadmeh and three of his aides were killed when three Israeli Apache helicopter gunships fired up to five missiles at the car he was in as it drove down a street in downtown Gaza City. Makadmeh&#x27;s killing came after Hamas claimed responsibility for an attack Friday on a Jewish settlement that left two dead, and a Haifa bus 37 massacre which killed 17 civilians.

According to family members, al-Makadmeh anticipated his killing by Israel for his leadership role in Hamas. A few days before his death, he said, &quot;Our homeland will not be liberated and our people will not be freed from Jewish enslavement and occupation without sacrifices. Freedom has a price, and the price is blood.&quot;

The Israel Defense Forces announced the killing saying that al-Makadmeh &quot;deserved liquidation&quot;, for &quot;masterminding terrorist activities against Israeli civilians and soldiers.&quot; A Hamas spokesman in Gaza dismissed the Israeli allegations as &quot;cheap lies&quot;, claiming that al-Makadmeh was a political leader.

Israeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz said that Israel would go after &quot;other leaders&quot; from Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

<doc id="1115036" wikidata="Q44923" url="?curid=1115036" title="Addis Ababa Bole International Airport">
<text>Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is an international airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is in the Bole district, southeast of the city centre and north of Bishoftu. The airport was formerly known as &quot;Haile Selassie I International Airport&quot;. It is the main hub of Ethiopian Airlines, the national airline that serves destinations in Ethiopia and throughout the African continent, as well as connections to Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The airport is also the base of the Ethiopian Aviation Academy. As of June 2018, nearly 380 flights per day were using the airport.

==History==
In 1960, Ethiopian Airlines realized the runway at Lideta was too short for its new jet aircraft, the Boeing 720. Thus a new airport was built at Bole.

By December 1962 the new runway and control tower were operational. In 1997, an expansion plan was announced for the airport. This expansion was done in three phases:

* Phase One: Adding a parallel runway and expanding the old runway.
* Phase Two: Construction of a brand new terminal with a large parking area, a shopping complex and restaurants.
* Phase Three: Construction of the control tower (double the height of the previous one) and installation of new electrical and fire-fighting equipment.

The expanded old runway and the new runway are capable of handling the Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 aircraft. The new parallel runway is connected by five entrances and exits to the old runway, which serves as a taxiway. The terminal houses a high tech security and baggage handling system built on more than 43,000 square meters of land. The terminal also has banks and duty-free shops. The new control tower was built in between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, replacing the old control tower.

In 2003, the new international passenger terminal was opened, making it one of Africa&#x27;s largest airport passenger terminals. The new terminal is capable of handling about 3,000 passengers an hour. This project was worth a total of 1.05 billion birr ($130 million). At the time, the airport was one of a number of airport terminal constructions that have been underway in Ethiopia.

In 2006, a new cargo terminal and maintenance hangar was opened five months late. This was because of expanded specifications to vastly improve Ethiopian Airlines&#x27; handling capacity and needs. The facility can accommodate three to four aircraft at a time. This project was worth a total of 340 million birr. At the same time, the first Airbus A380 arrived at the airport to undertake tests to validate its Engine Alliance GP7200 engines&#x27; performance from high-altitude airports. The airport is capable of accommodating the A380.

In 2010, the Ethiopian Airports Enterprise announced another expansion project worth $27.9 million at the airport. The project will include expansion of the aircraft parking capacity from 19 to 44 in order to accommodate heavier aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Boeing 777. In the first phase of the project, 15 parking stands will be constructed and the remaining will be completed in the next phase. The expansion will help in easing air traffic congestion due to an increase in international travel. This would lead to the new expansion plan in 2012.

===Expansion===

Expansion of the passenger terminal, cargo space, hangar, the runway and construction of the hotel is currently being completed by Singaporean companies.

The expansion work is being undertaken in two phases on an site. The first phase of the expansion work had enabled the airport to accommodate 15 additional aircraft, reducing traffic congestion at the airport. The second phase of the expansion work will enable the airport to service 10 additional aircraft. The airport will be able to service a total of 44 aircraft upon the completion of the expansion. The airport also plans to expand the apron which purportedly can solve the persistent aircraft parking problem it faces particularly during large international conferences.

In 2012, expansion of the new passenger terminal was announced. The outlay of this expansion was projected at $250 million. At the same time, a new ramp was completed and can now park 24 aircraft. Another ramp is being built for 14 more aircraft. At the same time, the first phase of expanding the taxiways and adding more aircraft parking was completed. Eventually, this will lead to the expansion of the terminal. This all falls in line with Ethiopian Airlines&#x27; plan, &quot;Vision 2025&quot;.

According to the CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, the east wing of the newly expanded airport was expected to be operational by the end of June 2018. The whole expansion project was completed by the end of 2018, enabling the airport to accommodate up to 22 million passengers per year. As of 23 Jan 2020 the extension is still not fully completed. The new check in area and the elevated road to it are not yet open.

On 27 January 2019, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed inaugurated the expansion to Terminal 2.

==Further developments==
Further expansion of the airport is currently underway, and the first phase of which is scheduled to be finished in 2029. When done, the expanded airport will reportedly have a capacity of 60 million passengers.

The former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn had purportedly given permission to build a new international airport in the town of Mojo, south of the capital&#x27;s current airport. The senior official at the Ethiopian Airport Enterprise said that the officials of the enterprise and the Ministry of Transport briefed the Prime Minister about the planned grand airport project. Two other sites were also options.

==Facilities==
The airport has two terminals with a total of 11 gates, plus more than 30 remote aircraft parking stands behind both Terminals. Terminal 1 has 4 gates and Terminal 2 has 7 gates. Terminal 1 serves domestic and regional flights for Ethiopian Airlines, EgyptAir, Qatar Airways, Sudan Airways, and Yemenia. Terminal 2 serves international flights and the rest of the airlines that serve the airport.

In 2012, Ethiopian Airlines opened the first phase of its Cloud Nine Business Class Lounge at Bole International Airport. This will provide premium travelers with modern facilities and amenities. The second phase of the lounge&#x27;s construction will include a spa, private digital lockers for passengers to stow away their bags, and a traditional Ethiopian coffee corner. Once complete, it will be three times the size of the existing lounge. Cloud Nine features a quiet corner with sleeping cots and individual reading lamps, massage chairs, and an internet corner with free Wi-Fi connection. The lounge is part of the airline&#x27;s &quot;Vision 2025 Fast Growth Plan&quot;.

In 2017, Ethiopian Airlines Group announced that it signed $350 million contract with China Communications Construction to build a new hub, a part of which will be open to the public no later than June 2018.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 18 April 1972 at 09:40, an East African Airways Super VC-10 (registered 5X-UVA) crashed during take-off; 35 passengers were killed, as well as eight of the 11 crew. 13 were injured, and 48 uninjured.
*On 18 March 1980, Douglas C-47B ET-AGM of Ethiopian Airlines crashed while on a single-engined approach to Bole International Airport. The aircraft was on a training flight.
*On 10 March 2019, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 of Ethiopian Airlines operating as Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 bound for Nairobi crashed shortly after takeoff from Bole International Airport. All 149 passengers and eight crew members on board perished. This crash was very similar to the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 five months earlier, as both planes were brand new 737 MAXs that crashed right after takeoff. Together, these two crashes led to the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX for nearly two years.

<doc id="1115044" wikidata="Q4249706" url="?curid=1115044" title="River Axe (Bristol Channel)">
<text>The River Axe is a river in South West England. The river is formed by water entering swallets in the limestone and rises from the ground at Wookey Hole Caves in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, and runs through a V-shaped valley. The geology of the area is limestone and the water reaches Wookey Hole in a series of underground channels that have eroded through the soluble limestone. The river mouth is in Weston Bay on the Bristol Channel.

The river was navigable from the Middle Ages until 1915, during early centuries of which seeing some European trade.

== Geography ==
The River Axe is formed by the water entering the cave systems and flows through the third and first chambers, from which it flows to the resurgence, through two sumps and long, where it leaves the cave and enters the open air. It is the second largest resurgence on Mendip, with an estimated catchment area of , and an average discharge of per second. Some of the water is allogenic in origin i.e. drained off non-limestone rocks, collecting as streams on the surface before sinking at or near the Lower Limestone Shale — Black Rock Limestone boundary, often through swallets. One such is Plantation Swallet near St Cuthbert&#x27;s lead works, between the Hunter&#x27;s Lodge Inn and Priddy Pools. It then passes through major cave systems such as Swildon&#x27;s Hole, Eastwater Cavern and St Cuthbert&#x27;s Swallet, around Priddy, but 95% is water that has percolated directly into the limestone.

From Wookey Hole village the river flows through a ravine and then west through the village of Wookey. There the river bifurcates: the ‘Lower River Axe’ runs more southerly, towards Henton onto Panborough Moor where it joins a series of rhynes and drains supplying water to local seasonal and perennial wetland, afterwards running north along the westernmost edge of Knowle Moor whilst the Axe proper continues west through the same moor. The two meet, to reunite, where Knowle and Panborough Moors meet.

The river then continues northwest past Wedmore Moor and through Oxmoor, Stoke Moor and Monk Moor. The river passes through the settlement of Lower Weare and on to the south of Loxton. From this point until it passes between Uphill Cliff and Brean Down, then reaches the coast at Weston Bay, the river demarcates Sedgemoor from North Somerset.

Tributaries of the Axe include three rivers called Yeo: the Cheddar Yeo, the Mark Yeo and the Lox Yeo.

== History ==
The name derives from a Common Brittonic word meaning &quot;abounding in fish&quot;, which is also the root for the River Axe in Lyme Bay as well as the Exe, Esk, Usk and other variants. The name is cognate with &quot;pysg&quot; (plural of &quot;pysgod&quot;), the Welsh word for fish.

The lower reaches of the Axe have a history of navigation from the harbour at Uphill through to the settlement of Weare. The current tidal limit of the Axe is the sluice gates at Bleadon and Brean Cross.

In the Middle Ages overseas trade was carried out from the port of Rackley, which is now north of the river as the course has been diverted. Rackley is now a farm below Crook Peak and west of Axbridge, which also had wharves. In the 14th century a French ship sailed up the river and by 1388 Thomas Tanner from Wells used Rackley to export cloth and corn to Portugal, and received iron and salt in exchange. Later slate was imported through this route and it may have still be possible to trade through Rackley until the act of 1915 authorising the drainage of the Axe and installation of the flood gate at Bleadon. Bleadon had been a small port, sometimes known as Lympsham Wharf, for many years, with the arrival of the railway in 1841 making this the furthest navigable point. It was last used by the ketch &quot;Democrat&quot; in 1942.

A series of 11 watermills were powered by the river but the only one which remains is at Burcott.

<doc id="1115045" wikidata="Q171857" url="?curid=1115045" title="Agra Fort">
<text>The Agra Fort (&quot;Qila Agra&quot;) is a historical fort in the city of Agra, also known as Agra&#x27;s Red Fort. Mughal emperor Humayun was crowned at this fort in 1530. It was later renovated by the Mughal emperor Akbar from 1565 and the present-day structure was completed in 1573. It served as the main residence of the rulers of the Mughal dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the &quot;Lal-Qila&quot; or &quot;Qila-i-Akbari&quot;. Before being captured by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its importance during Mughal rule. It is about northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city. It was later renovated by Shah Jahan.

Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud of Ghazni&#x27;s invasion is unclear. However, in the 15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Khan Lodi (1487–1517 CE) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the preexisting fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (1526 CE), Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In 1530 CE, Humayun was crowned in it. The fort was given its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (1556–1605 CE). Later, this fort was under the rule of Jats of Bharatpur for 13 years.

==History==
After the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri&#x27;s general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.
Realising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as &#x27;Badalgarh&#x27;. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.

It was only during the reign of Akbar&#x27;s grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. When Aurangzeb was victorious among his all brothers, then he imprisoned Shah Jahan in 1658 in the same fort only.

The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 years. In the fort, they built the &#x27;Ratan Singh ki Haveli&#x27;. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803. The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857 which caused the end of the British East India Company&#x27;s rule in India and led to a century of direct rule in India by Britain.
On 30 November 1871, thirty six people died when a cartridge factory located inside the fort exploded.

==Layout==

The fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river. Two of the fort&#x27;s gates are notable: the &quot;Delhi Gate&quot; and the &quot;Lahore Gate&quot;. The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the &quot;Amar Singh Gate,&quot; for Amar Singh Rathore.

The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar&#x27;s time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king&#x27;s formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (&quot;Elephant Gate&quot;) – guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders – added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort&#x27;s gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that is prevented by this layout.

The northern portion of the fort is still used by the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular), so the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.

The site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace – &quot;Bengali Mahal&quot;.

Akbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan. The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.

The Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal.

== Historical sites ==

* Jahangir&#x27;s Hauz (tank) (1610 AD): this monolithic tank (hauz) was used for bathing. It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as Hauz-e-Jahangir. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar&#x27;s palace. In 1843 AD and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar&#x27;s Bengali mahal.
* Shahjahani Mahal (1628–35 AD): it is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur&#x27;s baoli and a well are situated beneath it.

*Ghaznin Gate (1030 AD): the gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in 1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its weight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room. 
*Jahangir&#x27;s Chain of Justice (c. 1605 AD): this is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his &#x27;chain of justice&#x27;(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 AD. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, &quot;was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention&quot;. It was made of pure gold. It was 80&#x27; in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 AD. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir&#x27;s administration of justice &#x27;Adl-i-Jahangir&#x27; became a legend in Indian history.
*The Muthamman Burj (Shah-Burj) &amp; Jharokha (1632–1640 AD): this palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, every day at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his &#x27;Adl-i-Janjir&#x27;(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called &#x27;Muthamman Burj&#x27;. It has also been mentioned as &#x27;Shah-Burj&#x27;(the imperial or king&#x27;s tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or &#x27;Samman-Burj&#x27; as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632–1640 AD. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was &#x27;Durbar&#x27;. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the easternmost side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658–1666 AD) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.
*Shish Mahal (1631–40 AD): it was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi.

<text>In mathematical statistics, the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence (also called relative entropy and I-divergence), denoted formula_1, is a type of statistical distance: a measure of how much a model probability distribution is different from a true probability distribution . Mathematically, it is defined as

:formula_2

A simple interpretation of the KL divergence of from is the expected excess surprise from using as a model instead of when the actual distribution is . While it is a measure of how different two distributions are and is thus a &quot;distance&quot; in some sense, it is not actually a metric, which is the most familiar and formal type of distance. In particular, it is not symmetric in the two distributions (in contrast to variation of information), and does not satisfy the triangle inequality. Instead, in terms of information geometry, it is a type of divergence, a generalization of squared distance, and for certain classes of distributions (notably an exponential family), it satisfies a generalized Pythagorean theorem (which applies to squared distances).

Relative entropy is always a non-negative real number, with value 0 if and only if the two distributions in question are identical. It has diverse applications, both theoretical, such as characterizing the relative (Shannon) entropy in information systems, randomness in continuous time-series, and information gain when comparing statistical models of inference; and practical, such as applied statistics, fluid mechanics, neuroscience, bioinformatics, and machine learning.

== Introduction and context ==
Consider two probability distributions and . Usually, represents the data, the observations, or a measured probability distribution. Distribution represents instead a theory, a model, a description or an approximation of . The Kullback–Leibler divergence formula_1 is then interpreted as the average difference of the number of bits required for encoding samples of using a code optimized for rather than one optimized for . Note that the roles of and can be reversed in some situations where that is easier to compute, such as with the expectation–maximization algorithm (EM) and evidence lower bound (ELBO) computations.

== Etymology ==
The relative entropy was introduced by Solomon Kullback and Richard Leibler in as &quot;the mean information for discrimination between formula_4 and formula_5 per observation from formula_6&quot;, where one is comparing two probability measures formula_7, and formula_8 are the hypotheses that one is selecting from measure formula_7 (respectively). They denoted this by formula_10, and defined the &quot;&#x27;divergence&#x27; between formula_6 and formula_12&quot; as the symmetrized quantity formula_13, which had already been defined and used by Harold Jeffreys in 1948. In , the symmetrized form is again referred to as the &quot;divergence&quot;, and the relative entropies in each direction are referred to as a &quot;directed divergences&quot; between two distributions; Kullback preferred the term discrimination information. The term &quot;divergence&quot; is in contrast to a distance (metric), since the symmetrized divergence does not satisfy the triangle inequality. Numerous references to earlier uses of the symmetrized divergence and to other statistical distances are given in . The asymmetric &quot;directed divergence&quot; has come to be known as the Kullback–Leibler divergence, while the symmetrized &quot;divergence&quot; is now referred to as the Jeffreys divergence.

==Definition==
For discrete probability distributions and defined on the same sample space, formula_14 the relative entropy from to is defined to be
:formula_15

which is equivalent to

:formula_16

In other words, it is the expectation of the logarithmic difference between the probabilities and , where the expectation is taken using the probabilities .

Relative entropy is only defined in this way if, for all , formula_17 implies formula_18 (absolute continuity). Otherwise, it is often defined as but the value formula_19 is possible even if formula_20 everywhere, provided that formula_21 is infinite in extent. Analogous comments apply to the continuous and general measure cases defined below.

Whenever formula_22 is zero the contribution of the corresponding term is interpreted as zero because

:formula_23

For distributions and of a continuous random variable, relative entropy is defined to be the integral

:formula_24 

where and denote the probability densities of and .

More generally, if and are probability measures on a measurable space formula_14 and is absolutely continuous with respect to , then the relative entropy from to is defined as

:formula_26

where formula_27 is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of with respect to , i.e. the unique almost everywhere defined function on formula_21 such that formula_29 which exists because is absolutely continuous with respect to . Also we assume the expression on the right-hand side exists. Equivalently (by the chain rule), this can be written as

:formula_30

which is the entropy of relative to . Continuing in this case, if formula_31 is any measure on formula_32 for which densities and with formula_33 and formula_34 exist (meaning that and are both absolutely continuous with respect to formula_35), then the relative entropy from to is given as

:formula_36

Note that such a measure formula_31 for which densities can be defined always exists, since one can take formula_38 although in practice it will usually be one that in the context like counting measure for discrete distributions, or Lebesgue measure or a convenient variant thereof like Gaussian measure or the uniform measure on the sphere, Haar measure on a Lie group etc. for continuous distributions. 
The logarithms in these formulae are usually taken to base 2 if information is measured in units of bits, or to base if information is measured in nats. Most formulas involving relative entropy hold regardless of the base of the logarithm.

Various conventions exist for referring to formula_39 in words. Often it is referred to as the divergence &quot;between&quot; and , but this fails to convey the fundamental asymmetry in the relation. Sometimes, as in this article, it may be described as the divergence of &quot;from&quot; or as the divergence &quot;from&quot; &quot;to&quot; . This reflects the asymmetry in Bayesian inference, which starts &quot;from&quot; a prior and updates &quot;to&quot; the posterior . Another common way to refer to formula_39 is as the relative entropy of &quot;with respect to&quot; or the information gain from over .

==Basic example==

Kullback gives the following example (Table 2.1, Example 2.1). Let and be the distributions shown in the table and figure. is the distribution on the left side of the figure, a binomial distribution with formula_41 and formula_42. is the distribution on the right side of the figure, a discrete uniform distribution with the three possible outcomes (i.e. formula_43), each with probability formula_44.


Relative entropies formula_1 and formula_46 are calculated as follows. This example uses the natural log with base , designated to get results in nats (see units of information):

:formula_47

:formula_48

==Interpretations==
===Statistics===
In the field of statistics, the Neyman–Pearson lemma states that the most powerful way to distinguish between the two distributions and based on an observation (drawn from one of them) is through the log of the ratio of their likelihoods: formula_49. The KL divergence is the expected value of this statistic if is actually drawn from . Kullback motivated the statistic as an expected log likelihood ratio.

===Coding===
In the context of coding theory, formula_1 can be constructed by measuring the expected number of extra bits required to code samples from using a code optimized for rather than the code optimized for .

===Inference===
In the context of machine learning, formula_1 is often called the information gain achieved if would be used instead of which is currently used. By analogy with information theory, it is called the &quot;relative entropy&quot; of with respect to .

Expressed in the language of Bayesian inference, formula_1 is a measure of the information gained by revising one&#x27;s beliefs from the prior probability distribution to the posterior probability distribution . In other words, it is the amount of information lost when is used to approximate .

===Information geometry===
In applications, typically represents the &quot;true&quot; distribution of data, observations, or a precisely calculated theoretical distribution, while typically represents a theory, model, description, or approximation of . In order to find a distribution that is closest to , we can minimize the KL divergence and compute an information projection.

While it is a statistical distance, it is not a metric, the most familiar type of distance, but instead it is a divergence. While metrics are symmetric and generalize &quot;linear&quot; distance, satisfying the triangle inequality, divergences are asymmetric and generalize &quot;squared&quot; distance, in some cases satisfying a generalized Pythagorean theorem. In general formula_1 does not equal formula_46, and the asymmetry is an important part of the geometry. The infinitesimal form of relative entropy, specifically its Hessian, gives a metric tensor that equals the Fisher information metric; see . Fisher information metric on the certain probability distribution let determine the natural gradient for information-geometric optimization algorithms. Its quantum version is Fubini-study metric. Relative entropy satisfies a generalized Pythagorean theorem for exponential families (geometrically interpreted as dually flat manifolds), and this allows one to minimize relative entropy by geometric means, for example by information projection and in maximum likelihood estimation.

The relative entropy is the Bregman divergence generated by the negative entropy, but it is also of the form of an -divergence. For probabilities over a finite alphabet, it is unique in being a member of both of these classes of statistical divergences. The application of Bregman divergence can be found in mirror descent.

===Finance (game theory)===
Consider a growth-optimizing investor in a fair game with mutually exclusive outcomes 
(e.g. a “horse race” in which the official odds add up to one).
The rate of return expected by such an investor is equal to the relative entropy 
between the investor&#x27;s believed probabilities and the official odds.
This is a special case of a much more general connection between financial returns and divergence measures.

Financial risks are connected to formula_55 via information geometry. Investors&#x27; views, the prevailing market view, and risky scenarios form triangles on the relevant manifold of probability distributions. The shape of the triangles determines key financial risks (both qualitatively and quantitatively). For instance, obtuse triangles in which investors&#x27; views and risk scenarios appear on “opposite sides” relative to the market describe negative risks, acute triangles describe positive exposure, and the right-angled situation in the middle corresponds to zero risk. Extending this concept, relative entropy can be hypothetically utilised to identify the behaviour of informed investors, if one takes this to be represented by the magnitude and deviations away from the prior expectations of fund flows, for example.

==Motivation==

In information theory, the Kraft–McMillan theorem establishes that any directly decodable coding scheme for coding a message to identify one value formula_56 out of a set of possibilities can be seen as representing an implicit probability distribution formula_57 over , where formula_58 is the length of the code for formula_56 in bits. Therefore, relative entropy can be interpreted as the expected extra message-length per datum that must be communicated if a code that is optimal for a given (wrong) distribution is used, compared to using a code based on the true distribution : it is the &quot;excess&quot; entropy.

:formula_60

where formula_61 is the cross entropy of relative to and formula_62 is the entropy of (which is the same as the cross-entropy of P with itself).

The relative entropy formula_1 can be thought of geometrically as a statistical distance, a measure of how far the distribution is from the distribution . Geometrically it is a divergence: an asymmetric, generalized form of squared distance. The cross-entropy formula_64 is itself such a measurement (formally a loss function), but it cannot be thought of as a distance, since formula_65 is not zero. This can be fixed by subtracting formula_66 to make formula_1 agree more closely with our notion of distance, as the &quot;excess&quot; loss. The resulting function is asymmetric, and while this can be symmetrized (see ), the asymmetric form is more useful. See for more on the geometric interpretation.

Relative entropy relates to &quot;rate function&quot; in the theory of large deviations.

Arthur Hobson proved that relative entropy is the only measure of difference between probability distributions that satisfies some desired properties, which are the canonical extension to those appearing in a commonly used characterization of entropy. Consequently, mutual information is the only measure of mutual dependence that obeys certain related conditions, since it can be defined in terms of Kullback–Leibler divergence.

==Properties==

* Relative entropy is always non-negative, formula_68 a result known as Gibbs&#x27; inequality, with formula_69 equals zero if and only if formula_70 as measures.

In particular, if formula_71 and formula_72, then formula_73 formula_31-almost everywhere. The entropy formula_62 thus sets a minimum value for the cross-entropy formula_76, the expected number of bits required when using a code based on rather than ; and the Kullback–Leibler divergence therefore represents the expected number of extra bits that must be transmitted to identify a value drawn from , if a code is used corresponding to the probability distribution , rather than the &quot;true&quot; distribution .
* No upper-bound exists for the general case. However, it is shown that if and are two discrete probability distributions built by distributing the same discrete quantity, then the maximum value of formula_69 can be calculated.
* Relative entropy remains well-defined for continuous distributions, and furthermore is invariant under parameter transformations. For example, if a transformation is made from variable to variable formula_78, then, since formula_79 and formula_80 where formula_81 is the absolute value of the derivative or more generally of the Jacobian, the relative entropy may be rewritten: formula_82 where formula_83 and formula_84. Although it was assumed that the transformation was continuous, this need not be the case. This also shows that the relative entropy produces a dimensionally consistent quantity, since if is a dimensioned variable, formula_85 and formula_86 are also dimensioned, since e.g. formula_87 is dimensionless. The argument of the logarithmic term is and remains dimensionless, as it must. It can therefore be seen as in some ways a more fundamental quantity than some other properties in information theory (such as self-information or Shannon entropy), which can become undefined or negative for non-discrete probabilities.
* Relative entropy is additive for independent distributions in much the same way as Shannon entropy. If formula_88 are independent distributions, and formula_89, and likewise formula_90 for independent distributions formula_91 then formula_92
* Relative entropy formula_93 is convex in the pair of probability measures formula_94, i.e. if formula_95 and formula_96 are two pairs of probability measures then formula_97
* formula_1 may be Taylor expanded about its minimum (i.e. formula_99) as formula_100 which converges if and only if formula_101 almost surely w.r.t formula_102.

Denote formula_103 and note that formula_104. The first derivative of formula_105 may be derived and evaluated as follows
formula_106
Further derivatives may be derived and evaluated as follows
formula_107
Hence solving for formula_1 via the Taylor expansion of formula_105 about formula_110 evaluated at formula_111 yields
formula_112
formula_101 a.s. is a sufficient condition for convergence of the series by the following absolute convergence argument
formula_114
formula_101 a.s. is also a necessary condition for convergence of the series by the following proof by contradiction. Assume that formula_116 with measure strictly greater than formula_110. It then follows that there must exist some values formula_118, formula_119, and formula_120 such that formula_121 and formula_122 with measure formula_123. The previous proof of sufficiency demonstrated that the measure formula_124 component of the series where formula_101 is bounded, so we need only concern ourselves with the behavior of the measure formula_123 component of the series where formula_121. The absolute value of the formula_128th term of this component of the series is then lower bounded by formula_129, which is unbounded as formula_130, so the series diverges.
==Duality formula for variational inference==

The following result, due to Donsker and Varadhan, is known as Donsker and Varadhan&#x27;s variational formula.

== Examples ==
===Multivariate normal distributions===
Suppose that we have two multivariate normal distributions, with means formula_131 and with (non-singular) covariance matrices formula_132 If the two distributions have the same dimension, , then the relative entropy between the distributions is as follows:

:formula_133

The logarithm in the last term must be taken to base  since all terms apart from the last are base- logarithms of expressions that are either factors of the density function or otherwise arise naturally. The equation therefore gives a result measured in nats. Dividing the entire expression above by formula_134 yields the divergence in bits.

In a numerical implementation, it is helpful to express the result in terms of the Cholesky decompositions formula_135 such that formula_136 and formula_137. Then with and solutions to the triangular linear systems formula_138, and formula_139,

:formula_140

A special case, and a common quantity in variational inference, is the relative entropy between a diagonal multivariate normal, and a standard normal distribution (with zero mean and unit variance):

:formula_141

For two univariate normal distributions and the above simplifies to
:formula_142

In the case of co-centered normal distributions with formula_143, this simplifies to:

formula_144

===Uniform distributions===
Consider two uniform distributions, with the support of formula_145 enclosed within formula_146 (formula_147

Intuitively, the information gain to a times narrower uniform distribution contains formula_148 bits. This connects with the use of bits in computing, where formula_149 bits would be needed to identify one element of a long stream.

===Exponential family===
The exponential family of distribution is given by 

:formula_150

where formula_151 is reference measure, formula_152 is sufficient statistics, formula_153 is canonical natural parameters, and formula_154 is the log-partition function.

The KL divergence between two distributions formula_155 and formula_156 is given by

:formula_157

where formula_158 is the mean parameter of formula_155. 

For example, for the Poisson distribution with mean formula_160, the sufficient statistics formula_161, the natural parameter formula_162, and log partition function formula_163. As such, the divergence between two Poisson distributions with means formula_164 and formula_165 is 

:formula_166

As another example, for a normal distribution with unit variance formula_167, the sufficient statistics formula_161, the natural parameter formula_169, and log partition function formula_170. Thus, the divergence between two normal distributions formula_171 and formula_172 is 

:formula_173

As final example, the divergence between a normal distribution with unit variance formula_167 and a Poisson distribution with mean formula_160 is 

:formula_176

==Relation to metrics==

While relative entropy is a statistical distance, it is not a metric on the space of probability distributions, but instead it is a divergence. While metrics are symmetric and generalize &quot;linear&quot; distance, satisfying the triangle inequality, divergences are asymmetric in general and generalize &quot;squared&quot; distance, in some cases satisfying a generalized Pythagorean theorem. In general formula_1 does not equal formula_46, and while this can be symmetrized (see ), the asymmetry is an important part of the geometry.

It generates a topology on the space of probability distributions. More concretely, if formula_179 is a sequence of distributions such that

: formula_180,

then it is said that

: formula_181.

Pinsker&#x27;s inequality entails that

: formula_182,

where the latter stands for the usual convergence in total variation.

===Fisher information metric===
Relative entropy is directly related to the Fisher information metric. This can be made explicit as follows. Assume that the probability distributions and are both parameterized by some (possibly multi-dimensional) parameter formula_153. Consider then two close by values of formula_184 and formula_185 so that the parameter formula_153 differs by only a small amount from the parameter value formula_187. Specifically, up to first order one has (using the Einstein summation convention)
:formula_188

with formula_189 a small change of formula_153 in the direction, and formula_191 the corresponding rate of change in the probability distribution. Since relative entropy has an absolute minimum 0 for formula_70, i.e. formula_193, it changes only to &quot;second&quot; order in the small parameters formula_194. More formally, as for any minimum, the first derivatives of the divergence vanish

:formula_195

and by the Taylor expansion one has up to second order

:formula_196

where the Hessian matrix of the divergence

:formula_197

must be positive semidefinite. Letting formula_187 vary (and dropping the subindex 0) the Hessian formula_199 defines a (possibly degenerate) Riemannian metric on the parameter space, called the Fisher information metric.

==== Fisher information metric theorem ====
When formula_200 satisfies the following regularity conditions:

:formula_201 exist,
:formula_202

where is independent of 
: formula_203
then:
: formula_204

=== Variation of information ===
Another information-theoretic metric is variation of information, which is roughly a symmetrization of conditional entropy. It is a metric on the set of partitions of a discrete probability space.

===MAUVE Metric===
MAUVE is a measure of the statistical gap between two text distributions, such as the difference between text generated by a model and human-written text. This measure is computed using Kullback-Leibler divergences between the two distributions in a quantized embedding space of a foundation model.

==Relation to other quantities of information theory==
Many of the other quantities of information theory can be interpreted as applications of relative entropy to specific cases.

===Self-information===

The self-information, also known as the information content of a signal, random variable, or event is defined as the negative logarithm of the probability of the given outcome occurring.

When applied to a discrete random variable, the self-information can be represented as

:formula_205

is the relative entropy of the probability distribution formula_206 from a Kronecker delta representing certainty that formula_207 — i.e. the number of extra bits that must be transmitted to identify if only the probability distribution formula_206 is available to the receiver, not the fact that formula_207.

===Mutual information===
The mutual information,

:formula_210

is the relative entropy of the joint probability distribution formula_211 from the product formula_212 of the two marginal probability distributions — i.e. the expected number of extra bits that must be transmitted to identify and if they are coded using only their marginal distributions instead of the joint distribution. Equivalently, if the joint probability formula_211 &quot;is&quot; known, it is the expected number of extra bits that must on average be sent to identify if the value of is not already known to the receiver.

===Shannon entropy===
The Shannon entropy,

:formula_214

is the number of bits which would have to be transmitted to identify from equally likely possibilities, &quot;less&quot; the relative entropy of the uniform distribution on the random variates of , formula_215, from the true distribution formula_216 — i.e. &quot;less&quot; the expected number of bits saved, which would have had to be sent if the value of were coded according to the uniform distribution formula_215 rather than the true distribution formula_216. This definition of Shannon entropy forms the basis of E.T. Jaynes&#x27;s alternative generalization to continuous distributions, the limiting density of discrete points (as opposed to the usual differential entropy), which defines the continuous entropy as 
: formula_219
which is equivalent to:
: formula_220

===Conditional entropy===
The conditional entropy,

:formula_221

is the number of bits which would have to be transmitted to identify from equally likely possibilities, &quot;less&quot; the relative entropy of the product distribution formula_222 from the true joint distribution formula_211 — i.e. &quot;less&quot; the expected number of bits saved which would have had to be sent if the value of were coded according to the uniform distribution formula_215 rather than the conditional distribution formula_225 of given .

===Cross entropy===
When we have a set of possible events, coming from the distribution , we can encode them (with a lossless data compression) using entropy encoding. This compresses the data by replacing each fixed-length input symbol with a corresponding unique, variable-length, prefix-free code (e.g.: the events (A, B, C) with probabilities p = (1/2, 1/4, 1/4) can be encoded as the bits (0, 10, 11)). If we know the distribution in advance, we can devise an encoding that would be optimal (e.g.: using Huffman coding). Meaning the messages we encode will have the shortest length on average (assuming the encoded events are sampled from ), which will be equal to Shannon&#x27;s Entropy of (denoted as formula_226). However, if we use a different probability distribution () when creating the entropy encoding scheme, then a larger number of bits will be used (on average) to identify an event from a set of possibilities. This new (larger) number is measured by the cross entropy between and .

The cross entropy between two probability distributions ( and ) measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event from a set of possibilities, if a coding scheme is used based on a given probability distribution , rather than the &quot;true&quot; distribution . The cross entropy for two distributions and over the same probability space is thus defined as follows.

:formula_227

For explicit derivation of this, see the Motivation section above.

Under this scenario, relative entropies (kl-divergence) can be interpreted as the extra number of bits, on average, that are needed (beyond formula_226) for encoding the events because of using for constructing the encoding scheme instead of .

==Bayesian updating==
In Bayesian statistics, relative entropy can be used as a measure of the information gain in moving from a prior distribution to a posterior distribution: formula_229. If some new fact formula_230 is discovered, it can be used to update the posterior distribution for from formula_231 to a new posterior distribution formula_232 using Bayes&#x27; theorem:

:formula_233

This distribution has a new entropy:

:formula_234

which may be less than or greater than the original entropy formula_235. However, from the standpoint of the new probability distribution one can estimate that to have used the original code based on formula_231 instead of a new code based on formula_237 would have added an expected number of bits:

:formula_238

to the message length. This therefore represents the amount of useful information, or information gain, about , that has been learned by discovering formula_230.

If a further piece of data, formula_240, subsequently comes in, the probability distribution for can be updated further, to give a new best guess formula_241. If one reinvestigates the information gain for using formula_242 rather than formula_243, it turns out that it may be either greater or less than previously estimated:

:formula_244 may be ≤ or &gt; than formula_245

and so the combined information gain does &quot;not&quot; obey the triangle inequality:

:formula_246 may be &lt;, = or &gt; than formula_247

All one can say is that on &quot;average&quot;, averaging using formula_248, the two sides will average out.

===Bayesian experimental design===
A common goal in Bayesian experimental design is to maximise the expected relative entropy between the prior and the posterior. When posteriors are approximated to be Gaussian distributions, a design maximising the expected relative entropy is called Bayes d-optimal.

==Discrimination information==
Relative entropy formula_249 can also be interpreted as the expected discrimination information for formula_4 over formula_251: the mean information per sample for discriminating in favor of a hypothesis formula_4 against a hypothesis formula_251, when hypothesis formula_4 is true. Another name for this quantity, given to it by I. J. Good, is the expected weight of evidence for formula_4 over formula_251 to be expected from each sample.

The expected weight of evidence for formula_4 over formula_251 is not the same as the information gain expected per sample about the probability distribution formula_259 of the hypotheses,

:formula_260

Either of the two quantities can be used as a utility function in Bayesian experimental design, to choose an optimal next question to investigate: but they will in general lead to rather different experimental strategies.

On the entropy scale of &quot;information gain&quot; there is very little difference between near certainty and absolute certainty—coding according to a near certainty requires hardly any more bits than coding according to an absolute certainty. On the other hand, on the logit scale implied by weight of evidence, the difference between the two is enormous – infinite perhaps; this might reflect the difference between being almost sure (on a probabilistic level) that, say, the Riemann hypothesis is correct, compared to being certain that it is correct because one has a mathematical proof. These two different scales of loss function for uncertainty are &quot;both&quot; useful, according to how well each reflects the particular circumstances of the problem in question.

===Principle of minimum discrimination information===
The idea of relative entropy as discrimination information led Kullback to propose the Principle of (MDI): given new facts, a new distribution should be chosen which is as hard to discriminate from the original distribution formula_261 as possible; so that the new data produces as small an information gain formula_262 as possible.

For example, if one had a prior distribution formula_263 over and , and subsequently learnt the true distribution of was formula_264, then the relative entropy between the new joint distribution for and , formula_265, and the earlier prior distribution would be:

:formula_266

i.e. the sum of the relative entropy of formula_267 the prior distribution for from the updated distribution formula_264, plus the expected value (using the probability distribution formula_264) of the relative entropy of the prior conditional distribution formula_270 from the new conditional distribution formula_271. (Note that often the later expected value is called the &quot;conditional relative entropy&quot; (or &quot;conditional Kullback–Leibler divergence&quot;) and denoted by formula_272) This is minimized if formula_273 over the whole support of formula_264; and we note that this result incorporates Bayes&#x27; theorem, if the new distribution formula_264 is in fact a δ function representing certainty that has one particular value.

MDI can be seen as an extension of Laplace&#x27;s Principle of Insufficient Reason, and the Principle of Maximum Entropy of E.T. Jaynes. In particular, it is the natural extension of the principle of maximum entropy from discrete to continuous distributions, for which Shannon entropy ceases to be so useful (see &quot;differential entropy&quot;), but the relative entropy continues to be just as relevant.

In the engineering literature, MDI is sometimes called the Principle of Minimum Cross-Entropy (MCE) or Minxent for short. Minimising relative entropy from to with respect to is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy of and , since

:formula_276

which is appropriate if one is trying to choose an adequate approximation to . However, this is just as often &quot;not&quot; the task one is trying to achieve. Instead, just as often it is that is some fixed prior reference measure, and that one is attempting to optimise by minimising formula_277 subject to some constraint. This has led to some ambiguity in the literature, with some authors attempting to resolve the inconsistency by redefining cross-entropy to be formula_277, rather than formula_279 .

==Relationship to available work==

Surprisals add where probabilities multiply. The surprisal for an event of probability is defined as formula_280. If is formula_281 then surprisal is in formula_282nats, bits, or formula_283 so that, for instance, there are bits of surprisal for landing all &quot;heads&quot; on a toss of coins.

Best-guess states (e.g. for atoms in a gas) are inferred by maximizing the &quot;average surprisal&quot; (entropy) for a given set of control parameters (like pressure or volume ). This constrained entropy maximization, both classically and quantum mechanically, minimizes Gibbs availability in entropy units formula_284 where is a constrained multiplicity or partition function.

When temperature is fixed, free energy (formula_285) is also minimized. Thus if formula_286 and number of molecules are constant, the Helmholtz free energy formula_287 (where is energy and is entropy) is minimized as a system &quot;equilibrates.&quot; If and are held constant (say during processes in your body), the Gibbs free energy formula_288 is minimized instead. The change in free energy under these conditions is a measure of available work that might be done in the process. Thus available work for an ideal gas at constant temperature formula_289 and pressure formula_290 is formula_291 where formula_292 and formula_293 (see also Gibbs inequality).

More generally the work available relative to some ambient is obtained by multiplying ambient temperature formula_289 by relative entropy or &quot;net surprisal&quot; formula_295 defined as the average value of formula_296 where formula_297 is the probability of a given state under ambient conditions. For instance, the work available in equilibrating a monatomic ideal gas to ambient values of formula_298 and formula_289 is thus formula_300, where relative entropy

:formula_301

The resulting contours of constant relative entropy, shown at right for a mole of Argon at standard temperature and pressure, for example put limits on the conversion of hot to cold as in flame-powered air-conditioning or in the unpowered device to convert boiling-water to ice-water discussed here. Thus relative entropy measures thermodynamic availability in bits.

==Quantum information theory==
For density matrices and on a Hilbert space, the quantum relative entropy from to is defined to be

:formula_302

In quantum information science the minimum of formula_303 over all separable states can also be used as a measure of entanglement in the state .

==Relationship between models and reality==

Just as relative entropy of &quot;actual from ambient&quot; measures thermodynamic availability, relative entropy of &quot;reality from a model&quot; is also useful even if the only clues we have about reality are some experimental measurements. In the former case relative entropy describes &quot;distance to equilibrium&quot; or (when multiplied by ambient temperature) the amount of &quot;available work&quot;, while in the latter case it tells you about surprises that reality has up its sleeve or, in other words, &quot;how much the model has yet to learn&quot;.

Although this tool for evaluating models against systems that are accessible experimentally may be applied in any field, its application to selecting a statistical model via Akaike information criterion are particularly well described in papers and a book by Burnham and Anderson. In a nutshell the relative entropy of reality from a model may be estimated, to within a constant additive term, by a function of the deviations observed between data and the model&#x27;s predictions (like the mean squared deviation) . Estimates of such divergence for models that share the same additive term can in turn be used to select among models.

When trying to fit parametrized models to data there are various estimators which attempt to minimize relative entropy, such as maximum likelihood and maximum spacing estimators.

==Symmetrised divergence==

also considered the symmetrized function:

:formula_304

which they referred to as the &quot;divergence&quot;, though today the &quot;KL divergence&quot; refers to the asymmetric function (see for the evolution of the term). This function is symmetric and nonnegative, and had already been defined and used by Harold Jeffreys in 1948; it is accordingly called the Jeffreys divergence.

This quantity has sometimes been used for feature selection in classification problems, where and are the conditional pdfs of a feature under two different classes. In the Banking and Finance industries, this quantity is referred to as Population Stability Index (PSI), and is used to assess distributional shifts in model features through time.

An alternative is given via the formula_160-divergence,

:formula_306

which can be interpreted as the expected information gain about from discovering which probability distribution is drawn from, or , if they currently have probabilities formula_160 and formula_308 respectively. 

The value formula_309 gives the Jensen–Shannon divergence, defined by

:formula_310

where is the average of the two distributions,

:formula_311

We can also interpret formula_312 as the capacity of a noisy information channel with two inputs giving the output distributions and . The Jensen–Shannon divergence, like all -divergences, is &quot;locally&quot; proportional to the Fisher information metric. It is similar to the Hellinger metric (in the sense that it induces the same affine connection on a statistical manifold).

Furthermore, the Jensen–Shannon divergence can be generalized using abstract statistical M-mixtures relying on an abstract mean M.

==Relationship to other probability-distance measures==

There are many other important measures of probability distance. Some of these are particularly connected with relative entropy. For example:
* The total-variation distance, formula_313. This is connected to the divergence through Pinsker&#x27;s inequality: formula_314 Pinsker&#x27;s inequality is vacuous for any distributions where formula_315, since the total variation distance is at most . For such distributions, an alternative bound can be used, due to Bretagnolle and Huber (see, also, Tsybakov): formula_316
* The family of Rényi divergences generalize relative entropy. Depending on the value of a certain parameter, formula_317, various inequalities may be deduced.

Other notable measures of distance include the Hellinger distance, &quot;histogram intersection&quot;, &quot;Chi-squared statistic&quot;, &quot;quadratic form distance&quot;, &quot;match distance&quot;, &quot;Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance&quot;, and &quot;earth mover&#x27;s distance&quot;.

==Data differencing==

Just as &quot;absolute&quot; entropy serves as theoretical background for data &quot;compression&quot;, &quot;relative&quot; entropy serves as theoretical background for data &quot;differencing&quot; – the absolute entropy of a set of data in this sense being the data required to reconstruct it (minimum compressed size), while the relative entropy of a target set of data, given a source set of data, is the data required to reconstruct the target &quot;given&quot; the source (minimum size of a patch).

<doc id="1115079" wikidata="Q135501" url="?curid=1115079" title="Grafton Street">
<text>Grafton Street () is one of the two principal shopping streets in Dublin city centre — the other being Henry Street. It runs from St Stephen&#x27;s Green in the south (at the highest point of the street) to College Green in the north (the lowest point). 

The street, on the Southside of the city, was developed from a laneway in the early 1700s, and its line was shaped by the now-culverted River Steyne. Initially, a fashionable residential street with some commercial activity, the character of Grafton Street changed after it was connected to Carlisle Bridge and came to form part of a cross-city route. It suffered from dilapidation and prostitution through the 19th century, with several run-down buildings. During the 20th century, it became known for the coffee house Bewley&#x27;s, mid- and up-market shopping, and as a popular spot for buskers. It has been assessed as one of the most expensive main retail streets in the world on which to rent.

==Name==
The street was named after Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, the illegitimate grandson of King Charles II, who owned land in the area. His father, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, died on 9 October 1690 following the Siege of Cork. The second duke was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1721 to 1724.

==History==
===Early development===
The street was developed from an existing country lane, connecting College Green to St Stephen&#x27;s Green, which had been worked on by the Dawson family, after whom the parallel Dawson Street is named. It was developed and widened through the early 1700s, starting in 1708. Four years later, the city&#x27;s governing body, Dublin Corporation, approved development along the street in order to make a &quot;crown causeway&quot;. Its line was shaped by the short culverted River Steyne, which rises on one side of St Stephen&#x27;s Green and flows towards College Green and the Liffey near O&#x27;Connell Bridge. Development was largely complete by 1727.

From the beginning, the street held a mixture of residential and commercial development. Advertisements from the 1750s and 1760s describe first-floor apartments featuring a dining room, bedchamber and closet. The theatre manager Louis Du Val lived in Grafton Street in 1733, as did the novelist Charles Robert Maturin&#x27;s family. 

The street was largely rebuilt in the late 1700s, following the completion of Carlisle Bridge (now O&#x27;Connell Bridge) in 1758, spanning the River Liffey, when Grafton Street came to form part of an important north-south thoroughfare. Many of the remaining residences were redeveloped into shops, and several taverns were established along the street. This was supplemented by the widening and rebuilding which took place as part of the work of the Wide Streets Commission, from 1841. By the latter part of the 19th century, the street was primarily commercial in nature.

===19th century===

Throughout the 19th century, Grafton Street became increasingly dilapidated. By 1849, several buildings had broken windows that were patched up with paper. In 1862, the &quot;Dublin Builder&quot; said the street &quot;abounds in old premises in need of doctoring up.&quot; During the late 19th century, a number of retail properties were built and several long-standing businesses established their presence on the street, such as the department stores Switzer&#x27;s and Brown Thomas. The jewellers Weirs opened in 1869.

The street became known for prostitution during this time; in the 1870s, 1,500 prostitutes were reputed to work the street. This was part of a broader phenomenon − in 1870, there were 3,255 arrests for prostitution in Dublin, compared to 2,183 in London and 1,617 in Manchester. Despite complaints that the street was &quot;impassable to virtuous women&quot;, Dublin tourist guides continued to mention it as a fashionable place to visit. By the turn of the 20th century, prostitution had moved to the Montgomery Street (&quot;Monto&quot;) area on the northern side of the city, somewhat allowing Grafton Street&#x27;s reputation to recover.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1911, King George V and Queen Mary were led in a procession down Grafton Street which attracted thousands of onlookers. The American chain, Woolworth&#x27;s, opened a store on the street in 1914.

As part of a wider set of proposals to rename a number of Dublin streets in 1921, it was proposed that Grafton Street be renamed Grattan Street in the &quot;Report of the Paving Committee&quot; by the Dublin Corporation street naming committee. This new naming scheme was not fully implemented. Among the names retained alongside Grafton Street were North Earl Street and Talbot Street. This new name for Grafton Street had first been proposed by a columnist in &quot;The Irishman&quot; newspaper in 1862.

Woolworth&#x27;s moved to Nos. 65–68 in 1948. The first Irish McDonald&#x27;s restaurant opened on the street in 1977. This was followed by the opening of a number of other UK high-street businesses in the 1980s including HMV, Next, River Island, Miss Selfridge, and Marks &amp; Spencer. In 1987, a major fire broke out on Grafton Street in an employment agency above two shops. The fire quickly spread through the property, causing significant damage and closing the street. Five people were hospitalised for shock and smoke inhalation.

Several properties on the street were refurbished in the 1990s. No. 70 was extended in 1992, adding a limestone frontage on the ground floor. Numbers 84–86 were rebuilt the same year in a postmodern brick style.
In 2008, Grafton Street was the fifth most expensive main shopping street in the world, with rental pricing of €5,621/m2/year, and the thirteenth most expensive main shopping street in the world in 2016 at rental pricing of a much lower region of €3,300/m2/year.

====Pedestrianisation====
By the 1960s, Grafton Street had become congested with cars and buses, which caused serious pollution.
Pedestrianisation of the street was first trialled in September 1971, for a period of 4 weeks. After many delays, permanent pedestrianisation of most of the street was established in 1982, and the street was then repaved in 1988, with new street lighting also fitted. Objections to pedestrianisation came from councillors and small business owners, who alleged that it would lead to an increase in petty crime and antisocial behaviour. The northern end of the street, between Nassau Street and College Green, one side of which is occupied by the walls of Trinity College, is not pedestrianised.

==Properties==

Grafton Street has had a number of periods of redevelopment in its history, including in the 1860s, 1880s, early 1900s, and 1990s. On some occasions, the demolition of buildings led to the collapse of some of their neighbour&#x27;s. Altogether, this activity has resulted in a mixture of periods and styles, with few notable interiors or street surfaces extant. Some of the Georgian plot sizes and facades are still visible on some buildings, such as Nos. 31–33 and 63. No. 14 retains the window pattern of an early &quot;Dutch Billy&quot; house. At the north end of Grafton Street, surviving largely intact, is the Provost&#x27;s House, Trinity College, home to the head of the college and the University of Dublin.

The English Grammar School was founded at No. 75 Grafton Street in 1758, by Samuel Whyte, first cousin-in-law of the actor and impresario Thomas Sheridan. Students included Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Robert Emmet, Thomas Moore and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. It closed in 1824. Hodges Figgis first bookshop was at 104 Grafton Street, opening in 1797. It moved to its current location in Dawson Street in 1920.

Bewley&#x27;s Oriental Café opened on Grafton Street in 1927, on the site of Whyte&#x27;s Academy, and became a popular place to gather and socialise. In 2004, it was announced that Bewley&#x27;s Grafton Street and Westmoreland Street cafés would close, putting 243 jobs at risk. Following a campaign, the café on Grafton Street, which had closed, was reopened. Subject to a €1m redevelopment scheme in 2015, the café closed again following a collapse of trade during the COVID-19 pandemic. The then mayor, Tom Brabazon, expressed a hope that it might re-open after the pandemic.

==Monuments==
The northern end of the street was for many years the location of the Molly Malone statue, a well-known tourist attraction and meeting place. The statue was moved from Grafton Street to nearby Suffolk Street in 2014, to make way for an extension to the Luas tram system, which runs along the northern part of Grafton Street. 

A life-size bronze statue of Dublin musician and leader of Thin Lizzy, Phil Lynott, was unveiled on Harry Street, off Grafton Street near the Stephen&#x27;s Green end, in August 2005. In May 2013, the statue was tipped over by two vandals, who were subsequently arrested. In 2017, it was damaged after being hit by a truck, and spent several months in repair. The statue has become a well-known tourist attraction for music fans. In keeping with the tendency for Dubliners to nickname statues, it is known to locals as the &quot;Ace with the Bass&quot;.

Grafton Street is normally lit with Christmas lights during the festive season — in 2022, it was estimated that around 300,000 bulbs were used to illuminate the street. In 2019, a planned &quot;Nollaig Shona Duit&quot; (Irish for &quot;Happy Christmas&quot;) light display was cancelled and replaced with &quot;Grafton Quarter&quot; signage, causing controversy.

==Busking==

Since the 1980s, Grafton Street has become internationally known for its street entertainment, particularly busking. Musicians, poets and mime artists commonly perform to the shopping crowds. This was portrayed in the opening scene of the 2007 film &quot;Once&quot;, starring Glen Hansard of the Frames, a former Grafton Street busker. In Dublin, street performers must pay for a licence to busk (€30 per year as of 2019, plus €60 if using amplification), and on Grafton Street, each such performance is restricted to a maximum of one hour, and a musician cannot play within a distance of that location until the following day. Grafton Street has been the traditional home of the &quot;big busk&quot; on Christmas Eve, which aims to raise money for homeless charities.

Grafton Street buskers have included:

* Bono – lead singer of U2, has performed on Christmas Eve
* Paddy Casey – ex-Grafton Street busker and musician
* Mic Christopher – musician
* Dermot Kennedy - Irish singer-songwriter
* Keywest – English-Irish pop rock band based in Dublin
* Thom McGinty (&quot;The Diceman&quot;) – former street performer and actor, during the 1970s–1990s
* David McSavage – stand-up comedy and music, later television performer in &quot;The Savage Eye&quot;
* John Nee – imitated Charlie Chaplin
* Damien Rice – ex-Grafton Street busker
* Rodrigo y Gabriela – Mexican guitar-playing duo
* Allie Sherlock – YouTube singer, songwriter and guitarist
* Hudson Taylor – musical duo from Dublin

<text>May Ruth Snyder (née Brown; March 27, 1895 – January 12, 1928) was an American murderer. Her execution in the electric chair at New York&#x27;s Sing Sing Prison in 1928 for the murder of her husband, Albert Snyder, was recorded in a highly publicized photograph.

==Murder of Albert Snyder==
May Ruth Brown met Albert Edward Snyder (né Schneider) in 1915 in New York City, when she was 20 years old and he was a 33-year-old artist. The couple had little in common; Brown, who went by her middle name of Ruth to most people and was known as &quot;Tommy&quot; to close friends, was described as vivacious and gregarious, while Snyder was described as quiet and reserved and very much a &quot;homebody&quot;. Despite their differences in personalities and age, the couple married and settled in a modest house in Queens. In 1918, Ruth gave birth to their only child, a daughter named Lorraine. Albert Snyder was employed as an art editor for &quot;Motor Boating&quot; magazine, published for most of its run by William Randolph Hearst, and earned $100 per week.
In 1925, Ruth began an extramarital relationship with Henry Judd Gray, a married corset salesman who lived in the New Jersey suburbs. Ruth began planning the murder of her husband Albert, enlisting Gray&#x27;s help, but he was reluctant. Some claim that Ruth&#x27;s disdain for her husband apparently began when he insisted on hanging a portrait of his late fiancée Jessie Guischard on the wall of their first home and had named his boat after her. Guischard had died ten years earlier and Albert described her to his wife as &quot;the finest woman I have ever met&quot;. However, others have noted that Albert Snyder was emotionally and physically abusive, blaming Ruth for the birth of a daughter rather than a son, demanding a perfectly maintained home and physically assaulting both her and their daughter Lorraine when his demands were not met.

Ruth first persuaded Albert to purchase insurance, and with the assistance of an insurance agent (who was subsequently fired and sent to prison for forgery), &quot;signed&quot; a $48,000 life insurance policy with a double indemnity clause, paying extra if an unexpected act of violence killed the victim. According to Gray, Ruth had made at least seven attempts to kill Albert, all of which he survived. On March 20, 1927, the couple strangled Albert with a picture wire, stuffed his nose full of chloroform-soaked rags, and beat him with a sash weight, then staged his death as part of a burglary. Detectives who investigated the crime noted that there was little evidence that a burglar had actually broken into the house. Moreover, Ruth&#x27;s behavior was inconsistent with her story of a terrorized wife witnessing the violent murder of her husband.

Detectives discovered that the property Ruth had claimed had been stolen in the burglary had been hidden in the house. The real breakthrough came when a detective found a paper with the initials J.G. on it (it was a memento Albert had kept from former lover, Jessie Guischard). When asked by Detectives who &quot;J.G&quot; was, Ruth became flustered and instantly thought of Gray, whose initials were also J.G. She asked the detective what Gray had to do with the murder; it was the first time Gray had ever been mentioned, and the police immediately became suspicious. Gray was found in Syracuse, New York. He claimed he had been there all night, but it was determined that a friend of Gray&#x27;s had obtained a hotel room in Gray&#x27;s name to support his alibi. Under interrogation, Gray proved far more forthcoming than Ruth about his actions. He was arrested and returned to Queens. Both Gray and Ruth were charged with Albert&#x27;s murder.

===The trial===
Ruth and Gray turned on each other, contending the other was responsible for killing Albert; both were convicted and sentenced to death.

===Execution===
Ruth was imprisoned at Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. On January 12, 1928, she became the first woman to be executed at Sing Sing since Martha Place in 1899 and the third woman to be executed in New York. Ruth went to the electric chair 10 minutes before Judd Gray, her former lover. Her execution was surreptitiously photographed at the moment electricity was running through her body with the aid of a miniature plate camera strapped to the ankle of Tom Howard, a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; photographer working in cooperation with the &quot;Tribune&quot;-owned &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. Both Snyder and Gray were electrocuted by Robert G. Elliott, the New York State Electrician; Snyder was the first woman he executed. In his autobiography, Elliott recalled that Ruth Snyder almost fainted when she saw the electric chair and that she had to be seated with the help of the matrons who had taken care of her while on death row. About the published photo of Snyder&#x27;s execution, Elliott remarked that if such photos were routinely printed in newspapers they either could have served as a deterrent against crime or have persuaded the public that capital punishment had to be abolished.

Ruth was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. Gray was interred in Rosedale Cemetery in Montclair, New Jersey.

==Lorraine Snyder==

Following the pronouncement of the death sentence on Ruth Snyder in May 1927, legal disputes arose between the relatives regarding the care of Ruth and Albert&#x27;s daughter, Lorraine, who was nine years old at the time. Warren Schneider, brother of Albert, petitioned to be allowed to appoint a legal guardian who was not a member of Ruth&#x27;s family. Josephine Brown, mother of Ruth, also petitioned for custody of the girl. Lorraine had been in the care of Brown since the murder. Lorraine was formally placed by her maternal grandmother in the Catholic institution where she had been residing at the time of her mother&#x27;s execution. Ruth requested that her daughter not be brought to the prison for a final visit.

On September 7, 1927, Josephine Brown was awarded guardianship of the girl. During this time, there were disputes with the insurance company Ruth had used to insure her husband&#x27;s life. Although one policy, worth US$30,000, to Gray&#x27;s daughter, was paid without contest, it filed suit to void two other policies, worth $45,000 and $5,000 (the three combined policies worth $ million in ). By May 1928, the insurance company made available $4,000 for the maintenance of Lorraine. In November 1928 a ruling in the case was reached, with a court finding the policies could not be collected because they had been issued fraudulently. At the time of the judgment, the lawyer acting on behalf of Ruth&#x27;s family asked the court to allow them to appeal without a printed record on the basis that the family was destitute and unable to sell the house due to the notoriety of the case. By May 1930, it was ruled on appeal that the two policies were invalid.

While incarcerated on death row, Ruth Snyder wrote a sealed letter that she requested be given to Lorraine &quot;when she is old enough to understand&quot;. One year after her mother&#x27;s execution, Lorraine was apparently aware that her parents were both dead, but not of the manner of either of their deaths.

<doc id="1115083" wikidata="Q941696" url="?curid=1115083" title="Chew Stoke">
<text>Chew Stoke is a small village and civil parish in the affluent Chew Valley, in Somerset, England, about south of Bristol and 10 miles north of Wells. It is at the northern edge of the Mendip Hills, a region designated by the United Kingdom as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and is within the Bristol and Bath green belt. The parish includes the hamlet of Breach Hill, which is approximately southwest of Chew Stoke itself.

Chew Stoke has a long history, as shown by the number and range of its heritage-listed buildings. The village is at the northern end of Chew Valley Lake, which was created in the 1950s, close to a dam, pumping station, sailing club, and fishing lodge. A tributary of the River Chew, which rises in Strode, runs through the village.

The population of 1,038 is served by one shop, one working public house, a primary school and a bowling club. Together with Chew Magna, it forms the ward of Chew Valley North in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset. Chew Valley School and its associated leisure centre are less than a mile (1.6 km) from Chew Stoke. The village has some areas of light industry but is largely agricultural; many residents commute to nearby cities for employment.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Archaeological excavations carried out between 1953 and 1955 by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield from the Ministry of Works found evidence of extensive human occupation of the area. Consecutive habitation, spanning thousands of years from the Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods (Old, Middle, and New Stone Age), to the Bronze and Iron Ages had left numerous artefacts behind. Discoveries have included stone knives, flint blades, and the head of a mace, along with buildings and graves.

=== Romano-Celtic temple ===

Chew Stoke is the site of a Romano-Celtic double-octagonal temple, possibly dedicated to the god Mercury. The temple, on Pagans Hill, was excavated by Philip Rahtz between 1949 and 1951. It consisted of an inner wall, which formed the sanctuary, surrounded by an outer wall forming an ambulatory, or covered walkway across. It was first built in the late 3rd century but was twice rebuilt, finally collapsing in the 5th century. The positioning of the temple on what is now known as Pagans Hill may seem apt, but there is no evidence for any link between the existence of the temple and the naming of the road.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the Middle Ages, farming was the most important activity in the area, and farming, both arable and dairy, continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, pears, and plums. Evidence exists of lime kilns, used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Chew Stoke was listed as &quot;Chiwestoche&quot;, and was recorded as belonging to Gilbert fitz Turold. He conspired with Robert Curthose, the Duke of Normandy, against King William Rufus, and subsequently all his lands were seized. The next recorded owner was Lord Beauchamp of Hache. He became &quot;lord of the manor&quot; when the earls of Gloucester, with hereditary rights to Chew Stoke, surrendered them to him. According to Stephen Robinson, the author of &quot;Somerset Place Names&quot;, the village was then known as &quot;Chew Millitus&quot;, suggesting that it may have had some military potential. The name &quot;Stoke&quot;, from the old English &quot;stoc&quot;, meaning a stockade, may support that idea.

The parish was part of the hundred of Chew.

=== Bilbie family of bell and clockmakers ===
The Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers lived and worked in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They produced more than 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all over the West Country. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local St Andrew&#x27;s Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.

=== Recent history ===
In the 20th century, Chew Stoke expanded slightly with the influx of residents from the Chew Valley Lake area. These new residents were moved to Chew Stoke when the lake was created in the 1950s. In World War II, 42 children and three teachers, who had been evacuated from Avenmore school in London, were accommodated in the village. On 10 July 1968, torrential rainfall, with falling in 18 hours on Chew Stoke, double the area&#x27;s average rainfall for the whole of July, led to widespread flooding in the Chew Valley, and water reached the first floor of many buildings. The damage in Chew Stoke was not as severe as in some of the surrounding villages, such as Pensford; however, fears that the Chew Valley Lake dam would be breached caused considerable anxiety.
On 4 February 2001, Princess Anne opened the Rural Housing Trust development at Salway Close. Each year, over a weekend in September (usually the first), a &quot;Harvest Home&quot; is held with horse and pet shows, bands, a funfair, and other entertainments. The Harvest Home was cancelled in 1997 as a mark of respect following the death of Princess Diana in the previous week. The Radford&#x27;s factory site, where refrigeration equipment was formerly manufactured, was identified as a brownfield site suitable for residential development in the 2002 Draft Local Plan of Bath and North East Somerset. That plan has generated controversy about balancing land use to meet residential, social, and employment needs.

During November 2012 a series of floods affected many parts of Britain. On 22 November a man died after his car was washed down a flooded brook in Chew Stoke and trapped against a small bridge.

== Governance ==

Chew Stoke has its own nine-member parish council with responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village is part of the ward of Chew Valley in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, which has the wider responsibility for providing services such as education, refuse collection, and tourism. The ward is currently represented by Councillors Anna Box and David Harding, members of the Liberal Democrats. It is also part of the North East Somerset and Hanham, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020.

The police service is provided by Avon and Somerset Constabulary with two Community Support Officer and one police officer covering the wider Chew Valley area. The Avon Fire and Rescue Service have a fire station at Chew Magna.

== Geography ==

The area of Chew Stoke is surrounded by arable land and dairy farms on the floor of the Chew Valley. It is located along the Strode Brook tributary of the River Chew, on the northwest side of the Chew Valley Lake. While much of the area has been cleared for farming, trees line the tributary and many of the roads. The village is built along the main thoroughfare, Bristol Road, which runs northeast to southwest. An older centre is located along Pilgrims Way, which loops onto Bristol Road and features an old stone packhorse bridge—now pedestrianised—and a 1950s Irish bridge, used as a ford in winter. The bridge is wide and has parapets. Houses line both of these roads, with residential cul-de-sacs and lanes extending from them.

Chew Stoke is approximately south of Bristol, north of Wells, west of Bath, east of Weston-super-Mare, and southwest of Keynsham. It is south of Chew Magna on the B3130 road that joins the A37 and A38. The A368 crosses the valley west of the lake. The &quot;Chew Valley Explorer&quot; bus route 672/674, running from Bristol Bus Station to Cheddar, provides public transport access. This service is operated by CT coaches and Eurotaxis and subsidised by Bath and North East Somerset council. In 2002, a cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, was opened around the western part of the lake from Chew Stoke. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3. It has all-weather surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors, and cyclists of all abilities. Funding was provided by Bath and North East Somerset Council, with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. The minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists. Bristol Airport is approximately away, and the nearest train stations are Keynsham, Bath Spa, and Bristol Temple Meads.

== Demography ==
The population of Chew Stoke, according to the census of 1801, was 517. This number increased slowly during the 19th century to a maximum of 819 but fell to around 600 by the end of the century. The population remained fairly stable until World War II. During the latter half of the 20th century, the population of the village rose to 905 people. Data for 1801–1971 is available at Britain Through Time;
data for 1971–2001 is available from BANES(2011 Census) The 2001 Census gives detailed information about the Chew Valley North ward, which includes both Chew Magna and Chew Stoke. The ward had 2,307 residents, living in 911 households, with an average age of 42.3 years. Of those, 77% of residents described their health as &#x27;good&#x27;, 21% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no work qualifications, and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.3%. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, the ward was ranked at 26,243 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived and 32,482 the least deprived. A small number of light industrial/craft premises exist at &quot;Fairseat Workshops&quot;, formerly the site of a dairy. However, they provide little employment, and many residents commute to jobs in nearby cities. The population has increased since; in the 2011 census there were 991 residents recorded, and 1,038 in the 2021 census.
== Landmarks ==
=== St Andrew&#x27;s Church ===

St Andrew&#x27;s Church, a Grade II* listed building on the outskirts of Chew Stoke, was constructed in the 15th century and underwent extensive renovation in 1862. The inside of the church is decorated with 156 angels in wood and stone, and the church includes a tower with an unusual spirelet on the staircase turret. In the tower hang bells cast by the Bilbie family.
The reconstructed Moreton Cross in the churchyard was moved there when Chew Valley Lake was flooded, and the base of the cross shaft, about southwest of the tower, is thought to date from the 14th century and is itself a Grade II* listed building, as is the Webb monument in the churchyard. The churchyard gate, at the southeast entrance, bears a lamp provided by public subscription to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Jubilee of 1897 and is a Grade II listed structure.

In the church are bronze plaques commemorating the eleven local people who died in World War I and the six who were killed in World War II. There is also a stained glass window showing a saint with a sword standing on a snake, and crossed flags commemorating those from World War II. There is also a memorial plaque to the local Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers inside the church, and just inside the porch, on the left of the church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor, which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the flooding of the lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court, by Queen Elizabeth I.

=== Rectory ===
The Rectory, at the end of Church Lane, opposite the church hall, is believed to have been built in 1529 by Sir John Barry, rector 1524–46. It has since undergone substantial renovations, including the addition of a clock tower for the Rev. W.P. Wait and further alterations c.1876 for Rev. J. Ellershaw. The clock tower has since been removed. The building has an ornate south front with carvings of shields bearing the coat of arms of the St Loe family, who were once chief landowners in the area, alone or impaled with arms of Fitzpane, Ancell, de la Rivere, and Malet. It is Grade II* listed.

=== New rectory ===

The Reverend John Ellershaw built the new rectory in the 1870s. The last rector to occupy it was Lionel St Clair Waldy from 1907 to 1945. It was then bought by Douglas Wills, who donated it and the rectory field to Winford Hospital as a convalescent home for 16 children. It was later used as a nurses&#x27; home before being sold for private use.
It is now split into several residential units.

=== Grade II listed buildings ===
As with many cities and towns in the United Kingdom, the age of a number of the buildings in Chew Stoke, including the church, school, and several houses, reflects the long history of the village. For example, Chew Stoke School has approximately 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old. After the age of 11, most pupils either attend Chew Valley School or any of the independent schools in the area. These two buildings were built in 1858 on the site of a former charity school founded in 1718. The architect was S.B. Gabriel of Bristol. Additional classrooms were built in 1926, and further alterations and extensions were carried out in 1970.

An obelisk on Breach Hill Lane, dating from the early-to-mid-19th century, is said to have been built as a waterworks marker. It has a square limestone plinth about high. The obelisk is about high with a pyramidal top and small opening at the top on two sides.
The importance of farming is reflected in the age of many of the farmhouses. Manor Farm, on Scot Lane (not to be confused with at least two other Manor Farms in the locality) is thought to date from 1495 and, as such, is probably the oldest building in the village. Presently (2007) occupied by Mr and Mrs Slater; the building has recently (2002) undergone a sympathetic extension to incorporate an old semi-derelict barn onto the main house for use as a garage and workshop. Mr Slater, a Chartered Engineer, is interested in bringing the art of clock making back to the village. Rookery Farmhouse, in Breach Hill Lane, is dated at 1720, with later 18th century additions to either side of the central rear wing.
An attached stable, northeast of the farmhouse, is also a Grade II listed building.
School Farmhouse, in School Lane, dates from the late 17th century and has a studded oak door in the side of the house.
Wallis Farmhouse, farther along School Lane, is dated at 1782.
Yew Tree Farmhouse, one of the oldest buildings in the area, is a cruck built farmhouse of which there are very few in North Somerset. It was included in the dendrochronology project carried out by the Somerset Vernacular Building Research Group 1996–1998 and the crucks gave a felling date of 1386, the house has been extensively altered and added to over later centuries.
North Hill Farmhouse also has 15th century origins.
Paganshill Farmhouse dates from the 17th century.
Fairseat Farmhouse is from the 18th century and includes a plaque recording that John Wesley preached at the house on 10 September 1790. In August of that year, Fairseat Farmhouse was &quot;registered among the records of this County as a House set apart for the worship of God and religious exercise for Protestant Dissenters.&quot; At that time the house belonged to Anna Maria Griffon. In the garden is a large evergreen oak (&quot;Ilex&quot;) which measured across until half of it broke away in a gale in 1976.

The Methodist Chapel was built in 1815/16 after religious services had been established at Fairseat Farm, and the chapel was rebuilt in the late 19th century with limestone walls with stone dressings and a slate hipped roof with brick eaves stacks and crestings.

In the hamlet of Stoke Villice, which is south of the main village, there is a 19th-century milestone inscribed &quot;8 miles to Bristol&quot; that also has listed status.

== Education ==
Chew Stoke Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School serves the village itself and surrounding villages in the Chew Valley. It is a Church of England voluntary controlled school linked with the St. Andrew&#x27;s parish church. It has about 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old. After the age of 11, most pupils attend Chew Valley School.

The school was founded as a charity in 1718 making it one of the oldest schools in Somerset. Its original buildings were demolished in 1858 and replaced with new ones to designs by S.B. Gabriel that are now Grade II listed. The school bell was donated by the Bilbie family of bell founders based in the village. Additional classrooms were built in 1926, and further alterations and extensions were built in 1970, 1995 and 2001.

In July 2018, the school celebrated its 300th birthday making it one of the oldest state schools in England. A service was held at St Andrew&#x27;s Church led by the Bishop of Taunton – The Right Reverend Ruth Worsley, and was followed by a tea party at the school, and the planting of a time capsule.

<text>A magnetic circuit is made up of one or more closed loop paths containing a magnetic flux. The flux is usually generated by permanent magnets or electromagnets and confined to the path by magnetic cores consisting of ferromagnetic materials like iron, although there may be air gaps or other materials in the path. Magnetic circuits are employed to efficiently channel magnetic fields in many devices such as electric motors, generators, transformers, relays, lifting electromagnets, SQUIDs, galvanometers, and magnetic recording heads.

The relation between magnetic flux, magnetomotive force, and magnetic reluctance in an unsaturated magnetic circuit can be described by Hopkinson&#x27;s law, which bears a superficial resemblance to Ohm&#x27;s law in electrical circuits, resulting in a one-to-one correspondence between properties of a magnetic circuit and an analogous electric circuit. Using this concept the magnetic fields of complex devices such as transformers can be quickly solved using the methods and techniques developed for electrical circuits.

Some examples of magnetic circuits are:
* horseshoe magnet with iron keeper (low-reluctance circuit)
* horseshoe magnet with no keeper (high-reluctance circuit)
* electric motor (variable-reluctance circuit)
* some types of pickup cartridge (variable-reluctance circuits)

==Magnetomotive force (MMF)==
Similar to the way that electromotive force (EMF) drives a current of electrical charge in electrical circuits, magnetomotive force (MMF) &#x27;drives&#x27; magnetic flux through magnetic circuits. The term &#x27;magnetomotive force&#x27;, though, is a misnomer since it is not a force nor is anything moving. It is perhaps better to call it simply MMF. In analogy to the definition of EMF, the magnetomotive force formula_1 around a closed loop is defined as:

:formula_2

The MMF represents the potential that a hypothetical magnetic charge would gain by completing the loop. The magnetic flux that is driven is not a current of magnetic charge; it merely has the same relationship to MMF that electric current has to EMF. (See microscopic origins of reluctance below for a further description.)

The unit of magnetomotive force is the ampere-turn (At), represented by a steady, direct electric current of one ampere flowing in a single-turn loop of electrically conducting material in a vacuum. The gilbert (Gb), established by the IEC in 1930, is the CGS unit of magnetomotive force and is a slightly smaller unit than the ampere-turn. The unit is named after William Gilbert (1544–1603) English physician and natural philosopher.

:formula_3

The magnetomotive force can often be quickly calculated using Ampère&#x27;s law. For example, the magnetomotive force formula_1 of a long coil is:

:formula_5

where &quot;N&quot; is the number of turns and &quot;I&quot; is the current in the coil. In practice this equation is used for the MMF of real inductors with &quot;N&quot; being the winding number of the inducting coil.

==Magnetic flux==
An applied MMF &#x27;drives&#x27; magnetic flux through the magnetic components of the system. The magnetic flux through a magnetic component is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass through the cross sectional area of that component. This is the &quot;net&quot; number, i.e. the number passing through in one direction, minus the number passing through in the other direction. The direction of the magnetic field vector B is by definition from the south to the north pole of a magnet inside the magnet; outside the field lines go from north to south.

The flux through an element of area perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field is given by the product of the magnetic field and the area element. More generally, magnetic flux Φ is defined by a scalar product of the magnetic field and the area element vector. Quantitatively, the magnetic flux through a surface &quot;S&quot; is defined as the integral of the magnetic field over the area of the surface

:formula_6

For a magnetic component the area S used to calculate the magnetic flux Φ is usually chosen to be the cross-sectional area of the component.

The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the unit of magnetic flux density (or &quot;magnetic induction&quot;, ) is the weber per square meter, or tesla.

==Circuit models==
The most common way of representing a magnetic circuit is the resistance–reluctance model, which draws an analogy between electrical and magnetic circuits. This model is good for systems that contain only magnetic components, but for modelling a system that contains both electrical and magnetic parts it has serious drawbacks. It does not properly model power and energy flow between the electrical and magnetic domains. This is because electrical resistance will dissipate energy whereas magnetic reluctance stores it and returns it later. An alternative model that correctly models energy flow is the gyrator–capacitor model.

==Resistance–reluctance model==

The resistance–reluctance model for magnetic circuits is a lumped-element model that makes electrical resistance analogous to magnetic reluctance.

===Hopkinson&#x27;s law===
In electrical circuits, Ohm&#x27;s law is an empirical relation between the EMF formula_7 applied across an element and the current formula_8 it generates through that element. It is written as:
formula_9
where &quot;R&quot; is the electrical resistance of that material. There is a counterpart to Ohm&#x27;s law used in magnetic circuits. This law is often called Hopkinson&#x27;s law, after John Hopkinson, but was actually formulated earlier by Henry Augustus Rowland in 1873. It states that
formula_10
where formula_1 is the magnetomotive force (MMF) across a magnetic element, formula_12 is the magnetic flux through the magnetic element, and formula_13 is the magnetic reluctance of that element. (It will be shown later that this relationship is due to the empirical relationship between the H-field and the magnetic field B, , where &quot;μ&quot; is the permeability of the material). Like Ohm&#x27;s law, Hopkinson&#x27;s law can be interpreted either as an empirical equation that works for some materials, or it may serve as a definition of reluctance.

Hopkinson&#x27;s law is not a correct analogy with Ohm&#x27;s law in terms of modelling power and energy flow. In particular, there is no power dissipation associated with a magnetic reluctance in the same way as there is a dissipation in an electrical resistance. The magnetic resistance that is a true analogy of electrical resistance in this respect is defined as the ratio of magnetomotive force and the rate of change of magnetic flux. Here rate of change of magnetic flux is standing in for electric current and the Ohm&#x27;s law analogy becomes,
formula_14
where formula_15 is the magnetic resistance. This relationship is part of an electrical-magnetic analogy called the gyrator-capacitor model and is intended to overcome the drawbacks of the reluctance model. The gyrator-capacitor model is, in turn, part of a wider group of compatible analogies used to model systems across multiple energy domains.

===Reluctance===

Magnetic reluctance, or magnetic resistance, is analogous to resistance in an electrical circuit (although it does not dissipate magnetic energy). In likeness to the way an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance, a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance. It is a scalar, extensive quantity, akin to electrical resistance.

The total reluctance is equal to the ratio of the MMF in a passive magnetic circuit and the magnetic flux in this circuit. In an AC field, the reluctance is the ratio of the amplitude values for a sinusoidal MMF and magnetic flux. (see phasors)

The definition can be expressed as:
formula_16
where formula_13 is the reluctance in ampere-turns per weber (a unit that is equivalent to turns per henry).

Magnetic flux always forms a closed loop, as described by Maxwell&#x27;s equations, but the path of the loop depends on the reluctance of the surrounding materials. It is concentrated around the path of least reluctance. Air and vacuum have high reluctance, while easily magnetized materials such as soft iron have low reluctance. The concentration of flux in low-reluctance materials forms strong temporary poles and causes mechanical forces that tend to move the materials towards regions of higher flux so it is always an attractive force(pull).

The inverse of reluctance is called &quot;permeance&quot;.
formula_18

Its SI derived unit is the henry (the same as the unit of inductance, although the two concepts are distinct).

===Permeability and conductivity===

The reluctance of a magnetically uniform magnetic circuit element can be calculated as:
formula_19
where
* is the length of the element,
*formula_20 is the permeability of the material (formula_21 is the relative permeability of the material (dimensionless), and formula_22 is the permeability of free space), and
* is the cross-sectional area of the circuit.

This is similar to the equation for electrical resistance in materials, with permeability being analogous to conductivity; the reciprocal of the permeability is known as magnetic reluctivity and is analogous to resistivity. Longer, thinner geometries with low permeabilities lead to higher reluctance. Low reluctance, like low resistance in electric circuits, is generally preferred.

===Summary of analogy===
The following table summarizes the mathematical analogy between electrical circuit theory and magnetic circuit theory. This is mathematical analogy and not a physical one. Objects in the same row have the same mathematical role; the physics of the two theories are very different. For example, current is the flow of electrical charge, while magnetic flux is not the flow of any quantity.

===Limitations of the analogy===
The resistance–reluctance model has limitations. Electric and magnetic circuits are only superficially similar because of the similarity between Hopkinson&#x27;s law and Ohm&#x27;s law. Magnetic circuits have significant differences that need to be taken into account in their construction: 
* Electric currents represent the flow of particles (electrons) and carry power, part or all of which is dissipated as heat in resistances. Magnetic fields don&#x27;t represent a &quot;flow&quot; of anything, and no power is dissipated in reluctances. 
* The current in typical electric circuits is confined to the circuit, with very little &quot;leakage&quot;. In typical magnetic circuits not all of the magnetic field is confined to the magnetic circuit because magnetic permeability also exists outside materials (see vacuum permeability). Thus, there may be significant &quot;leakage flux&quot; in the space outside the magnetic cores, which must be taken into account but is often difficult to calculate.
* Most importantly, magnetic circuits are nonlinear; the reluctance in a magnetic circuit is not constant, as resistance is, but varies depending on the magnetic field. At high magnetic fluxes the ferromagnetic materials used for the cores of magnetic circuits saturate, limiting further increase of the magnetic flux through, so above this level the reluctance increases rapidly. In addition, ferromagnetic materials suffer from hysteresis so the flux in them depends not just on the instantaneous MMF but also on the history of MMF. After the source of the magnetic flux is turned off, remanent magnetism is left in ferromagnetic materials, creating flux with no MMF.

===Circuit laws===

Magnetic circuits obey other laws that are similar to electrical circuit laws. For example, the total reluctance formula_23 of reluctances formula_24 in series is:
formula_25

This also follows from Ampère&#x27;s law and is analogous to Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law for adding resistances in series. Also, the sum of magnetic fluxes formula_26 into any node is always zero:
formula_27

This follows from Gauss&#x27;s law and is analogous to Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law for analyzing electrical circuits.

Together, the three laws above form a complete system for analysing magnetic circuits, in a manner similar to electric circuits. Comparing the two types of circuits shows that:
* The equivalent to resistance &quot;R&quot; is the &quot;reluctance&quot; formula_28
* The equivalent to current &quot;I&quot; is the &quot;magnetic flux&quot; Φ
* The equivalent to voltage &quot;V&quot; is the &quot;magnetomotive Force&quot; &quot;F&quot;

Magnetic circuits can be solved for the flux in each branch by application of the magnetic equivalent of Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law (KVL) for pure source/resistance circuits. Specifically, whereas KVL states that the voltage excitation applied to a loop is equal to the sum of the voltage drops (resistance times current) around the loop, the magnetic analogue states that the magnetomotive force (achieved from ampere-turn excitation) is equal to the sum of MMF drops (product of flux and reluctance) across the rest of the loop. (If there are multiple loops, the current in each branch can be solved through a matrix equation—much as a matrix solution for mesh circuit branch currents is obtained in loop analysis—after which the individual branch currents are obtained by adding and/or subtracting the constituent loop currents as indicated by the adopted sign convention and loop orientations.) Per Ampère&#x27;s law, the excitation is the product of the current and the number of complete loops made and is measured in ampere-turns. Stated more generally:
formula_29

By Stokes&#x27;s theorem, the closed line integral of around a contour is equal to the open surface integral of curl across the surface bounded by the closed contour. Since, from Maxwell&#x27;s equations, , the closed line integral of evaluates to the total current passing through the surface. This is equal to the excitation, , which also measures current passing through the surface, thereby verifying that the net current flow through a surface is zero ampere-turns in a closed system that conserves energy.

More complex magnetic systems, where the flux is not confined to a simple loop, must be analysed from first principles by using Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

==Applications==
* Air gaps can be created in the cores of certain transformers to reduce the effects of saturation. This increases the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, and enables it to store more energy before core saturation. This effect is used in the flyback transformers of cathode-ray tube video displays and in some types of switch-mode power supply.
* Variation of reluctance is the principle behind the reluctance motor (or the variable reluctance generator) and the Alexanderson alternator.
* Multimedia loudspeakers are typically shielded magnetically, in order to reduce magnetic interference caused to televisions and other CRTs. The speaker magnet is covered with a material such as soft iron to minimize the stray magnetic field.

Reluctance can also be applied to variable reluctance (magnetic) pickups.

<text>Starting in the early 1990s, James F. Moore originated the strategic planning concept of a business ecosystem, now widely adopted in the high tech industry. The basic definition comes from Jim Moore&#x27;s book, &quot;The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems&quot;.

==The origins of the concept==
The concept first appeared in Moore&#x27;s May/June 1993 &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article, titled &quot;Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition&quot;, and won the McKinsey Award for article of the year.

Moore defined &quot;business ecosystem&quot; as:
An economic community supported by a foundation of interacting organizations and individuals—the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they coevolve their capabilities and roles, and tend to align themselves with the directions set by one or more central companies. Those companies holding leadership roles may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles.
Moore used several ecological metaphors, suggesting that the firm is embedded in a (business) environment, that it needs to coevolve with other companies, and that “the particular niche a business occupies is challenged by newly arriving species.” This meant that companies need to become proactive in developing mutually beneficial (&quot;symbiotic&quot;) relationships with customers, suppliers, and even competitors.

Using ecological metaphors to describe business structure and operations is increasingly common especially within the field of information technology (IT). For example, J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, has written that &quot;business ecosystems&quot; describe “the pattern of launching new technologies that has emerged from Silicon Valley”. He defines business ecology as “a more productive set of processes for developing and commercializing new technologies” that is characterized by the “rapid prototyping, short product-development cycles, early test marketing, options-based compensation, venture funding, early corporate independence”. DeLong also has expressed that the new way is likely to endure “because it&#x27;s a better business ecology than the legendarily lugubrious model refined at Xerox Parc—a more productive set of processes for rapidly developing and commercializing new technologies”.

Mangrove Software, The Montague Institute, and Stephen Abram, Vice President of Micromedia, Ltd., Tom Gruber, co-founder and CTO of Intraspect Software, Vinod K. Dar, Managing Director of Dar &amp; Company, have all advocated this approach.

==Industries==
Gruber explains that over a century ago, Ford Motors did well using methods of mass production, an assembly line, and insourcing. However, Ford began to outsource its production “[w]hen the ecology evolved.” Gruber (n.d.) has stated that such evolution in the ecology of the business world is “punctuated now and then by radical changes in the environment” and that “globalization and the Internet are the equivalents of large-scale climate change. Globalization is eliminating the traditional advantages of the large corporation: access to capital, access to markets, and economies of scale”.

The application service provider (ASP) industry is moving toward relationship networks and focusing on core competencies. “According to the gospel of Cisco Systems, companies inclined to exist together within an “ecosystem” facilitate the imminence of Internet-based application delivery”.

Books also use natural systems metaphors without discussing the interfaces between human business and biological ecosystems.

Another work defines business ecology as “a new field for sustainable organizational management and design,” one “that is based on the principle that organizations, as living organisms, are most successful when their development and behavior are aligned with their core purpose and values – what we call “social DNA’”.

The need for companies to attend to ecological health is indicated by the following: “Business ecology is based on the elegant structure and principles of natural systems. It recognizes that to develop healthy business ecosystems, leaders and their organizations must see themselves, and their environments, through an “ecological lens”.

==Biological ecosystems==
The concept ecosystem in economy and business stems from the ecosystem concept in ecology. Some environmentalists, however, have used &quot;business ecosystems&quot; as a way to talk about environmental issues as they relate to business rather than as a metaphor to describe the increasing complexity of relationships among companies. According to Townsend, business ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between business and organisms and their environments. The goal of this &quot;business ecology&quot; is sustainability through the complete ecological synchronization and integration of a business with the sites that it inhabits, uses, and affects.

Other environmentalists believe that the ecosystem metaphor is just a way for business to appear &#x27;Green&#x27; and natural. According to author Alan Marshall, for example, the metaphor is used to make out that somehow business operates using natural principles which should be left to run without interference by governments.

In the PESTEL-framework, ecology or environment is one of the criteria to analyse the external circumstances of a company.

<doc id="1115103" wikidata="Q5491480" url="?curid=1115103" title="Franklin Electronic Publishers">
<text>Franklin Electronic Publishers, Incorporated (formerly Franklin Computer Corporation) was an American consumer electronics manufacturer based in Burlington, New Jersey, founded in 1981. Since the mid-1980s, it has primarily created and sold hand-held electronic references, such as spelling correctors, dictionaries, translation devices, medical references, and Bibles. It was publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol FEP until September 30, 2009, when it merged with Saunders Acquisition Corporation.

==Early history==
Franklin was founded in 1981 by Barry Borden, Russell Bower, and Joel Shusterman as Franklin Computer Corporation. It manufactured clones of the Apple II, which it first marketed in 1982.
In early 1982, Franklin released the Franklin ACE 100, and in March of the same year, the Franklin ACE 1000; they were very close copies of the Apple II and Apple II Plus computers, respectively. The motherboard design is nearly identical and Franklin also copied Apple&#x27;s ROMs. Two months later, Apple Computer sued Franklin for copyright violation. Franklin initially won, but ultimately lost. (See &quot;Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.&quot;)

Franklin followed with the ACE 1200, which included two built-in 5¼&quot; floppy drives and an ACE 80 Zilog Z80 processor card (a rebranded PCPI Appli-Card) for CP/M compatibility—a popular third-party option for the Apple II. The ACE 1200 was identical to the ACE 1000, but with the addition of dual built-in floppy drives and four expansion cards pre-installed (one of which offered color video; the ACE 1000 was monochrome). At its peak workforce in 1983, Franklin employed 450 employees.

In August 1983, Franklin faced a legal ruling against its argument that computer code, being primarily in digital form, could not be copyrighted since it did not exist in printed form. Franklin openly acknowledged that it had copied Apple&#x27;s ROM and operating system code. Despite this admission, Franklin obtained an injunction that allowed it to continue selling its computers. This significant case had long-lasting effects and established important legal precedents regarding copyright and reverse engineering. Even more than 30 years after the ruling in August 1983, the case continued to be frequently cited in legal discussions.

In June 1984, Franklin filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. Franklin reduced its workforce to just over 100, from a previous total of 275 employees. Franklin had been planning to release the Franklin CX, a portable Apple II clone, but this release was cancelled due to the bankruptcy.

Starting in October 1985, Franklin released a second-generation line of Apple II clones, consisting of the ACE 2000 series (based on the Apple IIe) and ACE 500 (based on the Apple IIc). These included more memory, as well as offering many features unique to the Apple IIe and Apple IIc, all while undercutting Apple&#x27;s price. The ACE 2200 sported a detached keyboard and dual internal 5.25-inch floppy disk drives.

Franklin also released a pair of IBM PC compatible computers, the Franklin PC6000 and PC8000, during 1986–1988. Both were based on the Intel 8088 running at 4.77 MHz. The PC6000 had 512K of RAM and a single floppy drive, while the PC8000 had 640K and dual drives. These matched the most common configurations of the time.

Soon after the ACE 2200&#x27;s release, Apple was able to force Franklin out of the desktop computer market entirely, including its IBM-compatible PCs. As a result, the only Apple-compatible computer that remained on the market was VTech&#x27;s Laser 128.

With the loss of its desktop computer business, Franklin concentrated on its handheld line, which it had introduced in 1986.

In 1987, Franklin released the Spelling Ace, which could provide spelling corrections to 80,000 English words based on technology from Proximity Technology. Franklin also released its Language Master device, which included spelling correction, dictionary definitions and a thesaurus. In 1988, Franklin acquired Proximity Technology. In 1989, Franklin released an electronic version of the Bible in the King James, Revised Standard and New International versions. Johnny Cash was a spokesperson for the company,
 recording Bible passages for their line of electronic Bibles.

In 1995, Franklin launched its Bookman product line, which came with an installed database and included a slot for plugging in a second electronic book. Prices varied depending on the title. Previously, the Digital Book System (DBS) product was a player only, with two slots for electronic book cards. Franklin collaborated with Bien Logic to create educational titles for the Bookman platform.

==Products==
Currently FEP makes electronic versions of dictionaries, translators, tutors, puzzles, Bibles, Rolodex organizers, calculators, and books.

===PDA===
In the past, it also made the Rex line of personal digital assistants, such as the REX 5000. That product line was later sold to Xircom.

===Language products===
The company marketed its first handheld reference device, the Spelling Ace spelling corrector, in 1986.

The company also designs and licenses linguistic software to third-party software application providers through its Proximity Technology Division.

The company&#x27;s first product for the Asian market, the Japanese-English Electronic PageMark Dictionary, was distributed through its partner Seiko Instruments, Inc.

===eBook===
The eBook products are sold in BOOKMAN Book Card, digital download (Franklin Reader, Mobipocket Reader, or other file formats) formats. They also made an eBook reader called eBookMan.

==Outsourced R&amp;D==
Franklin Electronic Publishers outsourced all of its R&amp;D to Hong Kong, with the last day of U.S. R&amp;D operations being March 31, 2009.

<text>Earl Tywone Stevens (born November 15, 1967), better known by his stage name E-40, is an American rapper. Stevens is a founding member of the rap group The Click and the founder of Sick Wid It Records. He has released 27 studio albums to date, appeared on numerous movie soundtracks, and has also done guest appearances on a host of other rap albums. Initially an underground artist, his 1995 solo album &quot;In a Major Way&quot; opened him up to a wider audience. Beginning in 1998, he began collaborating with mainstream rappers outside the San Francisco Bay Area. He rose to higher mainstream popularity in 2006 with his single &quot;Tell Me When to Go&quot;, which was produced by Lil Jon.

==Early life==
Stevens was born in Vallejo, California. He grew up with his siblings raised by a divorced mother who worked three jobs, and he became interested in hip hop after hearing &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; by the Sugarhill Gang. Beginning in fourth grade, Stevens played the snare and bass drum. He graduated from Hogan High School in Vallejo in 1985. Stevens played baseball in high school, recorded music with his siblings, and sold their recordings from the back of a car. After high school, Stevens enrolled at Grambling State University in 1986 with his cousin Brandt Jones and attended the school for one year.

==Music career==
===1986–1999===
Stevens made his rap debut as E-40 in 1986 with his cousin B-Legit, sister Suga-T, and brother D-Shot in the group Most Valuable Players. After impressing fellow students with a rap remix of the school song and a Grambling State talent show, Most Valuable Players released a single, &quot;The King&#x27;s Men&quot;. The group later became The Click and released the EP &quot;Let&#x27;s Side&quot; in 1990. The EP was co-produced by Mike Mosley and Al Eaton and was released on Sick Wid It Records, an independent label founded by E-40. In 1992 they released a second album, &quot;Down and Dirty&quot;, and in 1993 E-40 made his solo album debut. &quot;Federal&quot;, a nine-track LP/14-track CD produced by Studio Ton and released by Sick Wid It Records in association with SMG (Solar Music Group), a regional distributor.

In 1993, the Click had mainstream hit, &quot;Captain Save a Hoe&quot; (radio edit &quot;Captain Save Them Thoe&quot;). They moved back to Vallejo and teamed up with D-Shot, E-40&#x27;s brother, to form the group MVP or Most Valuable Players. E-40&#x27;s gospel singing uncle (Saint Charles) helped them put out the record. Suga-T was then added to the group to form the Click.

Although having a large following on the West Coast, E-40 did not have a large mainstream audience, so only two of his songs released under Jive Records, &quot;1-Luv&quot; featuring Levitti and &quot;Things&#x27;ll Never Change&quot; featuring Bo-Roc, charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He had been working nearly exclusively with rappers from the Bay Area until 1997, when he released the double disc compilation &quot;Southwest Riders&quot; featuring exclusively rap acts from the Bay Area and the south. His collaboration with southern rappers continued in 1998, when he was given guest appearances on albums by Southern rappers, including &quot;Lost&quot; by Eightball, and &quot;MP da Last Don&quot; by Master P.

===2000–2010===

In 2003 E-40 began hosting &quot;E-Feezy Radio&quot;, a weekly program on San Francisco hip-hop radio station KMEL that showcased Bay Area hip hop. KMEL regularly broadcast the program until 2008. After completing a deal with Jive Records he signed with Lil Jon&#x27;s BME Recordings and Reprise Records. After the signing, he appeared on Lil Jon&#x27;s single &quot;Snap Yo Fingers&quot;, also featuring Sean P of YoungBloodZ, which became a hit reaching the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Afterwards, his single &quot;Tell Me When to Go&quot;, featuring Oakland rapper Keak da Sneak, became popular throughout the United States, and E-40 appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Direct Effect&quot; and BET&#x27;s &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;. Publicity for E-40 was achieved through the MTV special &quot;My Block: The Bay&quot;. He later released &quot;U and Dat&quot; in April 2006, featuring T-Pain and Kandi Girl and produced by Lil Jon.

<text>Paul Frank (full name Paul Frank Sunich, born August 29, 1967, in Huntington Beach, California) is an American cartoonist, artist and fashion designer. He is the creator of all the characters from Paul Frank Industries, including Julius the monkey.

==Early life and education==
During the 1990s, Sunich was an art student at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California.

==Career==
He bought a sewing machine in order to complete small projects. One day, he used some spare orange vinyl to create a wallet and after seeing his work, his friends expressed interest in other accessories, so he began to sew items such as guitar straps and backpacks. A few years later, Sunich formed Paul Frank Industries (his first and middle name) along with his partners Ryan Heuser and John Oswald, in order to keep up with the demand for his products. He worked at another job during the day, but sewed and sold his products during his spare time. The company expanded, with collaborations with many bands, artists, and companies.

Sunich left Paul Frank Industries in November 2005, in a dispute with his business partners. His first clothing design project after leaving the company was a brand licensing arrangement with the Boone&#x27;s Farm beverage company. Sunich owned and headed his own design studio Park La Fun.

In February 2016 he returned to Paul Frank Industries, now owned by Saban Brands.

<text>Komarov is a lunar impact crater that lies across the southeastern edge of Mare Moscoviense, on the northern hemisphere of the far side of the Moon. It is a complex feature with an irregular appearance.

The northern rim of Komarov bulges outwards into the mare, giving the crater a pear shape. The regions around the northeastern and southern rims are rugged and uneven, and the crater floor in between has been resurfaced by lava flows that have completely submerged the western third of the interior. This surface is marked by a pattern of multiple rilles that run primarily in a north–south direction, but are cracked like a drying mud bed. Along the interior of the eastern rim is a cleft-like formation that curves along the inner rim. The northwestern rim has an outer where it slopes down to the plain of the neighboring mare.

The crater is named after Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov (1927–1967).

<text>The Earth Shoe (also known as the Kalsø Earth Shoe) was an unconventional style of shoe invented circa 1957 by Danish yoga instructor and shoe designer Anna Kalsø. Its unique &quot;negative heel technology&quot; design featured a sole that was thinner at the heel than at the forefoot, so that when wearing them, one walked heel downward, as when walking in sand, with various claimed health benefits. 

In 1970, Raymond and Eleanor Jacobs founded the Earth Shoe company in the United States, after discovering Anna Kalsø and her negative-heel shoes in Copenhagen, Denmark. The shoes were introduced in New York City on April 1, 1970, three weeks before the first Earth Day. The shoes quickly became a popular countercultural symbol of the 1970s. The company expanded to 123 stores to sell the shoes, boots, and sandals, all with the negative-heel design, across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The shoes surged in popularity and were prominently featured on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Soon, other firms, including Roots Canada, also marketed similar negative-heel shoes. Experts expressed varying opinions on whether the shoes were good or bad for one&#x27;s feet.

By 1976 sales had grown to $14 million, but the company dissolved in 1977. When the manufacturer of Kalsø Earth Shoes attempted to broaden their design by introducing many new styles, coupled by over 100 fake Earth shoe looking imitations being introduced by competitors, the original parent company became overextended and embroiled in a lawsuit with Penosbscot Shoe Company (maker of the hand-swen moccasin Earth Shoe). Subsequently, Kalso Earth Shoe entered Chapter 11 leaving 140 nationwide Earth Shoe store owners without a supplier. In 1977 Tarney Enterprises (Milwaukee, WI) negotiated for and received the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute the shoes in North America. Earth Shoe store owners, John and Richard Tarney began making and distributing the shoes nationwide; and for the first time, Earth Shoes were available to shoe stores other than Earth Shoe stores. Previously, the original, patented Kaslo Earth Shoes were exclusively available only in Earth Shoe Stores. Eventually running into manufacturing difficulties with an east coast subcontactor shoe manufacturer, Tarney Enterprises ceased making the shoes in 1980. In 2001, Kalsø Earth Shoes re-surfaced after the rights to the name, technology and branded properties were purchased by Meynard Designs, Inc. Subsequent reorganization of Meynard Designs led to the creation of Earth, Inc., as the manufacturing and marketing entity for Kalsø Earth Shoes. However, the distinguishing characteristic of the original Kalso Earth Shoes, the negative heel, is no longer available. Earth, Inc.&#x27;s shoes are not to be confused with the Earth Spirit shoe brand sold by Walmart, and others.

<text>van Rhijn is an old lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, in the northern hemisphere. It lies due south of the larger crater Störmer, and to the north-northeast of De Moraes.

The outer rim of this crater has been deeply worn and eroded by impacts, with smaller craters intruding into the northeast, northwest, and southeastern parts of the rim. The remaining features of the rim have been softened and rounded, leaving the crater little more than a depression in the surface. The interior floor is relatively flat and featureless, with no significant craters.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to van Rhijn.
