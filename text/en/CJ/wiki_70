<text>The Erme is a river in south Devon, England. From its source on Dartmoor it flows in a generally southerly direction past some of the best-preserved archaeological remains on the moor. It leaves the moor at the town of Ivybridge and continues southward, passing the settlements of Ermington, Modbury and Holbeton. Near Holbeton it becomes a ria and empties into the English Channel in Bigbury Bay, between the rivers Yealm and Avon.

==Toponymy==
The Ravenna Cosmography, an imperfect list of place-names that was compiled in the early 8th century from late Roman sources, lists amongst many others, over twenty names that probably refer to places in south-west England. Most of these have not been positively identified, but the name &quot;Aramis/Aranus/Armis&quot; was suggested to be the River Erme by Rivet and Smith in &quot;The Place-names of Roman Britain&quot; (1979).

The first certain documentary reference to the river is as &quot;Irym&quot; in the cartulary of Buckfast Abbey, dated 1240. Other early recorded forms are &quot;Hyrm&quot;, &quot;Irm&quot;, &quot;Erm&quot; and, in the mid 16th century, &quot;Arme&quot;. The derivation of the name remains unknown. Ekwall&#x27;s suggestion that it is a back-formation from &quot;Ermington&quot; is now thought to be unlikely. Tristram Risdon, in his 1811 &quot;Survey of Devon&quot; gives an alternate name for the River Erme as the River Arme. He also refers to the mouth of the River Erme as Armouth. In Donn&#x27;s map of Devon published in 1765, the village of Mothecombe at the mouth of the river, is referred to as Muddicomb.

==On Dartmoor==
The River Erme rises near the centre of southern Dartmoor on the Abbot&#x27;s Way less than a mile to the south of the source of the River Plym. Between these two sources lies Duck&#x27;s Pool, where there is a plaque and letterbox in memory of the Dartmoor author William Crossing. There are extensive early tin mining workings nearby known as Erme Pits, which are in places over 15 metres deep.

For the first mile or so the river flows south-eastwards. It is joined on the north bank by Wollake, which is the lower part of the Blacklane Brook that rises on the southern flanks of Fox Tor a mile and a half to the north, between Crane Hill and Naker&#x27;s Hill. The short streams, Dry Lake and Red Lake also join on this side, the latter rising near the disused clay works at Redlake. The confluence of Red Lake, and the source of the Erme are two of the thirty-three places that delineate the ancient boundary of the Forest of Dartmoor. On this stretch, a short stream flowing down Hortonsford Bottom from Langcombe Hill also joins the river from the south.

Between Stingers Hill and Redlake the river turns southward into an area known as The Meadow, where it is crossed by the Upper Erme stone row, the longest on Dartmoor at . For the next mile or more downstream from here there are extensive archaeological remains on the river&#x27;s banks, most notably Erme Pound (the highest and largest Bronze Age enclosure in the area), Downing&#x27;s House (a well-preserved &quot;tinner&#x27;s cache&quot; or &quot;beehive hut&quot; with much of its roof preserved), and a number of tinner&#x27;s huts and blowing houses.
As the river reaches the edge of the high moor, it flows through the gorge it has cut between Stalldown Barrow on the west and Piles Hill to the east. Here, on the eastern bank, lies Piles Copse which is one of the few areas of ancient woodland on Dartmoor and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Although the moorland valley of the Erme today appears to be natural and unspoiled, the entire valley floor from its source down to Piles Copse is artificial, being created by the extensive tin-streaming operations that took place between the 4th and 14th centuries. Supporting evidence for this was provided by a study published in 2004 which showed that phases of aggradation occurred lower down the valley between the 4th century and the 7th century, and in the 13th century.

Leaving the open moor, the river passes into enclosed land and under its first road bridge at the hamlet of Harford. At this point it is joined by the minor stream of Butter Brook, with its now disused reservoir. From Harford down to the boundary of the national park, which here follows the main railway line between Plymouth and Exeter, much of the river&#x27;s course is in woodland and is a popular site for kayaking and canoeing, especially in Long Timber Woods.

==Ivybridge to Holbeton==
After leaving the national park, the river continues southward, passing through the centre of the town of Ivybridge where it formed the source of the town&#x27;s prosperity by powering a grist mill, a paper mill and a fulling and tucking mill. In 1813 the only bridge over the river in the village (as it was then) was the inspiration for J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s painting &quot;The Ivy Bridge&quot;.

Immediately south of Ivybridge, the river passes beneath the A38 Devon Expressway – the main road link between Exeter and Plymouth – and then continues to flow southerly through countryside. On its western bank is the village of Ermington with its famous crooked church spire and the Grade I listed Flete House, the river has been measured near the village since 1973, yielding an average flow of . The A379 road between Modbury and Yealmpton crosses the river at Sequer&#x27;s Bridge, shortly below which the river flows over a weir and becomes tidal.

Surrounding this stretch of the river there are several apple orchards, remnants of the many that were once here. Unlike most of the South Hams where the field boundaries consist of Devon hedge banks, hereabouts the boundaries are walls constructed from rounded river boulders, more like the dry stone walls found on Dartmoor.


==The estuary==
As it passes to the east of the village of Holbeton the Erme becomes a ria with extensive areas of salt marsh and mud that are uncovered at low tide. The geology of the area is mostly slate from the Devonian period. The river enters the English Channel near the villages of Kingston to the east and Mothecombe and Holbeton to the west and at the mouth of the estuary lie the beaches of Wonwell and Mothecombe. The estuary is surrounded by the 5,000 acre Flete Estate.

===History===
In 1991 and 1992 some 42 tin ingots were found in the mouth of the estuary
 on the north side of the West Mary Reef. These date from between 500 BC and 600 AD. Tin mining was in existence on Dartmoor from an early date. Dartmoor tin-mining would have been a major part of the South Devon economy throughout its history.

There is an Iron Age hill fort at Holbury near Holbeton overlooking the estuary from the west and evidence of a very early 11th Century fort and settlement just a little way inland at Oldaport. In the 1950s and again in the 1990s a variety of fragments of &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and Roman pots were discovered on Mothecombe beach.

There are four ruined lime kilns in the estuary; all are in an advanced state of disrepair. Limestone came by sea from Plymouth quarries. Coal arrived on the beach from South Wales and was unloaded to horse-drawn carts. Some was stored in a shed at the top of the Mothecombe slip, but some was loaded into a small barge to move further up the estuary as far as Efford.

From Clyng Corn Mill (now a private house to Orcheton Quay) there used to be a canal which has long since silted up and is now just a small stream. This canal brought goods to and from Modbury and beyond. &quot;Runaway Lane&quot; was the main link between Orcheton Quay and Modbury. The 1809 Ordnance Survey map shows the canal very clearly.

There was a fishing community on Wonwell beach for many years but the houses are now in ruins and overgrown. Professional fishermen worked the beach until the 1960s. The main catch was lobster and crab. These were boiled on the beach and carried to the village of Kingston on donkeys. The withies which were used to make the pots and panniers were grown in willow plats (areas of pollarded willow) in the area.

Many ships have been lost in the area over the centuries. The Salcombe Cannon Wreck of the 1630s is a notable site. A large cast iron Swedish gun dating to 1690–1720 has been found in the estuary. On 15 December 1793, went aground on the jagged East Mary rocks, which together with the West Mary Rocks form a mostly submerged bar to the estuary. At the court martial, the vessel&#x27;s pilot stated that he believed that he was entering Plymouth Sound, some 14 miles west.

====Smuggling====
Smuggling activity took place in the estuary. Initially the coast was patrolled by the Riding Officers of the Preventive, supplanted by the coastguards: on the Mothecombe side are the original Coastguard Cottages - just above Coastguard Beach. &quot;Customs Ports&quot; were first set out in 1558 as administrative areas. In 1786 when every part of the coastline came under the jurisdiction of the local &quot;Customs Port&quot;, the Plymouth jurisdiction extended as far east as Challaborough and therefore covered the estuary. Records show that the Coastguard Station existed at Mothecombe in 1822 with 5 Boatmen and an Officer. In 1870 the Chief Officer of Coastal Guard at Mothecombe was Robert S Matson. By 1881 the River Erme was included in the Dartmouth &quot;Customs Port&quot;. Coastguards were also based in the village of Kingston. The next station going east was at Charlaborough (Ringmore) - now called Challaborough.

====World War II====
&quot;Persier&quot; was hit by a torpedo near to the Eddystone Lighthouse in 1945 and her wreck is just outside the estuary.

In 1940 a detachment of Indian troops were stationed at Woodleigh and there is a remembrance of these troops and their mules delivering barbed wire to Mothecombe for the coastal defences.

There was a memory of a dog setting off mines on the estuary recorded in a publication produced by the Kingston History Society. A platoon of the 5th Buffs Regiment was stationed on Wonwell Beach; some in a Nissen Hut and some in one of the old cottages. One soldier was stationed at the phone box in Kingston to take messages to the beach. There was a mine field at the high-water mark which was fenced on the landward side. Mothecombe Beach had a similar minefield. One of the mines on Wonwell was set off by a missing dog after the platoon at Wonwell had been withdrawn (as the beach was covered from Mothecombe). Others became unstable and also exploded.

The 1919 and 1947 Ordnance Survey maps show a &quot;rifle range&quot; stretching up the estuary from Owen&#x27;s Point to Pamflete—this may have been related to war time activity.

====Film locations====
Filming took part for some of the &quot;Hornblower&quot; TV series on the Wonwell slip, Wonwell Beach and Mothecombe Beach. &quot;International Velvet&quot; (1978) has an opening scene across the sands. In 1985 Scobbiscombe Farm, which is above and just to the east of the estuary, was used as a location for the film Revolution which concerned the American War of Independence. The cast included Al Pacino, Donald Sutherland and a whole host of cut out British Red Coats, one of whom found a new home in a local greenhouse for a while. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995) was shot at various locations on the estuary including Efford House (country home of the &quot;Dashwoods&quot;), Mothecombe House and Mothecombe Beach. &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1996) was filmed at Mothecombe.

===Today===
The estuary is now designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and an Erme Estuary Management Plan has been produced. The South West Coast Path crosses between the slipways on the Wonwell (eastern) and Mothecombe (western) sides of the estuary, but crossing is only possible at low tide - and even then walkers are very likely to get their knees wet. The alternative route by road is some 9 miles around the estuary. The 1947 Ordnance Survey map show this as a vehicular ford between the slipways. There is another ford marked on the 1947 map between Saltercrease and Efford, but this is now said to be too deep to cross.

====Flora and fauna====
Little egrets are now year-round residents. Curlews, oystercatchers and common shelducks are all regular visitors and kingfishers are often seen above Holbeton. Weaverfish bury themselves in the gravel in the low water.

====Beaches====
Mothecombe Beach (also called Meadowsfoot Beach) as of 2017, is open seven days a week. The building on the south side of the beach was a private tea room built in 1873-1875 by Mr H Mildmay for use during private picnics. It is built on the foundations of an early lime kiln. Other private tea houses were built elsewhere on the Flete estate. A little further to the south there is a small circular stone wall which fills with water as the tide comes in. This used to be a swimming pool, but no longer functions as such. A little further on is a WW2 pillbox.

Coastguards Beach and Wonwell Beach are open every day. Coastguards Beach also has a pillbox although it is now almost covered by undergrowth, and the remains of yet another lie a little south of Coastguards beach, but this has been damaged by the sea.

<text>Development studies is an interdisciplinary branch of social science. Development studies is offered as a specialized master&#x27;s degree in a number of reputed universities around the world. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in developing countries and countries with a colonial history, such as the UK, where the discipline originated. Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the United Nations, World Bank, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), media and journalism houses, private sector development consultancy firms, corporate social responsibility (CSR) bodies and research centers.

==Professional bodies==

Throughout the world, a number of professional bodies for development studies have been founded:
* Europe: European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI)
* Latin America: Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO)
* Asia: Asian Political and International Studies Association (APISA)
* Africa: Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) and Organization for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA)
* Arabic world: Arab Institutes and Centers for Economic and Social Development Research (AICARDES)

The common umbrella organisation of these association is the Inter-regional Coordinating Committee of Development Associations (ICCDA). In the UK and Ireland, the Development Studies Association is a major source of information for research on and studying in development studies. Its mission is to connect and promote those working on development research.

The emergence of development studies as an academic discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is in large part due to increasing concern about economic prospects for the third world after decolonisation. In the immediate post-war period, development economics, a branch of economics, arose out of previous studies in colonial economics. By the 1960s, an increasing number of development economists felt that economics alone could not fully address issues such as political effectiveness and educational provision. Development studies arose as a result of this, initially aiming to integrate ideas of politics and economics. Since then, it has become an increasingly inter- and multi-disciplinary subject, encompassing a variety of social scientific fields. In recent years the use of political economy analysis- the application of the analytical techniques of economics- to try and assess and explain political and social factors that either enhance or limit development has become increasingly widespread as a way of explaining the success or failure of reform processes. The era of modern development is commonly deemed to have commenced with the inauguration speech of Harry S. Truman in 1949. In Point Four of his speech, with reference to Latin America and other poor nations, he said:

More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people.

But development studies has since also taken an interest in lessons of past development experiences of Western countries. More recently, the emergence of human security – a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats – has led to a growing recognition of a relationship between security and development. Human security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies.

Global Research cooperation between researchers from countries in the Global North and the Global South, so called North-south research partnerships, allow development studies to consider more diverse perspectives on development studies and other strongly value driven issues. Thus, it can contribute new findings to the field of research.

<text>A rivethead or rivet head is a person associated with the industrial dance music scene. In stark contrast to the original industrial culture, whose performers and heterogeneous audience were sometimes referred to as &quot;industrialists&quot;, the rivethead scene is a coherent youth culture closely linked to a discernible fashion style. The scene emerged in the late 1980s on the basis of electro-industrial, EBM, and industrial rock music. The associated dress style draws on military fashion and punk aesthetics with hints of fetish wear, mainly inspired by the scene&#x27;s musical protagonists.

== Origins of the term ==
Initially, the term &quot;rivethead&quot; had been used since the 1940s as a nickname for North American automotive assembly line and steel construction workers and hit the mainstream through the publication of Ben Hamper&#x27;s &quot;Rivethead: Tales From the Assembly Line&quot;, which is otherwise unrelated to the subculture.

Glenn Chase, founder of San Diego label Re-Constriction Records, is responsible for the term&#x27;s meaning in the 1990s. In 1993, he released &quot;Rivet Head Culture&quot;, a compilation that contains several electro-industrial and industrial rock acts from the American underground music scene. In the same year, industrial rock group Chemlab − whose members were close friends of Chase − had released their debut album &quot;Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar&quot;, which includes a track called &quot;Rivet Head&quot;. Chemlab singer Jared Louche said he did not remember where the term came from, although he stated that this song title was in his mind for years.

== Music ==
The rivethead scene is remotely related but not directly connected to the industrial music culture. Industrial music is a genre of experimental and music, intertwined with graphical visualization (mostly with disturbing graphical content). The absence of conventional song structures, such as rhythm and melody, is a main characteristic of the genre, whereas the music preferred by the rivethead scene includes several danceable and song-oriented styles that are sometimes considered &quot;post-industrial&quot;. Like post-punk, the term &quot;post-industrial&quot; describes a musical genre that developed distinctly from its roots and turned into several strands of sound, namely electro-industrial, electronic body music, and industrial rock, often referred to as industrial dance music. Those styles differ from traditional industrial music regarding aesthetics, sound, and production techniques.

== Aesthetics ==
The rivethead dress style has been inspired by military aesthetics, complemented by fashion &quot;that mimics the grit and grime of industrial sectors in major metropolitan areas&quot;&quot;.&quot; Additionally, it borrows elements of punk fashion, such as a fanned and dyed Mohawk hairstyle, and fetish wear such as black leather and PVC tops, pants and shorts partly supplemented with modern primitive body modifications such as tattoos and piercings.

Occasionally, rivetheads emphasize a post-apocalyptic, dystopian influence, often inspired by movies, e.g. &quot;Mad Max&quot; (1979), &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), &quot;Gunhed&quot; (1989), &quot;Death Machine&quot; (1994), and &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1995). Several movies, such as &quot;Hardware&quot; (1990), &quot;Strange Days&quot; and &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (1995), feature music tracks by Ministry, KMFDM, Diatribe, Stabbing Westward and other bands associated with the rivethead culture. Other influences include sci-fi archetypes such as Lupus Yonderboy and Razorgirl, characters from the Sprawl trilogy by William Gibson.
Below some basic characteristics of the rivethead dress style. As a divergence from the extravagance of youth cultures such as New Romantic, goth, cyber, and steampunk, the idea is to make a statement with as few fashion components as possible. The rivethead look commonly is unadorned and epitomizes a direct reflection of the social environment (&quot;street survival wear&quot;).

=== Male ===
* Tops: Black, gray or olive tank tops, plain t-shirts, band shirts, sleeveless shirts (sometimes with the sleeves ripped off), tie-dye crinkle or burst pattern shirts; black leather jackets (frequently painted with band logos), and MA-1 flight jackets.
* Pants: Cargo and BDU paratrooper pants, ripped jeans, vintage shorts, often but not always black or Woodland camouflage; usually tucked into boots, rolled at the bottom cuffs or worn as cut-off shorts. Black leather pants and bondage pants are sometimes worn.
* Footwear: Combat boots, steel-toe boots or low shoes, such as Dr. Martens, Gripfasts, Grinders and Underground shoes.
* Hair: Partially shaved (undercut), flattop, Mohawk or completely shaved. Sometimes long hair in combination with undercut or dreadlocks.
* Accessories: Teashades and Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses. Battle Dress Uniform-style or military belts; bracelets and dog tags; fingerless leather gloves; sometimes jewelry that incorporates industrial elements such as nails, screws and cogs. Suspenders, or &quot;braces&quot;, normally worn hanging off trousers or shorts.
* Body modification: Primarily piercings and tattoos.

=== Female ===
Rivetgirls may dress along with the &quot;femme fatale&quot; look: sexuality as power. Common are fetish wear, such as black PVC and leather corsages, miniskirts, ankle-deep or knee-high stiletto heel boots; less makeup than Goths and 1980s New Wave fashion girls, who were also an influence on the late-1980s/early 1990s rivetgirl style (cf. fishnet tights, stilettos, Dr. Martens low boots). Often dyed hair (black, sometimes red or blond) that is long, short, spiked, partially shaved (see Maria Azevedo of Battery and Yone Dudas of Decoded Feedback) or dreadlocked (see Anna Christine of Luxt). On the other hand, the female rivethead fashion look may be and often is identical to the tough style of the male rivetheads (Tank Girl aesthetic; military wear such as tank tops, paratrooper pants and combat boots). Kim X, co-founder of California-based music label COP International, compared the female rivethead attitude to the Riot grrrl movement.

== Comparison with goth subculture ==
The rivethead scene of the 1980s and 1990s was different from the goth subculture in ideological and musical terms, as well as in their visual aesthetics. Confusion regarding the boundaries of those two youth cultures has heightened because of the late-1990s &quot;multi-subcultural&quot; cross-hybridization, which led people to incorrectly believe that rivetheads are an offshoot of the goth subculture. Canadian novelist and author Nancy Kilpatrick labelled this youth-cultural overlap &quot;industrial goth&quot;, as does Julia Borden. ( − &quot;Note&quot;: In the heyday of the rivethead culture, the term &quot;industrial goth&quot; as a description of a youth culture did not exist).



Goths are a dark romantic outgrowth of the punk and post-punk movements that emerged in the early 1980s while rivetheads developed from the industrial dance music scene that came to be in the second half of the 1980s, hand in hand with the media success of post-industrial artists such as Skinny Puppy, Front 242, Front Line Assembly, Ministry, KMFDM, and Numb. The rivethead scene is a male-dominated youth subculture that shows a provocative, insurgent as well as socio-critical approach. The Goth subculture is &quot;“equally open to women, men and transgendered people”&quot;, and frequently devoid of any interest in ethical activism or political involvements.

<text>The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s are a Japanese rock band from Tokyo with a retro-inspired sound that draws heavily from the 1960s garage rock scene. They first started performing as a quartet in Tokyo, and recruited guest performers during their Australian tour. They became a trio in 1992, before touring Australia.

==Members==
The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s formed when Sachiko and Yoshiko &quot;Ronnie&quot; Fujiyama, two sisters from Tokyo who both shared a passion for rock and roll, founded the band in 1986 with two other members. Originally, the line-up consisted of Yoshiko on vocals and guitar, Rico on second guitar, Yoshie on bass guitar and Sachiko on drums. After several line-up changes (including the bassist Yoshiko &quot;Yama&quot; Yamaguchi, who was the bassist featured in the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; movie), the band eventually became a trio after Rico&#x27;s and Yoshie&#x27;s departures. Yoshiko and Sachiko are still the main components in the band, and now Akiko Omo has rejoined the band as the bass guitarist (She originally joined the 5.6.7.8&#x27;s in the early 1990s).

Even though the group mostly sing their songs in Japanese, they do many covers of American rock and roll records from the 1950s to the 1980s. However, their official website and most of their fansites and fanclubs are in Japanese, as they have their biggest following in their home country.

Yoshiko, who plays a Teisco guitar and sports a &quot;Teenage Queen Delinquent&quot; tattoo on her upper right arm, was initially the lead vocalist, but as the band performed more rock and roll songs originally performed by female groups, every member had equal parts in vocals and many songs are performed singing simultaneously.

==The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s in the West==

The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s became known in the West after their appearance in &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot;, in which they performed &quot;I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Blue&quot; (a cover of The Ikettes&#x27; song) and &quot;Woo Hoo&quot; in a Tokyo club, &quot;The House Of Blue Leaves&quot;. On the Special Bonus Features of the &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; DVD, one of the specials featured a live performance which shows the 5.6.7.8&#x27;s singing &quot;I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Blue&quot; during filming of the movie. The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s song &quot;The Barracuda&quot; is featured in &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; soundtrack.

According to &quot;Kill Bill&quot; director Quentin Tarantino, he discovered the music of the 5.6.7.8&#x27;s after hearing it in an urban clothing store in Tokyo, hours before going to the airport. Tarantino asked if he could purchase the CD from the store, as he had no time to go to a music shop. When the shop assistant on duty refused, the manager was called. When Tarantino offered the manager double the retail price of the CD, he acquired it.

They also became renowned for the use of their cover of The Rock-A-Teens song, &quot;Woo Hoo&quot;, in advertisements for Carling lager and Vonage VoIP service in the mid-2000s. The song reached No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart in 2004. The follow-up song was &quot;I&#x27;m Blue&quot;; it peaked at No. 71 on the same chart two months later.

The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s have also toured many countries including China, Australia, the United States, and their native Japan. In 2019 had an important participation in Rock al Parque in Colombia, as this was the 25th edition of the iconic festival.

== Style and influences ==
The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s music draws from multiple genres of American music, including rock and roll, surf, rockabilly, doo-wop, punk rock and psychobilly. According to Yoshiko &quot;Ronnie&quot; Fujiyama, the band wanted to &quot;deconstruct rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll into punk music by using distortion and noise and screaming.&quot; The band&#x27;s influences include Chuck Berry and Sex Pistols. The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s sound has been classified as garage rock, rock and roll, garage punk, punk rock, rockabilly, roots rock, surf punk and surf rock.

<text>The Super FX is a coprocessor on the Graphics Support Unit (GSU) added to select Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) video game cartridges, primarily to facilitate advanced 2D and 3D graphics. The Super FX chip was designed by Argonaut Games, who also co-developed the 3D space rail shooter video game &quot;Star Fox&quot; with Nintendo to demonstrate the additional polygon rendering capabilities that the chip had introduced to the SNES.

==History==
The Super FX chip design team included engineers Ben Cheese, Rob Macaulay, and James Hakewill. While in development, the Super FX chip was codenamed &quot;Super Mario FX&quot; and &quot;MARIO&quot;. &quot;MARIO&quot;, a backronym for &quot;Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation, &amp; Input/Output&quot;, is printed on the face of the final production chip. The chip&#x27;s name would lead to an urban legend that &quot;Super Mario FX&quot; was a video game in development for the SNES.

Because of high manufacturing costs and increased development time, few Super FX based games were made compared to the rest of the SNES library. Due to these increased costs, Super FX games often retailed at a higher MSRP compared to other SNES games.

According to Argonaut Games founder Jez San, Argonaut had initially intended to develop the Super FX chip for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The team programmed an NES version of the first-person combat flight simulator &quot;Starglider&quot;, which Argonaut had developed for the Atari ST and other home computers a few years earlier, and showed it to Nintendo in 1990. The prototype impressed the company, but they suggested that they develop games for the then-unreleased Super Famicom due to the NES&#x27;s hardware becoming outdated in light of newer systems such as the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine. Shortly after the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show held in Chicago, Illinois, Argonaut ported the NES version of &quot;Starglider&quot; to the Super Famicom, a process which took roughly one week according to San.

==Function==
The Super FX chip is used to render 3D polygons and to assist the SNES in rendering advanced 2D effects. This custom-made RISC processor is typically programmed to act like a graphics accelerator chip that draws polygons to a frame buffer in the RAM that sits adjacent to it. The data in this frame buffer is periodically transferred to the main video memory inside of the console using DMA in order to show up on the television display.

The first version of the chip, commonly referred to as simply &quot;Super FX&quot;, is clocked with a 21.4 MHz signal, but an internal clock speed divider halves it to 10.7 MHz. Later on, the design was revised to become the Super FX GSU (Graphics Support Unit); this, unlike the first Super FX chip revision, is able to reach 21 MHz.

All versions of the Super FX chip are functionally compatible in terms of their instruction set. The differences arise in how they are packaged, their pinout, and their internal clock speed. As a result of changing the package from 100 to 112 pins when creating the GSU-2, more external pins were available and assigned for addressing. As a result, a larger amount of external ROM or RAM can be accessed.

==Usage==
&quot;Star Fox&quot; uses the chip for the rendering of hundreds of simultaneous 3D polygons. It uses scaled 2D bitmaps for lasers, asteroids, and other obstacles, but other objects such as ships are rendered with 3D polygons. &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; uses the chip for 2D graphics effects like sprite scaling and stretching.

Game cartridges that contain a Super FX chip have additional contacts at the bottom of the cartridge that connect to the extra slots in the cartridge port that are not otherwise typically used. Therefore, Super FX games cannot be plugged into cartridge adapters which predate the release of Super FX games. This includes cheat devices, such as the Game Genie.

<text>The Arch of Septimius Severus () at the northwestern end of the Roman Forum is a white marble triumphal arch dedicated in 203 AD to commemorate the Parthian victories of Emperor Septimius Severus and his two sons, Caracalla and Geta, in the two campaigns against the Parthians of 194-195 and 197–199. After the death of Septimius Severus, his sons Caracalla and Geta were initially joint Emperors. Caracalla had Geta assassinated in Rome; in the practice now known as &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, Geta&#x27;s memorials were destroyed and all images or mentions of him were removed from street buildings and monuments. Accordingly, Geta&#x27;s image and inscriptions referring to him were removed from the arch.

The Severan dynasty were avid builders of triumphal or honorary arches, especially in the Roman Empire; the Arch of Septimius Severus in the emperor&#x27;s hometown of Leptis Magna, Libya was built in the same year. The Monumental Arch of Palmyra is also sometimes called the &quot;Arch of Septimius Severus&quot;.

==Description==
The arch was raised on a travertine base originally approached by steps from the Forum&#x27;s ancient level. The central archway, spanned by a richly coffered semicircular vault, has lateral openings to each side archway, a feature copied in many Early Modern triumphal arches. The Arch is about 23 meters in height, 25 meters in width. The arch bears two sets of reliefs. The first set includes four large panels on each face of the attic and the second set consists of eight panels that are set into the inner face of the four archways.

The three archways rest on piers, which are composite columns on pedestals. Winged Victories are carved in relief in the spandrels. A staircase in the south pier leads to the top of the monument. Previously, the top of the arch had statues of the emperor and his two sons in a four-horse chariot (&quot;quadriga&quot;), accompanied by soldiers.

The master architect is unknown, but he worked with a skill level that allowed him to create the arch in a quick and traditional manner. Although traditional with the columns, piers, and cornices, the style in which the architect shows the effects of texture, and the prominent and versatile planes, show a hint of deviation from the classical style. According the scholar Richard Brilliant, the variety of styles shown on the arch signify that many different workshops and sculptors were involved. This was a way to have the commission completed quickly. Brilliant made this conclusion by identifying how the same models for the motifs have small differences throughout the reliefs. Even individual sections such as the panels, middle reliefs, and column pedestals have distinctive techniques or styles that must have come from separate artists. The differences in styles are not so drastic as to stick out, but they are enough that an expert can identify a shift. The arch also has some sections that are more detailed than the others indicating more time was spent on them, which is normal when different sculptors in a workshop work on the same object. Those who worked on the arch were taught in the Antonine style, which was known for its rich ornamentation and use of Proconnesian marble.

To help add depth to the arch, the shadows of the façade are deepened with columns and 3-D-like cornices. The façade is created in tetrastyle, where four columns are used to create a porch. The tetrastyle façade in the Severus Septimius arch is only an illusion, as it does not have a deep porch-like space behind the columns.

== Materials ==
The materials of the arch are mostly made of travertine and marble mixed in with concrete and brick. Proconnesian marble was used for the columns, Pentelic marble for the masonry, and Luna marble for the greater relief columns. The marble blocks were precisely cut in a format that made the shapes of each block rectangular. Each block, whether horizontal or vertical is fitted very closely together and it is unclear how this was possible without taking the arch apart. It is believed that the blocks of marble were cut while they were still on the ground. To avoid damage to ornamentation, the details were first roughly made while on the ground, and were later perfected and detailed once the blocks were in the proper placement. Most of the arch must have been preplanned in design and careful alignment before it was put into place. The fine details in construction show that this monument was made by some of the best professionals of the time.

== Decoration ==
Since the arch was created with the purpose of acting as a show of victory and Imperialistic propaganda, the ornamentation was essential and specific. The arch shows the vertical elevation that is common in the Roman canon of decoration and how the designer added horizontal accents.

The decorations of the attic were meant to show the achievements of the Imperial family. Evidence from Severan coins show that although no longer standing, the top of the attic used to have a chariot pulled by six horses and two riders made of gilded bronze. These sculptures most likely acted as trophy-bearers. The attic was designed to decoratively frame the inscription on the arch. This is evident through the gilding and sizing of the letters. Because the letters were gilded, the reflection on them during a sunny day would have made the sentences hard to read, but they would have been legible in the afternoon. The dowel-holes on the base of the attic show that there used to be some sort of metal ornament attached, most likely in the form of floral or trophic symbols. The attic has cornices with Lesbian cymation with a rosette around the inscription and there is double molding with an Acanthus bands as well. The arch uses the style that was common in Imperial architecture that used the Corinthian columns.

== Iconography ==
Throughout the arch, there are many reliefs. Near the spandrels of the arch entryway are flying Victorias that mark the victory of the emperor. There are four statues underneath the Victorias that represent the four seasons. Prisoners of war are shown on the pedestals nearest to the ground floor. Visitors walking through the arch would see these images, and be reminded of the imperial victories of Septimius Severus. Some of these prisoners have gloomy faces, and others have their hands behind their back while Roman soldier stands behind them. The loot and booty taken by Septimius Severus and his men are shown under the four main reliefs. The loot is being transported on a cart being pulled by a large animal. The arch has four main relief panels that show scenes of the Roman wars against the Parthian Empire.

Relief one: The arch represents the siege of Nisibis from 195 AD in the first Parthian war. The knight who stands guarding the city gate is the knight whom Septimius Severus had to protect the city of Nisibis after the war. Nisibis is shown in the first panel because it is considered the causa belli (instigator of a war) to the first war against the Parthians. The small building towards the bottom of the panel represents the Roman camp that was put up during the siege of Nisibis by the Osroeni and Adiabeni who were defeated by Severus. The multitude of figures represent the battle in which Severus defeated Osroeni and Adiabeni in the first Parthian war.

Relief two: This scene has many interpretations. One interpretation of this panel is that it is a scene of a revolt of Edessa, an ally of Rome. although the bottom section looks like a battle, it is said to be instead a surrender by king Abgrus to the emperor who stands in front of the other Edessian figures, receiving their submission. The center section shows the king surrendering to the emperor. Another theory of this panel states that this scene shows an agreement made between emperor Severus and the city of Hatra. The way the emperor holds his spear downwards implies there is a lack of aggression on his behalf. The other figure, is not kneeling which contradicts the submissive theory.

Relief three: This panel is on the capitol side and is a relief of the second Parthian campaign. Shown on the left of the relief are the Romans attacking the city of Seleucia. The figures fleeing on the left and right side are the Parthian soldiers, and the top of the relief shows the citizens who are surrendering to the Romans.

Relief four: The relief on the right facing the capitol shows the Romans taking over the city of Ctesiphon, the final battle of the Parthian war. One of the indicators that this is a siege and sacking of the city, is the large siege engine shown in the bottom left section of the panel. To the right, the city is shown surrendering to the Romans. The upper right quadrant shows emperor Septimius Severus announcing Caracalla, his eldest son, as co-ruler and Geta his youngest son, as the crowned prince.

== History ==

After the second century AD, it was common for Roman emperors to use triumphal arches to announce their achievements in a way and a place that would allow for all Romans to see. The arch is significant because it was a purposeful tool of imperialistic propaganda, created during the forming of the Roman state. It was commissioned to celebrate the Parthian Victory, but also to boast about the Severan dynasty. His victory against the Parthians started in 197 CE, when he traveled to Nisibis in Mesopotamia to take back the city that was besieged by the Parthian empire. Once he took back the Roman occupied city of Nisbis from the Parthians, he took his army to take over other Parthian cities such as Seleucia in Babylon and the capital city Ctesiphon. The wars created by Septimius Severus led to the Romans acquiring Northern Mesopotamia.

Coins with images of the arch began to be created by Septimius and Caracalla in order to show the Romans the completion of this work. It is said that the coin and the actual arch are very similar in depiction. Emperor Septimius Severus decided to name his sons Geta and Caracalla heirs to his throne where they were meant to rule alongside each other. After the Death of Septimius Severus, Geta was murdered by his brother Caracalla.

== Topography ==

Many triumphal arches are in the Sacra Via, which is the triumphal procession inside the Roman Forum. This made the arch of Septimius Severus stand out as an independent arch. Because of its positioning near the comitium, only people who got around on foot could witness the monument.

After eight years without a new Imperial commission within the Forum, the Arch of Septimius was erected. The arch was a way that the emperor could show his Roman patriotism while also keeping traditions alive. Before Septimius’ arch was erected to celebrate his victories, there was a bronze equestrian statue. The statue represented his “Pertinax Dream” where he foresaw his rise to the throne. His defeat of the Parthians was a way to “legitimize the succession” that helped Rome become a place of peace. The arch stands between the Rostra Augusti and the Cuna represent the connection between the Senate and the emperor.

== Damage ==
The most damaged area of the arch are the relief panels that are covered with erosion and dark crusting that wears away the brittle surface. The hydrocarbonic fumes together with the marble have led to chemical reactions that cause the vulnerable coating to thicken. Fire damage is evident on the first greater panel on the left because of the calcine seen on the marble. There is also damage on the cornices that project outward and on top of the arch. Besides these damaged areas, the arch is in decent condition. Skilled masons and architects of the Severan Dynasty are an essential part as to why the monument still stands throughout the wares of time and nature.

==Restoration==
The Arch stands close to the foot of the Capitoline Hill, and a little to the east, three Corinthian pillars which are the remains of the Temple of Jupiter Tonans. A flight of steps originally led to the central opening, as one still does to the Arch of Trajan at Ancona. By the 4th century, erosion had raised the level of the Forum so much that a roadway was put through the Arch for the first time. So much debris and silt eroded from the surrounding hills that the arch was embedded to the base of the columns. The damage wrought by wheeled medieval and early modern traffic can still be seen on the column bases, above the bas-reliefs of the socles.

During the Middle Ages repeated flooding of the low-lying Forum washed in so much additional sediment and debris that when Canaletto painted it in 1742, only the upper half of the Arch showed above ground. The well-preserved condition of the Arch owes a good deal to its having been incorporated into the structure of a Christian church, given 1199 by Pope Innocent III to the church of Ss. Sergio and Bacco. Half the Arch belonged to the Cimini family, who is also attributed for the preservation of the structure (Claustrum Cimini). The stronghold included a tower placed on top of the Arch itself. When the church was refounded elsewhere, the arch remained ecclesiastical property and was not demolished for other construction.

==Dedicatory inscription==

The inscription is one of the most significant characteristics of the arch. 

The dedicatory inscription on the arch reads:

In English:

&quot;To the emperor Caesar Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax Augustus Parthicus Arabicus Parthicus Adiabenicus, son of Marcus, father of his country, Pontifex Maximus, in the eleventh year of his tribunician power, in the eleventh year of his rule, consul thrice, and proconsul, and to the emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus Pius Felix, son of Lucius, in the sixth year of his tribunician power, consul, and proconsul (fathers of their country, the best and bravest emperors), on account of the restored republic and the rule of the Roman people spread by their outstanding virtues at home and abroad, The Roman Senate and People (sc. dedicate this monument)&quot;

Septimius Severus was ruling jointly as emperor with his son Caracalla (Marcus Aurelius Antoninus) when the arch was dedicated. The parenthesized section in the middle is text that replaced an original reference to his other son Geta, which was chiseled out upon Geta&#x27;s damnatio memoriae by Caracalla to erase his memory in history.

<text>The Orions are a fictional extraterrestrial humanoid species in the American science fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;, making their first appearance in the initial pilot for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;The Cage&quot;. Susan Oliver portrayed the first Orion seen on screen, when her human character Vina was transformed into one, although it was Majel Barrett who underwent the original makeup test. The footage was subsequently used in the two-part episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot;. Yvonne Craig, who was considered for the role of Vina, later played an Orion in &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot;.

Male Orions made their first appearance in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Pirates of Orion&quot; but did not appear in live action until the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Borderland&quot;, which also featured female Orions. Orion women have also been seen in the films &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, The animated series &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; depicted Orions&#x27; as a matriarchal society, and features D&#x27;Vana Tendi, an Orion as a main character. Females of the species have become known as Orion slave girls, who have become popular among fans as cosplay.

The Orions&#x27; homeworld, Orion, is located in the Orionis system, in the Orion sector of the Alpha Quadrant. It is an M class world of hills, grassland and rocky coastlines. Orion society is a carefully balanced contradiction. While the nobility and ruling elements are entrenched in criminal activity, the planet itself seems mostly free of rampant crime thanks to the strict laws preventing inter-house conflict. There is a degree of respect and maintained civility on the planet that encourages outsiders to visit and trade in safety despite it being the seat of an interstellar criminal organization.

==Development==
The first mention of the Orion was in Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s first draft script for the initial pilot for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;The Cage&quot;. At that stage, there was no further description given, except that they were to be alien in appearance. By the time that casting had been sought, it had been decided that the Orion character should be painted green, with the script stating that the character should be &quot;Wild! Green skin, glistening as if oiled&quot;. Roddenberry had convinced the NBC executives to shoot in color to reduce scenery costs and so that the green skin of the character could be seen on screen. The costume for Vina was designed by William Ware Theiss, with Roddenberry pushing for it to be skimpier. Fred Phillips conducted makeup tests before the shooting began on the episode. As an actress had not yet been cast in the role of Vina, Majel Barrett instead stepped in. Several different shades of green greasepaint were applied to her, with different camera exposures and lighting settings tested. Those test shots were sent to be developed, and received back the following day.

To the surprise of the production team, Barrett appeared normal flesh colored in all footage. They tried again, applying a much darker shade of green. Once again, when the results were received, she didn&#x27;t appear green at all. They tried a third time and the same result was received. Roddenberry phoned the development lab out of frustration, only to hear their surprise that the character was supposed to be green. They had presumed that the cinematographer had set up the camera incorrectly and had spent a great deal of time correcting Barrett back to a normal color.

A number of actresses were considered for the part, including Yvette Mimieux, Yvonne Craig, Barbara Eden and Anne Francis. Roddenberry&#x27;s first choice was Susan Oliver, whose talent agency said she was an excellent dancer. She was convinced to take the role by Oscar Katz, an executive at Desilu Productions. He didn&#x27;t attend the set in an effort to avoid Oliver, since he had undersold the difficulty of the makeup in the role.

To prepare for the Orion scenes, Oliver took a week&#x27;s worth of choreography instruction, later stating in an interview with &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine that she was not a skilled dancer. The shoot with Oliver in green paint took place on December 4, 1965, with the actress stating in a later interview that &quot;Even before the dance began and I was standing demurely to the side, this feeling was in the air. Gene had touched on something dark in man&#x27;s unconscious; one could imagine doing something with a green mate that he would never dare someone of his own color.&quot; Phillips required an assistant to keep reapplying the green Max Factor greasepaint between shots, as due to Oliver&#x27;s perspiration due to the heat from the studio lights and the dancing, it would become blotchy in patches and dry out in others. Portions of Oliver&#x27;s dancing was cut as it was deemed as too sexy, along with a scene where she is whipped. The episode was subsequently rejected by NBC as a pilot, but the footage was later used in the two-part episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot;. Unlike the other actors from &quot;The Cage&quot;, Oliver&#x27;s contract did not contain a clause to cover re-use of the footage, and so was not paid any additional fees. The first appearance of a male Orion was shown in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Pirates of Orion&quot;. An organized crime ring known as the Orion Syndicate was mentioned in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, but no actual Orions were seen, only members of other species.

===&quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; and reboot films===
Writer Mike Sussman sought to introduce the Orions into &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; with the episode &quot;Anomaly&quot;, but during rewrites this was changed into a new species called the Osaarians. During Manny Coto&#x27;s tenure as show runner in the fourth season, the Orions were re-introduced on screen for the first time since &quot;The Original Series&quot; in the episode &quot;Borderland&quot; in 2004, which was the first time that an Orion male had appeared on-screen in live action. Bobbi Sue Luther was cast as the main Orion slave girl in the episode, and she researched the history of the race on the internet prior to her performance as she was not familiar with the series before. Four hours of make-up work was required for Luther to be ready, and she described the costume as slightly skimpier than she was used to as a lingerie and bikini model. Isopropyl alcohol was used to remove the majority of the green makeup, but Luther said that it took several days for the rest to come off. Professional wrestler Big Show was one of several actors portraying male Orions in &quot;Borderland&quot;.

A further Orion-centric episode was shown later in the fourth season. Entitled &quot;Bound&quot;, there were three Orion slave girls central to the plot played by Cyia Batten, Crystal Allen and Menina Fortunato. In this case, the makeup was applied via spraying, but still took around four hours for the actresses to be ready for filming. Following the end of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, a reboot saw the franchise return to the era of &quot;The Original Series&quot; with the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; remake. Rachel Nichols was cast as an Orion named Gaila, who was involved in a relationship with James T. Kirk (Chris Pine). Her hair and makeup process took up to six hours each day, and found that it would stain Pine&#x27;s face green after they filmed a scene in which they kiss. She was disappointed not to be returning to the role for the following film, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;. Scenes were also shot for &quot;Star Trek&quot; featuring Diora Baird as a second Orion woman, but these were cut and later included as a deleted scene on the home media releases. Roberto Orci, one of the writers of the reboot films, suggested in an interview with UGO Networks that these Orion women had been released from slavery through the means of an underground railroad.

==Appearances==

The official &quot;Star Trek&quot; website describes the Orion species as being organised into a &quot;loose nation or empire&quot;, also described as the Orion Syndicate. They are known for their criminal activities, such as piracy, illegal mining and black market exploitation. The first appearance of them in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; chronology was in the &quot;Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Borderland&quot;, when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NX-01) under Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) travelled to an area of space known as the borderland, located between Klingon and Orion space. There they are attacked by two Orion ships, and several crew members are abducted. They track them down to an Orion slave market with the assistance of Arik Soong (Brent Spiner), and rescue them. In &quot;Bound&quot;, the crew are contacted by an Orion vessel captained by Harrad-Sar (William Lucking), who offers to open relations between the Orion Syndicate and Starfleet. To celebrate the new venture, Archer is presented with three Orion women Navaar (Cyia Batten), D&#x27;Nesh (Crystal Allen) and Maras (Menina Fortunato). The pheromones of the women begin to affect the crew with the exception of Subcommander T&#x27;Pol (Jolene Blalock) and Commander Charles &quot;Trip&quot; Tucker III (Connor Trinneer), who successfully work together to prevent the Orions from stealing the ship. During a conversation between Archer and Harrad-Sar, the Orion admits that it is the three women who are in charge, and he is their slave.

The Talosians seek to stimulate an attraction between Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter) and Vina (Susan Oliver) in &quot;The Cage&quot;. She was a woman who survived the crash of a spacecraft on Talos IV, and the Talosians had been projecting a series of illusions first to present her as a healthy human, but in order to begin an attraction, first as a princess from the Middle Ages, then as an Orion slave girl, and finally as a personification of Pike&#x27;s wife. These events are reviewed during a court martial against Spock (Leonard Nimoy) by Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) in &quot;The Menagerie&quot;. In &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;, the Orions attempt to disrupt a Federation conference by inserting an agent disguised as the leader of the Andorian delegation, Thelev (William O&#x27;Connell). The agent kills the leader of the Tellarite delegation, Gav (John Wheeler), implicating Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard). After the Orion injures Captain Kirk, his ruse is discovered and a pursuing Orion vessel is destroyed. In &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot;, when the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at Elba II, a planet containing an underground mental asylum, they find Garth of Izar (Steve Ihnat) impersonating the Governor of the institution. He attempts to use an Orion woman, Marta (Yvonne Craig), to influence the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew. When this fails, he exiles her to the planet&#x27;s inhospitable surface, killing her. This episode was the first occasion in the franchise that the appearance of a true Orion was shown.

The Orion Syndicate is mentioned in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; as a criminal organisation, such as in &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot; in which Chief Miles O&#x27;Brien (Colm Meaney) is placed undercover within the Syndicate by Starfleet Intelligence. In the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; remake, an alternative universe is created after the Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) and his ship the &quot;Narada&quot; travel back in time seeking revenge after the destruction of their homeworld. While James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is attending Starfleet Academy, he is romantically involved with an Orion woman named Gaila (Rachel Nichols) who is the roommate of Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana). In the sequel, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, an Orion is seen in a crowd shot of San Francisco.

&quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;, an animated series first aired in 2020, features an Orion main character for the first time, D&#x27;Vana Tendi, a science officer voiced by Noël Wells.

&quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; includes Orions in seasons 3 and 4, which are set in the 32nd century.

Season 3 of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; shows Orions on the planet of M&#x27;talas Prime as well as Orion Starfleet officers on the crew of the Titan-A. The sciences officer and operations officer on the Titan-A are the first &quot;live-action&quot; Orion Starfleet officers depicted in the Prime Universe.

==Reception==

===Fandom===

Fans of &quot;Star Trek&quot; embraced the Orions, specifically the image of the Orion slave girl, making it a popular choice for cosplay at science fiction conventions. This includes an Orion themed dance troupe called &quot;Orion&#x27;s Envy&quot;. Several fan-based &quot;Star Trek&quot; web series have been created since the end of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, including &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot; which follows on from the events of &quot;The Original Series&quot;. The second episode, &quot;Lolani&quot;, focused on the events following the murder of three Tellarite crewmembers of a cargo vessel and the discovery that an Orion slave girl survived the incident. Lou Ferrigno, famous for his role as the Hulk in the 1978 &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; television series, appeared as a similarly green male Orion.

===Critical reception===
Justin Everett, in his essay &quot;Fan Culture and the Recentering of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;, described the appearance of the Orions in the fourth season of &quot;Enterprise&quot; as an attempt by Coto to bring viewers back to the series. However, he described the Orion women themselves as providing &quot;softcore porn&quot; to the viewer. Regarding those same appearances, David Greven wrote in his book &quot;Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek&quot;, that the attraction of the men on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; demonstrated the &quot;extraordinary heterosexuality of all the &quot;Trek&quot; series&quot; as none of them can resist them, nor do any of the women feel a similar attraction. Regarding their dancing, he found that it was &quot;similar to the jerky movement of birds&quot;, referencing that the sirens of Greek mythology shared some features with humans and others with birds.

==In other media==
*&quot;The Green Girl&quot; is a 2014 biographical documentary film of Susan Oliver, so named for her role in &quot;The Cage&quot;.
*The 2015 parodic &quot;Henry Danger&quot; episode &quot;Dream Busters&quot; (the title itself a reference to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;) is almost completely set in a world made of hallucinations, one of which is an almost mute character which another hallucination names &quot;the Green Dancing Girl&quot;, clearly a reference to &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s Orions.
*In &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, season 11 episode 4, Leonard complains that the dry cleaner did not get the stain out of his Starfleet uniform. Penny remarks that he would not have to dry clean it so much if he did not make her wear the green body paint in bed, but Leonard decides that it was worth it.

<text>Andrew Michael Rourke (17 January 1964 – 19 May 2023) was an English musician best known as the bassist of the 1980s indie rock band the Smiths. Regarded as one of the greatest bassists of his generation, he was known for his melodic and funk-inspired approach to bass playing.

Rourke joined the Smiths after their first gig, having known guitarist Johnny Marr since secondary school, and played on their entire discography. After the group broke up in 1987, he performed on some of lead vocalist Morrissey&#x27;s early solo releases. Rourke recorded with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and the Pretenders in the early 1990s, and was a member of the supergroup Freebass and the band D.A.R.K., and later Blitz Vega with Kav Sandhu. He organised the Versus Cancer concerts from 2006 to 2009.

==Early life==
Rourke was born in Manchester, Lancashire, in 1964, and grew up on the Racecourse Estate in Ashton upon Mersey. His Irish father, Michael, worked as an architect; his mother, Mary (nee Stone), was English. He was raised by his father in Ashton-upon-Mersey, and later Sharston, after his mother separated from him and left the family home.

He received an acoustic guitar from his parents when he was seven years old. At the age of 11, he befriended a young John Maher (soon to be Johnny Marr) with whom he shared an interest in music: both attended St Augustine&#x27;s Grammar School in Sharston. The pair spent lunch breaks in school jamming and playing on their guitars. When Marr and Rourke formed a band, Rourke switched to bass, which he fell in love with and continued to play for the rest of his career.

Rourke left school when he was 15 and passed through a series of menial jobs, playing guitar and bass in various rock bands, as well as in the short-lived funk band Freak Party, with Marr. 

==Career==
===The Smiths===
Marr later teamed up with Morrissey to form the Smiths. Rourke joined the band after its first gig in 1982, when Marr fired original bass player Dale Hibbert, and remained through the rest of its existence. The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;, featured the track &quot;Barbarism Begins at Home&quot;, a seven-minute funk-inspired track regarded by several critics as one of Rourke&#x27;s greatest contributions. He was also praised for rockabilly-inspired basslines on the tracks &quot;Rusholme Ruffians&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;. Some of Rourke&#x27;s other noted performances include &quot;This Charming Man&quot; and &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;.

Suffering from heroin addiction, Rourke was arrested for drug possession and sacked from the band in early 1986, via a handwritten note left on his car windscreen by Morrissey. Experienced session musician Guy Pratt was brought in as a replacement and found Rourke&#x27;s compositions difficult to learn; he was relieved when Rourke was restored two weeks later, having been cleared to tour the United States. Just after Rourke&#x27;s reinstatement, the Smiths released their third studio album, &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;. In his absence, second guitarist Craig Gannon joined the band. Marr described Rourke&#x27;s contribution to that album as &quot;something no other bass player could match&quot;, and the heavy bassline on the title track as one of the best he had heard. Rourke played cello on several Smiths tracks, including &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sister&quot;, &quot;Rubber Ring&quot;, &quot;Oscillate Wildly&quot; and the Troy Tate version of &quot;Pretty Girls Make Graves&quot;. The Smiths released their fourth and final studio album &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot;, in 1987 to critical acclaim, and broke up soon after.

Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce started legal proceedings against Morrissey and Marr over royalties. Short on money due to his heroin addiction, Rourke settled out of court for £83,000 and 10% of future royalties while relinquishing all further claims; Joyce pursued the claim until 1996 and was awarded substantially more in court. Having spent the settlement, Rourke later found himself being declared bankrupt following a petition of the Inland Revenue in 1999.

=== Post-Smiths ===

==== 1990s ====

Soon after the break-up of the Smiths, Rourke and Joyce played with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. Rourke appears on her second studio album &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot; (1990). With Craig Gannon, he provided the rhythm section for two singles by Smiths vocalist Morrissey – &quot;Interesting Drug&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Famous International Playboys&quot; (both 1989). Rourke also played bass guitar on Morrissey&#x27;s &quot;November Spawned a Monster&quot; and &quot;Piccadilly Palare&quot; (both 1990) and composed the music for Morrissey&#x27;s songs &quot;Yes, I Am Blind&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Ouija Board, Ouija Board&quot;, 1989); &quot;Girl Least Likely To&quot; (a B-side on the 12-inch single of &quot;November Spawned a Monster&quot;; also released as a bonus track on the 1997 reissue of &quot;Viva Hate&quot;); and &quot;Get Off the Stage&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Piccadilly Palare&quot;).

In 1994, he worked as a session bassist with the Pretenders, appearing on six tracks on &quot;Last of the Independents,&quot; as well as working with Killing Joke, Badly Drawn Boy (with whom Rourke toured for two years), Aziz Ibrahim (formerly of the Stone Roses) and ex-Oasis guitarist Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs as Moondog One, which also included former Smiths members Joyce and Gannon. Rourke also played bass guitar for Ian Brown, both on tour and on Brown&#x27;s fifth solo studio album, &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; (2007).

==== 2000s ====

Rourke formed Freebass with bassists Mani (ex-Stone Roses) and Peter Hook (ex-New Order) in 2007 and remained active in the group until August 2010. Early in 2009, he moved to New York City, where he had a programme on East Village Radio and worked as a club DJ with Olé Koretsky under the name Jetlag. This led to Rourke and Koretsky forming the alternative rock band D.A.R.K. with Dolores O&#x27;Riordan, lead vocalist with the Cranberries. The trio released their debut studio album, &quot;Science Agrees&quot;, in 2016, through the independent label Cooking Vinyl.

In 2016, Rourke appeared on the cover of &quot;Bass Guitar&quot;.

In January 2018, it was announced that Rourke, Joyce and Gannon would take part in Classically Smiths, a series of classical music concerts based on the Smiths&#x27; discography, with the Manchester Camerata. Rourke released a statement, saying that he had never agreed to take part in the event; Joyce and Gannon subsequently withdrew and the events were cancelled.

After the death of O&#x27;Riordan, Rourke formed Blitz Vega with guitarist and vocalist Kav Sandhu, formerly of Happy Mondays. Their first single, &quot;Hey Christo&quot;, was released in 2019.

Also in 2019, Blitz Vega recorded a live EP at Abbey Road Studios and featured on Red Stripe Presents: This Feeling TV presented by Laura Whitmore and Gordon Smart. In 2022, Blitz Vega released the single &quot;Strong Forever&quot;, featuring Johnny Marr as their guest guitarist.

== Personal life ==
Rourke moved to New York City in early 2009, where he remained until his death. In 2012, he married Francesca Mor.

=== Versus Cancer ===
Rourke, his then-manager Nova Rehman, his production company, Great Northern Productions, and others organised Manchester v Cancer, a series of concerts to benefit cancer research, later known simply as Versus Cancer. The initiative was prompted when Rehman&#x27;s father and sister were diagnosed with the disease. The first Manchester v Cancer concert took place in January 2006. It featured a reunion between Rourke and his former Smiths bandmate Johnny Marr, who performed one song together. He organised further concerts in the three following years.

==Death==
On the morning of 19 May 2023, Rourke died from a &quot;lengthy&quot; battle with pancreatic cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He was 59.

All three of Rourke&#x27;s former Smiths bandmates paid tribute to him, with Morrissey writing: &quot;He didn&#x27;t ever know his own power, and nothing that he played had been played by someone else. His distinction was so terrific and unconventional and he proved it could be done...I suppose, at the end of it all, we hope to feel that we were valued. Andy need not worry about that.&quot; Johnny Marr describing Rourke as a &quot;beautiful soul by those who knew him and as a supremely gifted musician by music fans&quot;, as well as speaking about the early days of their friendship: &quot;We were best friends, going everywhere together [...] When we were fifteen I moved into his house with him and his three brothers and I soon came to realise that my mate was one of those rare people that absolutely no one doesn&#x27;t like.&quot;

==Equipment==
Throughout his career, Rourke used a Fender Precision Bass, a Fender Jazz Bass, a Yamaha BB3000 bass and others.

<text>Livinia Helen Nixon (born 19 March 1975) is an Australian television presenter and actress.

Nixon is the chief weather presenter for &quot;Nine News Melbourne&quot; and presenter on travel program &quot;Getaway&quot;.

==Career==

Nixon began her television career in 1994, making two appearances in &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; as a nurse at the local hospital. The following year, she appeared in an advertisement for &quot;Physical&quot; skim milk before she joined GTV-9 in 1997. She appeared on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Plucka&#x27;s Place&quot; in 1997, before moving to the iconic Australian show &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; as co-host, from 1997 until the show&#x27;s cancellation in late 1999. She has also worked in radio on Nova 100 in Melbourne and hosted the drive shift on TT FM with Ed Phillips for 18 months. It was during this time that she developed her on-air rapport with Phillips, which led to them to host the revamped version of &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; called &quot;Temptation&quot;. She was on this version&#x27;s entire run from 2005 until early 2009.

Nixon has also appeared on the &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Carols by Candleight&quot;, &quot;Micallef Tonight&quot;, co-hosted &quot;Weekend Today&quot;, &quot;Things To Try Before You Die&quot;, co-hosted the &quot;Logies&quot; Red Carpet Arrivals (2008–2012) and co-hosted &quot;Test Australia: The National IQ Test&quot; with Eddie McGuire. She has filed stories for &quot;Getaway&quot; from Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Samoa, Japan, France, India and around Australia.

In 2009, Nixon appeared in both &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; reunion specials. The popularity of the specials led to the revival of &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; in April the following year, in which Nixon resumed her role as co-host.

Nixon has been the chief weekday weather presenter for &quot;Nine News Melbourne&quot; since 2004.

In 2011, Livinia replaced Jaynie Seal as weather presenter on &quot;Nine Afternoon News&quot;. The national edition of &quot;Nine Afternoon News&quot; was axed in 2017 and replaced by local statewide editions. She began presenting the weather on &quot;Nine Afternoon News Melbourne&quot;.

In July 2020, Nixon joined Nine Radio to host weekend breakfast across 2UE 954, Magic 1278, 4BH 882 and 6GT DAB+.

In November 2020, Nine announced that Nixon will host &quot;Carols by Candlelight&quot; with David Campbell. However, due to COVID-19 border restrictions, it was announced she would be presenting with Eddie McGuire.

==Education==
Nixon was educated at Lauriston Girls&#x27; School as well as Deakin University. She has also completed a Graduate Diploma in Applied Science at Melbourne University.

==Personal life==
She grew up in the affluent Melbourne suburb of Toorak.

Nixon is an ambassador for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and World Vision. She also travelled to parts of Thailand with World Vision after the tsunami in December 2004.

Nixon is married and has two sons.

She is a keen Richmond Football Club supporter.

<text>The Mark 60 CAPTOR (Encapsulated Torpedo) is the United States&#x27; only deep-water anti-submarine naval mine. It uses a Mark 46 torpedo contained in an aluminum shell that is anchored to the ocean floor. The mine can be placed by either aircraft, submarine or surface vessel. The torpedo, once placed, can last anywhere from weeks to months underwater. The original production contract of the CAPTOR mine was awarded to Goodyear Aerospace in 1972, and entered service in 1979. It was hoped to reduce minefield costs and used in the creation of a barrier of the &quot;Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap to interrupt Soviet submarines in the event that deterrence failed.&quot;

The mine uses Reliable Acoustic Path (RAP) sound propagation to passively identify and track the difference between hostile submarine signatures, surface vessels and friendly submarines. Once identified, the torpedo leaves its casing to destroy its target.

<doc id="1105162" wikidata="Q3427977" url="?curid=1105162" title="Danny Jordaan">
<text>Daniel Alexander &quot;Danny&quot; Jordaan (born 3 September 1951) is the president of the South African Football Association (SAFA). He is a former lecturer, politician and anti-apartheid activist. He led South Africa&#x27;s successful 2010 FIFA World Cup bid, the first successful one for Africa, as well as the country&#x27;s unsuccessful bid four years earlier for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and was the chief executive officer of the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa. He is also the former Mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, having served from May 2015 until August 2016.

He has served FIFA in numerous capacities, including, as a General Co-ordinator for the Youth World Cup (now FIFA U-20 World Cup), 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea/Japan. He was also a match commissioner for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and a member of the 2006 FIFA World Cup Organising Committee. He served on the 2010 FIFA World Cup Organising Committee and 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup Organising Committee.

Jordaan is also a member of the International Marketing Council.

==Career==
Danny Jordaan was born in Port Elizabeth to Maxine and Alexandre Jordaan. He became involved in anti-apartheid activities by joining the South African Students&#x27; Organisation (SASO) in the early 1970s, an organisation founded by Steve Biko in order to defend the rights of black students. Later, Jordaan also became a member of the United Democratic Front and the African National Congress (ANC).

Following his studies, Jordaan became a teacher in 1974. From 1970 to 1983 he was a provincial cricket and football player. In the latter sport, he achieved professional status for a brief period. His political and sport interests soon combined and he became an activist in various organizations fighting to break down racial barriers in sport.

From 1983 to 1992 he served as the president or vice-president of various football boards. In 1993, he was appointed as a director of the Cape Town Olympic Bid Company.

His political career also progressed; in 1990 he was elected as the chairperson of the ANC branch in Port Elizabeth North. After the first fully inclusive South African elections in 1994, he became a member of parliament for the ANC under the newly elected Nelson Mandela, a position he held until 1997.

In 1997, he was elected as the chief executive officer of SAFA. He subsequently headed South Africa&#x27;s unsuccessful 2006 FIFA World Cup bid, narrowly losing to Germany but gaining great respect internationally for his work. As a consequence, he also led South Africa&#x27;s 2010 FIFA World Cup bid, this time successfully.

Jordaan has served on the marketing and television board of FIFA since 1998.

On 28 September 2013, Jordaan was elected as the new president of South African Football Association (SAFA), succeeding Kirsten Nematandani. He was elected ahead of Mandla Mazibuko by 162 to 88 votes from 52 regions.

In light of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Jordaan admitted to paying $10 Million to a football body led by Jack Warner in 2008, but denied that it was a bribe for hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

On 13 November 2024, Jordaan was arrested on suspicion of embezzling R1.3 million ($72,372) of SAFA&#x27;s funds to hire public relations and security firms for personal use.

==Education==
Jordaan has a BA degree from the University of the Western Cape and an honours degree from the University of South Africa.

==Awards==
He received a special presidential award from President Nelson Mandela in 1994 as well as the presidential sport achievement award from President Thabo Mbeki in 2001. He won South Africa&#x27;s marketing person of the year award in 2000. In 2004, he was voted 44th in the Top 100 Great South Africans and newsmaker of the year. He received a mayoral award from the mayor of Los Angeles, California on 24 October 2004. That same year, he won the Confederation of African Football&#x27;s &quot;most impressive Achiever&quot; alongside Molefi Oliphant and Irvin Khosa.
He was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga in Gold in 2011 for ensuring that South Africa hosted a successful 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Jordaan has been given the freedom of the city of Maracaibo, Venezuela. He has also received numerous awards from other South African cities.

He has received four honorary doctorates from: Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (D.Phil); the University of South Africa (D. Admin); his alma mater, the University of the Western Cape (D. Phil); and in May 2015 from the University of Fort Hare (D. Admin).

==Rape allegations==
In November 2017, Jordaan issued a statement through his attorney to deny allegations by singer and former parliamentarian Jennifer Ferguson that he had raped her 24 years before. Ferguson first posted her allegations on Facebook in October, saying she had been inspired to do so by the #MeToo campaign. Ferguson later accused lawyer Norman Arendse of fishing for information that could be used to discredit her, on Jordaan&#x27;s behalf. Arendse denied both claims. An allegation that Jordaan had failed to act against an employee who had been accused of rape had been made in the week following Ferguson&#x27;s allegation by an anonymous source but the claim was refuted by SAFA. Until Jordaan&#x27;s statement, some South African publications refused to name him, even as others did. In April 2018 Jordaan through his attorney called on the South African Police Service to expedite their investigation so that the truth could be revealed. He again denied the allegations.
 Some media questioned whether the rape allegations were part of a political plot to discredit Jordaan ahead of the highly contested SAFA elections that were due to take place in March 2018. Jordaan was widely expected to be unanimously reelected President of the body that administers football in the country.

<doc id="1105163" wikidata="Q7740893" url="?curid=1105163" title="The Humane Interface">
<text>The Humane Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems () is a book about user interface design written by Jef Raskin and published in 2000. It covers ergonomics, quantification, evaluation, and navigation.

==Contents==

The book puts forward a large number of interface design suggestions, from fairly trivial ones to radical ones. The overriding theme is that current computer interfaces are often poor and set up users to fail, as a result of poor planning (or lack of planning) by programmers and a lack of understanding of how people actually use software.

Raskin often refers to the computer he designed, the Canon Cat, as an example of a system that implemented the various measures he advocates. The Canon Cat is often considered the first information appliance. Many of the ideas presented in the Canon Cat and &quot;The Humane Interface&quot; were later adopted by Raskin in his Archy project, and later by his son Aza.

Raskin includes a chapter demonstrating four models of quantifying the efficiency of a software interface: the GOMS keystroke model, Raskin&#x27;s own efficiency measure, Fitts&#x27; law and Hick&#x27;s law. All are intended to minimize the amount of time required for the user to perform any specific task.

=== Design rules ===

Raskin also advocates a number of changes to conventional interface design. Among them:

* Modelessness a mode is a state in which the computer produces a different output for the same input than it would have if it were another state; the classic example is the keyboard&#x27;s &quot;caps lock&quot; key. Raskin advocates either getting rid of them entirely or using &quot;quasimodes&quot; (a term he invented in the book); a quasimode is a state in which the user must make some constant physical action in order to keep the computer in that state, so that they cannot forget that they are in that mode; an example is the keyboard&#x27;s shift key.
* Monotony of design there should be only one way to accomplish a certain atomic task in an application (in many modern applications, there are at least three - one through a button on the screen, one through a menu dropdown, and one through a keyboard shortcut and often more).
* Universal undo/redo every action should be undoable and redoable, even after a document or application has been closed and reopened.
* Elimination of warning screens modern software applications often ask the user &quot;are you sure?&quot; before some potentially harmful action; Raskin argues they are unhelpful because users tend to ignore them out of habit, and that having a universal undo eliminates the need for them.
* Universal use of text Raskin argues that graphic icons in software without any accompanying text are often cryptic to users.

Habituation is an important concept driving Raskin&#x27;s guidelines, intended to free the user&#x27;s mind from attention to low-level interaction details. A modeless interface, monotony of design and elimination of blocking warnings are all intended to favor habit-forming reactions to interface handling.

=== Non-standard interaction architecture ===

Raskin also advocates a document-centered approach to computer interfaces that entails several radical changes to the current nature of operating systems and software:

* An end to stand-alone applications every software package should be structured as a set of tools available to users on any document. For example, in the middle of writing a text document, a user should be able to do a mathematical computation by writing out the computation in the document, then hitting some &quot;calculate&quot; function.
* An end to directories and file names &quot;the content of a text file is its own best name.&quot; Every document should be identifiable by its contents, so there should not be need for directories or names for user-generated documents; Raskin argues that these names tend to be cryptic and make files difficult to find afterwards.
* Zooming user interface Raskin advocates an interface he calls ZoomWorld, in which the user navigates around a two-dimensional plane containing a graphical representation of every document on the computer. The user can zoom out to see all the documents, or zoom in on any specific document in order to read and edit it.

Raskin further asserts that interface design should be subject to regulation, analogous to building codes. This could be done by establishing legal safeguards to protect consumers from harm, and establishing professional guidelines and standards to evaluate good practice and interface quality.

==The &quot;Kangi&quot; Famine (1229–1232)==
&quot;Between 1229 and 1232, the Kanki famine struck. Possibly the worst famine in Japanese history, it was caused by unusually cold, damp weather related to world-wide volcanic activity. The weather was so severe that snow fell in central Japan in the summer of 1230, while aristocrats noted days when the sun did not shine and complained because they had to wear heavy clothing even in the spring and summer. The death toll was high—in 1231, in one estate in central Japan about twenty percent of cultivators died in less than a month.&quot;

&quot;Both governments attempted to ameliorate the harsh conditions but to little avail. Law and order broke down; countermeasures against nocturnal marauders and “evil monks” were largely ineffectual. Outlawry even affected relations with the Korean kingdom of Koryō when hungry residents of Kyushu raided the neigh boring peninsula for food. The famine also led to numerous quarrels between on-site warrior landlords and urban proprietors, with many estates unable to pay taxes or organize labor gangs. When harvests were inadequate, warriors also pressured and abused hapless cultivators, driving them from their fields. Both Kyoto and Kamakura took steps to make more grain available to commoners, but the results of their actions were only modest.&quot;

&quot;The most important countermeasure taken to try to reduce the impact of the lengthy crop failure was the legalization of the sale of human beings. When a family was faced with starvation, members might choose to sell children or other kin in return for grain, at the same time ensuring enough to eat for the sellers and the person to be sold. This behavior had been going on illegally for centuries, but its official authorization from 1231 to 1239 showed just how severe the Kangi famine was. The policy helped to spread starving victims around to people who could take care of them, but it also ripped more families asunder.&quot;

&quot;In addition, all those sold became members of a servile class, dwelling in small lean-tos or perhaps even in a room of their master&#x27;s house. These conditions did not encourage large. stable families. The new policy may have saved some lives, but the creation of so many dependent, broken, and poor families helped lower fertility, making recovery from the famine even more difficult. After the famine in 1239, the bakufu tried to abrogate the more lenient laws, without success. The famine expanded the size of the servile class considerably; it was to remain a significant proportion of Japanese society for the next four hundred years[ ... ]&quot;

<doc id="1105172" wikidata="Q660702" url="?curid=1105172" title="Further Austria">
<text>Further Austria, Outer Austria or Anterior Austria (; , formerly &quot;die Vorlande&quot; (pl.)) was the collective name for the early (and later) possessions of the House of Habsburg in the former Swabian stem duchy of south-western Germany, including territories in the Alsace region west of the Rhine and in Vorarlberg.

While the territories of Further Austria west of the Rhine and south of Lake Constance (except Konstanz itself) were gradually lost to France and the Swiss Confederacy, those in Swabia and Vorarlberg remained under Habsburg control until the Napoleonic Era.

==Geography==
Further Austria mainly comprised the Alsatian County of Ferrette in the Sundgau, including the town of Belfort, and the adjacent Breisgau region east of the Rhine, including Freiburg im Breisgau after 1368. Also ruled from the Habsburg residence in Ensisheim near Mühlhausen were numerous scattered territories stretching from Upper Swabia to the Allgäu region in the east, the largest being the margravate of Burgau between the cities of Augsburg and Ulm. During the Habsburg monarchy they were humorously called &quot;tail feathers of the Imperial Eagle&quot;. Some estates in Vorarlberg possessed by the Habsburgs were also considered part of Further Austria, though they were temporarily directly administered from Tyrol.

==History==
The original home territories of the Habsburgs, the Aargau with Habsburg Castle and much of the other original possessions south of the High Rhine and Lake Constance were already lost in the 14th century to the expanding Swiss Confederacy after the battles of Morgarten (1315) and Sempach (1386). These territories were never considered part of Further Austria – except for the Fricktal region around Rheinfelden and Laufenburg, which remained a Habsburg possession until 1797.

From 1406 until 1490, Further Austria together with the Habsburg County of Tyrol was included in the definition of &quot;Upper Austria&quot; (&quot;Oberösterreich&quot;, not to be confused with the modern Austrian state of Upper Austria). From 1469 to 1474 Archduke Sigismund gave large parts in pawn to the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold. In the reign of Emperor Maximilian I, the influence of Further Austria increased, with its significance matching that of Burgundy, as the proportion of courtiers from Further Austria greatly increased.

At the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the Sundgau became part of France. After the Ottoman wars, many inhabitants of Further Austria were encouraged to emigrate and settle in the newly acquired Transylvania region, people that later were referred as Danube Swabians. In the 18th century, the Habsburgs acquired a few minor new Swabian territories, such as Tettnang in 1780.

In the reorganization of the Holy Roman Empire in the course of the French Revolutionary Wars, much of Further Austria, including the Breisgau, was by the 1801 Treaty of Lunéville granted as compensation to Ercole III d&#x27;Este, former duke of Modena and Reggio, who however died two years later. His heir as his son-in-law was Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, the uncle of Emperor Francis II.

After the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz and the Peace of Pressburg in 1805, Further Austria was entirely dissolved and the former Habsburg territories were assigned to the Grand Duchy of Baden (Breisgau), the Kingdom of Württemberg (Rottenburg and Horb) and the Kingdom of Bavaria (Weitnau, Günzburg, Weißenhorn), as rewards for their alliance with Napoleonic France. Minor estates passed to Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Fricktal had already become a French protectorate in 1799 and part of the Helvetic Republic in 1802, incorporated into the Swiss canton of Aargau the next year.

After the defeat of Napoleon, there was some discussion at the Congress of Vienna of returning part or all of the &quot;Vorlande&quot; to Austria, but in the end only Vorarlberg returned to Austrian control, as Foreign Minister Klemens von Metternich did not want to offend the rulers of the South German states and hoped that removing Austria from its advanced position on the Rhine would reduce tensions with France.

==Administrative division==
As of 1790 Further Austria was subdivided into ten districts (&quot;Oberämter&quot;):
*Breisgau (with Fricktal) at Freiburg
*Offenburg: several localities in the present Ortenaukreis, the Imperial city of Offenburg not included
*Hohenberg, present Ostalbkreis, former county, at Rottenburg am Neckar
*Nellenburg, former landgraviate, at Stockach
*Altdorf (former Vogtei Swabia), today Weingarten
*Tettnang, former County of Montfort
*Günzburg, former Margraviate of Burgau
*Winnweiler in the Palatinate, former County of Falkenstein
*the former Imperial city of Konstanz
*Bregenz, present-day Vorarlberg, then administered from Tyrol.

==Habsburg rulers==
Politically, the Further Austrian territories were held by the Habsburg (Arch-)Dukes of Austria from 1278 onwards. Upon the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, they together with Carinthia, Styria, Carniola and Tyrol fell to the Leopoldian line:
*Leopold III, until 1386
*William, son, 1386–1406
Further divided into Inner Austria proper (Styria, Carinthia and Carniola) and Upper Austria (Tyrol and Further Austria), ruled by:
*Frederick IV, younger brother of William, 1406-1439 (regent in Further Austria since 1402)
*Frederick V, nephew of William, ruler of Inner Austria, 1439-1446 (regent)
*Sigismund, son of Frederick IV, 1446–1490
In 1490 all Habsburg possessions were re-unified under the rule of Frederick V, Holy Roman Emperor since 1452. Upon the death of Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg in 1564, Further Austria and Tyrol was inherited by his second son:
*Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, 1564–1595
*Matthias, 1595–1619, nephew, Holy Roman Emperor from 1612, with his younger brother
**Maximilian III as regent, 1612–1618
In 1619 the Habsburg hereditary lands were re-unified under the rule of Emperor Ferdinand II. He gave Further Austria to his younger brother:
*Leopold V, 1623–1632
*Ferdinand Charles, son, 1632–1662
**under the tutelage of his mother Claudia de&#x27; Medici, 1632–1646
*Sigismund Francis, brother 1662-1665
In 1665 the Habsburg lands were finally re-unified under the rule of Emperor Leopold I.

<text>The Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) (), generally abbreviated as KPO or KPD(O), was a communist opposition organisation established at the end of 1928 and maintaining its existence until 1939 or 1940. After the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party to power in January 1933, the KPO existed only as an illegal and underground organization. The group initially sought to modify, later to replace, the mainstream Communist Party of Germany (KPD) headed by Ernst Thälmann. The KPO was the first national section affiliated to the International Communist Opposition (ICO).

== Organizational history ==
=== Background ===
The KPO represented the so-called Right Opposition in the KPD in distinction to the Trotskyist or Trotskyist-sympathising Left Opposition and the pro-Comintern centre faction. It was led by Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer who had led the KPD between 1921 and 1923. They were expelled from the KPD after organising a meeting to combat what they saw as corruption in their party after its central leader Ernst Thälmann defended a protégé, John Wittorf, from charges of theft despite his guilt. Thälmann was deposed by the Central Committee only to be reinstated by Joseph Stalin through the agency of the Comintern.

The secretary of the Hamburg organization of the KPD was found to have embezzled 2,000 marks from the party treasury for his own use. When accountants from national party headquarters discovered the crime, they were threatened with expulsion from the party by party leader Thälmann if they exposed the theft. The Comintern got wind of the scandal which led to a crisis in the German party with the Central Committee acting to remove Thälmann, with Thälmann joining in the unanimous vote. This presented a threat to the faction of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Joseph Stalin, who saw in Thälmann a reliable ally during a time of bitter factional warfare. As a result, the Presidium of the Comintern countermanded the German Central Committee&#x27;s action, restoring Thälmann as secretary.

In October 1928, Brandler returned to Germany against the KPD&#x27;s wishes. The corruption of Thälmann&#x27;s Hamburg organization and its protection by the Stalin faction in Moscow was used as a pretext for Brandler and Thalheimer to issue a call for a meeting of their followers on 11 November 1928. Brandler, Thalheimer and their associates were bitterly criticized in an open letter from the Comintern on 19 December. Expulsion soon followed, with both Brandler and Thalheimer removed from the Communist Party of Germany in December 1928 and from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Comintern in January 1929.

=== Formation ===
Brandler and Thalheimer gathered their supporters into a new organization called the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) (KPO), a group which was founded at the 30 December 1928 meeting which had originally prompted the wave of expulsions. The group also launched a new communist opposition journal, &quot;Gegen den Strom&quot; (&quot;Against the Current&quot;).

Most of those who attended this conference were factional allies of Brandler and Thalheimer from previous years when they had headed the German Communist Party. The major exception was Paul Frölich, who had been allied with a third, so-called Conciliator faction which stood between the future KPO and the KPD leadership. Frölich and his partner Rosi Wolfstein, like Brandler and Thalheimer, had been allies and pupils of Rosa Luxemburg.

Throughout 1929, the KPD expelled followers of Brandler and Thalheimer as well as the Conciliator faction, who sought a factional truce between the party&#x27;s feuding left and right. Perhaps 1,000 members of the German Communist Party were affected. These expulsions paralleled similar efforts to purge the Soviet Communist Party of followers of Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov and Mikhail Tomsky.

The KPO initially conceived of itself as a factional influence group, attempting to change the political line of the Communist Party of Germany rather than a new party in competition with it. The organization held a second conference in November 1929 at which in the words of M. N. Roy it &quot;declared unequivocally that between Social Democracy and Communism there is no half-way house&quot;. Roy claimed that the KPO had 6,000 dues-paying members and was publishing eight weekly and bi-monthly publications by the fall of 1929, with a combined circulation of 25,000. Brandler was named Secretary of the organization at this time. While the group never met with broad influence or electoral success, it nevertheless became the first as well as one of the most prominent parties to be identified with the so-called International Right Opposition.

On 1 January 1930, the KPO attempted to expand its influence even further with the launch of a daily newspaper, &quot;Arbeiterpolitik.&quot; Financial problems led it a reduction of frequency and by 1932 the paper was being issued only once a week. Despite Roy&#x27;s protestations that the KPO did not constitute an independent political party, it was not long before it had entered the field with its own candidates for office. It ran its own candidates in the 7 December 1929 provincial election in Thuringia, one of the organization&#x27;s strongholds, although these garnered just 12,000 votes. In other elections, it supported the slate of candidates of the official Communist Party of Germany, including the candidacy of Ernst Thälmann for President in the election of March 1932.

The KPO counted approximately 1,000 members after its supporters had been expelled from the KPD, many of them local leaders of the party. In the years that followed, they failed to recruit any further adherents from outside the party and gradually decreased in number. The KPO backed the KPD on most public issues, but it did stand their own candidates in some elections and ran other campaigns. Their members were also active in the existing trade unions in contrast to the KPD which launched a policy of forming radical dual unions during the so-called Third Period between 1929 and 1934.

=== Drive for a united front against fascism ===
In the period when the KPD was denouncing the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as social fascists and retreating from joint anti-fascist work with non-Communists, Brandler and the KPO were strongly in favor of the establishment of a united front against the menace of Nazism and were particularly critical of the Communist Party&#x27;s conception that &quot;once the Nazis get into power, then will the united front of the proletariat rise and brush them aside&quot;. Instead, the KPO called for the immediate formation of a broad anti-fascist alliance including the Social Democratic-controlled trade union federation, the Social Democrats, Communists and the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (SAPD).

Campaigning for a united front as a small group did not give the KPO more influence with the general public, but the threat of the Nazis did lead to a leftward movement within the SPD. This leftist tendency in the SPD left that party in 1931 and organised themselves as the SAPD which elements within the KPO felt they should join. After an internal struggle in which the majority of the KPO backed Brandler and Thalheimer, a minority led by Frölich and Jacob Walcher refused to accept the decisions of the fourth conference of the KPO held in January 1932. The leadership replied to this challenge by stating that the breach of discipline implied the minority had excluded itself from the organisation. The minority responded by joining the SAPD.

On 10 August 1932, the KPO weekly &quot;Arbeiterpolitik&quot; was banned for 13 weeks for violating President Paul von Hindenburg&#x27;s emergency decree &quot;against political excesses&quot; by the conservative German government headed by Chancellor Franz von Papen. The ban was to take effect immediately, continuing until 15 November. The ban, along with similar measures taken against other organs of the left-wing press, helped make coordinated action against German ultranationalism more difficult.

Following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his ultranationalist Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 and the wave of anti-radical repression which ensued, Brandler and most of the KPO leadership fled to France. Brandler lived in Paris until the beginning of World War II, where he continued to be involved in communist politics.

=== Underground period ===
The KPO was only able to work legally for one more year before the Nazis came to power in January 1933. However, it was to go underground immediately in order to avoid persecution as far as possible. They were able to hold a conference in Denmark in April 1934 and maintain a national structure. In 1935, the Nazis stepped up the repression of all communist groups and trials of KPO members were reported in Weimar, Jena and elsewhere. The organisation ceased to operate at a national level and was now confined to exile circles and the Saarland. In the Saarland, they were able to function legally for a little longer due to its status as a French occupation zone. When a plebiscite was held on the matter of the region being returned to Germany, the KPO called on its supporters to vote for a &quot;Räterepublik&quot; (soviet) Saarland and to oppose unity with Nazi Germany. This was in contrast to the position of the KPD which supported the Saarland remaining under the control of France.

In exile with the leadership in Paris, the KPO continued to publish &quot;Gegen den Strom&quot;. Politically, it continued the previous line of the KPO and was supportive of the Comintern and of the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union, its criticisms being reserved for the KPD. This began to change with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War and the deepening of the Great Purges in Russia. A number of KPO militants in exile were to travel to Spain and fought in the International Brigades that supported the Second Spanish Republic. Some were to find themselves persecuted by the Stalinists, a fate they shared with militants belonging to the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM).

=== Dissolution ===
There seems to have been a tendency within the KPO which wanted it to break more clearly from any support of Stalinism and in 1939 a Group of International Marxists appeared after its founders left the ranks of the KPO. This group signed a declaration of independent socialist parties, many associated with the International Workers&#x27; Front which had left the ICO and KPO. From this point on, there is little mention of either the new group or the KPO itself, with the fall of France, the leadership of the KPO had been forced to flee again and the organisation was effectively dissolved. Of the leading figures in the KPO, Brandler and Thalheimer were to spend the war exiled in Cuba, where the latter was to perish. Brandler returned to West Germany in 1949 and played a leading role in the which stood in the tradition of the KPO, but he was never able to recover its former influence. Brandler died in 1967, but the group still exists and is based in Hamburg.

<text>Sir Andrew Barton (c. 1466 – 2 August 1511) was a Scottish sailor from Leith. He gained notoriety as a privateer, making raids against Portuguese ships. He was killed in battle and memorialised in English and Scottish folk songs.

==Career==
Some of Andrew Barton&#x27;s trading voyages to Flanders ports in the 1490s are recorded in the &quot;Ledger of Andrew Halyburton&quot;. He was the oldest of three brothers; a younger brother, Robert Barton of Over Barnton, became Lord High Treasurer of Scotland.

Andrew became notorious in England and Portugal as a &#x27;pirate&#x27;, though as a seaman who operated under the aegis of a letter of marque on behalf of the Scottish crown, he may be described as a privateer. The letter of marque against Portuguese shipping was originally granted to his father, John Barton, by James III of Scotland before 1485. John&#x27;s ships had been attacked by Portuguese vessels when he was trading at Sluis in Flanders.

James IV revived the letters in July 1507. When Barton, sailing in the &quot;Lion&quot;, tried to take reprisals against Portuguese ships in 1508, he was detained by Dutch authorities at Veere. James IV had to write to Maximilian, the Holy Roman Emperor, and others to get him released in 1509. Andrew then took a Portuguese ship which carried an English cargo, leading to more difficulties, and James IV had to suspend the letter of marque for a year. Andrew captured a ship of Antwerp in 1509, the &quot;Fasterinsevin&quot; (Scots for &quot;Shrove Tuesday&quot;; the name in Dutch would have been &quot;Vastenavond&quot;), which did not come within his letter of marque. James IV ordered him to recompense Captain Peter Lempson and his officers for her cargo of woad and canvas.

The Bartons were in demand to support John, King of Denmark, and were allowed by him to harass the shipping of Lübeck. In return for this service, John of Denmark sent James IV timber for the masts of his ships from Flensburg. Andrew joined John&#x27;s service briefly in the spring of 1511, but sailed away without permission, also taking a ship that James IV had given to John.

==Last battle==

Later in 1511, Andrew Barton was cruising the English coast looking for Portuguese prizes when he and his ships the &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Jenny Pirwyn&quot; were captured after a fierce battle with Sir Edward Howard and his brother Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, off Kent at the Downs. According to the story told in ballads, Andrew was shot and killed by an English archer during the battle and subsequently beheaded, his head being taken to Henry VIII as evidence of his death. 

The incident was recalled two years later in the exchange of rhetoric at the battle of Flodden. The story of the sea-battle was told by Raphael Holinshed and in other 16th-century English chronicles. In Holinshed&#x27;s story the Howards at first pretended only to approach and salute Andrew Barton, but then engaged in battle, Barton&#x27;s ship was the &quot;Unicorn&quot; and he died from his wounds. The Scottish survivors were taken to London and kept prisoner in the Bishop of York&#x27;s lodging, York Place at Whitehall. Edward Hall wrote that Andrew encouraged his men during the fight with his whistle. Hall mentions that the two ships were brought to Blackwall on 2 August 1511, and the prisoners were freed after an interview with the Bishop of Winchester, after acknowledging their piracy.

The Scottish bishop John Lesley gave a similar account of the battle in his chronicle. George Buchanan has the detail that Andrew Barton continued fighting after his leg was broken by a gunshot, and encouraged his sailors by beating a drum before he died from his wounds. Buchanan emphasises that the Howards sailed on the instruction of Henry VIII following a representation by a Portuguese ambassador. Hall wrote that Henry VIII was at Leicester when he ordered the Howards to chase the Scottish ships.

==In popular culture==
He is the subject of a traditional folk song entitled &quot;Sir Andrew Barton&quot; or &quot;Andrew Bartin,&quot; which is Child ballad number 167. In some versions, &quot;Sir Barton&quot; says:
His story is also told in &quot;Henry Martyn&quot;, another Child ballad (number 250), which seems to be a later evolution of the original ballad.

Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story connected with Barton in his Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill series.

==Notable descendants==
The Stedman family of which there have been a number of notable members, such as Charles Stedman (1753–1812) and John Gabriel Stedman (1744–1797) have a tradition that Andrew Barton left an only son, Charles, who married Susan Stedman of Leith and took his wife&#x27;s name. Another notable member was John Andrew Stedman (1778–1833) who was general in the Dutch army during the Napoleonic Wars (his father was a naturalised Dutchman who had been in the Scots Brigade in the service of the States-General of the Netherlands). His son Charles John William Stedman became a Prussian subject, settling at Besselich Abbey, near Coblentz. He was a member of the national assemblies of Frankfurt am Main and Erfurt, and received the title of &quot;freiherr&quot; (baron). He had a large family, of which nearly all the sons entered the Queen Augusta Regiment of Guards; they reverted to the original family name of Barton.

<text>Claremont, also known historically as &#x27;Clermont&#x27;, is an 18th-century Palladian mansion less than a mile south of the centre of Esher in Surrey, England. The buildings are now occupied by Claremont Fan Court School, and its landscaped gardens are owned and managed by the National Trust. Claremont House is a Grade I listed building.

==Claremont estate==
The first house on the Claremont estate was built in 1708 by Sir John Vanbrugh, the Restoration playwright and architect of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard, for his own use. This &quot;very small box&quot;, as he described it, stood on the level ground in front of the present mansion. At the same time, he built the stables and the walled gardens, also probably White Cottage, which is now the Sixth Form Centre of Claremont Fan Court School.

In 1714, he sold the house to the wealthy Whig politician Thomas Pelham-Holles, Earl of Clare, who later became Duke of Newcastle and served twice as Prime Minister. The Earl commissioned Vanbrugh to add two great wings to the house and to build a fortress-like turret on an adjoining knoll. From this so-called &quot;prospect-house&quot;, or belvedere, he and his guests could admire the views of the Surrey countryside as they took refreshments and played hazard, a popular dice game.

In the clear eighteenth-century air it was apparently possible to see Windsor Castle and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The Earl of Clare named his country seat Clare-mount, later contracted to Claremont. The two lodges at the Copsem Lane entrance were added at this time.

==Landscape garden==

Claremont landscape garden is one of the earliest surviving gardens of its kind of landscape design, the English Landscape Garden — still featuring its original 18th century layout. The extensive landscaped grounds of Claremont represents the work of some of the best known landscape gardeners, Charles Bridgeman, Capability Brown, William Kent (with Thomas Greening) and Sir John Vanbrugh.

Work on the gardens began around 1715 and, by 1727, they were described as &quot;the noblest of any in Europe&quot;. Within the grounds, overlooking the lake, is an unusual turfed amphitheatre.

A feature in the grounds is the Belvedere Tower, designed by Vanbrugh for the Duke of Newcastle. The tower is unusual in that, what appear to be windows, are actually bricks painted black and white. It is now owned by Claremont Fan Court School, which is situated alongside the gardens.

In 1949, the landscape garden was donated to the National Trust for stewardship and protection. A restoration programme was launched in 1975 following a significant donation by the Slater Foundation. The garden is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==Capability Brown&#x27;s mansion, built for Lord Clive of India==

The Duke of Newcastle died in 1768 and, in 1769, his widow sold the estate to Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive, founder of Britain&#x27;s Indian Empire. Although the great house was then little more than fifty years old, it was aesthetically and politically out of fashion. Lord Clive decided to demolish the house and commissioned Capability Brown to build the present Palladian mansion on higher and dryer ground. Brown, more accomplished as a landscape designer than an architect, took on his future son-in-law Henry Holland as a junior partner owing to the scale of the project. John Soane was employed in Holland&#x27;s office at this time and worked on the project as a draftsman and junior designer. Holland&#x27;s interiors for Claremont owe much to the contemporary work of Robert Adam.

Lord Clive, by now a rich Nabob, is reputed to have spent over £100,000 on rebuilding the house and the complete remodelling of the celebrated pleasure ground. However, Lord Clive ended up never living at the property, as he died in 1774—the year that the house was completed. The estate then passed through a rapid succession of owners; first being sold &quot;for not more than one third of what the house and alterations had cost&quot; to Robert Monckton-Arundell, 4th Viscount Galway, and then to George Carpenter, 2nd Earl of Tyrconnell, and finally to Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford.

A large map entitled &quot;Claremont Palace&quot;, situated in what is called &quot;Clive&#x27;s room&quot; inside the mansion, shows the mansion and its surrounding grounds; giving a detailed overview of the campus. The map likely dates back to the 1860s, when the mansion was frequently occupied by Queen Victoria (thus it having been christened &quot;palace&quot;). However, the exact date is still unknown. The relief in Claremont&#x27;s front pediment is of Clive&#x27;s coat of arms impaled with that of Maskelyne, his wife&#x27;s family.

==Royal residence==
In 1816, Claremont was bought by the British Nation through an Act of Parliament as a wedding present for George IV&#x27;s daughter Princess Charlotte and her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. At that time, the estate was valued to Parliament at £60,000: &quot;Mr Huskisson stated that it had been agreed to purchase the house and demesnes of Clermont... The valuation of the farms, farm-houses, and park, including 350 acres of land, was 36,000/; the mansion, 19,000/; and the furniture, 6,000/; making together 60,000/. The mansion, which is in good repair, could not be built now for less than 91,000/.&quot; To the nation&#x27;s great sorrow, however, Princess Charlotte, who was second in line to the throne, was, after two miscarriages, to die there after giving birth to a stillborn son in November the following year. This sorrow is expressed in Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem Lines on the Mausoleum of the Princess Charlotte, at Claremont, published in Forget Me Not, 1824. Although Leopold retained ownership of Claremont until his death in 1865, he left the house in 1831 when he became the first King of the Belgians.
Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor to Claremont—both as a child and later as an adult—when Leopold, her doting uncle, lent her the house. She, in turn, lent the house to the exiled French King and Queen, Louis-Philippe I and Maria Amalia (the parents-in-law of Leopold I of Belgium), after the Revolutions of 1848. The exiled King died at Claremont in 1850.

In 1857, Offenbach and his Bouffes company performed three of his opéras bouffes there for Marie Amelie and her sons during an eight-week tour of England.

In 1870, Queen Victoria commissioned Francis John Williamson to sculpt a marble memorial to Charlotte and Leopold which was erected inside the house. (The memorial was subsequently moved to St George&#x27;s Church, Esher.)

Victoria bought Claremont for her fourth, and youngest, son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, when he married Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1882. The Duke and Duchess of Albany had two children—Alice and Charles. Charles, who had been born at Claremont in 1884, inherited the title and position of Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha upon the death of his uncle, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1900. He moved to the duchy in Germany to takethe throne, becoming a German citizen, and renouncing his claim in the British succession.

Claremont should have passed to Charles upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1922, but because he served as a German general in the First World War, the British government disallowed the inheritance. Claremont was accordingly confiscated and sold by the Public Trustee to shipping magnate Sir William Corry, director of the Cunard Line. Two years after Sir William&#x27;s death, in 1926, it was bought by Eugen Spier, a wealthy German financier.

In 1930, Claremont stood empty and was marked for demolition when it was bought, together with the Belvedere, the stables, and of parkland, by the Governors of a south London school, later renamed Claremont School and, since 1978, has been known as Claremont Fan Court School.

==The National Trust==

The National Trust acquired of the Claremont estate in 1949. In 1975, with a grant from the Slater Foundation, it set about restoring the eighteenth-century landscape garden. The Claremont Landscape Garden now displays the successive contributions of the great landscape gardeners who worked on it: Sir John Vanbrugh, Charles Bridgeman, William Kent, and Capability Brown.

<text>Jeremy Elliott &quot;Jez&quot; San OBE (born 29 March 1966) is an English game programmer and entrepreneur who founded Argonaut Software as a teenager in the 1980s. He is best known for the 1986 Atari ST game &quot;Starglider&quot; and helping to design the Super FX chip used in &quot;Star Fox&quot; for the Super NES.

==Early career==
San received his first computer, a TRS-80, at the age of twelve in 1978 from his father, who had a career in shipping the belongings of immigrants at the time. San first became interested in video game development at a young age after playing a multi-user dungeon (MUD) in the 1970s. Within a year he taught himself assembly language for several microprocessors.

San founded Argonaut Software as a teenager in high school at JFS as a way to get software consulting jobs with large companies. He worked on security systems with British Telecom and Acorn. In 1984, he started developing his first game, &quot;Skyline Attack&quot; for the Commodore 64, and also co-wrote a book, &quot;Quantum Theory&quot;, about the Sinclair QL. He became a wizard (admin) at Essex MUD, the world&#x27;s first multiplayer online role-playing game.

San&#x27;s late-1986 game &quot;Starglider&quot; for the Atari ST and Amiga sold hundreds of thousands of copies (earning him £2 per copy in royalties). The money helped launch Argonaut as a larger company that started hiring other people in 1986.

==Argonaut growth and decline==

In the late 1980s, Argonaut signed a deal with Nintendo. San attracted Nintendo&#x27;s attention because Argonaut was the first developer to successfully design 3D modelling on the NES and the Game Boy. &quot;X&quot; was published by Nintendo as the first 3D Game Boy game. San helped develop the first 3D graphics accelerator known as the Super FX chip that made &quot;Star Fox&quot; (released as &quot;Starwing&quot; in Europe) possible on the Super NES.

In 1996, Argonaut received external funding from Apax Partners and was listed publicly on the London Stock Exchange in 2000. San&#x27;s stake was reduced from 90% in 1996 to almost 50% post Argonaut Games&#x27; initial public offering (IPO) in March 2000. San also helped found ARC International when it was spun out from Argonaut in 1998 and was its largest shareholder on IPO. San made substantial share sales during the flotation by Goldman Sachs and Warburg and in 2007 fully exited ARC. Between 1999 and 2002, San funded Codeplay and is currently the majority shareholder.

San received an OBE in 2002, the first explicitly awarded for services to the video game industry.

After announcing a substantial loss in August 2004, Argonaut Group PLC suspended trading of its shares in October and appointed administrators for Argonaut Software Ltd, Morpheme Ltd and Just Add Monsters Ltd—the wholly owned subsidiaries of the PLC. The administrators sold Morpheme and Just Add Monsters back to Jez San and the other founders as ongoing businesses, while Argonaut Software Ltd was eventually liquidated.

==Post-Argonaut==
In November 2004, Just Add Monsters became Ninja Theory and continued the development of PlayStation 3 first-party game &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot;, which debuted three years later in September 2007. Also in 2004, Morpheme became Morpheme Wireless Ltd for a while before San left, and it was eventually acquired by Eidos/SCi before being shut down in 2009.

After taking a hiatus from the video game industry in 2004, San founded Crunchy Frog Ltd, which in 2005 became online poker company PKR. San served as president, having hired his replacement with CEO Malcolm Graham, formerly of the Ritz Casino and AntFactory. PKR was a 3D online poker site that operated in legal territories in Europe, Asia, and Canada but did not operate in the US, where online gambling was a grey area. In May 2017, PKR went into administration. San was only an investor at the time of its collapse and expressed sorrow at seeing his creation fold.

In 2008, San co-founded mobile application developer and publisher Origin8 with game industry colleague Foo Katan. The company produces iPhone and BlackBerry software, and has offices in London.

San is a life member of BAFTA, and was an advisory board member of the GDC and TIGA for several years.

<text>Aznar Galíndez I (also &quot;Asnar Galí&quot;) (died 839) was a Basque Count of Aragon and Conflent from 809 and Cerdanya and Urgell from 820. Aznar has been confused with Aznar Sánchez, Duke of Gascony, and some authorities have even considered the two like-named contemporaries to be one and the same person.

Aznar succeeded Aureolus as count of the valley of the River Aragón on the latter&#x27;s death in 809. Some sources indicate him as count of Jaca, which was probably the seat of his authority within the valley. He was installed by king Louis the Pious (a son of emperor Charlemagne), and remained a Frankish vassal. In 820, he was overthrown by his son-in-law García the Bad, supported by Íñigo Arista&#x27;s Navarrese forces.

He took refuge in the Vasconia that remained suzerain to the Franks, and was appointed count in Urgell and Cerdanya.

He had four children:
*Matrona, who married García the Bad, but was repudiated when he overthrew her father
*Eilona, named as daughter of count Aznar Galíndez in an 862 charter of her nephew, Guntislo
*Centullo, murdered by his brother-in-law García the Bad
*Galindo Aznárez I, later Count of Aragon

<text>Galindo Aznárez I (died 867) was Count of Aragón from 844 to 867. 
== Biography ==
Galindo was the son of Aznar Galíndez I (and his wife, a woman of unknown name), who had been Count of Aragón from 809 to 820, when a practical joke played by Galindo on his brother-in-law García Galíndez led the latter to enlist the support of the Kingdom of Pamplona in usurping the county. 

Aznar was compensated by Louis the Pious, King of West Francia, with the counties of Urgell, Cerdanya, and Conflent. Galindo received these counties from his father sometime before 833, in which year he usurped the counties of Pallars and Ribagorza. For this action he was dispossessed of Urgell and Cerdagne by Louis in 834, and was subsequently ejected from Pallars and Ribagorza by the Counts of Toulouse. Upon the heirless death in 844 of count Galindo Garcés, son of his father&#x27;s rival, Galindo was allowed to assume the countship of Aragón in exchange for recognition of the suzerainty of Pamplona over the formerly-French county.

== Personal life ==
Galindo Aznárez and an unknown woman had a son, Aznar Galíndez II, his successor. He appears to have had at least one additional child: an 867 charter mentions a son-in-law, &quot;king Sancho&quot;, whom several scholars have identified with the younger son of García Íñiguez of Pamplona, Sancho Garcés, father of Aznar Sánchez of Larraun and grandfather of queen Toda of Pamplona.

Count Galindo donated money to the Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa.

<doc id="1105227" wikidata="Q585060" url="?curid=1105227" title="Palace of the Soviets">
<text>The Palace of the Soviets () was a project to construct a political convention center in Moscow on the site of the demolished Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. The main function of the palace was to house sessions of the Supreme Soviet in its wide and tall grand hall seating over 20,000 people. If built, the tall palace would have become the world&#x27;s tallest structure, with an internal volume surpassing the combined volumes of the six tallest American skyscrapers. This was especially important to the Soviet state for propaganda purposes.

Boris Iofan&#x27;s victory in a series of four architectural competitions held between 1931 and 1933 signaled a sharp turn in Soviet architecture, from radical modernism to the monumental historicism that would come to characterize Stalinist architecture. The definitive design by Iofan, Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Helfreich was conceived in 1933–1934 and took its final shape in 1937. The staggered stack of ribbed cylinders crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin blended Art Deco and Neoclassical influences with contemporary American skyscraper technology. 

Work on the site commenced in 1933; the foundation was completed in January 1939. The German invasion in June 1941 ended the project. Engineers and workers were diverted to defense projects or pressed into the army; the installed structural steel was disassembled in 1942 for fortifications and bridges. After World War II, Joseph Stalin lost interest in the palace. Iofan produced several revised, scaled-down designs but failed to reanimate the project. The alternative Palace of the Soviets in Sparrow Hills, which was proposed after Stalin&#x27;s death, did not proceed beyond the architectural competition stage.

== The beginning (1922–31) ==

On 30 December 1922 the First All-Union Congress of Soviets announced the creation of the Soviet Union. On the same day Sergei Kirov proposed construction of a new national convention center, which was duly approved by the congress. This, according to the official Soviet narrative, was the beginning of the story of the Palace of the Soviets. Before the congress, in January–May 1919, Petrograd had held an architectural competition for the &quot;Palace of Labor&quot;; in October 1922 the launched a competition for a different &quot;Palace of Labor&quot;, endorsed by the same Sergei Kirov. Both projects were large enough to seat any conceivable convention, and none of them could materialize in a country devastated by wars and revolutions.

In post-revolution Russian language the word &quot;palace&quot; () denoted a multi-role public building that shared entertainment and administrative functions; as time went by, the administrative side predominated. The word was never applied to residences of political leaders: their private affairs remained a closely guarded secret. During the 1920s, modest &quot;palaces of labor&quot; or &quot;palaces of culture&quot; were actually built. The coveted national palace had to be exceptionally large, impressive and technologically advanced to stand above the crowd. The idea of placing a giant statue of Lenin on top of the national administrative center (originally, the Comintern building) goes back to a 1924 proposal by Viktor Balikhin, then a graduate student at Vkhutemas: &quot;Arc lamps will flood the villages, towns, parks and squares, calling everyone to honor Lenin even at night ...&quot;. The proposal was later popularized by Balikhin&#x27;s rationalist movement, the ASNOVA, but gained little recognition.

The decision to build the &quot;House of Congresses&quot; () was made at the end of 1930 or in early 1931, and announced in February 1931. The influences behind the decision cannot be reliably ascertained. claims Stalin was the project&#x27;s sole initiator; Sergey Kuznetsov counters that the idea was pitched by Alexei Rykov. The &quot;House of Congresses&quot; was, chronologically, the first of the three megaprojects launched in Moscow in 1931, months before the Moscow Canal and the Moscow Metro. Its initial scope was modest; the architects and the politicians believed that building could be topped out in 1933. However, the unchecked ambitions of both groups soon caused a multifold increase in size, scope and cost. In the summer of 1931, the already bloated project was renamed the &quot;Palace of the Soviets&quot;.

=== The architect ===

In February 1931, the government set up a three-tier project management structure. The Construction Council was a decorative political committee chaired by Kliment Voroshilov and later Vyacheslav Molotov; it served as a proxy for announcing decisions made by Stalin and the Politburo. The subordinate Construction Directorate (USDS) was the actual project management team of (chair), Boris Iofan (chief architect), Hermann Krasin, and Ivan Mashkov. The USDS appointed and supervised the Technical Council, that included dozens of experienced architects, artists and engineers.

Boris Iofan, the second in command in the USDS, immediately assumed the title and role of chief architect. A recent repatriant from Italy and a long-time student of Italian architect Armando Brasini, Iofan was a maverick within the Soviet architectural community and had no obligations to any group. He was also a trusted insider of the party elite, with particularly strong ties to Alexei Rykov and Avel Yenukidze. His career with Soviet state clients began in 1922 in Rome and proceeded through the 1920s at an unprecedented and so far unexplained pace. By 1931 he had a proven record of completing high-profile projects, including the enormous House on the Embankment with its —the largest modern auditorium in Moscow. Stalin certainly endorsed Iofan&#x27;s appointment, probably on Yenukidze&#x27;s recommendation.

Iofan was difficult to work with soon forcing Kryukov to resign. In the autumn of 1931 the chair of the USDS passed to party apparatchik , the architect&#x27;s former superior at the House on the Embankment project. Kryukov, Mikhailov, Rykov, Yenukidze and Iofan&#x27;s colleagues at the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee would be killed in Stalin&#x27;s purges, but the unsinkable architect would survive unharmed and retain his office, despite the incriminating connections.

Iofan prepared the terms of architectural competitions and controlled all the USDS&#x27;s paperwork, giving him an advantage over any potential competitor. This obvious conflict of interest provoked speculation that the competitions were rigged in Iofan&#x27;s favor, or that he was the chosen architect from the very start and the competitions were merely a ruse. In the 2010s archival research confirmed this hypothesis, which was afterwards supported by Iofan&#x27;s biographers Maria Kostyuk, Dmitrij Chmelnizki and Sergey Kuznetsov. As early as 6 February 1931, Iofan devised a three-step, nine-month consultation schedule with a predetermined outcome. The plan was soon implemented in a series of architectural competitions, where Iofan acted as &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (first among equals) in public and the &quot;éminence grise&quot; (powerful decision maker) behind the scenes. According to Kuznetsov, Iofan initiated and managed the competitions for his own benefit, to harvest free ideas from his unsuspecting colleagues. He never agreed to be a temporary placeholder and did not intend to give up his lead to anyone.

=== Choice of a site ===
In March 1931, the Construction Council chose a compact site in the former Okhotny Ryad Street market, just a few hundred meters (yards) north-west from the Kremlin and Red Square. There were no large or otherwise valuable buildings to raze; demolition of existing low-rise buildings and the relocation of their inhabitants required little time or effort. 
Left-wing architectural factions immediately disputed this economically sound choice. In April–May the Technical Council reviewed various alternatives and confirmed the selection of the Okhotny Ryad site.

Molotov and Voroshilov thought differently. On 25 May, the Politburo, advised by Molotov and Voroshilov, voted in favor of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour site. Hannes Meyer and the ASNOVA supported this option. Iofan had secretly studied all the alternatives beforehand and was quite comfortable with the cathedral site. It required extensive demolition and presented so far unknown technical challenges, but it was the largest site and it formed a tight visual ensemble with Iofan&#x27;s House on the Embankment. Most of the Technical Council disagreed. On 30 May, they recommended the sites in Zaryadye or Bolotnaya Square as second-best alternatives; the cathedral site was ranked least acceptable. Tired of insubordination, Voroshilov invited the stubborn professionals to a meeting with Stalin. On 2 June 1931, Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Meyer and eight selected architects from the Technical Council convened in the Kremlin, where Stalin presented his arguments in favor of the cathedral site. Kaganovich feared the destruction of an Orthodox shrine would spark an antisemitic backlash and suggested a site in Sparrow Hills, but Stalin&#x27;s viewpoint prevailed.

Historians disagree over the interpretation of this meeting. According to Kuznetsov, the decision had not yet been finalized, and the architects could still propose other sites. According to Sona Hoisington, the decision was final, but its main objective was not the palace but the destruction of the cathedral, with the project being a purely political statement, made without prior feasibility studies and completely disregarding the economics. According to Chmelnizki, the decision was final; it was the first step in the development of Stalinist architecture. On 5 June 1931, the outcome was sealed by the Politburo. In December the stripped hulk of the cathedral was publicly blown up. The Okhotny Ryad site was also demolished for the construction of the (1932–1935) and Arkady Mordvinov&#x27;s residential block on Tverskaya Street (1937–1939).

The idea of destroying cultural heritage was not a novelty to the Soviet regime, as in the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Soviet Union fell from 29,584 to less than 500 (1.7%) as a result of demolitions or conversions into secular buildings.

== The four competitions (1931–1933) ==
=== Preliminary round (February–July 1931) ===
In April 1931, the chosen architects and architectural groups received terms of the first, preliminary competition. The brief, prepared by Iofan and signed by Kryukov, reiterated the &quot;monumentality&quot; and emphasizing the &quot;uniqueness&quot; of the future palace: it should be radically different from any existing public building. It sent a clear message that the entries would be judged not by professionals but by politicians, who do not and would not align with any existing professional faction.

By the end of June, the USDS had collected 15 entries representing all active movements, as well as Iofan and his brother Dmitry. Most, including the Iofans, leaned toward modernist architecture. Iofan had considered various alternatives, and ruled out compact centric floor plans in favor of a sprawling group of buildings aligned along the north–south axis of the cathedral site. The two halls were placed at the ends of the axis, with spacious inner courtyards and a lean, tall tower in between. The draft did not impress contemporary observers. The USDS did not name a clear winner but cautiously praised an entry by Heinrich Ludwig, an enormous pentagonal enlargement of Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum devoid of any stylistic cues.

=== International competition (July 1931 – February 1932) ===

On 18 July 1931, the USDS announced a public, open, international competition, with entries due by 20 October (later extended to 1 December 1931). In September, the USDS amended the terms and explained the design of the palace would not be awarded to a single architect or a group or firm. The USS claimed no single group could overcome the project&#x27;s unprecedented challenges; it requires a joint effort of &quot;all living creative forces of the Soviet society&quot;. The message foreshadowed the imminent nationalization of the formerly independent professional community, but no one, even the party insiders like Iofan, Alabyan or Shchusev, could predict the outcome. Another covert purpose of the competition—suppression of undesirable architecture in a manner similar to the &quot;Degenerate art&quot; campaign in Germany—would be revealed by Alexey Tolstoy (another party insider) later, just before the announcement of the winners. Tolstoy clearly warned the architects that Gothic architecture, &quot;American skyscraperism&quot; and &quot;corbusianism&quot; had become distinctly unwanted.

The expert jury chaired by Molotov received 112 brief proposals and 160 proper drafts, including 24 by foreign architects. Dignitaries like Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius or Erich Mendelsohn were preselected and invited by Iofan for a fixed fee. Armando Brasini agreed to submit a proposal at no cost. From a professional standpoint the best proposal came from Le Corbusier. The Soviet press praised his innovative, logical and convenient floor plan as late as 1940, but the jury felt the high-rise exoskeleton supporting the saddle roof was inappropriate for downtown Moscow.

Most of the sixteen drafts selected by the jury were modernist in inspiration, but the choice of the top three winners surprised and embarrassed everyone involved. The Politburo made the decision secretly, and the Construction Council announced it publicly five days later on 28 February 1931. The three prizes were awarded to Boris Iofan, Ivan Zholtovsky and the virtually unknown British-American autodidact Hector Hamilton. Iofan presented a revised version of his earlier proposal, re-aligned along the Moskva River. The draft disposed with former Constructivist novelty The shape of the main hall changed from a parabolic dome to a stack of flat cylinders and, according to Katherine Zubovich, acquired &quot;more italianate form&quot;. Le Corbusier despised it as &quot;childish megalomania&quot;. 
Ivan Zholtovsky bizarrely combined Italian Renaissance with the Pharos lighthouse and the Colosseum. Hamilton&#x27;s Art Deco draft was uninspiring but the most cohesive of the three. Hamilton, who had never been to Moscow, deliberately avoided any references to both modernist and historical styles. The symmetrical array of staggered rectangular shapes and semicylinders, facing the river, was adorned only with uniform rows of white vertical pylons. The &quot;ribbed style&quot; of Hamilton&#x27;s drafts is strangely reminiscent of almost all Soviet public buildings of the Brezhnev era. It was certainly not unique to Hamilton&#x27;s entry: similar ribbed facades, a staple of American Art Deco, were also used by Alexey Dushkin, Iosif Langbard, Dmitry Chechulin and Iofan himself.

European left-wing architects could not accept the fact and appealed directly to Stalin. The leaders of the Congrès Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne (CIAM) realized very well that the competition was a matter of politics, rather than art, and that Stalin had the final say. They were willing to cooperate with the dictator and felt betrayed when it turned out he had his own plans. Their message amounted to an ultimatum, threatening to retract all support to the Soviet Union. It is not known if Stalin ever read these letters, but the withdrawal of unwanted &quot;allies&quot; certainly suited him well.

=== Third and fourth rounds (March 1932 – February 1933)===
The third, closed, competition among 12 invited teams of architects was held in March–July 1932. In addition to the nine prize-winners of the open competition, at Mikhailov&#x27;s request the USDS also invited notable constructivists and rationalists. Two future co-authors of the palace, Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Helfreich were invited as a reward for their work on the Lenin Library. The USDS required all architects to abandon a sprawling, squat design in favor of a single tall, compact, and monumental structure, avoiding any resemblance to church architecture. The main hall, seating 15,000 people, had to face the Kremlin.

The Ginzburg and Ladovsky teams remained true to modernist ideas. Karo Alabyan and company produced an impressive and novel modernist design—&quot;a ship of state&quot; with three lean &quot;funnels&quot; flanking the river. The other architects followed the instructions and presented compact, monumental but uninspiring proposals. Iofan settled for a tall stack of four cylinders, wrapped in rows of white &quot;ribbed style&quot; pylons. The jury declined to appoint a winner and announced yet another round of competition. Stalin, on the contrary, privately notified Kaganovich, Molotov and Voroshilov that &quot;Iofan&#x27;s plan is unconditionally the best...&quot; and compiled a list of necessary changes. Stalin expressly ruled out the alternative designs by Zholtovsky (&quot;...smacks of Noah&#x27;s ark&quot;), and particularly by Shchusev (&quot;the same cathedral, but without a cross. Possibly, Shchusev hopes to add a cross at a later day&quot;).

The fourth and final competition between five selected teams was held in August 1932 – February 1933. This time, all proposals were very similar in composition, although still different stylistically. On 10 May 1933 the Politburo announced the final decision in favor of Iofan. The winning design closely followed Iofan&#x27;s earlier proposal — a compact, ziggurat-like stack of three cylinders perched on a massive stylobate and flanked with colonnades, ramps and grand staircases. Total height of the core structure reached 220 meters (720&#x27;), but there was no office tower and no statue of Lenin yet. The proposed statue of the &quot;freed proletarian&quot; was merely 18 meter (60&#x27;) tall. Structural engineering issues had not been addressed at all. The Politburo was not completely impressed with the result, and instructed Iofan to install a giant statue of Lenin, 50 to 75 meter (160 to 250&#x27;) tall, on top of the palace. The official narrative published in 1940 presented this proposal as Stalin&#x27;s personal initiative. Molotov hesitated, arguing that the face of Lenin would not be seen from the main plaza, but had to bow to Stalin and Voroshilov.

According to Andrey Barkhin, the true purpose of the fourth stage was to narrow down stylistic choice to one of two alternatives: either following an existing, historical model, or creating something completely new. Iofan managed to suit both sides: although his proposal looked novel, it was in fact a blend of various identifiable prototypes. Iofan himself said the two main inspirations behind his design were the Pergamon Altar and the Victor Emmanuel II Monument which was, in turn, inspired by the Pergamon Altar. The choice was natural for Iofan, because he had often seen the Vittoriano while living in Rome, and because he studied under one of its creators, Manfredo Manfredi. The other identifiable and undisputed design cue is the Art Deco &quot;ribbed style&quot; of exterior walls, which had already been used by other Soviet architects. The dome of the grand hall was inspired by the Centennial Hall in Breslau. Less obvious, speculative sources range from Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; to Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s &quot;Turris Babel&quot;.

=== Influences and interpretations ===
During the competition period, the state dissolved formerly independent architectural movements and &quot;de facto&quot; nationalized all architects under the umbrella of state-owned design companies and the . By the end of 1932, modernist architecture in general, and its constructivist, and formalist movements in particular, came to a halt, giving way to the emerging Stalinist architecture. Modernist projects laid down earlier were gradually completed and often &quot;improved&quot; to suit the new policy. Architects kept on producing and publishing modernist drafts until at least 1935, but such proposals had no chance to be built. Rudolf Wolters, who came to Novosibirsk in the summer of 1932, reported that by the time of his arrival the provincial party executives had already received orders from Moscow to build &quot;in classical style&quot; only. On the national level, no such orders were formally published; the change appeared to be a natural development within the professional community.

The overwhelming majority of Soviet, Russian and foreign authors, with the notable exception of Antonia Cunliffe, agree the competitions represented a deliberate rejection of modernism in favor of monumental historicism. The connection has always been public but subject to different interpretations. Soviet authors of the 1930s usually appealed to the &quot;improved welfare of the masses&quot;. Constructivism was presented as a temporary, low-cost ersatz architecture. Once the nation had overcome the bitter poverty of the 1920s, &quot;the people&quot; (i.e. the communist state) disposed with stopgap solutions and rightfully embraced &quot;quality&quot; architecture. After World War II the &quot;welfare of the masses&quot; fell to an all-time low and Soviet critics adjusted accordingly. They painted modernism as a hostile, subversive influence of the capitalist West that was promptly revealed and suppressed by the party. The reform was effected through the party decrees of the 1930s, starting with the USDS review of the international competition.

In the late 1950s and 1960s modernism became the official style of the Soviet state, and recent history was rewritten again to exonerate the party. Soviet theorists argued that the architects of the 1930s abandoned constructivism voluntarily and then forged the new monumental style on their own. The &quot;excesses&quot; of Stalinist architecture were the architects&#x27; fault only. The party, which carefully advised the professionals, bears no responsibility for what was actually built. A toned-down version of the same narrative persisted until the 2000s, notably in the works of . Western authors, likewise, did not produce a plausible explanation until the 2000s publications by and Christiane Post.

In the late 1990s Dmitry Chmelnizki advanced a different explanation. The competitions were set up by Stalin personally as a complex political provocation. In the opening, self-educational phase, Stalin familiarized himself with all active architectural schools and selected the general direction that would soon become the official style. Then, he artfully degraded the social status and self-esteem of the architectural profession—which was a prerequisite to nationalization. Finally, he destroyed the ties that united the architects into firms, groups and movements. In the end, the former diverse and independent professional community was reduced to a homogenous mass of obedient individuals. Anna Selivanova later published a similar theory.

Opponents like Sergey Kuznetsov argue the existing evidence of Stalin&#x27;s personal involvement is too scarce to make far-reaching conclusions. There are very few transcripts and quotations reproduced in the Soviet media. The protocols of the Politburo and the journals of Stalin&#x27;s office in the Kremlin contain very few records related to the palace. Chmelnizki, on the contrary, rates the same Politburo evidence as substantial. Kuznetsov says mundane issues like deliveries of firewood mattered more than architectural follies. Apart from a few publicized meetings, there is no evidence that Stalin ever invited architects to the Kremlin. The only architect who had spoken to Stalin regularly was his personal contractor Miron Merzhanov, who remained modernist throughout the 1930s.

Yet another hypothesis suggested by Sona Hoisington in 2003 views the stylistic change as a direct and unintended consequence of the destruction of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Demolition of the largest building in Moscow left a void in the city fabric that required, at the very least, an equally monumental replacement. The modernist drafts received in 1931 could not make up for the loss. They lacked &quot;a center of gravity, a sense of hierarchy&quot;, and any connection to the existing city; there was nothing distinctly &quot;Soviet&quot;, either. The state demanded &quot;supermonumentality&quot;, and found it in Iofan&#x27;s Art Deco proposal, which was then replicated in lesser projects across the country.

== The definitive design (1934–1939) ==

=== Forced collaboration ===

The decree of 10 May 1933 expressly warned Iofan that the politicians felt free to &quot;help&quot; him by attaching other architects to the design process. The threat materialized on 4 June, when the Politburo co-opted Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Helfreich. Iofan remained the chief architect, but he now had to deal with two experienced and influential co-authors. The theatrical, dramatic visionary architecture that emerged from this collaboration was approved and publicized to great pomp in February 1934 despite a complete lack of technical and economic estimates.

The official narrative presented the outcome as a joint effort of the three peers, but the reality was more complicated. In the second half of 1933, Iofan&#x27;s team in Moscow and the Shchuko-Helfreich team in Leningrad operated separately. Iofan did not want to alter his 1933 design radically or to increase its already substantial height. Contrary to the instructions received in May, he preferred placing the statue of Lenin on a standalone pedestal or tower, to maintain the balance between the statue and the building. Shchuko and Helfreich thought otherwise, and did not hesitate to perch the giant statue on top of the building, extending its height by . Initially, their base structure was a slab-sided rectangular block rather than Iofan&#x27;s stack of cylinders. Iofan objected, but Shchuko appealed directly to the Construction Council. The politicians summoned Iofan and forced him to accept the Shchuko-Helfreich proposal or be removed from the project. He complied, and the design evolved along the middle road between the two extremes.

Placement of a giant statue on top of an already enormous structure caused a disproportional, nonlinear increase in building height. To make the statue visible from the ground, architects had to mount it on a tall but narrow, tapering pedestal—a &quot;skyscraper&quot; standing on the top of the grand hall. The increased height of the pedestal made the statue appear smaller, and the cycle repeated itself. According to the official narrative, experiments with scale models led to the conclusion that the appropriate height of the statue is exactly . Lenin&#x27;s head alone had to be almost as large as the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions. The location of the statue and the design by Sergey Merkurov remained controversial throughout the 1930s and were harshly criticized in public by Boris Korolyov, Nikolai Tomsky, Martiros Saryan and other involved artists.

=== American experience ===

A salient function of the palace project was the transfer of modern technology to the backward Soviet industry. At the end of 1934, Iofan, Shchuko, Helfreikh and their associates departed on a lengthy tour of European and American cities. Their main objectives were the reevaluation of the 1934 design against best American practices, and the research and purchase of modern construction technologies. Moran &amp; Proctor, a leading foundation engineering firm, became the first American company to be hired for the project and would assist the USDS throughout the 1930s. More visits and more contracts, facilitated through the Amtorg network, would follow in subsequent years. From a purely architectural perspective, the most important experience was gained at the site of the partially completed Rockefeller Center. Iofan used the stepped-slab motive of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in later projects, and directly inspired careful realignment of the palace&#x27;s staggered layers. These and other subtle exterior changes proceeded throughout the rest of the decade, along with the subsidiary interior design and urban planning tasks, and the creation of factories and workshops.

The definitive exterior design took its final shape by 1937. The number of stacked cylinders was reduced from five to four with progressively decreasing, rather than uniform, spacings between the pylons. The stainless steel moldings attached to the pylons widened progressively with height for a smooth transition from the granite-clad tower to the all-metal statue. The pose and the proportions of the statue also changed. This revised design was presented and discussed at a conference of the Union of Soviet architects in July 1939. A book by describing the design and the construction process in plain language was published one year later.

=== Size ===
The total height of the palace, including the statue, was set at , taller than the recently completed Empire State Building. Being a much wider structure, the palace was estimated to weigh over 1.5 million tons, and have a gross volume of over 7.5 million cubic meters (9.8 million cu. yd.). Its net internal volume would have surpassed the combined volume of six largest American skyscrapers of the period. The palace would require 350.000 tons of structural steel, six times more than the Empire State Building and almost twice as much as the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge).

The grand hall seating 21 thousand people had to have an inner diameter of , an outer diameter of , a height of meters and internal volume of 970,000 cubic meters (1.3 million cu. yd.). The &quot;small&quot; hall had 5,000 seats and a height of . The &quot;even smaller&quot; Constitution Hall and Reception Hall in the stylobate measured and . Floors in the office tower were planned to have a usable height of , for even more session halls of various government branches. The exact number of floors was not disclosed.

Enormous as it was, the palace&#x27;s grand hall was much smaller than Albert Speer&#x27;s Volkshalle, designed to hold 180 thousand people, but the Russian palace surpassed the Volkshalle in total height.

=== Structure ===

The completed palace would have consisted of two parts resting on two independent foundations: the circular core with the grand hall, the office tower and the statue of Lenin; and a rectangular stylobate adjacent to the core. The core&#x27;s concrete foundations rested on limestone bedrock below the level of the Moskva River. The much lighter, tall stylobate could safely rest on the uppermost limestone sill, below the ground.

The stylobate design used a traditional steel frame; on the contrary, the frame of the core was radically unconventional. Instead of running the whole vertical height of the building, the palace&#x27;s load-bearing columns had to wrap around the grand hall. Thus, the frame was split into three distinct segments. The lower segment, tall, comprised 32 pairs of vertical columns placed around the grand hall and connected to the foundation slab via massive riveted &quot;shoes&quot;. These &quot;shoes&quot; rested on massive steel plates implanted into the concrete slab. Columns of the second segment were placed at a 22° angle, forming a tent over the grand hall up to the mark. Above it, a traditional vertical frame would be used. Two massive steel rings, similar to the hoops that hold the staves of a barrel together would hold the tent. These rings, weighing an estimated 28 thousand tons, were the largest, the heaviest and the most expensive elements of the frame. The statue of Lenin, weighing around 6,000 tons, was to be built around its own steel frame, and clad in monel sheeting with an estimated lifetime of two thousand years.

External walls followed the American pattern of hollow-body brick infill and granite exterior cladding. According to the official narrative, Stalin instructed the designers to avoid unnecessary visual clutter and use a simple two-tone color scheme. The designers selected greyish blue Ukrainian labradorite for the basement and pale grey granite from the valley for the rest of the structure.

=== Engineering systems ===

The palace&#x27;s internal transport infrastructure was designed assuming 50,000 visitors daily. The routes to the grand hall and to the office tower were physically separated; the former relied primarily on stairs and escalators, the latter on elevators. There were to be 130 passenger elevators carrying 25 people each, 27 service elevators and 20 elevators with firefighting equipment. Since no elevator could travel the whole height of the building, visitors to the top floors had to make two or three transfers, sometimes via escalators or stairs.

Electrical consumption of the palace was specified at 90 MW peak, and 90 million kWh per annum. Fault-tolerant, redundant electricity supply required the construction of three new thermal power stations.

Internal cleaning and waste disposal systems contained twelve central vacuum cleaning stations of 750 kW each, and thirty industrial garbage disposal units with a combined capacity of seven tons/day. Heavy air conditioning equipment would have been located below ground level, the conditioned air would be delivered to each seat in the grand hall via a network of ducts running under each row of seats. The placement of air intakes required further research on the distribution of pollutants in the air; the designers knew that the intakes should have been raised to at least , but the exact height was not yet known. Apparently dust prevention and cleaning the dust were paramount concerns. The designers even provided for vibrating brushes, installed in the floors of the lobbies, for cleaning the soles of the visitors&#x27; shoes.

=== Urban redevelopment ===

Moscow&#x27;s planners viewed the palace as the hub of the &quot;Ilyich Alley&quot;, a new southwest-to-northeast axis aligned along present-day Komsomolsky Prospect, Volkhonka Street, Manezhnaya Square and Sakharov Prospect. The concept developed by the Vesnin brothers and Ivan Leonidov in the 1920s was incorporated in the in its basic form, and was subsequently reexamined in numerous drafts and proposals. Real construction practice often contradicted the plans: new buildings erected in the center of Moscow often blocked or narrowed the planned avenue.

In 1940, the city approved a revised plan. All buildings between the palace and the Kremlin, including the Moscow Manege, had to be demolished. The Alexander Garden would be leveled into a flat and straight boulevard. The Pushkin Museum building, which partly obstructed the course of the Alley, would be moved north to Gogolevsky Boulevard. Most of it would be absorbed into the palace plaza. The plaza would extend far south-west along the axis of the Alley, and north-west into present-day Arbat District. The Zamoskvorechye island west of the House on the Embankment would disappear, making way for a wide reflective pool. The tip of the island would become a base to the memorial of the &quot;Chelyuskin&quot; and the projected Pantheon of the Aviators.

After World War II, the Ivan Zholtovsky workshop proposed an even larger, and certainly unreal, redevelopment plan for the central squares. Nothing ever came from these fantasies except for the construction of the New Arbat Avenue in the 1960s.

== Construction and demolition (1933–1942) ==

A geological survey of the site began in 1933 and continued into 1934. Drilling to depths of confirmed the feasibility of construction. The uppermost limestone sill was too thin to carry the main building&#x27;s weight, but the second one, below the water level, was sufficiently solid. Groundwater in the area contained very little sulfates and chlorides, and was almost always still, thus concrete degradation was not a significant concern.

In the second half of 1934, the builders drilled hundreds of boreholes around the perimeter of the site and pumped hot bitumen into the ground. This formed a watertight vertical curtain extending from the surface to the load-bearing sill, which allowed safe excavation below the river level. Blasting and excavation commenced in January 1935, and continued for more than three years. To clear the pit down to the bedrock, the workers removed of rock and of soft soil. The core&#x27;s concrete foundations, consisting of two concentric rings with an external diameter of , were completed in January 1938. In a related but independent development, the nearby &quot;Dvorets Sovetov&quot; (&quot;Palace of the Soviets&quot;) metro station, placed just outside the watertight perimeter, was built in less than a year in 1934–1935.

Two types of structural corrosion-resistant alloy steel were developed specifically for the palace: the high-strength DS (ДС) containing copper and chromium, and the regular-strength 3M. The steel beams were rolled, cut and milled at the Verkhnyaya Salda plant, and transported by rail on custom-made flatcars to a transshipment yard in Luzhniki. After inspection and assembly, land tractors and barges hauled the steel to the construction site.

In 1939, when the palace&#x27;s frame rose above ground level, the propaganda campaign around it reached its peak. The outline of the palace was so omnipresent in Soviet media that, according to Sheila Fitzpatrick, it became more familiar to the average citizen than any existing building. The palace appeared on postcards, stationery and candy wrappers. Filmmakers routinely used special effects to blend the model of the palace into live-action street scenes, as if the structure actually existed.

In the summer of 1940, when the lower load-bearing columns were partially installed, the time to complete the whole frame was estimated at 30 months. A newspaper photograph dated 26 June 1941 attests that by then the frame of the northern wing was largely complete. According to Iofan&#x27;s biographer Maria Kostyuk, the palace would have certainly been built had it not been for the German invasion.

Immediately after the outbreak of the war, construction was suspended indefinitely; many of its 3,600 construction workers were pressed into military service. The USDS factories and workshops were mobilized for the war effort; the stock of structural steel was used for Moscow&#x27;s anti-tank defenses. Iofan&#x27;s closest students volunteered for the army and perished in battles. In August–September 1941 project manager and his engineering staff, along with 560 railcars of the USDS equipment, were evacuated to build the . Iofan and Merkurov left Moscow in October under direct orders from Molotov.

At the end of 1941, the remaining workers duly fireproofed and camouflaged the steel frame, and left Moscow for the Urals. In 1942, the frame was disassembled to salvage steel for building railway bridges. With no workers left to maintain the watertight curtain, river water seeped through and eventually flooded the foundations. In 1958–1960 the site was drained and converted into an open-air swimming pool.

== After the demolition (1941–1956) ==
Iofan and the remnants of his team spent most of the war in Sverdlovsk working on defense projects. He would later recall that in December 1941, at the peak of the Battle of Moscow, unnamed authorities instructed him to resume work on the palace. However, there is plenty of evidence that he did not have resources to do it. Work on the palace proceeded slowly in Iofan&#x27;s free time. The next iteration of the design, the so-called &quot;Sverdlovsk variant&quot;, emerged only at the end of 1943. It was superficially similar to the 1937 design, but looked flatter, heavier and lacked the dynamics of the original. Iofan removed the ribbed pylons from the upper layers and added many oversized, opulent sculptures. The &quot;Sverdlovsk Variant&quot; was presented at the Kremlin in 1944 and in 1945, and became the new canon replacing the pre-war designs in mass media.

However, by this time, Stalin had lost interest in the palace. Instead, in January 1947, the state concentrated resources on eight lesser skyscrapers in Moscow. Early official announcements presented the new project as a constellation of towers centered around the dominant Palace of the Soviets. Very soon the new towers were given priority over any pre-war plans, and effectively replaced the Palace as the new propaganda icons. Unfinished projects launched before the war were quietly scrapped or repurposed to the needs of new tenants. By 1953, seven of eight planned towers were actually built, while the palace became a phantom, a fruitless exercise in &quot;paper architecture&quot;.

Of the three titular architects of the palace, Vladimir Shchuko died in 1939, and Vladimir Helfreich moved on to other projects, which included one of the &quot;sisters&quot;. Boris Iofan tried to secure the contract for the main building of Moscow State University, but fell out of favor. The university contract, along with all preliminary work by Iofan&#x27;s team, was awarded to Lev Rudnev. Iofan remained in charge of the unbuilt palace and was instructed to decrease the size and cost. From 1947 to 1956, he presented six new proposals. The 1947–1948 variant decreased to in height and 5.3 million cubic meters (7 million cu. yd.) in volume. The 1949 variant retained same height, with a further decrease in volume. In 1952–1953, the completion of the &quot;seven sisters&quot; freed up resources and the palace expanded to ; in 1953 it decreased again to .

On 30 November 1954, Nikita Khrushchev launched a public campaign for the mass construction of affordable housing, and against the &quot;excesses&quot; of Stalinist architecture. Khruschev had no preference for a particular style, but his speechwriters and consultants carefully guided him towards modernist views. The former elders of Stalinist architecture did not dare to object and accepted the new reality. One year later, the &quot;excesses&quot; were condemned in a joint decree of the party and the Soviets, and in 1956 the government dissolved the last refuge of Stalinist art—the Academy of Architecture. The almost forgotten Palace of the Soviets was not mentioned in any of the debates and decrees. Iofan did not want to give up yet. Aided by Helfreich and his new partner , he scaled down the design again to in 1954 and to in 1956.

== The other Palace of the Soviets (1956–1962) ==
In the autumn of 1956, Iofan&#x27;s work finally stopped after the announcement of a new competition for a new Palace of the Soviets. The volume of the new structure was capped at 500,000 cubic meters (700,000 cu. yd.), 15 times less than Iofan&#x27;s design. The main hall had to seat 4,600 people (five times less), with two lesser halls seating 1,500 people each.

The initial proposal mandated construction on the old site (of the demolished cathedral) which by 1956 was flooded and needed extensive salvage work. In December 1956, the government proposed two alternative locations for the palace, both near Rudnev&#x27;s University building. Proximity to the university tower precluded any high-rise designs; the new palace had to be a sprawling, horizontal, flat structure. However, same proximity suggested that the complete break with Stalinist art had not yet been sealed. The most important government building in Moscow had to be unique; it could not be built cheaply, and it could tolerate at least some &quot;excesses&quot;. The neoclassicists believed they were given a chance to redeem Stalinist art in the eyes of Khrushchev. The rising modernists felt Khrushchev&#x27;s tacit support and saw a chance to impose their own view on the whole Soviet industry.

The first round of the competition was split into two concurrent leagues: the open competition, with 115 entries representing both Stalinists and modernists, and a privately contracted competition with 21 entries. The winning, and probably the most artistically valuable proposal, by , was an outright modernist glass box—a huge winter garden with three oval halls floating in a sea of greenery. Contrary to expectations, Vlasov did not receive a formal prize immediately, but was rewarded later on. A similar but less radical design by disposed of the winter garden and added rows of narrow white pylons. The second round of the competition was held in 1959, and attended by Khrushchev himself. This time, all the entries followed the template established by Vlasov and Pavlov, with superficial differences. The new canon of Soviet state architecture, which first took tangible shape in the Soviet pavilion at the Expo 58, was now complete. Vlasov became the head of the new Palace of Soviets construction agency. Very little is known about its work, which ceased after Vlasov&#x27;s death in 1962. The idea behind the Palace of the Soviets was laid to rest. Its intended role was taken over by the Palace of Congresses in the Moscow Kremlin, completed in 1961. The building replaced several heritage buildings, including the old neo-classical building of the State Armoury, and some of the back corpuses of the Great Kremlin Palace. This, and that the architecture of the projected building contrasted with the historic milieu resulted in quite an uproar, particularly after other historic buildings of the Kremlin, such as the Chudov and Ascension cloisters, had already been demolished during the Stalin era, and laws that were introduced by the mid-1950s prohibited the demolition of historic structures, making the construction in some ways illegal.

<text>Brindle is a coat coloring pattern in animals, particularly dogs, cattle, guinea pigs, cats, and, rarely, horses. It is sometimes described as &quot;tiger-striped&quot;, although the brindle pattern is more subtle than that of a tiger&#x27;s coat.

Brindle typically appears as black stripes on a red base. The stripes are eumelanin (black/brown pigment) and the base is phaeomelanin (red/yellow pigment), so the appearance of those pigments can be changed by any of the genes which usually affect them. 
* Eumelanin (the pigment making up the stripes) can be affected by: merle (and harlequin), liver, dilution, greying, and recessive red. 
* Phaeomelanin (the pigment making up the base) can be affected by: Intensity locus. 
White markings and ticking can occur on any brindle dog.

Brindle is caused by a complex gene process and is technically a form of mosaicism, where some cells express one allele (KB) and other cells express a different allele (ky), a little like tortoiseshell cats. This makes it very difficult to test for, and there are currently no commercially available tests that are able to detect brindle. Brindle dogs will usually test as KBky, and carriers (one dominant black allele, one brindle) cannot be identified without breeding.

==Dogs==

The brindle pattern may also take the place of tan in tricolor coats of some dog breeds (such as Basenjis). This coloration looks very similar to tricolor, and can be distinguished only at close range. Dogs of this color are often described as &quot;trindle&quot;. It can also occur in combination with merle in the points, or as a brindle merle, in breeds such as the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, although the latter is not acceptable in the show ring. The &quot;dark&quot; markings are black or the dilutions gray (called blue) or brown (sometimes called red). It is not uncommon for a brindled Cairn Terrier to become progressively more black or silver as it ages.

== Cats ==

Brindled domestic cats are also known as tortoiseshell cats, and in some cases, tabby cats; they are almost exclusively female.

== Guinea pigs ==
Brindle is an old variety in guinea pigs. They are difficult to breed to perfection, as the black and red hairs should intermingle evenly all over. Brindle guinea pigs&#x27; fur type is Abyssinian (rosetted).

== Horses ==
Brindle coloring in horses is extremely rare and most commonly caused by pigment concentrating along Blaschko&#x27;s lines during fetal development. In two confirmed cases it has been linked to spontaneous chimerism, resulting in an animal with two sets of DNA, with the brindle pattern being an expression of two different sets of equine coat color genes in one horse. These forms are not heritable. In some horses the pattern seems to be inherited, indicating that one or more genes are responsible. One heritable brindle pattern in a family of American Quarter Horses was identified in 2016 and named Brindle1 (BR1). The Brindle1 phenotype has an X-linked, semidominant mode of inheritance. Female horses with this gene have a striped coat pattern; hairs from the stripes have a different texture as well as color, are less straight, and are more unruly. Male horses have sparse manes and tails but do not show a striped coat texture pattern. A Brindle1 test is available.

Brindle coloring consists of irregular stripes extending vertically over the horse&#x27;s body and horizontally around the legs. Brindle horses can also have a dorsal stripe when caused by dun or non-dun1. It usually does not affect the head and legs as much as the body, with the heaviest concentrations of brindling being on the neck, shoulders and hindquarters. The coloring has been documented in the past. At the Zoological Museum of the Academy of Science in Saint Petersburg, a Russian cab horse of brindle coloring from the early 19th century was mounted and put on display due to its rarity.

=== Description ===
The brindled pattern found in horses could be described as vertical stripes that are found along the neck, back, hindquarters, and upper legs. The horse&#x27;s head is usually a solid color and is not affected by the striping. The brindled pattern has no effect on dark points on horses. Some brindle-colored horses are more eye-catching than others.

With this coat pattern there is a base coat that covers the entire body of the horse. This base coat color can be any color. Recorded examples have been bay, chestnut, palomino, and dun. Earliest documented cases were said to have red dun or grulla as a base coat. Over top of the base color is either a lighter or darker color, giving the appearance of stripes.

==Other animals==

Brindle coloring exists in cattle.

The Blue Wildebeest is a species of brindled gnu.
For crested geckos, the term &quot;brindle&quot; is used to describe a morph with darker stripes of color.

==Etymology ==
The word brindled is a variant of Middle English brended (early 15c.), from bren &quot;brown color&quot; (13c.), noun from past participle of brennen &quot;burn&quot; (from Proto-Germanic *brennan &quot;to burn&quot;, from PIE root *gwher- &quot;to heat, warm&quot;). The etymological sense of the adjective appears to be &quot;marked as though by branding or burning&quot;.

== In literature ==
* A brindle horse was mentioned in the book &quot;Riding Lessons&quot; by Sara Gruen.
* &quot;Jock of the Bushveld&quot; was a brindle Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix and the companion of Percy FitzPatrick in his travels around the South African veldt in the 1880s. FitzPatrick later collected tales of their adventures into a popular book of the same name.
* Jack the bulldog featured in the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; books by Laura Ingalls Wilder had a brindled coat. He was the companion and household protector of the Ingalls family in their early travels. He dies of old age at the beginning of &quot;By the Shores of Silver Lake&quot;.
* In Gerard Manley Hopkins&#x27; poem &quot;Pied Beauty&quot; (1918), the concept occurs in the opening:
::: Glory be to God for dappled things —
::: For skies of couple-color as a brinded cow; 
::: For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim ...

===But &quot;not&quot; Shakespeare ===
In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the opening of act 4, scene 1, is often taken to refer to a brindled cat in the sense of coat pattern as described in this article, because it does contain the word &quot;brinded&quot;:
:&quot;Thrice the brinded cat hath mew&#x27;d.&quot;
However, in this context – Elizabethan English – the word &quot;brinded&quot; was used to mean &quot;branded&quot;, as in marked by fire. The word in Elizabethans used to describe a brindle-colored coat was &quot;streaked&quot;.

<text>Kirkby-in-Ashfield is a market town in the Ashfield District of Nottinghamshire, England. With a population of 25,265 (according to the 2001 National Census), it is a part of the wider Mansfield Urban Area. The Head Offices of Ashfield District Council are located on Urban Road in the town centre.

==Overview==
Kirkby-in-Ashfield lies on the eastern edge of the Erewash Valley which separates Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Kirkby, as it is locally known, was originally a Danish settlement (Kirk-by translates as &#x27;Church Town&#x27; in Danish) and is a collection of small villages including Old Kirkby, The Folly (East Kirkby), Nuncargate and Kirkby Woodhouse. It is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; and has two main churches: St Wilfrid&#x27;s, a Norman church, which was gutted by fire on 6 January 1907 but quickly re-built; and St Thomas&#x27;, built in the early 1910s in neo-gothic style.

==History==

===Kirkby Manor===

Kirkby Manor dated back to the 13th Century. Its owner in 1284 Robert de Stuteville was fined by King Edward I for not attending the Royal summons. However, in 1292 Robert clearly forgiven, hosted the king at the manor to a nights stay.

===Tudor times===

Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1530, travelled through Sutton in Ashfield having been recalled to London by King Henry VIII, before he stayed at nearby Kirkby Hardwick.

Charles Cavendish (landowner, born 1553) son of Bess of Hardwick had built a house in 1598 in Kirkby.

===Coal and transport===

Kirkby-in-Ashfield was once an important centre of coal mining and railways in west Nottinghamshire, with three active coal mines and several railway junctions. The former Mansfield and Pinxton Railway from the Erewash Valley Line was joined here by the later Midland Railway line from Nottingham. The Great Central Railway main line passed to the south-west side of the town and had a double junction with the Great Northern Railway Leen Valley Extension line to Langwith Junction and the Mansfield Railway to Clipstone.

===Rail stations===

The town has been served by four stations. Only one is now open:

*Kirkby-in-Ashfield East was the main station for the town on the former Midland Railway line between Nottingham and Mansfield. It closed in the 1960s.
*Kirkby-in-Ashfield on the Robin Hood Line was opened in the 1990s and replaced the former station at Kirkby East.
*Kirkby-in-Ashfield Central was opened on the now-defunct Mansfield Railway. It closed in the 1950s to passengers and the site is now an industrial estate, although the old station master&#x27;s house can still be seen.
*Kirkby Bentinck was opened on the Great Central Main Line from Nottingham Victoria to Sheffield Victoria. The station closed in the 1960s and the site has been cleared, although the old station masters house is still in situ. This was the only mainline station in the entire Ashfield and Mansfield District area. With the other being at Annesley and Hollinwell.

The town rapidly expanded during the Victorian era. However the closure of the coal mines in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a major slump in the local economy, and the area then suffered a high level of socio-economic depression.

==Regeneration==

In 2013, plans were introduced to create a new civic square from what was a car park. Nearby permanent market stalls were removed in October 2014.

The town centre underwent further upgrading, starting in late 2014 and 2015 to include the demolition of the old Co-Operative foodstore and county library with surrounding pedestrian plaza, to be rebuilt with a Morrisons store.

A new indoor market – named Moor Market – was created in 2021 by internally joining adjacent small retail shops into a larger space.

In 2021, a new leisure centre was developed including a swimming pool for the first time in Kirkby, partially on land originally purchased in 1935 by Kirkby Urban District Council, to replace the old Festival Hall.

==Education==

The town has two large secondary schools, Ashfield School and Outwood Academy Kirkby.

==Politics==

Local politics were dominated by the Labour Party for much of the 20th century; however, Ashfield attracted media attention in the late 1970s with a shock by-election win for the Conservatives. From the 2010 General Election until her stepping down in 2019, the MP was Gloria De Piero, best known for her work with GMTV. She took over from Geoff Hoon, one-time Secretary of State for Defence during the premiership of Tony Blair. She was elected with a very slim majority of 192 votes from the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Jason Zadrozny. In 2019, Conservative Lee Anderson won the seat.

The town&#x27;s most famous historical resident is Harold Larwood; the England cricketer who was born in Nuncargate in 1904, best known for his bodyline bowling in the Ashes Test series of 1932–33.

The area around St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church is designated a conservation area, and consists of former farm buildings built from local stone, some of which are listed. In the conservation area, at the junction of Church Street, Chapel Street and Sutton Road, is Kirkby Cross. This is the remains of a thirteenth-century village cross in dressed stone, and is a listed structure and designated ancient monument.

==Media==
The town receives its television signals from various regional transmitters: Waltham (BBC East Midlands/ITV Central East), Belmont (BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire/ITV Yorkshire), and Sutton Coldfield (BBC West Midlands/ITV Central West). 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Nottingham on 95.5 FM, Capital East Midlands on 96.5 FM and community based station Mansfield 103.2 FM which broadcast from Mansfield. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Mansfield and Ashfield Chad&quot;.

<doc id="1105245" wikidata="Q16934346" url="?curid=1105245" title="1980 October Surprise theory">
<text>The 1980 October Surprise theory refers to the claim that members of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign covertly negotiated with Iranian leaders to undermine incumbent President Jimmy Carter by delaying the release of 66 American hostages detained in Iran. The hostage situation, which began when Iranian revolutionaries seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran, was one of the biggest news stories of 1980, and Carter&#x27;s inability to resolve it is widely believed to have contributed to his loss. 

After 12 years of varying media attention, both houses of the United States Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that credible evidence supporting the allegation was absent or insufficient. Nevertheless, several individuals—most notably, former Iranian President Abulhassan Banisadr, former Lieutenant Governor of Texas Ben Barnes, former naval intelligence officer and U.S. National Security Council member Gary Sick, and Barbara Honegger, a former campaign staffer and White House analyst for Reagan and his successor, George H. W. Bush—have stood by the allegation.

In November 1979, a number of U.S. hostages were captured in Iran during the Iranian Revolution. The Iran hostage crisis continued into 1980; as the November 1980 presidential election approached, there were concerns in the Republican Party that a resolution of the crisis could constitute an &quot;October surprise&quot; which might give incumbent Jimmy Carter enough of an electoral boost to be re-elected. After the release of the hostages on January 20, 1981, mere minutes after Republican challenger Ronald Reagan&#x27;s inauguration, some charged that the Reagan campaign had made a secret deal with the Iranian government whereby the Iranians would hold the hostages until after Reagan was elected and inaugurated.

The issue of an &quot;October Surprise&quot; was brought up during an investigation by a House of Representatives Subcommittee into how the 1980 Reagan Campaign obtained debate briefing materials of then-President Carter. During that investigation, sometimes referred to as Debategate, the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee obtained access to Reagan Campaign documents. The documents included numerous references to a monitoring effort for any such October Surprise. The Subcommittee, chaired by former U.S. Representative Donald Albosta (D–MI), issued a comprehensive report on May 17, 1984, describing each type of information that was detected and its possible source. A section of the report was dedicated to the October Surprise issue.

==Origins==
The first printed instance of the October Surprise theory has been attributed to a story in the December 2, 1980, issue of &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot;, a periodical published by followers of Lyndon LaRouche, prior to the release of the hostages. Written by Robert Dreyfuss, the article cited &quot;Iranian sources&quot; in Paris as well as &quot;Top level intelligence sources in Reagan&#x27;s inner circle&quot; as saying that Henry Kissinger met with representatives of Mohammad Beheshti during the week of November 12, 1980. The story claimed that &quot;pro-Reagan British intelligence circles and the Kissinger faction&quot; meeting with the Iranians six to eight weeks prior had interfered with &quot;President Carter&#x27;s efforts to secure an arms-for-hostage deal with Teheran&quot;. The LaRouche movement returned to the story in the September 2, 1983, issue of &quot;New Solidarity,&quot; stating &quot;The deal ... fell through when the hard-line mullahs boycotted the Majlis in late October.&quot;

The theory garnered little attention until news of the Iran–Contra affair broke in November 1986. John M. Barry of &quot;Newsweek&quot; has said that Iran–Contra &quot;created fertile ground for the October Surprise theory&quot;. Scott D&#x27;Amico in &quot;Conspiracies and Conspiracy Theories in American History&quot; wrote that &quot;[t]he arms-deal arrangement provided credence to those who believed Reagan was fulfilling his end of the October surprise pact with Khomeni.&quot; In the November 24, 1986, issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, William Safire charged: &quot;The geopolitical excuse offered now - that the ransom was a plan to influence post-Khomeini Iran - is a feeble cover-up. Robert McFarlane first approached the Reagan campaign in the summer of 1980 with an Iranian in tow who proposed to deliver our hostages to Mr. Reagan rather than President Carter, thereby swinging the U.S. election. The Reagan representatives properly recoiled, but Mr. McFarlane has had Iranian held hostages on the brain ever since.&quot; Safire&#x27;s piece was based upon information he solicited from Laurence Silberman in 1984 regarding a brief meeting four years earlier between Silberman, McFarlane, and Richard V. Allen with a Malaysian man who proposed a plan to contact someone who could influence Iran to delay the release of the hostages in order to embarrass the Carter administration. Silberman later wrote: &quot;Ironically, it was I who unwittingly initiated the so-called &#x27;October Surprise&#x27; story, which grew into an utterly fantastic tale&quot;. An article by Bob Woodward and Walter Pincus a few days later in the November 29, 1986 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that United States officials tied to Reagan, well before the Iran Contra affair, considered an initiative to sell US-made military parts to Iran in exchange for the hostage held there. The House October Surprise Task Force credited the Woodward/Pincus article as raising &quot;claims that would become keystones in the October Surprise theory&quot;.

The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; published an article by Alfonso Chardy on April 12, 1987, that McFarlane, Silberman, and Allen had met with a man claiming to represent the Iranian government and offering the release of the hostages. Chardy&#x27;s article also quoted exiled former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr who said he had learned that Beheshti and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani were involved in negotiations with the Reagan campaign to delay the release of the hostages until Reagan became president.

==Chronology==

The House October Surprise Task Force outlined as &quot;principal allegations&quot; three supposed meetings between representatives of Reagan&#x27;s campaign and Iranian government officials in the summer and fall of 1980 to delay the release of the hostages: 1) a meeting in Madrid during the summer, 2) a meeting at the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington, D.C., that autumn, and 3) a meeting in Paris in October. The Task Force characterized three other alleged meetings or contacts as &quot;ancillary allegations&quot;: 1) a meeting at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in early spring 1980, 2) a meeting at the Churchill Hotel in London in the summer of 1980, and 3) a meeting at the Sherry Netherlands Hotel in New York in January 1981.

*March 1980: Jamshid Hashemi told Gary Sick he was visited by campaign manager William Casey and Roy Furmark while staying at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in March 1980. Hashemi claimed Casey was aware of his contacts in Iran and wanted to discuss the American hostages held there. He told Sick that he then reported the meeting to his &quot;intelligence contact&quot; Charles Cogan, then a senior official within the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Operations. Hashemi later testified that he was alone with Casey and denied telling Sick that Furmark was present, and that the meeting with Casey occurred in July 1980. The House October Surprise Task Force concluded that there was no credible evidence to support the allegations. The Task Force said that Hashemi was the only source of the story, that he provided no evidence to substantiate the allegations, that there were major inconsistencies in his story to different parties, and that there was credible documentary and testimonial evidence inconsistent with his allegations.
*Spring 1980: In an October 1990 interview, Jamshid Hashemi told Gary Sick he was introduced to Donald Gregg, a U.S. National Security Council aide with connections to George Bush, at Cyrus Hashemi&#x27;s office in New York City in the Spring of 1980. Jamshid told Sick that he and Cyrus had lunch with Gregg at a restaurant near Cyrus&#x27; office where they discussed the contacts that were underway between the brothers and the U.S. Government. The House October Surprise Task Force said that they found no credible evidence that Gregg met with the Hashemi&#x27;s, and noted that Jamshid recanted the allegation in testimony stating he had never met with Gregg. After Jamshid&#x27;s testimony denying that he told Sick that he met with Gregg, he told Sick that the person he met with was actually Robert Gray. The Task Force concluded that Jamshid Hashemi&#x27;s &quot;recent statements about this matter as totally devoid of credibility and probative of a tendency to modify his allegations to conform to subsequent revelations which are inconsistent with those allegations.&quot;
*July 1980: Jamshid Hashemi was also the principal source for allegations that an American delegation consisting of William Casey, Donald Gregg, and another unidentified American met with Iranian officials Mahdi Karrubi and his brother Hassan Karrubi at the Hotel Ritz in Madrid. first in July 1980 then again the following month. Jamshid Hashemi claimed he and his brother Cyrus Hashemi attended the meetings to provide translation services between the two parties. According to Jamshid Hashemi, Casey promised that in exchange for the hostages the new Reagan Administration would return all of Iranian&#x27;s frozen assets and military equipment that had been withheld by Carter. Jamshid Hashemi said Casey instructed the Iranians to hold the hostages until after the election. According to Jamshid, the meetings ended when Karrubi said he did not have the authority to make that commitment but would return to Tehran and seeking instructions from Ayatollah Khomeini. The Task Force said they &quot;determined that Jamshid Hashemi&#x27;s allegations regarding meetings in Madrid in the summer of 1980 are fabrications&quot; and that there was no credible evidence to support them.
* About August 12, 1980: Jamshid Hashemi alleged that Karrubi met again with Casey in Madrid, saying Khomeini had agreed to the proposal, and that Casey agreed the next day, naming Cyrus Hashimi as middleman to handle the arms transactions. Hashemi also alleged that more meetings were set for October. The House October Surprise Task Force concluded that these allegations were not credible. Cyrus Hashimi purchases a Greek ship and commences arms deliveries valued at $150 million from the Israeli port of Eilat to Bandar Abbas. According to CIA sources, Hashimi receives a $7 million commission.
* September 22, 1980: Iraq invades Iran.
* Late September 1980: An expatriate Iranian arms dealer named Hushang Lavi claims he met with Richard V. Allen, the Reagan campaign&#x27;s national security expert, Robert &quot;Bud&quot; McFarlane, and Lawrence Silberman, co-chairman of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy advisors during the campaign, and discussed the possible exchange of F-4 parts for American hostages, but Lavi says they asserted they &quot;were already in touch with the Iranians themselves&quot;.
*October 15–20: Meetings are held in Paris between emissaries of the Reagan-Bush campaign, with Casey as &quot;key participant&quot;, and &quot;high-level Iranian and Israeli representatives&quot;.
*October 21: Iran, for reasons not explained, abruptly shifts its position in secret negotiations with the Carter administration and disclaims &quot;further interest in receiving military equipment&quot;.
*October 21–23: Israel secretly ships F-4 fighter-aircraft tires to Iran, in violation of the U.S. arms embargo, and Iran disperses the hostages to different locations.
*January 20, 1981: Hostages are formally released into United States custody after spending 444 days in captivity. The release takes place just minutes after Ronald Reagan is sworn in as president.

==Investigations==
===Gary Sick===
The October Surprise allegations gained traction in the mainstream media after an editorial column by Gary Sick was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on April 15, 1991. Sick, who had served as President Carter&#x27;s Iranian expert on the National Security Council, wrote: &quot;I have been told repeatedly that individuals associated with the Reagan-Bush campaign of 1980 met secretly with Iranian officials to delay the release of the American hostages until after the presidential election. For this favor, Iran was rewarded with a substantial supply of arms from Israel.&quot; Sick wrote that members of the Reagan-Bush campaign had met with high-level representatives of Iran and Israel in a series of meeting in Paris between October 15–20, 1980, and that there were 15 sources who had direct or indirect knowledge of the event.

Sick later published a book (&quot;October Surprise: America&#x27;s Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan&quot;), published in November 1991, on the subject. Sick&#x27;s credibility was boosted by the fact that he was a retired naval captain, served on Ford&#x27;s, Carter&#x27;s, and Reagan&#x27;s National Security Council, and held high positions with many prominent organizations; moreover, he had authored a book recently on US-Iran relations (&quot;All Fall Down&quot;). Sick wrote that in October 1980, officials in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign, including future CIA Director William Casey, made a secret deal with Iran to delay the release of the American hostages until after the election; in return for this, the United States purportedly arranged for Israel to ship weapons to Iran.

Sick admitted that &quot;The story is tangled and murky, and it may never be fully unraveled.&quot; He was unable to prove his claims, including that, in the days before the presidential election with daily press pools surrounding him and a public travel schedule, vice presidential candidate George H. W. Bush secretly left the country and met with Iranian officials in France to discuss the fate of the hostages.

===&quot;Frontline&quot; / Robert Parry===
Sick&#x27;s editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; directed readers to watch the investigative documentary program &quot;Frontline&quot; the following evening to view interviews of his sources. In the &quot;Frontline&quot; episode released on April 16, 1991, Robert Parry &quot;investigate[d] startling new evidence about how both the Carter and Reagan camps may have tried to forge secret deals for [the Iranian] hostages during the 1980 presidential campaign.&quot; The program presented allegations 1) that Cyrus Hashemi and William Casey met in Madrid to delay the release of the hostages, 2) that there was a meeting in Paris to finalize the deal, and 3) that there were shipments of American-made arms from Israel to Iran.

In a second episode released on April 7, 1992, Parry &quot;investigate[d] whether or not William Casey, Reagan&#x27;s campaign director, could have met with Iranians in Paris and Madrid in the summer of 1980.&quot; This program discussed the alleged whereabouts of Casey and Mehdi Karroubi, the credibility of witnesses to the meetings, and other theories about the alleged evidence.

===Danny Casolaro===
In August 1991, freelance writer Danny Casolaro (among others) claimed to be almost ready to expose the alleged October surprise conspiracy, when he suddenly died a violent death in a hotel bathtub in Martinsburg, West Virginia, raising suspicions. He appeared to be traveling on leads for his investigation into the Inslaw Affair. His death was ruled a suicide. The case was the subject of a 2024 Netflix docuseries titled American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders.

===&quot;Newsweek&quot;===
&quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine also ran an investigation, reporting in November 1991 that most, if not all, of the charges made were groundless. Specifically, &quot;Newsweek&quot; found little evidence that the United States had transferred arms to Iran prior to Iran Contra, and was able to account for William Casey&#x27;s whereabouts when he was allegedly at the Madrid meeting, saying that he was at a conference in London. &quot;Newsweek&quot; also alleged that the story was being heavily pushed within the LaRouche Movement.

===&quot;The New Republic&quot;===
Steven Emerson and Jesse Furman of &quot;The New Republic&quot; also looked into the allegations and reported, in November 1991, that &quot;the conspiracy as currently postulated is a total fabrication&quot;. They were unable to verify any of the evidence presented by Sick and supporters, finding them to be inconsistent and contradictory in nature. They also pointed out that nearly every witness of Sick&#x27;s had either been indicted or was under investigation by the Department of Justice. Like the &quot;Newsweek&quot; investigation, they had also debunked the claims of Reagan election campaign officials being in Paris during the timeframe that Sick specified, contradicting Sick&#x27;s sources.

===&quot;The Village Voice&quot;===
Retired CIA analyst and counter-intelligence officer Frank Snepp of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; reviewed Sick&#x27;s allegations, publishing an article in February 1992. Snepp alleged that Sick had only interviewed half of the sources used in his book, and supposedly relied on hearsay from unreliable sources for large amounts of critical material. Snepp also discovered that Sick had sold the rights to his book to Oliver Stone in 1989. After going through evidence presented by Richard Brenneke, Snepp asserted that Brenneke&#x27;s credit card receipts showed him to be in Portland, Oregon, during the time he claimed to be in Paris observing the secret meeting.

===Senate investigation===
The US Senate&#x27;s November 1992 report concluded that &quot;by any standard, the credible evidence now known falls far short of supporting the allegation of an agreement between the Reagan campaign and Iran to delay the release of the hostages.&quot;

===House of Representatives investigation===

The House of Representatives&#x27; January 1993 report concluded &quot;there is no credible evidence supporting any attempt by the Reagan presidential campaign—or persons associated with the campaign—to delay the release of the American hostages in Iran&quot;. The task force Chairman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Indiana) also added that the vast majority of the sources and material reviewed by the committee were &quot;wholesale fabricators or were impeached by documentary evidence&quot;. The report also expressed the belief that several witnesses had committed perjury during their sworn statements to the committee, among them Richard Brenneke, who claimed to be a CIA agent.

==Allegations==
===Former Iranian President Banisadr===

This accusation was made in Banisadr&#x27;s 1989 memoir, which also claimed that Henry Kissinger plotted to set up a Palestinian state in the Iranian province of Khuzestan and that Zbigniew Brzezinski conspired with Saddam Hussein to plot Iraq&#x27;s 1980 invasion of Iran. &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; described the book as &quot;a rambling, self-serving series of reminiscences&quot; and &quot;long on sensational allegations and devoid of documentation that might lend credence to Bani-Sadr&#x27;s claims&quot;.

Writing again in 2013 in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Banisadr reiterated and elaborated on his earlier statements:
I was deposed in June 1981 as a result of a coup against me. After arriving in France, I told a BBC reporter that I had left Iran to expose the symbiotic relationship between Khomeinism and Reaganism. Ayatollah Khomeini and Ronald Reagan had organized a clandestine negotiation, later known as the &quot;October Surprise&quot;, which prevented the attempts by myself and then-US President Jimmy Carter to free the hostages before the 1980 US presidential election took place. The fact that they were not released tipped the results of the election in favor of Reagan.

Two of my advisors, Hussein Navab Safavi and Sadr-al-Hefazi, were executed by Khomeini&#x27;s regime because they had become aware of this secret relationship between Khomeini, his son Ahmad, the Islamic Republican Party, and the Reagan administration.
===Barbara Honegger===
Barbara Honegger was a campaign staffer and policy analyst for Reagan who resigned her post as a special assistant in the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division in 1983 after publicly criticizing what she claimed was the administration&#x27;s lack of commitment to gender equality. She claims that while working for Reagan she discovered information that made her believe that George H. W. Bush and William Casey had conspired to assure that Iran would not free the U.S. hostages until Jimmy Carter had been defeated in the 1980 presidential election, and she alleges that arms sales to Iran were a part of that bargain. In 1987, in the context of the Iran–Contra investigations, Honegger was reported as saying that shortly after October 22, 1980, when Iran abruptly changed the terms of its deal with Carter, a member of the Reagan campaign told her &quot;We don&#x27;t have to worry about an &#x27;October surprise.&#x27; Dick cut a deal,&quot; with &quot;Dick&quot; referring to Richard V. Allen.

===Michael Riconosciuto===
In context of his involvement in the Inslaw affair, Michael Riconosciuto claimed that Reagan associate Earl Brian worked on an agreement with the Iranian government to delay the release of the hostages, and that the software was stolen in order to raise funds for Brian&#x27;s payment.

===Kevin Phillips===
Political historian Kevin Phillips has been a proponent of the idea. In his 2004 book &quot;American Dynasty&quot;, although Phillips concedes that many of the specific allegations were proven false, he also argues that in his opinion, Reagan campaign officials &quot;probably&quot; were involved in a scheme &quot;akin to&quot; the specific scheme alleged by Sick.

===Chase Bank revelations===
In a memoir by Joseph V. Reed Jr. it is revealed that the &quot;team&quot; around David Rockefeller &quot;collaborated closely with the Reagan campaign in its efforts to pre-empt and discourage what it derisively labeled an &quot;October surprise&quot; — a pre-election release of the American hostages, the papers show. The Chase team helped the Reagan campaign gather and spread rumors about possible payoffs to win the release, a propaganda effort that Carter administration officials have said impeded talks to free the captives.&quot;

===Duane &quot;Dewey&quot; Clarridge===
Shortly after the death of Duane Clarridge in April 2016, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published an article by Nicholas Schou claiming that the former CIA operations officer and Iran–Contra figure had previously told him that the October Surprise conspiracy as depicted in George Cave&#x27;s novel, &quot;October 1980&quot;, was &quot;really true&quot;. Schou noted that Cave denied actually believing that officials working on behalf of Reagan plotted to delay the release of the hostages.

===Declassified 1980 CIA memo===
In 2017, a declassified CIA 1980 memo was released in which the agency concluded &quot;Iranian hardliners – especially Ayatollah Khomeini&quot; were &quot;determined to exploit the hostage issue to bring about President Carter&#x27;s defeat in the November elections.&quot; MuckRock, a press organization specialized in Freedom of Information Act requests, argued that &quot;While the document doesn&#x27;t prove the Reagan campaign intended to collude with Iran, it does document Iran&#x27;s motives and matches the October Surprise narrative outlined by former CIA officers George Cave and Duane &#x27;Dewey&#x27; Clarridge.&quot;

===Ben Barnes===
In March 2023, Peter Baker reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that former Texas governor John Connally, who had sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1980, travelled to several Arab countries and Israel between July 1980 and August 1980. According to Connally&#x27;s close associate Ben Barnes, who accompanied him on the trip, Connally told the Arab officials whom he spoke with to relay a message to Iran to the effect that &quot;Ronald Reagan&#x27;s going to be elected president and you need to get the word to Iran that they&#x27;re going to make a better deal with Reagan than they are Carter.&quot; Barnes also recounted accompanying Connally to a September 1980 meeting in Houston in which Connally briefed William J. Casey, Reagan&#x27;s campaign manager and a central figure in many versions of the &quot;October Surprise&quot; theory, on the outcome of the trip, with Casey specifically asking if &quot;[the Iranians] were going to hold the hostages.&quot;

While there is documentation that this trip to the Middle East occurred and that Connally communicated with close Reagan associates during the trip, Baker states that there are &quot;no diaries or memos to corroborate&quot; Barnes&#x27;s recollection of what, specifically, Connally told the Arab officials. Additionally, Barnes&#x27;s account does not confirm &quot;debunked previous theories of what happened,&quot; such as the Reagan campaign reaching an arms-for-hostages agreement with Iran prior to the outcome of the 1980 election. Barnes avoided scrutiny during the congressional &quot;October Surprise&quot; investigations, but his anecdote about Connally had been previously published in H. W. Brands&#x27;s 2015 biography of Reagan, albeit &quot;generat[ing] little public notice at the time&quot; according to Baker. Barnes acknowledged not being in a position to assess personal involvement by Reagan himself or the effect (if any) that Connally&#x27;s overture may have had on Iranian actions.

In May 2023, Sick, former Carter administration Chief Domestic Policy Advisor Stuart E. Eizenstat, author Kai Bird, and journalist Jonathan Alter published an article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; outlining the various allegations and circumstantial evidence (including Barnes&#x27; allegations) that have emerged in the decades following the earlier investigations, declaring the credibility of the theory to be &quot;all but settled.&quot;

<text>An alarm clock or alarm is a clock that is designed to alert an individual or group of people at a specified time. The primary function of these clocks is to awaken people from their night&#x27;s sleep or short naps; they can sometimes be used for other reminders as well. Most alarm clocks make sounds; some make light or vibration. Some have sensors to identify when a person is in a light stage of sleep, in order to avoid waking someone who is deeply asleep, which causes tiredness, even if the person has had adequate sleep. To turn off the sound or light, a button or handle on the clock is pressed; most clocks automatically turn off the alarm if left unattended long enough. A classic analog alarm clock has an extra hand or inset dial that is used to show the time at which the alarm will ring. Alarm clock functions are also used in mobile phones, watches, and computers.

Many alarm clocks have radio receivers that can be set to start playing at specified times, and are known as &quot;clock radios&quot;. Additionally, some alarm clocks can set multiple alarms. A &quot;progressive alarm clock&quot; can have different alarms for different times (see next-generation alarms) and play music of the user&#x27;s choice. Most modern televisions, computers, mobile phones and digital watches have alarm functions that automatically turn on or sound alerts at a specific time.

== Types ==
=== Traditional analogue clocks ===
Traditional mechanical alarm clocks have one or two bells that ring by means of a mainspring that powers a gear to quickly move a hammer back and forth between the two bells, or between the internal sides of a single bell. In some models, the metal cover at back of the clock itself also functions as the bell. In an electronically operated bell-type alarm clock, the bell is rung by an electromagnetic circuit with an armature that turns the circuit on and off repeatedly.

=== Digital ===
Digital alarm clocks can make other noises. Simple battery-powered alarm clocks make a loud buzzing, ringing or beeping sound to wake a sleeper, while novelty alarm clocks can speak, laugh, sing, or play sounds from nature.

== History ==

The ancient Greek philosopher Plato (428–348 BCE) was said to possess a large water clock with an unspecified alarm signal similar to the sound of a water organ; he used it at night, possibly for signaling the beginning of his lectures at dawn (Athenaeus 4.174c). The Hellenistic engineer and inventor Ctesibius (fl. 285–222 BCE) fitted his clepsydras with dial and pointer for indicating the time, and added elaborate &quot;alarm systems, which could be made to drop pebbles on a gong, or blow trumpets (by forcing bell-jars down into water and taking the compressed air through a beating reed) at pre-set times&quot; (Vitruv 11.11).

The late Roman statesman Cassiodorus (c. 485–585) advocated in his rulebook for monastic life the water clock as a useful alarm for the &quot;soldiers of Christ&quot; (Cassiod. Inst. 30.4 f.). The Christian rhetorician Procopius described in detail prior to 529 a complex public striking clock in his home town Gaza which featured an hourly gong and figures moving mechanically day and night.

In China, a striking clock was devised by the Buddhist monk and inventor Yi Xing (683–727). The Chinese engineers Zhang Sixun and Su Song integrated striking clock mechanisms in astronomical clocks in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. A striking clock outside of China was the water-powered clock tower near the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria, which struck once every hour. It is the subject of a book, &quot;On the Construction of Clocks and their Use&quot; (1203), by Riḍwān ibn al-Sāʿātī, the son of clockmaker. In 1235, an early monumental water-powered alarm clock that &quot;announced the appointed hours of prayer and the time both by day and by night&quot; was completed in the entrance hall of the Mustansiriya Madrasah in Baghdad.

From the 14th century, some clock towers in Western Europe were also capable of chiming at a fixed time every day; the earliest of these was described by the Florentine writer Dante Alighieri in 1319. The most famous original striking clock tower still standing is possibly the one in St Mark&#x27;s Clocktower in St Mark&#x27;s Square, Venice. The St Mark&#x27;s Clock was assembled in 1493, by the famous clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia, where his father Gian Paolo Rainieri had already constructed another famous device in 1481. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell (h. 1,56 m., diameter m. 1,27), which was put on the top of the tower where it was alternatively beaten by the &quot;Due Mori&quot; (&quot;Two Moors&quot;), two bronze statues (h. 2,60) handling a hammer.

User-settable mechanical alarm clocks date back at least to 15th-century Europe. These early alarm clocks had a ring of holes in the clock dial and were set by placing a pin in the appropriate hole.

The first American alarm clock was created in 1787 by Levi Hutchins in Concord, New Hampshire. This device he made only for himself, however, and it only rang at 4 am, in order to wake him for his job. The French inventor Antoine Redier was the first to patent an adjustable mechanical alarm clock, in 1847.

Alarm clocks, like almost all other consumer goods in the United States, ceased production in the spring of 1942, as the factories which made them were converted over to war work during World War II, but they were one of the first consumer items to resume manufacture for civilian use, in November 1944. By that time, a critical shortage of alarm clocks had developed due to older clocks wearing out or breaking down. Workers were late for, or missed completely, their scheduled shifts in jobs critical to the war effort. In a pooling arrangement overseen by the Office of Price Administration, several clock companies were allowed to start producing new clocks, some of which were continuations of pre-war designs, and some of which were new designs, thus becoming among the first &quot;postwar&quot; consumer goods to be made, before the war had even ended. The price of these &quot;emergency&quot; clocks was, however, still strictly regulated by the Office of Price Administration.

The first radio alarm clock was invented by James F. Reynolds, in the 1940s and another design was also invented by Paul L. Schroth Sr.

== Clock radio ==

A clock radio is an alarm clock and radio receiver integrated in one device. The clock may turn on the radio at a designated time to wake the user, and usually includes a buzzer alarm. Typically, clock radios are placed on the bedside stand. Some models offer dual alarm for awakening at different times and &quot;snooze&quot;, usually a large button on the top that silences the alarm and sets it to resume sounding a few minutes later. Some clock radios also have a &quot;sleep&quot; timer, which turns the radio on for a set amount of time (usually around one hour). This is useful for people who like to fall asleep while listening to the radio.

Newer clock radios are available with other music sources such as iPod, iPhone, and/or audio CD. When the alarm is triggered, it can play a set radio station or the music from a selected music source to awaken the sleeper. Some models come with a dock for iPod/iPhone that also charges the device while it is docked. They can play AM/FM radio, iPod/iPhone or CD like a typical music player as well (without being triggered by the alarm function). A few popular models offer &quot;nature sounds&quot; like rain, forest, wind, sea, waterfall etc., in place of the buzzer.

Clock radios are powered by AC power from the wall socket. In the event of a power interruption, older electronic digital models used to reset the time to midnight (00:00) and lose alarm settings. This would cause failure to trigger the alarm even if the power is restored, such as in the event of a power outage. Many newer clock radios feature a battery backup to maintain the time and alarm settings. Some advanced radio clocks (not to be confused with clocks with AM/FM radios) have a feature which sets the time automatically using signals from atomic clock-synced time signal radio stations such as WWV, making the clock accurate and immune to time reset due to power interruptions.

== Alarms in technology ==
=== Computer alarms===
Alarm clock software programs have been developed for personal computers. There are Web-based alarm clocks, some of which may allow a virtually unlimited number of alarm times (i.e. Personal information manager) and personalized tones. However, unlike mobile phone alarms, online alarm clocks have some limitations. They do not work when the computer is shut off or in sleep mode. Native applications, however, can wake the computer up from sleep using the built-in real-time clock alarm chip or even power it back on after it had been shut down.

=== Mobile phone alarms ===

Many modern mobile phones feature built-in alarm clocks that do not need the phone to be switched on for the alarm to ring off. Some of these mobile phones feature the ability for the user to set the alarm&#x27;s ringtone, and in some cases music can be downloaded to the phone and then chosen to play for waking.

== Next-generation alarms ==
Scientific studies on sleep having shown that sleep stage at awakening is an important factor in amplifying sleep inertia. Alarm clocks involving &quot;sleep stage monitoring&quot; appeared on the market in 2005. The alarm clocks use sensing technologies such as EEG electrodes and accelerometers to wake people from sleep. Dawn simulators are another technology meant to mediate these effects.

Sleepers can become accustomed to the sound of their alarm clock if it has been used for a period of time, making it less effective. Due to progressive alarm clocks&#x27; complex waking procedure, they can deter this adaptation due to the body needing to adapt to more stimuli than just a simple sound alert.

=== Alarm signals for impaired hearing ===
The deaf and hard of hearing are often unable to perceive auditory alarms when asleep. They may use specialized alarms, including alarms with flashing lights instead of or in addition to noise. Alarms which can connect to vibrating devices (small ones inserted into pillows, or larger ones placed under bedposts to shake the bed) also exist.

== Time switches ==

Time switches can be used to turn on anything that will awaken a sleeper, and can therefore be used as alarms. Lights, bells, and radio and TV sets can easily be used. More elaborate devices have also been used, such as machines that automatically prepare tea or coffee. A sound is produced when the drink is ready, so the sleeper awakes to find the freshly brewed drink waiting.

<text>The West London line (WLL) is a railway line in inner West London that links in the north to in the south. The line has always been an important cross-London link, especially for freight services. Southern and London Overground provide regular passenger services; detailed below.

In November 2024, the London Overground service on the line was named, along with that on the North London line, the Mildmay line (to honour the Mildmay Mission Hospital which treated victims of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s) and coloured light blue on the Tube map.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The Birmingham, Bristol and Thames Junction Railway was authorised in 1836 to run from the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR), near the present Willesden Junction station, across the proposed route of the Great Western Railway (GWR) on the level, to the Kensington Canal Basin. For about twelve years, the railway ran alongside the Kensington Canal, formerly Counter&#x27;s Creek, a minor tributary of the Thames River until it was filled in, the water course turned into a sewer and the future District line built over it. Construction was delayed by engineering and financial problems. Renamed the West London Railway (WLR) the line officially opened on 27 May 1844, and regular services began on 10 June, but before that trials to demonstrate the potential of the atmospheric railway system had been held from 1840 to 1843 on a half-mile section of track adjacent to Wormwood Scrubs, leased to that system&#x27;s promoters; The WLR used conventional power but was not a commercial success. After only six months it closed on 30 November 1844.

The London and Birmingham Railway Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clvi) authorised the GWR and the L&amp;BR (which became part of the London and North Western Railway [LNWR] in 1846) to take a joint lease of the WLR. The line was used only to carry coal, and passenger service was not re-introduced. The lack of success of the line became such a regular target of &quot;Punch&quot; magazine that the line was called &quot;Punch&#x27;s Railway&quot;.

The West London Extension Railway Act 1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. cxxxiv) granted those two companies, with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) and the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR), powers to construct the West London Extension Joint Railway on the filled-in canal south from the Kensington Basin to the bridge under the Kings Road, to bridge the Thames and to connect near Clapham Junction to railways south of the river. The existing line was doubled, and the flat crossing of the GWR main line, where a number of collisions had occurred, was replaced by a flyover. The new line opened on 2 March 1863 with a passenger station at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)) slightly north of the original Kensington station, and was then well used by various inner London services for the remainder of the nineteenth century.

=== Operations to 1940 ===
For a time, the West London line formed part of the GWR&#x27;s Middle Circle route (1872–1905) which ran (clockwise) from to (originally Moorgate) via , Kensington Olympia, and . The West London line was also part of London Underground for a time and operated as a branch of the Metropolitan Railway between and Addison Road. The branch was eventually closed and the link between the West London line and today&#x27;s Hammersmith &amp; City line was dismantled in 1930.

A branch was installed to allow trains from the former Southern Railway to access to the West Coast Main Line and vice versa: in summer the London Midland and Scottish Railway ran from as far north as Glasgow to the South Coast. Through trains in the steam era changed locomotives here. From the 1920s there was a United Dairies depot on the site of a former dairy farm here, which up until the late 1970s had regular milk train deliveries.

The northern section of the line, from Willesden Junction to Kensington Olympia and on to Earls Court, was electrified by the LNWR in 1915.

=== Decline after World War II ===
After a period of popularity, passenger usage dwindled on the West London Railway. Competition from the new deep-level Underground railways and electric tramways took away custom by offering more direct routes into Central London. With the onset of World War II, the West London line was badly hit in some parts by enemy action during the Blitz and the demise of the line was hastened by wartime bombing. In 1940, LMS steam trains from to Kensington ceased on 20 October and the services to Willesden and Edgware Road Met electric services ceased on 3 and 20 October respectively.

In 1948, the line became part of British Rail, following the nationalisation of the railways, but remained mostly in use as a freight route. For many years, limited passenger trains ran on workday mornings and evenings, to carry workers at the Post Office Savings Bank headquarters, Blythe House, near Olympia from Clapham Junction and back again, but these services were not publicly advertised.

Kensington Olympia was used as late as the 1970s as a location for collecting milk tanks (for the west country) from various terminals in the London area such as Ilford. This activity later transferred to Clapham Junction.

=== Reinstatement of passenger services ===
Since the 1940s the line has often been used for excursion and other special through trains across London to the South Coast. Between April 1963 and June 1965 the section between Willesden Jn and Kensington Olympia was used for trains diverted from Euston during the rebuilding of Euston station section. Kensington Olympia station was refurbished accordingly. During 1967 passenger services were diverted from Paddington between Old Oak Common and Kensington Olympia during engineering works at Paddington station.

In the late 1970s, the Greater London Council began to revitalise the North London line (NLL), incorporating it onto the Tube Map in 1977 as a white line with black borders marked &quot;British Rail&quot; and electrifying the route from Dalston to Woolwich in 1985. The limited Clapham Junction – Kensington Olympia service appeared in the public timetables, but full passenger services on the West London line were not re-introduced until 1994 by Network SouthEast service. In 1997, as part of the privatisation of British Rail, operation of both the West London line and North London line was brought under the North London Railway franchise, and taken over by National Express, trading as Silverlink. For a decade, the West London line was operated with the green-and-purple liveried Silverlink Metro trains.

Channel Tunnel infrastructure work in 1993 electrified the line at 750 V DC third rail from the South to the North Pole depot. The line is electrified at 25 kV AC overhead wires from Westway (near the overbridge carrying the Hammersmith and City Line) to Willesden and the North. Until the High Speed 1 railway line from opened in November 2007, Eurostar trains from used the West London line to access their North Pole depot.

The line was crucial to the planned Regional Eurostar service, and between 1995 and 1997 carried two daily services connecting the ECML and WCML respectively to Waterloo for international passengers. However the idea was cancelled.

Platforms were reinstated at West Brompton in 1999. In 2007, Transport for London took over the North London Railway franchise as the London Overground concession, introducing new rolling stock and rebranding the West London line trains and stations in orange livery. The line appears today on the Tube Map as an orange stripe. New stations opened at in 2008 and in 2009, bringing main line rail services to a large catchment area in West London.

=== Regional and InterCity services ===
In 1966 British Rail launched Motorail, a long-distance accompanied car train which transported passengers and their cars to the West of England and Scotland. The London Motorail terminal was at Kensington (Olympia), using the West London line for its wide connections to the UK mainline rail network. Motorail ceased operations in 1981.

Intercity prior to 1997, and then from 1997 to 2007 Virgin CrossCountry operated a long-distance service between and and , in addition Intercity operated Summer Saturday services Liverpool to Dover Western Docks and Manchester to Eastbourne which use the West London line route to cross from , stopping at Olympia and passing through Clapham Junction. The CrossCountry franchise was taken over by Arriva CrossCountry and in 2008 the Brighton route was terminated.

In 2009, Southern introduced its cross-London service from Milton Keynes to East Croydon. For a brief period, Southern and Connex also operated a direct service from to via , but this was withdrawn in 2001.

== Train services ==

=== London Overground ===

The core operation of the West London line is the metro/commuter rail operated by London Overground. Four trains per hour run between Clapham Junction and Willesden Junction, with most trains continuing on the North London line to and from Stratford. It forms the western section of the Overground&#x27;s orbital rail route which was completed in December 2012 when the East London line was extended to Clapham Junction via the South London line, linking it to the West London line.

In July 2023, TFL announced that it would be giving each of the six Overground services unique names by the end of the following year. In February 2024, it was confirmed that services on the line would be named the &quot;Mildmay line&quot; (to honour the Mildmay Hospital which treated victims of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s) and would be coloured blue on the updated network map. The new name started to be used in November 2024.

=== Cross-London services ===
Along with the Thameslink and the East London line routes, the West London line presently forms part of the West London Route which is one of three National Rail routes which run across London instead of terminating in the central area. This regional rail service operated by Southern connects the West Coast Main Line in the north to the Brighton Main Line in the south. Hourly trains run between and , with additional peak services between and . Southern services pass through Willesden Junction without stopping as the mainline platforms were removed in 1962. However there are plans for these services to stop at Willesden Junction in the future which will mean building new main line platforms at Willesden Junction.

This regional service previously ran from to Watford Junction. It was originally conceived as a Brighton-Birmingham service, and until December 2008 a twice-daily CrossCountry service ran from Brighton via Kensington (Olympia) and to . The service was curtailed due to the difficulty in securing train paths in the congested West Midlands, and operated only as far as . With engineering works on the upgrade of the West Coast Main Line, the service was shortened to terminate at Watford, and was discontinued, later revived as a shorter regional route as part of the South Central franchise in 2008. Due to congestion on the West Coast Main Line, the service did not run north of , and in May 2022 was curtailed to Watford Junction.

== Route ==
From north to south, to line follows the following route with current and former stations, junctions with other railways and other features:

=== Current Route ===
=== Former Route ===
The West Cross Route, one side of the Ringway 1 inner ring road, would have paralleled the line.

== Rolling stock ==
Trains in scheduled passenger services on the West London line are as follows:
== Passenger volume ==

These are passenger volume statistics for the line from the years beginning April 2002 to April 2022. The large increases in the year beginning April 2006 were due to travelcards for National Rail journeys being made available from stations with London Underground ticket offices, and also using a different methodology to estimate likely journeys made from National Rail stations in Zone 1. The large increases in the year beginning April 2010 were due to increased train frequencies helped by the introduction of new rolling stock. Shepherd&#x27;s Bush opened 2008 and Imperial Wharf the following year. There was a significant change in methodology for estimating usage of London stations in 2015–16, resulting in large changes in usage numbers for some stations.

== Future ==

The Crossrail project instated the Elizabeth line, a new east-west cross-London route which uses the Great Western Main Line up to , and crosses the West London line south of Willesden Junction at Old Oak Common. A new station, Old Oak Common railway station, is planned at this site to provide an interchange between the Elizabeth line, the GWML and High Speed 2. Due to the proximity of Willesden Junction, it has been suggested that an interchange could be added with the North London, Bakerloo, Watford DC and West London lines. A 2010 Department for Transport command paper highlights opportunities for interchanges at Old Oak Common with London Underground, London Overground and Southern&#x27;s cross-London services, while a report prepared by Terry Farrell and Partners for the Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham proposes the construction of an overhead light rail, automated people mover or personal rapid transit system linking &quot;Old Oak Central&quot; with Willesden Junction. However, , no firm proposals exist to create an interchange with these lines.

Proposals for Old Oak Common being considered by Transport for London include a scheme to realign the routes of both the West London and North London lines around the Old Oak Common site to create a new London Overground interchange station. The proposal envisages diverting the NLL Richmond route to curve around the eastern side of Old Oak Common, and re-routing the WLL to branch west south of the Mitre Bridge before curving north along a short section of the Dudding Hill Line to join the West Coast Main Line. The NLL and WLL would meet at a point on the southern side of Old Oak Common, adjacent to Wormwood Scrubs, where new interchange platforms would be built. Alternative versions of this scheme also consider cheaper options such as terminating the WLL at Old Oak Common or two separate London Overground stations.

The West London line passes beneath the Earls Court Exhibition Centre along a complex intersection of track which crosses over the subsurface junction of three District line branches. The planned redevelopment of the site by Capital &amp; Counties Properties envisages demolishing the Exhibition Centre to make way for retail and housing; as part of these plans, the West London line is to be enclosed by a concrete box. Commentators have noted that the proposals make no allowance for any future quadrupling of the track to increase capacity on the line.

<doc id="1105249" wikidata="Q16209485" url="?curid=1105249" title="Has Been">
<text>Has Been is William Shatner&#x27;s second musical album after 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Transformed Man&quot;, released in 2004. The album was produced and arranged by Ben Folds and most of the songs are co-written by Folds and Shatner, with Folds creating arrangements for Shatner&#x27;s prose-poems. The album features guest appearances from Joe Jackson (on a cover of Pulp&#x27;s &quot;Common People&quot;), Folds and Aimee Mann (backup vocals on &quot;That&#x27;s Me Trying&quot;), Lemon Jelly (on &quot;Together&quot;), Henry Rollins, Adrian Belew (on &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Behind That&quot;), and Brad Paisley (on &quot;Real&quot;, which he wrote specifically for Shatner).

==History==
Joe Jackson explained his involvement in an interview, saying, &quot;That came through Ben Folds, who&#x27;s a big fan of mine. You’d have to ask him how he got hooked up with Bill Shatner, I don&#x27;t remember. But I think he did a really great job of putting an album behind Shatner that is fun and not completely cheesy, though when it is too cheesy, it&#x27;s deliberately so. (laughs) It&#x27;s just a very musically satisfying record, and when he asked me to be a part of it, why would I not? How could I refuse? I went to Nashville for a few days and hung out with the two of them, and we created a couple of masterpieces.&quot; He ultimately said about working with Shatner, &quot;He&#x27;s wonderful, very musical, and very funny, because he&#x27;s so obviously in on the joke&quot;.

Originally, Weezer and former U.S. President Bill Clinton were set to be featured on the album but by the time Weezer responded, Clinton had already backed out.

In 2007, a ballet called &quot;Common People&quot;, set to &quot;Has Been&quot;, was created by Margo Sappington (of &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; fame) and performed by the Milwaukee Ballet. Shatner attended the première and had the event filmed. This footage became &quot;William Shatner&#x27;s Gonzo Ballet&quot;, a feature film which premiered at the Nashville Film Festival on April 17, 2009. The documentary also features interviews with Shatner, Folds, and Henry Rollins.

<text>Osmaston is a suburb of Derby, in the ceremonial county of Derbyshire, England. It is about 3 miles south of the city centre. It is written in the Domesday Book as &quot;Osmundestune&quot;. In 1307, the manor of Osmaston was granted to Robert Holland. It was the location of Osmaston Hall, the residence of the Wilmot baronets of Osmaston.

==History==
There are two places called Osmaston in Derbyshire. This Osmaston and another in the Derbyshire Dales. It has been this way for at least 900 years. Both places are mentioned in the Domesday Book and are called &quot;Osmundestune&quot;.
The manor in Derby was the home of the ancient family of the Wilmot baronets. These baronets built Osmaston Hall, including its chapel of James the Lesser. The hall was demolished to make way for the Ascot Drive industrial estate in 1938, while the chapel survived until 1952.
&quot;The Osmaston Triangle&quot; is the part of Osmaston bounded by a railway line, Osmaston Road and Osmaston Park Road, with the two roads joining at the &quot;Spider Bridge&quot; in Allenton. In 2003, a major project called the &#x27;Osmaston Housing Improvement Zone&#x27; was approved to improve local housing conditions. This work included much of the area&#x27;s older, privately owned terraced houses, with 20 empty properties brought back into use and 93 low-income families helped with essential repairs. 
An arson incident occurred on Victory Road on 11 May 2012, which led to the deaths of six children.

In 1901 the civil parish had a population of 2453. On 1 April 1902 the parish was abolished and merged with Sinfin Moor. It is now in the unparished area of Derby, in the Derby district.

===Rolls-Royce===
From 1908 till 2007, Osmaston was the central location of the manufacturing unit of Rolls-Royce until this facility was moved 2 km south to Sinfin. The Nightingale Road &quot;Main Works&quot; site opened in 1908 to manufacture the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. The rear of the site had a test track called &quot;Miniature Brooklands,&quot; which was used to prove the cars.

During World War II, on Monday, 27 July 1942, at 7.50 am, a lone Dornier Do 217 attacked the Rolls-Royce factory in the area, making Merlin Engines vital to the war effort. The aircraft, at a very low level, hit the central stores and the houses opposite with four bombs, three 550kg and one 250 kg. The plane then strafed civilians in the Osmaston area and shot down a barrage balloon before returning to base. Twenty-three people were killed, 12 in the works with the remainder in neighbouring houses in Hawthorn, Abingdon and Handel Street. Among those killed was Arthur Bacon, a former Derby County football player. A further 120 people were injured.

On 27 July 2017, a memorial to those who died was unveiled behind the Marble Hall. Guest of honour was Sheila Dixon, who was nine years old when one of the bombs impacted two doors down from her home, killing her friend Dennis Regan.

In April 2009, Derby City Council agreed to buy the old Rolls-Royce site in a move towards the ongoing regeneration of Osmaston.

==Education==
Schools serving the Osmaston area are Nightingale Infant and Primary schools, which both have &quot;Inadequate&quot; Ofsted reports.

==Religious sites==
Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish Church serves the area. The church was built in 1926 on land given by Mrs Walter Evans and was extended in 1966 to give a new Chancel, Lady Chapel and Vestries.

==Osmaston Park==
At the southern edge of Osmaston is a public park called Osmaston Park. It is 650 metres long by 250 metres wide with a patched perimeter of 1,500 metres. It has two grassed areas set aside as football pitches on either side of a central wooded circle called &quot;Ash Wood,&quot; with an adventure playground. The park features basketball courts, a community centre and a BMX track.

<text>Joseph Campbell (15 July 1879 – 6 June 1944) was an Irish poet and lyricist. He wrote under the Irish form of his name Seosamh Mac Cathmhaoil (also Seosamh MacCathmhaoil) Campbell being a common anglicization of the old Irish name MacCathmhaoil. He is now remembered best for words he supplied to traditional airs, such as &quot;My Lagan Love&quot; and &quot;Gartan Mother&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;; his verse was also set to music by Arnold Bax and Ivor Gurney.

==Life==
He was born in Belfast, into a Catholic and Irish nationalist family from County Down. He was educated at St Malachy&#x27;s College, Belfast. After working for his father he taught for a while. He travelled to Dublin in 1902, meeting leading nationalist figures. His literary activities began with songs, as a collector in Antrim and working with the composer Herbert Hughes. He was then a founder of the Ulster Literary Theatre in 1904. He contributed a play, &quot;The Little Cowherd of Slainge&quot;, and several articles to its journal &quot;Uladh&quot; edited by Bulmer Hobson. &quot;The Little Cowherd of Slainge&quot; was performed by the ULT at the Clarence Place Hall in Belfast on 4 May 1905, along with Lewis Purcell&#x27;s &quot;The Enthusiast&quot;.

He moved to Dublin in 1905, failed to find work and the following year (1906) he moved to London where he was involved in Irish literary activities while working as a teacher. He married in 1910 Nancy Maude, and they moved shortly to Dublin, and then County Wicklow. His play &quot;Judgement&quot; was performed at the Abbey Theatre in April 1912.

He took part as a supporter in the Easter Rising of 1916, doing rescue work. The following year he published a translation from Irish of the short stories of Patrick Pearse, one of the leaders of the Rising.

He became a Sinn Féin Councillor in Wicklow in 1921. Later in the Irish Civil War he was on the Republican side, and was interned in 1922/3. His marriage broke up, and he emigrated to the United States in 1925. There he lived in New York City. He lectured at Fordham University, and worked in academic Irish studies, founding the university&#x27;s School of Irish Studies in 1928, which lasted four years.
He was the editor of &quot;The Irish Review&quot;, a short lived (April, May and July 1934) &quot;magazine of Irish expression&quot;. Business manager was George G. Lennon, former Officer Commanding of the County Waterford Flying Column during the Irish War of Independence. Managing editor was Lennon&#x27;s brother in law, George H. Sherwood. Campbell returned to Ireland in 1939, settling at Glencree, County Wicklow, and dying at Lacken Daragh, Enniskerry on 6 June 1944.

<doc id="1105264" wikidata="Q262555" url="?curid=1105264" title="Hermann's tortoise">
<text>The hermann&#x27;s tortoise (&quot;Testudo hermanni)&quot; is a species of tortoise native to Europe.

==Etymology==
The specific epithet, &quot;hermanni&quot;, honors French naturalist Johann Hermann.

The subspecific name, &quot;boettgeri&quot;, honors German herpetologist Oskar Boettger.

==Taxonomy==
Two subspecies are known: the western Hermann&#x27;s tortoise (&quot;T. h. hermanni)&quot; and the eastern Hermann&#x27;s tortoise (&quot;T. h. boettgeri)&quot;. Sometimes mentioned as a subspecies, &quot;T. h. peleponnesica&quot; is not yet confirmed to be genetically different from &quot;T. h. boettgeri&quot;.

In 2006, Hermann&#x27;s tortoise was suggested to be moved to the genus &quot;Eurotestudo&quot; and to bring the subspecies to the rank of species (Eurotestudo hermanni and &quot;Eurotestudo boettgeri)&quot;. Although some factors indicate this might be correct, the data at hand are not unequivocally in support and the relationships between Hermann&#x27;s and the Russian tortoise among each other and to the other species placed in &quot;Testudo&quot; are not robustly determined. Hence, it seems doubtful that the new genus will be accepted for now. The elevation of the subspecies to full species was tentatively rejected under the biological species concept at least, as there still seems significant gene flow.

Of note, the rate of evolution as measured by mutations accumulating in the mtDNA differs markedly, with the eastern populations having evolved faster. This is apparently due to stronger fragmentation of the population on the mountainous Balkans during the last ice age. While this has no profound implications for taxonomy of this species, apart from suggesting that two other proposed subspecies are actually just local forms at present, it renders the use of molecular clocks in &quot;Testudo&quot; even more dubious and unreliable than they are for tortoises in general.

===&quot;T. h. hermanni&quot;===
The subspecies &quot;T. h. hermanni&quot; includes the former subspecies &quot;T. h. robertmertensi&quot; and has a number of local forms. It has a highly arched shell with an intensive coloration, with its yellow coloration making a strong contrast to the dark patches. The colors wash out somewhat in older animals, but the intense yellow is often maintained. The underside has two connected black bands along the central seam.

The coloration of the head ranges from dark green to yellowish, with isolated dark patches. A particular characteristic is a yellow fleck on the cheek found in most specimens, although not in all; &quot;T. h. robertmertensi&quot; is the name of a morph with very prominent cheek spots. Generally, the forelegs have no black pigmentation on their undersides. The base of the claws is often lightly colored. The tail in males is larger than in females and possesses a spike. Generally, the shell protecting the tail is divided. A few specimens can be found with undivided shells, similar to the Greek tortoise.
===&quot;T. h. boettgeri&quot;===
The subspecies &quot;T. h. hercegovinensis&quot;, known as the Dalmatian tortoise, (Balkans coast) and the local &quot;T. h. peloponnesica&quot; (southwestern Peloponnesus coast) are now included here; they constitute local forms that are not yet geographically or in other ways reproductively isolated and apparently, derive from relict populations of the last ice age. The eastern Hermann&#x27;s tortoises also have arched, almost round carapaces, but some are notably flatter and more oblong. The coloration is brownish with a yellow or greenish hue and with isolated black flecks. The coloring tends to wash out quite strongly in older animals. The underside is almost always solid horn color and has separate black patches on either side of the central seam.

The head is brown to black, with fine scales. The forelegs similarly possess fine scales. The limbs generally have five claws, which are darkly colored at their base. The hind legs are noticeably thicker than the forelegs, almost plump. The particularly strong tail ends in a spike, which may be very large in older male specimens. Females have noticeably smaller tail spikes, which are slightly bent toward the body. They can vary in size, but do not grow a huge amount. Their age can be around 70–80 years.

==Geographic range==
&quot;Testudo hermanni&quot; can be found throughout southern Europe. The western population (&quot;T. h. hermanni&quot;) is found in eastern Spain, southern France, the Balearic islands, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, southern and central Italy (Tuscany). The eastern population (&quot;T. h. boettgeri&quot; ) is found in Serbia, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Turkey and Greece, while &quot;T. h. hercegovinensis&quot; populates the coasts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Montenegro.

The oldest known evidence for &quot;T. hermanni&quot; on Sardinia is a fossil from the early Pleistocene of Monte Tuttavista. However, molecular evidence suggests extant populations of both this species and &quot;Emys orbicularis&quot; on Sardinia were actually introduced in recent times. Hermann&#x27;s tortoise was similarly introduced to Cyprus.

==Description==
Hermann&#x27;s tortoises are small to medium-sized tortoises from southern Europe. Young animals and some adults have attractive black and yellow-patterned carapaces, although the brightness may fade with age to a less distinct gray, straw, or yellow coloration. They have slightly hooked upper jaws and, like other tortoises, possess no teeth, just strong, horny beaks. Their scaly limbs are greyish to brown, with some yellow markings, and their tails bear a spur (a horny spike) at the tip. Adult males have particularly long and thick tails, and well-developed spurs, distinguishing them from females.

The eastern subspecies &quot;T. h. boettgeri&quot; is much larger than the western &quot;T. h. hermanni&quot;, reaching sizes up to in length. A specimen of this size may weigh . &quot;T. h. hermanni&quot; rarely grows larger than . Some adult specimens are as small as .

== Ecology ==
Early in the morning, the animals leave their nightly shelters, which are usually hollows protected by thick bushes or hedges, to bask in the sun and warm their bodies. They then roam about the Mediterranean meadows of their habitat in search of food. They determine which plants to eat by the sense of smell. In captivity, they eat a variety of wildflowers, however care must be taken regarding which are made available, as some flowers such as buttercups are toxic to them. Certain plants such as dandelion and kale are high in oxalic acid, which can build up over time causing renal failure, it is therefore important to carefully monitor their diet and give a varied selection of wildflower leaves. All pre-prepared food pellets are bad for Hermann&#x27;s tortoises, proving addictive, often resulting in unnatural growth rates and the refusal to eat natural foods. Certain foods may prove toxic despite the tortoises enjoyment of them, including legumes, tomatoes and cabbage. The animals eat small amounts of fruits as supplementary nutrition, however this should only be given occasionally.

Around midday, the sun becomes too hot for the tortoises, so they return to their hiding places. They have a good sense of direction to enable them to return. In the late afternoon, they leave their shelters again and return to feeding.

In late February, Hermann&#x27;s tortoises emerge from under bushes or old rotting wood, where they spend the winter months hibernating, buried in a bed of dead leaves. Immediately after surfacing from their winter resting place, Hermann&#x27;s tortoises commence courtship and mating. Courtship is a rough affair for the female, which is pursued, rammed, and bitten by the male, before being mounted. Aggression is also seen between rival males during the breeding season, which can result in ramming contests.

Between May and July, female Hermann&#x27;s tortoises deposit between two and 12 eggs into flask-shaped nests dug into the soil, up to deep. Most females lay more than one clutch each season. The pinkish-white eggs are incubated for around 90 days and, like many reptiles, the temperature at which the eggs are incubated determines the hatchlings sex. At 26 °C, only males will be produced, while at 30 °C, all the hatchlings will be female. Young Hermann&#x27;s tortoises emerge just after the start of the heavy autumn rains in early September and spend the first four or five years of their lives within just a few metres of their nests. If the rains do not come, or if nesting took place late in the year, the eggs will still hatch, but the young will remain underground and not emerge until the following spring. Until the age of six or eight, when the hard shell becomes fully developed, the young tortoises are very vulnerable to predators and may fall prey to rats, badgers, magpies, foxes, wild boar, and many other animals. If they survive these threats, the longevity of Hermann&#x27;s tortoises is around 30 years. One rare record of longevity is 31.7 years. Compared to other tortoises (e.g. &quot;Testudo graeca&quot;), the longevity might be underestimated and many sources are reporting they might live 90 years or more.

===Hibernation===
In nature, Hermann’s tortoises dig their nightly shelters out and spend the relatively mild Mediterranean winters there. During this time, their heart and breathing rates drop notably. Captive bred animals can be kept in the basement in a roomy rodent-proof box with a thick layer of dry leaves. The temperature should be around 5 °C. As an alternative, the box can be stored in a refrigerator. For this method to be used, the refrigerator should be in regular day-to-day use, to permit air flow. During hibernation, the ambient temperature must not fall below zero. Full-grown specimens may sleep four to five months at a time.

== In captivity ==
Hermann&#x27;s tortoise can be kept indoors with adequate living conditions provided by the owner. It requires a heat lamp set at around to provide a basking area. A UVB bulb is also needed to help process and create vitamin D3 and prevents issues such as metabolic bone disease.

==Conservation==
The species is included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international export/import requires CITES documentation to be obtained and presented to border authorities.

Many ways have been introduced to help conserve the species&quot;.&quot; A program introduced in 1989 and 1990 reintroduced tortoises to the population, put fences to reduce highway traffic towards the tortoises and more. This was shown to aid in increasing population numbers by reintroducing other tortoises of the same species.

<text>The Sharma speaker was a rotary speaker, similar in design to the Leslie speaker, that was manufactured in the UK by Keith Hitchcock during the 1960s and 1970s.

==History==
The name &quot;Sharma&quot; came from Hitchcock&#x27;s two children, Sharon and Mark.

Hitchcock designed the speaker to directly compete with the Leslie, and consequently it contains similar features, such as a rotating horn for treble frequencies, a drum for bass frequencies, and the same nine-pin amphenol connector interface as contemporary Leslies then in production. However, unlike a typical Leslie, it includes a treble and bass control, and a line level input. 

Also, in the Leslie units the horn and bass rotor moved in opposite directions, with a fast and slow motor on each. In the Sharma units, they both rotate in the same direction, with just a fast and slow motor shared. A clutch allows the top and bottom rotors to accelerate at different rates. 

The amplifier boards were made for Sharma by HH Electronics. 
Some of the early Sharma speakers had an eight-pin connector. Some models of speaker also contained rotary and stationary speakers, with separate power amplifiers, which were used on non-Hammond organs such as Lowrey or Wurlitzer.

Sharma speakers fell out of favour due to the introduction of low-cost electronics that could emulate the rotating speaker sound.

Founded in 1670 as a physic garden to grow medicinal plants, today it occupies four sites across Scotland—Edinburgh, Dawyck, Logan and Benmore—each with its own specialist collection. The RBGE&#x27;s living collection consists of more than 13,302 plant species (34,422 accessions), whilst the herbarium contains in excess of 3 million preserved specimens.

The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is an executive non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government. The Edinburgh site is the main garden and the headquarters of the public body, which is led by Regius Keeper Simon Milne.

==History==
The Edinburgh botanic garden was founded in 1670 at St. Anne&#x27;s Yard, near Holyrood Palace, by Robert Sibbald and Andrew Balfour. It is the second oldest botanic garden in the UK after Oxford&#x27;s. The plant collection used as the basis of the garden was the private collection of Sir Patrick Murray, 2nd Lord Elibank, moved from his home at Livingston Peel in 1672 following his death in September 1671. The original site was &quot;obtained of John Brown, gardener of the North Yardes in the Holyrood Abby, an inclosure of some 40 foot of measure every way. By what we procured from Levingstone and other gardens, we made a collection of eight or nine hundred plants yr.&quot; This site proved too small, and in 1676 grounds belonging to Trinity Hospital were leased by Balfour from the City Council: this second garden was sited just to the east of the Nor Loch, down from the High Street.

In the spring of 1689, for certain strategic military reasons, the Nor Loch which lay west of the Physic Garden was drained, resulting in the flooding of the garden (which at this stage had wholly relocated to the Trinity Hospital site), with much mud and general rubbish being deposited, to the ruination of many of the plants. Partly for this reason and partly due to necessary expansion the facility relocated to the Holyrood site in 1695.

John Ainslie&#x27;s 1804 map shows it as the &quot;Old Physick Garden&quot; to the east of the North Bridge. The site was subsequently occupied by tracks of the North British Railway, and a plaque at platform 11 of the Waverley railway station marks its location.

In 1763, the garden&#x27;s collections were moved away from the city&#x27;s pollution to a larger (five acre) &quot;Physick Garden&quot; on the west side of Leith Walk, covering the area now called Bellevue, all under the control of Prof John Hope. This site is shown in Ainslie&#x27;s 1804 map. The site is today known as Hopetoun Crescent Gardens and is one of the collection of New Town Gardens.

Some time prior to Hope&#x27;s death (1786) he was brought Turkish rhubarb seeds by Bruce of Kinnaird and this was the first rhubarb grown in Great Britain. As this proved successful over 3000 plants were grown as rhubarb was previously an expensive import (used as a medicine).

A cottage from the garden&#x27;s original site remained on Leith Walk for over one hundred years. In 2008, the building was moved brick by brick to a site within the current gardens. The project was completed in 2016. The garden was a popular destination for botanists and supplied plants to other gardens such as Kew. Hope erected a monument to Carl Linnaeus on the site in 1778.

In the early 1820s under the direction of the Curator, William McNab, the garden moved west to its present location (adjacent to Inverleith Row), and the Leith Walk site was built over between Hopetoun Crescent and Haddington Place. The Temperate Palm House, which remains the tallest in Scotland, was built in 1858.

In 1877, the city acquired Inverleith House from the estate of Cosmo Innes and added it to the existing gardens, opening the remodelled grounds to the public in 1881.

The botanic garden at Benmore became the first Regional Garden of the RBGE in 1929. It was followed by the gardens at Logan and Dawyck in 1969 and 1978.

At present: The RBGE is creating a digital record of its renowned Herbarium collection of over three million preserved plant specimens from 157 countries. Historically hard to access, it is now being digitised into high-resolution images that can be viewed by anyone with an internet connection. The digitised platform now sees requests come in from across the globe from students, scientists and plant enthusiasts.

The one millionth specimen to be digitised was Stereocaulon vesuvianum, a species of lichen collected from Ben Nevis in 2021.

RBGE lichenologist Dr Rebecca Yahr, who collected the specimen during a climb up Scotland&#x27;s tallest mountain, said: &quot;Celebrating the milestone with this important specimen is an exciting opportunity for us to highlight Scotland&#x27;s unique biodiversity and extend RBGE&#x27;s mission to research and understand lichens more generally.&quot;

==The garden at Edinburgh==

The Botanic Garden&#x27;s main site in Edinburgh is a hugely important player in a worldwide network of institutions seeking to ensure that biodiversity is not further eroded. Located one mile from the city centre it covers .

The RBGE is actively involved in, and coordinates numerous in situ and ex situ conservation projects both in the UK and internationally. The three main cross-cutting themes of scientific work at the RBGE are: Scottish Biodiversity, Plants &amp; Climate Change, and Conservation.

In addition to the RBGE&#x27;s scientific activities the garden remains a popular destination for both tourists and locals. Locally known as &quot;The Botanics&quot;, the garden is a popular place to go for a walk, particularly with young families. Entrance to the botanic garden is free, although a small entry charge exists for the glasshouses. During the year the garden hosts many events including live performances, guided tours and exhibitions. The RBGE is also an important centre for education, offering taught courses across all levels.

In 2009, the John Hope Gateway was opened. John Hope was the first Regius Keeper of RBGE.

===Living collection===
Nearly 273,000 individual plants are grown at the Botanics in Edinburgh or its three smaller satellite gardens (known as Regional Gardens) located in other parts of Scotland. These represent around 13,300 species from all over the world, or about 4% of all known plant species.

The RBGE Living Collection catalogue is available here and updated nightly.

Some notable collections at the botanic garden Edinburgh include:
*Alpine Plants
*Chinese Hillside
*Cryptogamic Garden

===Herbarium===
The RBGE herbarium (situated in a purpose-built facility at the Edinburgh site) is considered a world-leading botanical collection, housing in excess of 3 million specimens. Prior to the formation of the Herbarium, plant collections tended to be the private property of the Regius Keeper. The Herbarium in its present form came with the fusion of the collections of the University of Edinburgh and the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1839–40. RBGE&#x27;s Herbarium moved into its present, purpose-built home in 1964.

Over the years, a large number of collections have been added, belonging to individuals such as R.K. Greville and John Hutton Balfour, and institutions including the Universities of Glasgow, St Andrews and Hull. The most important historical collection is that of George Walker Arnott, which came with the University of Glasgow&#x27;s foreign herbarium deposited on permanent loan in 1965. This collection contains specimens from all the major mid-19th century collectors, especially from India, North and South America, and South Africa, including type material of species described by &#x27;Hooker &amp; Arnott&#x27;. From the early 20th century, collections have been made by members of staff.

Approx a third of the herbarium is in a searchable database. The &quot;Index Herbariorum&quot; code assigned to the RBGE herbarium is E and it is used when citing housed specimens.

===Library===
RBGE&#x27;s Library is Scotland&#x27;s national reference collection for specialist botanical and horticultural resources. Housing around 70,000 books and 150,000 periodicals, the research library is one of the country&#x27;s largest. It has been built up to support the specific subject fields researched and taught at RBGE. Garden staff and students are its main users, along with visiting researchers. However, as a national reference collection, the Library is also open to members of the public, either in person or by telephone or e-mail.

===Inverleith House===
Inverleith House is an 18th-century building, located centrally in the modern botanic gardens. From 1960 to 1984 it was the original base of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, with exhibits in the house and in the gardens, before it moved to larger premises in Belford Road. Since then, Inverleith House has functioned as a contemporary art gallery, showing a programme of temporary exhibitions by invited artists. Its spring programmes feature works and specimens from the historical collections of the Botanics, together with exhibitions by modern and contemporary artists. The gallery is curated by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

==Regional specialist gardens==
===Benmore===

Situated on the West Coast of Scotland, Benmore Botanic Garden experiences a wetter and milder oceanic climate than the main site in Edinburgh. Benmore grows trees and shrubs from high rainfall areas, especially conifers and rhododendrons. Highlights of the collection include an avenue of Sequoiadendron and a recently refurbished Fernery, exhibiting rare ferns from both Britain and abroad.

===Dawyck===
Situated to the south of the Scottish Border town of Peebles, Dawyck Botanic Garden is particularly suitable for hardy plants from the world&#x27;s cooler, drier areas. Dawyck is also renowned for its high diversity of fungi and cryptogamics.

===Logan===
Logan, Scotland&#x27;s most exotic garden, has an almost sub-tropical climate, and provides ideal growing conditions for southern hemisphere plants.

==Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Medal==

The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Medal, instituted in 2010, is awarded from time to time to recognise an outstanding individual contribution in any field related to the work of the RBGE (either by a member of staff or by any other person). The medal, struck in silver, has a sibbaldia motif on one face and a portrait of Robert Sibbald on the other.

<text>Bruno Langley (born 21 March 1983) is an English musician and former actor. He is known for his roles as Todd Grimshaw in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (2001–2004, 2007, 2011, 2013–2017) and Adam Mitchell in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2005).

In October 2017, a spokesman for the show confirmed that Langley&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot; contract had been terminated. Greater Manchester Police later announced he had been charged with two counts of sexual assault, to both of which he pleaded guilty on 28 November 2017; he was sentenced to a 12-month community order.

In 2021, Langley announced his intention to pursue his musical aspirations by releasing his first recordings.

==Early life==
Langley was born to Australian parents in Somerset and grew up in Buxton, Derbyshire. He attended Harpur Hill Primary School and Buxton Community School. He trained at the North Cheshire Theatre School in Heaton Moor. Along with his sisters he was a member of a number of junior string orchestras in which he played cello.

==Career==
===Film and television===
From 2001 to 2004, Langley played the character of Todd Grimshaw in the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. As the first openly gay character on the show, Langley developed a large gay following.

He had also appeared in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on 4 August 2000 as Darren Michaels, then boyfriend of Candice. He also had a semi-regular role from 2001 to 2002 in &quot;Linda Green&quot; as Philip &quot;Fizz&quot; Green, the eponymous character&#x27;s younger brother.

While on leave from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, he has played roles such as the part of Adam Mitchell in the 2005 series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; appearing in two episodes, &quot;Dalek&quot; and &quot;The Long Game&quot;, and provided an audio commentary for the DVD of these episodes. He also filmed a small role in the feature film &quot;The League of Gentlemen&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot;, released in June 2005, as well an episode of &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; and the little-seen film &quot;Halal Harry&quot; in 2006, and read &quot;Horace&quot; for BBC Radio 7.

He returned to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for a twelve episode guest stint in 2007. In April 2011 Langley returned to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for a one episode appearance. In June 2013 it was announced that Langley was returning to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as a regular character and his character returned in the episodes screened on 4 November. However, following his sexual assault charges, Langley&#x27;s contract with &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was terminated in October 2017.

===Theatre===

In the summer of 2005, Langley made his stage debut in an acclaimed run of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; opposite fellow ex-soap actress Scarlett Alice Johnson at Stafford Castle. Taking on the role of Romeo, &quot;The British Theatre Guide&quot; described Langley as, &#x27;immediately comfortable with the verse, finding no difficulty in being the lovesick youngster before he&#x27;s gripped with passion for Juliet. Later he convincingly shows a tantrum-like immaturity at his banishment.&#x27;

On 30 October 2005, he appeared on stage at the Old Vic in London in the one-night-only play &quot;Night Sky&quot; with Christopher Eccleston, Navin Chowdhry, David Warner, Saffron Burrows and David Baddiel.

In the spring of 2006, Langley appeared in &quot;Life Imitates Art&quot; at the Camden People&#x27;s Theatre, Camden. Also in 2006 he was seen in a production of &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, taking on the role of repressed gay art student, Geoffrey. In his role as Geoffrey, Langley was described as, &#x27;quietly impressive, poignantly conveying Geoffrey&#x27;s unending loyalty with ease.&#x27; The production toured the UK extensively and played a short run at the Richmond Theatre.

Beginning in May 2008, he appeared in the premiere stage run of the new musical &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; starring opposite fellow &quot;Coronation Street&quot; alumna Lucy Evans at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin.

Langley also appeared in the stage show &quot;Flashdance the Musical&quot; with Victoria Hamilton-Barritt, Bernie Nolan and Noel Sullivan. Langley received positive reviews for his role as Jimmy Kaminsky, with &quot;What&#x27;s on Stage&quot; stating, &#x27;Bruno Langley also fares well as Jimmy, particularly when he has the chance to showcase his fine voice in the second act.&#x27; and Lindsay Corr stating in the &quot;Edinburgh Guide&quot; that, &#x27;Bruno Langley as Jimmy shows acting doesn&#x27;t have to take a back seat in musical theatre, as he twitches about the stage in his grey hoodie and delivers his number, &#x27;You Can&#x27;t Keep Me Down&#x27;, with understated aplomb.&#x27;

In 2010–2011 he joined the tour of &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;, in the role of the young photographer, Lawrence. In reviewing the Liverpool Empire Theatre production of the show, &quot;Liverpool Sound and Vision&quot; said Langley, &#x27;gave outstanding moments of beautiful comic timing as young photographer Lawrence that it&#x27;s no wonder he was asked back to reprise his role from last year.&#x27;

In November 2012 he began playing Giles Ralston in the 60th anniversary tour of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; by Agatha Christie.

===Music===

Langley played the cello until the age of 16, when he decided to pursue a career as an actor. In addition, he plays the piano. In 2010, he formed a band, Bruno Langley and the Wonderland Band. In a 2011 interview with Dianne Bourne of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, he stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve been acting on and off ever since the age of 17, but always in between jobs I&#x27;d sit at the piano and write songs, and sing different songs. A year and a half ago I got a band together, we had a few rehearsals, I had fun doing it and it&#x27;s gone from there really.&quot; The band performs songs from the 1950s, as well as taking modern tracks and arranging them into jazz, blues and swing styles. Langley has stated that he does the arrangements himself.

As a musician, Langley performed at Manchester Pride in 2011. He released an EP called &quot;Jump&quot; in July 2016. Langley re-launched his music career in October 2020, when he released a single, &quot;Collide&quot;. He released another single in June 2021, titled &quot;Downpour&quot;.

====Extended Plays====
===Singles===
===Audio dramas===

Following his role as Adam Mitchell in the 2005 season of BBC&#x27;s Doctor Who, Langley reprised his role for a single audio drama developed by Big Finish Productions in 2017. Following his sexual assault allegations he was not invited to return for later stories.

===Photography===

Langley responded to tabloid reports in August 2019 by confirming on Twitter that he had been working as a portrait photographer.

==Personal life==
Langley was in a relationship with Victoria Roscoe, a beautician, from 2004 until 2012. Roscoe gave birth to their son, Freddie, in May 2007. In November 2013, Langley revealed he and Roscoe had ended their relationship, but were sharing the upbringing of their son.

Langley met Lucy France in 2019; the couple married and had a child in 2023.

===Conviction===
In October 2017, a woman complained to ITV that Langley had harassed and sexually assaulted her at Band on the Wall, a Manchester music venue. After an internal investigation into the woman&#x27;s allegations, Langley&#x27;s contract with &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was terminated with immediate effect. His character continued to appear on screen until December 2017. On 30 October 2017, police confirmed that Langley had been charged with two counts of sexual assault. Langley appeared in court on 28 November 2017 and pleaded guilty to the charges. His drunkenness on the night was considered as an aggravating factor by District Judge Mark Hadfield, who sentenced Langley to a twelve-month community order and 40 days of rehabilitation activity. Langley was also ordered to observe a curfew, wear an electronic tag, pay £250 compensation to his victims and sign onto the sex offender register for five years.

<doc id="1105276" wikidata="Q1535422" url="?curid=1105276" title="Tono-Bungay">
<text>Tono-Bungay is a realist semiautobiographical novel written by H. G. Wells and first published in book form in 1909. It has been called &quot;arguably his most artistic book&quot;. It had been serialised before book publication, both in the United States, in &quot;The Popular Magazine&quot;, beginning in the issue of September 1908, and in Britain, in &quot;The English Review&quot;, beginning in the magazine&#x27;s first issue in December 1908.

==Plot==
&quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; is narrated by George Ponderevo, who is persuaded to help develop the business of selling Tono-Bungay, a patent medicine created by his uncle Edward. George devotes seven years to organising the production and manufacture of the product, even though he believes it is &quot;a damned swindle&quot;. He then quits day-to-day involvement with the enterprise in favour of aeronautics, but he remains associated with his uncle, who becomes a financier of the first water and is on the verge of achieving social as well as economic dominance when his business empire collapses. George tries to rescue his uncle&#x27;s failing finances by stealing quantities of a radioactive compound called &quot;quap&quot; from an island off the coast of West Africa, but the expedition is unsuccessful. George then engineers his uncle&#x27;s escape from England in an experimental aircraft he has built, but the ruined entrepreneur turned financier catches pneumonia on the flight and dies in a village near Bordeaux, despite George&#x27;s efforts to save him. The novel ends with George finding a new occupation: designing destroyers for the highest bidder.

==Themes==

===Scepticism about religion===
George&#x27;s resolve to struggle against &quot;the whole scheme of revealed religion&quot; is strengthened by his experience with his evangelical cousin at Chatham, Nicodemus Frapp, a baker to whom he is briefly &quot;a fully indentured apprentice&quot;.

===Socialism===
George is influenced by Bob Ewart, a childhood friend and the son of an artist who becomes an artist himself, struggling against a system in which &quot;[n]obody wants to do and be the things people are&quot;. It is Ewart who first interests George in socialism, but Ewart&#x27;s socialism is detached, cynical and merely &quot;discursive&quot;. (Here Wells was probably satirising the Fabian Society, which Wells had tried and failed to reorient between 1903 and 1906.) Ewart is important to George in that he &quot;kept my fundamental absurdity illuminated for me during all this astonishing time [of working for the success of Tono-Bungay].&quot;

===Ennui===
George struggles with ennui after breaking with Marion: &quot;I suffered, I suppose, from a sort of ennui of the imagination. I found myself without an object to hold my will together. I sought. I read restlessly and discursively. . . . it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims I discovered myself for the first time. Before that I had seen only the world and things in it, had sought them self-forgetful of all but my impulse. Now I found myself GROUPED with a system of appetites and satisfactions, with much work to do – and no desire, it seemed, left in me. There were moments when I thought of suicide&quot;. George only partially resolves this moral crisis by, as he says, &quot;idealis[ing] Science&quot;.

===English society===
The protagonist of the novel is George Ponderevo, whose most intimate life the reader shares. His uncle Edward, on the other hand, remains a somewhat flat character whose chief function is to symbolise the &quot;wasting aimless fever of trade and money-making and pleasure-seeking&quot; that became, in Wells&#x27;s view, the most important social force in late-Victorian and Edwardian England. England is interpreted in the novel as a &quot;social organism&quot;. The country estate of Bladesover, &quot;up on the Kentish Downs,&quot; epitomises a &quot;seventeenth-century system&quot; which offers &quot;the clue to all England. . . . There have been no revolutions, no deliberate restatements or abandonments of opinion in England since the days of the fine gentry, since 1688 or thereabouts, the days when Bladesover was built; there have been changes, dissolving forces, replacing forces, if you will; but then it was that the broad lines of the English system set firmly. . . . The fine gentry may have gone; they have indeed largely gone, I think; rich merchants may have replaced them, financial adventurers or what not. That does not matter; the shape is still Bladesover&quot;. Bladesover was based on Uppark, on the South Downs, where Wells mother worked.

This society has fallen prey to shabby forces of greed and acquisition that are embodied by Edward Ponderevo, who idealises Napoleon and who muses superficially about &quot;[t]his Overman idee, Nietzsche—all that stuff.&quot; The trashy emptiness of Edward&#x27;s ideal of life is expressed in his absurd attempt to build a vast mansion at Crest Hill. The character may have been based on the fraudster Whitaker Wright.

As a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; also explores the development of the narrator&#x27;s emotional life. Three sexual relationships are analysed: his unsuccessful marriage to Marion; his affair with the liberated Effie; and his doomed relationship with Beatrice Normandy, a &quot;belle dame sans merci&quot; whom he has known since childhood and who loves but refuses to marry him. George also tells of his frustrated love for his stern, austere mother, who was a domestic servant, and his powerful attachment to his aunt Susan, a character whose depiction may be, in part, a portrait of Wells&#x27;s second wife, Amy Catherine Robbins (better known as Jane).

===Metaphysics===
So powerful have corrupting social forces become that they overcome and denature George&#x27;s life, for while in his youth he was capable of virtue, love and creativity, he finds no ideal he can devote himself to. Instead he becomes the fabricator of powerful machines whose destructive potential can only be guessed at. The concluding chapter, &quot;Night and the Open Sea&quot;, depicts a test run of the &quot;X2&quot;, a destroyer that George has designed and built. The vessel becomes a symbol of a metaphysical &quot;something&quot; that &quot;drives&quot;, that &quot;is at once human achievement and the most inhuman of all existing things&quot;.

==Reception and criticism==
Initial reviews were mixed. The novel was criticised by Hubert Bland and Robertson Nicoll, but the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; praised it as &quot;a masterpiece&quot;. Gilbert Murray praised the book in three separate letters to the author, comparing Wells to Leo Tolstoy. Biographer Vincent Brome has written that &quot;&quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; came fresh and vivid to men and women of Wells&#x27;s generation. These great questionings, the challenge to one eternal verity after another, shook their world and their way of life, and it was all tremendously exciting&quot;.

Wells himself was &quot;disposed to regard &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; as the finest and most finished novel upon the accepted lines&quot; that he had &quot;written or was ever likely to write&quot;.

In the view of one of Wells&#x27;s biographers, David C. Smith, &quot;Kipps&quot;, &quot;The History of Mr Polly&quot; and &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; together make it possible for Wells &quot;to claim a permanent place in English fiction, close to Dickens because of the extraordinary humanity of some of his characters, but also because of his ability to invoke a &quot;place&quot;, a &quot;class&quot;, a &quot;social scene&quot;. These novels are very personal as well, treating aspects of Wells&#x27;s own life, matters which would come under attack later, but only after he added his sexual and extramarital views to the personal side of his work.&quot;

The book was praised by H. L. Mencken in &quot;Prejudices, First Series&quot;.

The film stars Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Cameron Bright, Danny Huston, Arliss Howard, Peter Stormare, Ted Levine, and Anne Heche. Its plot follows a woman who becomes convinced that her deceased husband Sean is reincarnated as a ten-year-old boy.

Distributed by New Line Cinema, &quot;Birth&quot; premiered in competition at the 61st Venice International Film Festival, polarizing critics upon its release and grossing $23.9 million on a budget of $20 million. Kidman was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance. The film has been re-evaluated in later years and is considered a masterpiece by some publications.

==Plot==
Sean and Anna are a married couple living in New York City. At the beginning of the film, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. Afterwards, Sean goes jogging, collapses, and dies.

Ten years later, Anna accepts a marriage proposal from her new fiancé, Joseph. When Clifford, Sean&#x27;s brother, arrives at Anna&#x27;s engagement party, his wife Clara excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap a gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the original gift while a young boy secretly looks on.

Sometime later, at a party for Anna&#x27;s mother, the boy sneaks into the apartment and claims to be Sean. At first, Anna dismisses the boy&#x27;s claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day, warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband.

That night, Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy and that his name is Sean, Joseph calls to obtain more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean&#x27;s father and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father&#x27;s arms.

Sean leaves a message on Anna&#x27;s answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna&#x27;s mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park and that she will know where exactly. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning.

Anna&#x27;s brother-in-law Bob, a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. Sean answers all the questions, even providing intimate details of Anna and Sean&#x27;s sex life. Sean is brought to Anna&#x27;s by his mother and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna&#x27;s family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura, who treats Sean with contempt.

When Anna misses an appointment with her fiancé to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried, not merely about the boy but Anna&#x27;s odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and Sean kisses her on the lips.

Anna seems convinced by the boy&#x27;s story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When Sean visits her, he brings a backpack full of Anna&#x27;s love letters to Sean. This package was Clara&#x27;s spiteful engagement gift, which the boy had secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. Clara had been Sean&#x27;s lover before his death, and he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara had been jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but at the last moment abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out to Sean that if he were really a reincarnation, he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused.

When Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that he cannot be the reincarnated Sean since he loves her. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean writes a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the ocean&#x27;s edge in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph finds her and leads her back, whispering into her ear.

==Production==
Director Jonathan Glazer was interested in making a film about &quot;the idea of eternal love&quot; and a &quot;mystery of the heart&quot;. While writing the script, he was not interested in making a ghost story or a &quot;paranormal piece&quot;. He envisioned a fairy tale structure early on. The initial idea for the film came to him one day when he was in his kitchen: &quot;There&#x27;s this little kid and he tells a woman he&#x27;s her dead husband – and he&#x27;s ten years old.&quot; Glazer went to Paris to discuss the idea with French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière at his producer&#x27;s recommendation. Carrière ended up helping Glazer with the story and acted as a script consultant. The director spent eight months going back and forth to Paris every weekend turning one paragraph into three acts. The script went through 21 drafts as Glazer and co-screenwriter Milo Addica worked on the story. With only a few weeks before principal photography was to begin, the two writers decided to refocus the entire film. Originally, the script was about the boy and they changed it to be about the woman instead. &quot;We aimed to make something robust in which every question leads to another,&quot; said Glazer. &quot;I&#x27;m not a Buddhist and I don&#x27;t believe in reincarnation; I don&#x27;t think I could do a film about it if I did. I was more interested in the idea of eternal love. I wanted to make a mystery, the mystery of the heart.&quot;

Actress Nicole Kidman read the screenplay and wanted to do the film when she found out that Glazer was directing, as she loved his previous film, &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;. She approached the director about doing the film. At first, he resisted because he felt that &quot;her celebrity is so everywhere that I thought it could only hurt the delicate nature of this character&quot;. However, he met with Kidman and realized that &quot;she was ready to inhabit the role&quot;. The more he talked to Kidman about her character, he would rewrite the script on weekends, tailoring it specifically for her. To show Anna in mourning both externally and internally, Glazer gave her short hair, spare wardrobe, and short, clipped speech. The director explained Anna&#x27;s appearance as &quot;somebody who had sort of let all glamor go and sexuality go&quot;. Kidman said that Glazer instructed her to do small, personal reactions. She found the character to be all-consuming so she could not separate herself from the role. To research for the role, Kidman spoke to two friends who had lost their fathers and they talked about how it still affected them years after.

Addica and Glazer often wrote scenes the day before they were shot, giving them to the actors on the actual day they were shooting.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Birth&quot; grossed $5.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $18.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $23.9 million. In the United States and Canada, the film opened at number 12 on its opening weekend, grossing $1.3 million from 550 theaters.

===Critical response===
&quot;Birth&quot; premiered at the 61st Venice International Film Festival where its first press screening was greeted with widely reported booing and catcalls. Glazer responded, &quot;People are a bit polarised by it, which is healthy&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 149 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A well-mounted production is undermined by a muddled, absurd storyline of questionable taste.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 51 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote, &quot;the script is hooey. &quot;Birth&quot; is ridiculous, and oddly unforgettable&quot;. Michael O&#x27;Sullivan, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote, &quot;What I&#x27;m not so fond of is the cop-out ultimately taken by the filmmakers, who can&#x27;t seem to follow through on their promisingly metaphysical premise (let alone the theme of obsessive love), electing instead to eliminate all ambiguity&quot;. In his review for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Jack Mathews called the film, &quot;corny, plodding, implausible and – on occasion – seriously creepy&quot;.

However, Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and compared it to &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; saying, &quot;&quot;Birth&quot; is less sensational and more ominous, and also more intriguing because instead of going for quick thrills, it explores what might really happen if a 10-year-old turned up and said what Sean says&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott praised Nicole Kidman&#x27;s performance: &quot;Without Ms. Kidman&#x27;s brilliantly nuanced performance, &quot;Birth&quot; might feel arch, chilly and a little sadistic, but she gives herself so completely to the role that the film becomes both spellbinding and heartbreaking, a delicate chamber piece with the large, troubled heart of an opera.&quot; &quot;Birth&quot; was placed at 96 on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; best films of the 2000s. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in August 2010, film critic David Thomson included the film in his list of &quot;10 lost works of genius&quot;.

While the film divided critics and audiences mostly &quot;stayed away&quot; upon release, the reception of the film has been reassessed over the years, with some publications calling it a masterpiece and Kidman&#x27;s performance recognized as one of the best of her career.

===Controversy===
The film generated controversy due to a scene wherein Kidman&#x27;s character shares a bath with Bright&#x27;s character, both apparently naked. In fact, Bright was never naked and the two were never even in the same room during the filming of the bath scene apart from one camera shot, and when this shot happened both wore special clothes that were not visible to the camera. Glazer insists that the scene is not erotic or exploitative. &quot;I can imagine that, before people see it, they might think it was salacious. But I knew it was never going to be that.&quot;

At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Kidman addressed the controversy of her character kissing a boy: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that I wanted to make a film where I kiss a 10-year-old boy. I wanted to make a film where you understand love.&quot; Further controversy occurred at the festival when a journalist described Kidman as a &quot;screen legend&quot;, to which her co-star Lauren Bacall replied, &quot;She is a beginner&quot;. Kidman downplayed Bacall&#x27;s remarks and said, &quot;I certainly don&#x27;t feel like a big star in Hollywood&quot;.

Complaints of the film&#x27;s &quot;cop-out&quot; ending are questioned by Roger Ebert in his review, who notes: &quot;There seem to be two possible explanations for what finally happens, but neither one is consistent with all of the facts.&quot;

<text>Silsila () is a 1981 Indian Hindi-language musical romantic drama film co-written, directed, and produced by Yash Chopra. The story revolves around the love triangle of a romantic playwright Amit (Amitabh Bachchan), his wife Shobha (Jaya Bachchan), and his former lover Chandni (Rekha). The soundtrack was composed by Shiv–Hari, with lyrics from Javed Akhtar, Hasan Kamal, Meera Dev Burman, Nida Fazli, Rajendra Krishan, and Harivansh Rai Bachchan.

&quot;Silsila&quot; attracted considerable attention from the media when it was in production due to its casting. Principal photography took place in Amsterdam, Bombay (now Mumbai), Delhi, and Kashmir from November 1980 and May 1981. The film, however, failed at the box office after releasing on 14 August 1981, grossing only . At the 29th Filmfare Awards, the film received nominations for Best Actor (Amitabh Bachchan), Best Actress (Jaya Bachchan), and Best Music Director (Shiv–Hari). Critically, it received negative notice for the story and the cast&#x27;s performances.

==Plot==
Orphaned at a young age, brothers Shekhar and Amit Malhotra enjoy a close relationship but live independently. Shekhar, the older brother, is a squadron leader in the Indian Air Force, while Amit is a Delhi-based romantic playwright. Shekhar introduces Amit to his fiancée, Shobha, and the three form a camaraderie. Amit, in turn, meets Chandni and their relationship blossoms into love with hopes of marriage. Before Amit is able to introduce Chandni to Shekhar, Shekhar dies in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Shobha is subsequently revealed to be pregnant with Shekhar&#x27;s child. Devastated from the loss of Shekhar, Amit marries Shobha to shield her from societal scorn and the stigma of being an unwed mother, and to honor Shekhar&#x27;s memory. He sends a letter to Chandni ending their relationship, professing his love but urging her to move on, leaving Chandni heartbroken.

Tragedy strikes once more when Amit and Shobha are injured in a car accident and Shobha suffers a miscarriage. She is treated by Dr. V.K. Anand, who is revealed to have married Chandni. Without a child to bind them together, Amit and Shobha settle into their passionless marriage. Amit befriends Dr. Anand in an attempt to rekindle his romance with Chandni, who eventually gives in. They meet secretly, although not without arousing the suspicions of Shobha, who despite her history with Shekhar has come to revere Amit. On the way home from a tryst, Amit and Chandni injure a pedestrian with their car. Their affair is endangered when the policeman investigating the accident happens to be Shobha&#x27;s cousin, who is protective of Shobha and intends to expose Amit.

Amit decides to leave his loveless marriage to be with Chandni. The news shatters Shobha, who has genuinely fallen for Amit but believes that her love will make him return. Dr. Anand is also aware of Chandni&#x27;s infidelity and feels devastated. When Dr. Anand leaves on a business trip, Amit and Chandni secretly leave town to start a new life. Anand&#x27;s plane then crashes, causing Amit, Chandni, and Shobha to rush to the wreckage site. There, Amit is confronted by Shobha, who reveals that she is expecting his child. He vows to return to her, then rushes to rescue Anand from the wreckage. Chandni realizes her love for her husband and returns to him. The film ends with Amit and Shobha living happily in their marriage.

==Production==
&quot;Silsila&quot; was directed and produced by Yash Chopra for his banner Yash Raj Films. He co-wrote the screenplay with Sagar Sarhadi, who also co-wrote the story with Preeti Bedi. According to Sarhadi, Chopra &quot;fell madly in love with the subject&quot;. The dialogue was written by Romesh Sharma. The film is about an extramarital relationship, the first time for a Hindi-language film; after he failed with action films, Chopra had decided to make a romantic film for his next venture.

Chopra&#x27;s biographer Rachel Dwyer described the casting as complicated, for which the film was controversial before release. Speculations about the relationship between Amitabh Bachchan, who was married to Jaya Bachchan, and Rekha was common in gossip magazines and newspapers at the time. Chopra called his ability to cast the three his greatest achievement. He initially considered Parveen Babi and Smita Patil for Rekha&#x27;s and Jaya Bachchan&#x27;s parts, respectively, but abandoned the plans owing to their unsuitability in playing their respective roles. On the recommendations of Amitabh Bachchan, who had agreed to star in the film in 1980, Chopra subsequently replaced them with Rekha and Jaya Bachchan. Rekha designed her own costumes and jewellery. This was her final collaboration with Amitabh Bachchan.

&quot;Silsila&quot; was shot by Raju Kaygee. Filming was done from November 1980 to May 1981, starting in Kashmir and later Amsterdam, Bombay (now Mumbai), and Delhi. Wanting no exposure from the media, Chopra did the filming privately with the entire cast and crew. He described the production as &quot;real life coming into reel life&quot; but said that there are no incidents on the sets and all the lead actors were co-operative. The Delhi schedule sometimes took place at 5.30 PM when the weather was cold; Rekha recounted how she hated it and that she did so only for Chopra. The film, edited by Keshav Naidu, runs for 166 minutes. Hariprasad Chaurasia and Shivkumar Sharma provided the background score.

==Music==
The soundtrack to the film, released by Saregama on 18 May 1981, was composed by Shiv–Hari. The lyrics were by Javed Akhtar, Hasan Kamal, Meera Dev Burman, Nida Fazli, Rajendra Krishan, and Harivansh Rai Bachchan. &quot;Yeh Kahan Aa Gaye Hum&quot; was one of the songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar in her concert &quot;Lata Live&quot;. Akhtar, who previously collaborated with Salim Khan in screenwriting, turned to lyrical composition and &quot;Dekha Ek Khwab&quot; was his first written song. Akhtar was chosen after Chopra hearing his poetry and being astonished by it. &quot;Rang Barse Bhige Chunar Wali&quot; became one of the most-played songs in the Holi celebration.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Silsila&quot; was released on 14 August 1981 and failed at the box office, which Chopra believed was due to the audience&#x27;s attentions mostly given to the controversy, resulted by the casting, rather than the plot. Around a week later, a screening was held at the Mumbai Metro and collected , with being donated to the Nargis Dutt Foundation. Sunil Sethi of &quot;India Today&quot; criticized the cliché storyline and called the cast uninteresting. In his review, Sethi concluded,

 &quot;But &quot;Silsila&quot; itself is pure polyester yarn. It&#x27;s a lot less real than the so-called dirty, distorted and damaging stories that appear in the gossip press which the stars claim are so distressing. At least they read better, look better and may be include half-truths here and there. &quot;Silsila&quot; looks good, too, but is a distortion of half-lies, which is worse.&quot;

Dwyer wrote that Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s then-popular screen persona as an &quot;angry young man&quot;, which he got from &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), was incompatible with his role in &quot;Silsila&quot; as a lover. The film received three nominations at the 29th Filmfare Awards: Best Actor (Amitabh Bachchan), Best Actress (Jaya Bachchan), and Best Music Director (Shiv–Hari). It marked the beginning of the setback in Chopra&#x27;s career; in spite of this, he called &quot;Silsila&quot; one of his favourite films in a 2011 interview.

<text>Sens () is a commune in the Yonne department in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in north-central France, 120 km southeast from Paris.

Sens is a sub-prefecture and the second largest city of the department, the sixth largest in the region. It is crossed by the Yonne and the Vanne, which empties into the Yonne here. At the last census of 2021, the municipality had 27,034 inhabitants. Its inhabitants are called les &quot;Senonese&quot; in French. 

The city was rewarded with the distinction of Grand Prix et quatre fleurs in 2007 at Concours des villes et villages fleuris.

== Geography ==
Sens is located at the extreme north-west of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, on the border of three regions, namely the Île-de-France, the Grand Est and the Centre-Val de Loire. Located on the course of the river Yonne in the valley of the same name, the city is bordered by the hills of Paron and Saint-Martin-du-Tertre to the west, extension of the plateau of Gâtinais which also extends to the Loiret. To the east, it is bordered by the forest of Othe which extends over the department of Aube. To the north, the Yonne valley leads to the Brie in Seine-et-Marne. 

== History ==
The city is said to have been one of the oppida of the Senones, one of the oldest Celtic tribes living in Gaul. The Battle of the Allia was fought between the Senones – a Gallic tribe led by Brennus, who had invaded Northern Italy – and the Roman Republic. It is mentioned as Agedincum by Julius Caesar several times in his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;. In 53 BC, during the invasion of Gaul, Caesar wintered six legions, at the place called « the camp of Caesar » south of the city.
The Roman city was built during the first century BC and surrounded by walls during the third (notable parts of the walls still remain, with alterations along the centuries). It still retains today the skeleton of its Roman street plan. The site was referred to by Ammianus Marcellinus as &quot;Senones&quot; (&quot;oppidum Senonas&quot;), where the future emperor Julian faced an Alamannic siege for a few months, but it did not become an administrative center until after the reorganization of the Roman Empire in 375, when it was the chief town of Lugdunensis Quarta.

During the Middle Ages its archbishops held the prestigious role of primate of Gaul and Germany. The bishop of Sens became an archbishop as early as the mid-5th century, but the cult of the traditional founders Savinian and Potentian, not mentioned by Gregory of Tours, did not appear until the 8th century, when they were added to the local recension of the Seventy Apostles. The Hôtel de Sens in Paris was their official residence in that city. The Archdiocese of Sens ruled over the dioceses of Chartres, Auxerre, Meaux, Paris, Orléans, Nevers and Troyes, summarized by the acronym CAMPONT.

Starting from 1135, the cathedral of Sens, dedicated to Saint Stephen, was rebuilt as one of the first Gothic cathedrals. There, in 1234, Louis IX of France celebrated his wedding to Marguerite of Provence. Sens witnessed the trial of Peter Abelard. Pope Alexander III sojourned for some time in the city, and Thomas Becket spent part of his exile between 1162 and 1165. The Archdiocese of Sens hosted a number of church councils and the first Archbishop of Uppsala was consecrated there. William of Sens was the principal architect of Canterbury Cathedral.

Sens experienced troublesome times during the Wars of Religion. In 1562, 100 of the town’s Huguenot population were killed in the Massacre of Sens.

The city declined after Paris was elevated to archdiocese in 1622. Since 2002, Sens remains an archbishopric (though the incumbent has resided in Auxerre since 1929?) but with no metropolitical function (no pallium or marriage appeals).

Despite the creation of new regions, Sens remains subject to the Paris cour d&#x27;appel.

<text>Galindo Aznárez II (died 922) was Count of Aragon from 893 to 922. He was the son of Aznar Galíndez II and his wife Onneca Garcés, daughter of King García Íñiguez of Pamplona.

==Life==
Galindo succeeded his father as Count of Aragon. In 905 he was part of a coalition that sponsored a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Pamplona in favor of his brother-in-law, Sancho I, that overthrew the ruling Íñiguez dynasty which was replaced by the Jiménez dynasty, another branch that was more favorable to the interests of Aragon. However, he turned on this new king and on 911 attacked him in concert with brother-in-law Muhammad al-Tawil and Abd Allah ibn Lubb al-Qasawi. This coalition was defeated, al-Tawil killed, and Galindo forced to become vassal of Sancho.

==Marriages and issue==
Galindo was married twice. By his first wife, Acibella, daughter of Count García II Sánchez of Gascony, and his wife Amuna of Périgord, he had three children:
* Toda Galíndez, married to Bernat I, Count of Ribagorza, to whom she brought Sobrarbe.
* Redemptus Galíndez, bishop.
* Mirón Galíndez, who probably died before his father since he did not inherit the county in spite of being a legitimate son.

By his second wife, Sancha Garcés of Pamplona, daughter of García Jiménez and Onneca Rebelle of Sangüesa, and half-sister of Sancho I, he had:
* Andregoto Galíndez, who inherited the Aragonese county. She was queen of Pamplona by her marriage with her first cousin García Sanchez, king of Pamplona (925–970). 
* Velasquita Galíndez, first married Íñigo López de Estigi y Ciligueta. She could also have been the wife of Count Fortún Jiménez of Aragon ( 943–958).
Galindo also sired several illegitimate sons: Guntislo, Sancho, Belasco, Banzo—father of a Galindo—and Aznar.

<text>The 3 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]] of the [[Yonne]] [[Departments of France|department]] are:

# Arrondissement of Auxerre, (prefecture of the Yonne department: Auxerre) with 170 communes. The population of the arrondissement was 161,976 in 2021.
# Arrondissement of Avallon, (subprefecture: Avallon) with 135 communes. The population of the arrondissement was 40,732 in 2021.
# Arrondissement of Sens, (subprefecture: Sens) with 118 communes. The population of the arrondissement was 130,677 in 2021.

==History==

In 1800 the arrondissements of Auxerre, Avallon, Joigny, Sens and Tonnerre were established. The arrondissements of Joigny and Tonnerre were abolished in 1926.

The borders of the arrondissements of Yonne were modified in January 2017:
* three communes from the arrondissement of Auxerre to the arrondissement of Avallon
* 12 communes from the arrondissement of Auxerre to the arrondissement of Sens
* 13 communes from the arrondissement of Avallon to the arrondissement of Auxerre

<doc id="1105295" wikidata="Q830230" url="?curid=1105295" title="Sill (geology)">
<text>In geology, a sill is a tabular sheet intrusion that has intruded between older layers of sedimentary rock, beds of volcanic lava or tuff, or along the direction of foliation in metamorphic rock. A sill is a &quot;concordant intrusive sheet&quot;, meaning that it does not cut across preexisting rock beds. Stacking of sills builds a sill complex and a large magma chamber at high magma flux. In contrast, a dike is a discordant intrusive sheet, which does cut across older rocks. 

== Formation ==
Sills are fed by dikes, except in unusual locations where they form in nearly vertical beds attached directly to a magma source. The rocks must be brittle and fracture to create the planes along which the magma intrudes the parent rock bodies, whether this occurs along preexisting planes between sedimentary or volcanic beds or weakened planes related to foliation in metamorphic rock. These planes or weakened areas allow the intrusion of a thin sheet-like body of magma paralleling the existing bedding planes, concordant fracture zone, or foliations. Sills run parallel to beds (layers) and foliations in the surrounding country rock. They can be originally emplaced in a horizontal orientation, although tectonic processes may cause subsequent rotation of horizontal sills up to near vertical orientations. 

Sills can be confused with solidified lava flows; however, there are several differences between them. Intruded sills will show partial melting and incorporation of the surrounding country rock. On both contact surfaces of the country rock into which the sill has intruded, evidence of heating will be observed (contact metamorphism). Lava flows will show this evidence only on the lower side of the flow. In addition, lava flows will typically show evidence of vesicles (bubbles) where gases escaped into the atmosphere. Because sills form below the surface, even though generally at shallow depths (up to a few kilometers), the pressure of overlying rock means few if any vesicles can form in a sill. Lava flows will also typically show evidence of weathering on their upper surface, whereas sills, if still covered by country rock, typically do not.

==Associated ore deposits==
Certain layered intrusions are a variety of sill that often contain important ore deposits. Precambrian examples include the Bushveld, Insizwa and the Great Dyke complexes of southern Africa; and the Duluth intrusive complex along Lake Superior, and the Stillwater igneous complex of the United States. Phanerozoic examples are usually smaller and include the Rùm peridotite complex of Scotland and the Skaergaard igneous complex of east Greenland. These intrusions often contain concentrations of gold, platinum, chromium and other rare elements.

==Transgressive sills==

Despite their concordant nature, many large sills change stratigraphic level within the intruded sequence, with each concordant part of the intrusion linked by relatively short dike-like segments. Such sills are known as &quot;transgressive.&quot; The geometry of large sill complexes in sedimentary basins has become clearer with the availability of 3D seismic reflection data. Such data has shown that many sills have an overall saucer shape and that many others are at least in part transgressive.

Examples include the Whin Sill and sills within the Karoo basin.

<text>George Hamilton Perkins Greenough (born November 6, 1941) is an influential surfer, known during the 1960s and 1970s for his work in film, and in surfboard design, fin characteristics, and other creations for the aquatic medium. The contributions of Greenough, along with Bob McTavish, to the development of short boards resulted in a number advances in surfboard shaping and other surfing technology.

==Personal life==
George Greenough was born in Santa Barbara, California, to Hamilton Perkins Greenough and Helen Marie Greenough, née Jensen. George’s father, Hamilton Perkins Greenough, spent part of his career as a shipwright, building wooden picket boats for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Contrary to what many people have written, George Greenough is not a direct descendant of the famous American sculptor, Horatio Greenough, but they are half second cousins four times removed.

George underwent open-heart surgery at age ten and became known as an unconventional &quot;character&quot;, &quot;... a thin-faced, narrow-shouldered scion ... always shoeless, often shirt-less, resin-stained Levis clamped onto his nonexistent hips with a length of rope, stringy blonde hair cut straight across at eyebrow level and flapping down over his ears.&quot; Greenough was not known to surf at crowded surf breaks, but preferred the solitude of northern Hollister Ranch or surfing Rincon at dusk to avoid the crowds. In 1964, Greenough went to Australia and travelled back and forth between Santa Barbara and his new home for some time. He now resides in Byron Bay, in New South Wales, Australia.

==Surfing influence==
Greenough is credited with the design of the modern surfboard fin, as well as influencing modern surfing&#x27;s more radical maneuvers. The newer short boards were built specifically to copy the same style of banking turns and fast-down-the line attitude that Greenough was known for. Greenough started to shape his first boards out of balsa wood in his high school wood shop. He started as a stand-up surfer in the 1950s, but then began switching between kneeboarding and an air-inflated mattress in 1961. According to Greenough, they gave him a heightened sense of speed that came from a lowered body position. The famous &quot;spoon&quot;&#x27; board was created in 1961, &quot;a blunt-nosed balsa kneeboard, 5 feet long and 23 inches wide, with a dished-out midsection and tail that slimmed down to a mere half-inch thickness&quot;. He replaced the normal surfboard fin of the day, a massive protrusion, with a smaller (almost by a third) flexible swept-back model he had copied from the shape of the rear dorsal fin of a tuna. That design had the effect of reducing drag and increasing the handling capabilities of the board. The new fin, which Greenough called a &quot;high aspect ratio fin&quot;, was an elegantly functional piece of equipment, but took around three years to become popular.

In 1964, Greenough traveled to Australia, where he showed the local surfers his wave riding style of sharp bottom turns and deep barrel rides. He influenced Nat Young, who used Greenough&#x27;s fin design and won the 1966 world surfing championships in San Diego, California, ushering in an era of surfing history during which Australians emerged as a dominant force. Young described Greenough as &quot;The greatest surfer in the world today,&quot; After this first visit to Australia, Greenough shaped a board which he explained as the next step in the progression of surfing, &quot;a fish moves when he swims… so why not make a whole board that moves when it&#x27;s on a wave?&quot; The board he created had multiple layers of fiberglass shaped like the old balsa kneeboards he rode, a glued on ridge of polyurethane foam on top of the deck near the rails and nose, with the back end of the board made entirely of fiberglass. The final piece of the board was his signature &quot;flex-fin&quot;. The board was so small and light that it was not very suitable for small surf. Only in big surf did the board reveal its performance abilities and allow Greenough to maneuver on waves with more power and speed than with previous designs: &quot;Greenough was riding like a visitor from ten years in surfing&#x27;s future. He cranked out bottom turns where his board tilted up almost 90 degrees…&quot; In 1966, he made his second board, which he nicknamed the &quot;velo&quot;, from &quot;velocity&quot;.

==Movies==
Greenough has made multiple films in his career; he would swim out into the surf with fins and take pictures looking out from the inside of the barrel. This &quot;barrel-vision&quot; was regarded as a major progression in surf photography. His film, The Innermost Limits of Pure Fun, was shot using a massive 28 pound camera with a water-proof housing strapped onto his shoulder which he used to show the inside of a wave. His film was considered so inspiring by surfers that entire audiences of them would yell and shout for the duration of the movie. The film caught the attention of a new band called Pink Floyd who donated music for the loosely biographical following film, Crystal Voyager, which Greenough wrote and narrated; Pink Floyd also used the film as a backdrop for their concerts.
Coca-Cola used some of Greenough&#x27;s videos of wave barrels in a television advertisement in 1975. Part of &quot;Crystal Voyager&quot; was shot at ten times normal speed, creating a continuous flow of intensely detailed images of water droplets hitting the lens, all moving in dance-like synchronization with the motion of the wave. Greenough has worked in recent decades on &quot;Dolphin Glide&quot;, an experimental underwater photo series which captures images of dolphins riding waves, using a special ski he invented. Greenough is also featured in an early scene in Bruce Brown&#x27;s surf film &quot;The Endless Summer&quot;.

==Boats==
While tinkering with surfboard designs, Greenough also experimented in boat hull design. While living in California he redeveloped the American Boston Whaler hull to suit his particular needs, which included capsize resistance and open ocean mishandling flaws such as &quot;pearling&quot; and &quot;broaching&quot;. He designed a modified cathedral type hull and has used this design to build a number of beach-launchable and offshore fishing boats for himself for use both in America and Australia. 
He built a 15 foot version in Australia which he rigged with a camera boom for filming his movie &quot;Dolphin Glide&quot;. His hull design is an exceptionally good performer in the rugged surf experienced on the Australian coastline, and it allowed him to follow and film pods of Dolphins through the breaking surf without fear of mishap. His next development was an expanded jet-ski type watercraft which was intended as a &quot;Rescue Craft&quot; in the hopes the Surf Life Savers New South Wales (SLSNSW) would pick it up as a replacement for their current fleet of jet skis, but little interest was shown by the SLSNSW. He has since used this boat primarily for fishing the reefs offshore Eastern Australia. This ocean craft design, known as the GARC (Greenough Advanced Rescue Craft), was a product he developed to perform rescue missions in the breaking surfline and on the open ocean. The GARC is currently manufactured by &quot;MAPC&quot; (Maritime Applied Physics Corporation), which holds the patents for the craft. This jet-ski look-alike is a more rugged and stable version that can be launched in the waves or by an aircraft. The development of the open transom and the stern tongue make it possible for rescues without having to actually lift the person in trouble out of the water. The GARC holds four people and will be used by the United States Navy, Coast Guard, and National Guard.

<text>Skewen () is a village within the county borough of Neath Port Talbot, in Wales. The village is served by Skewen railway station and has its own rugby club.

==History==
Skewen was once an industrial village. There were a number of collieries around the village (see link below). The Crown and Mines Royal Copper Works and the Cheadle and Neath Abbey Ironworks were once important industrial sites which stood close by. Old top-loading blast furnaces can also be seen at Neath Abbey. To the south of Skewen lies the village of Llandarcy, the site of the country&#x27;s first oil refinery. The site of this former oil refinery is now being developed as an urban village called Coed Darcy, a development which was promoted at its start by the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Foundation for the Built Environment.

==Monuments of interest==
The ruins of Neath Abbey, a former Cistercian monastery, are now in the care of Cadw. On Mynydd Drumau to the north of the village is an ancient standing stone known as the Carreg Bica (or &#x27;Maen Bradwen&#x27;).

==Notable people==
*The village is the birthplace of Sir Samuel Thomas Evans (1859–1918), British judge and politician who was appointed Solicitor-General in 1908 and became the President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division in 1910.
*Skewen is also the birthplace of internationally successful singer Bonnie Tyler and Welsh composer David John de Lloyd (1883-1948).
*Comedian Eddie Izzard lived in the village for a short time during childhood. 
* The grandparents of the legendary American entrepreneur Howard Hughes are believed to have lived in Skewen in the 1930s.
* The notorious murderer, Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Maude Jones, née Baker (1926-?), was born in Skewen. In October 1944, she and an American paratrooper named Karl Hulten (1922-1944), sometimes branded &quot;the Blackout Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, carried out a series of brutal crimes that culminated in the murder of a London taxi driver. Both she and Hulten were sentenced to death, but Jones was reprieved by the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison.

<text> (; also spelled &quot;ex-gratia&quot;) is Latin for &quot;by favor&quot;, and is most often used in a legal context. When something has been done &quot;ex gratia&quot;, it has been done voluntarily, out of kindness or grace. In law, an &quot;ex gratia payment&quot; is a payment made without the giver recognising any liability or legal obligation.

==Examples==
Compensation payments are often made ex gratia if a government or organization is prepared to compensate victims of an event such as an accident or similar but not to admit liability to pay compensation or for causing the event.

* A company conducting layoffs may make an &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment to the affected employees that is greater than the statutory payment required by the law, perhaps if those employees had a long and well-performing service with the company.
* An insurance company may make an &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment to customers if a claim does not meet the terms and conditions but the company chooses to make a voluntary payment out of kindness or compassion, without recognizing any obligation to make such a payment.
* When the USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; fired upon Iran Air Flight 655 in 1988, killing some 290 people, the US President decided that the United States would offer compensation, on an &quot;ex gratia&quot; basis, to the families of the victims.
* In a more routine context, Suffolk County Council&#x27;s document &quot;Ex-Gratia Payments for Loss of or Damage to Personal Property&quot; shows how an education authority compensates victims for damage but without accepting a liability to do so.
* Following the 1994 Black Hawk shootdown incident, on 26 August 1994, the US Department of Defense announced that it would pay $100,000 in compensation to the families of each of the non-US personnel killed in the friendly-fire incident. 
* Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh announced &quot;ex gratia&quot; payments of 100,000 rupees (about US$2,000) to the next of kin of those who died in the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings. Those injured would be given ₹50,000 (about US$1,000) each. 
* The prime minister of Malaysia, Datuk Seri Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi, announced in June 2008 undisclosed &quot;ex gratia&quot; payments to the judges who were affected during the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis.
* Malaysia Airlines offered an &quot;ex gratia&quot; condolence payment of US$50,000 to the families of each passenger aboard the missing (assumed crashed) flight MH370, but those affected have considered the conditions unacceptable and have asked the airline to review them.
* In 2016, the New Zealand government awarded David Bain an &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment of NZ$925,000. While Bain had been acquitted of murdering his family in a retrial held in 2009, the defence had failed to prove his innocence.

<doc id="1105344" wikidata="Q312258" url="?curid=1105344" title="Jacques Demy">
<text>Jacques Demy (; 5 June 1931 – 27 October 1990) was a French director, screenwriter and lyricist. He appeared at the height of the French New Wave alongside contemporaries like Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. Demy&#x27;s films are celebrated for their visual style, which drew upon diverse sources such as classic Hollywood musicals, the plein-air realism of his French New Wave colleagues, fairy tales, jazz, Japanese manga, and the opera. His films contain overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by Michel Legrand) and motifs like teenage love, labor rights, chance encounters, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality. He was married to Agnès Varda, another prominent director of the French New Wave. Demy is best known for the two musicals he directed in the mid-1960s: &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1967).

==Career==
After working with the animator Paul Grimault and the filmmaker Georges Rouquier, Demy directed &quot;Lola&quot;, his first feature film, in 1961, with Anouk Aimée playing the eponymous cabaret singer. The Demy universe emerges here: Characters burst into song (courtesy of composer and lifelong Demy-collaborator Michel Legrand); iconic Hollywood imagery is appropriated, as in the opening scene with the man in a white Stetson in the Cadillac; plot is dictated by the director&#x27;s fascination with fate and stock themes of chance encounters and long-lost love; and the setting, as with many of Demy&#x27;s films, is the French Atlantic coast of his childhood, specifically the seaport town of Nantes.

&quot;La Baie des Anges&quot; (&quot;The Bay of Angels&quot;, 1963), starring Jeanne Moreau, took the theme of fate further, with its story of love at the roulette tables.

Demy is perhaps best known for his original musical &quot;Les Parapluies de Cherbourg&quot; (&quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;, 1964), with a score by Legrand. The whimsical concept of singing all the dialogue sets the tone for this tragedy of the everyday. The film also sees the emergence of Demy&#x27;s trademark visual style, shot in saturated supercolour, with every detail—neckties, wallpaper, Catherine Deneuve&#x27;s bleached-blonde hair—selected for visual impact. Roland Cassard, the young man from &quot;Lola&quot; (Marc Michel) reappears here, marrying Deneuve&#x27;s character. Such reappearances are typical of Demy&#x27;s work. Kurt Vonnegut was a huge fan of &quot;Les Parapluies&quot;, writing in private correspondence: &quot;I saw &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;, which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That&#x27;s all right. I like to have my heart broken.&quot;

Demy&#x27;s subsequent films never quite captured audience and critical acclaim the way &quot;Les Parapluies&quot; did, although he continued to make ambitious and original dramas and musicals. &quot;Les Demoiselles de Rochefort&quot; (1967), another whimsical-yet-melancholic musical, features Deneuve and her sister Françoise Dorléac as sisters living in the seaside town of Rochefort, daughters of Danielle Darrieux. It was shot in color widescreen CinemaScope and featured an Oscar-nominated musical score as well as dance appearances by Gene Kelly and &quot;West Side Story&quot;&#x27;s George Chakiris.

In 1968, after Columbia Pictures gave Demy a lucrative offer to shoot his first film in America, he and his wife, film director Agnès Varda, moved to Los Angeles briefly. Demy&#x27;s movie was a naturalistic drama: 1969&#x27;s &quot;Model Shop&quot;. Lola (Anouk Aimée) reappears, her dreams shattered, her life having taken a turn for the worse. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre (Jeanne Moreau&#x27;s character from &quot;Bay of Angels&quot;), Lola is scrounging to make enough money to return to France and her child by working as a nude model in a backdoor model-shop on the Sunset Strip. She runs into an aimless, young architect (Gary Lockwood), who navigates the streets of Los Angeles; like Lola, he is looking for love and meaning in life. &quot;Model Shop&quot; is a time capsule of late-1960s Los Angeles and documents the death of the hippie movement, the Vietnam draft, and the ennui and misery that results from broken relationships. This bleakness and decided lack of whimsy—uncharacteristic for Demy—had a large amount to do with &quot;Model Shop&quot;&#x27;s critical and commercial failure.

&quot;Peau d&#x27;Âne&quot; (&quot;Donkey Skin&quot;, 1970) was a step in the opposite direction as a visually extravagant musical interpretation of a classic French fairy tale which highlights the tale&#x27;s incestuous overtones, starring Deneuve, Jean Marais, and Delphine Seyrig. It was Demy&#x27;s first foray into the world of fairy tales and historical fantasia, which he explored in &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; and &quot;Lady Oscar.&quot;

Although none of Demy&#x27;s subsequent films captured the contemporary success of his earlier work, some have been reappraised: David Thomson wrote about &quot;the fascinating application of the operatic technique to an unusually dark story&quot; in &quot;Une chambre en ville&quot; (&quot;A Room in Town&quot;, 1982). &quot;L&#x27;événement le plus important depuis que l&#x27;homme a marché sur la lune (1973) (&quot;A Slightly Pregnant Man&quot;)&quot; is a look back at the pressures of second-wave feminism in France and the fears it elicited in men. &quot;Lady Oscar&quot; (1979), based on the Japanese manga series &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot;, has been discussed and analyzed for its queer and political subtext (the title character is born female, her father raises her as a male so she can get ahead in 18th-century French aristocracy, and she eventually falls in love with her surrogate brother, a working-class revolutionary).

&quot;Parapluies de Cherbourg&quot; has been color-restored twice from original prints by Demy. In 2014, The Criterion Collection released a boxed set of Demy&#x27;s &quot;essential&quot; work, with hours of supplements, essays, and restored image and sound. The films include &quot;Lola&quot;, &quot;Bay of Angels&quot;, &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;, &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot;, &quot;Donkey Skin&quot;, and &quot;Une Chambre en Ville&quot; as well as most of Demy&#x27;s early short films.

==Personal life==

As a student, Demy did not learn any foreign languages. In the 1960s, with the help of some classes, internships, and spending some time in the United States, he learned English. At the time of the Anouchka project, which took many years to complete, he also learned Russian.
In the early 1970s, taking after the example of Michel Legrand, he earned his private pilot&#x27;s license for passenger planes.

Jacques Demy was bisexual. In 1958, Jacques Demy and Agnès Varda met at a short film festival in Tours. The two married in 1962. They had a son together, Mathieu Demy (born 1972), and Demy also adopted Varda&#x27;s daughter, Rosalie Varda (born 1958), whom she had with Antoine Bourseiller in a previous relationship. Together, Demy and Varda owned a home in Paris and another property with an old mill on the Noirmoutier Island in Vendée, where the shots of Demy on a beach in &quot;Jacquot de Nantes&quot; (1991) were taken. The film is a version of Demy&#x27;s autobiographical notebooks, an account of Demy&#x27;s childhood and his lifelong love of theatre and cinema. Varda paid homage to her husband in &quot;Jacquot de Nantes&quot;, &quot;Les demoiselles ont eu 25 ans&quot; (1993), and &quot;L’Univers de Jacques Demy&quot; (1995).

Demy died on October 27, 1990, at the age of 59. Originally, it was reported that he died of cancer, but in 2008 Varda revealed that Demy died of HIV/AIDS. He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

<text>Keith Baker is an American game designer and fantasy novel author. In addition to working with Wizards of the Coast on the creation of Eberron, he has also contributed material for Goodman Games, Paizo Publishing and Green Ronin Publishing. In 2014, Baker and Jennifer Ellis co-founded the indie tabletop game company Twogether Studios.

== Personal life ==
Baker lives in Portland, Oregon. He has a tattoo of the Greater Mark of Making on his right arm. He is married to product designer Jenn Ellis.

==Career==
Prior to working in the role-playing game industry, he worked in the video game industry with Magnet Interactive Studios and a Colorado company, VR1.

Keith Baker started as a freelancer known for his work at Atlas Games. His &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign setting of Eberron was chosen as the winner among the 11,000 submissions to the Wizards of the Coast Fantasy Setting Search in 2002. Baker designed the &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot; (2004) book with James Wyatt and Bill Slavicsek, the first book to focus on the background of the setting.

Baker has been a role-playing game designer across multiple systems besides &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, including systems such as &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, &quot;13th Age&quot; (2012) and &quot;Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana&quot; (2015). Essays by Baker on role-playing design and other game features have been published in the Kobold Guides series - including &quot;Adventures&quot; (2008), C&quot;omplete Kobold Guide to Game Design&quot; (2012), &quot;The Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding&quot; (2012), and &quot;Kobold Guide to Gamemastering&quot; (2017).

=== Eberron ===
Baker continued to be a game designer on several 3.5 edition supplements for the Eberron setting such as &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Secrets of Xen&#x27;drik&quot; (2006), and &quot;Secrets of Sarlona&quot; (2007). Baker also wrote &quot;The Dreaming Dark&quot; trilogy of novels set in the Eberron setting, which was published by Wizards of the Coast from 2005 to 2006. Baker wrote a second trilogy, the &quot;Thorn of Breland&quot; series, of Eberron novels for Wizards of the Coast from 2008 to 2010. For the 4th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Baker was a designer on the &quot;Eberron Campaign Guide&quot; (July 2009) and a consultant on the &quot;Eberron Player&#x27;s Guide&quot; (June 2009).

In 2017, Baker joined the podcast &quot;Manifest Zone&quot; which explores the world of Eberron including lore and official products. His co-hosts were Wayne Chang and Kristian Serrano.

For the 5th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Baker was the lead designer of &quot;&quot; (July 2018) which was an official Wizards of the Coast supplement published as a PDF on the Dungeon Masters Guild. The Dungeon Masters Guild, owned by OneBookShelf, is an online store that hosts official Wizards of the Coast products and acts as &quot;a platform for players to publish lore, maps, character designs and adventures based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; intellectual property&quot;. Utilizing the Dungeon Masters Guild, Baker then published two non-official Eberron themed adventures in 2018 and a non-official 5th edition Eberron supplement in 2019. 

Baker was also one of the lead designers of the first hardcover 5th edition Eberron sourcebook, &quot;&quot; (November 2019). In the following year, Baker released two new non-official 5th edition Eberron products on the Dungeon Masters Guild: a campaign guide, &quot;Exploring Eberron&quot; (July 2020), and a supplement, &quot;Eberron Confidential&quot; (November 2020). In December 2020, Baker announced two upcoming Eberron projects which would also be released on the Dungeon Masters Guild in 2022: &quot;Frontiers of Eberron: Threshold&quot; and codenamed &quot;Project: Fool&#x27;s Platinum&quot;. In November 2022, Baker announced that &quot;Frontiers of Eberron: Threshold&quot; had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was now scheduled for release in 2023. However, the release of &quot;Chronicles of Eberron&quot; (2022) was not delayed and was published in December 2022. 

In January 2023, Baker wrote that he was considering a shift away from creating third-party Eberron products and instead concentrating on expanding aspects of &quot;Threshold&quot; that are unconnected to Eberron&#x27;s fictional canon, allowing him to release it as his own intellectual property. In June 2023, Baker announced that his third-party Eberron publishing imprint KB Presents would be shutting down and Visionary Production and Design would take over the stewardship of the Eberron products published on the Dungeon Masters Guild. As part of this handover, a final Eberron product – &quot;Frontiers of Eberron: Quickstone&quot; – was also announced; the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2024) compatible sourcebook was released in September 2024.

=== Twogether Studios ===
In 2014, Baker co-founded a new an indie tabletop game studio with his wife, Jennifer Ellis. In April 2015, Twogether Studios launched their first game, &quot;Phoenix: Dawn Command&quot;, on Kickstarter and raised $67,284. &quot;Phoenix: Dawn Command&quot; is a card-based roleplaying game where players become &quot;more powerful each time they fall in battle&quot;.

In October 2016, Twogether Studios launched their second game, &quot;Illimat&quot;, on Kickstarter and raised $418,628. This set collection game was designed in partnership with the band The Decemberists and illustrated by Carson Ellis. Steve Haske, for &quot;Inverse&quot;, wrote: &quot;Last year, the band’s Chris Funk got in touch with Portland-based Twogether Studios, in order to bring &quot;Illimat&quot; into the real world via a Kickstarter campaign. With game designer Keith Baker (co-founder of Twogether), the two designed a relatively simple game played with cards, a few tokens, and a rotating box — the Illimat itself, that changes the &#x27;seasons&#x27; of the gameplay — so appropriate to The Decemberists’s old-world aesthetic that it has a fascinating sense of authenticity&quot;.

Twogether Studios has launched two more successfully funded card games on Kickstarter: &quot;Action Cats!&quot; (July 2017, raised $17,086) and &quot;Action Pups!&quot; (February 2019, raised $7,273). Both games feature photos of pets that Kickstarter backers submitted.

In September 2019, it was announced that Twogether Studios was working with the McElroy family to create a cooperative storytelling card game adaptation of &quot;The Adventure Zone&quot; called &quot;TAZ: Bureau of Balance&quot;. After its release in 2020, &quot;CBR&quot; called it &quot;a great way to bring the joy of &quot;The Adventure Zone&quot; to the table and get in on the action&quot;. &quot;Io9&quot; highlighted that it &quot;is a great card game for folks wanting to try out (or get back into) RPGs, or more seasoned players who want a cooperative storytelling experience that takes out some of the legwork and guesswork for an afternoon. It’s not going to give you all the thrills and chills of a traditional RPG, but it does enough to simulate the experience&quot;. In 2020, Twogether Studios worked with Podium Audio to release the &quot;Ascend Online&quot; Roleplaying Game, &quot;a micro roleplaying game&quot;, based on the audiobook series of the same name by author Luke Chmilenko. &quot;Io9&quot; reported that &quot;&quot;Ascend Online&quot; is about a group of friends who’ve gotten more than they bargained for in an immersive fantasy video game&quot; and that it is &quot;a mix between &quot;Ready Player One&quot; and &quot;Sword Art Online&quot;&quot;; the free &quot;micro RPG lets players create a party and explore the series’ world, creating their own collaborative adventure along the way&quot;.

=== Awards ===
Baker has won an Origins Award twice, first in 2004 for Best Roleplaying Game Supplement as part of the team for the Eberron campaign setting, then alone in 2005 for Traditional Card Game of the Year for &quot;Gloom&quot;, published by Atlas Games.

Baker was part of the design team for the Pathfinder campaign supplement &quot;The Inner Sea World Guide&quot; which won 2011 ENnie for Best Art, Interior - Gold Winner and for Best Setting - Gold Winner. The book was also nominated for: 2011 ENnie for Product of the Year, 2011 Golden Geek Best RPG Artwork/Presentation, and 2011 Golden Geek Best RPG Supplement Nominee.

Two of the Kobold Guides anthologies Baker has contributed to have won ENnie awards: C&quot;omplete Kobold Guide to Game Design&quot; (2012 ENnie for Best RPG Related Product - Gold Winner) and &quot;The Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding&quot; (2013 ENnie for Best RPG Related Product - Gold Winner and for Best Writing - Gold Winner).

Baker contributed design to the &quot;13th Age Core Book&quot; which won the 2014 ENnie for Best Rules - Silver Winner and was nominated for 2013 Golden Geek Best RPG Artwork/Presentation Nominee, 2013 Golden Geek RPG of the Year Nominee, 2014 ENnie for Best Game.

<doc id="1105355" wikidata="Q1244092" url="?curid=1105355" title="I and Thou">
<text>Ich und Du, usually translated as I and Thou, is a book by Martin Buber, published in 1923. It was first translated from German to English in 1937, with a later translation by Walter Kaufmann being published in 1970. It is Buber’s best-known work, setting forth his critique of modern objectification in relationships with others.

==Premise==

Buber&#x27;s main proposition is that we may address existence in two ways:
# The attitude of the &quot;I&quot; towards an &quot;It&quot;, towards an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience.
# The attitude of the &quot;I&quot; towards &quot;&quot;, in a relationship in which the other is not separated by discrete bounds.
One of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in relationships. In Buber&#x27;s view, all of our relationships bring us ultimately into relationship with God, who is the Eternal Thou. Martin Buber said that every time someone says Thou, they are indirectly addressing God. People can address God as Thou or as God, Buber emphasized how, &quot;You need God in order to be, and God needs you for that which is the meaning of your life.&quot;

Buber explains that humans are defined by two word pairs: &quot;I–It&quot; and &quot;I–Thou&quot;.

The &quot;It&quot; of &quot;I–It&quot; refers to the world of experience and sensation. &quot;I–It&quot; describes entities as discrete objects drawn from a defined set (e.g., he, she or any other objective entity defined by what makes it measurably different from other entities). It can be said that &quot;I&quot; have as many distinct and different relationships with each &quot;It&quot; as there are &quot;Its&quot; in one&#x27;s life. Fundamentally, &quot;It&quot; refers to the world as we experience it.

By contrast, the word pair &quot;I–Thou&quot; describes the world of relations. This is the &quot;I&quot; that does not objectify any &quot;It&quot; but rather acknowledges a living relationship. &quot;I–Thou&quot; relationships are sustained in the spirit and mind of an &quot;I&quot; for however long the feeling or idea of relationship is the dominant mode of perception. A person sitting next to a complete stranger on a park bench may enter into an &quot;I–Thou&quot; relationship with the stranger merely by beginning to think positively about people in general. The stranger is a person as well, and gets instantaneously drawn into a mental or spiritual relationship with the person whose positive thoughts necessarily include the stranger as a member of the set of persons about whom positive thoughts are directed. It is not necessary for the stranger to have any idea that he is being drawn into an &quot;I–Thou&quot; relationship for such a relationship to arise. But what is crucial to understand is the word pair &quot;I–Thou&quot; can refer to a relationship with a tree, the sky, or the park bench itself as much as it can refer to the relationship between two individuals. The essential character of &quot;I–Thou&quot; is the abandonment of the world of sensation, the melting of the between, so that the relationship with another &quot;I&quot; is foremost.

Buber&#x27;s two notions of &quot;I&quot; require attachment of the word &quot;I&quot; to a word partner. The splitting into the individual terms &quot;I&quot; and &quot;it&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; is only for the purposes of analysis. Despite the separation of &quot;I&quot; from the &quot;It&quot; and &quot;Thou&quot; in this very sentence describing the relationship, there is to Buber&#x27;s mind either an &quot;I–Thou&quot; or an &quot;I–It&quot; relationship. Every sentence that a person uses with &quot;I&quot; refers to the two pairs: &quot;I–Thou&quot; and &quot;I–It&quot;, and likewise &quot;I&quot; is implicit in every sentence with &quot;Thou&quot; or &quot;It&quot;. Each &quot;It&quot; is bounded by others and It can only exist through this attachment because for every object there is another object. The &quot;Thou&quot;, on the other hand, has no limitations. When &quot;Thou&quot; is spoken, the speaker has no thing (has nothing), hence, &quot;Thou&quot; is abstract; yet the speaker &quot;takes his stand in relation&quot;.

What does it mean to experience the world? One goes around the world extracting knowledge from the world in experiences betokened by &quot;He&quot;, &quot;She&quot;, and &quot;It&quot;. One also has &quot;I–Thou&quot; relationships. Experience is all physical, but these relationships involve a great deal of spirituality. The twofold nature of the world means that our being in the world has two aspects: the aspect of experience, which is perceived as I–It, and the aspect of relation, which is perceived as I–Thou.

==Examples==
Buber uses an example of a tree and presents five separate relations:
# Looking at the tree as a picture with the color and detail through the aesthetic perception.
# Identifying the tree as movement. The movement includes the flow of the juices through the veins of the tree, the breathing of the leaves, the roots sucking the water, the never-ending activities between the tree and earth and air, and the growth of the tree.
# Categorizing the tree by its type; in other words, studying it.
# Exercising the ability to look at something from a different perspective. &quot;I can subdue its actual presence and form so sternly that I recognize it only as an expression of law&quot;.
# Interpreting the experience of the tree in mathematical terms.
Through all of these relations, the tree is still an object that occupies time and space and still has the characteristics that make it what it is.

If &quot;Thou&quot; is used in the context of an encounter with a human being, the human being is not He, She, or bound by anything. You do not &quot;experience&quot; the human being; rather you can only relate to him or her in the sacredness of the I–Thou relation. The I–Thou relationship cannot be explained; it simply is. Nothing can intervene in the I–Thou relationship. I–Thou is not a means to some object or goal, but a definitive relationship involving the whole being of each subject.

Like the I–Thou relation, love is a subject-to-subject relationship. Love is not a relation of subject to object, but rather a relation in which both members in the relationship are subjects and share the unity of being.

The ultimate Thou is God. In the I–Thou relation there are no barriers. This enables us to relate directly to God. God is ever-present in human consciousness, manifesting in music, literature, and other forms of culture. Inevitably, Thou is addressed as It, and the I–Thou relation becomes the being of the I–Thou relation. God is now spoken to directly, not spoken about.

There is no world that disconnects one from God, a world of It alone, when I–Thou guides one&#x27;s actions. &quot;One who truly meets the world goes out also to God.&quot; God is the worldwide relation to all relations.

== Lasting impacts ==
Martin Buber&#x27;s work of &quot;I and Thou&quot; has had a profound and lasting impact on modern thinking, as well as the field of psychology in particular. Figures in American history have been influenced by this work, including one of the founding fathers of modern humanistic psychology, Carl Rogers. In 1957, Rogers and Buber engaged in their famous Dialogue, where Buber&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;I and Thou&quot; was discussed. Rogers compares his person-centered therapy and the necessary psychological contact to the I–Thou relationship; while Buber does not completely agree, pointing out that the therapist-client relationship is on somewhat unequal footing, they do concede that there are momentary, true connections made between therapist and client that are &quot;reciprocal&quot; and have a degree of &quot;mutuality&quot;. Rogers expressed that in moments where clients undergo true change, there is a distinct connection and understanding between client and therapist, as in I–Thou relationships.

Buber&#x27;s work also influenced the Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The &quot;I–Thou&quot; relationship is quoted in his &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot; and his sermon, &quot;A Testament of Hope.&quot; In that sermon, King describes the cultural and legal climate of segregation in his time as an &quot;I–It&quot; relationship, and that only when the divinity within the African American population is seen is the relationship transformed to &quot;I–Thou.&quot; King says, &quot;I cannot reach fulfillment without thou&quot;. He also mentions this unique relationship in his Letter, reiterating the &quot;I–It&quot; relationship inherent in segregation does reduce human beings to &quot;things&quot;.

<text>The dulcian is a Renaissance woodwind instrument, with a double reed and a folded conical bore. Equivalent terms include , , , , , , and .

The predecessor of the modern bassoon, it flourished between 1550 and 1700, but was probably invented earlier. Towards the end of this period it co-existed with, and was then superseded by, the baroque bassoon. It was played in both secular and sacred contexts, throughout northern and western Europe, as well as in the New World.

==Construction==

The dulcian is generally made from a single piece of maple, with the bores being drilled and reamed first, and then the outside planed to shape. The reed is attached to the end of a metal bocal, inserted into the top of the small bore. Unlike the bassoon it normally has a flared bell, sometimes made from a separate piece of timber. This bell can sometimes be muted, the mute being either detachable, or built into the instrument. The outside of the instrument can also be covered in leather, like the cornett.

Although the bass in F is the most common size, the dulcian comes in many other sizes: tenor (in C), alto (in F or G) and soprano (in C). There are also examples of a &quot;quart bass&quot; dulcian in C and contrabass in F. The range of each instrument is two and a half octaves, centred on the range of the corresponding singing voice: for example, the bass ranges from C2 (two octaves below middle C), to G4 (the G above middle C).

==Evolution==

The reed on the dulcian is fully exposed, allowing the player to control the sound and intonation by embouchure. At the time it first appeared, other double reed instruments either had the reed fully enclosed, like the crumhorn or the bagpipe, or partially enclosed by a &quot;pirouette&quot;, like the shawm. It has been argued the dulcian displaced the bass shawm, on account of its more convenient size, but it has also been argued that the two co-existed and that the bass shawm appeared at about the same time as the bass dulcian.

The instrument seems to have been in wide use by the middle of the sixteenth century. A set of instruments in various sizes exist in Brussels: these have a maker&#x27;s mark of &quot;Melchor&quot; and are thought to be Spanish. Another well known example is a slightly later instrument in Linz, leather covered and with a built-in mute. The latest commonly copied example is by Denner, 1700, which also has a built in mute. Modern copies of the Linz instrument have a smoother sound and reach the high notes more easily, this is even more the case for modern copies of the Denner instrument.

==Function and repertoire==
The dulcian is a flexible instrument, capable of being loud enough to play in outdoor bands, quiet enough for chamber music, and expressive enough to join in with the choir. Its uses would have included playing dance music with the shawms and sackbuts of the city watch, chamber music, and the grand polychoral repertoire from Venice and Germany, such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Heinrich Schütz. There are explicit dulcian parts in the sonatas by Dario Castello.

<text>Major Tom Harnett Harrisson, DSO, OBE (26 September 1911 – 16 January 1976) was a British polymath. In the course of his life he was an ornithologist, explorer, journalist, broadcaster, soldier, guerrilla, ethnologist, museum curator, archaeologist, documentarian, film-maker, conservationist and writer. Although often described as an anthropologist, and sometimes referred to as the &quot;Barefoot Anthropologist&quot;, his degree studies at University of Cambridge, before he left to live in Oxford, were in natural sciences. He was a founder of the social observation organisation Mass-Observation. He conducted ornithological and anthropological research in Sarawak (1932) and the New Hebrides (1933–35), spent much of his life in Borneo (mainly Sarawak) and finished up in the US, the UK and France, before dying in a road accident in Thailand.

==Early life and education==
Harrisson was born on 26 September 1911 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the son of Geoffry Harnett Harrisson (1881–1939), an engineer, and Marie Ellen Cole (1886–1961). Another son, William Damer Harrisson, was born in 1913. The family lived in Concordia, Entre Ríos where his father had been working as a railway engineer and then manager since 1907. In 1914, at the start of the First World War, the family sailed to the United Kingdom where Geoffry Harrisson joined the British army. He was highly decorated for his service and eventually rose to the rank of Brigadier-General.

Harrisson was socially isolated throughout these early years, with no friends apart from his brother. His father was away in the army, and his mother showed little interest in her children. The family moved frequently, and Harrisson later recalled no &quot;lived in, loved place&quot;. With no toys to occupy them, their nanny Kitty Asbury entertained her charges with long country walks, which stimulated a great interest in nature. Harrisson had learnt to read by the age of five by studying Asbury&#x27;s books on natural history. Harrisson&#x27;s great aunt was Ada Cole who campaigned for humane conditions for British horses exported to the continent for slaughter. Harrisson recollected his aunt scolding him when a young boy for being cruel to a slug.

In 1919, Harrisson&#x27;s parents moved back to Argentina, &quot;dumping&quot; – as Harrisson later described it – their sons at Eastacre preparatory school and later Winton House preparatory school, Winchester. School holidays were spent unhappily as paying guests at various vicarages. There was a brief interlude during 1922 and 1923, when Harrisson and his brother were taken back to Argentina by their father. It was the best year of his childhood. With his father as teacher, he learnt to hunt, fly-fish and climb. He became interested in birds: he built an aviary and studied their behaviour. Socially and linguistically isolated in Argentina, he also felt a stranger in England, even more so after his year in South America. In a 1960 radio interview, he reflected on this period, and stated that &quot;this feeling both of belonging intensely, emotionally, sentimentally with England and yet of not belonging to it and finding its habits and its people and its voices and its faces strange keeps on producing sensations even to this day of strangeness wherever I go&quot;.

Harrisson attended Harrow School from 1925 to 1930, a boarder in the house of his sympathetic godfather, Rev. D. B. Kittermaster, who was particularly supportive of boys such as Harrisson who were rebellious and did not fit in. Harrisson had little interest in interacting with his fellow schoolboys, but nevertheless took an intense interest in them, keeping a card index on every boy. He was also fascinated by issues of hierarchy and status at the school. He continued his interest in ornithology, and supported by his housemaster, who allowed him to roam beyond the school grounds, he wrote and published a book on birds of the area. After participating in several bird censuses, at the age of 19 he organized 1300 other birdwatchers in a pioneering census of the Great Crested Grebe. The census later became a fixture of British birdwatching, and brought him into contact with many of the leading figures of natural sciences when he continued his education at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Harrisson enjoyed friendship with such as Malcolm Lowry but abandoned his studies at Cambridge for the ambience of Oxford, whence he participated in expeditions organised with Oxford University Exploration Club - notably a 6 month long expedition to northern Sarawak in 1932, and then a longer one to the New Hebrides from 1934 to 1936.

In 1937, Harrisson, with Humphrey Jennings and Charles Madge, founded Mass-Observation, a project to study the everyday lives of ordinary people in Britain. An early project, Worktown, was based in Bolton. His cousin, BBC World Service broadcaster Anne Symonds (mother of the journalist Matthew Symonds by John Beavan, Baron Ardwick), worked with him at Mass-Observation for a time.

In July 1939 he presented East End, a 45 minute long BBC television documentary in which he &#x27;explore[d] London&#x27;s East End, introducing Cockney and Jew, Lascar and Chinaman, and others of its inhabitants&#x27;. 

==Military service==

During the Second World War Harrisson continued directing Mass-Observation and was radio critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; from May 1942 until June 1944. For much of this time he was in the army and gave up reviewing on leaving the UK. After service in the ranks he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Reconnaissance Corps on 21 November 1943. He had been recruited (some sources say by a confusion of names, despite his apparent suitability) for a plan to use the native peoples of Borneo against the Japanese. He was attached to Z Special Unit (also known as Z Force), part of the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD: a branch of the combined Allied Intelligence Bureau in the South West Pacific theatre). On 25 March 1945, he was parachuted with seven Z Force operatives from a Consolidated Liberator onto a high plateau occupied by the Kelabit people. An autobiographical account of this operation (SEMUT I, one of four SEMUT operations in the area) is given in &quot;World Within&quot; (Cresset Press, 1959); there are also reports – not always flattering – from some of his comrades. His efforts to rescue stranded American airmen shot down over Borneo are a central part of &quot;The Airmen and the Headhunters&quot;, an episode of the PBS television series &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot;. The recommendation for his Distinguished Service Order which was gazetted on 6 March 1947 (and dated 2 November 1946) describes how from his insertion until 15 August 1945 the forces under his command protected the flank of Allied advances, and caused severe disruption to Japanese operations.

==Ethnological work==
Following the war, he was Curator of the Sarawak Museum 1947–1966 (although he did not relinquish his commission until 14 March 1951). In the 1950s and 1960s Tom and Barbara Harrisson undertook pioneering excavations in the West Mouth of the Great Cave at Niah, Sarawak. Their most important discovery was a human skull in deposits dated by radiocarbon to about 40,000 years ago, the earliest date for modern humans in Borneo. The results of their excavations were never published in an appropriate manner leading to uncertainty and doubts as to their results; however, they are largely vindicated by results of excavations carried out by the Niah Cave Project from 2000 to 2003. Three films (amongst more made for British TV) record the Niah work

At the start of the Brunei Revolt in 1962, Resident John Fisher of the 4th Division of Sarawak called on the Dayak tribes for help by sending a boat with the traditional Red Feather of War up the Baram River. Tom Harrisson also arrived in Brunei. He summoned the Kelabits from the highlands around Bario in the 5th Division, the centre of his wartime resistance. Hundreds of Dayaks responded, and formed into companies led by British civilians all commanded by Harrisson. This force reached some 2,000 strong, and with excellent knowledge of the tracks through the interior (there were no roads), helped contain the rebels and cut off their escape route to Indonesia.

==Post-Sarawak==
Following his retirement aged 55 from the curatorship of the Sarawak Museum, in 1967 Harrisson left for Ithaca, New York to start a three-year contract as senior research associate of the South East Program at Cornell University; his notes, maps, and journals for Central Borneo, 1947–1966, are archived there. However, after the second year he relocated to Britain to take an unpaid role at the University of Sussex, to which he had bequeathed the Mass-Observation archive. In 1974 he was appointed visiting professor, despite never having earned a doctoral degree.

==Personal life, and death==
Harrisson married three times. In 1939 he was named as co-respondent in the divorce of Bertha Clayton (1908–1961); they had a son, Maxwell Barr (1940–2002), and married in 1940, but divorced in 1954. He met Barbara Brunig when she worked at his Sarawak Museum; they married in London in 1956, but divorced in 1970 after he had met Christine Forani (1916–1976), a Belgian sculptor; they married in 1971. The couple were killed in Thailand when the bus they were travelling in collided with a truck. They were cremated in Bangkok following Thai customs.

==Legacy==
The title of his biography, &quot;The Most Offending Soul Alive&quot;, gives a flavour of the strong feelings he engendered, but he also had many admirers and is recognised as a pioneer in several areas.

Harrisson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 New Year Honours, for his work as curator.

Harrisson appeared twice on Desert Island Discs: in October 1943 and December 1972

Harrisson&#x27;s series &quot;The Borneo Story&quot; was broadcast by BBC television in 1957; a subsequent series was produced by ITV in 1962/3. A documentary &quot;Tom Harrisson – The Barefoot Anthropologist&quot;, hosted by David Attenborough, was first broadcast on BBC4 early in 2007.

The Bornean subspecies of the Sumatran rhinoceros is named after him as &quot;Didermocerus sumatrensis harrissoni&quot; Groves, 1965

The 1969 novel &quot;Farewell to the King&quot; by Pierre Schoendoerffer was inspired by events from Tom Harrisson&#x27;s wartime Borneo; the book was later turned into a film by John Milius – &quot;Farewell to the King&quot;.

Sam Lightner, Jr.&#x27;s book &quot;All Elevations Unknown: An Adventure in the Heart of Borneo&quot; (Broadway, 2001), tells Harrisson&#x27;s World War II story in chapters that alternate with Lightner&#x27;s account of his own climb of Batu Lawi in the Kelabit Highlands of Sarawak.

<text>In a web browser, the address bar (also location bar or URL bar) is the element that shows the current URL. The user can type a URL into it to navigate to a chosen website. In most modern browsers, non-URLs are automatically sent to a search engine. In a file browser, it serves the same purpose of navigation, but through the file-system hierarchy.

Many address bars offer features like autocomplete and a list of suggestions while the address is being typed in. This auto-correct ion feature bases its suggestions on the browser&#x27;s history. Some browsers have keyboard shortcuts to auto-complete an address.

== Features ==
In addition to the URL, some address bars feature icons showing features or information about the site. For websites using a favicon (a small icon that represents the website), a small icon may be present within the address bar, a generic icon appearing if the website does not specify one. The address bar is also used to show the security status of a web page; various designs are used to distinguish between insecure HTTP and encrypted HTTPS, alongside use of an Extended Validation Certificate, which some websites use to verify their identity.
Most web browsers allow for the use of a search engine if the term typed in is not clearly a URL. This will usually also auto-complete, if the search engine offers this feature, to popular answers, some engines even suggesting answers to basic maths queries. Some browsers, such as Firefox, Opera and Google Chrome, allow for website-specific searches to be set by the user. For example, by associating the shortcut &quot;!w&quot; with Wikipedia, &quot;!w cake&quot; can be entered into the address bar to navigate directly to the Wikipedia article for cake. This feature is standardised for users of the search engine DuckDuckGo as &quot;bangs&quot;.

Web browsers often include a feature called Smart Bookmarks. In this feature, the user sets a command that allows for a function (such as searching, editing, or posting) of a website to be expedited. Then, a keyword or term associated with the command is typed into the address bar followed by entering the term afterwards or selecting the command from a list.

In some browsers, such as Opera and Safari, the address bar can double as a progress bar that indicates how much of the contents of the page has been loaded.

== Comparisons ==
The following sections compare address bar widgets for a few well-known web browsers.

<doc id="1105389" wikidata="Q1789059" url="?curid=1105389" title="Ogmore Castle">
<text>Ogmore Castle () is a Grade I listed castle ruin located near the village of Ogmore in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, east of Ogmore-by-Sea, and south of the town of Bridgend. It is situated on the south bank of the Ewenny River and the east bank of the River Ogmore.

Its construction might have begun in 1106. Ogmore was one of three castles built in the area in the early 12th century, the others being Coity Castle and Newcastle Castle. It was in use until the 19th century for a range of purposes, including a court of justice and a prison, but is now a substantial set of remains and a local landmark. It is managed by local authorities.

==Etymology==
When John Leland wrote his &quot;Itinerary&quot;, he referred to this fortress as &quot;Ogor Castelle&quot;. The name comes from the nearby river, the River Ogmore ().

==History==

Construction of Ogmore Castle might have started around 1106, its foundation predating the Norman conquest. In Caradoc of Llancarfan&#x27;s &quot;The historie of Cambria, now called Wales: a part of the most famous yland of Brytaine&quot;, Caradoc wrote that the manor and castle were given to William de Londres, one of the legendary Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, by Robert Fitzhamon, the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan. In 1116, William de Londres was forced to abandon the castle when the Welsh appeared in force. His butler, Arnold, is credited with protecting the castle from the Welsh attack during the absence of William de Londres, and for this, he was knighted Sir Arnold Butler, also receiving the castle and manor of Dunraven as reward.

According to the custom of the times, the founding of a religious institution followed the acquisition of power. William de Londres, or his descendant John, built Ewenny Abbey from the castle. Also nearby was a religious place appended to Ogmore Castle by Morris de Londres or his descendant John, in 1141; Ewenny Priory is from Ogmore Castle. When Thomas&#x27; heiress married into the Chaworth family of Kidwelly, the lands passed in 1298 to the first Duke of Lancaster, and ownership remains in the hands of the Duchy of Lancaster to this day.

The earthworks were steeply banked and oval in shape, enclosing an area of in length by in width. The inner ward was flat and constructed of timber structures. After completion of the ringwork, the building material was stone. The windows were round-headed with Sutton stone ashlar. The first-floor great hall had an ornate fireplace.

William&#x27;s son Maurice is credited with building the oblong keep; it is perhaps the oldest Norman keep in Glamorgan. Situated north of the main gateway, the keep was the first masonry building and was probably built in the 1120s. It is both the castle&#x27;s tallest surviving building, and one of the oldest buildings in South Wales. Though only three of the original walls survive, their structure is characterized by irregularly shaped field stones, glacial pebbles, Lias limestone slabs, and brown mortar. Thomas de Londres replaced a timber palisade with a stone wall in around 1200.

In the early 13th century, a second storey was added that housed private apartments. Garderobes were featured on two levels and a latrine tower was part of the exterior. A well-preserved lime kiln was built over an indeterminate 13th-century structure. Subsequently, a courthouse dating to the 14th century and rebuilt in the mid-15th century, was probably the third building to occupy the same spot. The building was rectangular in shape with a simple doorway and was flanked by two chambers. Having sustained damage during Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s revolt, a new courthouse, situated in the castle&#x27;s outer bailey, was built in 1454 and was in use until at least 1631.

The present-day castle remains consist of the keep and some outer walls.

==Grounds==

A deep, rock-cut ditch surrounded the castle grounds, which were dry except when the River Ewenny flooded the area during high tide. While the ditch that enclosed the castle&#x27;s inner bailey filled at high tide, the flow was regulated by an embedded stone wall that blocked rising waters so that the interior of the castle did not flood.

Looking towards the sea from the castle ruins, the view includes sandhills that proceed up the coast nearly as far as the town of Briton Ferry. Opposite from Ogmore Castle is Merthyr Mawr, where there are two sculptured crosses; the village can be reached by a footpath from the castle.

Also near the castle are a popular set of stepping stones across the river which are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. A short distance to the southeast are several shallows filled with water that are said to have sunk spontaneously. One of them is circular, measuring approximately in diameter.

==&quot;Y Ladi Wen&quot;==
The ghost &quot;Y Ladi Wen&quot; (&quot;the White Lady&quot;) is said to guard the castle&#x27;s hidden treasure.

In the story, a spirit was long said to wander the wider area until a man finally had the courage to approach her. When such a man eventually did so, the spirit led him to a treasure (a cauldron filled with gold) hidden under a heavy stone within the old castle tower, and allowed the man to take half the treasure for himself. However, the man later returned and took the more of the treasure. This angered the spirit, who, with her fingers turning into claws, attacked the man as he returned home. The man became gravely ill, but only died once he had confessed his greed. After that, an ailment known as &quot;Y Ladi Wen&#x27;s revenge&quot; was said to befall any person who died prior to disclosing hidden treasure.

The Ladi Wen stories associated with the castle, are likely related to a tradition that the River Ogmore itself contains the spirits of those who died without disclosing the location of hidden treasures. The tradition states that these spirits may only rest when their treasures are found and thrown downstream into the river (throwing treasures upstream would not help the spirits).

<doc id="1105391" wikidata="Q3239124" url="?curid=1105391" title="Cheadle (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Cheadle is a borough constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom since 2024 by Tom Morrison of the Liberal Democrats. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first-past-the-post voting system.

It is a marginal seat between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. From 1970 until 2001, it was held by the Conservatives, after which it was held by the Liberal Democrats from 2001 until the 2015 general election, when it was taken back by the Conservatives. It was regained by the Liberal Democrats at the 2024 general election.

== Boundaries ==
1950–1955: The Urban Districts of Bredbury and Romiley, Cheadle and Gatley, Hazel Grove and Bramhall, and Marple.
:&quot;Cheadle and Gatley, previously part of the abolished constituency of Bucklow, Hazel Grove and Bramhall transferred from Knutsford, and Bredbury, Romiley and Marple transferred from Macclesfield.  Also included Mellor (now part of the Urban District of Marple), which was previously in the Derbyshire constituency of High Peak.&quot;

1955–1974: As above except the part of Bredbury ward added to the County Borough of Stockport by the Stockport (Extension) Order 1952, which was transferred to Stockport South (Statutory Instrument 1953–742).

1974–1983: The Urban Districts of Cheadle and Gatley, and Wilmslow.
:&quot;The majority of the constituency was hived off to form Hazel Grove, leaving just Cheadle and Gatley. Partly compensated by the transfer of Wilmslow from Macclesfield.&quot;

From 1 April 1974 until the next boundary review came into effect for the 1983 general election, the constituency comprised parts of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester (Cheadle and Gatley) and parts of the expanded Borough of Macclesfield in Cheshire (Wilmslow), but its boundaries were unchanged.

1983–2010: The Metropolitan Borough of Stockport wards of Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme North, Cheadle Hulme South, East Bramhall, Heald Green, and West Bramhall.
:&quot;Wilmslow included in the new constituency of Tatton in Cheshire, with smaller parts transferred to Macclesfield and Stockport; Bramhall transferred from Hazel Grove.&quot;

2010–2023: The Metropolitan Borough of Stockport wards of Bramhall North, Bramhall South, Cheadle and Gatley, Cheadle Hulme North, Cheadle Hulme South, Heald Green, and Stepping Hill.
:&quot;Boundaries adjusted to take account of revision of local authority wards.&quot;

2023–present: Following a local government boundary review which came into effect in May 2023, the constituency now comprises the following wards or part wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport:

* Bramhall North, Bramhall South &amp; Woodford, Cheadle East &amp; Cheadle Hulme North (part), Cheadle West &amp; Gatley, Cheadle Hulme South, Davenport &amp; Cale Green (small part), Heald Green, Norbury &amp; Woodsmoor (part), Offerton (part), and a very small part of Hazel Grove.

The 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which was based on the ward structure in place at 1 December 2020, left the boundaries unchanged.

== History ==
Cheadle was created as a county constituency under the Representation of the People Act 1948, for the 1950 general election. it covered a predominantly urban and relatively affluent area in the south-eastern suburbs of the Manchester conurbation.

The growth of the suburbs of Manchester led to a rapidly rising electorate from the late 1950s and by the 1970 election there were 107,225 electors and some reduction was inevitable. At the February 1974 general election the seat was re-classified as a borough constituency and split in two, with the eastern parts forming the new Hazel Grove constituency.

As a result of changes to the county boundaries which came into effect on 1 April 1974, the constituency crossed between Greater Manchester and Cheshire. Realigning with the county boundaries in 1983, the constituency was redrawn, losing Wilmslow to Tatton, whilst gaining back Bramhall from Hazel Grove.

== Members of Parliament ==
The current MP is the Liberal Democrat Tom Morrison, who defeated Mary Robinson at the 2024 General Election.

From 1974 (when half of the seat was split off to create the Hazel Grove constituency), Cheadle had safe Conservative majorities until the 1997 election, when the Liberal Democrats reduced the margin to around 3,000 votes. Patsy Calton scraped home in 2001 by a majority of 33 votes, the narrowest in the House of Commons, but returned with a much safer 4,000 votes in 2005. She died on 29 May 2005, triggering a by-election in July 2005, where Mark Hunter was elected with a majority of 3,657. Although held by Hunter in 2010, the Conservatives regained the seat in 2015 and held it in 2017 and 2019, albeit with reduced majorities on each occasion.

== Elections ==

=== Elections in the 2020s ===






=== Elections in the 2010s ===













=== Elections in the 2000s ===










=== Elections in the 1990s ===
The Cheadle constituency underwent minor boundary changes after the 1992 general election and as such the change in share of vote is based on a notional calculation.







=== Elections in the 1980s ===


The boundaries of the constituency changed in 1983. Changes in the vote are based on the estimated results for 1979 had the 1983 boundaries been in operation then.



=== Elections in the 1970s ===






After the 1970 general election, boundary changes created the Hazel Grove constituency which reduced the size of the Cheadle one. The previous Member of Parliament for Cheadle, Dr Michael Winstanley became the first member returned by Hazel Grove.

<text>Dorothy Comstock Riley (December 6, 1924 – October 23, 2004) was a lawyer and judge from the U.S. state of Michigan, serving on the Michigan Supreme Court and the first woman to serve on the Michigan Court of Appeals. She was the first Hispanic woman to be elected to the Supreme Court of any state.

==Life and career==
Riley was born in Detroit, where she attended public schools, graduating from Northwestern High School. She attended Wayne State University, where she earned a B.A. in 1946. She received an LL.B. degree from Wayne State University Law School in 1949. Female lawyers were not common at the time and reportedly, when she interviewed at several law firms after graduation, the qualification they were most interested in was her typing ability. Instead of working at such firms, she began her own practice in the Detroit area.

In 1972, Riley became a Wayne County Circuit Judge and in 1976, she became the first woman to serve on the Michigan Court of Appeals. She ran for the Supreme Court in 1982 and lost. On December 9, 1982, Republican governor William Milliken nevertheless appointed Riley to the Court to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Justice Blair Moody Jr. on November 26. This appointment became the subject of a bitter partisan controversy. Not only had Riley been rejected by the voters, but Milliken was also leaving office in less than a month, and newly elected Democratic governor James Blanchard argued he should be allowed to make the appointment to replace Moody rather than Milliken.

In February 1983, the other Supreme Court Justices voted 4-2 to remove Riley from the court. Blanchard replaced her with U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Boyle. However, Riley won election to the Supreme Court in 1984 and was re-elected in 1992. She served as chief justice from 1987 to 1991. She retired from the Court on September 1, 1997 due to the onset of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Riley had been a partner in the law firm of Riley and Roumell and was also the founder and Honorary Chair of the Michigan Supreme Court Historical Society. In 1991 she was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and the State Bar of Michigan presented Riley with its &quot;Distinguished Public Servant Award&quot; in 2000.

Riley married Wallace D. Riley, a former president of the American Bar Association in 1967. They had one son, Peter Comstock Riley.

She died in Grosse Pointe Farms, aged 79.

<text>A bustle is a padded undergarment or wire frame used to add fullness, or support the drapery, at the back of women&#x27;s dresses in the mid-to-late 19th century. Bustles are worn under the skirt in the back, just below the waist, to keep the skirt from dragging. Heavy fabric tended to pull the back of a skirt down and flatten it. As a result a woman&#x27;s petticoated skirt would lose its shape during everyday wear (from merely sitting down or moving about).

== Origin ==
Women throughout history have used various methods to shape their skirts to accentuate the back of the hips. Padded cushions, historically called &quot;bum rolls&quot;, &quot;bearers&quot;, and &quot;cork rumps&quot;, were among the many methods popular in Europe. They enjoyed sporadic popularity starting in the 16th century and were especially popular in France in the late 18th century. The crinoline was a type of integrated padded petticoat that developed from this technology. The more elaborate and specialized bustle eventually replaced the crinoline. While the wireframe bustle was popular only very briefly, simpler padded cushions returned after the bustle went out of fashion, and have remained popular.

The bustle has been linked to Sarah Baartman by feminist scholars such as Anne Fausto-Sterling. Baartman, a Khoikhoi woman from South Africa, was featured as a circus attraction in Europe in the early 1800s, due to the particular abundance of tissue on her buttocks. This phenotype is called steatopygia. It is not a medical disorder, but it has a genetic cause which is common in Khoisan and Pygmy peoples but rare in Europe.

However, the use of padded cushions and petticoats to accentuate the general shape of the buttocks was already well-established in Europe in the 16th century, long before Sarah Baartman.

==History==

In the early stages of the fashion for the bustle, the fullness to the back of the skirts was carried quite low and often fanned out to create a train. The transition from the voluminous crinoline-enhanced skirts of the 1850s and 1860s can be seen in the loops and gathers of fabric and trimmings worn during this period. The bustle later evolved into a much more pronounced humped shape on the back of the skirt immediately below the waist, with the fabric of the skirts falling quite sharply to the floor, changing the shape of the silhouette.

===Transition from crinoline (1863–1872)===
As the fashion for crinolines wore on, their shape changed. Instead of the large bell-like silhouette previously in vogue, they began to flatten out at the front and sides, creating more fullness at the back of the skirts. This style was known as the &quot;train&quot;. One type of crinoline, the crinolette, created a shape very similar to the one produced by a bustle. Crinolettes were more restrictive than traditional crinolines, as the flat front and bulk created around the posterior made sitting down more difficult for the wearer. The excess skirt fabric created by this alteration in shape was looped around to the back, again creating increased fullness.

===Early bustle (1869–1876)===
The bustle later developed into a feature of fashion on its own after the overskirt of the late 1860s was draped up toward the back and some kind of support was needed for the new draped shape. Fullness of some sort was still considered necessary to make the waist look smaller and the bustle eventually replaced the crinoline completely. The bustle was worn in different shapes for most of the 1870s and 1880s, with a short period of non-bustled, flat-backed dresses from 1878 to 1882.

===Late bustle (1881–1889)===
The bustle reappeared in late 1881, and was exaggerated to become a major fashion feature in the mid and late 1880s, in 1885 reaching preposterous proportions to modern eyes, as used in the play &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; by George Bernard Shaw. The fashion for large bustles ended in 1889.

===1889–1913===
The bustle then survived into the 1890s and early 20th century, as a skirt support was still needed and the curve the bustle provided on the back of the body emphasized the hips. The bustle had completely disappeared by 1905, as the long corset of the early 20th century was now successful in shaping the body to protrude behind. The bustle was also abandoned by some women for more practical dress to be able to use the newly invented bicycle.

===Contemporary fashion===
Bustles and bustle gowns are rarely worn in contemporary society. Notable exceptions survive in the realms of haute couture and bridal fashion, in addition to dedicated Neo-Victorian aesthetic circles including the steampunk, Gothic, and Lolita subcultures. Bustles are also employed as part of period costuming in film and theatre: an example would be the 1992 film &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, for which costume designer Eiko Ishioka won an Academy Award. The film features several extravagant bustle gowns created for female leads Winona Ryder and Sadie Frost.

==Other usage==
* Bustle is also the term used for an additional external space at the rear of a tank&#x27;s turret used for storing extra equipment, a notable usage being the added box at the rear of the turret on the Sherman Firefly variant. Its positioning on the vehicle resembling the similar placement of the bustle as used on the dress item.
* In sailboat design, a bustle stern refers to any kind of stern that has a large &quot;bustle&quot; or blister at the waterline below the stern to prevent the stern from squatting when getting underway, or to a similar shape produced by the IOR measuring system.
* The term bustleback was used to describe cars styled with an additional rear protrusion that were produced in the early 1980s, such as the Cadillac Bustleback Seville.

<text>The Grenada national football team represents Grenada in international football, and is controlled by the Grenada Football Association, a member of the Caribbean Football Union of CONCACAF. The team is nicknamed &quot;The Spice Boys&quot;, a reference to the country being nicknamed the &quot;Island of Spice&quot; or the &quot;Spice Isle&quot;.

Grenada has never qualified for the World Cup but have finished second in the Caribbean Cup in 1989 and 2008. Their second-place finish in the 2008 Caribbean Cup gave Grenada its first qualification to a major international competition, that being the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==History==

===Beginnings and early tournaments (1934–1989)===

Grenada played its first international match, on 13 October 1934, against British Guiana, which they defeated 2–1. They played British Guiana twice, Barbados and St Kitts and Nevis before the Second World War started in 1939, winning all of those contests.

In 1961, Grenada participated in the Windward Islands Tournament, losing their opening game to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 6–3, but winning their next two matches against Saint Lucia 4–0 and Dominica 8–1 to win the tournament. Grenada won the tournament again the following year, beating Saint Vincent 2–1 in the final, and for four consecutive years from 1967 to 1970.

Grenada played their first competitive match in the 1979 CFU Championship qualifiers against Trinidad and Tobago, losing 3–1 on aggregate. Grenada entered the 1981 CONCACAF Championship qualification but lost in the preliminary round to Guyana 8–4 over two legs. Their next competitive match came in the 1985 CFU Championship qualifiers, but they lost both matches and failed to progress past the first round. Grenada had more success in the CFU Championship&#x27;s successor tournament, reaching the 1989 Caribbean Cup final before losing 2–1 to Trinidad and Tobago.

===Caribbean Cup and qualifiers (1990–2010)===

Grenada qualified for the 1990 Caribbean Cup but lost again to Trinidad and Tobago, this time 5–0 before drawing with Jamaica 0–0 therefore failing to advance. In the qualifiers for the 1994 Caribbean Cup, Grenada was eliminated by Barbados in an infamous match where Barbados purposefully scored an own-goal in order to force overtime and help them to advance, which they did. Grenada qualified to the 1997 Caribbean Cup, reaching the semi-finals before losing to Saint Kitts and Nevis. Grenada entered the 1998 World Cup qualifiers but after getting through the preliminary round by beating Guyana 8–1 on aggregate, they lost 7–1 over two legs to Haiti.

In the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, Grenada was knocked out by Barbados who won with a tight 5–4 aggregate score. They were luckier four years later in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, once again eliminating Guyana (8–1 on aggregate) in the first round before falling to the USA who edged them 6–2. Granada would close this decade with a new World Cup disappointment, in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, being eliminated by Costa Rica 5–2.

===Gold Cup===

Nineteen years after finishing runner-up in the 1989 Caribbean Cup, the &quot;Spice Boyz&quot; once again reached the final, in the 2008 edition, although they lost to the hosts, Jamaica 2–0. However, this result allowed them to qualify for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup for the first time, however Grenada failed to score a goal in the competition whilst conceding ten times and collecting no points. In the 2010 Caribbean Cup, Grenada reached the semi-finals before again being eliminated by Jamaica though their performance earned them qualification for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup but they again failed to capitalise, losing all three group matches and scoring only a single goal.

===2012–present===

Since 2012, Grenada have not managed to progress to the Caribbean Cup or the CONCACAF Gold Cup. In the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, they finished bottom of their qualifying group despite being the top seed, then in 2018 World Cup qualification they were eliminated by Haiti in the third round.

In the 2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League qualifying, Grenada suffered its largest ever defeat, losing 10–0 against Curaçao. They&#x27;d eventually qualify for League B before earning promotion to League A for the 2022–23 CONCACAF Nations League competition.

<doc id="1105403" wikidata="Q3428563" url="?curid=1105403" title="Revolution X">
<text>Revolution X is a shooting gallery video game developed by Midway and released in arcades in 1994. The gameplay is similar to Midway&#x27;s earlier &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, but is themed around the band Aerosmith. The oppressive New Order Nation regime and their leader Helga have abducted Aerosmith, and players use a mounted gun to control onscreen crosshairs and shoot enemies. The members of Aerosmith are hidden throughout the game&#x27;s international locales and must be found in order to receive the game&#x27;s true ending.

The arcade game was a critical and commercial success, but all of the ports were negatively received.

== Plot ==
In a dystopian version of 1996, an alliance of corrupt government and corporate military forces have taken control of the world in the guise of the &quot;New Order Nation&quot; (NON). The NON, with their vampish commander Head Mistress Helga (portrayed by Kerri Hoskins)), have declared war on youth culture (anyone aged from 13 to 30) and have banned all forms of music, television, magazines, and video games. The player travels to &quot;Club X&quot; in Los Angeles to see Aerosmith perform live, but the band is captured by NON troops and hustled off the stage in the middle of their show. After escaping from the club, the player steals a helicopter and flies across the city to find the band&#x27;s car. From here, the player must destroy three NON installations in the Middle East, Amazon Jungle, and Pacific Rim, then travel to London to defeat Helga and her remaining forces at Wembley Stadium.

==Gameplay==
Controls consist of a mounted machine gun with unlimited ammunition, which fires as long as the trigger is held down, and a button on the side that fires one CD per press.

&quot;Revolution X&quot; is a rail shooter in which the players must shoot targets including NON soldiers and vehicles, with the ultimate goals of destroying the NON and rescuing the members of Aerosmith. Players start the game at Club X in Los Angeles, first fighting the NON troops inside and then stealing a helicopter to fly across the city and find Aerosmith&#x27;s car. They must then destroy three NON facilities in the Amazon jungle, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. These three stages may be played in any order; however, failing to complete the Middle East stage within a set time limit will send the players back to its start for another attempt. Finally, the players advance to Wembley Stadium for the final battle with the surviving NON forces and Head Mistress Helga. Throughout the game, crates and background objects can be shot to reveal power-ups like health-replenishing shakes, CDs, powerful laserdiscs and Super Guns, shields, and Skull Bombs that destroy every enemy on the screen. Players can also find hostages and free them throughout the game for extra points.

At the end of each stage, the players receive bonus points based on the number of enemies killed and hostages rescued, as well as the amount of damage done. The five members of Aerosmith are hidden in secret locations throughout the game. When found, each member presents the player with a set of Aerosmith wings that increase the end-of-stage bonus. All members must be found in order to unlock the best ending and bonus level, in which the players go backstage after blowing up Helga, and can collect high-value Mammy Awards, as well as party with the band.

==Development and release==
&quot;Revolution X&quot; originated as a shooting game based on the rebellious nature of and importance of music in 1990&#x27;s Generation X culture. Hip Hop group Public Enemy was approached to be featured in the game, and called the game was to be titled &quot;Generation X&quot;. The title was scrapped after Marvel Comics sent a cease and desist letter to Midway, warning them that the title used the same name as a Marvel comic. Public Enemy declined to be featured in the game after the controversial reception to &quot;Mortal Kombat&#x27;s&quot; graphic depictions of violence.

Midway digitized performances of Aerosmith to be used in the game using the same digitization technology used for their previous arcade titles. Joey Kramer was digitized without a physical drum set - he would air drum his playing along with a song playback, with the &quot;physical&quot; drums added in later by Midway.
&quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; features an advertisement with the old &quot;Revolution X&quot; logo that arcade operators could toggle on and off. Occasionally after a large in-game explosion, Steven Tyler can be heard saying &quot;Toasty!&quot; in a high-pitched voice in reference to an easter egg in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. The game was originally developed as a title based on the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. However, Sega acquired the rights instead and eventually released its own arcade game based on the film. Midway then retooled its concept to revolve around Aerosmith.

The first release labeled Proto 5.0 (5/23/1994) is lacking several speech samples spoken by members of Aerosmith which can be heard after collecting power-ups and has a shorter Pacific Rim level. Revision 1.0 (6/16/1994) restored the missing speech samples and has the complete Pacific Rim level and completed two new crosshairs in P2 and P3 as well as the ability to toggle the CD Offer screen on and off by the operator. &quot;Revolution X&quot; was released as upright two player and deluxe three player arcade units and as a conversion kit for existing gun games such as &quot;Terminator 2: The Arcade Game&quot;.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack consists of several Aerosmith songs continuously looped, including &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, and &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. A Muzak version of &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot; plays in the elevator part of the Amazon Jungle level. The soundtrack was featured in the CD Offer after playing or during attract mode.

The console versions include loops of &quot;Rag Doll&quot; for the attract screen, main menu, and score, &quot;Fever&quot; for the Middle East level, and &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot; for the ending.

==Ports==
The game was later ported by Rage Software, and released by Acclaim for MS-DOS computers, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Mega Drive, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn. A 32X version was demonstrated at the 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo, but was never released, and possibly never completed. An Atari Jaguar conversion was in development and slated to be published around the fourth quarter of 1995, but it was never released.

==Reception==

In North America, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Revolution X&quot; to be the fifth most-popular upright arcade game at the time. &quot;Play Meter&quot; also listed the game to be the second most-popular arcade game at the time. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the arcade version a rave review, praising the ability to choose from multiple paths, the numerous secret items, the sharp graphics, and the Aerosmith soundtrack. They concluded &quot;Rev X is not a revolution in gun games, but it&#x27;s definitely the best one yet.&quot; In a retrospective review, &quot;Allgame&quot; said it &quot;can be quite a bit of fun&quot;, citing the tongue-in-cheek silliness and the ability to choose one&#x27;s path at certain junctures.

The home versions of the game, however, were thoroughly condemned by critics. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; highly praised the digitized voices and music of the SNES version, with two of them going so far as to say they were the best they&#x27;d heard on any 16-bit console, but nonetheless concluded it to be an inexcusably poor conversion. They particularly noted the absence of many graphical details from the arcade version and the awkward, sluggish movement of the control cursor. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s The Axe Grinder also criticized the graphics and controls, remarking that &quot;Moving your target sight is a breeze, but accurately pinpointing small targets is difficult.&quot; He disagreed with EGM on the audio, describing the music as dull and the sound effects as infrequent and muted. In the same issue, Air Hendrix found the same targeting problems in the Genesis version, and said it &quot;desperately needs&quot; light gun support. He also found the graphics to be grainy and choppy and the sounds to be static-ridden. Reviewers for &quot;Next Generation&quot; ridiculed the &quot;laughable graphics, indistinguishable digitized voices, and awful music&quot;, and added that the game is overly repetitive and simply not fun.

Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; panned the PlayStation version. Citing prominent slowdown, mediocre graphics, and a bland soundtrack, he assessed that &quot;With standard shooting that doesn&#x27;t live up to its arcade counterpart, Rev X seems like an old game wheezing through on its past reputation&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; commented, &quot;This shooter ... was popular in the arcades, but this conversion is abysmal.&quot; IGN gave the PlayStation version a 1 out of 10. They complained of slow controls and poor graphics and concluded that &quot;&quot;Revolution X&quot; isn&#x27;t the worst game ever made, but it sure comes close.&quot;

Echoing Scary Larry&#x27;s assessment of the PlayStation version, &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Bruised Lee commented that &quot;Acclaim took Midway&#x27;s smash arcade hit and turned it into a complete miss for the Saturn.&quot; He complained of blocky graphics, dull backgrounds, repetitive gameplay, extreme slowdown, and poor sound effects. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; summarized it as &quot;An incredibly bland and monotonous game matched only by the blandness and monotony of the band that endorse it&quot;, citing overlong boss fights and a lack of intelligent design to where the enemies appear.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Seanbaby placed the Super NES version as number 10 in his &quot;20 worst games of all time&quot; feature.

Conversely, Spanish magazine &quot;Superjuegos&quot; gave the SNES version 91, regarding the scaling as one of the best in 16 bits, and the soundtrack as one of the best in the console. The magazine was also complimentary to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions, giving both a score of 92, regarding the scaling as the best seen on a console.

<doc id="1105412" wikidata="Q83656" url="?curid=1105412" title="Kinsey (film)">
<text>Kinsey is a 2004 American biographical drama film written and directed by Bill Condon. It describes the life of Alfred Charles Kinsey (played by Liam Neeson), a pioneer in the area of sexology. His 1948 publication, &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; (the first of the Kinsey Reports) was one of the first recorded works that tried to scientifically address and investigate sexual behavior in humans. The film also stars Laura Linney (in a performance nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress), Chris O&#x27;Donnell, Peter Sarsgaard, Timothy Hutton, John Lithgow, Tim Curry, and Oliver Platt.

==Plot==
Professor Alfred Kinsey is interviewed about his sexual history. Interspersed with the interview are flashbacks from his childhood and young-adulthood. The early years show his father, a lay minister of the Methodist church, denouncing modern inventions as leading to sexual sin, then in early adolescence, humiliating Kinsey in a store by denouncing its keeper for showing him cigarettes, while his adolescence shows his experiences as a Boy Scout and a late teenage scene shows Kinsey disappointing his father by his chosen vocational intentions. The adult Kinsey teaches at Indiana University as a professor of biology lecturing on gall wasps.

Kinsey falls in love with a student in his class, whom he calls Mac, and marries her. Consummation of their marriage is difficult at first, because of a medical problem Mac has that is fixed easily with minor surgery. At the university, Professor Kinsey, who is affectionately called &quot;Prok&quot; by his graduate students, meets with them after hours to offer individual sexual advice.

At a book party celebrating Kinsey&#x27;s latest publication on gall wasps, Kinsey approaches the dean of students about an open-forum sex education course as opposed to the anti-sex propaganda taught in a general health education class. It is approved, but on the grounds that it is open only to teachers, graduate or senior students, and married students. Kinsey begins teaching the sex course to a packed auditorium.

Kinsey continues answering students&#x27; questions in personal meetings but his answers are severely limited by the paucity of scientific data about human sexual behavior. This leads Kinsey to pass out questionnaires in his sexual education class from which he learns of the enormous disparity between what society had assumed people do and what their actual practices are. After securing financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation, Kinsey and his research assistants, including his closest assistant, Clyde Martin, travel the country, interviewing subjects about their sexual histories.

As time progresses Kinsey realizes that sexuality within humans, including himself, is a lot more varied than was originally thought. The range of expression he creates becomes known as the Kinsey scale, which ranks overall sexuality from completely heterosexual to completely homosexual.

The first sexological book Kinsey publishes, which is on the sexual habits of the male, is a large-scale success and a best seller. Kinsey turns his research to women and is met with more controversy. With the release of the volume on female sexual behavior, support for his work declines in a time when Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s witch hunts against Communists and homosexuals (the latter known as the Lavender Scare) lead the Rockefeller Foundation to withdraw its financial support, fearing that it be labeled &quot;Communist&quot; for backing the subversion of traditional American values.

Kinsey feels he has failed everyone who has ever been a victim of sexual ignorance. A customs officer is tipped off to an importation of some of Kinsey&#x27;s research material, which only exacerbates the financial hardship of Kinsey&#x27;s research organization. Kinsey suffers a heart attack, and is found to have developed an addiction to barbiturates. Meeting with other philanthropists fails to garner the support needed. Still, Kinsey continues his taking of sex histories.

Returning to the initial interview, Kinsey is asked about love and whether he will ever conduct research on it. He responds that love is impossible to measure and impossible to quantify, but that it is important. Kinsey and Mac pull over to the side of the road for a nature walk. She remarks about a tree that has been there for a thousand years. Kinsey replies that the tree seems to display a strong love in the way its roots grip the earth. The two walk off together, Kinsey remarking &quot;there&#x27;s a lot of work to do&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
Producer Gail Mutrux handed Bill Condon a biography of Kinsey in 1999 to spark his interest in writing a screenplay. Condon then based his original screenplay on elements in the biography combined with his own original research on Kinsey.

Ian McKellen was at one point in negotiations for a supporting role.

==Release==
&quot;Kinsey&quot; was the first film permitted to show human genitalia uncensored in Japan, known for its strict censorship policies regarding genitalia.

==Reception==
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 196 reviews, with an average rating of 7.66/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A biopic of the sex researcher is hailed as adventurous, clever, and subversive, with fine performances by Liam Neeson and Laura Linney.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Reviewing in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave &quot;Kinsey&quot; four out of four stars and hailed it as a &quot;fascinating bio&quot; whose strength lies in &quot;the clarity it brings to its title character ... a complete original, a person of intelligence and extremes&quot;, as well as how it &quot;captures its times, and a political and moral climate of fear and repression&quot;. Ebert compared Neeson&#x27;s performance to that of Russell Crowe in the 2001 biopic &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.

The film grossed $10,254,979 domestically and $16,918,723 worldwide on an $11 million budget.

<doc id="1105423" wikidata="Q4049445" url="?curid=1105423" title="Siebe Gorman Salvus">
<text>The Siebe Gorman Salvus is a light oxygen rebreather for industrial use (including by firemen and in coalmine rescue) or in shallow diving. Its duration on a filling is 30 to 40 minutes. It was very common in Britain during World War II and for a long time afterwards. Underwater the Salvus is very compact and can be used where a diver with a bigger breathing set cannot get in, such as inside cockpits of ditched aircraft. It was made by Siebe Gorman &amp; Company, LTD in London, England. It was designed in the early 1900s.

==Function==
Its arrangement can be seen from the image. It is a pendulum-type system with one breathing tube. This type is the Neck Salvus: there was another type, for use on land only, where the counterlung (= breathing bag) hung by his left hip from the cylinder and canister pack. That pack is a metal plate (probably aluminium), with a webbing sheet stuck to one side to protect its user&#x27;s diving suit or overall. The absorbent canister and the cylinder are fastened to it by a strap that can be unbuckled. It has no plastic in its construction.

The mask has an inner orinasal mask to cut down on dead-space. It does not have a shutoff valve. It has a wooden plug fastened to it by a light chain; that plug fits into the breathing tube entry inside the mask to stop debris from entering, but is not a watertight seal. The mask and its tube unscrews from the canister and can be replaced by a tube ending in a mouthpiece. The mouthpiece tube has a shutoff valve at the mouthpiece. The Salvus mouthpiece also has an attached noseclip. A pair of industrial-type eyes-only goggles was included with the set when it came. That mouthpiece has an outer flap that goes outside the lips and is extended into straps fastened behind the neck.

(That makes the mouthpiece much securer against coming out or leaking. In a test when diving with an open-circuit aqualung that had that sort of strapped-in mouthpiece, the diver went limp as if unconscious, to test the mouthpiece, and as a result he rolled belly-up, and his cheeks inflated, and the mouthpiece tried to float out, but its strap and outer flap kept it in and watertight.)

The breathing bag makes the diver very stern-heavy, but that can be cured by putting 6 pounds of diver&#x27;s weights (e.g. a pair of lead-shot-filled anklets) inside the wetsuit chest. The Salvus has no provision to connect to a buoyancy device; but the Salvus can be worn with a separate diver&#x27;s lifejacket (not a stab jacket) which has its own small inflation cylinder.

There is a small water catchment sump and drain on the underside of the canister. Its cylinder pressure gauge is on a flexible metal tube and fits in a circular webbing pouch threaded on the waist harness strap.

The bag tube unscrews from the canister pack. The diagonal strap clips onto a corner of the side-pack. The cylinder has a constant-flow valve and a bypass. The thread on top of the cylinder is the same as on an oxy-gas torch oxygen cylinder but the opposite gender, for easy refilling by decanting.

==History==

Early versions were originally designed for use in bad breathing conditions such as in underground mines and other enclosed spaces, where heavy concentrations of noxious gases could build up and affect the workers.

During World War I, Salvuses were used by machine gunner units on the Western Front (1915) as an interim protection against enemy gas weapons. During World War II the Salvus Mk.VI model was used by British troops. Mk. VI&#x27;s were also used by the National Fire Service: their cooler boxes were marked with the letters &#x27;NFS&#x27;.

War-surplus Salvuses were much used by early sport divers in Britain and Australia in the 1950s before aqualungs became readily affordably available.

At the coalmine rescue on 7–9 September 1950 at Knockshinnoch Castle Colliery near New Cumnock, Ayrshire, Scotland, 115 trapped miners were equipped with Salvuses borrowed from fire stations around to bring them out through a gas-filled mine passage.

<doc id="1105426" wikidata="Q4931443" url="?curid=1105426" title="Boards.ie">
<text>Boards.ie is a large Internet forum in Ireland.

 the site had more than 360,000 members, 3,200,000 threads and 64 million posts. A wide variety of topics from entertainment (e.g. music, radio television, films) to jobs to politics to bereavement and to personal relationships are widely discussed, mostly from an Irish perspective. It also has sections (&quot;forums&quot;) for games and puzzles. Participation in the forums requires free registration.

==History==
In 1998, John &quot;Cloud&quot; Breslin created a single forum to enable discussion amongst Irish users of the id Software game &quot;Quake&quot;, while he was a postgraduate student at the National University of Ireland, Galway. This forum was part of the Irish Games Network&#x27;s quake.ie site, and utilized &quot;Matt&#x27;s WWWBoard&quot; software. The site gained in popularity until the size of its threads exceeded the capacity of the software. Breslin came into contact with Tom Murphy, who had been administrating a Quake-related forum called &quot;Quakapalooza&quot;, utilizing Murphy&#x27;s ASP software. Some non-gaming related forums were added to the service, and the retitled &quot;Cloud Boards&quot; began using the Ultimate Bulletin Board software. Murphy proposed a more general (not just Quake-related) forum, dedicated to general Irish issues in 1999, and considered the name &quot;boards.ie&quot; to be a more useful and desired domain.

In 2000, Cloud Boards was then rebranded for a more general audience. Limitations in what organizations could register prevented private individuals from registering vanity or custom domains. Breslin had previously been unsuccessful in registering the domain &quot;cloud.ie&quot; with the Irish domain registry. Murphy entered a bet with Breslin that he could successfully register a domain for a rebranded web forum. Murphy renamed his company Spin Solutions to Boards for a day in order to trick the system, registered the paperwork with the Irish domain registrar for boards.ie, and was granted the domain.

In 2003, boards.ie achieved one million posts to its forums.

In 2007, the boards.ie Ltd. company acquired the rights to &quot;boards.us&quot; and other domains from Breslin.

In 2008, boards.ie hired its first full-time developer. For the 10th anniversary of boards.ie&#x27;s first post, the complete data set of its discussions with semantic markup (see SIOC) was made available to researchers, and a competition looking for interesting creations based on this data was launched. Later that year in August, boards.ie saw its first shareholding investment from Daft Media Ltd.

==Structure==
The site is majority owned by Distilled Media Ltd with a minority stake held by some of the original company founders, who delegate administrative and editorial control over the site to hundreds of unpaid moderators.

Currently, Tom Murphy is operating as acting managing director after the departure of the previous managing director, Gerry Shanahan, in February 2009. There are over 1,350 forums, public and private.

It is operated by Boards.ie Limited, an Irish Commercial Company, more specifically in the same headquarters of Daft.ie (DAFT MEDIA LIMITED), in Golden Lane, Dublin 8, both of which are owned by the Distilled Media Group. Boards.ie Limited is considered a small company, since its balance sheet total does not exceed 4.4million euro, and is registered as a commercial company involved in &quot;computer and related activities.&quot; Boards.ie Ltd was set up on Mon the 24th of Jan 2000 in Dublin 8.

Boards.ie started life as a forum for the computer game, &quot;Quake&quot;, in 1998. It was registered as a company two years later. In 2008, it was considered one of the largest indigenous Irish websites. However, its latest accounts show it had accumulated losses of €445,000 and rising, dropping more than €100,000 in those 12 months alone. It also had a hole of €65,000 in its balance sheet, a full four years after Daft got involved.

A new forum can be proposed by anyone, but requires a certain amount of support from other members. Most users do not pay any usage fees, although subscription is offered with benefits such as custom avatars and a change of username, amongst other features.

==Expansion==

The &quot;boards.ie&quot; site expanded into a number of other countries including &quot;boards.org.uk&quot; (United Kingdom), &quot;boards.us&quot; (United States), &quot;boards.jp&quot; (Japan), &quot;boards.com.cn&quot; (China), and &quot;boards.co.nz&quot; (New Zealand), but all have since closed. Sites associated with classified advertising (&quot;adverts.ie&quot;) and group coupons (&quot;boardsdeals.ie&quot;) have also been established.

==Cyber-attacks==
On January 21, 2010, at 11:20 GMT, boards.ie director Tom Murphy took the site offline after an attack on the forum&#x27;s database. The attack originated from a source outside Ireland. A portion of the database, including usernames, encrypted passwords and email addresses were accessed. The site advised all users who used the same password on other websites to change it there too.

A DDoS attack in January 2016 disabled boards.ie for a few days. Starting on 17 January, the sustained attack brought the site down on 18 January; the site resumed service on 20 January. Other major Irish sites also experienced attacks in the same timeframe.

==Awards==
boards.ie was awarded a Zeddy Award in 2001. (The Zeddy Awards have since been discontinued.) It also won a Golden Spider Award in the same year.

For his contribution to Irish society, Tom Murphy was awarded a Net Visionary Award by the Irish Internet Association in 2004 in the &quot;Social Contribution&quot; category.

John Breslin was awarded Net Visionary Awards by the Irish Internet Association in 2005 and 2006.

boards.ie won two awards in the Irish Web Awards 2008, &quot;Best Website in Ireland&quot; and &quot;Best Discussion Forum&quot;. It also won &quot;Best Social Networking and Community Website&quot; in the Golden Spider Awards 2008.

<text>The year 1543 in [[science]] and technology includes the 1543 Nicolaus Copernicus publication &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot;) often cited as the beginning of the Scientific Revolution, and also includes many other events, some of which are listed here.

==Astronomy==

* Nicolaus Copernicus publishes &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot;) in Nuremberg, offering entirely abstract mathematical arguments for the existence of the heliocentric universe. It is often cited as the beginning of the Scientific Revolution.

==Mathematics==
* Robert Recorde publishes &quot;The Grounde of Artes, teaching the Worke and Practise of Arithmeticke, both in whole numbers and fractions&quot;, one of the first printed elementary arithmetic textbooks in English and the first to cover algebra. It will go through around forty-five editions in the following century and a half.
* Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia publishes a translation of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; into Italian, the first into any modern European language.

==Medicine==

* Andreas Vesalius publishes &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot; (&quot;On the Fabric of the Human Body&quot;), illustrated by Jan van Calcar, in Basel, revolutionizing the science of human anatomy. He includes an account of a successful experimental tracheotomy for artificial respiration of a canine subject.

==Technology==
* Ralf Hogge, working for Rev. William Levett, casts iron cannon at his blast furnace in the Sussex Weald of England.
* Lighthouse of Genoa completed in present form.

==Births==
* Domenico Fontana (died 1607), Swiss-born architect.
* &quot;approximate date&quot; – William Clowes (died 1604), English surgeon.

==Deaths==
* January 3 – Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo (born c. 1499), Portuguese explorer.
* May 24 – Nicolaus Copernicus (born 1473), Polish astronomer.

<text>The Nokia 6600 is a mobile phone introduced on 16 June 2003 by Nokia, costing approximately €600 when released in October 2003. It was part of Nokia&#x27;s high-end model of the 6xxx Classic Business Series. It runs on Symbian OS 7.0s (Series 60 2nd Edition). It also featured a VGA camera, a music player and video player, Bluetooth and a memory card slot, being the second non-Communicator to do so (after the Nokia 3650).

The model was used in many parts of the world and has proved to be a durable product. Many users consider it a trendsetter phone, which proved to be a bright milestone for its manufacturer. The phone was intended to replace the popular 6310i as the predominant business class model in the Nokia range. It should not be confused with the newer Nokia 6600 fold, Nokia 6600 slide and Nokia 6600i phones which have little resemblance to the original 6600. A variant of the Nokia 6600 was launched in the U.S. market as the Nokia 6620.

During its lifespan, the 6600 sold 150 million units, making it one of the most successful phones to date.

== Features ==
* Integrated (VGA 640x480) camera
* Video recorder with audio support (records up to 95 KB - from 9 to 27 seconds - with built-in recorder application) also
* Streaming video and audio
* Wireless connectivity with Bluetooth and IrDA
* 6 MB internal memory
* MMC card slot for additional user memory and applications
* Java MIDP 2.0 and Symbian(series 60) applications
* Data synchronization with PC via PC Suite and iSync
* Tri-band operation in GSM E900/1800/1900 networks

Additional features:
* ARM compatible (ARM4T architecture)
* Symbian Operating System 7.0s
* CPU running at 104 MHz
* 176x208 (65,536 colours) TFT display
* 5-way joystick navigation
* HSCSD and GPRS, for internet/WAP access

Although the initial batches of the Nokia 6600 were not stable, later system software upgrades corrected the situation.

The phone has the capacity to support the installation of a wide range of third-party software such as mp3 and multimedia players, games, web browsers, office suites, and GUI themes, via Java and ePoc (*.sis) installers. GUI themes can be created using the free Nokia Symbian Theme Studio.

The model was released to the general public in two color schemes: black and white and full black. Additional color schemes (blue and white, pink) were produced for promotional purposes.

In the year 2007, Nokia stopped production of the 6600 handsets.

<text>Cibotium (from Greek , &quot;kibṓtion&quot;, &quot;little chest&quot; or &quot;box&quot;), also known as manfern, is a genus of 11 species of tropical tree ferns. It is the only genus in family Cibotiaceae in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the family may be treated as the subfamily Cibotioideae of a very broadly defined family Cyatheaceae, the family placement used for the genus in &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; .

==Species==
, &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; accepted the following species and hybrids:

Some extinct species have also been placed in this genus:
*†&quot;Cibotium iwatense&quot; 
*†&quot;Cibotium oregonense&quot; 

==Phylogeny==
Phylogeny of &quot;Cibotium&quot;
==Distribution==
Species of the genus are distributed fairly narrowly in Hawaii (four species, plus a hybrid, collectively known as hāpuu), Southeast Asia (five species), and the cloud forests of Central America and Mexico (two species). The natural habitat of &quot;Cibotium&quot; is among the dripping trees and stream gullies of the rainforests on Hawaii&#x27;s windward volcanic slopes.

The fossil record indicates that the genus was once a part of the boreotropical flora found in Europe, eastern North America, and western Asia. Fossilized &quot;Cibotium oregonense&quot; was found near Medford, Oregon, and fossilized &quot;Cibotium iwatense&quot; was found in Iwate, Japan.

No publicly accessible &quot;Cibotium&quot; collections are growing outdoors in the United Kingdom, but two glasshouse collections are kept at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the RBG Edinburgh in Scotland. Specimens of &quot;Cibotium regale&quot; in the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken are visible to the public when the glasshouses open in May. 

==Uses==
&quot;Cibotium glaucum&quot;, from Hawai&#x27;i, is the most frequently encountered &quot;Cibotium&quot; species in the horticultural trade, along with its sibling species &quot;Cibotium chamissoi&quot; and the large-growing &quot;Cibotium menziesii&quot;. They are sometimes seen in California garden designs.

&quot;Cibotium barometz&quot; is best known for its role in ancient medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is used as an anti-inflammatory and an anodyne; its rhizome hairs are used in Malaysia and China as a styptic for wounds. It is still exported from Malaysia for this purpose. Hair-covered pieces of the rhizome, with bud stalks imitating legs, were used to lend credence to the medieval legend of the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, a half-sheep, half-plant hybrid.

Historically, women in Hawai&#x27;i have used the furry part of the &quot;Cibotium&quot; as a tampon.

==Threats==
Pressure on Hawaiian &quot;Cibotium&quot; habitats comes from development encroaching on the forested areas, especially the more accessible, lower-lying areas which are commercially attractive for land clearance. A less obvious threat comes from an invasive introduced tree fern species: &quot;Cyathea cooperi&quot; (the most popular garden tree fern in the United States), which has escaped from the islands&#x27; suburban gardens and now outcompetes the endemic flora. Wind-blown spores from this rapidly growing Australian import can migrate many miles into pristine &quot;Cibotium&quot; forests. This is a fairly recent phenomenon, but one which may eventually have grave consequences for the tree fern ecosystem in Hawaii.

<text>The HOYTS Group of companies in Australia and New Zealand includes HOYTS Cinemas, a cinema chain, and Val Morgan, which sells advertising on cinema screens and digital billboards.

The company was established by dentist Arthur Russell in Melbourne, Victoria in 1908, showing films in a hired hall. After expansion into other states and several changes of ownership, the majority of HOYTS was acquired by a Chinese conglomerate, the Wanda Group, in 2015. Presently, HOYTS owns and operates 60 cinemas, across Australia and New Zealand, covering 503 screens and more than 59,000 seats, including its newest cinema in Ipswich, making it one of Australia&#x27;s largest movie exhibitors.

==History==
=== 1909–1930 ===
At the start of the 20th century, Melbourne dentist and cornet player Arthur Russell bought a share in a small touring American circus that visited Melbourne, called HOYTS Circus. Russell toured with the circus as a magician, but it did not prove to be a financial success. In 1908, he started presenting moving pictures at St George&#x27;s Hall in Bourke Street, accompanying the silent films with his small family band: his wife on piano, son on drums, and Russell on cornet. On 18 September 1909 he opened HOYTS Picture Palace, and formed a company called HOYTS Pictures Pty Ltd. The old hall was rebuilt and renamed &quot;HOYTS De Luxe&quot;. By the end of World War I, HOYTS had expanded into the suburbs of Melbourne and into Sydney. The shows included vaudeville acts, as was common practice in those days.

In 1926, HOYTS and two other companies, Electric Theatres Pty. Ltd. and Associated Theatres Pty. Ltd., merged to become HOYTS Theatres Limited. In 1930, the Fox Film Corporation (now 20th Century Studios) acquired a majority of shares in HOYTS Theatres Ltd.

=== 1980s ===
In 1982, 20th Century Fox sold HOYTS to Stardawn Investments, a group of four Melbourne businessmen. In 1985, the Fink family subsequently bought out the other partners to become the sole owner. In 1987, the corporation was restructured and two of the companies in the corporation were listed on the Australian Securities Exchange: HOYTS Media and HOYTS Entertainment. However, the company that owned the cinemas, HOYTS Cinemas, was not floated until 1996. The years between 1987 and 1996 saw HOYTS expand in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In 1988, HOYTS bought out Interstate Theaters, which made its expansion into the United States market.

=== 1990s ===
Following Leon Fink&#x27;s death in 1993, the HOYTS organisation was sold to Hellman &amp; Friedman and Lendlease. The company eventually went public in 1995. In 1997, HOYTS expanded to Chile with the opening of its first movie theatre there. In 1999, Hoyts celebrated its 90th anniversary and was ranked the seventh largest cinema exhibitor in the world. In the same year, the late Kerry Packer&#x27;s private family company, Consolidated Press Holdings, bought the chain for $620 million. After that, HOYTS began to sell off international cinemas except for some New Zealand cinemas.

=== 2000s ===
In 2003, HOYTS sold all of its US chains to Regal Entertainment Group. In 2004, HOYTS joined forces with Village Roadshow and Amalgamated Holdings Limited to bail out Val Morgan Cinema Advertising, eventually taking their stake to 100% in 2005. In December that year, Publishing &amp; Broadcasting Limited and West Australian Newspapers purchased the company from Consolidated Press. In 2007, HOYTS was sold to Sydney-based private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners. The sale valued the company at A$440 million.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, HOYTS sold off its Chilean operations to . In the same year, HOYTS acquired Australian Multiplex Cinemas in Queensland and the Berkeley Cinema Group in New Zealand. HOYTS Stream, a video streaming service, was set to launch during 2013, but after being delayed, it was cancelled in 2014. Damian Keogh was appointed chief executive officer, and HOYTS was bought by Chinese billionaire Sun Xishuang through his investment company ID Leisure Ventures in December 2014.

In June 2015, Wanda Cinema Line, a subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group, purchased HOYTS from ID Leisure Ventures. 

In 2018, HOYTS Kiosk DVD vending machines were rebranded as Video Ezy after the group sold its subsidiary.

In Argentina HOYTS was acquired by Cinemark, in Chile by Cinépolis, and in Uruguay by Life Cinemas.

=== 2020s ===
In December 2022, HOYTS acquired three cinemas in WA from Grand Cinemas after the company went into administration. In April 2023, they acquired an additional cinema from Grand. That month, Wanda Film also began seeking buyers for Hoyts. The sale of Beijing Wanda Investment, which had a controlling stake in Wanda Film, to China Ruyi in December 2023 put any potential sale of Hoyts up in the air.

==Cinemas==

, HOYTS owns and operates 60 cinemas across Australia and New Zealand, with 503 screens and more than 59,000 seats, making it one of Australia&#x27;s largest movie exhibitors.

Features available at many HOYTS Cinemas include reclining chairs, large high-resolution screens under the &quot;Xtremescreen&quot; brand, and dine-in menus under the HOYTS &quot;Lux&quot; brand.
Seats that move and vibrate in synchronisation with on-screen action have been introduced at some cinemas using D-Box technology.

HOYTS Cinema Technology Group (CTG) was established in 2008 and helps other exhibitors such as Palace Cinemas install and operate digital cinema. HOYTS CTG also supports one-off screenings such as festivals or corporate events.

==Val Morgan==
Val Morgan was created by Valentine (Val) Morgan and specialises in advertising on cinema screens. Val Morgan&#x27;s sister company, Val Morgan Outdoor (VMO), operates advertising screens in shopping centres, gyms, service stations and office towers, as well as outdoor digital billboards.

== HOYTS Distribution ==
HOYTS Distribution was the film distribution arm of the group which existed in its own right from 1979 to 1994; it possessed the distribution rights to Cannon Films, Carolco and Nelson Entertainment films in Australia and New Zealand. The distribution unit was originally founded by Jim Shakespeare, the national sales manager of the company and Bill Gavin, general manager of films and marketing of the company. The company&#x27;s first films include &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot;, &quot;The Stud&quot;, &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;, &quot;Dawn!&quot; and &quot;Long Weekend&quot;.

It was later merged with the distribution operations of Columbia TriStar Film Distributors and 20th Century Fox, forming HOYTS -Fox-Columbia TriStar Films (later Fox-Columbia TriStar Films after HOYTS dropped out of the venture). In 1993, the entertainment branch of HOYTS was spun off to Television and Media Services, with the unit being renamed to TMS Distribution. The company&#x27;s original film library was sold off to Becker Entertainment in 1999. In 2001, the company was revived under the leadership of Kerry Packer, distributing primarily films produced by Nine Films and Television and major independent studios such as Lions Gate Entertainment.

HOYTS also operated a home video arm in concert with Sony, beginning in 1983 as RCA/Columbia/Hoyts Video Pty. Ltd. In addition to Columbia Pictures and TriStar fare through the main label, the company also held rights to Cannon and other releases via HOYTS , and starting in 1990, Orion Pictures releases via that company&#x27;s worldwide distribution deal with Columbia. RCA/Columbia/Hoyts (later renamed to Columbia TriStar/HOYTS Home Video) also released product through two alternative labels, First Release Home Entertainment and Video Box Office. HOYTS also had, beginning in 1988 a joint venture with PolyGram, HOYTS PolyGram Video; this label concentrated primarily on sell-through material, including PolyGram&#x27;s music video library. In 2004, the revived HOYTS Distribution partnered with MGM Home Entertainment and Universal Studios Home Entertainment to launch its own home video arm.

In 2012, HOYTS Distribution was sold to French production and distribution company StudioCanal and was rebranded under that banner the following year.

<text>The Marwat () is a Pashtun tribe, a branch of the Lohani tribe and belong to Lodi section. The Marwats were named for their ancestor Marwat Khan Lodi.

==Distribution==
They are located primarily in Lakki Marwat District, parts of Dera Ismail Khan District, Sara-e-Naurang Tehsil, Bannu District and Tank district in Pakistan, and in the Katawaz area of Paktika, Afghanistan.

==History==

:&quot;See also Bannu&quot;

Marwats, as well as other branches of Lohanis, lived in Zarghun Shar (located in the Paktika province) as well as Wana valley of South Waziristan. They had a long-standing dispute with Sulaiman Khels and other Ghilzais, who had already forced other Lodi tribes to migrate en masse to India. In one of the decisive battles, in the mid-15th century, Lohanis were thoroughly defeated by the Ghilzais, and had to leave Katawaz to the latter. Lohanis and their Dotani cousins had to be content with just Wana valley and surroundings.

The Marwat and other Lohanis expanded from Waziristan further east, occupying large tracts of present-day Dera Ismail Khan and Tank, by defeating Prangi, Suri and Sarwani tribes. Marwats stayed in Waziristan while Daulat Khels and Taturs migrated to newly conquered Daman. The headman of Kati Khel (branch of Daulat Khel), then the chief of all Lohanis, agreed to give shares in the income from the lands of Daman to Marwats and Miankhels. In the late 16th century, or in the beginning of the 17th century, Wazirs issued from their homeland Birmal and encroached upon the territories of Marwats in the nowadays South Waziristan (present day abodes of Ahmadzai Wazirs). Wazirs, with the aid of Mehsuds, defeated Marwats and Dotanis, the former were expelled while the latter was allowed to retain some lands in Wana. When the Marwats arrived in Daman to take possession of their lands, the Daulat Khel Lohanis opposed that. In the subsequent battle, the Daulat Khels were defeated by Marwats, and were expelled from Daman. The Daulat Khels sought the help of Gandapurs, Babars and Bhittanis, and this alliance was able to defeat the Marwats.

The defeated Marwats stayed in Dara Pezu and surroundings for some time, until they got the invitation from a section of Niazis, who were settled in present-day Lakki Marwat, to assist them in defeating the rival clan. Marwats turned against the Niazis. The Niazi clan first defeated the Marwat clan against whom they were hired and slaughtered them in great numbers. After the friendship with their brothers Marwats, Niazis fled towards Mianwali. Somewhere between 1601 and 1607, Marwats had taken possession of all the &#x27;Tal&#x27; tract.

Marwats were nominally part of Mughal empire. After decline of Mughals, the area came under Durranis. Ahmad Shah Abdali didn&#x27;t enforce taxes on Marwats but put the condition of providing contingents of Marwat warriors for his military campaigns. In the most important military campaign of Abdali, 120 Marwat horsemen accompanied him under their chief Begu Khan to India. Ahmad Shah&#x27;s successor, Timur Shah Durrani, enforced Tax on Marwats.

After the battle of Panipat, Marwats split into two factions, White and Black and fought each other for next 60 years. Taking advantage of their internal rift, Wazirs conquered some area from Marwats in the sandy tracts of the present day Bannu district. In 1819, Nawab of Mankera interested in the civil war of Marwats on the invitation of one party and later occupied the area for themselves. The weakened Marwats were unable to resist the occupation and thus Marwats lost the independence. Soon after, Sikhs conquered Lakki Marwat and built a fort on the bank of river Gambila near Present day Lakki city. In 1847 Marwats rose in rebellion against the Sikhs but it was successfully suppressed by the latter. In Anglo-Sikh Wars, Marwats provided great deal of help to British against the Sikhs. The relationship of some Marwat chiefs and British remained friendly for the most part, though some of Marwats joined Faqir of Ipi&#x27;s movement and fought for Pashtun freedom against British India in the Waziristan War.

<text>Russell Lissack is an English musician. He is the lead guitarist of London-based indie rock group Bloc Party, whom he founded with Kele Okereke in 1999. He released a self-titled album with side project Pin Me Down in 2010, and was a touring member of Ash from 2010 to 2011.

==Early life==
Lissack grew up in Chingford in East London. He had some piano lessons as a child, but did not pursue music until he began guitar lessons at age 16, soon meeting other musicians including Bloc Party co-founder Kele Okereke. He studied at Bancroft&#x27;s School and did A-levels at Epping Forest College before attending the London South Bank University.

Lissack said in 2010 that his interests would switch between dance music and rock music depending on the quality of each genre at any given time. He said that the late 1990s and late 2000s were periods that he found rock to be boring and followed dance music instead.

==Musical career==
===Bloc Party===
Lissack and Okereke formed Bloc Party at the Reading Festival in 1999, with the aim of mixing rock and dance. He dropped out of his sociology course to commit to the band, and did not inform his parents of this until the band were successful. The band released three albums and achieved four entries in the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart before entering hiatus in late 2009, to spend more time with their families.

In April 2011, Lissack announced that Bloc Party were recording new material. Between the release of &quot;Four&quot; (2012) and &quot;Hymns&quot; (2016), bassist Gordon Moakes and drummer Matt Tong left; Lissack said in 2015 that he did not see the band as any different, as he and Okereke were still composing in the same manner.

Lissack told &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2022 that the group&#x27;s compositions began with Okereke introducing a chord sequence or other idea, and Lissack adding to or adapting it. He said that effects pedals were the key part of his sound, and that he had used around a hundred of them on most recent album &quot;Alpha Games&quot;. Lissack used four distortion pedals for the introduction to &quot;Like Eating Glass&quot;, the opening song on debut album &quot;Silent Alarm&quot;. As with Okereke, Lissack&#x27;s primary instrument in a Fender Telecaster, that he bought from the United States in 2003 upon being signed by Wichita Recordings.

===Pin Me Down===
In 2010, during a hiatus in Bloc Party, Okereke began a solo career and Lissack released a self-titled album with his side project Pin Me Down, alongside American singer Milena Mepris. Lissack and Mepris met on Bloc Party&#x27;s first U.S. tour and began jamming to Weezer songs. The pair shared their respective music and lyrics by email when separated. Robert Cooke of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; praised Lissack as having &quot;the most imaginative guitar playing&quot; of Bloc Party&#x27;s generation but considered &quot;Pin Me Down&quot; to be too similar stylistically to the previous band&#x27;s work, including &quot;Silent Alarm&quot;.

Lissack said in 2015 that Pin Me Down were unlikely to collaborate again, as Mepris was working in television.

===Ash===
In March 2010, Lissack was announced as a touring member of Northern Irish rock group Ash. He had been a fan of the band as a child and had been in a band covering their music. In September, he was hospitalised after being bitten by a lion cub at a nature reserve on tour in South Africa. He left Ash in March 2011. He then told the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; that he was writing and producing for Japanese duo Heavenstamp, who had sent him music on Myspace.

<text>Longfield is a village in the Borough of Dartford, Kent, England. It is located 6 miles south east of Dartford and the same distance south-west of Gravesend.

==History==
The place in Kent is recorded as &quot;Langanfelda&quot; in the Saxon Charters of 964–995, and as &quot;Langafel&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086.

It had been proposed by town planner Patrick Abercrombie as part of the Greater London Plan in the mid-1940s to build a new town in the Longfield area, however other satellite areas around London were selected instead.

==Localities==
Longfield and New Barn is a civil parish named after the adjacent villages it covers, the eastern part being New Barn, it also covers the smaller settlement, the neighbourhood of Longfield Hill. Longfield is the ancient village, situated on the road between Dartford and Meopham; the historic church there is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. New Barn is larger in population than Longfield, although has little in the way of services, being a comparatively recent development and purely residential in nature.

==Topography==
Longfield is four miles south east of Dartford and near Gravesend. It is a linear development that is partly contiguous with the village of Hartley immediately to the south.

The whole civil parish gently slopes from southeast and south to north. Elevations range from 92m AOD in the southwest of the developed area of New Barn in the east which is on a wide rise, to 45m AOD in and around the chalk pit just west of Longfield across the largely disused HS1 south-of-London link railway line towards Southfleet (just north of the village). Just above this is the tiny settlement, a farmed area named Pinden, to the south, however before this on the road towards London is another named community, no more than a row of cottages on the road named Whitehill.

The villages of New Barn and Longfield are within and give their names to the civil parish of Longfield and New Barn which also covers the settlement of Longfield Hill. Longfield is the ancient village, situated on the road between Dartford and Meopham. New Barn is larger in population than Longfield, although has little in the way of services, being a recent development and purely a residential location.

==Governance==
Longfield fell within the Hundred of Axtane and its successor Dartford Rural District. The Local Government Act 1972 made the village part of the Sevenoaks district of Kent on 1 April 1974. It was transferred to the borough of Dartford on 1 April 1987 where it has remained since.

It has been in the Dartford parliamentary constituency since 1983.

Dr Howard Stoate (Labour), who had been the MP since 1997, decided not to stand again as a candidate at the 2010 general election. His successor candidate was defeated by Gareth Johnson (Conservative) at that election.

==Economy==
The village has a shopping area consisting of a local baker and butcher, two local supermarkets, a post office, chemist, estate agents, hair-dressers, an antiques shop, various restaurants and take-aways, a pet supply store, an undertakers and a country market on Fridays.

==Culture==
There is one pub in Longfield, the Railway Tavern. The Wheatsheaf, a 15th-century thatched pub, outside the village on the B255 road to Bluewater, closed down in 2011. The Long Valley Club and the Hartley Country Club are club-based venues restricted to paid membership. Other pubs in the area include the Green Man on Longfield Hill, the White Swan near Ash and the Rising Sun in Fawkham.

The church is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, and was built in 1343. It is a Grade II* listed building

==Transport==
===Rail===
Longfield railway station connects the village with Southeastern services to London Victoria via Bromley South, Ramsgate via Chatham and Dover Priory via Chatham and Canterbury East.

===Buses===
Longfield is served by Arriva Kent Thameside routes 433 &amp; 489 and Go-Coach routes 474 &amp; 475. These connect it with Bluewater, Gravesend and New Ash Green.

<doc id="1105480" wikidata="Q936659" url="?curid=1105480" title="Mushroomhead">
<text>Mushroomhead is an American heavy metal band from Cleveland, Ohio. Formed in 1993 in the Cleveland Warehouse District, the band is known for their avant-garde sound and horror film-inspired imagery which features masks and costumes as well as their unique live shows usually performed at smaller venues. They have sold over two million media units worldwide, and have released eight full-length albums and 35 music videos.

Since the band&#x27;s formation, Mushroomhead has experienced numerous lineup changes, with water drummer, keyboardist, DJ and visual designer Steve &quot;Skinny&quot; Felton being the sole consistent member. Other members include vocalists Steve Rauckhorst, Jackie LaPonza and Scott &quot;Strike&quot; Beck, guitarists Dave &quot;Gravy&quot; Felton and Joe &quot;Jenkins&quot; Gaal, bassist/keyboardist Ryan &quot;Dr. F&quot; Farrell, drummer Aydin Kerr, percussionist/water drummer Robbie &quot;Roberto Diablo&quot; Godsey and touring water drummer Jordan Gannon. Previous vocalists include Jeffrey Nothing, Jason &quot;J Mann&quot; Popson and Waylon Reavis.

==History==
===Debut album, &quot;Superbuick&quot; and &quot;M3&quot; (1993–2000)===
In 1993, Mushroomhead was established as a side project. To differentiate itself from the members&#x27; existing bands and to dispel any misconceptions about the group&#x27;s sound and musical content, Mushroomhead used costumes, masks, and pseudonyms. Mushroomhead played its first show in 1993. Days later, the octet found itself on stage alongside established metal band Gwar. &quot;We played our first show on a Saturday&quot; said the band&#x27;s drummer, Skinny, in an article for Mushroomhead&#x27;s official website. &quot;Three days later, we got a call to play with Gwar at the Cleveland Agora in front of 2,000 people – our second show ever!&quot;.

In 1995, Mushroomhead released a self-financed debut album, &quot;Mushroomhead&quot;, with their own record label, Filthy Hands Co. (previously known as Shroomco Records and later on, MRH Records). For the members, Mushroomhead became a priority with their original bands breaking-up. Although the line-up saw many changes throughout the 1990s, the band stayed active, steadily releasing music and gaining followers. In 1996, they released &quot;Superbuick&quot;. In 1999, Mushroomhead released &quot;M3&quot;, which was the final album self-financed and self-released by the band.

===&quot;XX&quot; and &quot;XIII&quot; (2000–2005)===
In 2000, Mushroomhead acquired a record deal with independent label Eclipse Records and in 2001 the band released their first ever label-released album; a re-recorded compilation release titled &quot;XX&quot;, which contains remixed/remastered versions of select songs from the first three Mushroomhead albums. Later in the year, after quickly selling almost 40,000 copies in just 2–3 months, the band signed with major label Universal Records and the compilation was re-released internationally. The release of the album led Mushroomhead to major national and international tours including Ozzfest 2002; as well as television exposure via their first music video &quot;Solitaire/Unraveling&quot;. Also in 2001, guitarist J.J. Righteous was replaced by one of the band&#x27;s previous stage dancers &amp; then current sampler, Marko Vukcevich. 2003 saw the release of &quot;XIII&quot;, their first album with new material for Universal Records. The album produced the single &quot;Sun Doesn&#x27;t Rise&quot; which was featured on &quot;MTV: Headbangers Ball&quot; and the &quot;Freddy vs Jason&quot; soundtrack. Also featuring the hidden track &quot;Crazy&quot;, a song originally by Seal. The album debuted at no. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 charts and sold 400,000 copies worldwide.

After an extensive world tour, vocalist J Mann announced he was leaving the band in August 2004, citing exhaustion and to take care of his sick father. He was replaced by Three Quarters Dead singer, Waylon. In August 2005, Mushroomhead self-released its first DVD on its own Filthy Hands label – &quot;Volume 1&quot;. Produced, directed, shot, and edited by the band, Volume 1 covers the band&#x27;s rise in the 2000s with live performances, music videos, and behind the scenes footage.

While on the road in 2005, Mushroomhead began the process of writing new material and recording a new album. In December 2005, Mushroomhead signed with Megaforce Records, ensuring the new album&#x27;s availability nationally and internationally. On June 6, 2006, Mushroomhead launched Mushroom Kombat – an interactive flash feature as a part of the band&#x27;s official website. The mini-game pits band members against each other in a Mortal Kombat-style environment, with each member having a unique fatality.

In 2005, Bronson announced that he was leaving the band to further his studies. Rather than recruiting another guitarist, the band decided to let Gravy do all the guitar parts for their new album. Gravy had said, &quot;it worked out really well, because Bronson wasn&#x27;t a natural [guitar] player. Now that he&#x27;s gone, I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore that my riffs will be too difficult for him to play.&quot; Since then, Mushroomhead continued with only one guitarist until Gravy&#x27;s return in 2022.

Mushroomhead headlined with Dope, Nocturne, and New Orleans locals Invain on the Music For Freedom Tour sponsored by Jägermeister at the House of Blues in New Orleans, Louisiana on Tuesday, August 16, 2005. This show was one of the last big acts to play in New Orleans for a long time due to Hurricane Katrina striking New Orleans on August 29, 2005.

===&quot;Savior Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children&quot; (2005–2012)===
&quot;Savior Sorrow&quot; was released on September 19, 2006, and debuted at No. 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts with sales exceeding 12,000. The band&#x27;s label stated that sales were closer to 25,000 with the inclusion of sales made while on tour. As a result, SoundScan issued an apology the day following the release of sales data due to mistakes made in estimates. The primary reason given was the lack of inclusion of sales from the Best Buy retailer chain. Sales of &quot;Savior Sorrow&quot; were roughly 26,000 and the chart entry place was closer to the No. 30 spot than No. 73. &quot;Savior Sorrow&quot;&#x27;s chart position was later officially adjusted to No. 50. &quot;Simple Survival&quot;, the pre-released single to &quot;Savior Sorrow&quot;, was placed at No. 39 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart one week after the release. Also in 2006, Daniel Fox (Lil&#x27; Dan) joined the band as a touring drummer.

The band has performed three shows on the Mayhem Festival tour, filling in for Bullet for My Valentine. Live footage was compiled into the band&#x27;s second DVD, titled &quot;Volume 2&quot;. On December 29, 2007, Mushroomhead won Video of the Year 2007 on the MTV2 Headbanger&#x27;s Ball for &quot;12 Hundred&quot; from the Savior Sorrow record. On September 17, 2008, it was announced that the band will release the &quot;Volume 2&quot; DVD on October 28 through Filthy Hands/Megaforce Records. The disc features two and a half hours of content, including live footage from the three-year Savior Sorrow tour, music videos including &quot;12 Hundred&quot;, &quot;Simple Survival&quot;, &quot;Burn&quot;, the short video for &quot;Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Save Us&quot; and &quot;Embrace the Ending&quot;, video commentary and behind the scenes footage. To support the DVD, Mushroomhead hit the road with The Autumn Offering, XFactor1, and Human Factors Lab from October 3 in Findlay, Ohio, until November 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the tour, Mushroomhead returned to the studio to record their next album.

They released &quot;Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children&quot; in September 2010. Within the first week of its release, it became the No. 1 best selling metal album on iTunes. A new song, &quot;Your Soul Is Mine,&quot; appeared on the &quot;Saw VI Soundtrack&quot;. On October 1, 2010, a music video for &quot;Come On&quot; debuted on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; on MTV. The video has since been barred from airing on MTV and other television outlets after being deemed too graphic by network censors. On October 28, 2010, the band&#x27;s founding guitarist, JJ Righteous, died of unknown reasons at the age of 41.

In October 2010, following the death of ex bandmate JJ Righteous, J Mann appeared on stage with the band during their Halloween show, performing vocals for two songs alongside both Jeffrey Nothing and Waylon. Both he and Waylon made a point of announcing that there were no hard feelings between the two of them, and that they are in fact on good terms with each other. On October 5, 2010, the Professional Wrestling Promotion known as TNA (Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) (Now called &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;) used their hit single &quot;Come On&quot; as the theme song to promote a match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley, a confrontation that was 20 years in the making. The promotional video can be seen on the TNA Wrestling official YouTube Channel. It is said that a longtime fan of the band put that together for them.

In February 2012, it was announced that guitarist Gravy and bassist Pig Benis would be replaced by Tommy Church and Ryan Farrell respectively. In April 2012, Dave &quot;Gravy&quot; Felton stated publicly on his Facebook fan page that he was &quot;kicked out of the band.&quot; In May 2012, Daniel &quot;Lil Dan&quot; Fox left Mushroomhead to work for another band. It was rumored that he is working as a drum technician for Marilyn Manson. On May 22, Dave Felton posted on his fan page an interview about his latest band. In the interview, he was asked about the Mushroomhead split. He said that he was kicked out via email and that it was the third time he had been told to leave. He said that he thought one of the reasons was because he did not have a party mentality (drinking and smoking) and that he thought it sometimes got in the way of band progress. The interview was on Uncensored Net Noise on the Msc Radio Network LLC. Drum tech Jeremiah Stratton (also known from Hed PE) had taken over Fox&#x27;s percussion parts in the Hed 2 Head Tour 3. After the Hed 2 Head Tour ended, drum tech Elliot Mapes took over Fox&#x27;s drum parts for live shows. People have jokingly called him &quot;Tall E&quot; in reference to Fox&#x27;s nickname being &quot;Lil Dan&quot;. On Thursday, August 16, 2012, Mushroomhead stated on their official Facebook fan page that former member Bronson would return on guitar for their 2012 &quot;Old School Show&quot;.

===&quot;The Righteous &amp; the Butterfly&quot; (2012–2019)===

In September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page. It was said by Mushroomhead frontman Jeff Hatrix that former Slipknot and current Painface vocalist Anders Colsefni is in the works to do a recording together in their upcoming studio sessions. The band entered their own Filthy Hands Studio in December 2012 to begin writing and recording their next studio album.

Their eighth album was the only one to showcase all three vocalists. Drummer Steve Felton described it as &quot;very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This is the first record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it&#x27;s going to go. For the old school fans there&#x27;s a lot of flavorful elements in it so they will definitely enjoy it.&quot;

On August 16, Jason Popson confirmed his return to the band via Facebook. Mushroomhead toured Australia for the first time as part of the Soundwave Festival 2014. On February 14, 2014, Mushroomhead released the date and name of their new album which will be released May 13, 2014 and the name of the new album is &quot;The Righteous &amp; the Butterfly&quot;. This album marks the return of J Mann. On April 15, 2014, Frontman Jeffrey Nothing released the band&#x27;s first unofficial single &quot;Qwerty&quot; on YouTube from his personal Facebook account. This marks the first song featuring J Mann since rejoining the band. The album received mostly positive reviews and is Mushroomhead&#x27;s first album to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Top 200 chart in the United States, reaching No. 20, selling around 11,000 copies the first week. The album also, reached No. 1 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Indie chart, their first album to do so. &quot;The Righteous &amp; the Butterfly&quot; reached No. 5 in the Top Rock Albums and No. 1 in the Top Hard Rock Albums. Mushroomhead have released an official music video for the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Out of My Mind&quot;. The band will be co-headlining the 2014 Shockfest Tour with Insane Clown Posse.

As of October 5, 2015, vocalist Waylon Reavis announced via his Facebook page that he had parted ways with Mushroomhead, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences with band ownership&quot; and stating he had &quot;severed all ties with Mushroomhead and Filthy Hands Company.&quot;

Mushroomhead went on a headlining UK tour in 2016, the first since 2002. American Head Charge was supposed to be their main support, but they ultimately decided to drop off the tour. A full European tour followed the next year.

On March 7, 2018, it was announced that vocalist and founding member Jeffrey &quot;Nothing&quot; Hatrix had parted ways with the band. Two days later, guitarist Tommy Church announced that he had also quit the band. On March 17, Popson&#x27;s Pitch Black Forecast bandmates and the band&#x27;s roadies Steve Rauckhorst and Tommy &quot;Tankx&quot; Shaffner were revealed as the new vocalist and guitarist respectively. Rauckhorst was a longtime friend, former neighbor and influence of the former vocalist.

On April 4, 2019, Mushroomhead announced that they had signed with Napalm Records.

In an interview during their UK tour in July 2019, drummer Felton and his wife, vocalist Jackie LaPonza revealed more information about the then forthcoming album, mentioning that during the tour they had recorded vocals at Abbey Road Studios and that the new album was 80% finished, with a tentative release date of April 2020. They confirmed that the new album cycle would also include new masks.

===&quot;A Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;Call the Devil&quot; (2020–present) ===
On April 21, 2020, it was announced the band&#x27;s new album was titled &quot;A Wonderful Life&quot; and would be released on June 19. It was also revealed that touring vocalist Jackie LaPonza (who has toured with the band since 2014) had officially joined the band on a full-time basis, adopting the alias, Ms. Jackie. The second single, &quot;The Heresy&quot; was released on May 26, 2020. The album was released on June 19 on schedule. Unfortunately, her tenure with the band was cut short as both she and Shaffner quietly left a year later. Joe &quot;Jenkins&quot; Gaal stepped in to replace the latter.

On Nov 1, the band teased two further music videos. A trailer stated that this collaboration with SK1 productions would have 2 story-based music videos, featuring all the members of the band, released back-to-back, with LaPonza having completely returned to the band by 2022.

In September 2022, Dave &quot;Gravy&quot; Felton rejoined Mushroomhead as the second guitarist, rather than replacing Joe &quot;Jenkins&quot; Gaal. By the end of 2022, vocalist Jason &quot;J Mann&quot; Popson departed for the second time, alongside Rick &quot;St1tch&quot; Thomas. Vocalist Scott &quot;x&quot; Beck joined as a vocalist. Drummer Steve &quot;Skinny&quot; Felton also took on keyboards, sampling and water drums as his live role. As such, live drums are performed by Aydin Kerr and Robbie &quot;Robbie Bobbie Shoes&quot; Godsey, with studio drums and percussion, as well as live percussion and water drums being shared between the three.

On June 13, 2024, the band released the single &quot;Fall in Line&quot; and announced their ninth studio album &quot;Call the Devil&quot;. It is advertised as a continuation of their accessible avant-garde style of the previous two albums as opposed to the heavier and more nu metal-influenced works of the Waylon era. On the same day, former vocalist Jeffrey Nothing teased the formation of &#x27;Jeffrey Nothing&#x27;s Mushroomhead&#x27; composed of other former members of the band, after previous vocalists such as Reavis and J Mann had resolved differences with the band. Therefore, confirmed members included only Church, Noah &quot;Shark&quot; Robertson and Marko &quot;Bronson&quot; Vukcevich.

On August 16, 2024, it was reported that Jeffrey Nothing had filed a lawsuit against Felton in regard to unpaid royalties and copyright infringement. Nothing&#x27;s attorney Ronald Stanley alleged that Felton had siphoned income under the alias of &#x27;Tenafly Viper&#x27; as well as an unknown publicist and unknown writer. Stanley claims Nothing is owed at least $3.5 million and is entitled to use of band insignia.

==Musical style and influences==
Mushroomhead&#x27;s sound combines elements of heavy metal, hip hop, experimental music, industrial music, gothic rock, punk rock and techno. The band has been categorized as alternative metal, industrial metal, nu metal, experimental metal, and electro-industrial.

They are influenced by bands such as Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Pink Floyd, Pantera, Nine Inch Nails, and KMFDM. In a 2014 interview with music journalist Greg Prato, Jason Popson reflected on the band&#x27;s musical influences, stating &quot;When you&#x27;re talking about a band with nine guys, you&#x27;re talking about tons of influences. I know when we started the band, we were really into a lot of the stuff Mike Patton was doing - Faith No More or Mr. Bungle, things like that. But we also liked heavier bands like Meshuggah, Pantera. Then there&#x27;s electronic stuff. So it&#x27;s really all over the map. It&#x27;s everything from hard rock to punk rock to hip-hop to electronica. It&#x27;s pretty vast.&quot;

==Artistry==
===Image and visuals===
The members of Mushroomhead have identified themselves by wearing masks and by its distinct &quot;X Face&quot; logo – commonly worn on the masks of most members, as well as clothing and merchandise. The band originally adopted masks and stage names to not conflict with their original bands. The band&#x27;s look has evolved over the years, featuring alterations to bring them up to date and freshen up the image for new albums and tours.
In January 2013, Mushroomhead Video Director, Maskmaker and Make-up artist Dave Henson Greathouse competed in season 4 of original SyFy series &quot;Face Off&quot;, a special effects prosthetic makeup reality show competition.
Another common visual trait that Mushroomhead is known for, are the use of water drums, which are performed by all the percussionists in the band.

===Relationship with Slipknot===

In the band&#x27;s early days, the group repeatedly saw accusations of plagiarism due to sharing a similar distinct visual performance to Iowan metal band Slipknot, but the Mushroomhead band members have heavily denied the claims of &quot;ripping off&quot; Slipknot and insist that they were instead the first to adopt the masked aesthetic.

As a result of the comparisons, Mushroomhead has had an on-and-off rivalry with Slipknot since at least 1999. The feud erupted mostly among fans of both bands. Before signing Slipknot, Roadrunner Records was interested in signing Mushroomhead, but Mushroomhead passed on the deal. As of 2009, the drama has ended and both bands currently maintain a close friendship.

Following the death of Slipknot member Paul Gray in 2010, Mushroomhead posted on their official Myspace page: &quot;R.I.P. Paul Gray, This feud needs to end. Much Love and Respect to the guys in Slipknot&quot;.

In 2012, Slipknot singer Corey Taylor has stated that he never had a problem with the band, he only had a problem with the behavior of their fans due to a situation Slipknot faced when they played in Mushroomhead&#x27;s home town in Cleveland, and said there was never a real feud between bands but the feud was between Mushroomhead fans and Slipknot fans. He stated that doing a tour with Mushroomhead, Gwar, and Mudvayne &quot;would be beautiful!&quot;. The same year, Mushroomhead members joined Slipknot&#x27;s Sid Wilson on stage in an impromptu performance during Wilson&#x27;s DJ set.

In 2014, singer Jeffrey &quot;Nothing&quot; Hatrix stated about the feud between the two bands: &quot;Fans are very loyal to the bands they like. Members of both sides have said they are over it and that it was never really between the bands. Let&#x27;s all move on&quot;.

<text>Vijay Dhondopant Tendulkar (6 January 1928 – 19 May 2008) was an Indian playwright, movie and television writer, literary essayist, political journalist, and social commentator primarily in Marathi. His Marathi plays established him as a writer of plays with contemporary, unconventional themes. He is best known for his plays &quot;Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe&quot; (1967), &quot;Ghashiram Kotwal&quot; (1972), and &quot;Sakharam Binder&quot; (1972). Many of Tendulkar&#x27;s plays derived inspiration from real-life incidents or social upheavals, which provide clear light on harsh realities. He has provided guidance to students studying &quot;play writing&quot; in US universities. Tendulkar was a dramatist and theatre personality in Maharashtra for over five decades.

==Early life==
Vijay Dhondopant Tendulkar was born in a Gaud Saraswat Brahmin family on 6 January 1928 in Girgaon, Mumbai, Maharashtra, where his father held a clerical job and ran a small publishing business. The literary environment at home prompted young Vijay to take up writing. He wrote his first story at age six.

He grew up watching western plays and felt inspired to write plays himself. At age eleven, he wrote, directed, and acted in his first play.

At age 14, he participated in the 1942 Indian freedom movement, leaving his studies. The latter alienated him from his family and friends. Writing then became his outlet, though most of his early writings were of a personal nature, and not intended for publication. During this period, he participated in the activities of Nabajiban Sanghatana, a splinter communist group. He said that he liked sense of sacrifice and discipline of the communists.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
Tendulkar began his career writing for newspapers. He had already written a play, &quot;Amchyavar Kon Prem Karnar?&quot; (), and he wrote the play, &quot;Grihastha&quot; (), in his early 20s. The latter did not receive much recognition from the audience, and he vowed never to write again.

Breaking the vow, in 1956 he wrote &quot;Shrimant&quot;, which established him as a good writer. &quot;Shrimant&quot; jolted the conservative audience of the times with its radical storyline, wherein an unmarried young woman decides to keep her unborn child while her rich father tries to &quot;buy&quot; her a husband in an attempt to save his social prestige.

Tendulkar&#x27;s early struggle for survival and living for some time in tenements (Chawl) in Mumbai provided him first-hand experience about the life of urban lower middle class. He thus brought new authenticity to their depiction in Marathi theatre. Tendulkar&#x27;s writings rapidly changed the storyline of modern Marathi theatre in the 1950s and the 60s, with experimental presentations by theatre groups like Rangayan. Actors in these theatre groups like Shriram Lagoo, Mohan Agashe, and Sulabha Deshpande brought new authenticity and power to Tendulkar&#x27;s stories while introducing new sensibilities in Marathi theatre.

Tendulkar wrote the play &quot;Gidhade&quot; () in 1961, but it was not produced until 1970. The play was set in a morally collapsed family structure and explored the theme of violence. In his following creations, Tendulkar explored violence in its various forms: domestic, sexual, communal, and political. Thus, &quot;Gidhade&quot; proved to be a turning point in Tendulkar&#x27;s writings with regard to establishment of his own unique writing style.

Based on a 1956 short story, &quot;Die Panne&quot; () by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Tendulkar wrote the play, &quot;Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe&quot; (). It was presented on the stage for the first time in 1967 and proved as one of his finest works. Satyadev Dubey presented it in movie form in 1971 with Tendulkar&#x27;s collaboration as the screenplay writer.

===1970s and 1980s===
In his 1972 play, &quot;Sakharam Binder&quot;, Tendulkar dealt with the topic of domination of the male gender over the female. The main character, Sakharam, is a man devoid of ethics and morality, and professes not to believe in &quot;outdated&quot; social codes and conventional marriage. He accordingly uses the society for his own pleasure. He regularly gives &quot;shelter&quot; to abandoned wives and uses them for his sexual gratification while remaining oblivious to the emotional and moral implications of his exploits. He justifies all his acts through claims of modern, unconventional thinking, and comes up with hollow arguments meant in fact to enslave women. Paradoxically, some of the women which Sakharam had enslaved buy into his arguments and simultaneously badly want freedom from their enslavement.

In 1972, Tendulkar wrote another, even much more acclaimed play, &quot;Ghashiram Kotwal&quot; (), which dealt with political violence. The play is a political satire created as a musical drama set in 18th century Pune. It combined traditional Marathi folk music and drama with contemporary theatre techniques, creating a new paradigm for Marathi theatre. The play demonstrates Tendulkar&#x27;s deep study of group psychology, and it brought him a Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship (1974–75) for a project titled, &quot;An Enquiry into the Pattern of Growing Violence in Society and Its Relevance to Contemporary Theatre&quot;. With over 6,000 performances thus far in its original and translated versions, &quot;Ghashiram Kotwal&quot; remains one of the longest-running plays in the history of Indian theatre.

Tendulkar wrote screenplays for the movies &quot;Nishant&quot; (1974), &quot;Akrosh&quot; (; 1980), and &quot;Ardh Satya&quot; (; 1984) which established him as an important &quot;Chronicler of Violence&quot; of the present. He has written eleven movies in Hindi and eight movies in Marathi. The latter include &quot;Samana&quot; (; 1975), &quot;Simhaasan&quot; (; 1979), and &quot;Umbartha&quot; (; 1981). The last one is a groundbreaking feature film on women&#x27;s activism in India. It was directed by Jabbar Patel and stars Smita Patil and Girish Karnad.

===1990s to 2008===
In 1991, Tendulkar wrote a metaphorical play, &quot;Safar&quot;, and in 2001 he wrote the play, &quot;The Masseur&quot;. He next wrote two novels – &quot;Kadambari: Ek&quot; and &quot;Kadambari: Don&quot; – about sexual fantasies of an ageing man. In 2004, he wrote a single-act play, &quot;His Fifth Woman&quot; – his first play in the English language – as a sequel to his earlier exploration of the plight of women in &quot;Sakharam Binder&quot;. This play was first performed at the Vijay Tendulkar Festival in New York in October 2004.

In the 1990s, Tendulkar wrote an acclaimed TV series, &quot;Swayamsiddha&quot;, in which his daughter Priya Tendulkar, noted Television actress of &#x27;Rajani&#x27; fame, performed in the lead role. His last screenplay was for &quot;Eashwar Mime Co.&quot; (2005), an adaptation of Dibyendu Palit&#x27;s story, &quot;Mukhabhinoy&quot;, and directed by theatre director, Shyamanand Jalan and with Ashish Vidyarthi and Pawan Malhotra as leads.

==Family==
He was the brother of acclaimed cartoonist and humourist Mangesh Tendulkar.

==Death==

Tendulkar died in Pune on 19 May 2008, battling the effects of the rare autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis.

Tendulkar&#x27;s son Raja and wife Nirmala had died in 2001; his daughter Priya Tendulkar died the next year (2002) of a heart attack following a long battle with breast cancer.

==Comment on Post-Godhra communal carnage==
Following the post-Godhra communal carnage in Gujarat in 2002, Tendulkar reacted by saying that &quot;If I had a pistol, I would shoot [Gujarat Chief Minister] Narendra Modi&quot;. This reaction of Tendulkar had evoked mixed reactions, local Modi supporters burning his effigies while others lauding his remark.

Later, when he was asked if it was not strange that he, who was known as a strong voice against death penalty, had a death wish for Modi, Tendulkar had said that &quot;it was spontaneous anger, which I never see as a solution for anything. Anger doesn&#x27;t solve problems.&quot;

==Legacy==
In his writing career spanning more than five decades, Tendulkar has written 27 full-length plays and 25 one-act plays. Several of his plays have proven to be Marathi theatre classics. His plays have been translated and performed in many Indian languages.

By providing insight into major social events and political upheavals during his adult life, Tendulkar became one of the strongest radical political voices in Maharashtra in recent times. While contemporary writers were cautiously exploring the limits of social realism, he jumped into the cauldron of political radicalism and courageously exposed political hegemony of the powerful and the hypocrisies in the Indian social mindset. His powerful expression of human angst has resulted in his simultaneously receiving wide public acclaim and high censure from the orthodox and the political bigwigs.

Many of Tendulkar&#x27;s plays derived inspiration from real-life incidents or social upheavals. Thus, the rise of Shiv Sena in Maharashtra in the 1970s was reflected in Tendulkar&#x27;s &quot;Ghashiram Kotwal&quot;. The true story of a journalist who purchased of a woman from the rural sex industry to reveal police and political involvement in this trade, only to abandon the woman once he had no further need for her, is detailed in Tendulkar&#x27;s &quot;Kamala&quot;. The play was later made into a film &quot;Kamla&quot;. 
The real-life story of an actress whose acting career got ruined after her same-sex affair became public knowledge inspired Tendulkar to write &quot;Mitrachi Goshta&quot;.

Tendulkar has translated nine novels, two biographies, and five plays by other authors into Marathi.

Besides the foregoing, Tendulkar&#x27;s oeuvre includes a biography; two novels; five anthologies of short stories; 16 plays for children, including &quot;Bale Miltat&quot; (1960) and &quot;Patlachya Poriche Lagin&quot; (1965); and five volumes of literary essays and social criticism, including &quot;Ratrani&quot; (1971), &quot;Kowali Unhe&quot; (1971), and &quot;Phuge Sobanche&quot; (1974). All in all, Tendulkar&#x27;s writings have contributed to a significant transformation of the modern literary landscape in Marathi and other Indian languages.

In 2005, a documentary titled &quot;Tendulkar Ani Himsa: Kal Ani Aj&quot; (&quot;Tendulkar and Violence: Then and Now&quot;) with English subtitles (produced by California Arts Association – CalAA - directed by Atul Pethe) was released. In 2007, a short film about Tendulkar, &quot;Ankahin&quot;, (director Santosh Ayachit) was released.

==Awards==
Tendulkar won Maharashtra State government awards in 1969 and 1972; and Maharashtra Gaurav Puraskar in 1999. He was honoured with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1970, and again in 1998 with the academy&#x27;s highest award for &quot;lifetime contribution&quot;, the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship (&quot;Ratna Sadasya&quot;). In 1984, he received the Padma Bhushan award from the Government of India for his literary accomplishments.

In 1977, Tendulkar won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay for his screenplay of &quot;Shyam Benegal&quot;&#x27;s movie, &quot;Manthan&quot; (1976). He has written screenplays for many significant art movies, such as &quot;Nishant&quot;, &quot;Akrosh&quot;, &quot;Ardh Satya&quot; and &quot;Aghaat&quot;.

<text>In abstract algebra, in particular in the theory of nondegenerate quadratic forms on vector spaces, the finite-dimensional real and complex Clifford algebras for a nondegenerate quadratic form have been completely classified as rings. In each case, the Clifford algebra is algebra isomorphic to a full matrix ring over R, C, or H (the quaternions), or to a direct sum of two copies of such an algebra, though not in a canonical way. Below it is shown that distinct Clifford algebras may be algebra-isomorphic, as is the case of Cl1,1(R) and Cl2,0(R), which are both isomorphic as rings to the ring of two-by-two matrices over the real numbers.

== Notation and conventions ==
The Clifford product is the manifest ring product for the Clifford algebra, and all algebra homomorphisms in this article are with respect to this ring product. Other products defined within Clifford algebras, such as the exterior product, and other structure, such as the distinguished subspace of generators &quot;V&quot;, are not used here. This article uses the (+) sign convention for Clifford multiplication so that
formula_1
for all vectors &quot;v&quot; in the vector space of generators &quot;V&quot;, where &quot;Q&quot; is the quadratic form on the vector space &quot;V&quot;. We will denote the algebra of matrices with entries in the division algebra &quot;K&quot; by M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) or End(&quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;). The direct sum of two such identical algebras will be denoted by , which is isomorphic to .

== Bott periodicity ==
Clifford algebras exhibit a 2-fold periodicity over the complex numbers and an 8-fold periodicity over the real numbers, which is related to the same periodicities for homotopy groups of the stable unitary group and stable orthogonal group, and is called Bott periodicity. The connection is explained by the geometric model of loop spaces approach to Bott periodicity: their 2-fold/8-fold periodic embeddings of the classical groups in each other (corresponding to isomorphism groups of Clifford algebras), and their successive quotients are symmetric spaces which are homotopy equivalent to the loop spaces of the unitary/orthogonal group.

== Complex case ==
The complex case is particularly simple: every nondegenerate quadratic form on a complex vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form
: formula_2
where , so there is essentially only one Clifford algebra for each dimension. This is because the complex numbers include &quot;i&quot; by which and so positive or negative terms are equivalent. We will denote the Clifford algebra on C&quot;n&quot; with the standard quadratic form by Cl&quot;n&quot;(C).

There are two separate cases to consider, according to whether &quot;n&quot; is even or odd. When &quot;n&quot; is even, the algebra Cl&quot;n&quot;(C) is central simple and so by the Artin–Wedderburn theorem is isomorphic to a matrix algebra over C. 

When &quot;n&quot; is odd, the center includes not only the scalars but the pseudoscalars (degree &quot;n&quot; elements) as well. We can always find a normalized pseudoscalar &quot;ω&quot; such that . Define the operators
: formula_3

These two operators form a complete set of orthogonal idempotents, and since they are central they give a decomposition of Cl&quot;n&quot;(C) into a direct sum of two algebras
: formula_4
where
: formula_5

The algebras Cl&quot;n&quot;&amp;pm;(C) are just the positive and negative eigenspaces of &quot;ω&quot; and the &quot;P&quot;&amp;pm; are just the projection operators. Since &quot;ω&quot; is odd, these algebras are mixed by &quot;α&quot; (the linear map on &quot;V&quot; defined by ):
: formula_6
and therefore isomorphic (since &quot;α&quot; is an automorphism). These two isomorphic algebras are each central simple and so, again, isomorphic to a matrix algebra over C. The sizes of the matrices can be determined from the fact that the dimension of Cl&quot;n&quot;(C) is 2&quot;n&quot;. What we have then is the following table:

The even subalgebra Cl(C) of Cl&quot;n&quot;(C) is (non-canonically) isomorphic to Cl&quot;n&quot;−1(C). When &quot;n&quot; is even, the even subalgebra can be identified with the block diagonal matrices (when partitioned into block matrices). When &quot;n&quot; is odd, the even subalgebra consists of those elements of for which the two pieces are identical. Picking either piece then gives an isomorphism with .

=== Complex spinors in even dimension ===
The classification allows Dirac spinors and Weyl spinors to be defined in even dimension. 

In even dimension &quot;n&quot;, the Clifford algebra Cl&quot;n&quot;(C) is isomorphic to End(C&quot;N&quot;), which has its fundamental representation on . A complex Dirac spinor is an element of Δ&quot;n&quot;. The term &quot;complex&quot; signifies that it is the element of a representation space of a complex Clifford algebra, rather than that is an element of a complex vector space.

The even subalgebra Cl&quot;n&quot;0(C) is isomorphic to and therefore decomposes to the direct sum of two irreducible representation spaces , each isomorphic to C&quot;N&quot;/2. A left-handed (respectively right-handed) complex Weyl spinor is an element of Δ (respectively, Δ).

=== Proof of the structure theorem for complex Clifford algebras ===
The structure theorem is simple to prove inductively. For base cases, Cl0(C) is simply , while Cl1(C) is given by the algebra by defining the only gamma matrix as .

We will also need . The Pauli matrices can be used to generate the Clifford algebra by setting , . The span of the generated algebra is End(C2).

The proof is completed by constructing an isomorphism . Let &quot;γ&quot;&quot;a&quot; generate Cl&quot;n&quot;(C), and formula_7 generate Cl2(C). Let be the chirality element satisfying and . These can be used to construct gamma matrices for Cl&quot;n&quot;+2(C) by setting for and for . These can be shown to satisfy the required Clifford algebra and by the universal property of Clifford algebras, there is an isomorphism .

Finally, in the even case this means by the induction hypothesis . The odd case follows similarly as the tensor product distributes over direct sums.

== Real case ==
The real case is significantly more complicated, exhibiting a periodicity of 8 rather than 2, and there is a 2-parameter family of Clifford algebras.

=== Classification of quadratic forms ===
Firstly, there are non-isomorphic quadratic forms of a given degree, classified by signature.

Every nondegenerate quadratic form on a real vector space is equivalent to an isotropic quadratic form:
: formula_8
where is the dimension of the vector space. The pair of integers (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is called the signature of the quadratic form. The real vector space with this quadratic form is often denoted R&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;. The Clifford algebra on R&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; is denoted Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(R).

A standard orthonormal basis {&quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;} for R&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; consists of mutually orthogonal vectors, &quot;p&quot; of which have norm +1 and &quot;q&quot; of which have norm −1.

=== Unit pseudoscalar ===

Given a standard basis as defined in the previous subsection, the unit pseudoscalar in Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(R) is defined as
: formula_9
This is both a Coxeter element of sorts (product of reflections) and a longest element of a Coxeter group in the Bruhat order; this is an analogy. It corresponds to and generalizes a volume form (in the exterior algebra; for the trivial quadratic form, the unit pseudoscalar is a volume form), and lifts reflection through the origin (meaning that the image of the unit pseudoscalar is reflection through the origin, in the orthogonal group).

To compute the square , one can either reverse the order of the second group, yielding sgn(&quot;σ&quot;)&quot;e&quot;1&quot;e&quot;2⋅⋅⋅&quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot;⋅⋅⋅&quot;e&quot;2&quot;e&quot;1, or apply a perfect shuffle, yielding sgn(&quot;σ&quot;)&quot;e&quot;1&quot;e&quot;1&quot;e&quot;2&quot;e&quot;2⋅⋅⋅&quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot;. These both have sign , which is 4-periodic (proof), and combined with , this shows that the square of &quot;ω&quot; is given by
: formula_10

Note that, unlike the complex case, it is not in general possible to find a pseudoscalar that squares to +1.

=== Center ===
If &quot;n&quot; (equivalently, ) is even, the algebra Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(R) is central simple and so isomorphic to a matrix algebra over R or H by the Artin–Wedderburn theorem.

If &quot;n&quot; (equivalently, ) is odd then the algebra is no longer central simple but rather has a center which includes the pseudoscalars as well as the scalars. If &quot;n&quot; is odd and (equivalently, if ) then, just as in the complex case, the algebra Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(R) decomposes into a direct sum of isomorphic algebras
: formula_11
each of which is central simple and so isomorphic to a matrix algebra over R or H.

If &quot;n&quot; is odd and (equivalently, if ) then the center of Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(R) is isomorphic to C and can be considered as a &quot;complex&quot; algebra. As a complex algebra, it is central simple and so isomorphic to a matrix algebra over C.

=== Classification ===
All told there are three properties which determine the class of the algebra Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(R):
* signature mod 2: &quot;n&quot; is even/odd: central simple or not
* signature mod 4: : if not central simple, center is or C
* signature mod 8: the Brauer class of the algebra (&quot;n&quot; even) or even subalgebra (&quot;n&quot; odd) is R or H
Each of these properties depends only on the signature modulo 8. The complete classification table is given below. The size of the matrices is determined by the requirement that Cl&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;(R) have dimension 2&quot;p&quot;+&quot;q&quot;.

It may be seen that of all matrix ring types mentioned, there is only one type shared by complex and real algebras: the type M2&quot;m&quot;(C). For example, Cl2(C) and Cl3,0(R) are both determined to be M2(C). It is important to note that there is a difference in the classifying isomorphisms used. Since the Cl2(C) is algebra isomorphic via a C-linear map (which is necessarily R-linear), and Cl3,0(R) is algebra isomorphic via an R-linear map, Cl2(C) and Cl3,0(R) are R-algebra isomorphic.

A table of this classification for follows. Here runs vertically and runs horizontally (e.g. the algebra is found in row 4, column −2).
=== Symmetries ===
There is a tangled web of symmetries and relationships in the above table.
: formula_12
Going over 4 spots in any row yields an identical algebra.

From these Bott periodicity follows:
: formula_13

If the signature satisfies then
: formula_14
(The table is symmetric about columns with signature ..., −7, −3, 1, 5, ...)

Thus if the signature satisfies ,
: formula_15

<doc id="1105498" wikidata="Q6517648" url="?curid=1105498" title="Legalized abortion and crime effect">
<text>A theory regarding the effect of legalized abortion on crime (often referred to as the Donohue–Levitt hypothesis) is a controversial hypothesis about the reduction in crime in the decades following the legalization of abortion. Proponents argue that the availability of abortion resulted in fewer births of children at the highest risk of committing crime. The earliest research suggesting such an effect was a 1966 study in Sweden. In 2001, Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago and John Donohue of Yale University, citing their research and earlier studies, argued that children who are unwanted or whose parents cannot support them are likelier to become criminals. This idea was further popularized by its inclusion in the book &quot;Freakonomics&quot;, which Levitt co-wrote.

Critics have argued that Donohue and Levitt&#x27;s methodologies are flawed and that no statistically significant relationship between abortion and later crime rates can be proven. Criticisms include the assumption in the Donohue-Levitt study that abortion rates increased substantially since the 1973 Supreme Court case &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;; critics use census data to show that the changes in the overall abortion rate could not account for the decrease in crime claimed by the study&#x27;s methodology (legal abortions had been permitted under limited circumstances in many states prior). Other critics state that the correlations between births and crime found by Donohue–Levitt do not adequately account for confounding factors such as reduced drug use, changes in demographics and population densities, or other contemporary cultural changes.

Part of the problem is the long and uncertain time lag between cause and effect. If increased abortion rates reduce crime among the cohort of children born during a particular year, the effect would only become apparent ten to twenty years later. To isolate the effect of abortion on crime, it is necessary to control for other factors that affect birth cohorts (e.g., relative cohort size or the prevalence of crime during childhood) and those that have immediate effects in later years (e.g., wage or incarceration rates).

==1972 Rockefeller Commission 12.16==

The 1972 Rockefeller Commission on &quot;Population and the American Future&quot; cites a 1966 study which found that children born to women who had been denied an abortion &quot;turned out to have been registered more often with psychiatric services, engaged in more antisocial and criminal behavior, and have been more dependent on public assistance.&quot; In particular, the study looked at the children of 188 women who were denied abortions from 1939 to 1941 at the hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. They compared these unwanted children to another group – the next child born after each of the unwanted children at the hospital. The unwanted children were more likely to grow up in adverse conditions, such as having divorced parents or being raised in foster homes and were more likely to become delinquents and engaged in crime.

==2001 Donohue and Levitt study==

Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago and John Donohue of Yale University revived discussion of this claim with their 2001 paper &quot;The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime&quot;. Donohue and Levitt point to the fact that males aged 18 to 24 are most likely to commit crimes. Data indicates that crime in the United States started to decline in 1992. Donohue and Levitt suggest that the absence of unwanted children, following legalization in 1973, led to a reduction in crime 18 years later, starting in 1992 and dropping sharply in 1995. These would have been the peak crime-committing years of the unborn children.

According to Donohue and Levitt, states that had legalized abortion before &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (Alaska, California, Hawaii, New York, Oregon, and Washington), also had earlier reductions in crime. Further, states with a high abortion rate experienced a greater reduction in crime, when corrected for factors like average income. Finally, studies in Canada and Australia claim to have established a correlation between legalized abortion and overall crime reduction.

===Initial criticism===
The study was criticized by various authors, including John Lott and John Whitley, who argued that Donohue and Levitt assume that states which completely legalized abortion had higher abortion rates than states where abortion was only legal under certain conditions (many states allowed abortion only under certain conditions prior to &quot;Roe&quot;) but that CDC statistics do not substantiate this claim. In addition, if abortion rates cause crime rates to fall, crime rates should start to fall among the youngest people first and then gradually be seen lowering the crime rate for older and older people. In fact, they argue, the murder rates first start to fall among the oldest criminals and then the next oldest criminals and so on until it last falls among the youngest individuals. Lott and Whitley argue that if Donohue and Levitt are right that 80 percent of the drop in murder rates during the 1990s is due solely to the legalization of abortion, their results should be seen in some graphs without anything being controlled for, but the opposite is true. In addition, Lott and Whitley pointed out that using arrest rate data as a proxy for crime rates is flawed because arrest for murder can take place many months or even years after the crime occurred. Lott and Whitley claim that using the Supplemental Homicide Report, which links murder data for when the crime occurred with later arrest rate data, reverses Donohue and Levitt&#x27;s regression results. A 2004 study by Ted Joyce concluded that the negative association between legalized abortion and crime rates reported in Donohue and Levitt&#x27;s study was actually due to unmeasured period effects from, among other factors, changes in crack cocaine use. In 2009, Joyce reported similar, negative results after analyzing age-specific homicide and murder arrest rates in relation to the legalization of abortion across U.S. states and cohorts.

In 2005 Levitt posted a rebuttal to these criticisms on the &quot;Freakonomics&quot; weblog, in which he re-ran his numbers to address the shortcomings and variables missing from the original study. The new results are nearly identical to those of the original study. Levitt posits that any reasonable use of the data available reinforces the results of the original 2001 paper. A 2004 study by Donohue and Levitt addressed Joyce&#x27;s criticisms, showing that a negative correlation still exists if the range of years examined were extended beyond those analyzed by Joyce, and the effects of the crack epidemic were adequately controlled.

===2005 criticism by Foote and Goetz===
Later in 2005, Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz claimed that a computer error in Levitt and Donohue&#x27;s statistical analysis led to an artificially inflated relationship between legalized abortion and crime reduction. Once other crime-associated factors were properly controlled for, they claimed that the effect of abortion on arrests was reduced by about half. Foote and Goetz also criticize Levitt and Donohue&#x27;s use of arrest totals rather than arrests per capita, which takes population size into account. Using Census Bureau population estimates, Foote and Goetz repeated the analysis using arrest rates in place of simple arrest totals, and found that the effect of abortion disappeared entirely.

Donohue and Levitt subsequently published a response to the Foote and Goetz paper. They acknowledged the mistake, but showed that with different methodology, the effect of legalized abortion on crime rates still existed. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal showing that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They conceded that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt&#x27;s thesis, however, and emphasized that with data this messy and incomplete, it may not even be possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt&#x27;s conclusion.

===2007 Reyes leaded gasoline theory===

A 2007 study by Jessica Reyes at Amherst College stated:

===Later studies===
A 2007 study by Leo H. Kahane, David Paton, Rob Simmons found no clear, consistent relationship between abortion and crime in England and Wales.

A 2014 study by Paolo Buonanno, Francesco Drago, Roberto Galbiati, and Giulio Zanella studied seven European nations, finding no evidence for the Donohue-Levitt hypothesis. However a 2014 study by Abel Francois analyzed data from 16 countries in western Europe for 1990-2007, finding that abortion caused a significant decrease in crime rates.

A 2017 study by Gary L. Shoesmith concluded that &quot;if there is a significant link between crime and abortion, it is due to varying concentrations of teenage abortions across states, not unwantedness.&quot; In other words, legalized abortion reduced crime in the 1990s as the Donohue-Levitt hypothesis indicated, but purely because it reduced the number of teenage mothers, not some broader effect of reducing all unwanted pregnancies.

In 2019 Donohue and Levitt published an updated review of the debate over their original study, concluding that its predictions held up strongly. &quot;We estimate that crime fell roughly 20% between 1997 and 2014 due to legalized abortion. The cumulative impact of legalized abortion on crime is roughly 45%, accounting for a very substantial portion of the roughly 50–55% overall decline from the peak of crime in the early 1990s.&quot; Levitt discussed this paper and the background and history of the original paper (including its criticisms) in an episode of the Freakonomics podcast, with Reyes saying that, from her perspective &quot;both stories are true&quot;.

<doc id="1105504" wikidata="Q424581" url="?curid=1105504" title="Metol">
<text>Metol (or Elon) is a trade name for the organic compound with the formula [HOC6H4NH2(CH3)]2HSO4. It is the sulfate salt of &quot;N&quot;-methylaminophenol. This colourless salt is a popular photographic developer used in monochrome photography.

==Synthesis and degradation==
Several methods exist for the preparation of &quot;N&quot;-methylaminophenol. It arises by decarboxylation of &quot;N&quot;-4-hydroxyphenylglycine (Glycin). It can be obtained by reaction of hydroquinone with methylamine.

Being an electron-rich arene, metol is readily degraded by hydrogen peroxide.

==Application==
Metol is an excellent developing agent for most continuous tone developer applications, and it has been widely used in published developer formulas as well as commercial products. However, it is difficult to produce highly concentrated developer solutions using Metol, and therefore most Metol developers are supplied in dry chemical mix. A developer containing both Metol and hydroquinone is called an MQ developer. This combination of agents provides greater developer activity since the rate of development by both agents together is greater than the sum of rates of development by each agent used alone (superadditivity). This combination is very versatile; by varying the quantities of Metol, hydroquinone, and restrainer, and adjusting the pH, the entire range of continuous tone developers can be made. Therefore, this form of Metol replaced most other developing agents except for hydroquinone, Phenidone (which is more recent than Metol), and derivatives of Phenidone. Notable formulas include Eastman Kodak D-76 film developer, D-72 print developer, and D-96 motion picture negative developer.

==History==
Alfred Bogisch, working for a chemical company owned by Julius Hauff, discovered in 1891 that methylated &quot;p&quot;-aminophenol has more vigorous developing action than &quot;p&quot;-aminophenol. Hauff introduced this compound as a developing agent. The exact composition of Bogisch and Hauff&#x27;s early Metol is unknown, but it was most likely methylated at the ortho position of the benzene ring (&quot;p&quot;-amino-&quot;o&quot;-methylphenol), rather than at the amino group. Some time later, Metol came to mean the &quot;N&quot;-methylated variety, and the &quot;o&quot;-methylated variety fell out of use. Aktien-Gesellschaft für Anilinfabrikation (AGFA) sold this compound under the trade name Metol, which became by far the most common name, followed by Eastman Kodak&#x27;s trade name Elon.

Because it has been in use for this purpose for over 100 years, and often by amateur photographers, there is a substantial body of evidence regarding the health problems that contact with Metol can cause. These are principally local dermatitis of the hands and forearms. There is also some evidence of sensitization dermatitis.

<text>Chronological Bible Storying (CBS) is a method of orally communicating portions of the Bible by telling its stories aloud to listeners in chronological order. For people who are illiterate, or members of pre-literate societies, CBS presents the Bible as oral literature in a narrative format in an attempt to make it easier to understand and remember. 

==Overview==
The CBS stories are presented in what is regarded as Biblical chronological order in an attempt to allow the listener to connect the stories together to form one frame of reference regarding the Bible rather than just a series of unrelated stories.

CBS has its roots in Chronological Bible Teaching (CBT), which involves telling Biblical stories intermixed with teaching about the themes, significance, and message of the story. This form was popularized by Trevor McIlwain and used extensively by New Tribes Mission since the 1970s. McIlwain&#x27;s influence on John R. Cross led him to write &quot;The Stranger on the Road to Emmaus&quot;, which presented the Bible in a chronological format. CBT proponentes argue that the Bible and biblical theology is best understood when one studies the content beginning in Genesis, studying stories, events, and themes in the order and context in which they took place. CBT is closely related to Biblical Theology, and is often encouraged as an alternative, or complement to Systematic Theology.

CBS is unlike CBT in that it explicitly avoids mixing the stories with teaching. Instead, CBS seeks to present Biblical stories as directly as from scripture as possible with minimal explanation. Theological truths are better understood in oral cultures within the concrete example of a story rather than abstract principles present in literate teaching styles. 

CBS attempts to present a comprehensive overview of the Bible that provides the necessary background pre-literate people with no previous exposure to the Christianity need to understand Jesus Christ and the gospel. CBS is often used for evangelization, discipleship, and church planting as a way to establish an organized church within illiterate cultures, generally with the long-term goal of promoting literacy and translating the Bible into a language the group can be taught to read.

<text>Black Rocks (or Stonnis Rocks), is a small outcrop of ashover gritstone, between Cromford and Wirksworth in Derbyshire, the Peak District, England. It is an important crag in the history of British rock climbing, and has some of the most extreme climbing routes in Britain, including Gaia E8 6c.

==Climbing history==
The crag has been a well-known traditional climbing venue since the 1890s, and features in the early 1913 guidebook, &quot;Some Gritstone Climbs&quot;. Black Rocks has some easier traditional climbing routes of grades Diff to VS 4c, and a selection of short bouldering problems of grades to , however, it is most noted for its historic extreme traditional climbing routes put up in the mid-1980s to the early 2000s. Its northerly aspect means that it is frequently in damp condition (and even covered in green algae), however, the sandstone-like gritstone rock dries reasonably quickly.

Important names in British climbing history have left their mark at Black Rocks such as James W. Puttrel (&quot;Stonnis Crack&quot; HVS 4b, 1900), Fred Pigott (&quot;Sand Buttress&quot; VS 4c, 1920), and Peter Harding (&quot;Demon Rib&quot; E4 5c, 1949, and &quot;Promontory Traverse&quot; E1 5b, 1945).

The two best-known Black Rocks climbs are &quot;Gaia&quot; (E8 6c, 5.13a X), whose first free ascent was by Johnny Dawes in 1986), and &quot;Meshuga&quot; (E9 6c, 5.13a X), whose first free ascent was by Seb Grieve in 1997), which are located on the main overhanging promontory section. Both climbs are featured in several climbing films including &quot;Stone Monkey&quot; (1988) capturing Dawes first ascent of &quot;Gaia&quot;, &quot;Hard Grit&quot; (1998) in which French climber Jean-Minh Trin-Thieu takes a large fall on &quot;Gaia&quot;, and &quot;Dosage Volume 4&quot; (2006), in which American climber Lisa Rands made the first female ascent of &quot;Gaia&quot;. In 2008, American climbers Kevin Jorgeson and Alex Honnold, both completed free solos of &quot;Meshuga&quot;, while Honnold also completed the first-ever flash of &quot;Gaia&quot;.

In November 2000, Charlie Woodburn completed a direct finish to &quot;Gaia&quot; called &quot;Harder, Faster&quot;, and graded it E9 7a; a fall from the crux near the top would likely be fatal, and it is thus considered one of the most dangerous climbs in Britain, and rarely repeated, with only its third ascent in December 2020.
