<text>Tattletales is an American game show produced by Goodson-Todman Productions in association with Fremantle. The program had two runs on the CBS daytime schedule between February 1974 and June 1984. It was hosted by Bert Convy, with several announcers including Jack Clark, Gene Wood, Johnny Olson and John Harlan providing the voiceover at various times. Wood was the primary announcer during the show&#x27;s first run, and Olson was announcing during the 1980s.

The show&#x27;s premise involved questions asked about celebrity couples&#x27; personal lives and was based on &quot;He Said, She Said&quot;, a syndicated Goodson-Todman show hosted by Joe Garagiola that aired during the 1969–70 season, which in itself was based on an unsold 1966 pilot called &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; that was hosted by Ed McMahon, which featured four regular couples who were not celebrities.

==Host==
Bert Convy was awarded a Daytime Emmy Award for hosting the show in 1977. Convy and his wife, Anne, occasionally played the game during the 1970s run, most often during weeks in which the panel was made up entirely of other game show hosts and their spouses. Among the hosts who filled in for Convy during these episodes were Gene Rayburn, Bob Barker, Bobby Van, Jack Narz and Richard Dawson. All five hosts also participated in playing the game along with other hosts such as Allen Ludden, Monty Hall, Bill Cullen and Chuck Woolery.

==Game play==
The show changed its format after its first four months on the air. The second format remained for the rest of the show&#x27;s run, including its latter versions.

Production for &quot;Tattletales&quot; was set up at Hollywood&#x27;s Television City in either Stages 31, 41, 43. In both formats, the show&#x27;s set consisted of two parts. One was a desk behind which three players could sit. The other was a small seating area in the upstage right corner of the stage, which was used to keep the players not in the game isolated; a sliding wall covered the seating area during game play and each player had a set of headphones to block out any noise from the other side of the wall. Usually, the game began with the husbands isolated and the wives onstage. When needed, the offstage players would appear on monitors in front of their spouses.

The studio audience was divided into three color-coded sections: red, yellow (which Convy jokingly nicknamed the &quot;banana section&quot;), and blue, each section of 100 members rooting for one celebrity couple. Audience members in each section divided the money their respective couples won. The couple with the most money at the end of the show won the game, earning their section a $1,000 bonus. In the event of a tie, the winning sections divided the $1,000 bonus. A member of the winning section was also randomly drawn to win additional prizes. Audience members received their winnings in checks distributed as they left the studio.

===Format No. 1===
In the first format, Convy asked the players onstage two questions, which usually started with &quot;It happened at...&quot; or &quot;A story involving...&quot; and then Convy completed the question. After each question was read, a player onstage buzzed-in to answer the question. That player then gave a one- or two-word clue that the spouse would recognize. Convy then repeated the question to the offstage players, appearing on the monitors in front of their spouses, followed by the clue. The offstage player who buzzed in first answered the question, and if the couple&#x27;s answers matched, they won money for their rooting section.

A correct answer was worth $100 with a one-word clue, and $50 with a two-word clue. Convy then asked another question, usually multiple choice, called a &quot;Tattletale Quickie,&quot; to each couple in-turn. On their turn, each onstage player answered the question, and the spouse appeared and answered the same question. If the answers matched, the team won $100. The players changed places in the second round.

===Format No. 2===
In June 1974, the game dropped the first type of question, and questions in the &quot;Tattletale Quickies&quot; format were used for the entire show (though the &quot;Quickies&quot; name was dropped). The scoring format also changed. Each question had a pot of $150, split among all couples who matched ($50 if all three matched, $75 if two matched and $150 if only one couple matched). If no one matched, the amount of the pot was added to the next question. The husbands were first asked two questions, after which the players changed places prior to the second round. The wives were then asked two more questions, with the value of the final question doubled to $300. In addition to the same scoring format, on syndicated episodes one member of the winning rooting sections chosen at random received six different parting gifts.

==Broadcast history==
CBS placed &quot;Tattletales&quot; at 4:00 PM (Eastern Time Zone)/3:00 PM (Central Time Zone/Mountain Time Zone/Pacific Time Zone) when it premiered, replacing the long-running soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;. It formed the last third of an afternoon game show block that also included &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;Match Game &#x27;74&quot;.

The show changed time slots three times in 1975. On June 16, CBS moved it to 11:00/10:00 AM. On August 11, after &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; returned to the morning, &quot;Tattletales&quot; moved to 3:30/2:30 PM. On December 1, it returned to its original time slot.

On December 12, 1977, CBS moved &quot;Tattletales&quot; to the 10:00/9:00 AM in a scheduling shuffle with &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;Match Game &#x27;77&quot;. &quot;Tattletales&quot; gradually began to lose viewers and ran its 1,075th and final show of the original version on March 31, 1978. It was replaced by &quot;Pass the Buck&quot;. A weekly nighttime version, syndicated by Firestone aired during the 1977–78 season, but was not renewed.

In 1981, CBS asked Mark Goodson to bring &quot;Tattletales&quot; back, and it returned on January 18, 1982. It aired at 4:00/3:00 PM until June 1, 1984, when it was replaced by another Goodson show, &quot;Body Language&quot;.

On March 12, 2021, the streaming service HBO Max announced that it had ordered a reboot of &quot;Tattletales&quot;, which would be produced by Ayesha and Stephen &quot;Steph&quot; Curry, and feature celebrity couples playing for charity. Fremantle stated that the reboot would also feature physical challenges and viewer-submitted questions. However, on August 23, 2021, it was announced that the show would be retitled to &quot;About Last Night&quot;, with an initial premiere set for fall 2021. In January 2022, it was announced that it would premiere on February 10, 2022. In August 2022, the series was removed from HBO Max.

==Episode status==
Both versions of &quot;Tattletales&quot; remain intact, but only a portion have been seen on Game Show Network: episodes of the CBS run from 1974 to 1977, selected episodes from the CBS run from 1977 to 1978, and several months of the 1982–84 run. GSN never reran the nighttime syndicated version. Episodes of the 1974–1977 daytime version of Tattletales can currently be seen on Buzzr.

Two episodes of the nighttime syndicated version aired on Buzzr on February 9, 2020, as part of their &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; marathon.

==International versions==
An Australian version of &quot;Tattletales&quot; aired on the Seven Network as &quot;Celebrity Tattle Tales&quot;, hosted by Ugly Dave Gray for a brief time in 1980, and was produced by Reg Grundy. The show was cancelled after being on the air for only three months. Each of the first five questions was worth $60 with one $120 question to follow.

A Brazilian version of &quot;Tattletales&quot; ran on Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão from 1975 to 1986 under the name &quot;Ela Disse, Ele Disse&quot; (&quot;She said, He said&quot;) hosted by Silvio Santos.

==In popular culture==
A spoof of the show aired on a 1977 episode of &quot;SCTV&quot;; called &#x27;Celebrity TattleTales&#x27;, the segment (a commercial for the show) featured Prince Philip (Joe Flaherty) and Queen Elizabeth (Catherine O&#x27;Hara) being asked a question by Bert Convy (played by Eugene Levy).

<text>James Arthur Ernst (born November 19, 1942) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a municipal councillor in Winnipeg from 1973 to 1986 and a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1997. From 1988 to 1997, Ernst was a Cabinet minister in the government of Premier Gary Filmon.

The son of Frank Luther Ernst and Stella Sarah Bryson, he was born in Winnipeg and was educated at St. Paul&#x27;s College (affiliated with the University of Manitoba). He worked as a real estate and insurance broker before entering public life. Ernst was elected as a councillor in the amalgamated City of Winnipeg in 1973, and served as the city&#x27;s deputy mayor from 1981 to 1986. During his time in municipal politics, Ernst was associated with the Independent Citizens&#x27; Election Committee, an unofficial alliance of right-wing business interests in the city.

In 1967, he married Dorothy Lynn Blom.

Ernst left municipal politics to run for the provincial legislature in the 1986 Manitoba general election. He was elected in the southwest Winnipeg riding of Charleswood as a Progressive Conservative, defeating his closest opponent by almost 4,000 votes. The seat had been vacated by former premier Sterling Lyon&#x27;s retirement from electoral politics. The governing New Democratic Party (NDP) was narrowly re-elected, and Ernst joined 25 other Conservatives in opposition.

In March 1988, disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding brought down the government. The resulting election took place at a time when the Manitoba Liberal Party was making inroads into both PC and NDP areas of support; Ernst was only narrowly re-elected, defeating Liberal candidate Shari Nelson by fewer than 1,000 votes.

The Conservatives, led by Gary Filmon, formed a minority government following this election. On May 9, 1988, Ernst was appointed Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, with responsibility for Development Corporation, Sport, the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and Manitoba Forestry.

The provincial Liberals had slipped in popularity by the provincial election of 1990, and Ernst was returned in Charleswood with minimal difficulty. After a cabinet shuffle on February 5, 1991, he was named Minister of Urban Affairs and Minister of Housing. After a further shift on September 10, 1993, he was named Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Government House Leader, once again receiving responsibility for Sport, the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act, the Boxing and Wrestling Commission and (until May 9, 1995) the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation Act.

Ernst and the Conservative government were convincingly re-elected in 1995. He was removed from cabinet following a shuffle on January 6, 1997, and resigned from the legislature that October 28.

After leaving politics, Ernst was appointed Vice-President of Optx 2000, a research and development firm. He has also served as Chief Executive Officer of the Team Canada Volleyball Centre, and presided over the elimination of that organization&#x27;s debt in 2002.

<doc id="1112560" wikidata="Q6652650" url="?curid=1112560" title="Little and Large">
<text>Little and Large were a British comedy double act comprising straight man [[Syd Little]] (born Cyril John Mead; 19 December 1942) and comic [[Eddie Large]] (born Edward Hugh McGinnis; 25 June 1941 – 2 April 2020). 

==Comedy duo==
They formed their partnership in 1962, originally appearing as singers in local pubs around north-west England. According to an interview with Eddie Large in &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper (11 January 2019), they went professional in October 1963. Originally performing under their real names, they started using the names &quot;Little and Large&quot;. The origin of their name comes from the fact that Syd Little was skinny, contrasting to the girthy Eddie Large. 

By the 1970s, the two were contemplating on whether or not to give up comedy and make a living in their normal day jobs, or continue with comedy; deciding to concentrate on comedy, Little and Large&#x27;s big break came in 1971 when they appeared on ITV talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. They won the programme&#x27;s vote, turning them into household names virtually overnight.

Within five years, the duo had their own prime-time show on ITV called &quot;The Little and Large Tellyshow&quot;. It began with a pilot episode in 1976, which earned the pair a commission for a series in 1977. However, the duo transferred to BBC1 with a new show called &quot;The Little and Large Show&quot; from 1978, and remained on the channel for over a decade until its cancellation in 1991. At its peak, the series was watched by an estimated nearly 15 million people each week.

Eddie Large was generally the funny man while Syd Little was the more serious &#x27;straight guy&#x27;. Eddie Large performed a number of impressions, particularly cartoon characters like Popeye, Deputy Dawg, Fred Flintstone, Barney Rubble and Woody Woodpecker, while Syd Little simply stood next to him, looking perplexed and distressed. Large&#x27;s onstage catchphrase (to describe Little) was &quot;Supersonic&quot;.

Eddie Large was told he might have a heart attack at any moment. The partnership split up when Large had to have a heart transplant.

Syd Little performed on cruise ships, such as the &quot;QE2&quot;, during September 2007, and used to run The &quot;Little&quot; Restaurant at the Strawberry Gardens pub and now runs a restaurant in the oldest pub in his home town Fleetwood, called The Steamer.

Eddie Large remained in showbusiness. Large said in a 2010 interview he had not spoken to Syd Little for several years. They did subsequently have a reunion in 2018 when they appeared on &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, featuring in the sketch serial &quot;Saturday Knight Takeaway&quot;, and in February 2019, appearing together on &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;. They reached the head-to-head round (in effect, the semi-final).

On 2 April 2020, Eddie Large died after contracting coronavirus while receiving treatment for heart failure. Large had suffered from kidney and heart problems for a number of years .

<text>Edward Hugh McGinnis (25 June 1941 – 2 April 2020), better known by the stage name Eddie Large, was a British comedian. He was best known as one half of the double act Little and Large, with Syd Little (the stage name of Cyril Mead).

==Early life== 
Large was born Edward Hugh McGinnis in Glasgow in 1941. His father Teddy served as a Petty Officer in the Royal Navy during World War II and after he returned from the war the family moved to a tenement in Oatlands. When he was nine years old, the family moved again to Manchester, where he attended Claremont Road Primary School and a grammar school. He played football as a schoolboy, becoming a supporter of nearby Manchester City which had its ground opposite his home, and he maintained a lifelong devotion to the club. After he left school, he worked as an electrician and was a singer.

==Little and Large==

Large met singer and guitarist Cyril Mead in the Stonemason&#x27;s Arms pub in Timperley and they formed a double act following the reaction to Eddie&#x27;s comic heckling of Cyril, who switched to comedy. The duo then performed in northern clubs, turning professional in 1963. As Little and Large, the two men began their television career on the talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; winning in 1971 and starred in many television comedy programmes, including their own series &quot;The Little and Large Show&quot; and the ITV series &quot;Who Do You Do?&quot; doing impressions and also performing as pantomime stars.

In an interview in 2010, Large said that he and Syd Little had not spoken to each other for several years. During the 2010–11 football season, football entertainment show &quot;Soccer AM&quot; produced comedy sketches with Peterborough footballer Mark Little, and Eddie Large, as the newly reformed Little and Large.

==Later career==
Large worked on the after-dinner circuit and, in the latter years of his life, performed some cameo acting roles in dramas such as &quot;The Brief&quot; and &quot;Blackpool&quot;. His autobiography, entitled &quot;Larger than Life&quot;, was published in 2005. In 2013, Large released his first single without Little, a parody of &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot; by Serge Gainsbourg entitled &quot;Gee Musky... Moi Non Plus&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Large married his first wife, Sandra Baywood, in 1965. The marriage ended in divorce, with Large marrying his second wife, Patsy Scott, in 1983. Large lived in Portishead, near Bristol, with his wife Patsy and 26-year-old son. He also had two daughters and three grandchildren.

After being admitted to hospital in March 2002 due to kidney problems, Large underwent a heart transplant at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge in 2003 at the age of 62, and recovered fully. Large was hospitalised for some weeks in late 2013 after tripping over a road sign near his Portishead home.

Large died on 2 April 2020, aged 78 at Southmead Hospital in Bristol after contracting coronavirus while receiving treatment for heart failure. Large had suffered from kidney and heart problems for a number of years. Large&#x27;s funeral took place at South Bristol Crematorium on 24 April 2020, in Bristol, with Syd Little in attendance, who said that Large was his &quot;best friend&quot;.

<text>WrestleMania X8 (also known as WrestleMania 18) was the 18th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on St Patrick’s Day, March 17, 2002, at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the second WrestleMania at that venue after WrestleMania VI in April 1990. The event marked the final WrestleMania event held under the WWF name and the Attitude Era, as the company entered the Ruthless Aggression Era in April and renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) a month later. It was also the last WrestleMania held before the introduction of the brand extension just a week after the event. The record-breaking attendance for the SkyDome of 68,237 grossed approximately $6.1 million CAD ($3.9 million USD). WrestleMania weekend also included WWF Fan Axxess at the Canadian National Exhibition&#x27;s Automotive Building.

Eleven matches were contested at the event. The Rock defeated Hollywood Hulk Hogan in the main attraction dubbed &quot;Icon vs. Icon&quot;, while in the final match, Triple H defeated Chris Jericho to win the Undisputed WWF Championship. In other prominent matches on the undercard Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Scott Hall, The Undertaker defeated Ric Flair in a no disqualification match, and Rob Van Dam defeated William Regal to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship.

== Production ==
=== Background ===
WrestleMania is considered the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of the WWF&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; PPVs, along with King of the Ring. WrestleMania 18, stylized as WrestleMania X8, was scheduled to be held on March 17, 2002, at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, marking the second WrestleMania at that venue after WrestleMania VI in April 1990.

=== Storylines ===

The main feud built up in the lead to the event pitted The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin against the New World Order (Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) with the main attraction being promoted as The Rock vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan, billed as an Icon vs. Icon, face of the company generational match.

The Rock&#x27;s involvement with the nWo started after his win over The Undertaker at No Way Out, when a photo request from Hogan for his son turned into a trade of insults. On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock interrupted Hogan&#x27;s address to the crowd and challenged Hogan to a match at WrestleMania. When Hogan accepted and shook hands with his future opponent, The Rock kept the hold on and hit the &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; on Hogan. Before The Rock could leave the arena, Hall and Nash ambushed The Rock. Hogan, Nash, and Hall then attacked The Rock with a belt, a hammer, and all three of their finishers, concluding the assault by spray painting the nWo initials on The Rock&#x27;s back. With medics attending to The Rock and loading him into an ambulance van, the nWo furthered the attack by forcing the medics to retreat, chaining up all possible exits of the van, and driving a semi-truck into the van with The Rock trapped inside. Stone Cold Steve Austin&#x27;s involvement also commenced at No Way Out, when after having their gift of beer refused, the nWo interfered with Austin&#x27;s Undisputed WWF Championship match against Chris Jericho, helping Jericho to retain the title before spray painting the nWo initials on Austin&#x27;s back. Austin finally got his revenge on the February 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when, after the nWo had given a half hearted apology for their attack on The Rock, he chased the nWo out of the ring with a tire iron. Austin managed to catch Hall and attack him with the tire iron, but Hogan and Nash saved Hall from being run over by Austin&#x27;s pickup truck. After the nWo found their limousine spray-painted &quot;What?&quot; by Austin, the latter kidnapped Hall and closed the show by embarrassing him in the middle of the ring with &quot;3:16&quot; spray-painted on his back. On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hall challenged Austin to a match at WrestleMania which Austin accepted afterward. The feud between Austin and the nWo continued back and forth for the next couple of weeks with Austin attacked by Hall twice with a cinder block and a wrench, while Austin fired a netgun at Nash before beating down Hall. On the March 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Rock made his return and immediately challenged Hogan for a fight. Nash and Hall held Hogan back, leaving Hall to challenge for a match instead. Rock&#x27;s match with Hall ended in a three-on-one attack by the nWo. The nWo&#x27;s attack was stopped by Austin, however, who saved The Rock with the aid of a steel chair. On the March 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Rock and Austin took on the nWo in a handicap match, resulting in Hogan pinning The Rock after a leg drop.
The secondary feud leading into WrestleMania X8 involved Triple H against the Undisputed WWF Champion Chris Jericho and Stephanie McMahon. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho defeated The Rock to retain the Undisputed WWF Championship on the same event where Triple H earned his opportunity to compete for the Undisputed WWF Championship at WrestleMania by winning the Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Kurt Angle. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H interrupted Jericho and warned that he would prove him that he&#x27;s worthy enough to be in the main event. Meanwhile, some hostility between Triple H and his wife Stephanie was starting to show, with the face Triple H tired of Stephanie&#x27;s heel characteristics. In order to recover their relationship, Stephanie suggested on &quot;Raw&quot; that the two should renew their wedding vows on the following week. At first Triple H refused, but Stephanie revealed that she was pregnant, making him change his mind. To further prove it, the two met a doctor on the next episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; with ultrasound images. On the February 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; just before the wedding, Triple H was met with a phone call by his mother-in-law Linda McMahon, who had sent him a video tape revealing that the doctor was in fact an actor and that Stephanie was not pregnant. At the wedding, Triple H turned on Stephanie and attacked her along with her father Mr. McMahon, saying that their marriage was now over. During these weeks, Kurt Angle was given a match with Triple H&#x27;s WrestleMania title shot on the line at No Way Out. In revenge for the ruined wedding, Mr. McMahon granted Stephanie the chance to be the special guest referee for the match. At No Way Out, with clear bias from Stephanie, Angle defeated Triple H for the title shot. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, WWF co-owner Ric Flair granted Triple H a rematch with Stephanie barred from the ring, enabling him to regain his title shot at Chris Jericho. On the February 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jericho met with Stephanie and put their differences in the past, ending with Stephanie accepting Jericho&#x27;s proposal to be his new business partner. To further the feud, Jericho later speculated that he ended the marriage by causing Triple H&#x27;s quadriceps muscle to (legit) tear during their WWF Tag Team Championship match on the May 21, 2001 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, thus diverting Triple H&#x27;s attention to his wife. Under the divorce settlement for the two, the assets would be split between them &quot;fifty-fifty&quot; to Stephanie&#x27;s disgust. Among the assets were Triple H&#x27;s first wrestling robe, Stephanie&#x27;s Corvette (which Triple H later gave to her with half of it cut off) and Triple H&#x27;s bulldog Lucy. Stephanie managed to win Lucy in the settlement and later on the March 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; sent Jericho to walk the dog. Displeased about this, Jericho tied Lucy to a limousine and ordered the unknowing driver to buy some air fresheners, running Lucy over into a critical condition by accident. Wanting retribution, Triple H stormed into the arena and tried to attack Stephanie, but he was met with two sledgehammer shots to his recovered leg by Jericho. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Stephanie noted that the sledgehammer shots had left Triple H&#x27;s quad in a condition that one false move in his WrestleMania match could reinjure his quadriceps once again. At the end of the show, Triple H and Jericho had a brawl in the ring that almost ended with a &quot;Pedigree&quot; on Stephanie. However, Jericho saved her and locked the &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot; on Triple H, leaving the show with the advantage.

Another major feud for WrestleMania X8 was the rivalry between The Undertaker and the WWF co-owner, Ric Flair. The feud started over The Undertaker&#x27;s ambush on The Rock during the buildup to No Way Out, with Undertaker giving The Rock a chokeslam and a &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; onto a car. Shortly afterward, Ric Flair openly detested The Undertaker&#x27;s actions. At the No Way Out event, Flair interfered with Undertaker&#x27;s match against The Rock, finally hitting Undertaker with a lead pipe to aid The Rock in victory. Far from pleased over this result, The Undertaker challenged Flair to a match at WrestleMania. Flair refused, stating that he is an owner and no longer a wrestler. However, Undertaker tried to convince Flair by attacking select members of Flair&#x27;s friends and family. Following a match on the February 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair&#x27;s friend Arn Anderson was ambushed by The Undertaker during his road agent duties. The Undertaker followed this the following week by attacking Flair&#x27;s son David, threatening that the rest of Flair&#x27;s children would follow. Upon this attack, Flair accepted the match on the March 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Later that night, the two ended up brawling into the audience, resulting in Flair punching out a fan by accident. As a result, Flair was arrested to Undertaker&#x27;s delight. On the March 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Flair&#x27;s rival co-owner Mr. McMahon asked for an emergency board meeting with the WWF board of directors citing that Flair&#x27;s attack of a fan was unacceptable and that either he or Flair should have absolute authority and power over the company. With Flair still keen on taking on Undertaker at WrestleMania, CEO Linda McMahon had no choice but to give Vince total control over the company. Despite this, Linda also stated that the ownership situation would also be reviewed after WrestleMania with a final decision. To add further insult, Mr. McMahon booked David Flair in a match against The Undertaker on the March 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. The Undertaker almost gave David a &quot;Last Ride&quot;, but was stopped by Ric Flair who saved his son with some steel chair shots.

== Event ==

Before the pay-per-view event aired began, Mr. Perfect, Lance Storm and Test faced Rikishi, Scotty 2 Hotty and Albert in six-man tag team match on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;. Rikishi won the match for his team after pinning Mr. Perfect following a &quot;Banzai Drop&quot;.

The actual pay-per-view started with a live performance of &quot;Superstar&quot; by rock band Saliva (Josey Scott, Wayne Swinny, Chris D&#x27;Abaldo, Dave Novotny and Paul Crosby). After that, William Regal defended his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Rob Van Dam. Twice in the match, Regal tried to use brass knuckles to set up the &quot;Power of the Punch&quot; on Van Dam, but on both occasions Van Dam kicked them away. Van Dam won the match after a &quot;Five-Star Frog Splash&quot; to win his first Intercontinental Championship.

The WWF European Championship match between the champion Diamond Dallas Page and Christian followed. Christian executed a neckbreaker on Page and Page performed a roll-up on Christian but neither man scored a pinfall. Page won the match after a &quot;Diamond Cutter&quot; on Christian.

The WWF Hardcore Champion Maven defended his title against Goldust in a Hardcore match. The match ended when both Goldust and Maven knocked each other out with trashcan lids. Spike Dudley came out and pinned Maven for a three count. Under the title&#x27;s 24/7 rules, Spike became the new champion. His celebration was short-lived, as Crash Holly chased Spike through the crowd with Maven and Goldust following suit. In a promotion for the show&#x27;s main event, rock band Drowning Pool (Dave Williams, C. J. Pierce, Stevie Benton and Mike Luce) made a live performance of &quot;Tear Away&quot; with a video package playing in the background. After the performance, the show cut to backstage where Crash Holly and Spike Dudley continued to fight. Al Snow tried to interfere by driving a golf cart (along with referee Theodore Long) towards the two but ended up crashing into some boxes. Spike successfully fought off Holly by throwing him into a steel door, but ended up getting kicked by The Hurricane who swung off a rope. The Hurricane then pinned Spike to become the new Hardcore Champion.

Next, Kurt Angle fought Kane. During the match, Angle executed Kane&#x27;s signature flying clothesline. Confidently, Angle tried another, but Kane countered with a clothesline of his own. Later on, Kane attempted a &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot;, but Angle grabbed Kane&#x27;s mask, distracting him enough for Angle to execute an &quot;Angle Slam&quot;. Angle applied the ankle lock on Kane, which was stopped when Kane reached the ropes. With Angle still holding the foot, Kane used the other foot to perform an enzuigiri. A top rope attack by Kane was prevented when Angle rushed to the corner and executed a belly to belly suplex on him. Kane tried a chokeslam but Angle reversed it into a roll-up using the ropes to win the match.
After that, Ric Flair took on The Undertaker in a no disqualification match. The match started with a brawl outside the ring with Flair&#x27;s back getting smashed into the ring post. The Undertaker tried Old School but Flair pulled him down. Later, Flair locked The Undertaker in a figure-four leglock, which The Undertaker countered by executing a chokeslam. Arn Anderson interfered and executed a spinebuster on The Undertaker. Flair pinned The Undertaker for a near-fall and The Undertaker locked Anderson in a Dragon sleeper but Flair hit The Undertaker with a chair. The Undertaker retaliated with a big boot and failed to perform a &quot;Last Ride&quot; attempt due to exhaustion, but The Undertaker executed the &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; on Flair and pinned him for the win. The Undertaker then acknowledged his WrestleMania winning streak for the first time by holding up his hands with his fingers outstretched to show his ten straight wins.

In the sixth match, Edge faced Booker T. Booker T gained the advantage early on in the match. However, Edge recovered by countering Booker T&#x27;s top rope attack with a hurricanrana and followed this up with a spinning heel kick off the top rope. Booker T executed a &quot;Scissors Kick&quot;, for a near-fall while Edge delivered a spear for a near fall. After performing his own version of Booker T&#x27;s Spinaroonie, Edge won the match with an &quot;Edgecution&quot;. Backstage, The Hurricane was interviewed by Jonathan Coachman about winning the Hardcore Championship. The Hurricane&#x27;s sidekick, Mighty Molly, appeared and suggested the two should go to their Hurri-Cycle. Just as The Hurricane headed to that direction, Molly smashed a frying pan onto the back of his head and pinned him to become the new Hardcore Champion.

Next, Stone Cold Steve Austin wrestled Scott Hall. With Kevin Nash in Hall&#x27;s corner, Austin was left having to fend off both wrestlers. The nWo&#x27;s teamwork enabled Hall to give Austin an Irish whip into an exposed turnbuckle. Austin executed a &quot;Stunner&quot; on Hall but Nash pulled the referee out of the ring to break the count and attacked Austin. Austin delivered a Stunner to both Nash and Hall but another pin attempt on Hall was prevented when Nash elbow dropped the second referee. Hall&#x27;s &quot;Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; attempt was reversed by Austin into a back drop outside of the ring. Eventually, Nash was forced to leave the stadium by WWF officials. Hall then executed a stunner on Austin for a near-fall but Austin retaliated with two stunners for the win.
After that, a four corners elimination match pitted for the WWF Tag Team Champions, Billy and Chuck, against the APA, The Dudley Boyz, and The Hardy Boyz. For the Dudleys&#x27; entrance, Saliva performed their theme, &quot;Turn the Tables&quot;, live. The APA were quickly eliminated when D-Von Dudley pinned Bradshaw following a &quot;3D&quot; from both Dudleys. The Dudleys then set up a table outside. Stacy Keibler, valet for the Dudley Boyz, tried to distract Jeff Hardy, by showing him her thong, but Hardy spanked and kissed her before shoving her off the ring apron. The Dudleys tried to go for a &quot;Whassup&quot; headbutt, but Billy pushed D-Von off the top rope, sending him crashing through the table outside. Bubba Ray Dudley was then given a &quot;Twist of Fate&quot; by Matt Hardy followed by a &quot;Swanton Bomb&quot; from Jeff. Matt then covered Bubba Ray to eliminate The Dudley Boyz. Billy and Chuck retained their titles when Billy hit Jeff with one of the tag team title belts, enabling Chuck to pin him. Backstage, the battle for the Hardcore Championship continued when Mighty Molly ran straight into the top half of a dutch door shutting. Christian then pinned her to win the title.

In the main attraction, The Rock faced Hollywood Hogan in a match dubbed as &quot;Icon vs. Icon&quot;. Despite The Rock portraying a face and Hogan a heel, the Canadian crowd cheered Hulk Hogan over The Rock instead. During the match, The Rock applied the Sharpshooter but the referee was down and unable to acknowledge a submission. The Rock released the hold and tried to revive the referee, but Hogan hit a low blow and a &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; for a near-fall. The two tried their respective finishers, the &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; and the leg drop, but each kicked out. After two more &quot;Rock Bottoms&quot; and a &quot;People&#x27;s Elbow&quot;, The Rock pinned Hogan and won the match. After the match, the two shook hands with respect. As The Rock left the ring, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall came and attacked Hogan, ending Hogan&#x27;s involvement in the nWo. The Rock returned and saved Hogan from further attack. As a sign of respect, The Rock stopped Hulk from leaving the ring and asked him to pose for the crowd, turning Hogan into a face for the first time since 1999. Hogan gave an interview in 2013 which indicated that he and The Rock changed the thrust of the match on the fly based on the crowd&#x27;s response.

In the penultimate match Jazz defended the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship in a triple threat match against Trish Stratus and Lita. Near the end of the match, Trish attempted a &quot;Stratusfaction&quot; but Lita threw her out of the ring. With Lita by the corner, Jazz followed and delivered a fisherman superplex, allowing her to pin Lita and retain the title. At the parking lot, Christian was getting ready to leave the stadium in a taxi. However, Maven pulled Christian out and quickly pinned him to win the Hardcore Championship. Maven then hopped into the taxi and left, leaving him the final Hardcore Champion of the night.
In the final match of the evening, Chris Jericho defended the Undisputed WWF Championship against Triple H. For his entrance, Triple H had Drowning Pool perform their version of his theme song, &quot;The Game&quot;, live. With Triple H&#x27;s leg bandaged, both Jericho and Stephanie McMahon gave numerous shots at the leg during the match. Triple H outsmarted the two by dodging Jericho&#x27;s attack, causing him to collide with Stephanie, who was standing on the apron. Outside the ring, Triple H went for the &quot;Pedigree&quot; on Jericho through an announce table but Jericho countered into a back body drop through the Spanish announce table. Stephanie tried to hit Triple H with a chair when referee Earl Hebner interceded. Stephanie pushed Hebner aside but was met by a &quot;Pedigree&quot; from Triple H. Jericho then struck Triple H in the head with the chair while Hebner was attending to Stephanie for an unsuccessful pinfall attempt. Jericho then tried a &quot;Pedigree&quot; on Triple H, but the latter reversed it into a catapult into the turnbuckle. Triple H executed the &quot;Pedigree&quot; on Jericho and pinned him to win the title.

== Reception ==
WrestleMania X8 was met with a generally positive critical reception. Writing for SLAM! Wrestling, John Powell gave the overall event 7 out of 10 stars, which was a lower rating than the previous year&#x27;s event. The main event between Chris Jericho and Triple H for the Undisputed WWF Championship received the highest rating out of all the matches on the card of 8 out of 10 stars, the match between The Rock and Hollywood Hogan received a rating of 7 out of 10 stars, the match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Scott Hall received a rating of 6 out of 10 stars, the no disqualification match between The Undertaker and Ric Flair was rated 7.5 out of 10 stars and the four corners elimination match for the WWF Tag Team Championship between Billy and Chuck, The APA, The Hardy Boyz, and The Dudley Boyz being rated 5 out of 10 stars.

According to Chris Jericho, he tried to not be the last match of the card despite being the Undisputed WWF Champion. According to him, the true main event was Rock vs. Hogan and Triple H and he could not follow that match. The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan match would go on to be well praised over the years as one of the most iconic wrestling matches ever, as well as being named Pro Wrestling Illustrated&#x27;s match of the year 2002. Mike Chioda expressed his thoughts on the match, stating, &quot;Did I know it was gonna be so legendary back then? Hell no, I didn’t know. I didn’t know a few years later. We thought something was gonna at some point top that, and I don’t think at some point since 2002, since Rock and Hogan, has really topped that.&quot; Cody Rhodes considers it the greatest match ever.

== Aftermath ==

After WrestleMania, the WWF board of directors made their final decision over the control of the company. Due to the conflicts between Mr. McMahon and Ric Flair making bad business, Linda McMahon proposed a brand extension, essentially splitting the entire WWF roster into two separate entities, named after their two major television shows, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Vince took control of the SmackDown! brand while Flair controlled the Raw brand. A draft was held with each owner would get a total of thirty picks between the wrestlers. The draft was held on the March 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, while the brand extension officially began on April 1.

Triple H&#x27;s feud with Stephanie McMahon would conclude on the March 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when he defeated her and Chris Jericho in a triple threat match for the Undisputed WWF Championship. By pinning her, Stephanie was forced to leave the WWF in accordance with the match stipulations. Triple H&#x27;s feud with Jericho would continue with Jericho and The Undertaker interfering with Triple H&#x27;s championship match at Backlash against Hollywood Hulk Hogan and costing him the Undisputed WWF Championship. Triple H would finish his feud with Jericho in a Hell in a Cell match at Judgment Day and challenged The Undertaker for the Undisputed WWE Championship at King of the Ring, but lost after interference from the returning Rock.

After the reaction during his return match, Hollywood Hulk Hogan was quickly turned face. Until the brand extension separated both parties, The Rock and Hogan feuded with Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, with Nash and Hall having had expelled Hogan from the nWo. On the final &quot;SmackDown!&quot; before the brand extension, the team of The Rock, Hogan and Kane defeated Nash, Hall and new nWo member X-Pac in a six-man tag match. The Rock left shortly after the WWF draft for three months to go on a media tour to promote his movie, &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;.

Stone Cold Steve Austin no-showed the following two weeks, claiming to be burned out. When he returned, on the April 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the show was centered on which brand he would choose. Both McMahon and Flair would attempt to win his signature, with Austin eventually choosing the Raw brand. After being drafted to Raw, Austin would get himself involved in the feud between The Undertaker and Ric Flair, fighting The Undertaker at Backlash for an Undisputed WWF Championship shot, which he would lose. The storyline itself evolved into a feud between Austin and Flair, with the nWo&#x27;s involvement on Flair&#x27;s behalf.

WrestleMania X8 was the last WrestleMania held before the introduction of the brand extension on March 25, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown! brands, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. It was also the last WrestleMania held under the WWF name, as the company was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May.

<text>River Oaks Elementary School is a magnet school, and neighborhood school, part of the Houston Independent School District. It is located in the River Oaks neighborhood of Houston, Texas, United States , William Dedrick is the principal.

It houses one of several gifted and talented programs, referred to as &quot;Vanguard&quot; programs, in Houston ISD. The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Where discovery is elementary&quot;. Its mascot is the roadrunner.

River Oaks Elementary School has an accelerated multidisciplinary curriculum. It became one of the first three elementary schools in Texas to get authorization for the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (the primary school division of the IB program) during the 2002 - 2003 school year, and the curriculum was changed accordingly during the same school year.

==History==
===Early history===
River Oaks Elementary was designed by architect Harry D. Payne, who, in 1926, arrived in Houston after being hired by the Houston Independent School District to design the school. Payne gave the same floor plan to River Oaks, Briscoe, Field, Henderson, Poe, and Wharton elementaries. He insisted on giving each school a unique exterior. Payne said that River Oaks&#x27; design was one of his favorite designs. Landscaping architect William M. Anderson created the landscaping plans. The River Oaks Corporation provided the land that the school was built on, which was worth $50,000; the corporation wanted the school to be built as soon as possible, so it sold the land at half price to HISD.

Ima Hogg, Mrs. Agnese Carter Nelms, and Mrs. Pat Houstoun originally considered founding a private school, but after they approved of the philosophy of HISD superintendent Edison Oberholtzer, they supported his efforts. Since HISD distributed most of its funds to junior and high schools, the &quot;Supplementary Aids committee&quot; founded by Hogg and the other women funded a furnished library for River Oaks. Hogg, HISD officials, and a group of mothers selected Eva Margaret Davis as the school&#x27;s first principal. Estelle Sharp, Hugh Potter, and the Hoggs created a telephone campaign which had River Oaks mothers make telephone calls to persuade Edison E. Oberholtzer, the HISD superintendent, into modeling the school&#x27;s education program after John Dewey&#x27;s ideals. River Oaks opened in 1929.

As the school grew, more classrooms were added. First permanent additions were built. Later temporary buildings were set up on the school grounds. In 1974 most of River Oaks was assigned to River Oaks Elementary School.

River Oaks Elementary was originally an all-White school; it was desegregated in 1970. The &quot;ESG&quot; (Elementary School for the Gifted) program was established shortly afterwards. It was not the first magnet program in Houston, as High School for the Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA) was the first.

Prior to desegregation, River Oaks Elementary had around 800 children. After desegregation, many parents removed their children from River Oaks Elementary, and the school was far below capacity. River Oaks became exclusively a public magnet school in 1986; during the previous school year a total of 60 students were residents of the River Oaks neighborhood. At the time River Oaks had mainly older families. At the time the remaining families who did have children had the money to send their children to private school and preferred to do so.

From 1986 to 1995, up to 50% of the houses in River Oaks had changed ownership. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary had a waiting list, and it became one of the most prestigious public elementary schools in Houston. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school.

===Vanguard and neighborhood program controversy===
On March 2, 1995, HISD board trustee Ron Franklin introduced a request by the River Oaks neighborhood to have a neighborhood school at the board table. Parents from River Oaks pressured the school into adding back a neighborhood program. Some Vanguard parents felt concern with the proposal, because they liked the Vanguard program and feared that introducing neighborhood children would adulterate the Vanguard program, believing that River Oaks parents would use political influence and money to have underqualified children admitted to the Vanguard program. Some parents believed that the River Oaks neighborhood program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1995 the school had about 500 students, with 40% White, 30% Black, 28% Hispanic, and 1% Asian. Large numbers of parents who were White, Black, and Hispanic protested against the proposal. Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD trustee and the author of &quot;Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston&quot;, stated that Vanguard parents were afraid of having to give up complete control over the school and share power with neighborhood parents.

During that year, the HISD school board voted on a proposal to open the school to neighborhood parents. The four White board members voted in favor, while the five non-White board members voted against it. Lana Shadwick, an assistant attorney of the Harris County government, campaigned for the HISD board to allow neighborhood enrollment at River Oaks. Two board members, Esther Campos and Robert Jefferson, said that an entity, through intermediaries at the request of Shadwick, offered $50,000 in board election campaign contributions if they would change their votes, and threatened to rally a group of parents to campaign for their opponents if they did not change their votes. Jose Salazar, the intermediary who contacted Campos, said that no such offer had ever been made. McAdams stated that the controversy caused public attention to focus on the HISD board and its racial makeup.

In an editorial, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; staff argued that &quot;Until there is another vote, HISD should continue its work to improve all of HISD&#x27;s neighborhood schools to lessen concerns that a child must qualify for some kind of magnet program and be bussed across town to be assured a quality education,&quot; and that the voting was done out of decentralization and not racial reasons, and so the perception that it was racial &quot;helps to give the issue a racial tinge it does not deserve, which only serves to aggravate an already tense situation.&quot;

Laurie Bricker, a white HISD board member, introduced a new plan that allowed parents of Vanguard students to include their non-Vanguard children in the neighborhood classes along with River Oaks neighborhood students. Bricker had the neighborhood program as a phase-in to appease Vanguard parents but some minority HISD trustees did not like that aspect of her program. On March 21, 1996, the board voted in favor of Bricker&#x27;s program 5–2, with 2 abstaining. Many neighborhood parents accepted the plan. Some Vanguard parents had objected. McAdams said that this vote ended the River Oaks controversy.

In the 1996–1997 school year, River Oaks Elementary introduced the neighborhood program, with for grades kindergarten through 2 admitted immediately. Grades 3 through 5 were grandfathered into the system. Prior to the rezoning, parts of the River Oaks neighborhood were zoned to Wilson Elementary School (now Baker Montessori School) in Neartown, while other parts were zoned to Will Rogers Elementary School (which closed after the 2005–2006 school year), and other parts were zoned to Poe Elementary School in Boulevard Oaks.

===Post-controversy===
In 2001 Lisa Gray of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; described River Oaks as having the &quot;most popular&quot; elementary-level Vanguard program in HISD.

River Oaks Elementary celebrated its 75th anniversary in the 2003–2004 school year. Jeff Bezos, a River Oaks alumnus, spoke at a luncheon during this event.

A new addition, which replaced temporary buildings, began construction during winter 2005 and was completed in summer 2007. The lead architect was Joiner Partnership, Incorporated, and the lead project manager was Heery International.

==Campus==
The campus is located at Kirby Drive and San Felipe Road, in proximity to the River Oaks Country Club. As of November 2008 the school building has of space, and its site is . The school, which has a color like that of sand, has a Colonial Revival/French colonial architectural style. The design, using natural slate, a Texas limestone exterior, and a light buff stucco, received inspiration from smaller French chateaux and buildings in New Orleans.

The original building was in an &quot;H&quot; shape, with the auditorium in the back. The original plan situated that would be dedicated to a play area with three playgrounds, with one for younger children of both sexes, one for older boys, and one for older girls, as well as a basketball court, a baseball diamond for students of both sexes, gymnastic equipment, jumping pits, a track, sand boxes, swings for smaller children, and a volleyball court. The playground for smaller children was to be located in the center of the play area tract, the playground for older boys was to be located on the south side of the play tract, and the playground for older girls was to be located on the north side of the play tract. The plan called for trees to be planted parallel to sidewalks along Avalon Road, Kirby Drive, and San Felipe Road. The auditorium was built square-shaped.

Its kindergarten area once housed a fireplace, which, along with its chimney, was given to the school by Ima Hogg. In 2005 the fireplace was moved to the teacher&#x27;s lounge during renovations, and it was later placed in the attic. As of 2010 there were efforts to restore the fireplace, with donations being the source of funding. Azalea flowers, used in the landscaping of various Houston landmarks, have been present in the landscaping of this school.

In November 2008 the alumni of River Oaks Elementary started a campaign to raise $3.4 million ($ when adjusted for inflation) to build a new library. They had already received a $1 million ($ when adjusted for inflation) gift. The plans for the library included a reading area with 16,500 books, a technology center with 32 computers, and a courtyard. Jennifer Radcliffe of the &quot;McClatchy - Tribune Business News&quot; said &quot;The addition would put the River Oaks library -- which already has one of the largest collections in HISD -- head and shoulders above other campuses.&quot; Barry Bishop, a director of library information at the Spring Branch Independent School District, said that the expansion of the River Oaks Elementary library &quot;kind of shakes the equity issue&quot; but because schools with poorer pupils have access to federal funds, foundation funds, and grants inaccessible to schools with wealthier student bodies, &quot;If you actually look at the money spent per student, at least from the library perspective, it kind of balances out.&quot; A neighborhood activist from Sunnyside, Alice Pradia, argued that HISD did not do enough to bolster libraries of school campuses.

River Oaks Elementary has a &quot;nature center&quot;, which opened in 1990, which has various plants as well as several insects and smaller animals in it.

==Demographics==
As of the 2011–2012 school year, River Oaks Elementary had 717 students. 50% were White, 20% were Asian or Pacific Islander, 16% were Hispanic, 7% were black, and less than 1% were Native American. 8% of students qualified for free and reduced lunch.

 about 56% of the elementary school-aged students living in the River Oaks Elementary attendance boundary attended River Oaks Elementary, according to HISD estimates.

Donald R. McAdams wrote that in 1995, at the time of the political turf battle involving River Oaks Elementary and neighborhood students, River Oaks was a &quot;middle class school.&quot; The student mix was 40% White, 30% Black, 28% Hispanic, and 1% Asian. 9% of students qualified for free and reduced lunch. According to HISD standards, all of the students were gifted and talented. McAdams wrote that most of the minority children classified as gifted and talented by HISD came from middle class households. In 1995, the largest group of River Oaks Elementary School parents resided in the City of West University Place and nearby neighborhoods.

McAdams wrote that in 1995 White parents liked the demographics because there was a &quot;high-cost, first class education in an almost perfect ethnic mix, and all this with ethnic harmony.&quot; McAdams wrote that the demographics made the school attractive to River Oaks parents who wanted to send their children there.

==Academics and gifted and talented designation==

Donald R. McAdams wrote that in 1995 River Oaks was &quot;not really full of gifted children&quot;. He cited the fact that, at the time, HISD put ethnic balances on the gifted and talented roster, with no more than 35% White and Asian and at least 65% Black and Hispanic overall, leading many White and Asian children to be excluded. In addition McAdams cited the mechanisms for gifted testing at the time. As of 1995, under Texas state law a gifted child was defined as one in the 95th percentile. Testing for gifted and talented status took place at Kindergarten. McAdams wrote that many children identified as gifted under this formula were simply well-educated by their parents and that this became apparent in the third grade. However a school would not dismiss a child already identified as gifted at that point. In 1997 HISD removed the ethnic guidelines to Vanguard enrollment after a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed in a federal court.

McAdams wrote that in 1995, compared to other Vanguard programs River Oaks test scores were on the &quot;low&quot; side. McAdams stated that eight neighborhood schools in trustee district 5, his district, had higher average test scores than River Oaks. Those schools had minority enrollments from 27% to 52%.

==Attendance boundary and feeder patterns==
All students who are zoned to River Oaks are also zoned to Lanier Middle School, and Lamar High School.

One condominium complex zoned to River Oaks Elementary is The Huntingdon.

<text>A literary magazine is a periodical devoted to literature in a broad sense. Literary magazines usually publish short stories, poetry, and essays, along with literary criticism, book reviews, biographical profiles of authors, interviews and letters. Literary magazines are often called literary journals, or little magazines, terms intended to contrast them with larger, commercial magazines.

== History ==
&quot;Nouvelles de la république des lettres&quot; is regarded as the first literary magazine; it was established by Pierre Bayle in France in 1684. Literary magazines became common in the early part of the 19th century, mirroring an overall rise in the number of books, magazines, and scholarly journals being published at that time. In Great Britain, critics Francis Jeffrey, Henry Brougham and Sydney Smith founded the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; in 1802. Other British reviews of this period included the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; (1824), &quot;The Spectator&quot; (1828), and &quot;Athenaeum&quot; (1828). In the United States, early journals included the &quot;Philadelphia Literary Magazine&quot; (1803–1808), the &quot;Monthly Anthology&quot; (1803–11), which became the &quot;North American Review&quot;, the &quot;Yale Review&quot; (founded in 1819), &quot;The Yankee&quot; (1828–1829) &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot; (1833–1865), &quot;Dial&quot; (1840–44) and the New Orleans–based &quot;De Bow&#x27;s Review&quot; (1846–80). Several prominent literary magazines were published in Charleston, South Carolina, including &quot;The Southern Review&quot; (1828–32) and &quot;Russell&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (1857–60). The most prominent Canadian literary magazine of the 19th century was the Montreal-based &quot;Literary Garland&quot;.

The &quot;North American Review&quot;, founded in 1815, is the oldest American literary magazine. However, it had its publication suspended during World War II, and the &quot;Yale Review&quot; (founded in 1819) did not; thus the Yale journal is the oldest literary magazine in continuous publication. Begun in 1889, &quot;Poet Lore&quot; is considered the oldest journal dedicated to poetry. By the end of the century, literary magazines had become an important feature of intellectual life in many parts of the world. One of the most notable 19th century literary magazines of the Arabic-speaking world was &quot;Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa&quot;.

Among the literary magazines that began in the early part of the 20th century is &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine. Founded in 1912, it published T. S. Eliot&#x27;s first poem, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;. Another was &quot;The Bellman&quot;, which began publishing in 1906 and ended in 1919, was edited by William Crowell Edgar and was based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Other important early-20th century literary magazines include &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (1902), &quot;Southwest Review&quot; (1915), &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; (1925), &quot;World Literature Today&quot; (founded in 1927 as &quot;Books Abroad&quot; before assuming its present name in 1977), &quot;Southern Review&quot; (1935), and &quot;New Letters&quot; (1935). The &quot;Sewanee Review&quot;, although founded in 1892, achieved prominence largely thanks to Allen Tate, who became editor in 1944.

Two of the most influential—though radically different—journals of the last half of the 20th century were &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; (&quot;KR&quot;) and the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, edited by John Crowe Ransom, espoused the so-called New Criticism. Its platform was avowedly unpolitical. Although Ransom came from the South and published authors from that region, &quot;KR&quot; also published many New York–based and international authors. &quot;The Partisan Review&quot; was first associated with the American Communist Party and the John Reed Club; however, it soon broke ranks with the party. Nevertheless, politics remained central to its character, while it also published significant literature and criticism.

The middle-20th century saw a boom in the number of literary magazines, which corresponded with the rise of the small press. Among the important journals which began in this period were &quot;Nimbus: A Magazine of Literature, the Arts, and New Ideas&quot;, which began publication in 1951 in England, the &quot;Paris Review,&quot; which was founded in 1953, &quot;The Massachusetts Review&quot; and &quot;Poetry Northwest&quot;, which were founded in 1959, &quot;X&quot; Magazine, which ran from 1959 to 1962, and the &quot;Denver Quarterly&quot;, which began in 1965. The 1970s saw another surge in the number of literary magazines, with a number of distinguished journals getting their start during this decade, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ploughshares,&quot; &quot;The Iowa Review,&quot; &quot;Granta&quot;, &quot;Agni&quot;, &quot;The Missouri Review,&quot; and &quot;New England Review&quot;. Other highly regarded print magazines of recent years include &quot;The Threepenny Review&quot;, &quot;The Georgia Review&quot;, &quot;Ascent&quot;, &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, &quot;The Greensboro Review&quot;, &quot;ZYZZYVA&quot;, &quot;Glimmer Train&quot;, &quot;Tin House&quot;, &quot;Half Mystic Journal&quot;, the Canadian magazine &quot;Brick&quot;, the Australian magazine &quot;HEAT&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Some short fiction writers, such as Steve Almond, Jacob M. Appel and Stephen Dixon have built national reputations in the United States primarily through publication in literary magazines.

The Committee of Small Magazine Editors and Publishers (COSMEP) was founded by Richard Morris in 1968. It was an attempt to organize the energy of the small presses. Len Fulton, editor and founder of Dustbook Publishing, assembled and published the first real list of these small magazines and their editors in the mid-1970s. This made it possible for poets to pick and choose the publications most amenable to their work and the vitality of these independent publishers was recognized by the larger community, including the National Endowment for the Arts, which created a committee to distribute support money for this burgeoning group of publishers called the Coordinating Council of Literary Magazines (CCLM). This organisation evolved into the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses (CLMP).

Many prestigious awards exist for works published in literary magazines including the Pushcart Prize and the O. Henry Awards. Literary magazines also provide many of the pieces in &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; and &quot;The Best American Essays&quot; annual volumes.

== Online literary magazines ==
&quot;SwiftCurrent&quot;, created in 1984, was the first online literary magazine. It functioned as more of a database of literary works than a literary publication. In 1995, the &quot;Mississippi Review&quot; was the first large literary magazine to launch a fully online issue. By 1998, &quot;Fence&quot; and &quot;Timothy McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot; were published and quickly gained an audience. Around 1996, literary magazines began to appear more regularly online. At first, some writers and readers dismissed online literary magazines as not equal in quality or prestige to their print counterparts, while others said that these were not properly magazines and were instead ezines. Since then, though, many writers and readers have accepted online literary magazines as another step in the evolution of independent literary journals. 

There are thousands of other online literary publications and it is difficult to judge the quality and overall impact of this relatively new publishing medium.

==Little magazines==
Little magazines, or &quot;small magazines&quot;, are literary magazines that often publish experimental literature and the non-conformist writings of relatively unknown writers. Typically they had small readership, were financially uncertain or non-commercial, were irregularly published and showcased artistic innovation.

<doc id="1112590" wikidata="Q1779055" url="?curid=1112590" title="Terry Francona">
<text>Terrence Jon Francona (born April 22, 1959), nicknamed &quot;Tito&quot;, is an American professional baseball manager and former player who is the current manager of the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously managed the Cleveland Indians/Guardians, Boston Red Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies. Francona played in MLB from 1981 to 1988 for the Montreal Expos, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, and Milwaukee Brewers.

After a four-year stint as the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, Francona was hired to manage the Red Sox in 2004 and led the team to their first championship since 1918. He won another World Series with Boston in 2007 and continued to manage the team until the end of the 2011 season. In 2013, Francona became the Cleveland Indians’ manager, leading them to an American League pennant in 2016, a 22-game win streak during the 2017 season (the longest in American League history and the second-longest in MLB history), and became the Indians/Guardians all-time leader in wins by a manager.

==Early life==
Francona was born on April 22, 1959, in Aberdeen, South Dakota, to Tito Francona (1933–2018), who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1956 to 1970, and Roberta Jackson (1932–1992). He is of Italian descent.

Francona grew up in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, about northwest of Pittsburgh. He attended New Brighton Area High School and played for the baseball team.

==Playing career==
Francona attended the University of Arizona, where he played college baseball for the Arizona Wildcats baseball team. Francona also represented the United States at the 1979 Pan American Games. The Arizona Wildcats won the 1980 College World Series and Francona was named the tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player. Francona won the 1980 Golden Spikes Award.

The Montreal Expos selected Francona in the first round of the 1980 MLB draft with the 22nd overall selection. After briefly playing in the minor leagues, Francona made his major league debut with Montreal on August 19, 1981, a week after the end of that summer&#x27;s player strike. He appeared mainly as an outfielder that first year, and he went 4-for-12 in the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, an extra playoff round used in that strike-divided season. The Expos won that series, three games to two.

Francona shifted to first base, where he ultimately played 100 games more than he had in the outfield. He also developed a reputation as a contact hitter, with few home runs, walks, or strikeouts and baseball writer Bill James described him as a &#x27;worthless player&#x27;.

The Expos released Francona after the 1985 season, during which his batting average had slipped to .267 after posting a .346 average in limited action in 1984. He went on to sign one-year contracts with the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, and Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers re-signed Francona for 1990, but he only played in three games for the Brewers that year, the last on April 19. In 10 seasons and 708 games, he posted a .274 career average, with 16 home runs and 143 runs batted in. He also made an appearance as a pitcher with Milwaukee on May 15, 1989, late in a game that the Brewers lost 12–2; he threw 12 pitches and struck out one batter (Stan Javier) on three pitches.

==Coaching career==
===As a coach===
After retiring as a player, Francona began coaching, spending several years in the Chicago White Sox organization. In 1991, he managed the Sarasota White Sox of the Gulf Coast League, a rookie league. In 1992, he managed the South Bend White Sox of the mid-level Class A Midwest League. As manager of the AA franchise Birmingham Barons in 1993–95, he posted a 223–203 record and earned several distinctions. In 1993, when Birmingham won the Southern League championship, Francona was named Southern League Manager of the Year and &quot;Baseball America&#x27;s&quot; Minor League Manager of the Year; in 1994, the year Michael Jordan played for Birmingham, &quot;Baseball America&quot; named him the top candidate to make the jump to the big leagues.

Francona managed in the Dominican Winter League with the Águilas Cibaeñas, and he also won the championship and the Serie del Caribe in 1995–96.

Francona became third-base coach for the Detroit Tigers in 1996, working under their new skipper, Buddy Bell, a former Reds teammate of Francona.

===As a manager===
====Philadelphia Phillies (1997–2000)====
After the 1996 season, he was hired as manager of the Phillies, who had won the NL pennant in 1993 but then had three consecutive losing seasons. In Francona&#x27;s four seasons (1997–2000) as the Phils&#x27; skipper, the club never rose above third place in the National League East. His best finish with the Phillies was 77–85 in 1999. In 1998 and 1999, the Phillies finished in third place, behind the Atlanta Braves and their division-rival New York Mets. He was fired after the 2000 season, finishing his Phillies tenure with a 285–363 record.

Francona spent the following season as a special assistant to the general manager with the Cleveland Indians in 2001, which was followed by two one-year terms as a bench coach for the Texas Rangers (2002) and Oakland Athletics (2003).

====Boston Red Sox (2004–2011)====

The Red Sox hired Francona to manage their club in 2004, after the team lost the 2003 American League Championship Series and manager Grady Little&#x27;s contract was not renewed.

Francona led the Red Sox to a 98–64 record in 2004, the second-best record in the American League behind their biggest rival, the New York Yankees. The club gelled in the second half and won more games than any other team in the American League after the All-Star break. As the American League wild card, the Red Sox swept the AL West champion Anaheim Angels, three games to none, in the Division Series. In the 2004 American League Championship Series, the Red Sox fell behind the Yankees, three games to none, including a 19–8 loss in Game 3 at home in Fenway Park. However, the club regained its composure and won the last four games of the series, the first time in Major League Baseball history that a team rallied from an 0–3 deficit to win a playoff series (only the third team to even make it as far as Game 6, and the first team to force a Game 7 after trailing a series three games to zero). The Red Sox then swept the St. Louis Cardinals 4–0 in the 2004 World Series to win the sixth world title in franchise history, and their first since 1918. The long-awaited victory ended 86 years of frustration for Red Sox fans.

Francona and the Red Sox posted a 95–67 record in 2005, tied with New York for first in the American League East. However, the Yankees were awarded the division due to their 10–9 record against Boston during the season. Once again the American League Wild Card winner, the Red Sox were swept in the ALDS by the Chicago White Sox, who went on to win the 2005 World Series.

The 2006 Red Sox started strong but stumbled in the second half of the season after many key players suffered extensive injuries. The team posted a 23–35 record over the final two months and finished at 86–76, third place in the AL East. It was the first time Boston had finished lower than second place since 1997.

Boston rebounded in 2007, winning the AL East for the first time since 1995, finishing two games ahead of the Yankees. Under Francona&#x27;s leadership, the Sox swept the Angels in the Division Series before dropping three of the first four games to the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS. The Sox, facing elimination, went on to win their next three games, defeating Cleveland to advance to the 2007 World Series, where they swept the Colorado Rockies in four games. Francona is the only manager in Major League history to win his first eight consecutive World Series games and just the second manager to guide two Red Sox clubs to World Series titles, the other being Bill &quot;Rough&quot; Carrigan, who led Boston to back-to-back championships in 1915 and 1916.

As of October 1, 2008, Francona&#x27;s career regular-season managerial record was 755–703 (.518), while his post-season record was 22–9 (.710). Among managers who have managed at least 20 post-season games, he has the highest winning percentage. Francona won his first seven playoff elimination games (not losing until being swept by the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 ALDS) and first nine ALCS elimination games (not losing until Game 7 of the 2008 ALCS at the Tampa Bay Rays).

On February 24, 2008, the Red Sox announced that they had extended Francona&#x27;s contract. Instead of expiring at the end of the 2008 season, it would expire after the 2011 season. The team also held club options for 2012 and 2013. Francona was guaranteed a total of $12 million over the first three years of the contract, plus a $750,000 buyout to be received if his 2012 and 2013 options were not exercised.

On June 2, 2009, Francona recorded his 500th win as manager of the Red Sox, making him the third manager in club history to have 500 wins. The only other two to win at least 500 games as manager of the Red Sox are Joe Cronin (1,071), and Pinky Higgins (560). On May 6, 2010, Francona became the fourth person to manage 1,000 games for the Red Sox.

On July 23, 2011, Francona got his 1,000th win as a manager, but his team collapsed historically in September, finishing 7–20 and squandering a nine-game lead over the Rays for the AL Wild Card spot. Following the season, the Red Sox declined to exercise Francona&#x27;s 2012 option. He finished his Red Sox career with a 744–552 record in the regular season—second to Cronin in victories, but tops in winning percentage (.574) among those having managed at least 750 games—and 28–17 (.622) in the postseason with those two World Series championships.

====Cleveland Indians / Guardians (2013–2023)====

Francona was hired as manager of the Cleveland Indians on October 6, 2012, and officially introduced on October 8. The Indians chose Francona over Sandy Alomar Jr., who had served as the club&#x27;s interim manager for the final six games of the 2012 season after Manny Acta was fired on September 27. Alomar, who had spent the past three seasons as a coach in Cleveland, and Francona were the only candidates interviewed for the Indians&#x27; opening. Alomar stayed in Cleveland on Francona&#x27;s staff as the bench coach. Under Francona, the Cleveland Indians finished the 2013 regular season with a record of 92–70, which was a 24-game improvement over the previous year. The Indians were eliminated from the 2013 MLB playoffs by losing 4–0 to the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Wild Card Game. On November 12, 2013, Terry Francona was named as the American League Manager of the Year. Francona agreed to a two-year extension on November 4, 2014. He led the team to a 177–147 record in his first two seasons as Indians manager.

Francona managed the Indians to the American League Central Division title in 2016. His team swept his former club, the Boston Red Sox, in three games in the divisional series—clinching a berth in the ALCS with a win at Fenway Park on October 10, 2016. On October 19, 2016, Francona&#x27;s Indians beat the Toronto Blue Jays to move on to the World Series, where the Indians won game 1 against the Chicago Cubs 6–0 to extend his World Series record to 9–0. He lost his first World Series game when the Indians were defeated by the Cubs in game 2 by a score of 5–1. The Indians won Game 3 against the Chicago Cubs 1–0. The Indians won Game 4 against the Chicago Cubs 7–2 to give Cleveland a 3–1 lead. The Indians would fall to the Cubs 3–2 in Game 5. Cleveland went on to lose Game 6 by a score of 9–3, then lose 8–7 in 10 innings in Game 7 handing Francona his first World Series loss. On November 15, 2016, Francona was named American League Manager of the Year for the second time in his career.

Cleveland turned in another successful season in 2017, with Francona undergoing a cardiac ablation. The highlight of the season was a 22-game win streak that spanned August 24 – September 15. Of historic proportions, the streak placed second longest all-time in major league history to the New York Giants&#x27; 26 consecutive (included ties and suspended games) in 1916. It surpassed the 2002 Oakland Athletics&#x27; 20 consecutive wins for the American League record. Dominant in all aspects, the Indians trailed at the end of just eight of the 199 innings, and their run-differential of plus-105 (142–37) was higher than all but six teams through that point in the entire 2017 season. The offense produced a .937 OPS, 54 points higher the next best team, the Twins. The Indians&#x27; 1.58 ERA scaled 1.15 points lower than the next-best club, the Arizona Diamondbacks. Their Central division lead over the second-place Twins swelled from games to games. In April 2019, the Indians extended Francona&#x27;s contract for two more years.

On July 29, 2021, Francona announced that he would step aside from the team for the rest of the year, citing health issues. He had dealt with a gastrointestinal issue in the 2020 season that led to managing just 14 games (Sandy Alomar Jr. served as acting manager and went 28–18); in February 2021, he had toe surgery for a staph infection, and a lingering hip problem also bothered him. Bench coach DeMarlo Hale took over as interim manager.

Francona entered the 2022 season as the longest-tenured manager in MLB with the same team. Also, since Francona had returned to the team, all the games he missed and that were managed by Hale in 2021 got credited to his record, thereby making him the all-time Indians/Guardians leader in wins by a manager (with 753 coming into 2022). In 2022, Francona led the Guardians to their first playoff appearance since 2020 and first AL Central title since 2018. Francona won the 2022 American League Manager of the Year, beating out Brandon Hyde and Scott Servais.
On October 3, 2023, Francona announced that he was stepping down as manager, again citing health issues.

==== Cincinnati Reds (2025-present) ====
Francona was hired as the manager of the Cincinnati Reds on October 4, 2024, agreeing to a three-year deal with the club.

====Managerial record====

===Broadcasting===
Following his departure from the Red Sox in 2011, Francona was employed by the Fox network as a substitute color analyst for the first two games of the American League Championship Series. Francona, who teamed with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck, filled in for regular Fox analyst Tim McCarver, who was recuperating from minor heart surgery.
On December 5, 2011, Francona signed with ESPN joining their &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; telecast, replacing Bobby Valentine, who himself replaced Francona as manager of the Red Sox. During the 2012 season, he worked as an analyst on &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot;, contributed to ESPN.com, and contributed to ESPN&#x27;s Little League World Series coverage.

==Personal life==
Francona married Jacque Lang on January 9, 1982, and they have four children: son Nicholas and daughters Alyssa, Leah, and Jamie. Nick played collegiate baseball for the University of Pennsylvania and for a time in the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. In 2003, Nick was drafted by the Boston Red Sox. Alyssa and Leah played on the University of North Carolina softball team. In 2009, Alyssa was a senior, and Leah was a freshman on the team. Jamie graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 2016.

It was revealed in October 2011 that Francona and Lang had recently separated and that Francona had been living in a hotel room during the baseball season. Francona later said that he and Lang were in the final stages of divorcing.

He is known for his ever-present wad of chewing tobacco. Francona and Indians&#x27; bench coach Brad Mills have been best friends since their college playing days and have coached together on the Phillies, Red Sox, Indians and Reds.

Francona&#x27;s mother, Roberta, died in 1992. His father, Tito, died in 2018.

===Health issues===

During the 2005 season, Francona was hospitalized after complaining of severe chest pains. Tests revealed significantly clogged arteries, but it was concluded that Francona had not suffered a heart attack. This incident, as well as a life-threatening pulmonary embolism suffered in 2002, painful knees, and ongoing treatment for blood clots, has led to circulation issues, which necessitate wearing extra clothes including two pairs of tights. This is also why his regular uniform top is usually hidden by a pullover.

During the months of June and July 2017, Francona missed several games because of feeling lightheaded. He was admitted to the Cleveland Clinic to undergo a series of tests. On July 7, 2017, it was announced that Francona underwent a catheter ablation to correct an irregular heartbeat. Because of the recovery period from the procedure, Francona had to skip the 2017 MLB All-Star Game, which he was due to coach. On July 8, 2017, he was released from the hospital and expected to rest until July 14, 2017, when the Indians started the second half of the season.

Francona missed most of the 2020 season and all of the postseason due to a blood clotting issue. On July 29, 2021, it was announced by the team that Francona would step away from managerial duties for the remainder of the 2021 season to focus on his health and recovery after managing the first 99 games of the regular season for a record of 50–49. DeMarlo Hale served as acting manager for the rest of the season.

<doc id="1112594" wikidata="Q328711" url="?curid=1112594" title="Aysun ibn Sulayman ibn Yaqdhan al-A'rabi">
<text>ʿAysūn ibn Sulaymān ibn Yaqdhān al-Kalbī al-Aʿrābī (), often known as Ayxun or Aisso, was the son of Sulayman al-Arabi, who was the wali of Barcelona and Girona in the late 8th century.

Aysun, together with his father Sulayman al-Arabi, joined Charlemagne&#x27;s army that besieged Zaragoza in 778. When Zaragoza failed to surrender, Charlemagne took hostages from his allies, including Sulayman.

Aysun and his brother Matruh al-Arabi were allied to the Basques, and at the battle of Roncesvalles they attacked the baggage train of the Frankish army in 778, releasing their father. Their father returned to Zaragoza and sent to Matruh to govern Barcelona (and Girona). However, in 780 Sulayman was killed by his former friend and Husayn of Zaragoza.

As a result, Aysun gave his loyalty to the Emir of Cordoba, Abd al-Rahman I, who was seeking to impose control over the northern Iberian states. He participated in the assault on Zaragoza in 781 (that compelled to Husayn submit) and in subsequent expeditions into Basque territories and Cerdaña, moving on then to Barcelona where his brother as Wali also submitted to the Emir.

Aysun had two servants: Amrus ibn Yusuf, a future general, and Sabrit, who after 785 served Matruh. Matruh rebelled and took Huesca and Zaragoza in about 789. However, Matruh was killed by Amrus (who became a supporter of the Emir) and Sarhabil ibn Saltan al-Zawagi in 791 or 792.

Al-Udri reports that Aysun was taken prisoner during the capture of Girona and sent to Aachen. According to Al-Udri, Aysun later escaped with the assistance of his servant Amrus.

Aysun shares his name with Aissó, leader of a revolt in 826. It has accordingly been suggested by historians including Al-Udri that as an elderly man Aysun escaped in the 826, to lead the revolt of the Goths and supporters of peace with the Muslims. However, there is no evidence to prove this, and it may simply have been a confusion of two different people with similar names.

<text>The Belize national football team represents Belize in international football and is controlled by the Football Federation of Belize, a member of the Central American Football Union of CONCACAF.

Although Belize has never qualified for a FIFA World Cup tournament, it has once qualified for a CONCACAF Gold Cup championship in 2013, in which they were eliminated in the group stage. Belize has also competed in the sub-regional Central American Cup championship in which their best result was fourth place in 2013. The nickname for the players of the national team is the &quot;Jaguars&quot;.

==History==

===Overview===
Named British Honduras whilst under British colonial rule, the country&#x27;s first international game came on February 19, 1928, beating Honduras 1–0. Following independence, Belize&#x27;s first game came on December 8, 1983, in a 2–0 loss against Canada in Belize. Although Belize gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1981 (and many of the UK&#x27;s current colonies have international teams), Belize did not begin to regularly play international football until 1995. It made its debut at the 1995 UNCAF Nations Cup and was eliminated in the first round after losing to El Salvador and Costa Rica.

Belize has never qualified for the World Cup but finished fourth in the 2013 Copa Centroamericana. Their fourth-place finish in the 2013 Copa Centroamericana gave Belize its first qualification to a major international competition, that being the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

suspended the FFB due to governmental interference.

==Team image==
In February 2023 the Football Federation of Belize unveiled a new logo that would represent Belize’s national teams. Created by Rolando Ramirez, the new logo prominently features a Jaguar, the nickname of the team. The FFB hoped that the new image would promote unity and pride in the Belize football community.

<text>The domain name pro is a generic top-level domain in the Domain Name System of the Internet. Its name is derived from &quot;professional&quot;, indicating its intended use by certified professionals.

==History==
In October 2000 Jason Drummond came up with the concept for a new top level domain name (TLD) and established RegistryPro to jointly bid with Register.com for .pro. In May 2002 RegistryPro signed its contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the organization that administers global domain names, under which it will operate the registry for the new top level domain (TLD) .pro. 

The domain was originally launched in June 2004 with registrations restricted to four professions: accountants, engineers, lawyers and medical professionals in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.

In March 2005, the registrar EnCirca introduced its controversial ProForwarding service which enabled unverified people and businesses to register domains. Registrants then had thirty days to provide verified credentials prior to their domain being activated. Total registrations reached 6,899 by January 2008.

Following consultation with ICANN, the domain was relaunched in September 2008 with a wider remit to include government certified professionals in all countries. Registrants are required to self-certify their professional status and agree to terms of use before registration, then subsequently provide detailed license information.

In 2012, RegistryPro was acquired by Afilias Limited.

==Registrations==
The official domain website describes the eligibility criteria as follows:
*Applicant provides professional services
*Applicant is admitted to or licensed by a government certification body or jurisdictional licensing entity recognized by a governmental body that regularly verifies the accuracy of its data.
*Applicant is in good standing.
The domain registry allows registration of third-level domains in the following domains:
*Legal: law.pro, avocat.pro, bar.pro, jur.pro, recht.pro
*Accountancy: cpa.pro, aaa.pro, aca.pro, acct.pro
*Medical: med.pro
*Engineering: eng.pro

As of April 2011, the domains may be registered through 44 accredited domain registrars. In January 2011, the number of registered domains surpassed 100,000.
As reported in April 2010, the majority of domains are registered in the United States (42%), followed by France (24%) and the Russian Federation (5%).

A regulatory change made the .pro domain name unrestricted to all registrants starting 16 November 2015.

<text>Mebrahtom &quot;Meb&quot; Keflezighi (; , &quot;Mebrāhtōm Kifl&#x27;izgī&quot;; born May 5, 1975) is a retired American long distance runner. He is the 2004 Olympic silver medalist in the marathon and finished in fourth place in the 2012 Summer Olympics. He won the 2009 New York City Marathon on November 1, 2009, and the 2014 Boston Marathon on April 21, 2014, becoming the first American man to win each race since 1982 and 1983, respectively. Keflezighi is a graduate of UCLA, where he won four NCAA championships competing for the UCLA Bruins track and field team. He came in fourth in the 2014 New York City Marathon on November 2, 2014, eighth in the 2015 Boston Marathon on April 20, 2015, and second in the 2016 U.S. Olympic Team Trials to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

==Early life and education==
Keflezighi and his family were refugees from modern-day Eritrea (then part of Ethiopia), who came to the United States via Italy in 1987. He is one of ten children.

Keflezighi began running while a student at Memorial Academy in San Diego, where he ran a 5:10 mile before going on to win both the 1600 meters and 3200 meters at the CIF California State Championships in 1994 for San Diego High School. Keflezighi became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1998 – the same year in which he graduated from UCLA. While at UCLA Keflezighi received numerous All-American awards and other accolades. He won four NCAA championships (the 5k and 10k outdoor and 5k indoor) during the 1996–97 season, including the cross-country title, spanning from the track and field season in the spring to the cross country season in the fall.

He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Career==
Keflezighi is a three-time national champion in cross country running, having won the USA Cross Country Championships in 2001, 2002 and 2009.

His fastest times for some standard distances are 3:42.29 for 1500 m, set in 1998; 13:11.77 for 5000 m, set in 2000; 27:13.98 for 10,000 m, set in 2001 (an American record which stood until 2010); and 2:08:37 for the marathon, set at the 2014 Boston Marathon.

On October 11, 2010, he released his autobiography, &quot;Run to Overcome&quot;, which was published by Tyndale House Publishers. The book, co-authored with noted sports writer Dick Patrick, included recollections about major milestones in his life, such as his Olympic competitions and other running highlights, as well as his early years, leading up to the present day. He is also the driving force behind the MEB Foundation, the &quot;MEB&quot; standing for &quot;Maintaining Excellent Balance,&quot; which principally promotes healthy living, and other positive lifestyle choices and motivation for school-age youth.

Despite his success, Keflezighi&#x27;s sponsor Nike did not renew his long-running contract in 2011. As a result, Keflezighi competed as an unsponsored athlete. In December 2011, Keflezhigi was signed up by sportswear company Skechers, whom he has represented since. In 2013, Keflezighi signed with elliptical cycling company ElliptiGO. Other current sponsors in 2014 include PowerBar, Sony, Oakley, Inc., Garmin, USANA Health Sciences, Generation UCAN, CEP Compression, New York Athletic Club, and KRAVE Jerky.

On April 21, 2014, Keflezighi became the first American man to win the Boston Marathon since 1983, besting many of the heavy African favorites in a new personal best of 2:08:37. With this victory, Keflezighi became the only Marathoner in history to win the Boston Marathon, the New York City Marathon, and an Olympic Medal.

At the end of 2014, Keflezighi was selected for the Jesse Owens Award as the USATF Athlete of the Year.

==Training==
Keflezighi uses nine-day training cycles instead of traditional training weeks, which he says allows him to concentrate on training while also allowing himself to recover. His training is composed of tempo runs, intervals, long runs and cross-training. In the weeks leading up to the 2014 Boston Marathon, he ran 2–3 times a day, and used his ElliptiGO for 10–20 mile cross-training rides to avoid injuries. Additionally, he tries to keep himself healthy with daily core-strengthening exercises, stretching, altitude training, tune-up races, and a high-protein diet with 5 servings of fruit.

==Products==
* In 2011, Sony released a special-edition Meb Keflezighi 2GB W Series Walkman MP3 Player. It came pre-loaded with audio tips, along with a booklet containing tips on running, nutrition, stretching and more. The product is now discontinued.
* On October 15, 2013, Skechers debuted the limited-edition GOmeb line of athletic shoes, which features the official shoe of Keflezighi, the GOrun Speed. The line commemorates his wins in both the 2009 New York City Marathon and 2014 Boston Marathon.
* On July 2, 2014, a limited-edition &#x27;Meb 8S&#x27; ElliptiGO was released to commemorate his 2014 Boston Marathon victory. The bike features his motto &quot;Run To Win&quot; and his signature, along with a patriotic-themed paint job.

==Personal life==
Keflezighi lives and trains in Tampa, where he moved in 2019 from his long-time home in San Diego. Keflezighi also previously trained in Mammoth Lakes, California, and is a member of the New York Athletic Club.

Keflezighi is represented by his brother Merhawi, who as a UCLA undergraduate was a student manager for the Bruin men&#x27;s basketball team (head student manager in 2001–02) and is a 2006 graduate of the UCLA School of Law. Keflezighi and his wife Yordanos married in November 2004 and have three daughters: Sara, Fiyori, and Yohana.

Keflezighi is a Catholic.

<doc id="1112611" wikidata="Q111973269" url="?curid=1112611" title="Little magazine">
<text>In the United States, a little magazine is a magazine genre consisting of &quot;artistic work which for reasons of commercial expediency is not acceptable to the money-minded periodicals or presses&quot;, according to a 1942 study by Frederick J. Hoffman, a professor of English. While George Plimpton disagreed with the diminutive connotations of &quot;little&quot;, the name &quot;little magazine&quot; is widely accepted for such magazines.
A little magazine is not necessarily a literary magazine, because while the majority of such magazines are literary in nature, containing poetry and fiction, a significant proportion of such magazines are not. Some have encompassed the full range of the arts, and others have grown from zine roots.

The traditional characteristics of a little magazine include a format, a two-color cover, and a semi-annual or quarterly publishing schedule. Literary magazines that do not qualify as little magazines for these reasons include &quot;Oxford American&quot; and the Lindhurst Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Doubletake&quot;, measuring , having complex four-color covers, and having bi-monthly publishing schedules.

&quot;Integral to the definition of the little magazine&quot;, according to scholars Ian Morris and Joanne Diaz, is penury. A later 1978 study by the (then) editors of &quot;TriQuarterly&quot; magazine described little magazines as putting &quot;experiment before ease, and art before comment&quot; and noting that &quot;[t]hey can afford to do so because they can barely afford to do anything; as a rule they do not, and cannot, expect to make money&quot;. Hoffman considered them to be avant-garde, and editor of the &quot;Kenyon Review&quot; Robie Macauley opined that such magazines &quot;ought to be ten years ahead of general acceptance&quot;. Ezra Pound observed that the more a magazine values profits, the less it is willing to experiment with things that are not (yet) acceptable to a mainstream readership.

It has been argued that little magazines that are associated with universities are not truly encompassed by the term, but the majority view amongst scholars is that they have similar enough purposes, formats, and contents to unaffiliated magazines in the genre that they can be considered little magazines also.
Historically, they were both devoted to social issues, literature, or critical inquiry, and edited by amateurs.

== Editors ==
Little magazine editors can be characterized as in the main idiosyncratic and dissatisfied with the status quo. The magazines themselves are in general, but with several notable exceptions, short-lived and do not out-last their founding editors. Editors have adopted ingenious, on occasion devious, means to finance their magazines, often financing them out of their own pockets.

== History ==
The earliest significant examples are the transcendentalist publication &quot;The Dial&quot; (1840–44), edited by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller, in Boston, and &quot;The Savoy&quot; (1896), edited by Arthur Symons, in London, which had as its agenda a revolt against Victorian materialism. Little magazines were significant for the poets who shaped the avant-garde movements like Modernism and Post-modernism across the world in the twentieth century.

Originally printed with traditional methods such as offset printing, the publication of little magazines saw a &quot;mimeo revolution&quot; in the 1960s with the advent of the mimeograph, which significantly reduced magazine printing costs. An example of this that also illustrates the devious approach to financing is Keith Abbot. He published &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; when he was a graduate student at Washington State University, stealing a box of mimeograph paper from the university and borrowing a mimeograph machine from a friend.

In the 1980s a similar revolution occurred as the photocopier superseded the mimeograph, further reducing costs as the availability of commercial photocopying services by companies such as Kinko&#x27;s obviated the need for editors (or their friends) to own a mimeograph machine. At the same time, university-sponsored magazines became more prevalent, whereas unaffiliated magazines had dominated the genre before the World Wars. 

Thousands of little magazines existed across North America by the close of the 20th century, most not fully supporting themselves and subsidized by state or federal grants and endowments from universities, colleges, and foundations, sometimes with unpaid staff.

The desire for low-budget publications brought an on-line revolution to little magazines at the turn of the 21st century. Firstly embracing blogs, they have diversified to Twitter, Facebook, and many other on-line publication channels. The on-line revolution also raised possibilities for content in the form of podcasts and audio-visual content not possible in a purely printed format.

In the U.S. South, postbellum little magazines had non-commercial ends, generally seeking to inform and influence their readers, rather than being marketed for profit, a skill that their amateur editors generally lacked. English professor Bes E. Stark Spangler traced four main phases of the postbellum pre-World War Two little magazine in the South. Immediately after the Civil War they mainly covered Southern topics and the works of Southern authors, changing at the turn of the 20th century into more critical views of Southern letters and life by new young scholars, becoming voices for the advent of modernism in the 1920s, and finally in the 1930s entering into the debate over the future economic prosperity of the South on the side of agrarianism, having heated debates with what they viewed as Southern &quot;liberals&quot;.

Examples of the first phase, which were a significant factor in keeping the genre of Southern letters alive for the two decades after the Civil War, include Daniel H. Hill&#x27;s 1866–1869 &quot;The Land We Love&quot;, which widened its readership by including agriculture and military history alongside the literature; W. S. Scott&#x27;s 1865–1869 &quot;Scott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;; Moses D. Hodge&#x27;s and William Hand Browne&#x27;s 1866 &quot;Eclectic&quot; (later to be the 1869 &quot;New Eclectic&quot; after its absorption of &quot;The Land We Love&quot; and finally changing to &quot;Southern Magazine&quot; in 1871); &quot;De Bow&#x27;s Review&quot;, an ante-bellum magazine revived briefly in 1866; Albert Taylor Bledsoe&#x27;s 1867–1869 &quot;Southern Review&quot;; Mrs Cicero Harris&#x27;s 1872–1882 &quot;The South Atlantic&quot;, which, like &quot;The Land We Love&quot;, augmented literature with science and art coverage; and the 1882–1887 &quot;Southern Bivouac&quot;, which was one of the last little magazines to be devoted to the Lost Cause.

The second phase, which was a reactionary movement amongst young scholars in Southern colleges and universities that was critical of the South, and which was discussed in the contemporary essays of John B. Hennemann, is exemplified by William P. Trent&#x27;s 1892 &quot;Sewanee Review&quot; (which Hennemann was later to edit), which would influence John Spencer Bassett to found the &quot;South Atlantic Quarterly&quot; in 1902. Both Trent and Bassett were professors, at the University of the South and at Trinity College, respectively, and Bassett in particular was risking his job by publishing, as his magazine directly addressed racial issues in the South and reform, something that his successor toned down, editor Edwin Mims. 

The early years of the third phase saw &quot;The Westminster Magazine&quot; founded in 1911 and affiliated with Oglethorpe University; Stark Young&#x27;s &quot;Texas Review&quot; affiliated with the University of Texas, which relocated to Southern Methodist University in 1924 and changed the name to &quot;Southwest Review&quot; under the editorship of Jay B. Hubbard; the 1921–1926 &quot;The Double Dealer&quot;; and John Crowe Ransom&#x27;s and Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s 1922 &quot;The Fugitive&quot; published by the Vanderbilt University Group. Other influences for the Southern Renascence were &quot;The Lyric&quot; and &quot;The Nomad&quot;, both of which had brief lifetimes in the 1920s.

As young writers from Vanderbilt, the &quot;Double Dealer&quot;, and others later took up postings in other universities, they would in turn found or edit other magazines, Crowe going on to edit &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, and Ransom together with Cleanth Brooks to found another (1935) &quot;Southern Review&quot;.

In the final phase, both established magazines like &quot;Sewanee Review&quot; and the new 1930s little magazines debated whether the South should remain agrarian or embrace industrialism. Also in the 1930s they were associated with New Criticism.

&quot;Sewanee Review&quot; is now the oldest Southern literary magazine, with other long-lived magazines dating from the 20th century, including &quot;Southwest Review&quot; (1915), &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; (1925), &quot;The Southern Review&quot; (1935–1942, then from 1965), &quot;Georgia Review&quot; (1947), &quot;Carolina Quarterly&quot; (1948), &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (1950), &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1956), &quot;Southern Poetry Review&quot; (1958), &quot;Massachusetts Review&quot; (1959), &quot;Crazyhorse&quot; (1960), &quot;Southern Quarterly&quot; (1962), &quot;Hollins Critic&quot; (1964), &quot;Greensboro Review&quot; (1966), &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1967), &quot;Southern Humanities Review&quot; (1968), &quot;New Orleans Review&quot; (1968), and &quot;The South Carolina Review&quot; (1968).

Many little magazines continued to be founded in the South in the last three decades of the 20th century, from &quot;Apalachee Quarterly&quot; in 1971 through &quot;The Chattahoochee Review&quot; in 1980 to &quot;Five Points&quot; in 1997, still devoted to the core little magazine subject of literature, including short fiction, poetry, book reviews, and creative non-fiction. As &quot;The Land We Love&quot; did in the 19th century, 20th-century little magazines still received vastly more unsolicited literary contributions than they published, the &quot;Atlanta Review&quot; for example reporting in 1997 that it received 12,000 submissions for every 100 pieces published.

<doc id="1112615" wikidata="Q1228453" url="?curid=1112615" title="Disco Inferno (band)">
<text>Disco Inferno were an English experimental rock band active in the late 1980s and the 1990s. Initially a trio of guitar, bass, and drums performing in an identifiable post-punk style, the band soon pioneered a dynamic use of digital sampling in addition to standard rock instruments. While commercially unsuccessful during their existence, the band is considered to be a key post-rock act.

==History==
Disco Inferno formed in 1989 in Essex by teenagers Ian Crause (guitars and vocals), Paul Willmott (bass), Daniel Gish (keyboards) and Rob Whatley (drums), although Gish soon quit the band to join Bark Psychosis, leaving Disco Inferno as a trio. They were initially a post-punk band heavily influenced by bands such as Joy Division and Wire, releasing their first album &quot;Open Doors, Closed Windows&quot; in July 1991, alongside the &quot;Entertainment&quot; single, also from 1991, and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Science&quot; EP, all of which were compiled onto the compilation album &quot;In Debt&quot; (1992).

However, Crause soon became infatuated with the unique sounds of bands My Bloody Valentine and the Young Gods, as well as the Bomb Squad&#x27;s hip hop production and sampling on the music of Public Enemy, and with the release of the &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Sound&quot; EP, released later on in 1992 by, the band&#x27;s musical style changed towards sample-based electronic sounds. The band &quot;hit upon a seemingly simple but ultimately world-opening idea&quot; with the EP: to write their instruments through samplers, and unlike their contemporaries who sampled elements of music, film dialogue or other media, Disco Inferno &quot;engaged with the whole world&quot;, using their set up to record sounds ranging from running water, the wind, whistling birds, boots, car crashes and angry voices. Crause had purchased a Roland S-750 sampler with his savings and started programming towards the band&#x27;s sound for six months. In a 2011 interview, Wilmott recalled of the era:

&quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Sound&quot; was praised for its uncompromising, innovative and experimental sound, and the group expanded the approach with their subsequent EPs &quot;A Rock to Cling To&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Last Dance&quot; (1993), both of which were released on Rough Trade Records after their previous label Cheree closed. According to Andy Kellman of AllMusic, the new label &quot;saved the band&#x27;s life, as the members believed that they were too challenging for anyone else to understand or care for.&quot; Kellman commented that, &quot;disorienting, confusing, and highly schizophrenic, the challenging releases were in direct contrast to the prevailing Britpop scene of the time,&quot; taking &quot;A.R. Kane&#x27;s futurist pop a couple steps further and secured a devout and small following that found solace in their wildly imaginative, peerless nature.&quot; The band became characterized as one of the first post-rock bands. Crause and Whatley purchased MIDI-controlled instruments to order the replicate the samples live, with Willmott&#x27;s bass serving as an anchor to the unpredictable sounds being made. AllMusic described their sample-based work as a pioneering example of indie electronic music.

In a 2011 interview, Crause explained &quot;Most of these other what are now called post-rock groups, I think they regarded us as a kind of tinker-toy group because of the pop songs and the sampling so there was little chance of them deciding to follow us in the sampling - no critical consensus had been built for them to aspire to it - we kind of got ours from Public Enemy, who were too black and the Young Gods, who sang in French, for fuck&#x27;s sake! And it wasn&#x27;t seen as &#x27;serious&#x27; enough, perhaps meaning it wasn&#x27;t seen as commercially viable enough... who knows. Anyway, I did it &#x27;cos I had the ideas.&quot;

The band&#x27;s musical approach reached its peak on their second album &quot;D. I. Go Pop&quot;, released in February 1994. The album&#x27;s music was harsh and concise, with the melody on the eight tracks often carried by the bassline, while an array of samples (including running water, breaking glass, car crashes and fax machines) built the musical collages. After &quot;D. I. Go Pop&quot; the band opted for restraint on the &quot;Second Language&quot; EP, which also featured a new-found optimism in Crause&#x27;s lyrics. The band&#x27;s next single, &quot;It&#x27;s a Kid&#x27;s World&quot;, sampled the drumbeat from Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Life&quot; and added in a series of old children&#x27;s TV themes.

Despite critical acclaim, Disco Inferno attracted little commercial success. Combined artistic and financial pressure began to erode their sense of common purpose and loyalty. The band split acrimoniously in 1995, prior to the release of their final album, &quot;Technicolour&quot;, which was released in July 1996.

In September 1999, the Tugboat label released &quot;The Mixing It Session&quot;, which featured six instrumental tracks the band had recorded for radio, while One Little Indian Records reissued &quot;D. I. Go Pop&quot; and gave &quot;Technicolour&quot; a belated US release in 2004. In September 2011, One Little Indian released a compilation entitled &quot;The 5 EPs&quot;, featuring tracks from all five of the now out-of-print EPs released between 1992 and 1994.

==Subsequent projects==

===Ian Crause===

After the split, Ian Crause formed Floorshow who recorded some material for an unreleased album which was to be called &quot;The Vertical Axis&quot;. Some of these songs later appeared on his solo singles in the early 2000s (&quot;Elemental&quot; and &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;), which featured drummer Ritchie Thomas (Dif Juz, The Jesus and Mary Chain). Crause would then spend the best part of a decade away from music and eventually left the UK to move to Bolivia.

Crause returned to music in mid-2012 with a track called &quot;More Earthly Concerns&quot;, which resurrected Disco Inferno&#x27;s sample-heavy textured approach and was released via various blogs. This was followed in November 2012 by &quot;The Song of Phaethon&quot;, a long-form single release on Bandcamp inspired by both Greek mythology and British involvement in the Second Gulf War. Several other tracks (&quot;The Vertical Axis&quot;, &quot;Suns May Rise&quot;, &quot;Black Light&quot;, and &quot;A World of Ghosts&quot;) were released on Bandcamp in early 2013. Crause&#x27;s long-delayed debut solo album, &quot;The Vertical Axis&quot; (also a Bandcamp release) followed in December 2013.

===Paul Wilmott===

Paul Wilmott formed Transformer, who recorded a cover of Wire&#x27;s &quot;Outdoor Miner&quot;, which appeared on the Wire tribute album, &quot;Whore&quot; (1996). He would later play in the short-lived London Records-signed trip hop band Lisp.

<text>Chloric acid, HClO3, is an oxoacid of chlorine, and the formal precursor of chlorate salts. It is a strong acid (p&quot;K&quot;a ≈ −2.7) and an oxidizing agent.

==Properties==

Chloric acid is thermodynamically unstable with respect to disproportionation.

Chloric acid is stable in cold aqueous solution up to a concentration of approximately 30%, and solution of up to 40% can be prepared by careful evaporation under reduced pressure. Above these concentrations, chloric acid solutions decompose to give a variety of products, for example:
:

==Hazards==
Chloric acid is a powerful oxidizing agent. Most organics and flammables will deflagrate on contact.

==Production==
It may be produced from barium chlorate through its reaction with sulfuric acid, which results in a solution of chloric acid and insoluble barium sulfate precipitate:

The chlorate must be dissolved in boiling water and the acid should be somewhat diluted in water and heated before mixing. 

Another method which can be used to produce solutions up to 10% concentration is by the use of cation exchange resins and a soluble salt such as , where the Na+ cation will exchange with H+. 

Another method is the heating of hypochlorous acid, producing chloric acid and hydrogen chloride:

Any way it is produced, the acid may be concentrated up to 40% in a vacuum dessicator over .

<text>Chicago VIII is the seventh studio album by American rock band Chicago, released on March 24, 1975 by Columbia Records. Following the experimental jazz/pop stylings of &quot;Chicago VII&quot;, the band returned to a more streamlined rock-based sound on this follow-up.

==Background==
After five consecutive years of constant activity, the members of Chicago were feeling drained as they came to record &quot;Chicago VIII&quot; at producer James William Guercio&#x27;s Caribou Ranch in Colorado in the summer of 1974. While the variety in styles explored on &quot;Chicago VIII&quot; were reminiscent of &quot;Chicago VI&quot;, this particular album had a more distinct rock feel, as exemplified on Peter Cetera&#x27;s &quot;Anyway You Want&quot; (later covered by Canadian singer Charity Brown) and &quot;Hideaway&quot;, as well as Terry Kath&#x27;s Hendrix tribute &quot;Oh, Thank You Great Spirit&quot; and James Pankow&#x27;s hit &quot;Old Days&quot; (#5). The ballad &quot;Brand New Love Affair, Part I &amp; II&quot; charted at #61.

Preceded by Lamm&#x27;s &quot;Harry Truman&quot; (#13) as lead single, &quot;Chicago VIII&quot; was held over for release until March 1975 as &quot;Chicago VII&quot; was still riding high in the charts. While it easily reached #1 in the US, the album had a lukewarm critical reception — still commonly considered, by some, as one of their weakest albums from the original lineup, resulting in the briefest chart stay of any Chicago album thus far. It was also the first album to feature session percussionist Laudir de Oliveira as a full-fledged band member rather than merely a sideman, the first addition to the original lineup.

Inside the original LP package was an iron-on t-shirt decal of the album cover and a poster of the band in a station wagon being pulled over by a policeman.

On the RPM Canada charts, confusion endured when the LP was mis-identified during its chart run as &quot;Chicago VII&quot;; the catalog number listed proved it was really &quot;VIII&quot;.

This album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. In 2002, &quot;Chicago VIII&quot; was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records with two unreleased songs: &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; (an instrumental, or possibly a backing track) by Kath and &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; by Lamm, as well as a version of &quot;Satin Doll&quot; recorded for a Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; special - all as bonus tracks.

<text>Jonathan Michael Brown (born 27 February 1971) is a former British long-distance runner who specialised in 10,000 metres, cross country running and the marathon.

==Athletics career==
Born in Bridgend, Wales, he was affiliated with the City of Sheffield Athletic Club in England during his career. He gained Canadian citizenship in 2005, after living in there since 1996; but continued to make himself available for Britain until switching sporting allegiance at the start of 2008.

Earlier in his running career he competed for the Iowa State Cyclones Track and Field and Iowa State Cyclones Cross Country teams. He was a bronze medallist in the 5000 m at the 1992 European Athletics U23 Cup.

He won the 1996 European Cross Country Championships and is a three-time Olympian; who placed fourth in two successive Olympic Games whilst representing Great Britain. He twice represented Britain at the World Championships in Athletics, running the 5000 metres in 1993 and 10,000 metres in 1999. He was also a five-time participant at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, his best finish being eighth place in 1999. At the 1994 Goodwill Games he took the 5000 m bronze medal. He was also a close fourth at the 1998 European Athletics Championships 10,000 m, two and a half seconds behind Germany&#x27;s Stéphane Franke.

Brown participated in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic 10,000 metres where he placed tenth (27:59.74). This was followed by the marathon at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where he placed fourth, and also in the 2004 Athens Olympics, where he was again fourth in the marathon. In the former race he missed third place by seven seconds and in the latter by fifteen seconds.

His personal best times for the 10K run (27:20 minutes) and the 15K run (42:39 minutes) were the fastest by any European runner, but they have not been ratified as European records. His 10K time is still the fastest, while his 15K time has since been beaten by Julien Wanders, who also holds the official European 10K record.

He has won several road races on the circuit including the 1996 Gasparilla Distance Classic and the 1999 San Silvestre Vallecana. He was also successful at cross country meetings in Spain, winning at the 1996 Cross Internacional Valle de Llodio, 1997 Cross Internacional Juan Muguerza and the 1999 Cross de San Sebastián.

==International competitions==
==Personal bests==
*1500 metres (track) – 3:40.53 min (1992)

<text>The  (, ) is a supplication () attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib (), the fourth Rashidun caliph (), the first Shia Imam, and the cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It has been transmitted on the authority of Kumayl ibn Ziyad (), a close associate of Ali. This contains esoteric teachings about divine mercy and repentance, and remains popular especially among Shia Muslims.

== About ==
Kumayl ibn Ziyad was a prominent nobleman in Kufa, Iraq. He was outspoken against the Rashidun caliph Uthman () and was consequently exiled to Hims in Syria. Soon after the assassination of Uthman in 656 CE, he joined the new caliph Ali in Medina as one of his close associates. Later he was appointed by Ali as the governor of Hit, north of Kufa, where he prevented an early incursion by Mu&#x27;awiya, the rebellious governor of Syria. Kumayl also fought alongside Ali in the Battle of Siffin in 657 against Mu&#x27;awiya. Some years after the assassination of Ali in 661, Kumayl participated in the abortive revolt of Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath in 700 against the Umayyad viceroy al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf and was executed by him circa 708 for his role in the rebellion and for his continued devotion to Ali.

The is quoted on the authority of Kumayl, who is said to have learned this from Ali. In turn, Ali may have attributed the to Khidr, a figure, likely a prophet, who is described but not named in the Quran. Indeed, Ali often referred to Khidr as &#x27;his brother&#x27;, claiming Khidr appeared to him assuming the form of different people. Among Shia scholars, the is quoted by al-Tusi () in his , by Ibn Tawus () in his , and by Sharif al-Murtada (). The is also featured in , a widely circulated collection of s compiled by the Shia scholar Abbas Qomi (). There are several commentaries concerning this , some of which are listed by the Shia jurist Agha Bozorg Tehrani () in his . The was translated to English by the philosopher and academic William Chittick. Especially among Shia Muslims, the remains popular, recited every Thursday night, and on mid-Shaban. The invocation of this is said to be &quot;useful for protecting against the evil of enemies, for opening the gates of one&#x27;s daily bread and for the forgiveness of sins.&quot;

== Content ==
=== Divine mercy ===
Perpetual and constant remembrance of God is highlighted in this , a passage of which reads, &quot;[O God!] Make all my time, in the night and the day, inhabited by Your remembrance.&quot; The benefits of this remembrance are explained in another passage of the , &quot;O He whose name is a remedy and whose invocation () is the cure.&quot;

The is also rich with esoteric teachings, chief among them the concept of , which might be translated from Arabic as &#x27;loving mercy and compassion&#x27;. The begins, &quot;O God! I ask You by your mercy () &#x27;which embraces all things&#x27;,&quot; which alludes to verse 7:156 of the Quran, or verses 6:12 and 6:54 of the Quran, according to which, God has &#x27;inscribed&#x27; on His self the principle of mercy. A few verses later, the continues, &quot;by Your names, which have filled the foundations of all things.&quot; Together, these two verses of the supplication imply that the defining quality of all divine names is mercy, suggests the Islamic author Reza Shah-Kazemi. As this mercy fills the foundations of all things, he continues, anything that lacks mercy is only temporary and transient. For Shah-Kazemi then, a central message of the is that there is hidden mercy even in the outwardly most absurd happenings, a mercy which would be revealed to most people only when the &quot;veil&quot; is lifted at death. Another verse of the supplication reads, &quot;My far-fetched hopes have held me back from my true gain,&quot; echoing other statements attributed to Ali, including, &quot;Most shattered minds have been felled by lightning bolts of covetous desires.&quot;

=== Repentance ===
Having invoked the mercy of God, the then appeals to this mercy, &quot;O God! I find no forgiver of my sins, no concealer of my ugly acts, no transformer () of my ugly acts into beautiful ones, but You.&quot; The last part is an allusion to verse 25:70 of the Quran, &quot;God will transform their ugly acts into beautiful ones,&quot; a divine promise to those who repent and act virtuously afterward. The continues, 

This refusal to despair from the mercy of God is also evident in another saying attributed to Ali, &quot;The one who truly understands () among all those who understand is the one who never makes people despair of the mercy of God.&quot; A few other passages from the follow below after minor edits.

<doc id="1112635" wikidata="Q7368445" url="?curid=1112635" title="Rosemary Vodrey">
<text>Rosemary Lynn Vodrey (born October 20, 1949) is a former Canadian politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 1999 and was a senior cabinet minister of the government of Gary Filmon.

==Early life and career==

Vodrey was born Rosemary Webster on October 20, 1949, the daughter of senior Toronto police officer Jack Webster. She studied Psychology at the University of Toronto before moving to Winnipeg with her partner. Vodrey later became a school psychologist and lectured in home economics at the University of Manitoba.

She became politically active after befriending Gary and Janice Filmon and sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1988 provincial election in the central Winnipeg division of Osborne. She finished third, behind Liberal candidate Reg Alcock and incumbent New Democrat Muriel Smith.

==Member of the Legislative Assembly==

Vodrey ran for the legislature a second time in the 1990 provincial election and defeated incumbent Liberal Laurie Evans in the Fort Garry division in south-central Winnipeg. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government, and Vodrey entered the legislature as a government backbencher. She faced a credible challenge from Liberal Jim Woodman in the 1995 provincial election but was re-elected as the Filmon government won a second majority across the province.

==Cabinet minister==

===Minister of Education and Training===

Vodrey was appointed to Filmon&#x27;s cabinet on January 14, 1992, replacing Len Derkach as Minister of Education and Training. Some criticized Filmon&#x27;s choice, arguing that Vodrey&#x27;s decision to send her children to private school made her an inappropriate choice to oversee the public system.

;Court decisions

There were two important court decisions relating to education during Vodrey&#x27;s tenure as Education Minister. In August 1992, a provincial judge determined that a section of the Manitoba Public Schools Act requiring mandatory Christian prayer in the classroom was unconstitutional. Manitoba was the last Canadian province to require prayer in public schools, and Vodrey did not challenge the decision.

In March 1993, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a unanimous decision requiring Manitoba to give exclusive control over French-language education to the province&#x27;s francophone community. Vodrey welcomed this decision, saying that her government was already proceeding with legislation and promising that a new francophone school division would be in place by September. Manitoba&#x27;s francophones generally supported the framework plan that was introduced two months later.

;Budget cuts

The Filmon government introduced austerity measures on education in 1993, including a $16 million cut to public education funding and a 2% cap on school tax increases. Many parents opposed the cuts, while trustees criticized the cap as an encroachment on the autonomy of their boards. Vodrey later rejected a request from the Manitoba Association of School Trustees (MAST) to introduce wage freezes that would absorb some of the resulting financial burden, though she did agree to a separate proposal that allowed boards not to pay their staff for as many as eight professional development days. Manitoba&#x27;s universities were also affected by the austerity drive, with officials at the University of Manitoba predicting layoffs and restricted access to some courses. Vodrey&#x27;s decision to cap tuition increases at 5% was nevertheless described as relatively favourable to student interests.

Vodrey also announced cuts to rural and northern clinician services, as well as the elimination of Manitoba&#x27;s post-secondary bursary program, a 35% cut to her department&#x27;s New Careers program, and a 75% surcharge on tuition fees for international students. She argued that the cuts were necessary as part of her government&#x27;s response to a debt crisis. Some in the media speculated that Finance Minister Clayton Manness, rather than Vodrey, was the primary instigator of this policy.

;Other initiatives

Vodrey unveiled a task force report on Manitoba education in April 1993, highlighted by recommendations that the province assume all costs for special-needs children and that parents be given a greater role in education. John Plohman, education critic for the opposition New Democratic Party, welcomed the report but expressed concern that many of its recommendations would never be implemented by the Filmon government.

In July 1993, Vodrey established a provincial commission to review Manitoba&#x27;s school division boundaries. The five-person commission was headed by former Winnipeg Mayor Bill Norrie and was given 16 months to conduct its research. Some critics expressed concern that the commission&#x27;s work would lead to fewer and larger divisions.

Vodrey favoured greater cooperation with the federal government to establish national goals and standards for education.

;Assessments

In a June 1993 editorial, &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; columnist Jim Carr described Vodrey as &quot;perhaps the biggest disappointment&quot; in the Filmon cabinet. He characterized her treatment of school boards as &quot;cavalier&quot;, and wrote that she had demonstrated little interest in improving the public school system. He later described her as &quot;little more than a messenger of bad news&quot; to school divisions and universities, while also writing that her skills might be better suited to a &quot;less sensitive portfolio&quot;.

In 1995, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; reported that the Filmon government had quietly shifted funds away from public and post-secondary education and into private training programs and private schools between 1988 and 1993.

===Minister of Justice===

Vodrey was promoted to Minister of Justice and Attorney General on September 10, 1993, with additional ministerial responsibility for Constitutional Affairs and the Status of Women. She was retained in these positions after the 1995 provincial election.

;Criminal justice

Vodrey&#x27;s first major decision as Justice Minister was to call an emergency summit of police, educators and community groups, following the fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old boy in Winnipeg. The summit took place in December and featured diverse opinions on the effectiveness of Canada&#x27;s Young Offenders Act. Two months after the summit, Vodrey brought forward a crime reform package that included wilderness boot camps for young offenders, increased police surveillance of gangs, violence prevention workshops, a school violence coordinator, and a youth gang and violence phone line that would both receive confidential information and provide counselling services.

Vodrey&#x27;s proposal for boot camps was controversial. New Democratic Party Justice critic Gord Mackintosh described it as &quot;a simplistic, sensational way of pandering to vengeance&quot;, while some social workers argued the camps would actually reinforce criminal behaviour. Aboriginal leaders also expressed concern that these camps could have the same negative effect on native children as did the residential school system and criticized Vodrey for not seeking input from indigenous groups. Others argued that Vodrey&#x27;s proposal had merit, and deserved to be given a trial run. In response to criticism, Vodrey promised that the camps would be humane and non-abusive, unlike the harsh, military-style youth camps that had been introduced previously in the United States. Vodrey formally opened two camps in September 1994, though opposition critics suggested that her department had simply made minor adjustments to existing youth correction services.

Vodrey also introduced legislation to make parents financially liable for the property offences of their children. Critics questioned the effectiveness of this measure, noting that many of the affected families would already be low-income. The measure was passed by Vodrey&#x27;s successor, Vic Toews, in 1997.

Vodrey&#x27;s plan to take driver&#x27;s licenses from young offenders was less controversial and won the support of the NDP opposition. She later brought forward legislation compelling parents who refuse to pay child support to lose their licenses, joint holdings, and pension credits. The legislation was passed in 1995. Later in the year, Manitoba&#x27;s acting ombudsman reported that most of its reforms had not yet been implemented, and that no significant change had taken place in the child support system. In early 1996, Vodrey introduced significant fine increases for offences such as speeding and underage drinking.

In February 1995, Vodrey introduced a policy that allowed law enforcement agencies to publicize the names of high-risk sex offenders being released from prisons into Manitoba communities. This was believed to be the first such policy in Canada, and some expressed concern that it could provoke vigilantism. Vodrey also announced changes to the province&#x27;s prisons in early 1995, including a ban on television during the day, fewer telephone calls, reduced visit time, and a stricter work regimen.

In December 1995, Vodrey launched a provincial task force to make civil courts more responsible, accessible and efficient. Critics noted that the Manitoba Bar Association had already set up a similar task force, which included a member appointed by Vodrey&#x27;s department.

;Relations with the federal government

As provincial Justice Minister, Vodrey often encouraged the federal government to toughen provisions of the Young Offenders Act. In 1994, she proposed that the government publicize the names of young offenders when doing so would increase public safety, lower the age of criminal responsibility below 12 for repeat and &quot;heinous&quot; offenders, and make parents financially liable for the property offences of their children. The government of Alberta supported Vodrey&#x27;s approach, while Ontario and Quebec favoured more cautious reforms. In early 1995, federal Justice Minister Allan Rock announced that he would accept Vodrey&#x27;s proposal to name offenders, but would not lower the age of criminal responsibility or make parents liable.

Vodrey suggested several changes to Canada&#x27;s anti-stalking laws in early 1995, including a reverse-onus bail clause for alleged stalkers, a provision that stalkers who kill their victims be deemed automatically guilty of first-degree murder, and a requirement that persons convicted of stalking submit their weapons and licenses to authorities. Rock&#x27;s reform package, announced in late 1995, included Vodrey&#x27;s recommendation for mandatory first-degree murder charges. Vodrey later supported Rock&#x27;s effort to increase penalties for violent and sexual offenders.

Vodrey opposed the creation of the Canadian gun registry and refused to administer the program in Manitoba.

;Judiciary

In December 1993, opposition parties and aboriginal groups called for an independent inquiry into complaints about controversial provincial judge Bruce McDonald. McDonald had been suspended from the bench in May 1993 after the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; ran a series of investigative articles into his handling of family law cases, drawing particular attention to prejudiced statements he had made about women and indigenous Canadians. He later resigned from the bench just as a judicial review into his conduct was scheduled to begin. Vodrey argued that McDonald&#x27;s resignation obviated the need for a public review, and said that further concerns could be raised during a planned overhaul of the judicial council the following year. In December 1994, Vodrey announced that future judicial reviews could be permitted to continue even if the judges in question decide to resign.

The Filmon government imposed ten unpaid Fridays per year on provincial judges as a cost-cutting measure in the early 1990s. Several judges criticized this decision, arguing that it created an unacceptable backlog in the system. In July 1994, the Manitoba Provincial Judges Association filed legal papers alleging that the government had threatened to withhold a pay raise if the judges proceeded with a planned lawsuit over the matter. Vodrey declined to comment, but opposition parties accused the government of treating judges like civil servants.

Vodrey appointed Judith Webster as Chief Justice of the Provincial Court of Manitoba in December 1993. Webster was the first woman to hold this position.

;Other

In February 1994, the federal and provincial governments joined with indigenous groups to establish a new funding formula for police services in aboriginal communities. In supporting the pact, Vodrey said that it would allow aboriginal input into the allocation of funds. Critics noted that it did not provide for the immediate restoration of native-run police agencies, most notably the Dakota Ojibway Tribal Council (DOTC) force that had been dismantled the previous year. Later in the year, Vodrey signed an interim agreement to provide for the DOTC force&#x27;s return.

Vodrey announced a provincial gun amnesty program in May 1994, in which Manitobans were encouraged to turn in illegal firearms without fear of arrest. The project yielded 500 weapons, including explosives and three machine guns. Later in the same year, Vodrey granted the Brandon police force permission to carry semi-automatic handguns.

On October 23, 1995, Vodrey gave Winnipeg Mayor Susan Thompson $2 million to hire forty new police officers for the city. Some skeptics noted that this event took place two days before the 1995 municipal election, in which Thompson was facing a difficult challenge from two rival candidates. Vodrey denied there was any attempt to influence the outcome of the vote.

Vodrey commissioned a civil justice review task force in early 1996, to review the province&#x27;s handling of divorce and child-custody cases and to prevent damage being done to spouses, children and families.

;Headingley Jail Riot

A serious riot broke out at Manitoba&#x27;s Headingley Correctional Institution on April 25, 1996. Eight guards and about forty prisoners were injured, some seriously, as a group of inmates ransacked parts of the jail for the better part of a day. By the end of the riot, the prison had no heat or electricity and the actual building was largely destroyed. Several guards later complained that staff cutbacks and unsafe working conditions were ongoing concerns in the period leading up to the violence.

Vodrey announced an independent review into the riot but rejected requests for a full-scale public inquiry. Prison guards across the province subsequently went on a three-day strike, seeking both an inquiry and the resignation of several officials responsible for overseeing the prison, including Vodrey. The opposition New Democratic Party also criticized Vodrey&#x27;s response to the crisis, arguing that she was not forthcoming about the number of prisoners released from other prisons to alleviate overcrowding when inmates were transferred from Headingley. These criticisms were reduced somewhat after Vodrey appointed respected former judge Ted Hughes to conduct the inquiry.

Hughes submitted a report in December 1996 that described Headingley as having been a social powder keg before the riot, with serious problems in both safety and labour relations. He also described Vodrey as &quot;surprisingly&quot; ignorant of these problems in her capacity as minister. Vodrey accepted responsibility and expressed regret that she did not know of the prevailing circumstances at the prison.

;Assessments

Vodrey became known for making high-profile policy announcements during her time in the Justice portfolio, and there was some speculation she would eventually be a candidate to succeed Gary Filmon as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. This speculation ended after the Headingly riot, which did serious damage to her political standing. Some &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; journalists noted that street gangs and juvenile crime actually increased during the period of Filmon and Vodrey&#x27;s hardline approach.

===Minister of Culture, Heritage and Citizenship===

Vodrey was reassigned as Minister of Culture, Heritage and Citizenship on January 6, 1997. She retained ministerial responsibility for the Status of Women and was also given responsibility for Multiculturalism and the Liquor Control Act.

In June 1997, Vodrey introduced legislation to change Manitoba&#x27;s access to information rules for the provincial and municipal governments and crown corporations. She also brought forward a companion bill for the protection of personal health records, which was intended to allow Manitoba&#x27;s public health system to be transferred online. Some doctors expressed concern about the latter measure, arguing that patient privacy could not be ensured. The access to information bill was expected to be less controversial but was nonetheless met with opposition from journalists and others who argued that it would reduce public access to government files, and to electronic files in particular. Vodrey revised the bill in response to this criticism.

Vodrey announced several cultural grants in the summer of 1997, including $1.5 million to the Franco-Manitoban Heritage Centre and $400,000 to the Portage Community Centre Inc. In June 1998, she appointed a Ministerial Millennium Advisory Committee to advise on the best ways of celebrating the millennium. Vodrey changed the governance structure of Manitoba Film and Sound in late 1998, establishing a nine-member board appointed by the provincial government. One of her final acts in office was to oversee a financial bailout of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra.

Vodrey also oversaw Manitoba&#x27;s immigration policy during her time as Minister of Culture. In 1998, the province received a $7 million funding increase for immigration from the federal government and was given a direct role in recruitment strategies. In early 1998, Vodrey and three other politicians were awarded robes of honour from Winnipeg&#x27;s Sikh community.

===Minister responsible for the Status of Women===

In 1995, Vodrey introduced a $50,000 scholarship program for women entering high-technology fields at Manitoba community colleges. Female enrollment in these programs was very low at the time. In the same year, she was an official observer at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China. She announced an anti-stalking initiative in 1996, allowing Manitobans to remove their names from provincial land title documents as a means of keeping their addresses confidential.

In 1996, journalist Lindor Reynolds wrote that Vodrey had a mixed record of effectiveness on women&#x27;s issues. Reynolds noted that Manitoba&#x27;s domestic abuse committee, started by former Justice Minister Jim McCrae, was shut down after Vodrey became Justice Minister in 1993. However, she commended Vodrey for releasing a 50-page guide entitled &quot;Stop The Violence&quot; that was used by women&#x27;s shelters, crisis workers, doctor&#x27;s offices and counsellors.

===Minister responsible for the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission===

Vodrey introduced a review of the province&#x27;s four existing private wine stores in May 1997. The following year, she announced that the Filmon government would begin licensing private sales throughout the province. Jim Maloway of the New Democratic Party described this as &quot;privatization by stealth&quot;, and expressed concern that the province would eventually privatize the Liquor Control Commission.

==Federal politics==

Vodrey was co-chair of Kim Campbell&#x27;s Manitoba campaign in 1993, during her ultimately successful bid to succeed Brian Mulroney as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

==Out of politics==

Vodrey announced in March 1999 that she would not be a candidate in the next provincial election. She formally resigned from cabinet with the rest of the Filmon ministry on October 5, 1999, following the appointment of an NDP government that formalized the result of the election. She supported Stuart Murray&#x27;s successful bid to succeed Gary Filmon as Progressive Conservative leader in 2000, and later endorsed Hugh McFadyen&#x27;s successful campaign to succeed Murray in 2006. She supported Sam Katz&#x27;s campaign for re-election as Mayor of Winnipeg in 2006.

Vodrey was appointed to a two-year term on the Board of Directors of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 2002 and was re-appointed in 2004, 2006 and 2008. She has also served on the board of the Misericordia Health Centre (MHC) Foundation. In 2003, Vodrey took part in a seminar entitled &quot;Election Readiness for Women&quot;.

She was appointed as the Manitoba-Saskatchewan representative on the Canada Council for the Arts in April 2009.

<text>Céline and Julie Go Boating () is a 1974 French film directed by Jacques Rivette. The film stars Dominique Labourier as Julie and Juliet Berto as Céline.

It won the Special Prize of the Jury at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1974 and was an Official Selection at the 1974 New York Film Festival.

==Plot==
The film begins with Julie sitting on a park bench reading a book of magic spells when a woman (Céline) walks past and begins dropping various possessions (à la Lewis Carroll&#x27;s White Rabbit). Julie starts picking them up and tries to follow Céline around Paris, sometimes at a fast pace (for instance, sprinting up Montmartre to keep up with Céline&#x27;s tram). After adventures following Céline through the Parisian streets—at one point it seems as though they have gone their separate ways, never to meet again—Céline finally decides to move in with Julie. There are incidents of identity swapping, with Céline pretending to be Julie to meet the latter&#x27;s childhood sweetheart, for example, and Julie attempting to substitute for Céline at a cabaret audition.

The second half of the film focuses on the duo&#x27;s individual visits to 7 bis, rue du Nadir-aux-Pommes, the address of a mansion set in quiet, walled-off grounds in Paris. Although seemingly empty and closed in the present day, the house is where Céline realises she knows as the place where she works as a nanny for a family—two jealous sisters, one widower, and a sickly child. Soon, a repetitive pattern emerges: Céline or Julie enters the house, disappears for a time, and then is suddenly ejected by unseen hands back to present-day Paris later that same day. Each time either Céline or Julie is exhausted, having forgotten everything that has happened during their time in the house. However, each time upon returning by taxi, the women discover a candy mysteriously lodged in their mouth. It seems important, so each ensures to carefully save the candy. At one point, they realise that the candy is a key to the other place and time; sucking on the sweet transports them back to the house&#x27;s alternative reality (a double reference to both Lewis Carroll and Marcel Proust&#x27;s madeleine) of the day&#x27;s events.

The remainder of the film consists of the two women attempting to solve the central mystery of the house: amid the jealous conniving of the women of the house over the attentions of the widower, a young child is mysteriously murdered. However, this narrative repeats like a stage play, with exact phrases they soon learn well enough to start joking about. Each time they eat the candy, they remember more of the day&#x27;s events. Just as when reading a favourite novel or watching a beloved movie, they find they can enter the narrative itself, with each twist and turn memorised. Far from being the passive viewers/readers they were at first—and most movie viewers always are—the women come to realise that they can seize hold of the story, changing it as they wish.

Now, even as the plot continues to unfold in its clockwork fashion, the women begin to take control, making it &quot;interactive&quot; by altering their dialogues and inserting different actions into the events unravelling in the house. Finally, in a true act of authorship, they change the ending and rescue the young girl who was originally murdered. Both realities fully conjoin when, after their rescue of the girl from the House of Fiction, the two not only find themselves transported back to Julie&#x27;s apartment, but this time it isn&#x27;t another &quot;waking dream&quot;—for the young girl, Madlyn, has joined them, safely back in 1970s Paris.

To relax, Céline, Julie, and Madlyn take a rowboat on a placid river, rowing and gliding happily along, but something isn&#x27;t quite right. They fall silent upon seeing another boat quickly passing them on the water. On that boat, we see the three main protagonists from the house of another time: that alternate reality has followed them back to their world. But Céline, Julie, and Madlyn see them as the antique props they are, frozen in place.

The film ends as we watch Céline, half nodding off on a park bench, catch sight of Julie hurrying past her, who, in her White Rabbit way, drops her magic book. Picking it up, she calls out and runs after Julie.

==Themes==
Magic is one of the themes of the film. Céline, the stage magician, does her magic tricks in a nightclub performance. Magic seems to come too from Julie&#x27;s Tarot card readings. Finally, &quot;real&quot; magic comes from the design of a potion, which enables both women to enter the house and take charge of the narrative.

At the start, the two women are leading relatively conventional lives, each having jobs (Julie, a librarian, is more conservative and sensible than Céline, a stage magician, with her bohemian lifestyle). As the film develops, Céline and Julie separate from the world by leaving their jobs, moving in together, and gradually becoming obsessed with the mysterious and magical events in the old house.

In one scene, according to critic Irina Janakievska, Julie is playing Tarot cards, with one of the cards interpreted as signifying that Julie&#x27;s future is behind her—exactly when we see Céline, wearing a disguise, observing Julie from one of the library desks. As Céline draws an outline of her hand in one of the books, Julie echoes that as she plays with a red ink pad.

Another noticeable aspect of the film is its use of puns. For instance, the title &quot;Céline et Julie vont en bateau&quot; has other meanings from that of taking a boat ride: &quot;aller en bateau&quot; also means &quot;to get caught up in a story that someone is telling you&quot; or, in English, getting taken up in a &quot;shaggy dog story&quot;.

<text>The Million Mom March was a rally held on Mother&#x27;s Day, May 14, 2000 in the Washington, D.C. National Mall by the Million Mom March organization to call for stricter gun control. The march reportedly drew an estimated attendance of 500,000 to 750,000 people at the D.C. location, however, &quot;The Park Police estimated turnout for that event at 300,000.&quot; Including 150,000 to 200,000 people holding satellite events in more than 70 cities across the country, the total number of participants was about one million. 

A counter-rally by the pro-firearm Second Amendment Sisters, was also held on the same day and drew approximately 2,500 people.

==History==
The Million Mom March began as a grassroots movement sparked by Donna Dees-Thomases after she viewed broadcast coverage of the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting in Granada Hills, California. In October 1999, she and several Tri-State activists from the New York metropolitan area held a news conference in Manhattan, where they announced their intent to march in Washington. The march was held on May 14, 2000 to coincide with Mother&#x27;s Day, with the organization reporting a turnout of 750,000 supporters. Following the event the organization became chapter-based and merged with the victim-led pro-gun control group Bell Campaign. In 2001 the Million Mom March organization merged with the Brady Campaign.

On the anniversary of the first march, more than 100 rallies were held across the nation calling for stricter gun laws at the state level. In New York, Republican Governor George Pataki joined Democratic U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in a show of support for stricter gun laws. Turnouts to the second Washington march and to further marches were diminished, with the 2001 march on Washington reporting about 200 in attendance. The group did not plan demonstrations in Washington in 2002 or 2003, instead focusing its efforts in the states.

==Debate==
Gun rights advocates have routinely challenged the Million Mom March on its use of statistics on child gun casualties with individuals and organizations on both sides of the gun debate either verifying or criticizing the group&#x27;s data. In 2004, Wendy McElroy estimated that only 5,732 children under the age of 17 died in gun related deaths, &quot;or roughly 40 percent of what MMM asserts.&quot;

An investigation by &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the incidence of accidental child firearm deaths occur &quot;roughly twice as often as the records indicate&quot; due to idiosyncrasies in how authorities in various states classify these incidents. The report also asserted that the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups utilize the lower statistics in order to lobby against more restrictive gun laws.

<doc id="1112660" wikidata="Q4703684" url="?curid=1112660" title="Al Clouston">
<text>Alwyn Vey Clouston (1910 – October 27, 2004 in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada) was a Canadian storyteller and humorist known as &quot;Uncle Al.&quot;

He was popular at conventions during the time he worked as a travelling businessman and owner of John Clouston Ltd. of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. He retired in 1975 and became a best-selling author of comedy books. In 1980, his comedy album &quot;Cinderelly&quot; was nominated for a Canadian Juno Award. His other albums included &quot;Spinnin&#x27; Yarns&quot; and &quot;Come &#x27;er till I tell You&quot;.

Clouston married Ida Bridden at St. John&#x27;s Topsail Anglican Church on November 25, 1933, and they remained together until her death. Clouston died aged 94, and was survived by their two children (Carol Ann and Ian Bridden; died 2008), four grandchildren (Nancy, Doug, John, and Elizabeth), and five great-grandchildren.

Alwyn was the son of John Clouston, grandson of Thomas Clouston (both of St. John&#x27;s), and the great-grandson of John Clouston, a stonemason from Kirkwall, Orkney (early 19th century).

He was almost certainly related (at least distantly) to Brian Clouston, Sir Edward Clouston, 1st Baronet, Storer Clouston and William Alexander Clouston, as the surname Clouston is (according to Storer Clouston in his book &quot;Family of Clouston&quot;) exclusive to descendants of Haakon Harvardson Klo, from whom the name derives. However, this is not supported by official records. All that can be correctly stated is that he had the same surname as these Cloustons.

<doc id="1112669" wikidata="Q1382986" url="?curid=1112669" title="Rocket Knight Adventures">
<text>is a platform game developed and published by Konami for the Sega Genesis. The game involves Sparkster, a possum knight who wields a rocket pack and sword that can emit energy projectiles as he attempts to stop the Devotindos Empire, an evil empire that attempts to break the seal of a powerful starship.

&quot;Rocket Knight Adventures&quot; was designed by Nobuya Nakazato, designer of &quot;Contra&quot; games such as &quot;The Alien Wars&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. It was released in Japan and North America in August 1993 and in Europe in September. Upon release, the game received positive reviews.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Rocket Knight Adventures&quot; is a side-scrolling platform game where the player guides Sparkster through linear levels. The player can jump and attack using Sparkster&#x27;s sword, which can either hit enemies directly or by emitting energy projectiles that travel a short distance. If the Attack button is held until the blue bar on the top of the screen is filled in, Sparkster will charge a &quot;rocket attack&quot;. When the player lets go of the Attack button, Sparkster will perform a rocket attack where he bursts into one of eight directions where the player has inputted on the directional pad or otherwise, a stationary spin attack if no directions are pressed. The rocket attack can be used to rebound off walls, allowing Sparkster to reach higher areas.

Sparkster has a limited amount of vitality that decreases when he is hit by enemies, projectiles or stage hazards. The player will lose one life if either the vitality bar depletes, Sparkster falls into a bottomless pit or outside the stage or touches instant-killing terrain such as spikes in the cart segment of the second stage and the lava at the beginning of the third stage. Sparkster can replenish vitality by collecting apples and bananas, the latter replenishing the most vitality. The amount of vitality replenished depends on the game&#x27;s difficulty level. The game ends if the player runs out of extra lives, however the player is allowed to use a limited number of continues (except in the Very Hard (Crazy Hard in Japan), where there are no continues) and can start at the beginning of the stage where they got a Game Over. Extra lives can be obtained by collecting 1UP items spread throughout some levels; or by achieving 20,000 points, with each other extra life being obtained every 60,000 points.

The game is composed of seven stages, with each stage composed of several sections and each one ending with a boss fight. Levels are occasionally switched up with alternate styles of gameplay. Some sections of the game are played similar to horizontal scrolling shooters (akin to &quot;Gradius&quot;, often with in-level references to that game), while the boss fight of the fifth stage has the player controlling a large robot mech to duel with the antagonist Axel Gear.

The game features four difficulty options, with harder difficulties increasing the power of the enemy attacks and reducing the number of lives and continues the player starts with; the hardest starting with no lives and continues, and enemy attacks defeating Sparkster in one hit. The difficulty levels in the game are differently presented in each regional version of the game. Both the Japanese and European versions have two difficulty levels accessible normally via the options menu; while all four difficulties are enabled by default in the American version.

== Plot ==
The first king of Zephyrus (labelled as Zebulos in the international manuals), El Zephyrus (El Zebulos internationally) had led his clan to defeating an evil empire who had constructed a starship known as the Pig Star, which had the power to destroy planets. Knowing the Pig Star would be sought by the evil, the King had magically sealed the starship and protected the &quot;Key to the Seal&quot; by having it guarded and passed by his royal family over generations, and forming an elite group of warriors known as the Rocket Knights to protect the kingdom. Around this time, an orphan named Sparkster was taken in by Mifune Sanjulo; a friend of the King, and current leader of the Rocket Knights. Sparkster was trained to become a Rocket Knight at an early age and would become the new leader of the Rocket Knights after banishing Axel Gear from Zephyrus, a corrupt &quot;Black Knight&quot;, for destroying Mifune.

In the events of the game, the kingdom of Zephyrus is invaded by a tribe of pigs known as the Devotindos Empire, led by Emperor Devilgus Devotindos; who has come in search for the key to the seal of the Pig Star. Sparkster heads to the Zephyrus castle to find Axel Gear kidnapping Princess Sherry, who is the one who knows the location to the key. Before Sparkster is able to catch Axel, Axel escapes into a large airship and blows Sparkster away to a nearby desert, prompting Sparkster to chase Axel. Sparkster eventually reaches the Kingdom of Devotindos, and reaches the Devontindos castle to confront Devilgus. Sparkster frees Sherry, while Devilgus escapes into space with the seal key to reach the Pig Star. Sherry casts a spell on Sparkster&#x27;s rocket pack that allows him to fly in space and reach the Pig Star. Reaching the Pig Star, Sparkster confronts Devilgus in a melee fight; the former destroys Devilgus, who is revealed to be a robot. After a melee fight with Axel Gear which results in his defeat, Sparkster eventually confronts the Pig Star&#x27;s core, whom was the commanding force of the Devilgus. Sparkster defeats the Core, which triggers a chain reaction that leads to the destruction of the Pig Star.

Sparkster escapes the crumbling fortress in a nearby escape pod, however the Pig Star Core also escapes; the robot chases Sparkster&#x27;s escape pod in a last-ditch effort to kill Sparkster. the Core burns apart while entering Elhorn&#x27;s atmosphere while Sparkster lands back safely in Zephyrus, reunites Princess Sherry with King Zephyrus and flies off elsewhere.

== Reception ==

&quot;Rocket Knight Adventures&quot; was well received by critics, who praised the music and graphics. HonestGamers gave the game a 9/10. Sega-16 gave it the same mark, saying that &quot;it is not only one of the system&#x27;s best titles, it&#x27;s one of the greatest platformers ever made&quot;.

== Legacy ==
A SNES version of &quot;Rocket Knight Adventures&quot; was planned but was never released.

The Sparkster character would be advertised as Konami&#x27;s mascot, appearing on several Konami advertisements and game manuals for a few years following the game&#x27;s release.

The game would be followed by a direct sequel, &quot;&quot; on the Sega Genesis in 1994. A spin-off game, &quot;Sparkster&quot;, was released in the same year for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A revival of the series, &quot;Rocket Knight&quot; was released in 2010, developed by British studio Climax Group and was released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Steam. A compilation of the first three games, titled &quot;Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked&quot;, was released in June 2024 by Limited Run Games for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch.

Sparkster has appeared as a playable character in games such as &quot;New International Track &amp; Field&quot; for Nintendo DS and &quot;Krazy Kart Racing&quot; for iPhone and iPod Touch. He also has cameos in &quot;Ganbare Goemon 2: Kiteretsu Shōgun Magginesu&quot; for the SNES, &quot;Snatcher&quot; for the Mega-CD, &quot;Jikkyō Power Pro Wrestling &#x27;96: Max Voltage&quot; for the SNES, and &quot;Mitsumete Knight&quot; for the PlayStation. He was disguised by Pastel in &quot;TwinBee PARADISE in Donburishima&quot; for PC, and a figure resembling him also appears in an alternate ending to &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation 2, and as nonogram pixel on &quot;Pixel Puzzle Collection&quot; for the iPhone and Android.

<doc id="1112691" wikidata="Q4881918" url="?curid=1112691" title="Belarus Democracy Act of 2004">
<text>The Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 is a United States federal law that authorizes assistance for political parties, non-governmental organizations, and independent media working to advance democracy and human rights in Belarus. The act was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, by voice vote, on October 4, 2004; was passed by the U.S. Senate, by unanimous consent, on October 6, 2004; and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 20, 2004. It is codified, as amended, at 22 U.S.C. 5811 note.

The law expresses the sense of Congress that the Belarusian authorities should not receive various types of non-humanitarian financial aid from the U.S. It also calls for the President to report to Congress on arms sales by Belarus to state sponsors of terrorism and on the personal wealth and assets of senior Belarus officials.

The U.S., said President Bush in his signing statement of October 20, 2004, &quot;will work with our allies and partners to assist those seeking to return Belarus to its rightful place among the Euro-Atlantic community of democracies.&quot;

All three bills were introduced by Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey.

Earlier versions of the act that were introduced in 2001 and 2003 but not enacted into law were more severe, prohibiting travel of Belarusian officials, freezing assets, blocking certain trade, and referring to the role of Russia.

==Aftermath==
Spokesman Richard Boucher of the U.S. Department of State stated, according to an October 26, 2004 editorial in the &quot;Voice of America&quot;, that the U.S. was concerned about the Belarusian government&#x27;s increasingly repressive steps against independent news media and pro-democracy groups. He further stated that Belarusian security forces used excessive force against peaceful protesters following the parliamentary elections and referendum.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and his government were highly displeased with the passage of the act.

On December 8, 2006, the United States House of Representatives passed, and (following Senate enactment) on January 12, 2007, President Bush signed into law, the Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act of 2006, a statute amending and updating the act.

On January 3, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Belarus Democracy and Human Rights Act of 2011, further amending and updating the act.

<text>Ben Sveinson (born August 4, 1945) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1990 to 1999 as a Progressive Conservative.

The son of August Sveinson and Mary Gibson, he was born in Spearhill, Manitoba. He attended secondary school in Moosehorn, and did not attend university. He subsequently worked as a federal meat inspector, and operated businesses in towing, security and TV antenna installation. In 1967, Sveinson married Millie Prokopich.

Sveinson was elected as a school trustee in Seine River in 1986, and re-elected in 1989. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the general election of 1990, beating his nearest opponent by about 1,000 votes in the rural southeastern riding of La Verendrye.

Sveinson was re-elected in 1995 by about 2,000 votes over his nearest opponent. He was never appointed to Premier Gary Filmon&#x27;s cabinet, though he did serve as Deputy Chair of Committees for a time.

The Progressive Conservatives, who had governed the province since 1988, were defeated by the New Democratic Party in the 1999 provincial election. Sveinson was upset in La Verendrye, losing to NDP candidate Ron Lemieux by 166 votes. Sveinson did not seek to return to office in 2003.

Following his defeat, Sveinson joined the real estate firm Century 21. He also joined the federal Progressive Conservative riding association executive in the riding of Provencher. In 2003, he led the executive in a unanimous vote &quot;against&quot; a political merger with the Canadian Alliance, and declared his support for Joe Clark&#x27;s (ultimately unsuccessful) attempts to prevent the merger.

<doc id="1112702" wikidata="Q1975546" url="?curid=1112702" title="Royal forest">
<text>A royal forest, occasionally known as a kingswood (), is an area of land with different definitions in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The term &quot;forest&quot; in the ordinary modern understanding refers to an area of wooded land; however, the original medieval sense was closer to the modern idea of a &quot;preserve&quot; – i.e. land legally set aside for specific purposes such as royal hunting – with less emphasis on its composition. There are also differing and contextual interpretations in Continental Europe derived from the Carolingian and Merovingian legal systems.

In Anglo-Saxon England, though the kings were great huntsmen, they never set aside areas declared to be &quot;outside&quot; (Latin &quot;foris&quot;) the law of the land. Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c. 500 to 1066) creating forests. However, under the Norman kings (after 1066), by royal prerogative forest law was widely applied. The law was designed to protect the &quot;venison and the vert&quot;. In this sense, &quot;venison&quot; meant &quot;noble&quot; animals of the chase – notably red and fallow deer, the roe deer, and wild boar – and &quot;vert&quot; meant the greenery that sustained them. Forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or (by invitation) the aristocracy. The concept was introduced by the Normans to England in the 11th century, and at the height of this practice in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, fully one-third of the land area of Southern England was designated as royal forest. At one stage in the 12th century, all of Essex was afforested. On accession Henry II declared all of Huntingdonshire to be a royal forest.

Afforestation, in particular the creation of the New Forest, figured large in the folk history of the &quot;Norman yoke&quot;, which magnified what was already a grave social ill: &quot;the picture of prosperous settlements disrupted, houses burned, peasants evicted, all to serve the pleasure of the foreign tyrant, is a familiar element in the English national story ... The extent and intensity of hardship and of depopulation have been exaggerated&quot;, H. R. Loyn observed. Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed any of a range of offences within the forests; by the mid-17th century, enforcement of this law had died out, but many of England&#x27;s woodlands still bore the title &quot;Royal Forest&quot;. During the Middle Ages, the practice of reserving areas of land for the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe.

Royal forests usually included large areas of heath, grassland and wetland – anywhere that supported deer and other game. In addition, when an area was initially designated forest, any villages, towns and fields that lay within it were also subject to forest law. This could foster resentment as the local inhabitants were then restricted in the use of land they had previously relied upon for their livelihoods; however, common rights were not extinguished, but merely curtailed.

==Areas chosen for royal forests==

The areas that became royal forests were already relatively wild and sparsely populated, and can be related to specific geographic features that made them harder to work as farmland.

In the South West of England, forests extended across the Upper Jurassic Clay Vale. In the Midlands, the clay plain surrounding the River Severn was heavily wooded. Clay soils in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire formed another belt of woodlands. In Hampshire, Berkshire and Surrey, woodlands were established on sandy, gravelly, acid soils. In the Scots Highlands, a &quot;deer forest&quot; generally has no trees at all.

Marshlands in Lincolnshire were afforested. Upland moors too were chosen, such as Dartmoor and Exmoor in the South West, and the Peak Forest of Derbyshire. The North Yorkshire moors, a sandstone plateau, had a number of royal forests.

== Forest law ==

William the Conqueror, a great lover of hunting, established the system of forest law. This operated outside the common law, and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from destruction. In the year of his death, 1087, a poem, &quot;The Rime of King William&quot;, inserted in the Peterborough Chronicle, expresses English indignation at the forest laws.

=== Offences ===
Offences in forest law were divided into two categories: trespass against the vert (the vegetation of the forest) and trespass against the venison (the game).

The five animals of the forest protected by law were given by Manwood as the hart and hind (i.e. male and female red deer), boar, hare and wolf. (In England, the boar became extinct in the wild by the 13th century, and the wolf by the late 15th century.) Protection was also said to be extended to the beasts of chase, namely the buck and (fallow deer), fox, marten, and roe deer, and the beasts and fowls of warren: the hare, coney, pheasant, and partridge. In addition, inhabitants of the forest were forbidden to bear hunting weapons, and dogs were banned from the forest; mastiffs were permitted as watchdogs, but they had to have their front claws removed to prevent them from hunting game. The rights of chase and of warren (i.e. to hunt such beasts) were often granted to local nobility for a fee, but were a separate concept.

Trespasses against the vert were extensive: they included &quot;purpresture&quot;, &quot;assarting&quot;, clearing forest land for agriculture, and felling trees or clearing shrubs, among others. These laws applied to any land within the boundary of the forest, even if it were freely owned; although the Charter of the Forest in 1217 established that all freemen owning land within the forest enjoyed the rights of &quot;agistment&quot; and &quot;pannage&quot;. Under the forest laws, bloody hand was a kind of trespass by which the offender, being apprehended and found with his hands or other body part stained with blood, is judged to have killed the deer, even though he was not found hunting or chasing.

Disafforested lands on the edge of the forest were known as purlieus; agriculture was permitted here and deer escaping from the forest into them were permitted to be killed if causing damage.

=== Rights and privileges ===
Payment for access to certain rights could provide a useful source of income. Local nobles could be granted a royal licence to take a certain amount of game. The common inhabitants of the forest might, depending on their location, possess a variety of rights: &quot;estover&quot;, the right of taking firewood; &quot;pannage&quot;, the right to pasture swine in the forest; &quot;turbary&quot;, the right to cut turf (as fuel); and various other rights of pasturage (&quot;agistment&quot;) and harvesting the products of the forest. Land might be disafforested entirely, or permission given for assart and purpresture.

=== Officers ===
The justices of the forest were the justices in eyre and the verderers.

The chief royal official was the warden. As he was often an eminent and preoccupied magnate, his powers were frequently exercised by a deputy. He supervised the foresters and under-foresters, who personally went about preserving the forest and game and apprehending offenders against the law. The agisters supervised pannage and agistment and collected any fees thereto appertaining. The nomenclature of the officers can be somewhat confusing: the rank immediately below the constable was referred to as foresters-in-fee, or, later, &quot;woodwards&quot;, who held land in the forest in exchange for rent, and advised the warden. They exercised various privileges within their bailiwicks. Their subordinates were the under-foresters, later referred to as rangers. The rangers are sometimes said to be patrollers of the purlieu.

Another group, called serjeants-in-fee, and later, foresters-in-fee (not to be confused with the above), held small estates in return for their service in patrolling the forest and apprehending offenders.

The forests also had surveyors, who determined the boundaries of the forest, and &quot;regarders&quot;. These last reported to the court of justice-seat and investigated encroachments on the forest and invasion of royal rights, such as assarting. While their visits were infrequent, due to the interval of time between courts, they provided a check against collusion between the foresters and local offenders.

=== Courts ===
Blackstone gives the following outline of the forest courts, as theoretically constructed:
*Court of attachment, sometimes called the &quot;Forty-Day Court&quot; or &quot;Woodmote&quot;. This court was held every forty days, and was presided over by verderers and the Warden, or his deputy. The foresters attached persons who had committed crimes against the forest law and brought them before this court to have them enrolled; however, it did not possess the power to try or convict individuals, and such cases had to be passed upwards to the swainmote or the court of justice seat.
*Court of regard, held every third year to enforce the law requiring declawing of dogs within the forest.
*Swainmote or &quot;Sweinmote&quot; was held three times a year: the fortnight before the feast of St. Michael, about the feast of St. Martin, and the fortnight before the feast of St. John the Baptist. It was presided over by the Warden and verderers, the foresters and agisters being in attendance. The first two occasions were to regulate agistment and pannage, respectively; the third was for the purpose of trying offenders before a jury of , or freemen of the forest. The name of the court is sometimes said to be derived from swine, probably a misapprehension through its regulation of pannage.
*Court of justice-seat or &quot;eyre&quot; was the highest of the forest courts. It was to be held every three years, to be announced forty days in advance, and was presided over by a justice in eyre. It was, in theory, the only court that could pass sentence upon offenders of the forest laws.

In practice, these fine distinctions were not always observed. In the Forest of Dean, swainmote and the court of attachment seem to have been one and the same throughout most of its history. As the courts of justice-seat were held less frequently, the lower courts assumed the power to fine offenders against the forest laws, according to a fixed schedule. The courts of justice-seat crept into disuse, and in 1817, the office of justice in eyre was abolished and its powers transferred to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests. Courts of swainmote and attachment went out of existence at various dates in the different forests. A Court of Swainmote was re-established in the New Forest in 1877.

== History ==
Since the conquest of England, the forest, chase and warren lands had been exempted from the common law and subject only to the authority of the king, but these customs had faded into obscurity by the time of The Restoration.

===William the Conqueror===
William I, original enactor of the Forest Law in England, did not harshly penalise offenders. The accusation that he &quot;laid a law upon it, that whoever slew hart or hind should be blinded,&quot; according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; is little more than propaganda. William Rufus, also a keen hunter, increased the severity of the penalties for various offences to include death and mutilation. The laws were in part codified under the Assize of the Forest (1184) of Henry II.

===Magna Carta===

Magna Carta, the charter forced upon King John of England by the English barons in 1215, contained five clauses relating to royal forests. They aimed to limit, and even reduce, the King&#x27;s sole rights as enshrined in forest law. The clauses were as follows (taken from translation of the great charter that is the &quot;Magna Carta&quot;):

* (44) People who live outside the forest need not in future appear before the Royal Justices of the Forest in answer to general summonses, unless they are actually involved in proceedings or are sureties for someone who has been seized for a forest offence.
* (47) All forests that have been created in our reign shall at once be disafforested. River-banks that have been enclosed in our reign shall be treated similarly.
* (48) All evil customs relating to forests and warrens, foresters, warreners, sheriffs and their servants, or river-banks and their wardens, are at once to be investigated in every county by twelve sworn knights of the county, and within forty days of their enquiry the evil customs are to be abolished completely and irrevocably. But we, or our chief justice if we are not in England, are first to be informed.
* (52) To any man whom we have deprived or dispossessed of lands, castles, liberties, or rights, without the lawful judgement of his equals, we will at once restore these. In cases of dispute the matter shall be resolved by the judgement of the twenty-five barons referred to below in the clause for securing the peace (§ 61). In cases, however, where a man was deprived or dispossessed of something without the lawful judgement of his equals by our father King Henry or our brother King Richard, and it remains in our hands or is held by others under our warranty, we shall have respite for the period commonly allowed to Crusaders, unless a lawsuit had been begun, or an enquiry had been made at our order, before we took the Cross as a Crusader. On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once render justice in full.
* (53) We shall have similar respite [to that in clause 52] in rendering justice in connexion with forests that are to be disafforested, or to remain forests, when these were first afforested by our father Henry or our brother Richard; with the guardianship of lands in another person&#x27;s `fee&#x27;, when we have hitherto had this by virtue of a `fee&#x27; held of us for knight&#x27;s service by a third party; and with abbeys founded in another person&#x27;s `fee&#x27;, in which the lord of the `fee&#x27; claims to own a right. On our return from the Crusade, or if we abandon it, we will at once do full justice to complaints about these matters.

===Charter of the Forest===

After the death of John, Henry III was compelled to grant the Charter of the Forest (1217), which further reformed the forest law and established the rights of agistment and pannage on private land within the forests. It also checked certain of the extortions of the foresters. An &quot;Ordinance of the Forest&quot; under Edward I again checked the oppression of the officers and introduced sworn juries in the forest courts.

=== Great Perambulation and after ===
In 1300 many (if not all) forests were and reduced greatly in their extent, in theory to their extent in the time of Henry II. However, this depended on the determination of local juries, whose decisions often excluded from the Forest lands described in Domesday Book as within the forest. Successive kings tried to recover the &quot;purlieus&quot; excluded from a forest by the Great Perambulation of 1300. Forest officers periodically fined the inhabitants of the purlieus for failing to attend Forest Court or for forest offences. This led to complaints in Parliament. The king promised to remedy the grievances, but usually did nothing.

Several forests were alienated by Richard II and his successors, but generally the system decayed. Henry VII revived &quot;Swainmotes&quot; (forest courts) for several forests and held Forest Eyres in some of them. Henry VIII in 1547 placed the forests under the Court of Augmentations with two Masters and two Surveyors-General. On the abolition of that court, the two surveyors-general became responsible to the Exchequer. Their respective divisions were north and south of the River Trent.

The last serious exercise of forest law by a court of justice-seat (Forest Eyre) seems to have been in about 1635, in an attempt to raise money.

=== Disafforestation, sale of forest lands and the Western Rising ===
By the Tudor period and after, forest law had largely become anachronistic, and served primarily to protect timber in the royal forests. James I and his ministers Robert Cecil and Lionel Cranfield pursued a policy of increasing revenues from the forests and starting the process of disafforestation.

Cecil made the first steps towards abolition of the forests, as part of James I&#x27;s policy of increasing his income independently of Parliament. Cecil investigated forests that were unused for royal hunting and provided little revenue from timber sales. Knaresborough Forest in Yorkshire was abolished. Revenues in the Forest of Dean were increased through sales of wood for iron smelting. Enclosures were made in Chippenham and Blackmore for herbage and pannage.

Cranfield commissioned surveys into assart lands of various forests, including Feckenham, Sedgemoor and Selwood, laying the foundations of the wide-scale abolition of forests under Charles I. The commissioners appointed raised over £25,000 by compounding with occupiers, whose ownership was confirmed, subject to a fixed rent. Cranfield&#x27;s work led directly to the disafforestation of Gillingham Forest in Dorset and Chippenham and Blackmore in Wiltshire. Additionally, he created the model for the abolition of the forests followed throughout the 1630s.

Each disafforestation would start with a commission from the Exchequer, which would survey the forest, determine the lands belonging to the crown, and negotiate compensation for landowners and tenants whose now-traditional rights to use of the land as commons would be revoked. A legal action by the Attorney General would then proceed in the Court of Exchequer against the forest residents for intrusion, which would confirm the settlement negotiated by the commission. Crown lands would then be granted (leased), usually to prominent courtiers, and often the same figures that had undertaken the commission surveys. Legal complaints about the imposed settlements and compensation were frequent.

The disafforestations caused riots and Skimmington processions resulting in the destruction of enclosures and reoccupation of grazing lands in a number of West Country forests, including Gillingham, Braydon and Dean, known as the Western Rising. Riots also took place in Feckenham, Leicester and Malvern. The riots followed the physical enclosure of lands previously used as commons, and frequently led to the destruction of fencing and hedges. Some were said to have had a &quot;warlike&quot; character, with armed mobs numbering hundreds, for instance in Feckenham. The rioters in Dean fully destroyed the enclosures surrounding 3,000 acres in groups that numbered thousands of participants.

The disturbances tended to involve artisans and cottagers who were not entitled to compensation. The riots were hard to enforce against, due to the lack of efficient militia, and the low-born nature of the participants. Ultimately, however, enclosure succeeded, with the exceptions of Dean and Malvern Chase.

In 1641, Parliament passed the Delimitation of Forests Act 1640 (16 Cha. 1. c. 16, also known as Selden&#x27;s Act) to revert the forest boundaries to the positions they had held at the end of the reign of James I.

=== After the Restoration ===
The Forest of Dean was legally re-established in 1668 by the Dean Forest Act 1667. A Forest Eyre was held for the New Forest in 1670, and a few for other forests in the 1660s and 1670s, but these were the last. From 1715, both surveyors&#x27; posts were held by the same person. The remaining royal forests continued to be managed (in theory, at least) on behalf of the Crown. However, the commoners&#x27; rights of grazing often seem to have been more important than the rights of the Crown.

In the late 1780s, a royal commission was appointed to inquire into the condition of crown woods and those surviving. North of the Trent it found Sherwood Forest survived, south of it: the New Forest, three others in Hampshire, Windsor Forest in Berkshire, the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, Waltham or Epping Forest in Essex, three forests in Northamptonshire, and Wychwood in Oxfordshire. Some of these no longer had swainmote courts thus no official supervision. They divided the remaining forests into two classes, those with and without the Crown as major landowner. In certain Hampshire forests and the Forest of Dean, most of the soil belonged to the Crown and these should be reserved to grow timber, to meet the need for oak for shipbuilding. The others would be inclosed, the Crown receiving an &quot;allotment&quot; (compensation) in lieu of its rights.

In 1810, responsibility for woods was moved from Surveyors-General (who accounted to the Auditors of Land Revenue) to a new Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues. From 1832 to 1851 &quot;Works and Buildings&quot; were added to their responsibilities. In 1851, the commissioners again became a Commissioner of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues. In 1924, the Royal Forests were transferred to the new Forestry Commission (now Forestry England).

== Surviving ancient forests ==
=== Forest of Dean ===

The Forest of Dean was used as a source of charcoal for ironmaking within the Forest from 1612 until about 1670. It was the subject of a Reafforestation Act in 1667. Courts continued to be held at the Speech House, for example, to regulate the activities of the Freeminers. The sale of cordwood for charcoal continued until at least the late 18th century. Deer were removed in 1850. The forest is today heavily wooded, as is a substantial formerly privately owned area to the west, now treated as part of the forest. It is managed by Forestry England.

=== Epping &amp; Hainault Forests ===
Epping and Hainault Forest are surviving remnants of the Royal Forest of Waltham. The extent of Epping and Hainault Forests was greatly reduced by inclosure by landowners. The Hainault Forest Act 1851 was passed by Parliament, ending the Royal protection for Hainault Forest. Within six weeks 3000 acres of woodland was cleared. The Corporation of London wished to see Epping Forest preserved as an open space and obtained an injunction in 1874 to throw open some that had been inclosed in the preceding 20 years. In 1875 and 1876, the corporation bought of open wasteland. Under the Epping Forest Act 1878, the forest was disafforested and forest law was abolished in respect of it. Instead, the corporation was appointed as Conservators of the Forest. The forest is managed through the Epping Forest Committee.

=== New Forest ===

The New Forest is home to the British cultural minority known as New Forest Commoners. An Act was passed to remove the deer in 1851, but abandoned when it was realised that the deer were needed to keep open the unwooded &quot;lawns&quot; of the forest. An attempt was made to develop the forest for growing wood by a rolling programme of inclosures. In 1875, a Select committee of the House of Commons recommended against this, leading to the passage of the New Forest Act 1877, which limited the Crown&#x27;s right to inclose, regulated common rights, and reconstituted the Court of Verderers. A further Act was passed in 1964. This forest is also managed by Forestry England.

===Sherwood Forest===

A forest since the end of the Ice Age (as attested by pollen sampling cores), Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve today encompasses 423.2 hectares, (1,045 acres) surrounding the village of Edwinstowe, the site of Thoresby Hall.

The core of the forest is the Special Area of Conservation named Birklands and Bilhaugh. It is a remnant of an older, much larger, royal hunting forest, which derived its name from its status as the &quot;shire (or sher) wood&quot; of Nottinghamshire, which extended into several neighbouring counties (shires), bordered on the west along the River Erewash and the Forest of East Derbyshire. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, the forest covered perhaps a quarter of Nottinghamshire in woodland and heath subject to the forest laws.

<text>The All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA) is a trade union of teachers in Indian state of West Bengal.

==History==
ABTA was founded under the leadership of Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy on 6 February 1921. It was the first such association of teachers in Asia.

Following the independence of India, ABTA&#x27;s structure was reformed in 1952. The union also underwent several splits, with the Headmasters&#x27; Association and the West Bengal Teachers&#x27; Association being the first to leave the union.

Satyapriya Roy was its general secretary from 1953 to 1964.

In early 2022, ABTA protested an alleged plan by the government of West Bengal to run education in the state as a public–private partnership.

<text>Stadacona was a 16th-century St. Lawrence Iroquoian village not far from where Quebec City was founded in 1608.

==History==
French explorer and navigator Jacques Cartier, while travelling and charting the Saint Lawrence River, reached the village of Stadacona in July 1534. At the time, the village chief was Donnacona, who showed Cartier five scalps taken in their war with the Toudaman (likely the Miꞌkmaq), a neighbouring people who had attacked one of their forts the previous spring, killing 200 inhabitants. Despite efforts by the people of the village, Cartier seized some inhabitants and their chief, but later released Donnacona, who agreed for his two sons, Taignoagny and Domagaya, to return with Cartier to France for a year.

Cartier returned to Stadacona with Donnacona&#x27;s sons on his next voyage in 1535–1536, where he recorded a word they had used to refer to their home: &quot;They call a town, Kanata&quot; (Canada). When he and his crew stayed over the winter, they were effectively saved by the Stadaconans, who knew how to prepare for them a Vitamin C-rich broth as a cure for scurvy that had developed among the Cartier&#x27;s crew, killing a quarter of them. The same winter, more than 50 Iroquois of the village died from viral and bacterial diseases carried by the Europeans. After this, Cartier seized Donnacona, his sons, and seven other inhabitants, and took them back to France, where nine of the ten died. None ever returned. Five years later, Cartier came back to Stadacona in 1543 to find the village abandoned and destroyed by an unknown enemy, likely due to devastating wars by the Mohawk of the Iroquois or Haudenosaunee confederacy (Five Nations) to the south situated near Lake Ontario.

Samuel de Champlain later chose the location of the village to establish the colony of l&#x27;Habitation, which eventually grew into the city of Québec.

<text>Chicago X (affectionately called &quot;the Chocolate Album&quot; by fans) is the eighth studio album by the American rock band Chicago. It was recorded at Caribou Ranch and it was released by Columbia Records on June 14, 1976. The album made it to number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 21, 1976, a week after its release. It was the band&#x27;s first album to be certified platinum, on September 14, 1976, and has since been certified multi-platinum. In honor of the group&#x27;s platinum album achievement, Columbia Records awarded the group a 25-pound bar of pure platinum, made by Cartier. (&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported it as a 30-pound bar.)

&quot;Chicago X&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year, and won a Grammy Award for Best Album Package.

The album produced Chicago&#x27;s first number one single in the United States, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;. The single went on to win two Grammy Awards: for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus, the band&#x27;s first Grammy Award; and for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalists, for arrangers James William Guercio and Jimmie Haskell. It was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year.

The two other songs released from the album as singles also charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; &quot;Another Rainy Day in New York City&quot; made it to number 32 and &quot;You Are On My Mind&quot; went to number 49.

&quot;Record World&quot; called &quot;You Are on My Mind&quot; &quot;another &quot;Chicago X&quot; showstopper.&quot;

After recording &quot;Chicago VIII&quot; in a state of exhaustion, Chicago did not return to the studio until the spring of 1976, feeling refreshed after a substantial break away. &quot;Chicago X&quot; was released on June 14, 1976, to a receptive audience, giving Chicago a number three album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, and their first album to chart in the UK in years, at number 21. This was the group&#x27;s most pop-oriented effort up to that point given that every song on the album starts with the 3-minute mark, coming in stark contrast to the lengthier and more complex compositions of the albums that had preceded it.

The album featured two top forty singles: Robert Lamm&#x27;s composition, &quot;Another Rainy Day In New York City&quot;, which peaked at number 32 after a brief run in August 1976; and Peter Cetera&#x27;s composition, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first number one single in October of that same year. Originally written at the same time as &quot;Chicago VII&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot;, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; was one of the last to be completed and, according to reports, was very nearly left off the final product. Band member Walter Parazaider has been quoted as saying he heard the song on the radio while cleaning his pool and initially thought &quot;it sounded like McCartney,&quot; not realizing it was his own band&#x27;s work. The song became the band&#x27;s first number one hit in the US and the UK. Some band members felt the song&#x27;s success changed the public&#x27;s perception of the band, leading to more demand from Columbia Records for ballads, although Robert Lamm has since acknowledged that the band had started moving away from their politically-oriented music into the mainstream years earlier, beginning with 1972&#x27;s &quot;Chicago V&quot;.

Band members who normally were not vocalists received vocal credits on this album. The album is notable for the lead vocal debut of trombonist James Pankow. Different band singers tried &quot;You Are On My Mind,&quot; but Pankow felt they were not nailing it the way he heard it in his head as the song&#x27;s composer, so producer Guercio said, &quot;You sing it,&quot; and that effort landed on the final album. &quot;You Are On My Mind&quot; was the third single for the album, reaching number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in April 1977. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of it that &quot;[t]he same mellow vocal blend is here, along with a velvety texture on the horns, but the rhythm section has speeded into a quick samba, decorated with colorful percussion.&quot; Lee Loughnane contributed the lead vocal for his song &quot;Together Again&quot;. (Both Pankow and Loughnane would contribute lead vocals again on the next album, &quot;Chicago XI&quot;.) The brief vocal section of &quot;You Get It Up&quot; was sung by the entire band in unison — thus the album&#x27;s atypical crediting of Danny Seraphine, Walter Parazaider, and Laudir de Oliveira with &quot;vocals&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Chicago X&quot; was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records with an early rendition of &quot;Chicago XIV&quot;&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Rich&quot; by Lamm, as well as Kath&#x27;s &quot;Your Love&#x27;s An Attitude&quot; — both cut in 1975 — as bonus tracks. This album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic.

== Packaging ==
Designed by Art Director of Columbia/CBS Records, John Berg, the album art depicts a partially unwrapped chocolate bar with the Chicago logo on it, resembling a Hershey&#x27;s chocolate bar as it was packaged at the time, and winning for Berg a Grammy Award for Best Album Package. The cover design is labeled &quot;chocolate bar&quot; on the band&#x27;s official web site. The cover art was included in a 2012-2013 exhibit of Berg&#x27;s album covers at Guild Hall of East Hampton, and is now in the permanent collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

== Critical reception ==
Zachary Houle writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot; in 2010 said. &quot;It is an album of pop perfection...&quot; 

In 2016 Jeff Giles wrote, &quot;&#x27;Chicago X&quot; may have arrived on June 14, 1976 with a little more spark and overall energy than you might expect from a group that had been on the road for a decade, but it lacked the compositional depth and musical muscle they&#x27;d shown earlier in their career. It was essentially a pop album — not a bad one, outside the somewhat lyrically dunderheaded &quot;Skin Tight&quot; and &quot;You Get It Up,&quot; but one that couldn&#x27;t help but feel a little light when held up against the double-LP sets of years past.&#x27;

<doc id="1112725" wikidata="Q407666" url="?curid=1112725" title="Barium nitrate">
<text>Barium nitrate is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ba(NO3)2. It, like most barium salts, is colorless, toxic, and water-soluble. It burns with a green flame and is an oxidizer; the compound is commonly used in pyrotechnics.

==Manufacture, occurrence, and reactions==
Barium nitrate is manufactured by two processes that start with the main source material for barium, the carbonate. The first involves dissolving barium carbonate in nitric acid, allowing any iron impurities to precipitate, then filtered, evaporated, and crystallized. The second requires combining barium sulfide with nitric acid.

It occurs naturally as the very rare mineral nitrobarite.

At elevated temperatures, barium nitrate decomposes to barium oxide:

==Applications==
Barium nitrate is used in the production of BaO-containing materials.
===Military===
Although no longer produced, Baratol is an explosive composed of barium nitrate, TNT and binder; the high density of barium nitrate results in baratol being quite dense as well. Barium nitrate mixed with aluminium powder, a formula for flash powder, is highly explosive. It is mixed with thermite to form Thermate-TH3, used in military thermite grenades. Barium nitrate was also a primary ingredient in the &quot;SR 365&quot; incendiary charge used by the British in the &quot;De Wilde&quot; incendiary ammunition with which they armed their interceptor fighters, such as the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, during the Battle of Britain. It is also used in the manufacturing process of barium oxide, the vacuum tube industry and for green fire in pyrotechnics.

==Safety==

Like all soluble barium compounds, barium nitrate is toxic by ingestion or inhalation.

Solutions of sulfate salts such as Epsom salts or sodium sulfate may be given as first aid for barium poisoning, as they precipitate the barium as the insoluble (and non-toxic) barium sulfate.

Inhalation may also cause irritation to the respiratory tract.

While skin or eye contact is less harmful than ingestion or inhalation, it can still result in irritation, itching, redness, and pain.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set occupational exposure limits at 0.5 mg/m3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average.

<doc id="1112726" wikidata="Q13815" url="?curid=1112726" title="Roda de Ter">
<text>Roda de Ter () is a municipality in the comarca of Osona, province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, near Vic, on the Ter River above the Sau Reservoir. Population: 5,435 (2004), area: 2.18 km2. Its church is dedicated to St. Peter. Main monuments: Pont Vell (&quot;Old Bridge&quot;) and the Capella del Sòl del Pont (Chapel of the floor of the Bridge). The Virgin Mary, &quot;La Mare de Déu del Sòl del Pont&quot; is the patron of the village.

On the site of an Iberian town a Roman villa was established. In its later fortified state it existed until 826, when was destroyed by Aissó, in revolt against the Frankish count Bernat of Septimania. Many years passed before it was repopulated and grew slowly. The fierce independence of the mountain people of northern Catalonia manifested itself in banditry in which villagers were encouraged to participate, even by their silence, by a share in the takings. The bandit leaders might be peasants or local noblemen. On one occasion in 1646, the whole of the village of Roda de Ter was briefly incarcerated as &quot;fautors&quot; (&quot;abettors&quot;) for their part in sheltering members of a local gang.

The Catalan fighters against the French forces of the Bourbon Philip V of Spain are an easily overlooked local part of the European War of the Spanish Succession, but Roda was a hotbed of partisans for the unsuccessful Habsburg claimant. One of them, Francesc Macià i Ambert (died 1713), who came from Roda de Ter, is memorialized in Barcelona by a street and a metro station that bear his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Bac de Roda.

Before the municipality was simply called Roda; it took the name of Roda de Ter in late 20th century when the municipality was split into Roda de Ter (the town) and Masies de Roda (the rural zone). Roda de Ter lies on Catalan route C-153.

The foundry Fundiciones de Roda produced fine cast iron components for hydraulics.

The Catalan poet Miquel Martí i Pol was born in Roda de Ter, March 19, 1929. Children&#x27;s author Miquel Obiols is also from Roda.

It was known as the New Hebrides until the New Hebrides became Republic of Vanuatu in 1980. It finished fourth in the OFC Nations Cup in 1973, 2000, and 2002. In the 2004 Oceania Nations Cup, Vanuatu beat New Zealand 4–2, preventing the regional powerhouse from making the final and, consequently, the running for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Vanuatu caused another shock in the 2007 South Pacific Games by knocking out the Solomon Islands for bronze medal and also enable to enter the second stage of qualification for the OFC Nations Cup and consequently a chance with a playoff for the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa. The last time they had won against Solomon Islands was back in 1998 and had since been on the receiving side of many losses save for one draw against them. In July 2008, Vanuatu faced two national teams from the Solomon Islands during the inaugural edition of the Wantok Cup. Vanuatu lost 1–2 to the Solomons&#x27; team A, but defeated their team B by two goals to one.

In the first match on 9 June 2023, they would face Lebanon but suffered a 3–1 defeat. In the next match, Vanuatu conceded a late goal losing to host India on a narrow 1–0 lost. On 15 June 2023, Vanuatu found themselves with a bright smiles as they would go on to win Mongolia 1–0 thus earning them the 3 points and finishing in third place.

<text>Tiszaújváros (; ) is an industrial town in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county, Northern Hungary, south-east of Miskolc, near the river Tisza.

==History==
Tiszaújváros as a town owes its existence to the industrialization wave that took over the then-socialist Hungary after World War II. The government wanted to speed up industrial development and create new job opportunities in the north-eastern part of the country. 
The town was built up on the outskirts of the old village Tiszaszederkény. In legal terms the old village and the new town are the same: the village became a town in 1966 and was renamed twice, in 1970 and in 1991.

The construction of the town began on 9 September 1955; among the first buildings was a thermal power station and some blocks of flats around it. In the next stage of construction the Tiszai Vegyi Kombinát (TVK, &quot;Chemical Factory&quot;) was built. It is one of the major chemical complexes in Hungary and, according to their website, represents more than 20% of petrochemical capacities in Central Europe. The first production unit, the paint factory started operating in 1961. Newer production units produce chemical fertilizers, polyethylene, and carbon black. An oil refinery was built too.

The factories needed workers, so living quarters were needed in the town. By 1962 several houses were built, mainly using prisoner labor force, and shops and restaurants were opened as well. On 1 June 1961 the council of Tiszaszederkény moved to the new town. The first stage of construction was over. During the second stage (1962–1965) more houses and shops were built. By 1966 there were 1,464 flats for the workers, and on 1 April 1966 the town was officially granted town status. Between 1966 and 1970 – in the 3rd stage of town construction – two primary schools, a secondary school and a community centre were built. The town was now inhabited by 10,000 people.

On 22 April 1970 – the 100th anniversary of Lenin&#x27;s birth – the town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Leninváros&quot; (Lenin Town).

In the 1980s the town developed slower, but steadily. In 1989 the socialist regime ended in Hungary, and in 1991 the town&#x27;s name was changed to Tiszaújváros (literally: &quot;Tisza New Town&quot;, i.e., &#x27;New Town on the Tisza River&#x27;; another Hungarian industrial town, &quot;Sztálinváros&quot; – Stalin Town – similarly changed its name to &quot;Dunaújváros&quot; – &quot;New Town on the Danube&quot; – three decades earlier). During the 1990s the town developed fast, three churches and several new houses were built.

==Sights==
One of the most popular tourist attractions is a thermal bath and water park with chutes.

<doc id="1112733" wikidata="Q1191918" url="?curid=1112733" title="Dry etching">
<text>Dry etching refers to the removal of material, typically a masked pattern of semiconductor material, by exposing the material to a bombardment of ions (usually a plasma of reactive gases such as fluorocarbons, oxygen, chlorine, boron trichloride; sometimes with addition of nitrogen, argon, helium and other gases) that dislodge portions of the material from the exposed surface. A common type of dry etching is reactive-ion etching. Unlike with many (but not all, see isotropic etching) of the wet chemical etchants used in wet etching, the dry etching process typically etches directionally or anisotropically.

==Applications==

Dry etching is used in conjunction with photolithographic techniques to attack certain areas of a semiconductor surface in order to form recesses in material.

Applications include contact holes (which are contacts to the underlying semiconductor substrate), via holes (which are holes that are formed to provide an interconnect path between conductive layers in the layered semiconductor device), transistor gates for FinFET technology, or to otherwise remove portions of semiconductor layers where predominantly vertical sides are desired. Along with semiconductor manufacturing, micromachining and display production, the removal of organic residues by oxygen plasmas is sometimes correctly described as a dry etch process. The term plasma ashing can be used instead.

Dry etching is particularly useful for materials and semiconductors which are chemically resistant and could not be wet etched, such as silicon carbide or gallium nitride.

Low density plasma (LDP) is able to produce high energy reactions at a low energy cost in thanks to its low pressure, meaning dry etch requires a relatively small quantity of chemicals and electricity to function. Additionally, dry etch equipment tends to be an order of magnitude cheaper than photolithography equipment, so many manufacturers rely on dry etching strategies such as pitch doubling or quartering to gain advanced resolutions (14nm+) while needing less advanced photolithography tools. 

==High aspect ratio structures==
Dry etching is currently used in semiconductor fabrication processes due to its unique ability over wet etch to do anisotropic etching (removal of material) to create high aspect ratio structures (e.g. deep holes or capacitor trenches). 

==Hardware design==
The dry etching hardware design basically involves a vacuum chamber, special gas delivery system, radio frequency (RF) waveform generator to supply power to the plasma, heated chuck to seat the wafer, and an exhaust system.

Design varies from manufacturers such as Tokyo Electronic, Applied Materials, and Lam. While all designs follow the same physical principles, the variety of designs target more specialized processing characteristics. For example, dry etch steps that come into contact with or form critical parts of the device may require higher levels of directionality, selectivity, and uniformity. The tradeoff is that more complex dry etch equipment comes at a higher cost to purchase and is more difficult to understand, more expensive to maintain, and may operate more slowly. 

Dry etch equipment can control for process uniformity with several knobs. The chuck temperature can be varied to control the heat of the wafer across the radius of the wafer, which influences the rate of reactions and thus the etch rate across different regions of the wafer. The plasma uniformity can be controlled with plasma confinement, which may be controlled with a high speed magnet rotating around the chamber, variations in gas flow into the chamber and pump out of the chamber, or RF braiding around the chamber. These strategies vary per equipment manufacturer and intended application.

==History==
Dry etching process was invented by Stephen M. Irving who also invented the plasma etching process. The anisotropic dry etching process was developed by Hwa-Nien Yu at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in the early 1970s. It was used by Yu with Robert H. Dennard to fabricate the first micron-scale MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors) in the 1970s.

<doc id="1112736" wikidata="Q2281867" url="?curid=1112736" title="Sidi Moro Sanneh">
<text>Sidi Moro Sanneh (born 2 December 1947) is a Gambian economist, politician and diplomat and is currently a resident of the United States. Sanneh served as the Gambian Minister of Foreign Affairs from October 2004 to March 2005, and as the Gambian Ambassador to Senegal from November 2005 to February 2006.

==Early life and education==

Sanneh was born on 2 December 1947 in Bathurst, the only child of Morro Sanneh, a police inspector, and Aji Mallen Gaye. He was one of the first students to go through Gambia High School, beginning his studies there in 1959.

He attended university in the United States, completing a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics and political science at Wilberforce University, Ohio. He then completed a master&#x27;s degree in agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison before completing a diploma in urban management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, Sanneh campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy in his bid to become the Democratic nominee in the 1968 US presidential election.

==Career==

Sanneh worked as an assistant to the Mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, before working as the city&#x27;s Public Service Employment Administrator and later the Coordinator of the Community Development Block Grant for both the city of Madison and Dane County.

He returned to the Gambia in 1977, following the death of his father, when he joined the Gambian civil service. His first role was in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development (MEPID), working under Dr Jabez Langley. From MEPID, he was seconded for three years to the Ministry of Agriculture to return the scandal-ridden Rural Development Project (RDP) to credibility. Following this, he returned to MEPID before transferring to the Ministry of Education.

At the Ministry of Education he ran a project of investment into the education sector that culminated into what is now the University of the Gambia. In 1989, he was asked to move again, this time to the Ministry of Finance and Trade where he worked as a Deputy Permanent Secretary. In January 1992, he left government service to work as an Executive Director of the African Development Bank Group in Abidjan. He left the Bank in June 2001 when he became a senior advisor on Resource Mobilisation with the United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s (UNDP) Regional Bureau for Africa.

He became the Gambian Minister of Foreign Affairs on 14 October 2004 and served in that position until 24 March 2005, when he was removed without explanation. When relations between the Gambia and Senegal turned sour later that year, Jammeh asked him to return but as the Gambian Ambassador to Senegal. He took this role on in November 2005, with concurrent accreditation for Burkina Faso and Mali, and presented his credentials to the Senegalese government in January 2006. One of the most pressing issues he had to deal with were negotiations over the Casamance conflict.

In early February 2006, Sanneh received a call from a prominent Gambian parliamentarian and Jammeh appointee, warning him that Jammeh suspected him of working with the Gambian opposition. On 16 February, Sanneh received a call notifying that he had been relieved of his duty as an ambassador, but Sanneh insisted on a formal written notification. In March, a Gambian National Intelligence Agency (NIA) agent brought Sanneh the written notification, and informed him that he was to bring him back to Banjul, but Sanneh refused to leave. The Gambian government then granted him permission to remain in the embassy residence until his daughter&#x27;s school year had ended.

Following the end of his daughter&#x27;s school year, Sanneh and his family moved to a hotel in Dakar. At the hotel, Sanneh and his family received threatening anonymous phone calls and noticed a large number of Gambian cars around the hotel and a large number of Gambians working in and staying in the hotel, causing them to fear for their lives. In August 2006, the US Embassy in Dakar requested authorization for Sanneh and his family to be taken in under the US Refugee Resettlement Program, writing that they considered &quot;their lives to be in immediate danger&quot;.

In January 2007, Sanneh returned to the United States, and in January 2008, he was made program Director at Dyncorp International in Falls Church, Virginia. He currently blogs about the Gambian government and is considered a &quot;dissident&quot;.

<doc id="1112746" wikidata="Q848517" url="?curid=1112746" title="Roadside Picnic">
<text>Roadside Picnic (, ) is a philosophical science fiction novel by the Soviet authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky that was written in 1971 and published in 1972. It is their most popular and most widely translated novel outside the former Soviet Union. As of 2003, Boris Strugatsky counted 55 publications of &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot; in 22 countries.

The story is published in English in a translation by Antonina W. Bouis. A preface to the first American edition was written by Theodore Sturgeon. Stanisław Lem wrote an afterword to the German edition of 1977.

Another English translation by Olena Bormashenko was published in 2012, with a foreword by Ursula K. Le Guin and an afterword by Boris Strugatsky.

The book has been the source of many adaptations and other inspired works in a variety of media, including stage plays, video games, and television series. The 1979 film &quot;Stalker&quot;, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, is loosely based on the novel, with a screenplay written by the Strugatsky brothers. Later, in 2007, &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot;, the first installment of a video game franchise taking inspiration from both the book and the film, was released as well.

The term &quot;stalker&quot; (сталкер) became a part of the Russian language and, according to the authors, became the most popular of their neologisms. In the book, stalkers are people who trespass into the forbidden area known as the Zone and steal its valuable extraterrestrial artifacts, which they later sell. In Russian, after Tarkovsky&#x27;s film, the term acquired the meaning of a guide who navigates forbidden or uncharted territories; later on, urbexers and fans of industrial tourism, especially those visiting abandoned sites and ghost towns, were also called stalkers.

==Setting==
&quot;Roadside Picnic&quot; is set in the aftermath of an extraterrestrial event, the Visitation, which occurred simultaneously in several locations around the Earth over a two-day period. Neither the Visitors themselves nor their means of arrival or departure were ever seen by the local populations, who lived inside the relatively small areas, each a few square kilometers, of the six Visitation Zones. The Zones exhibit strange and dangerous phenomena that are not understood by humans and contain artifacts with inexplicable properties. The title of the novel derives from an analogy that is proposed by the character Dr. Valentine Pilman, who compares the Visitation to a picnic:

In this analogy, the nervous animals are the humans who venture forth after the Visitors have left, discovering items and anomalies that are ordinary to those who have discarded them, but incomprehensible or deadly to the earthlings. The explanation implies that the Visitors may not have paid any attention to or even noticed Earth&#x27;s inhabitants during their visit, just as many humans do not notice or pay attention to insects and wildlife during a picnic. The artifacts and phenomena that are left behind by the Visitors in the Zones were garbage, which are discarded and forgotten without any intentions to advance or damage humanity. There is little chance that the Visitors will return again because for them it was a brief stop, for reasons unknown, on the way to their actual destination.

== Plot ==
===Background===
The novel is set in a post-Visitation world in which there are now six zones that are known on Earth to be full of unexplained phenomena with strange happenings having briefly occurred. They are assumed to have been Visitations by aliens. Governments and the United Nations, fearful of unforeseen consequences, try to keep tight control over them to prevent leakage of artifacts from the Zones. A subculture of &quot;stalkers&quot;, scavengers who go into the zones to steal the artifacts for profit, has evolved around the zones. The novel is set in and around a specific zone in Harmont, a fictitious town in an unspecified English-speaking country, and follows the protagonist over the course of eight years.

===Introduction===
The introduction is a live radio interview with Dr. Pilman, who is credited with the discovery that the six Visitation Zones&#x27; locations were not random. He explains it so: &quot;Imagine that you spin a huge globe and you start firing bullets into it. The bullet holes would lie on the surface in a smooth curve. The whole point (is that) all six Visitation Zones are situated on the surface of our planet as though someone had taken shots at Earth from a pistol located somewhere along the Earth–Deneb line. Deneb is the main star in Cygnus.&quot;

===Section 1===
The story revolves around Redrick &quot;Red&quot; Schuhart, a brutal and experienced young stalker who regularly enters the Zone illegally at night in search of valuable artifacts for profit. Trying to clean up his act, he becomes employed as a lab assistant at the International Institute, which studies the Zone. To help the career of his boss, whom he considers a friend, he goes into the Zone with him on an official expedition to recover a unique artifact (a full &quot;empty&quot;), which later leads to his friend&#x27;s death. That comes as a great shock when the news reaches Redrick, who is drunk in a bar, and he blames himself for his friend&#x27;s fate. While Redrick is at the bar, a police force enters looking for stalkers. Redrick is forced to use a &quot;shrieker&quot; to make a hasty getaway. Red&#x27;s girlfriend, Guta, is pregnant and decides to keep the baby no matter what. It is widely rumored that incursions into the Zone by stalkers carry high risk of mutations in their children even though no radiation or other mutagens have been detected in the area. They decide to marry.

===Section 2===
Disillusioned, Redrick returns to stalking. In the course of his joint expedition into the Zone with a fellow stalker, named Burbridge (a.k.a. &quot;The Vulture&quot;), the latter steps into a substance known as &quot;hell slime&quot; (“witches jelly” in the older English translation), which slowly dissolves his leg bones. Amputation must be urgently performed to avoid Burbridge losing his legs entirely. Redrick pulls Burbridge out of the Zone, avoids the patrols, and drops him off at a surgeon. Later, Redrick is confronted by Burbridge&#x27;s daughter, who gets angry with him for saving her father. Guta has given birth to a happy and intelligent daughter, who is fully normal but for having long, light full body hair and black eyes. They lovingly call her the &quot;Monkey,&quot; Redrick meets with his clients in a posh hotel and sells them a fresh portion of the Zone artifacts, but what they are really after is &quot;hell slime&quot;. It is hinted that they want it for military research. Redrick claims not to have it yet and leaves. Shortly afterward, Redrick is arrested but escapes. He then contacts his clients and tells them where he hid the &quot;slime&quot; sample that he had smuggled out. Redrick insists for all proceeds from the sale to be sent to Guta. He realizes that the &quot;slime&quot; will be used for some kind of weapon of mass destruction but decides that he has to provide for his family. He then gives himself up to the police.

===Section 3===
Redrick&#x27;s old friend Richard Noonan, a supply contractor with offices inside the institute, is revealed as a covert operative of an unnamed presumably-governmental, secret organization working to stop the contraband outflow of artifacts from the Zone. Believing that he is nearing the successful completion of his multi-year assignment, he is confronted and scolded by his boss, who reveals to him that the flow is stronger than ever, and he is tasked with finding who is responsible and how they operate. It is revealed that the stalkers are now organized under the cover of the &quot;weekend picnics-for-tourists&quot; business set up by Burbridge. They jokingly refer to the setup as &quot;Sunday school&quot;. Noonan meets with Dr. Valentine Pilman for lunch, and they have an in-depth discussion of the Visitation and humanity in general in which the idea of &quot;Visitation as a roadside picnic&quot; is articulated. Redrick is home again and has served his time. Burbridge visits him regularly and tries to entice him into some secret project, but Redrick declines. Guta is depressed because their daughter has nearly lost her humanity and ability to speak and more and more resembles an actual monkey. Redrick&#x27;s dead father is also present and came home from the cemetery inside the Zone, as other very slow-moving (and completely harmless) reanimated dead are now returning to their homes all around town. They are usually destroyed by the authorities as soon as they are discovered. Redrick, however, had forcibly managed to defend his father from being taken away.

===Section 4===
Redrick goes into the Zone one last time to reach the wish-granting &quot;Golden Sphere&quot;. He has a map that was given to him by Burbridge, whose son, Arthur, joins him on the expedition. Redrick knows one of them has to die in order to temporarily deactivate an invisible phenomenon known as the &quot;meatgrinder&quot; for the other to reach the Sphere, but he keeps that a secret from Arthur, whom he intends to sacrifice to it to make a wish to turn his daughter back to normal. After they get to the location and survive many obstacles, Arthur rushes towards the Sphere and shouts out selfless wishes for a better world, only to be savagely dispatched by the meatgrinder. With the Sphere in front of him, an exhausted Redrick looks back in confusion and bitterness on his whole life of desperate survival in a harsh world, his servitude, and his lack of free will, and he finds that he cannot articulate what he actually wants from the Sphere. After much unaccustomed introspection, Red at first leaves it to the Sphere to look into his untainted soul &quot;to figure out&quot; his wish because &quot;it can&#x27;t be bad&quot; and effectively makes his wish that there is something left in him that would wish for good. In irony, he winds up obsessing in the same way the boy had. &quot;HAPPINESS FOR EVERYBODY, FREE OF CHARGE, AND MAY NO ONE BE LEFT BEHIND!&quot;

==History==
The story was written by the Strugatsky brothers in 1971. The first outlines were written January 18–27 in Leningrad, and the final version was completed between October 28 and November 3 in Komarovo. It was first published in the literary magazine &quot;Avrora&quot; in 1972, issues 7–10. Parts of it (Section 1) were published in Volume 25 of the &quot;Library of Modern Science Fiction&quot; in 1973. A Russian-language version endorsed by the Strugatsky brothers as the original was published in the 1970s.

By 1998, 38 editions of the novel had been published in 20 countries. The novel was first translated into English by Antonina W. Bouis. The preface to the first American edition of the novel (Macmillan, New York, 1977) was written by Theodore Sturgeon.

In 2012, the novel was re-released in English. It was re-translated but also based on a version that was restored by Boris Strugatsky to the original state before the Soviet censors had made their alterations.

==Awards and nominations==
*The novel was nominated for a John W. Campbell Award for best science fiction novel of 1978 and won second place.
*In 1978, the Strugatsky brothers were accepted as honorary members of the Mark Twain Society for their &quot;outstanding contribution to world science fiction literature&quot;.
*A 1979 Scandinavian congress on science fiction literature awarded the Swedish translation the Jules Verne Prize for best novel of the year published in Swedish.

==Adaptations and cultural influence==

* A 1977 Czechoslovak TV miniseries &quot;Návštěva z Vesmíru&quot; (Visit from Space). After its TV premiere, all copies were destroyed by censors.
* A 1979 science fiction film, &quot;Stalker&quot;, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, with a screenplay written by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, is loosely based on the novel. 
* Legendary 80s Argentine post-punk band Don Cornelio y la Zona takes its name from &quot;The Zone&quot;. 
* While not a direct adaptation, the video game series &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; is heavily influenced by &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;. The first game in the series, &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot;, references many important plot points from the book, such as the wish granter and the unknown force blocking the path to the center of the zone. It also contains elements such as anomalies and artifacts that are similar to those described in the book, but that are created by a supernatural ecological disaster, not by alien visitors. 
*The book is referenced in the post-apocalyptic video game &quot;Metro 2033&quot;. A character shuffles through a shelf of books in a ruined library and finds &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;, he states that it is &quot;something familiar&quot;. &quot;Metro 2033&quot; was created by individuals who had worked on &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; before founding their own video game development company. The game was based on a novel of the same name which also took influence from &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;.
* The 1992 video game &quot;Star Control II&quot; references alien visitations with mysterious effects and the &quot;mosquito mange&quot; regarding the disappearance of the Androsynth.
* In 2003, the Finnish theater company Circus Maximus produced a stage version of &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;, called &quot;Stalker&quot;. Authorship of the play was credited to the Strugatskys and to Mikko Viljanen and Mikko Kanninen.
* In the penultimate chapter of &quot;Red Plenty&quot; (2010), Francis Spufford&#x27;s novelized history of Soviet economic ambitions in the 1960s, a character who has been reading &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot; sees it as a metaphor for the effort.
* A tabletop role-playing game in 2012 titled &quot;Stalker&quot; was developed by Ville Vuorela of Burger Games.
* M. John Harrison&#x27;s novel &quot;Nova Swing&quot; (2007), which features a location called the &#x27;Event Zone&#x27; where reality is skewed in various ways, can be seen to be influenced by &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;.
* A Finnish low-budget indie film &quot;Vyöhyke&quot; (&quot;Zone&quot;), directed by Esa Luttinen, was released in 2012. The film is set in a Finnish visitation zone, and refers to material in the novel as well as the Tarkovsky film.
* British progressive rock band Guapo&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;History of the Visitation&quot;, is based on the novel.
* The original Chinese title of the 2015 film &quot;Kaili Blues&quot; by director Bi Gan literally translates to &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;, which is the name of a book of poems written by Chen Sheng, one of the characters in the film. Bi Gan is heavily influenced by Andrei Tarkovsky, especially his film &quot;Stalker&quot;.
* In 2016, the US TV channel WGN America ordered a pilot for a TV adaptation, starring Matthew Goode and directed by Alan Taylor, but did not proceed to a series order.
* The 2016 video game &quot;The Final Station&quot; is partly based on the book, in which an alien &quot;Visitation&quot; occurred across several countries in the game. The Visitation devastated human society but also left some advanced technology to humanity.
* The documentary &quot;HyperNormalisation&quot; by Adam Curtis discusses the book and its role in questioning the realism of Soviet society.
* Japanese writer Iori Miyazawa&#x27;s 2017 &quot;Otherside Picnic&quot; is a Yuri novel, manga and anime series in which two girls explore the &quot;Otherside&quot;, a world of urban legend populated by ghosts of folklore.
* &quot;Annihilation&quot;, a 2018 science fiction psychological horror film, written and directed by Alex Garland, though based on the novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer, for some critics betrays obvious similarities to &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot; and &quot;Stalker&quot;.
* A skirmish wargame published in 2020 titled &quot;Zona Alfa&quot; featuring &quot;skirmish rules for scavenging, exploring, and surviving in a near-future, post-apocalyptic Eastern European setting&quot; in which players can &quot;take on the role of bandits, mercenaries, and military units fighting over the blasted Exclusion Zone and its abandoned artefacts&quot; was developed by Patrick Todoroff for Osprey Publishing.
*A VR game called &quot;Into The Radius&quot; is often compared to the VR equivalent of the &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; series and is heavily influenced by the book.
* The Amazon Prime series &quot;Tales from the Loop&quot;, based on the book of the same title by Simon Stålenhag, is based on a similar premise to &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;. In the series, there are many artefacts and phenomena scattered across the rural area surrounding the fictional town of Mercer, Ohio, which serve as critical plot devices. Abandoned metal spheres exhibiting strange effects lie abandoned in the woods; forest streams become inexplicably frozen or unfrozen, with time-altering effects; inter-dimensional rifts open and close; and an otherworldly, floating sphere, pulsing with seismic energy, is the target of scientific scrutiny. Each of these creates challenges for the characters, who seem at once bemused at, and accepting of, their existence.
* The British-American 2021 science fiction television series &quot;Debris&quot; explores a similar premise.
* The Brazilian-American 2024 video game &quot;Atomic Picnic&quot; draws inspiration from the tale, featuring elements like The Zone and scavenging referred to as Picnic.
* The internet webseries &quot;Parties are for Losers&quot; draws significant inspiration from &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot; in terms of premise.
* The 2024 video game &quot;Pacific Drive&quot; is set in the fictional Olympic Exclusion Zone, a Zone with similar anomalies to the ones in the novel.
* The 2024 video game &quot;Zenless Zone Zero&quot; includes exploring &quot;Zones&quot; with monsters and anomalies reminiscent of the novel.

<doc id="1112749" wikidata="Q2918933" url="?curid=1112749" title="Economy of the State of Palestine">
<text>The economy of the State of Palestine refers to the economic activity of the State of Palestine. Palestine receives substantial financial aid from various international donors, including governments and international organizations. In 2020, the inflation rate of -0.7% and unemployment rate was 25.9%. While exports were recorded at US$1 billion, with an import value of US$6 billion. Contributors to the national economy is service sector (47%), wholesale and repair (19%), manufacturing (12%), agriculture (7%), finance and banking (3%), construction (5%), information technology (5%) and transportation sector (2%).

This aid is crucial for supporting the Palestinian Authority and funding public services and development projects. Palestinians working abroad send money back to their families in Palestine. These remittances provide a significant source of income for many households. Palestinian economy relies heavily on donations and international aid from various sources, including UNRWA, Qatar, Turkey, the European Union, and non-governmental organizations. Contribution to the economy also comes from remittances sent by the Palestinian diaspora. Gazans experience additional difficulties as they are subjected to a siege, with Israel controlling the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza. Nonetheless, there are limited business opportunities available in Gaza. Contrastingly, the West Bank provides Palestinians with more diverse opportunities. Some individuals own businesses in tourism-driven areas such as Bethlehem and Jerusalem, as tourism serves as a significant source of income. Others engage in various types of enterprises in cities like Ramallah and Hebron, ranging from trading to construction and IT services. Furthermore, approximately 100,000 Palestinians find employment in Israeli companies as low-cost labor, earning significantly less than the average Israeli worker.

While trade is restricted due to political factors, Palestine does engage in some export activities. Palestinian products, such as agricultural goods and traditional crafts, are exported to regional and international markets. Despite the challenges, tourism plays a role in the Palestinian economy. The historical and cultural significance of places like Bethlehem and Jerusalem draws tourists. Agriculture remains a crucial sector, with Palestinians cultivating crops, producing olive oil, and raising livestock. Some Palestinians work in various service industries, including education, healthcare, and technology. Palestine hosts numerous international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and humanitarian agencies, which contribute to the local economy and provide employment.

==History==
GDP per capita in the Palestinian territories rose by 7% per year from 1968 to 1980 but slowed during the 1980s. Between 1970 and 1991 life expectancy rose from 56 to 66 years, infant mortality per 1,000 fell from 95 to 42, households with electricity rose from 30% to 85%, households with safe water rose from 15% to 90%, households with a refrigerator rose from 11% to 85%, and households with a washing machine rose from 23% in 1980 to 61% in 1991.

Economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where economic activity was governed by the Paris Economic Protocol of April 1994 between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, deteriorated in the early 1990s. Real per capita GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36.1% between 1992 and 1996 owing to the combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and robust population growth. The downturn in economic activity was due to Israeli closure policies in response to terrorist attacks in Israel, which disrupted previously established labor and commodity market relationships. The most serious effect was the emergence of chronic unemployment. Average unemployment rates in the 1980s were generally under 5%; while by the mid-1990s it had risen to over 20%. After 1997, Israel&#x27;s use of comprehensive closures decreased and new policies were implemented. In October 1999, Israel permitted the opening of a safe passage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in accordance with the 1995 Interim Agreement. These changes in the conduct of economic activity fueled a moderate economic recovery in 1998–99.

As a result of the Israeli blockade, 85% of factories were shut or operated at less than 20% capacity. It is estimated that Israeli businesses lost $2 million a day from the closure while Gaza lost approximately $1 million a day. The World Bank estimated the nominal GDP of the territories at US$4,007,000 and of Israel at US$161,822,000. Per capita these numbers are respectively US$1,036 and US$22,563 per year.

===Prosperity===
During the worldwide recession of the 1930s, Palestine, including its Arab population, suffered severe economic hardships. The global economic downturn had an impact on the region, leading to economic decline and increased unemployment. However, by the end of World War II, Palestine had experienced a significant level of prosperity and was considered one of the most advanced countries in the Middle East in terms of economic development. This prosperity was attributed to several factors. Firstly, during the war, Palestine served as a center of British communications, which brought numerous benefits to the economy. The region benefited from contracts in transport, military construction, and supply, as well as the establishment of a large oil refinery in Haifa. These activities created employment opportunities and stimulated economic growth. Additionally, agricultural exports, particularly citrus fruit, saw a marked increase during this period. The disruption of supplies from other parts of the Mediterranean due to the war, especially the actions of the Germans, created a higher demand for Palestinian citrus products. This presented an opportunity for both Arab and Jewish citrus producers to take advantage of the increased demand and contribute to the economic growth. Although many contracts awarded by the British Mandatory authorities during this period went to the new Jewish immigrants, Arab Palestinians also benefited from the economic opportunities. Arab Palestinians were able to provide cheaper labor, which made them attractive for employment in various sectors. They found employment in the railroads, large military construction projects, and government departments like the police.

During the war, Palestine experienced a period of economic prosperity, which coincided with new forms of investment and trade that connected the region and its entrepreneurs to the global market. The profits generated during this time were invested in various financial instruments such as shares, government bonds, and commodity stocks. After the dispersion of people in 1948, some individuals were able to recover a portion of their wealth through these investments. The passage suggests that data collected by the Mandatory government provides estimates of the wealth held in Palestine during that period. According to the data, the total ownership of capital in the country in 1945 amounted to 281 million Palestinian pounds. Of this total, approximately 47 percent (132.6 million pounds) was owned by the Arab community. The majority of this wealth (74.8 million pounds) was invested in rural landholdings that could not be transferred abroad. However, there were other assets, such as investments in foreign stocks and shares, which were in a form that could be recovered by those who went into exile. These foreign liquid assets amounted to just over 39 million pounds. Additionally, Arab banks in Palestine held 7 million pounds in bank deposits, and another 3 million pounds were deposited in the Ottoman Bank or the local branch of Barclays Bank, some of which was recovered through international litigation in the early 1950s.

A significant portion of the bank deposits held in Arab banks in Palestine, amounting to approximately 10 million pounds, was transferred to Jordan. This transfer occurred as a result of the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948-1949 Arab-Israeli war, with many seeking refuge in Jordan. Furthermore, it mentions that at least 1.5 million pounds in the form of banknotes was brought into the country prior to the abolition of the Palestinian currency. This indicates that individuals who left Palestine took physical banknotes with them as they sought refuge or migrated to other regions. At least 1.5 million pounds in the form of banknotes was transferred to Syria. Smaller amounts being sent to Egypt and Iraq. These transfers suggest that some individuals who left Palestine took physical banknotes with them to these countries.

===Economic rise (1970—2000)===

During the 1970s and subsequent years, a considerable number of Palestinians sought employment opportunities in Israel. This labor integration provided income and remittances, which had positive effects on the Palestinian economy. Palestinian workers played a significant role in various sectors of the Israeli economy, such as construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. While there were some economic benefits from labor integration, the overall economic disparities between Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories persisted. Palestinians faced limited access to resources, markets, and capital, which hindered their economic development.

Integration into the Israeli labor market provided Palestinians with access to job opportunities that were not readily available in the occupied territories. Palestinians found employment in various sectors, including construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and services. This helped alleviate unemployment and provided a source of income for Palestinian workers and their families. The General Federation of Trade Unions, representing Palestinian workers, was founded to advocate for their rights and interests.

Palestinian exports peaked in 1981 followed by a decline through the 1990s. In the same time period imports nearly doubled, increasing a trade deficit of 35% of GDP in 1981 to a deficit of 45% of GDP in 1996. The first Intifada, a Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation, which took place from 1987 to 1993, had a profound impact on the Palestinian economy. The Intifada led to widespread disruptions, closures, and restrictions imposed by Israel, which greatly affected economic activities and livelihoods. In 1991, the invasion of Kuwait and resulting Gulf War affected the Palestinian economy. The Madrid Conference, held that same year, improved economic collaboration between the Arab countries and Israel.

The Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s, led to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and limited self-governance in parts of the West Bank and Gaza. The PA took on responsibilities in areas such as trade, investment, and public services. However, the overall impact on the Palestinian economy was mixed, as the peace process faced setbacks and the Israeli occupation persisted. In 1994, The Paris Protocol was signed, outlining economic relations between Israel and the PA, including provisions for labor movement and employment. Next year, the Israeli government imposed restrictions on the movement of Palestinian workers within Israel due to security concerns. The PA assumed control over some economic sectors, including tourism, trade, and investment by 1995. Until 1999 the Palestinian economy experienced a period of relative growth and stability with increased international aid and improved economic indicators.

For 30 years, Israel permitted thousands of Palestinians to enter the country each day to work in construction, agriculture and other blue-collar jobs. During this period, the Palestinian economy was significantly greater than the majority of Arab states. Until the mid-1990s, up to 150,000 people—about a fifth of the Palestinian labor force—entered Israel each day. After Palestinians unleashed a wave of suicide bombings, the idea of separation from the Palestinians took root in Israel. Israel found itself starved for labor, and gradually replaced most of the Palestinians with migrants from Thailand, Romania and elsewhere.

===Intifada and recovery (2000–present)===
In 2005, the PNA Ministry of Finance cited the Israeli West Bank barrier, whose construction began in the second half of 2002, as one reason for the depressed Palestinian economic activity. Real GDP growth in the West Bank declined substantially in 2000, 2001, and 2002, and increased modestly in 2003 and 2004. The World Bank attributed the modest economic growth since 2003 to &quot;diminished levels of violence, fewer curfews, and more predictable (albeit still intense) closures, as well as adaptation by Palestinian business to the contours of a constrained West Bank economy&quot;. Under a &quot;disengagement scenario&quot; the Bank predicted a real growth rate of −0.2% in 2006 and −0.6% in 2007.

In the wake of Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement from Gaza, there were shortages of bread and basic supplies due to closure of the al Mentar/Karni border-crossing into Israel. Israel&#x27;s offer to open other crossings was turned down by the Hamas-run Palestinian authority.

Following the January 2006 legislative elections, decisively won by Hamas, the Quartet (apart from Russia) cut all funds to the Palestinian Authority led by prime minister Ismail Haniyah (Hamas). The PA had a monthly cash deficit of $60 million-$70 million after it received $50 million – $55 million a month from Israel in taxes and customs duties collected by Israeli officials at the borders. After the elections, the Palestinian stock market fell about 20%, and the PA exhausted its borrowing capacity with local banks. Israel ceased transferring $55 million in tax receipts to the PA. These funds accounted for a third of the PA&#x27;s budget and paid the wages of 160,000 Palestinian civil servants (among them 60,000 security and police officers). The United States and the European Union halted direct aid to the PA, while the US imposed a financial blockade on PA&#x27;s banks, impeding the transfer of some of the Arab League&#x27;s funds (e.g. Saudi Arabia and Qatar). In May 2006, hundreds of Palestinians demonstrated in Gaza and the West Bank demanding payment of their wages. Tension between Hamas and Fatah rose as a result of this &quot;economic squeeze&quot; on the PA.

In 2009, the Israeli military removed its checkpoint at the entrance of Jenin in a series of reductions in security measures.
In September 2012, EU activists stated that the Palestinian economy &quot;lost access to 40% of the West Bank, 82% of its groundwater and more than two-thirds of its grazing land&quot; due to the occupation and settlement construction.

The first planned Palestinian city named Rawabi is under construction north of Ramallah, with the help of funds from Qatar. In 2013, commercial trade between Israel and the Palestinian territories was valued at US$20 billion annually.

==Sectors==

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production of agricultural goods supports the population&#x27;s sustenance needs and fuels Palestine&#x27;s export economy. According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the population. Around 183,000 hectares of land in the Palestinian territories are cultivated, of which around half is used for olive production. Olive products earn more in export income than any other agricultural crop.

Over the past 10 years, unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in Palestine.

Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems, blockades to exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs, widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within the West Bank. Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.

===High tech===
During the 2000s, a high-tech sector emerged in the Palestinian territories, supported by its proximity to Israel, and by 2013, 4,500 Palestinians worked in the IT sector, specializing in software outsourcing (including outsourced work from Israeli companies), telecommunication development and manufacturing equipment. The Palestinian IT sector grew from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 5% in 2010. The industry has seen a 64% increase in foreign business since 2009. The majority of Palestinian IT companies are concerted in the city of Ramallah north of Jerusalem.

Since 2010, Israeli high-tech companies have begun to employ Palestinian engineers. To date, most of them are outsourced workers, but Mellanox, a computer hardware firm, plans to hire 15–20 Palestinian engineers as regular employees. Joint economic cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians officials has experienced growth over the past years. Starting in 2008, Cisco Systems began a concerted effort to jump-start the nascent Palestinian IT sector with a holistic ecosystem approach, encompassing venture capital, private equity, capacity building and direct outsourcing to Palestinian companies. The company invested $15 million toward that end and drew in other major international investors and donors, including Microsoft, HP and Google. The Palestinian IT sector has since grown from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 5% in 2010.

In May 2018, the World Bank published a major report into the Palestinian technology sector entitled, &quot;Tech startup ecosystem in West Bank and Gaza.&quot; According to the report, as of early 2017, there were 241 active tech start-ups in Palestinian Territories, which has created a total of 1,247 jobs. The report also recorded 51 active investors in Palestinian tech companies (around 75 percent angel investors and 25 percent venture capital firms). Among the major VC firms listed are Sadara Ventures, Ibtikar Fund and Oasis500. Venture capital firms reported having invested just under US$150 million in over 40 Palestinian tech companies by 2017. The report also recorded 20 start-up accelerator programs, 19 of which are in the West Bank, and one, Gaza Sky Geeks, in the Gaza Strip. Today Palestine is known as the &quot;Silicon Valley of the NGOs&quot;.

===Traditional industries===

A wide variety of handicrafts, many of which have been produced by Arabs in Palestine for hundreds of years, continue to be produced today. Palestinian handicrafts include embroidery work, pottery-making, soap-making, glass-making, weaving, and olive-wood and Mother of Pearl carvings, among others. Some Palestinian cities in the West Bank, particularly Bethlehem, Hebron and Nablus have gained renown for specializing in the production of a particular handicraft, with the sale and export of such items forming a key part of each city&#x27;s economy.

Stonecutting is a traditional source of income for the Palestinian economy. The annual average output per worker in the stone industry is higher than in any other sector. There are 650 stone production outlets in the West Bank, 138 of them in Beit Fajjar. The quarried material is cut into a rich range of pink, sand, golden, and off-white bricks and tiles known as Jerusalem stone.

===Tourism===
In 2010, 4.6 million people visited the Palestinian territories, compared to 2.6 million in 2009. Of that number, 2.2 million were foreign tourists while 2.7 million were domestic. This number of international visits is misleading, however, since most tourists come for only a few hours or as part of a day trip itinerary. In the last quarter of 2012 over 150,000 guests stayed in West Bank hotels; 40% were European and 9% were from the United States and Canada. Major travel guides write recently that &quot;the West Bank is not the easiest place in which to travel but the effort is richly rewarded.&quot;

The Palestinian Authority and Israeli tourism ministries have attempted to work together on tourism in the Palestinian territories in a Joint Committee. Recent cooperation to share access to foreign tourists has not proven successful in Palestine for many reasons relating to the occupation. Israel controls the movement of tourists into the West Bank. Foreign tourism is presently restricted to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, following the August 2013 indefinite closing of the Rafah crossing located between Egypt and the Hamas controlled Gaza Strip. There is essentially no tourist flow to Gaza since 2005 because of the ongoing Israeli military land, air, and sea blockade.

In 2013 Palestinian Authority Tourism minister Rula Ma&#x27;ay&#x27;a stated that her government aims to encourage international visits to Palestine, but the occupation is the main factor preventing the tourism sector from becoming a major income source to Palestinians. There are no visa conditions imposed on foreign nationals other than those imposed by the visa policy of Israel. Access to Jerusalem and the West Bank is controlled by the Government of Israel and access to Gaza is controlled by Hamas. Entry to the occupied Palestinian territories requires only a valid international passport but entry to Israel may be denied for Palestinians or Arabic visitors. In October 2009, a new project got underway promoting tourism and travel between the two areas. New business efforts and tourist attractions have been initiated in Jenin.

A large number of international brands operates their hotels in the Palestinian territories of both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. These include Intercontinental Jacir Palace, Seven Arches Hotel Intercontinental, Marriott Gaza (later Al-Mashtal) and Millennium Palestine Ramallah Hotel. In 1995, Marriott International proposed to construct a business center-cum-luxury hotel in Gaza. The project was later changed to another hotel, in the same city.

===Oil and gas===

The presence of oil and gas reserves in Palestine has become a contentious issue, with some advocates suggesting that these fossil fuel resources are influencing Israel&#x27;s attacks on the region. According to a 2019 U.N. report, it is estimated that over 3 billion barrels of oil exist off the coast and beneath the occupied lands of Palestine. Additionally, the Levant Basin in the Mediterranean is believed to hold around 1.7 billion barrels of oil, with another 1.5 billion barrels estimated to lie beneath the occupied West Bank area. However, under Israeli occupation, Palestinians are not allowed to drill for oil and gas or develop their independent energy systems, including solar energy. Meanwhile, Israel has been actively claiming these resources for itself, approving licenses for companies to explore for more offshore gas fields. The Israeli government is also interested in building a pipeline to export gas to European nations, particularly as Europe seeks alternative energy providers due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Many advocates argue that foreign interests in extracting these resources from Palestinian lands are contributing to the potential genocide faced by Palestinians. Throughout history, foreign policy in the Middle East has often revolved around fossil fuels, and this situation seems no different. The struggle between Israelis and Palestinians dates back to colonial times, with tensions and conflicts fueled by the desire for community, safety, and control of the land. The discovery of oil in the region further complicated the situation, as world powers sought to secure access to this crucial commodity. The intertwined history of oil and the creation of modern Middle Eastern states makes it difficult to separate conflicts in the region from the influence of oil and gas resources. The presence of billions of barrels of oil in Palestine, combined with the geopolitical interests of various actors, adds another layer of complexity to the Israel–Palestine conflict. When it comes to the presence of oil and gas reserves in Palestine, there is an ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine over the ownership and exploitation of these resources. In 1999, a gas field was discovered about 20 miles off the coast of Gaza. However, negotiations between Israel and Palestine to divide these resources were disrupted by the second intifada, or Palestinian uprisings, which began in 2000.

Under international law, the oil and gas resources in Palestine should belong to the occupied territory and not the occupying power (Israel). However, Israel has been benefiting from the oil and gas reserves beneath Palestinian lands and waters. Palestine has been unable to access these resources, resulting in a loss of billions of dollars of economic potential. Moreover, there are concerns about the environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction, and Palestinian activists are pushing for a focus on renewable energy instead. The international community&#x27;s complicity in the ongoing Israeli occupation and the conflict in Gaza is seen by some as intricately tied to capitalist interests and the pursuit of profit. The history of colonialism and the extraction of oil resources in the Middle East is seen as part of the wider context of the Israel-Palestine conflict. While some argue that fossil fuels have a marginal role in the conflict, others believe that religious ideology, geopolitical strategies, and access to trading routes play a bigger role. Overall, the conflict in Palestine and the pursuit of oil and gas resources have deep historical and geopolitical roots that contribute to the ongoing tensions in the region.

Palestine holds massive potential reserves of oil and gas. Over of oil are estimated to exist off the coast and beneath occupied Palestinian lands. The Levant Basin holds around of oil, with another barrels beneath the occupied West Bank area. Around of oil reserves are believed to exist in shore of the Gaza Strip. According to a report by the UNCTAD, around of oil reserves are in the occupied Palestinian territory of the West Bank, probably the Meged oil field. As per the Palestinian Authority, 80% of this oil field falls under the lands owned by Palestinians.

Masadder, a subsidiary of the Palestine Investment Fund is developing the oilfield in the West Bank. Block-1 field, which spans an area of from northwest Ramallah to Qalqilya in Palestine, has significant potential for recoverable hydrocarbon resources. It is estimated to have a P90 (a level of certainty) of of recoverable oil and . The estimated cost for the development of the field is $390 million, and it will be carried out under a production sharing agreement with the Government of Palestine. Currently, an initial pre-exploration work program is underway to prepare for designing an exploration plan for approval, which will precede the full-fledged development of the field.

Natural gas in Palestine is mostly found in Gaza Strip. Gaza Marine is a natural gas field, located around from the coast of the territory in the Mediterranean shore. It holds gas reserves ranging between to . These estimates far exceed the needs of the Palestinian territories in energy. The gas field was discovered by the British Gas Group in 1999. Upon the discovery of the gas field, it was lauded by Yasser Arafat as a &quot;Gift from God&quot;. A regional cooperation between the Palestinian Authority, Israel and Egypt were signed for developing the field and Hamas also gave approval to the Palestinian Authority. However, since the ongoing war in Gaza, this project have been delayed.

==Infrastructure==

===Communications===

The World Bank estimated in 2016 that restrictive measures placed by Israel on telecommunication operators in the West Bank have had a notable negative impact on the development of the Palestinian telecommunications networks, which is sustaining losses in the range of $1 billion. These restrictive measures include the denial to operate in 60% of the West Bank under Israeli military administration (Area C), limitations on the importation of technology for ICT companies, requiring Palestinian operators to access international links via a company with Israeli registration, delaying in the provision of mobile broadband, the failure to set in place an independent regulator for the sector in the territories, and Israeli operators who lack appropriate authorizations who continue to operate in the Palestinian market.

==By sub-region==

===West Bank===
In 2007, the economy in the West Bank improved gradually. Economic growth reached about 4–5% and unemployment dropped about 3%. Israeli figures indicated that wages in the West Bank rose more than 20% in 2008 and trade rose about 35%. Tourism in Bethlehem increased to about twice its previous levels, and tourism increased by 50% in Jericho. Life expectancy is 73.4, placing the territories 77th in the world, compared with a life expectancy of 72.5 in Jordan, 71.8 in Turkey, and 80.7 in Israel. Car sales in 2008 were double those of 2007. The International Monetary Fund report for the West Bank forecast a 7% growth rate for 2009.

The Bethlehem Small Enterprise Center opened in early 2008. Funded by Germany, the center has helped to promote computer literacy and marketing skills.
In 2009, efforts continued to build Palestinian local institutions and governments from the ground up. Much of this work was done by Tony Blair and US General Keith Dayton. Some analysts saw this as a more substantial way to lay a groundwork for viable institutions and for local peace. In August 2009, a state of the art web-based system for tracking goods coming in and out of the area by Palestinian customs was launched in partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

In 2009, an economic &quot;boom&quot; began with growth reaching 8 percent, higher than in Israel or the West. However, with inflation around 9.9% that same year, real economic growth is actually negative insofar as purchasing power has decreased. Tourism to Bethlehem, which had doubled to 1 million in 2008, rose to nearly 1.5 million in 2009. New car imports increased by 44 percent. New shopping malls opened in Jenin and Nablus. As an outcome of the Palestine Investment Conference, Palestinian developers are planning to build the first modern Palestinian city, Rawabi.

In 2010, Ramallah was described as a hub of the economic activity thanks to improved security within the city, successful battle against corruption and large consumer base.

In 2011, the Palestinian Planning Minister said that GDP growth was expected to reach 9%, rising to 10% in 2012 and 12% in 2013.

===East Jerusalem===
East Jerusalem was once the business and shopping hub of the West Bank. However, since the advent of Israeli security checkpoints and the separation barrier starting over a decade ago, it has become isolated from its customer base leading to serious economic decline. According to Hanna Siniora of the Palestinian-American Chamber of Commerce, the turning point was 1993. He states that since then East Jerusalem has become a closed city through isolation from the rest of the West Bank causing a loss of 50% of its business between 1993 and 2001.

According to a 2012 report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and interviews conducted by the Forward, the decline of the economy in East Jerusalem has led to unprecedented levels of poverty, with 80% of the Palestinian population living below the poverty line. The main cause is seen as the political and physical barriers separating it from the rest of the West Bank. The ACRI report attributing the problem to &quot;&#x27;the cumulative effects of annexation, neglect, rights violations and the completion of the separation barrier.&quot; Another contributing factor to the economic decline is the housing situation. The Israeli government has facilitated extensive construction for Israeli settler neighborhoods, but has severely restricted development and building for the Palestinian population.

===Gaza Strip===
According to CIA&#x27;s &quot;The World Factbook&quot;, Israel&#x27;s closure policy, which was extended when the Hamas administration came to power in 2007, was responsible for high levels of poverty and unemployment and a significant decline of the private sector which was heavily reliant upon export markets. Israel blamed Hamas for taking actions that led to the closure policy. A large part of the population is dependent on humanitarian assistance, primarily from the UN agencies.

An easing of Israel&#x27;s closure policy in 2010 resulted in an improvement in some economic indicators, but regular exports from the Gaza Strip were still prohibited. According to the Israeli Defense Forces, the economy improved in 2011, with a drop in unemployment and an increase in GDP. New malls have opened, local industry is developing and the economic upswing has led to the construction of hotels and a rise in the import of cars. Wide-scale development has been made possible by the unhindered movement of goods into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and tunnels between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The current rate of trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom is 250 trucks per day. This figure fluctuates depending on the level of interference with goods being brought into Gaza from Egypt through tunnels. The increase in building activity has led to a shortage of construction workers. To make up for the deficit, young people are being sent to learn the trade in Turkey.

==Currency==

Under the Protocol on Economic Relations, the Palestinians are not allowed to independently introduce a separate Palestinian currency. Instead, the Israeli new shekel is the main currency of the Palestinian territories. In the West Bank the Jordanian dinar is also used. The shekel is used for most transactions, especially retail, while the dinar is used more for savings and durable goods transactions. The United States dollar is also sometimes used for savings and for purchasing foreign goods. The dollar is used by the overwhelming majority of transactions overseen by the Palestinian Monetary Authority (that functions as Palestine&#x27;s central bank), which only represent a fraction of the transactions conducted in Palestine or by Palestinians.

In the Gaza Strip, the shekel is also the main currency, though it is in short supply due to the blockade of the Gaza Strip by the PA, Israel and Egypt.

Because the Palestinian Monetary Authority does not issue its own currency, it is therefore unable to pursue an independent and effective monetary policy. At the same time, the use of multiple currencies increases the costs and creates inconvenience arising from fluctuating exchange rates.

==Taxation==
Taxation in the Palestinian territories is a complex system which may involve payment to the Palestinian Authority (PA) and/or Israel. In 2005, the PA collected approximately $34 million per month from taxes and other charges, while Israel collected about $75 million per month in tariffs on foreign imports and value added taxes (VAT) on Israeli goods and services and on average retained about $15 million for the payment of water and power bills of Palestinians, while forwarding the other $60 million to the PA. Israeli collected funds account for about two-thirds of the PA&#x27;s self-generated revenue, which Reuters put at $100 million in December 2012. Since the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and the formation of a Hamas government in the PA, Israel has regularly withheld the taxes it owes the PA.

==Employment==
According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the population. Over the past 10 years, unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in Palestine. Unemployment rates peaked in 2008 when they reached 41% in Gaza.

===By Israelis===
High unemployment in the Palestinian economy led about 100,000 Palestinians to work in Israel. By March 2014, about 45,000 permits were issued for work in Israel with further 25,000 issued for work in West Bank settlements. It is estimated 35,000 Palestinian work through illegal channels and without a permit. Recently the quota for permits has increased and minimum age for obtaining one was reduced from 26 to 24. Sectors in which Palestinians are employed include construction, manufacturing, commerce and agriculture.

As of 2013, average daily wages in Israel and the settlements is nearly 2.2 times higher than in the private sector in the West Bank and over 4 times that in Gaza. As of 2022, Palestinian monthly minimum wage is ₪1,450, almost a quarter of the Israeli minimum wage of ₪5,300. In the West Bank, Israeli labour laws are partially applied through military enactments, and a ruling of the Supreme Court of Israel of 2007 apply the law for work done inside Israeli settlements. Yet, there have been incidents where Israeli employers did not fulfill their legal obligations to the employees by refusing to provide a paycheck or hide the number of work hours to avoid labour laws such as minimum wage or social security benefits.

In 2014, an article published on Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s official daily, praised Israeli treatment of Palestinian workers. With having added benefits such as transportation, medical and pensions, Palestinians are quick to leave their Palestinian employers and work for Israelis, whenever they have the opportunity to do so. Safety rules are enforced strictly by Israeli Workers&#x27; Union and physical examinations are done by doctors. The PA has passed labour laws but do not enforce rules such as the minimum wage, annual vacations, sick leave or extra payments for overtime work.

==Foreign aid==

In 2008, the West Bank and Gaza economies were heavily reliant on foreign aid which stood at 1.8 billion. Approximately 30% of the GDP, or US$487 per Palestinian per year came from aid. Foreign aid provided essential services for nearly half of the Palestinian people, and allowed the Palestinian Authority to operate and pay its estimated 140,000 employees.

In 2010, Arab states cut financial aid to the Palestinian Authority. According to the Palestinian Finance Ministry, the PA received $583.5 million in budget support by August 2010, of which only 22 percent came from Arab states. The remainder was from international donors, including the European Union and the United States. Salah Rafat, a member of the PLO Executive Committee, urged the Arab countries to honor their financial pledges.

In April 2011, Salam Fayyad met with Western donors in Brussels and requested $5 billion in aid.

As part of a 2013 effort to inspire peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, US Secretary of State John Kerry proposed a $4 billion plan of private investment in the Palestinian economy. The plan was described as having the potential to significantly grow the economy of the West Bank, but no specifics were provided as to what projects were envisioned, who would invest the money, or what modifications might be required in Israel&#x27;s restrictions on the West Bank for the plan to work. The proposal was coordinated in association with the Quartet, a Middle East peacemaking group comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations, for which former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair served as an envoy. The Palestinian Authority responded by indicating that it would not trade its political aspirations for economic aid, but was assured that the plan was meant as a complement to negotiations, and not as a substitute. Peace talks failed for unrelated reasons without any implementation of the proposal.

According to Jonathan Cook in an article published by &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, Israeli economist Shir Hever has estimated (2016) that at a minimum 78% of foreign humanitarian aid to Palestine finishes up in Israeli coffers. He draws the implication that foreign donor countries are thereby financing Israel&#x27;s occupation. In return Palestinians receive the equivalent amount in food, goods and services from Israel which is used to improve the standard of living of Palestinians.

==Israeli–Palestinian relations==
===Commerce===

Olives of Peace is a joint Israeli–Palestinian business venture to sell olive oil. Through this project, Israelis and Palestinians have carried out joint training sessions and planning. The oil is sold under the brand name &quot;Olives of Peace.&quot;

 The two regions are planning a joint industrial zone which would bridge the border. Palestinians would produce locally-made handicrafts and sell them through Gilboa to other regions of the world. Another possible project is a joint language center, where Israelis and Palestinians would teach each other Arabic and Hebrew, as well as aspects of their cultural heritage.

In 2011, bilateral trade between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled areas reached $4.3 billion, with Israeli exports to the PA amounting to $3.5 billion and Palestinian exports to Israel amounting to $816 million. According to Nader Tamimi, chair of the Association of Traditional Industries in the PA, there are regular interactions between Palestinian and Israeli businessmen.

At a conference hosted by the Faculty of Business and Management at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 2012, Israeli and Palestinian trade experts met to discuss ways of promoting cross-border business interactions.

In 2013, commercial trade between Israel and the Palestinian Authority were valued at US$20 billion annually. The continuously increasing transactions led to the creation of the joint Palestinian and Israeli initiative, the Jerusalem Arbitration Center (JAC). The center will specialize as an independent institution focusing on business arbitration between Israelis and Palestinians.

Due to the clearance crisis with Israel, the Palestinian economy was severely hit in terms of public finances, according to the World Bank&#x27;s report in 2019. World Bank Acting Country Director for West Bank Gaza Anna Bjerde said, &quot;The economy, which in 2018 saw no real growth, is now facing a severe fiscal shock because of the standoff over clearance revenue transfers.&quot; The report states, &quot;Against a background of declining aid flows, the recent standoff stemmed from Israel’s unilateral deduction of US$138 million from the PA’s clearance revenues in 2019 to offset estimated payouts to Palestinian martyrs and prisoners&#x27; families.&quot;

===Conflict===
In 2006, the unity of the Palestinian economy was fractured following Fatah-Hamas split prompting Israel to sever direct ties between the West Bank and Gaza. The following war in 2008–2009 destroyed most of the economic infrastructure of the Gaza Strip and left the Palestinian economy without any remaining activity and $1.4 billion in debt. The Oslo Accords in 1993 aimed to prevent this, but was unable to keep the Palestinian economy from fluctuating. Currently, the Palestinian economy lives on foreign aid and customs revenue between Israel and Palestine. However, Israeli restrictions continue to hamper and fragment the Palestinian economy. By 2008, 71% of the Gaza Strip&#x27;s population was unemployed. The import and export prosperity in Palestine was impacted by the border restrictions and constant Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza, which also weakened the industrial and agricultural sectors. In order for the Palestinian economy to prosper, the restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed. In the West Bank, the Israeli restrictions caused the Palestinian economy to lose $3.4bn (35% of the annual GDP), according to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and a World Bank report.

<text>David Michael Kennedy (born July 22, 1941) is an American historian specializing in American history. He is the Donald J. McLachlan Professor of History Emeritus at Stanford University and the former director of the Bill Lane Center for the American West. Kennedy&#x27;s scholarship is notable for its integration of economic analysis and cultural analysis with social history and political history.

Kennedy is responsible for the recent editions of the popular history textbook, &quot;The American Pageant&quot;. He is also the current editor (since 1999) of the &quot;Oxford History of the United States&quot; series. This position was held previously by C. Vann Woodward. Earlier in his career, Kennedy won the Bancroft Prize for his first book &quot;Birth Control in America: The Career of Margaret Sanger&quot; (1970), and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for his book &quot;World War I, Over Here: The First World War and American Society&quot; (1980). He was the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History from 1995 to 1996. He won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for History for &quot;Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929–1945&quot; (1999).

==Biography==
Born on July 22, 1941, in Seattle, Washington, Kennedy received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Stanford University and his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in American studies from Yale University. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>A retirement plan is a financial arrangement designed to replace employment income upon retirement. These plans may be set up by employers, insurance companies, trade unions, the government, or other institutions. Congress has expressed a desire to encourage responsible retirement planning by granting favorable tax treatment to a wide variety of plans. Federal tax aspects of retirement plans in the United States are based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the plans are regulated by the Department of Labor under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

==Types of retirement plans==
Retirement plans are classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans, depending on how benefits are determined.

In a defined benefit (or pension) plan, benefits are calculated using a fixed formula that typically factors in final pay and service with an employer, and payments are made from a trust fund specifically dedicated to the plan. Separate accounts for each participant do not exist.

By contrast, in a defined contribution plan, each participant has an account, and the benefit for the participant is dependent upon both the amount of money contributed into the account and the performance of the investments purchased with the funds contributed to the account.

Some types of retirement plans, such as cash balance plans, combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.

===Defined contribution plans===

According to Internal Revenue Code Section 414, a defined contribution plan is an employer-sponsored plan with an individual account for each participant. The accrued benefit from such a plan is solely attributable to contributions made into an individual account and investment gains on those funds, less any losses and expense charges. The contributions are invested (&quot;e.g.&quot;, in the stock market), and the returns on the investment are credited to or deducted from the individual&#x27;s account. Upon retirement, the participant&#x27;s account is used to provide retirement benefits, often through the purchase of an annuity. Defined contribution plans have become more widespread over recent years and are now the dominant form of plan in the private sector. The number of defined benefit plans in the U.S. has been steadily declining, as more employers see pension funding as a financial risk they can avoid by freezing the plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan.

Examples of defined contribution plans include individual retirement account (IRA), 401(k), and profit sharing plans. In such plans, the participant is responsible for selecting the types of investments toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated. This may range from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined mutual funds to selecting individual stocks or other investments (such as bonds). Most self-directed retirement plans are characterized by certain tax advantages. The funds in such plans may not be withdrawn without penalty until the investor reaches retirement age, which is typically the year in which taxpayer reaches 59.5 years of age.

Money contributed can be from employee salary deferrals, employer contributions, or employer matching contributions. Defined contribution plans are subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 415 limits on how much can be contributed. As of 2015, the total deferral amount including the employee and employer contribution is capped at $53,000. The employee-only amount is $18,000 for 2015, but a plan can permit participants who are age 50 or older to make &quot;catch-up&quot; contributions of up to an additional $6,000.

===Defined benefit plans===

Commonly referred to as a pension in the US, a defined benefit plan pays benefits from a trust fund using a specific formula set forth by the plan sponsor. In other words, the plan &quot;defines a benefit&quot; that will be paid upon retirement. The statutory definition of &quot;defined benefit&quot; encompasses all pension plans that are not defined contribution and therefore do not have individual accounts.

While this catch-all definition has been interpreted by the courts to capture some hybrid pension plans like cash balance (CB) plans and pension equity plans (PEP), most pension plans offered by large businesses or government agencies are &quot;final average pay&quot; (FAP) plans, under which the monthly benefit is equal to the number of years worked multiplied by the member&#x27;s salary at retirement multiplied by a factor known as the &quot;accrual rate&quot;. At a minimum, benefits are payable in &quot;normal form&quot; as a Single Life Annuity (SLA) for single participants or as a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA) for married participants. Both normal forms are paid at Normal Retirement Age (usually 65) and may be actuarially adjusted for early or late commencement. Other optional forms of payment, such as lump sum distributions, may be available but are not required.

The cash balance plan typically offers a lump sum at and often before normal retirement age. However, as is the case with all defined benefit plans, a cash balance plan must also provide the option of receiving the benefit as a life annuity. The amount of the annuity benefit must be &quot;definitely determinable&quot; as per IRS regulation 1.412-1.

Defined benefit plans may be either &quot;funded&quot; or &quot;unfunded&quot;. In a funded plan, contributions from the employer and participants are invested into a trust fund dedicated solely to paying benefits to retirees under a given plan. The future returns on the investments and the future benefits to be paid are not known in advance, so there is no guarantee that a given level of contributions will meet future obligations. Therefore, fund assets and liabilities are regularly reviewed by an actuary in a process known as valuation. A defined benefit plan is required to maintain adequate funding if it is to remain qualified.

In an unfunded plan, no funds are set aside for the specific purpose of paying benefits. The benefits to be paid are met immediately by contributions to the plan or by general assets. Most government-run retirement plans, including Social Security, are unfunded, with benefits being paid directly out of current taxes and Social Security contributions. Most nonqualified plans are also unfunded.

===Hybrid and cash balance plans===
Hybrid plan designs combine the features of defined benefit and defined contribution plan designs. In general, they are treated as defined benefit plans for tax, accounting, and regulatory purposes. As with defined benefit plans, investment risk is largely borne by the plan sponsor. As with defined contribution designs, plan benefits are expressed in the terms of a notional &quot;account balance&quot;, and are usually paid as cash balances upon termination of employment. These features make them more portable than traditional defined benefit plans and perhaps more attractive to a highly mobile workforce. A typical hybrid design is the cash balance plan, where the employee&#x27;s notional account balance grows by some defined rate of interest and annual employer contribution.

In the United States, conversions from traditional plan to hybrid plan designs have been controversial. Upon conversion, plan sponsors are required to retrospectively calculate employee account balances, and if the employee&#x27;s actual vested benefit under the old design is more than the account balance, the employee enters a period of &quot;wear away&quot;. During this period, the employee would be eligible to receive the already accrued benefit under the old formula, but all future benefits are accrued under the new plan design. Eventually, the accrued benefit under the new design exceeds the grandfathered amount under the old design. To the participant, however, it appears as if there is a period where no new benefits are accrued. Hybrid designs also typically eliminate the more generous early retirement provisions of traditional pensions.

Because younger workers have more years in which to accrue interest and pay credits than those approaching retirement age, critics of cash balance plans have called the new designs discriminatory. On the other hand, the new designs may better meet the needs of a modern workforce and actually encourage older workers to remain at work, since benefit accruals continue at a constant pace as long as an employee remains on the job. As of 2008, the courts have generally rejected the notion that cash balance plans discriminate based on age, while the Pension Protection Act of 2006 offers relief for most hybrid plans on a prospective basis.

Although a cash balance plan is technically a defined benefit plan designed to allow workers to evaluate the economic worth their pension benefit in the manner of a defined contribution plan (&quot;i.e.&quot;, as an account balance), the &quot;target benefit&quot; plan is a defined contribution plan designed to express its projected impact in terms of lifetime income as a percent of final salary at retirement (&quot;i.e.,&quot; as an annuity amount). For example, a target benefit plan may mimic a typical defined benefit plan offering 1.5% of salary per year of service times the final 3-year average salary. Actuarial assumptions like 5% interest, 3% salary increases and the UP84 Life Table for mortality are used to calculate a level contribution rate that would create the needed lump sum at retirement age. The problem with such plans is that the flat rate could be low for young entrants and high for old entrants. While this may appear unfair, the skewing of benefits to the old worker is a feature of most traditional defined benefit plans, and any attempt to match it would reveal this backloading feature.

===Requirement of permanence===
To guard against tax abuse in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has promulgated rules that require that pension plans be permanent as opposed to a temporary arrangement used to capture tax benefits. Regulation 1.401-1(b)(2) states that &quot;[t]hus, although the employer may reserve the right to change or terminate the plan, and to discontinue contributions thereunder, the abandonment of the plan for any reason other than business necessity within a few years after it has taken effect will be evidence that the plan from its inception was not a bona fide program for the exclusive benefit of employees in general. Especially will this be true if, for example, a pension plan is abandoned soon after pensions have been fully funded for persons in favor of whom discrimination is prohibited...&quot; The IRS would have grounds to disqualify the plan retroactively, even if the plan sponsor initially got a favorable determination letter.

===Qualified retirement plans===
Qualified plans receive favorable tax treatment and are regulated by ERISA. The technical definition of &quot;qualified&quot; does not agree with the commonly used distinction. For example, 403(b) plans are not considered qualified plans, but are treated and taxed almost identically.

The term &quot;qualified&quot; has special meaning regarding defined benefit plans. The IRS defines strict requirements a plan must meet in order to receive favorable tax treatment, including:
* A plan must offer life annuities in the form of a Single Life Annuity (SLA) and a Qualified Joint &amp; Survivor Annuity (QJSA).
* A plan must maintain sufficient funding levels.
* A plan must be administered according to the plan document.
* Benefits are required to commence at retirement age (usually age 65 if no longer working, or age 70 1/2 if still employed).
* Once earned, benefits may not be forfeited.
* A plan may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.
* A plan must be insured by the PBGC.
Failure to meet IRS requirements can lead to plan disqualification, which carries with it enormous tax consequences.

===SIMPLE IRAs===
A SIMPLE IRA is a type of Individual Retirement Account (IRA) that is provided by an employer. It is similar to a 401(k) but offers simpler and less costly administration rules. Like a 401(k) plan, the SIMPLE IRA is funded by a pre-tax salary reduction. However, contribution limits for SIMPLE plans are lower than for most other types of employer-provided retirement plans.

===SEP IRAs===
A Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Account, or SEP IRA, is a variation of the Individual Retirement Account. SEP IRAs are adopted by business owners to provide retirement benefits for the business owners and their employees. There are no significant administration costs for self-employed person with no employees. If the self-employed person does have employees, all employees must receive the same benefits under a SEP plan. Because SEP accounts are treated as IRAs, funds can be invested the same way as is the case for any other IRA.

===Keogh or HR10 plans===
Keogh plans are full-fledged pension plans for the self-employed. Named for U.S. Representative Eugene James Keogh of New York, they are sometimes called HR10 plans.

===Nonqualified plans===
Plans that do not meet the guidelines required to receive favorable tax treatment are considered &quot;nonqualified&quot; and are exempt from the restrictions placed on qualified plans. They are typically used to provide additional benefits to key or highly paid employees, such as executives and officers. Examples include SERP (Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans) and 457(f) plans.

==Contrasting types of retirement plans==
Advocates of Defined contribution plan point out that each employee has the ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and financial situation, including the choice of how much to contribute, if anything at all. However, others state that these apparent advantages could also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily contribute money to retirement accounts.

==Portability and valuation==
Defined contribution plans have actual balances of which workers can know the value with certainty by simply checking the record of the balance. There is no legal requirement that the employer allow the former worker take his money out to roll over into an IRA, though it is relatively uncommon in the U.S. not to allow this (and many companies such as Fidelity run numerous TV ads encouraging individuals to transfer their old plans into current ones).

Because the lump sum actuarial present value of a former worker&#x27;s vested accrued benefit is uncertain, the IRS, under section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, specifies the interest and mortality figures that must be used. This has caused some employers as in the Berger versus Xerox case in the 7th Circuit (Richard A. Posner was the judge who wrote the opinion) with cash balance plans to have a higher liability for employers for a lump sum than was in the employee&#x27;s &quot;notional&quot; or &quot;hypothetical&quot; account balance.

When the interest credit rate exceeds the mandated section 417(e) discounting rate, the legally mandated lump sum value payable to the employee [if the plan sponsor allows for pre-retirement lump sums] would exceed the notional balance in the employee&#x27;s cash balance account. This has been colourfully dubbed the &quot;Whipsaw&quot; in actuarial parlance. The Pension Protection Act signed into law on August 17, 2006 contained added provisions for these types of plans allowing the distribution of the cash balance account as a lump sum.

===Portability: practical difference, not a legal difference===
A practical difference is that a defined contribution plan&#x27;s assets generally remain with the employee (generally, amounts contributed by the employee and earnings on them remain with the employee, but employer contributions and earnings on them do not vest with the employee until a specified period has elapsed), even if he or she transfers to a new job or decides to retire early. By contrast, in many countries defined benefit pension benefits are typically lost if the worker fails to serve the requisite number of years with the same company. Self-directed accounts from one employer may usually be &#x27;rolled-over&#x27; to another employer&#x27;s account or converted from one type of account to another in these cases.

Because defined contribution plans have actual balances, employers can simply write a check because the amount of their liability at termination of employment which may be decades before actual normal (65) retirement date of the plan is known with certainty. There is no legal requirement that the employer allow the former worker take his money out to roll over into an IRA, though it is relatively uncommon in the US not to allow this.

Just as there is no legal requirement to give &quot;portability&quot; to a Defined contribution plan, there is no mandated ban on portability for defined benefit plans. However, because the lump sum actuarial present value of a former worker&#x27;s vested accrued benefit is uncertain, the mandate under in section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code specifies the interest and mortality figures that must be used. This uncertainty has limited the practical portability of defined benefit plans.

===Investment risk borne by employee or employer===
It is commonly said that the employee bears investment risk for defined contribution plans, while the employer bears that risk in defined benefit plans. This is true for practically all cases, but pension law in the United States does not require that employees bear investment risk. The law only provides a section 404(c) exemption under ERISA from fiduciary liability if the employer provides the mandated investment choices and gives employees sufficient control to customize his pension investment portfolio appropriate to his risk tolerance.

===PBGC insurance: a legal difference===
ERISA does not provide insurance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) for defined contribution plans, but cash balance plans do get such insurance because they, like all ERISA-defined benefit plans, are covered by the PBGC.

Plans may also be either employer-provided or individual plans. Most types of retirement plans are employer-provided, though individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are very common.

==Tax advantages==
Most retirement plans (the exception being most non qualified plans) offer significant tax advantages. Most commonly the money contributed to the account is not taxed as income to the employee at the time of the contribution. In the case of employer provided plans, however, the employer is able to receive a tax deduction for the amount contributed as if it were regular employee compensation. This is known as &quot;pre-tax&quot; contributions, and the amounts allowed to be contributed vary significantly among various plan types. The other significant advantage is that the assets in the plan are allowed to grow through investing without the taxpayer being taxed on the annual growth year by year. Once the money is withdrawn it is taxed fully as income for the year of the withdrawal. There are many restrictions on contributions, especially with 401(k) and defined benefit plans. The restrictions are designed to make sure that highly compensated employees do not gain too much tax advantage at the expense of lesser paid employees.

Currently two types of plan, the Roth IRA and the Roth 401(k), offer tax advantages that are essentially reversed from most retirement plans. Contributions to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s must be made with money that has been taxed as income. After meeting the various restrictions, withdrawals from the account are received by the taxpayer tax-free.

===EGTRRA and later changes===
The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) brought significant changes to retirement plans, generally easing restrictions on the ability of the taxpayer to roll money from one type of account to the other, and increasing contributions limits. Most of the changes were designed to phase in over a period of 4 to 10 years.

==History of pensions in the United States==
*1717: The Presbyterian Church creates a Fund for Pious Uses to provide for retired ministers.
* 1884: Baltimore and Ohio Railroad establishes the first pension plan by a major employer, allowing workers at age 65 who had worked for the railroad for at least 10 years to retire and receive benefits ranging from 20 to 35% of wages.
* 1889: The American Express Company creates the first pension plan in the United States. 
* The Revenue Act of 1913, passed following the passage of the 16th amendment to the constitution which permitted income taxation, recognized the tax exempt nature of pension trusts. At the time, several large pension trusts were already in existence- including the pension trust for ministers of the Anglican Church in the United States.
*1920: Civil Service Retirement System
*1924: The Presbyterian Church, USA, creates its current pension program
* 1940s: General Motors chairman Charles Erwin Wilson designed GM&#x27;s first modern pension fund. He said that it should invest in all stocks, not just GM.
* 1963: Studebaker terminated its underfunded pension plan, leaving employees with no legal recourse for their pension promises.
* 1974: ERISA – imposed reporting and disclosure obligations and minimum standards for participation, vesting, accrual and funding on U.S. plan sponsors, established fiduciary standards applicable to plan administrators and asset managers, established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to ensure benefits for participants in terminated defined benefit plans, updated the Internal Revenue Code rules for tax qualification, and authorized Employee Stock Ownership Plans (&quot;ESOPs&quot;) and Individual Retirement Accounts (&quot;IRAs&quot;). Championed by Senators Jacob K. Javits, Harrison A. Williams, Russell Long, and Gaylord Nelson, and by Representatives John Dent and John Erlenborn.
* 1985: The First Cash Balance Plan - Kwasha Lipton creates it by amending the plan document of Bank of America pension plan. The linguistic move was to avoid mentioning actual individual accounts but using the words &quot;hypothetical account&quot; or &quot;notional account&quot;.
* 1991: A Magazine article claims that pension- and retirement funds own 40% of American common stock and represent $2.5 trillion in assets.
* Growth and Decline of Defined Benefit Pension Plans in the United States. In 1980 there were approximately 250,000 qualified defined benefit pension plans covered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. By 2005, there are less than 80,000 qualified plans.
* Fewer and Fewer: Defined benefit plans continue to dwindle, becoming exception rather than rule. As of 2011, only 10% of private employers offered pension plans, accounting for 18% of the private workforce.

<doc id="1112757" wikidata="Q3398425" url="?curid=1112757" title="D. J. Williams (Welsh nationalist)">
<text>David John Williams (26 June 1885 – 4 January 1970) was one of the foremost Welsh-language writers of the twentieth century and a prominent Welsh nationalist.

== Life ==
Williams was born at Pen-rhiw, a farmhouse near Llansawel, Carmarthenshire, moving with his family to a smaller farm, Abernant, near Rhydcymerau in 1891. He left home in 1902 and spent four years working in the south Wales coalfield. He resumed his studies, eventually studying English at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and Jesus College, Oxford. At Oxford he became friends Flora Forster, who declined his offers of marriage. For most of his life he taught English at the grammar school in Fishguard (now Ysgol Bro Gwaun), Pembrokeshire.

He died in 1970 in Rhydcymerau.

== Politics ==
A socialist, he was one of the founders of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh National Party, in 1925. He took part, with Saunders Lewis and Lewis Valentine, in the symbolic burning of a bombing school in Penyberth in north-west Wales in 1936, for which he served nine months in Wormwood Scrubs prison.

== Literary career ==
Williams was a short story writer of renown and also the author of two volumes of autobiography. All his work is inspired by his vision of his native locality, of a close-knit community where common values give worth to all. &quot;Hen Dŷ Ffarm&quot; (&quot;The old farmhouse&quot;) was translated into English by poet Waldo Williams in 1953 as part of a UNESCO programme to promote minority languages to wider audiences.

He held the Irish journalist and poet George William Russell, who wrote with the pseudonym Æ, in high regard, publishing a pamphlet &quot;A.E. a Chymru&quot; (&#x27;A.E. and Wales&#x27;) in 1929 and a translation of Æ&#x27;s &quot;The National Being&quot; under the title &quot;Y Bod Cenhedlig&quot; in 1963.

<text>SquirrelMail is a project that aims to provide both a web-based email client and a proxy server for the IMAP protocol.

The latest stable version 1.4.23-svn is tested with PHP up to version 8.1 and replaces version 1.4.22 which can only run on PHP version 5.0-5.4. The svn part in the version name points out that bugfixes and minor improvements are no longer published as new versions, but instead are maintained within Apache Subversion version control system.

== History ==
The webmail portion of the project was started by Nathan and Luke Ehresman in 1999 and is written in PHP. SquirrelMail can be employed in conjunction with a LAMP &quot;stack&quot;, and any other operating systems that support PHP are supported as well. The web server needs access to the IMAP server hosting the email and to an SMTP server to be able to send mails.

SquirrelMail webmail outputs valid HTML 4.0 for its presentation, making it compatible with a majority of current web browsers. SquirrelMail webmail uses a plugin architecture to accommodate additional features around the core application, and over 200 plugins are available on the SquirrelMail website.

The SquirrelMail IMAP proxy server product was created in 2002 by Dave McMurtrie while at the University of Pittsburgh (where it was named &quot;up-imapproxy&quot;, although it has become more commonly known as &quot;imapproxy&quot;) and adopted by the SquirrelMail team in 2010. It is written in C and is primarily made to provide stateful connections for stateless webmail client software to an IMAP server, thus avoiding new IMAP logins for every client action and in some cases significantly improving webmail performance.

Both SquirrelMail products are free and open-source software subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version.

SquirrelMail webmail was included in the repositories of many major Linux distributions
and is independently downloaded by thousands of people every month.

==Platforms==
SquirrelMail webmail is available for any platform supporting PHP. Most commonly used platforms include Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and the server variants of Microsoft Windows. SquirrelMail IMAP Proxy compiles on most flavors of Unix, and can generally be used on the same platforms that the webmail product can with the exception of Microsoft Windows, unless used in a Cygwin or similar environment. Apple shipped SquirrelMail as their supported web mail solution in Mac OS X Server.

==Plugins==
The SquirrelMail webmail client itself is a complete webmail system, but extra features are available in the form of plugins. There are over 200 third-party plugins available for download from the SquirrelMail website and SquirrelMail ships with several &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;core&quot; plugins.

==Internationalization==
SquirrelMail webmail has been translated into over 50 languages including Arabic, Chinese, French, German, and Spanish.

==Notable installations==
SquirrelMail has been implemented as the official email system of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office of the Republic of India for its security advantages over Microsoft&#x27;s Outlook Express.

In 2004 HEC Montréal business school deployed SquirrelMail as part of a comprehensive webmail solution, to support thousands of users.

<text>A sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) is one of the categories of top-level domains (TLDs) maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for use in the Domain Name System of the Internet, alongside country-code top-level domains (ccTLD) and generic top-level domains (gTLD).

A sponsored TLD is a specialized top-level domain that has a sponsor representing a specific community served by the domain. The communities involved are based on ethnic, geographical, professional, technical or other theme concepts proposed by private agencies or organizations that establish and enforce rules restricting the eligibility of registrants to use the TLD.

Generally speaking, a sponsored TLD is a specialized TLD that has a sponsor representing the narrower community that is most affected by the TLD, while an unsponsored TLD operates under policies established by the global Internet community directly through the ICANN process. For example, the .aero TLD is sponsored by SITA, which limits registrations to members of the air transport industry.
ICANN only applied the term sponsored TLD to TLDs in the first two rounds of new gTLDs. It did not use the distinction between sponsored and unsponsored for new gTLDs in the 2012 round. Moreover, some sTLDs migrated to non-sponsored gTLDs on the Registry Agreement renewal.
==Types==
As of 2015, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:

*infrastructure top-level domain (ARPA)
*generic top-level domains (gTLD)
*restricted generic top-level domains (grTLD)
*sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)
*country code top-level domains (ccTLD)
*test top-level domains (tTLD)

<text>Zhima Jie () is the Chinese co-production of Sesame Street. The show was produced from 1998 to 2001, for a total run of 130 half-hour episodes. It was filmed in Shanghai and aired on Shanghai Television.

== History ==
Before the co-production, &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; 12th season had been dubbed into Mandarin in 1981 and distributed through China Central Television.

=== 1998 version ===
Pre-production on the show was headed in part by a team of eighteen Chinese child education specialists, led by Xie Xide. In 1996 some of the Shanghai Television producers also traveled to New York to meet and work with Sesame Workshop staff. Kevin Clash ran the auditions and training for the production&#x27;s puppeteers.

Unlike other international co-productions, Zhima Jie would have its own version of Big Bird, Da Niao, rather than a new full-body mascot unique to their iteration. This was due to Big Bird&#x27;s already existing popularity in China. Caroll Spinney, who originated the character on the American production, had final say on who would play the character.

General Electric sponsored the show from 1998 to 2001. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive it for the 2004 season.

=== 2010 version ===
As with the 1998 version, the 2010 version filmed original segments in Shanghai.

It returned in December 2010 as Zhima Jie: Da Niao Kan Shijie (芝麻街: 大鸟看世界, Sesame Street: Big Bird Looks at the World). It has aired on CCTV Children&#x27;s Channel, Guangdong Jiajia, and on Toonmax Channel.

The program focused on teaching basic skills, such as literacy, numeracy, and an appreciation of the arts, and was funded in part by the Merck Foundation.

==Characters==

=== 1998 ===
* Xiao Mei Zi (小梅子), Little Plum, a red Elmo-like monster who is 3 years old and enjoys reading books and listening to stories. 
* Hu Hu Zhu (呼呼猪), Puffing Pig, is a furry blue pig who is similar to Cookie Monster. He loves arts, especially opera.
* Da Niao (大鸟), Big Bird&#x27;s identical cousin, who lives at a park in a nest and enjoys eating bird seed cookies.
** Played by Zhu Ming and dubbed by LaLa Ma

=== 2010 ===
* Tiger Lily, a tiger cub.
* Elmo, a furry red monster from Sesame Street
* Old Lady Wang, owner of a noodle shop and practitioner of tai chi

== Messaging ==
Like other international co-productions, Zhima Jie covered the four broad curriculum categories of &quot;Child&#x27;s World&quot; (understanding the self), &quot;Family and Society&quot;, &quot;Symbolic Representation&quot; (reading and numeracy) and &quot;Cognitive Organization&quot; (classification and perception). However, the production also added a fifth category of &quot;Aesthetics and Arts&quot;, which included coverage of Chinese calligraphy, experiencing nature, dance, and music composition.

The 1998 production had compassion as one of the primary themes for the first season. It also included segments showing cultural diversity within China and reminding children that failure is okay. The show also had bumpers lasting thirty seconds which aimed to teach specific scientific concepts, like relative buoyancy of different objects.

The 2010 production focused on science education and emergency preparedness. Having episodes focus primarily on science allowed creators to explore a topic with more depth than would be possible in a shorter segment. Episodes started with characters posing a question, followed by an explanation using examples or videos, and ending with children in the studio performing related activities on their own.

== Episodes ==
The 1998-2001 production reportedly consisted of 130 half-hour episodes. As it did not see home video releases, only a few clips of the show have surfaced on the internet. 

The 2010 production totaled 52 11-minute episodes.

==Books==
* Sesame Street School Readiness (11 titles)
* Sesame Street Thinking Child (6 titles)
* Sesame Street Learning Environment (4 titles)

== In other media ==
From 2014 through 2019, characters from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Zhima Jie&quot; guest-starred on &quot;Bai Nian La&quot; (拜年啦), broadcast every Chinese New Year (January 31, 2014 – February 5, 2019). These six years were the Year of the Horse, the Goat, the Monkey, the Rooster, the Dog, and the Pig.

<text>Greetsiel is a small port on the bight of Leybucht in western East Frisia, Germany, that was first documented in letters from the year 1388. Since 1972, Greetsiel has been part of the municipality of Krummhörn, which has its administrative seat in Pewsum. The nearest railway station is at Emden, about away, and the two towns are linked by a bus service.

Although originally just a small but picturesque fishing village, Greetsiel has become a major tourist attraction. In December 2006, it had 1,534 inhabitants, but the number of people living in the village significantly increases during the summer months and over the Christmas holidays.

== Geography ==
Greetsiel is situated on the Leybucht, a small bay on the East Frisian coast. Over time, large parts of the bay were reclaimed behind dykes, so that Greetsiel is the only port in the bay today.

In the 1990s, the &quot;Leybuchthörn&quot; was completed. This structure extends as a spit out into the Wadden Sea. Within the &quot;Leybuchthörn&quot; is a reservoir and the approach channel from the North Sea into Greetsiel Harbour (&quot;Greetsieler Hafen&quot;). Between the port and the open sea is a lock. Since the completion of the structure, Greetsiel Harbour has been accessible from the sea, irrespective of the tide.

The distance to the nearest towns of Emden and Norden is to the north and south respectively.

== History ==
Greetsiel is first mentioned in the records in letters dating to the year 1388 (Ocko I tom Brok). At that time, Hamburg&#x27;s ships lay at anchor in the port of Greetsiel and had to pay tariffs.

The place was founded by the Domain of Appingen under the chiefs of Cirksena. While Appingen increasingly lost its importance, Greetsiel became the seat of the chief. In 1462 Count Edzard the Great was born at the Cirksenaburg; under his rule East Frisia extended from the River Weser as far as Groningen. In 1547 Ubbo Emmius was born here. On old Dutch maps the town is marked as &quot;Grietjezijl&quot;.

In creating the municipality of Krummhörn in 1972, a debate erupted over whether the administrative headquarters should be Pewsum or Greetsiel. Because Greetsiel was a more isolated location, Pewsum was preferred.

== Culture and points of interest ==

=== Buildings ===
Of all the East Frisian &quot;Siel&quot; villages (a &quot;Siel&quot; is a sluice in a dyke), Greetsiel has the best preserved old fishermen&#x27;s cottages. In its picturesque fishing harbour there are still 28 shrimp cutters (&quot;Krabbenkutter&quot;). Other notable buildings are:
*&quot;Greetsiel Church&quot;, an Evangelical Reformed church. The rectangular, brick, aisleless church (&quot;Saalkirche&quot;) was built between 1380 and 1410 as the private church of the chief, Haro Edzardsna, in two stages. In 1401, long before its final completion, it was to be consecrated to Saint Mary. The building is crowned by a small flèche (&quot;Dachreiter&quot;) decorated with a clock. This is adorned by a 1730 weather vane in the shape of a ship. The actual clock tower stands off to one side. The simple interior, which at one time had a flat ceiling, has been covered by a slightly vaulted wooden ceiling since 1852. The organ was completely renovated in 1963, but its case is from 1738; the pulpit, however, had already been made in 1669.
*&quot;Steinhaus&quot;, the former seat of the Cirksena family. The brick building at the end of the high street (&quot;Hohe Straße&quot;) was built about 1600 on the foundations of a previous building erected around 1390. In the interior the original hall has been restored in the course of renovation work.
*&quot;Houses&quot;. Among the most famous photographic motifs in Greetsiel is the row of houses on &quot;Sielstraße&quot; flanking the harbour. The houses at &quot;No. 11&quot; and &quot;No. 15&quot;, with their bell-shaped gables based on Dutch designs, are particularly striking. While the former is dated 1741, No. 15 was built in 1792. The &quot;Poppingas Old Bakery&quot; (&quot;Poppingas Alte Bäckerei&quot;), No. 21, from the 19th century is also found on &quot;Sielstraße&quot; and is used now as a museum, cafe and gallery; its interior has been preserved unchanged. Near the church is the so-called High House (&quot;Hohes Haus&quot;) at 1, &quot;Hohe Straße&quot;, a two-storey, sideways-on, brick building, which once served as the seat of the treasurer or &quot;Rentmeister&quot;. According to the anchor plate on the gable it dates to &quot;1696&quot;, but is thought to have already been in decline by the middle of the 16th century. Today the building, whose street façade is covered with an ashlar facing, houses a hotel. The &quot;Amtmannshaus&quot; on &quot;Neuer Deich&quot; is probably from the same period, but was extensively renovated during the 19th century. In the latest renovation the exterior appearance of the house and its associated Gulf barn was changed significantly by the addition of modern dormers. In &quot;Mühlenstraße&quot; is &quot;Haus von Halem&quot;, built in 1794 and one of the most important residential examples of neoclassical architecture in East Frisia. The two-storey brick building with a hip roof is divided by a huge pilasters. The portal has a richly carved fanlights in the late rococo style.

=== Windmills ===

The twin windmills () of Greetsiel-West date from 1856 (green) and Greetsiel-Ost from 1706 (red, renovated in 1921 with parts of Aurich&#x27;s &quot;Wallmühle&quot; mill of 1750). They are smock mills ().

=== Other places of interest ===
Other places of interest include the scoop wheel, the old &quot;Siel&quot; (1798), the new &quot;Siel&quot; (1887) and the Pilsum Lighthouse. Greetsiel also hosts the largest ship-in-a-bottle museum in Germany and Europe, with about 800 examples. Of all the places in the municipality of Krummhörn, Greetsiel has the highest influx of tourists.

=== Regular events ===
An annual painting and art exhibition, known as Greetsiel Week (&quot;Greetsieler Woche&quot;), is of national prominence. It has been running for more than 30 years and exhibits a range of works including art, ceramics, goldsmiths&#x27; products and sculptures. Every two years, the Imke Folkerts Prize for Fine Arts, worth 10,000 euros, is awarded at the event. Qualifying entries include works in the fields of art, graphics, photography and sculpture. There are also regular exhibitions in Greetsiel&#x27;s twin windmills. Every year in mid-summer is the boat parade in which the majority of Greetsiel&#x27;s cutters take part. The crews take guests on a roughly four-hour boat trip. The port also hosts a supporting programme of events with music and shrimp-shelling competitions.

== Transport ==

Greetsiel is linked by state roads to Norden and Emden and from there the A 31.

At one time, the Emden-Pewsum-Greetsiel light railway linked Pewsum and Greetsiel with Emden. The operation of the gauge railway began in 1899 between Emden and Pewsum and, in 1906, the line was extended to Greetsiel. &quot;Kleinbahnstraße&quot; in Greetsiel recalls that period, along which there are still several railway buildings that are now used for other purposes. The narrow-gauge railway was closed in 1963, and passenger services have been taken over by buses since then. Today, Greetsiel is connected by bus with the former county town of Norden as well as Emden.

Greetsiel can also be reached by smaller boats from Emden. The &quot;Alte Greetsieler Sieltief&quot; and the &quot;Neue Greetsieler Sieltief&quot; connect the port with the East Frisian inland waterways network.

<text>El Vallès (or simply Vallès) is a historical county in Catalonia, Spain, located in the center of the Catalan Pre-Coastal Range. It is nowadays represented by two separate administrative divisions (&quot;comarques&quot;) which are part of the Barcelona Province: the Western Vallès, which has two capitals, Sabadell and Terrassa; and the Eastern Vallès, with Granollers as its capital.

The present division of Vallès has its historical roots in the legal districts of Granollers and Terrassa, established in 1834. However, the first time this subdivision was explicitly used as sanctioned by law was in 1936, with the official division of Catalonia in &quot;comarques&quot;. In 2015, four of the municipalities in Eastern Vallès became part of a newly created &quot;comarca&quot;: the Moianès. Some parts of the Vallès region belong to the metropolitan area of Barcelona and the Àmbit Metropolità de Barcelona(metropolitan region of Barcelona), and is nowadays connected with Barcelona with public transportations systems such as FGC&#x27;s so-called &quot;Metro del Vallès&quot;.

<text>Harrow is a community located in the town of Essex, Ontario, Canada.

==History==

First known as &quot;Munger&#x27;s Corners&quot; after John Munger, the first postmaster, the town was renamed by John O&#x27;Connor in 1857 for the exclusive Harrow School in London.

Hiram Walker, of Canadian Club Whisky fame, is credited with putting Harrow on the map. Walker built a railway which brought grain from the south end of the county into the city of Windsor for use in his distillery. The tracks remained for over 100 years, and were removed in 1992. The line became the Chrysler Canada Greenway, part of the Trans Canada Trail.

Walker&#x27;s distillation operations remained in Harrow until 2009, when the Canbar, Inc. cooperage closed.

Harrow was also home to Ontario&#x27;s last segregated school, which was finally closed in the 1960s.

In 1999, the town of Harrow amalgamated with the town of Essex. The government of Essex was divided into four wards consisting of six elected councillors, plus a mayor. Harrow is the fourth ward and has a single councillor in the government.

The town was home to Harrow District High School, formerly Canada&#x27;s southernmost high school until it was closed in 2016.

==Today==
Though early settlers were mostly German, a thriving community of Portuguese came later and still remain. Today Harrow is a community situated along scenic County Road 20 that offers shops and places for antique hunters. Attractions include Colio Winery and the historic John R. Park Homestead.

Harrow has organized and hosted an annual agricultural fair every Labour Day weekend for over 150 years, and many people from Essex County and other parts of Ontario attend. Highlights of the fair include a mom calling contest, a pie auction, live entertainment, &quot;bossy&quot; bingo and a tractor pull. The Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Harrow Research and Development Centre is also located in Harrow. Atlas Tube, a unit of Zekelman Industries, owned by the Zekelman family, is located on the outskirts of town.

== Demographics ==
The 2001 Census was the last Canadian census to record demographic statistics for Harrow as a separate community. In the 2006 Census, statistics were published only for Essex.

For 2001 census:

<text>USS &quot;Manta&quot; (SS/ESS/AGSS-299), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the first submarine and second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the manta.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Manta&quot; was laid down on 15 January 1943 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; launched on 7 November 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Michael J. Bradley; and commissioned on 18 December 1944.

==Service history==
Upon completion of her shakedown cruise, &quot;Manta&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, 27 March 1945 for Hawaii via the Panama Canal. She sailed from Pearl Harbor 28 May 1945 for her first war patrol, off the Kurile Islands. Returning 16 July, she began her second patrol 8 August and ended it with the cessation of hostilities 15 August.

Returning to Pearl Harbor 10 September, &quot;Manta&quot; engaged in training through December. On 2 January 1946, she sailed for San Francisco and preinactivation overhaul. She was decommissioned 10 June 1946 and placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Manta&quot; recommissioned 2 August 1949, Lt. E. H. Edwards, Jr., in command, as ESS-299. On 1 September she was redesignated AGSS-299 and ordered to Key West, Fla. For the next 4 years she operated as a target ship for experimental antisubmarine warfare projects of Operational Development Force, Atlantic Fleet.

On 5 July 1955, &quot;Manta&quot; departed Key West for Portsmouth, N.H., to prepare for inactivation. Towed to New London, she decommissioned 6 December 1955 and was placed in the Inactive Reserve Fleet. In April 1960 she was assigned to Naval Reserve training duties with the 3rd Naval District. Declared as excess to the needs of the Navy, she was struck from the Navy List on 30 June 1967 and sunk as an aircraft target off Hampton, Virginia on 16 July 1969.

<doc id="1112801" wikidata="Q161864" url="?curid=1112801" title="Mourvèdre">
<text>Mourvèdre (; also known as Mataro or Monastrell) is a red wine grape variety grown in many regions around the world. It is found in the Rhône and Provence regions of France, the Valencia and Jumilla, Bullas and Yecla &quot;denominaciones de origen&quot; (DOs) of Spain, as well as the Balearic Islands, California and Washington and the Australian regions of South Australia and New South Wales, plus South Africa. In addition to making red varietal wines, Mourvèdre is a prominent component in &quot;GSM&quot; (Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre) blends. The variety is also used to make rosé and port-style fortified wines.

Mourvèdre tends to produce tannic wines that can be high in alcohol. The style of wine produced from the grapes varies greatly according to where it is produced, but according to wine expert Jancis Robinson Mourvèdre wines often have wild game, or earthy notes to them, with soft red fruit flavors. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, young Mourvèdre can come across as faulted due to the reductive, sulfur notes and &quot;farmyard-y&quot; flavors that some wines can exhibit before those flavors mellow with age.

The variety can be a difficult grape to grow, preferring &quot;its face in the hot sun and its feet in the water&quot; meaning that it needs very warm weather, a low leaf-to-fruit ratio but adequate water or irrigation to produce intensely flavored fruit that is not overly jammy or herbaceous. The vines&#x27; susceptibility to many viticultural hazards such as powdery and downy mildew as well as overly vigorous foliage can present additional problems for vine growers.

==History==
Most wine historians agree that Mourvèdre is likely to be Spanish in origin, though its exact history is difficult to pinpoint. The variety was probably introduced to Valencia by the Phoenicians around 500 BC. The French-adapted name probably came from ( in Valencian, nowadays Sagunt) near Valencia while the name Mataro is thought to have come from Mataró, Catalonia near the modern-day city of Barcelona. 

Despite this close association with Murviedro and Mataró, the grape became known in Spain as Monastrell for reasons that are still unknown though Oz Clarke speculates that a &quot;neutral&quot; name may have been chosen so as not to offend the local pride of both regions.

Mourvèdre had a well-established presence in Roussillon region of France by at least the 16th century when still part of Spain (until 1659) where it spread eastwards towards Provence and the Rhone. There it had a well established foothold until the phylloxera epidemic of the mid to late 19th century decimated plantings. As the French and other European wine regions recovered from the phylloxera scourge by grafting &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; varieties to American rootstock, it was discovered that Mourvèdre vines did not take well to the grafting and many vineyards were replanted with other varieties.

Mourvèdre arrived in California in the 1860s as part of the Pellier collection. The variety, known as Mataro, was used primarily for bulk produced jug wines. In the 1980s and 90s, interest in Mourvèdre as a premium grape variety picked up as the Rhone Rangers began seeking out old-vine plantings of the variety in the eastern part of Contra Costa County. In the 1990s, critically acclaimed bottlings from Bonny Doon Vineyard and Cline Cellars Winery promoted demand in the variety and by the mid-2000s, plantings of Mourvèdre in California had risen to 260 ha (650 acres).

In Australia, the variety (known there as Mataro) has had a long history in the country with plantings dating back to the mid-19th century. In the 1980s, many of these old vine plantings were uprooted in a government sponsored vine pulling scheme but some still survive and are producing today. While historically the variety was used mainly as an anonymous blending grape in fortified wines, the variety saw a rise in interest in the 1990s as producers started receiving acclaim for GSM (Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre) blends (many from the surviving, low yield old vine plantings). With a slight increase in planting there were more than 1000 ha of Mataro in Australia by the mid-2000s.

It has been put forward by Ampelographists that Mourvèdre may be the parent to the esteemed grape Mavrud, or that at least Mavrud is a clone of Mourvèdre, imported into Bulgaria by the Romans.

==Viticulture==
According to ampelographer Pierre Galet Mourvèdre thrives in warm climates as the variety has a tendency to both bud and ripen very late. While the variety can recover well from late spring frost due to the late budding, it can be very temperature sensitive throughout its growing season with even low winter temperatures affecting its dormancy. Though the grape can adapt to a variety of vineyard soil types, the most ideal sites are very warm, south facing (Northern hemisphere) slopes with shallow, clay soils that can retain the necessary moisture to keep the vines &quot;feet&quot; wet without letting it grow its foliage too vigorously. In addition to a warm climate, Mourvèdre also does best in a dry climate with sufficient wind to protect it from the viticultural hazards of powdery mildew and downy mildew.

The grape clusters of Mourvèdre are relatively compact, enhancing its susceptibility to mildew, with small thick-skinned berries that are high in both color and flavor phenolics, particularly tannins. Even though the variety ripens late, it has the potential to ripen to high Brix sugar levels which can translate into a high alcohol level during fermentation. The vine can also be very vigorous, producing abundant foliage that can shade the grape clusters, affecting canopy management decisions for growers. In Australia and California, many of the oldest plantings of Mourvèdre are bush trained as the vines grows well vertically but the variety can be grown under many different kinds of vine training systems.

The harvest window for the grape tends to be very short once it reaches peak ripeness, with acidity rapidly falling and the grapes soon desiccating and developing &quot;prune-y&quot; flavors. One advantage of the thick skins is that Mourvèdre can withstand late harvest rains without the berries swelling and bursting like thinner skin varieties such as Grenache. In regions such as the Paso Robles AVA of California, it is often one of the last varieties to be harvested sometimes hanging onto the vine until early November.

Mourvèdre produces medium-size, compact bunches that are usually conical in shape with a small wing cluster that may be discarded during green harvesting. The leaves often have truncate cuneiform &quot;wedge&quot; shape. Since World War II, newer clones and better rootstock have been developed that have allowed Mourvèdre vines to be grafted more easily. Today many plantings of Mourvèdre are to 110R and 41B rootstocks.

==Wine regions==
===Spain===
In Spain, Mourvèdre is called Monastrell and was the fourth most widely planted red wine grape variety with in 2015. Like many other Spanish varieties, its numbers have been declining in recent years (in 1996 there was over 100,000 ha/250,000 of the vine planted in Spain) as growers pull up older plantings and replant them with popular international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. However, the variety still has a strong hold in eastern Spain where it is widely planted in several Spanish wine regions around Murcia and the Valencian Community. Under Spanish wine law, Monastrell is one of the primary red wine grape varieties in the DOPs of Jumilla, Yecla, Valencia, Almansa, and Alicante.

Other Spanish DOPs where Monastrell is a permitted variety include Binissalem-Mallorca and Plà i Llevant in the Balearic Islands, Bullas, Catalunya, Cariñena, Costers del Segre, Manchuela, Penedès and Ribera del Guadiana. Monastrell is also permitted in the sparkling wine Cava though it is rarely used.

===France===
In France, Mourvèdre doesn&#x27;t grow much farther north than the Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC in the southern Rhône; and even there it has some trouble ripening in cooler vintages. It tends to ripen most consistently in the warmer Provençal region of Bandol AOC along the Mediterranean coast where the growing season is often 5 °C warmer. While plantings have been declining in Spain, they have been increasing in France, particularly in the Languedoc-Roussillon region where the grape variety has seen growing popularity as both a varietal wine and as a blending component. 

After the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century and with declining interest in the variety for most of the 20th century, there were less than 900 ha in 1968, mostly in the southern Rhône and the Bandol AOC of Provence. But the spark of interest and international investment in the Languedoc saw planting sharply increase and by 2000 there were over 7,600 ha of Mourvèdre planted throughout Southern France.
While Bandol is the AOC region that most prominently features Mourvèdre (by law all red Bandols must contain at least 50% Mourvèdre), other &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC)s that have Mourvèdre as a permitted variety include Cassis, Collioure, Corbières, Costières de Nîmes, Coteaux d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence, Coteaux du Languedoc, Coteaux de Pierrevert, Coteaux Varois, Côtes du Luberon, Coteaux du Tricastin, Côtes de Provence, Côtes du Rhône, Côtes du Rhône Villages, Côtes du Roussillon, Côtes du Roussillon Villages, Côtes du Ventoux, Faugères, Fitou, Palette, Saint-Chinian, Gigondas, Lirac, Minervois and Vacqueyras. 

In Châteauneuf-du-Pape it is one of the 18 permitted varieties in the red wine but is often a secondary component behind Grenache and Syrah. The exceptions are notable blends from producers such as Château de Beaucastel which often has Mourvèdre account for more than a third of the blend. As of 2009, Mourvèdre accounted for 6.6% (213 ha) of all Châteauneuf-du-Pape plantings.

=== New World ===
In the United States, Mourvèdre is found primarily in California and Washington State with some limited plantings in Arizona, Missouri, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and Virginia. In the US, the style of Mourvèdre tends to be less tannic than Old World examples such as Bandols. In Washington State, the grape was first planted at Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1983. The 1990s and 2000s saw an increase of plantings of the variety, most notably at Alder Ridge Vineyard and Destiny Ridge Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills AVA and Ciel du Cheval Vineyard in the Red Mountain AVA. In Washington, the grape is used in both varietal and Rhone-style blends where it provides a medium body structure with cherry fruit flavors as well smokey, spicy and gamy notes.
In California, Mourvèdre reached the United States in the 1860s as part of the Pellier collection and was likely first planted in Santa Clara County. The variety, known as Mataro, was widely planted in anonymous field blends that was used primarily for bulk produced jug wines. From the middle of the 20th century, it saw its plantings rapidly decline from more than 2700 acres in 1968 to less than a third of that by the 2000s. Its numbers would have declined more drastically had the variety not captured the interest of Rhone Rangers in the 1980s and 90s, who began seeking out old-vine plantings of the variety in vineyards Contra Costa County. On the heels of some critically acclaimed varietal and Rhone-style blends (as well as the introduction of better quality clones) featuring Mourvèdre, plantings in California rose slightly from 260 ha (650 acres) at the turn of the 21st century to 900 acres in 2010.

There are around 12 square kilometres of Mourvèdre in Australia, where it is also known as Mataro, though more producers have begun adopting the French name Mourvèdre. While the grape has a long history of being used for generic cask wines and fortified wine, it has recently become more popular in highly acclaimed GSM blends with Grenache and Syrah. Like many grape varieties, Mourvèdre was first introduced to Australia as part of James Busby&#x27;s collection of cuttings from his European travels in the 1830s. There it was quickly established in the South Australia wine region of the Barossa Valley by Lutheran immigrants from the Silesia Province in Prussia. From there it was spread by English immigrants to the McLaren Vale region south of Adelaide. Some of the oldest continually producing vines of Mourvèdre are in the New South Wales wine region of Riverina or South Australian wine region of Riverland. Turkey Flat Vineyards in the Barossa Valley was one of the forerunners of producing Mourvèdre as a single varietal wine with its first vintage in 2005.

=== Other regions ===

According to Pierre Galet, there are some plantings of Mourvèdre in Azerbaijan under a variety of synonyms that have not all been fully identified. In South Africa, Rhone-style producers have also begun working with the variety.

== Winemaking and wine styles ==
The small, thick-skin berries of Mourvèdre are high in phenolic compounds that have the potential to produce a deeply colored, very tannic wine with significant alcohol levels if harvested at high sugar levels. However, the variety is rarely harvested at sugar levels below 13% alcohol (approx 23 Brix) because the flavors at those lower levels are often very weak and herbaceous. 

In winemaking, wines made from Mourvèdre are prone to both oxidation and reductive flavors (such as hydrogen sulfide) if care is not taken at the winery. While in Bandol, it is common to ferment Mourvèdre with the stems, the grapes usually go through a crusher/destemmer in New World regions such as a California due to the harsher, green tannins that are more typical of the stems in those regions. While the wine can be stored in oak barrels, it often does not absorb oak flavors as well as other varieties (such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) so it is often stored in neutral oak or large format barrels.

In many regions of the world, Mourvèdre is often blended with other varieties such as Grenache and Syrah in the &quot;GSM&quot; blends of Rhône, Australia and the United States. In these blends, Mourvèdre often provides color, fruit and some tannic structure to complement the fruity Grenache and elegant Syrah. In Provence and Rhône it also sometimes blended with Cinsault and Carignan as part of both red table wines and &quot;rosé&quot;. In Australia, the variety is sometimes used in fortified port-style wines.

According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, in favorable vintages Mourvèdre can produce highly perfumed wines with intense fruit flavors and notes of blackberries and gamey or meaty flavors. Oz Clarke notes that some examples of Mourvèdre may come across as faulted in their youth with &quot;farmyard-y&quot; and strong herbal flavors. As the wine ages, more earthy tertiary aromas may develop before becoming more leather and gingerbread aroma notes.

In both Old and New World wine regions, Mourvèdre is a popular grape to be used in &quot;rosé&quot; winemaking. These wines can be made as a dedicated &quot;rosé&quot; where the skins are allowed only a brief period of skin contact (a few hours or a single day) before they are pressed or as &quot;saignée&quot; where some of the juice destined for a red Mourvèdre is &quot;bled off&quot; during fermentation creating two separate wines—a darker, more concentrated red wine and the lighter &quot;rosé&quot;.

==Synonyms and relationship to other grapes==

Mourvèdre is the name used in France. Worldwide, there are 95 other names, including Mataro, which is used in Portugal and parts of the New World; and Monastrell, which is used in Spain. In English-speaking wine producing areas, Mourvèdre is most commonly used; it is the official name used by the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Despite the similarities of its synonyms, Mourvèdre has no relation to the Spanish wine grape Graciano which is also known as Morrastel in France.

At one point, the Cognac grape Balzac blanc was thought to be a color mutation of Mourvèdre due to the similarities in synonyms with Mourvèdre also being known as Balzac noir. However, DNA analysis at the turn of the 21st century showed that the two varieties had no relation. Despite having the synonym &quot;Rossola nera&quot;, Mourvèdre has no known relationship to the Lombardy wine grape of the same name with the latter being an offspring of the Piedmontese wine grape Nebbiolo.

<text>The British Rail Class 375 &quot;Electrostar&quot; is an electric multiple unit train that was built at Derby Litchurch Lane Works, thirty units by Adtranz from 1999 to 2001, and 110 units by Bombardier Transportation (successors to Adtranz) from 2001 to 2004. The class form part of the Electrostar family of units, which also includes classes 357, 376, 377, 378, 379 and 387, the most numerous type of EMU introduced since the privatisation of British Rail.

These units form the basis of Southeastern&#x27;s mainline fleet.

==Description==


Introduced into service in 2000, these trains are owned by Eversholt Rail Group (formerly HSBC Rail) and leased to Southeastern for operation from London to Kent and parts of East Sussex.

The Class 375 is the principal train used by Southeastern, and replaced the slam-door Mark 1 derived stock, which was more than 40 years old and did not meet modern health and safety requirements and replaced the 16 Class 365s which were transferred to WAGN in 2004. All units have been converted from Tightlock to Dellner couplers.

==Refurbishment==

In May 2015, unit 375301 was moved from Ramsgate Depot to Derby Litchurch Lane Works for a full refurbishment. On 16 May 2015, it was returned to the Kent depot wearing a new livery, similar to, but not based on the &#x27;Highspeed&#x27; livery carried by the high speed Class 395 EMU, with a more vibrant shade of blue on the saloon doors and bolder stripes to highlight First Class and Disabled areas. Internally, the unit has received new carpets and lino flooring, new table top covers and the grab poles, side panels and table legs have been re-powder coated. The existing seat covers have been retained, but were dry cleaned to provide a brighter, cleaner interior. This work will also involve combining the two separate First Class sections on four car units into one section in the end of MOSL coach. It is intended for all class 375 units to receive this refurbishment between 2015 and 2018. The original plan was for the first 50 units (375/3s, 375/6s and 375/7s) to be refurbished at Bombardier in Derby and then the remaining units would be transferred for refurbishment at Bombardier Ilford. This plan did not go ahead and the 375/8s and 375/9s were sent to Derby. On 19 September 2015 the last 375/3 unit no 375310 went to Derby for refurbishment. The following week on 26 September the first 375/6 went to Derby for refurbishment. The final 375 to receive the refurbishment and gain the new blue Southeastern livery was 375 920, which was returned to Ramsgate depot on 28 April 2018.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 8 November 2010, a passenger train operated by unit 375 711 overran station, on the Hastings Line in East Sussex, due to low railhead adhesion in the leaf fall season and maintenance errors in respect of the train&#x27;s sanding apparatus. The train continued to slide beyond the station for . Following the incident, Southeastern reduced the interval that the sand hoppers were to be refilled from seven days to five days.
* On 24 November 2014, the front carriage of unit 375 611 caught fire from faulty electrical insulation pots at Platform 6. There were no injuries, though both the track and leading carriage required repairs, part of the rail being melted.
* On 26 July 2015, units 375 703 and 375 612 formed a train that collided with a herd of cattle on the line at Godmersham, between and , Kent. The leading carriage of 375 703 was derailed. There were no injuries amongst the 70 passengers and crew on board.
* On 5 January 2018, unit 375 815 hit a fallen tree near Herne Bay. Though damage was sustained to the leading carriage, there were no injuries.
* On 24 October 2018, shortly before midnight unit 375 301 leading 375 906 hit a car abandoned on a level crossing between Teynham and Faversham. The car caught fire and the leading carriage of 375 301 sustained damage to its corridor, bogie and coupling.

==Operations==
===Main lines===
Class 375s work the following main line routes:
* Charing Cross – Tunbridge Wells and Hastings fast services
* Charing Cross – Dover Priory and Ramsgate via Ashford International.
* Victoria – Ramsgate and Dover Priory via Chatham
* Cannon Street - Ramsgate/Broadstairs via Chatham (peak hours only)

===Outer suburban===
Class 375s also work the following outer suburban Southeastern routes interchangeably with Class 377/5 and Class 465/9 units:
* Charing Cross – Tunbridge Wells
* Victoria/ Charing Cross – Ashford International and Maidstone East,
* Victoria - Dover Priory via Denmark Hill and Gillingham (Kent)
* Victoria - Canterbury East/ Faversham (Sundays only)

===Medway Valley Line===
Class 375/3 Electrostar units started operating services on the Medway Valley Line from May 2012 to January 2016, and then from September 2016 to the present day. Previously Class 466 Networkers were the regular units on this line with the occasional Class 465 Networker or 4-car 375 Electrostar being used as a substitute. The Networkers are no longer used on this route as the Class 466s are now non-compliant with the new PRM-TSI law and the volume of traffic cannot support Class 465s or 4-car Class 375s/377s Electrostars
* Strood – Maidstone West/Paddock Wood/Tonbridge

===Sheerness line===
From December 2019, Class 375/3 units replaced Class 466 units on the Sheerness line due to the latter being non-compliant with the new PRM-TSI law.

<doc id="1112803" wikidata="Q2092598" url="?curid=1112803" title="Piel Island">
<text>Piel Island lies in Morecambe Bay, around off the southern tip of the Furness peninsula in the administrative county of Cumbria, England. It is one of the Islands of Furness, three of which sit near to Piel at the mouth of Walney Channel. The island is the location of Piel Castle, built by the monks of Furness Abbey in the fourteenth century.

Historically within Lancashire, the island today is owned by the town of Barrow-in-Furness, having been given to the people by the Duke of Buccleuch in 1922. The council&#x27;s administrative duties also include the selection of the &quot;King&quot; of Piel, who is the landlord of the island&#x27;s public house, the Ship Inn. Piel is about in size. The landlord and their family and three others who live in the old Ship&#x27;s pilots&#x27; cottages are the island&#x27;s only permanent residents.

==History==
In the Middle Ages Piel was known as Fowdray (or Fouldrey or Fowdrey) island. This name would seem to be derived from the Old Norse words &#x27;, meaning &quot;fodder&quot;, and &#x27; or &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;island&quot;. The island was part of the Liberty of Furness, granted in 1066 to Earl Tostig, and 1127 it formed part of the Liberty that was granted by King Stephen to the Savignac monks as part of a land grant for an abbey. When the Savignacs became part of the Cistercian order later in the 12th century, the island came under the control of the Cistercians at nearby Furness Abbey. The Cistercians increased their power, and soon controlled the whole of the Furness, including Piel. In the early 13th century the Cistercians used Piel as a safe harbour and built a warehouse for the storage of grain, wine and wool. Some of these commodities were shipped over from Ireland. In 1212 the monks were granted a licence by King John to land one cargo of &quot;wheat, flour and other provisions&quot; to stave off a famine caused by the failure of the local harvest. Later in the century an unlimited cargo licence was granted and in 1258 ships owned by the abbey were placed under royal protection.

The monks fortified the island, firstly with a wooden tower surrounded by a ditch with palisades, and then in 1327 they commenced the building of a motte and bailey fort (also known as a &quot;peel&quot;hence the island&#x27;s modern name). This structure was, at the time, the largest of its kind in northwest England. It was probably built as a fortified warehouse to repel pirates and raiders, but it would appear to have had a measure of success in keeping the customs men at bay as well; smuggling was widespread at the time and the abbey was known to have been involved. Indeed, in 1423 an accusation was made against the Abbott of Furness that he smuggled wool out of the country from &quot;la Peele de Foddray&quot;. The red sandstone ruins of the fort came to be known as the &quot;Pile of Fouldrey&quot;, and are known today as Piel Castle.

The next noteworthy episode in the island&#x27;s history occurred on 4 June 1487 when Lambert Simnel and his supporters arrived from Dublin. Simnel, crowned as &quot;Edward VI&quot; in Ireland, was being passed off as Edward, 17th Earl of Warwick, the Yorkist heir, by John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in his attempt to regain the throne for the Yorkists. Simnel and 2,000 German mercenaries made their way via Piel to do battle for the throne. They were eventually defeated at the Battle of Stoke near Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire on 16 June 1487.
Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537 Piel Island and its castle became the property of the king. The castle&#x27;s fortifications were strengthened at the time of the Spanish Armada but from then until the Civil War nothing of note happened on the island.
The area of Furness was a Parliamentarian stronghold during the Civil War. For this reason the Parliamentarian fleet retreated to Piel Harbour when the Royalists captured Liverpool.

In 1662, following the restoration of Charles II, the lordship of Furness was given to the Duke of Albemarle and this included the castle and parts of the island. After this date activity on Piel seems to have revolved around shipping and industry. A salt works is recorded as existing on the island from as early as 1662, which was still apparently present in the 1690s.

Piel Island became an important trading post during the 18th century and customs men were permanently stationed there; smuggling was still rife at the time. In the second half of the 18th century the iron ore trade began to develop on the Furness Peninsula and the harbour continued to be important to the local economy. As the volume of shipping increased &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s boatmen&quot; were stationed on Piel as harbour pilots and customs inspectors. In formal terms, it was a creek (outstation) of the port of Lancaster, and known as Piel Foudray. The impact of industry was relatively low on the appearance of the island, however, and in the 19th century the ruins of the castle became a major attraction to the romanticist art movement. The island was painted in 1805 by Sir George Beaumont, a painting which inspired William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Elegiac Stanzas&quot;, based also on his own time living at Rampside with a view out to Piel.

The ownership of Piel Island eventually descended to the Duke of Buccleuch. The 5th Duke heavily developed industry around Furness, and in 1875 had the fishermen&#x27;s cottages built on the island. The 7th Duke later donated the island to the people of Barrow-in-Furness in 1920 as a World War I memorial.

==Today==

Being separated from neighbouring Roa Island by the Piel Channel, the island is accessible via a ferryboat from Roa Island pier during summer and subject to the tides and weather. Piel can be reached on foot or by off-road vehicle (licenses are required to drive on the sands) from Walney Island, but this route is only passable with care at low tide; local guidance is recommended. Piel Castle is managed by English Heritage and there is free, unlimited access once on the island. The castle, located on the southeast tip of Piel Island, is an impressive ruin made up largely of stones from the beach. The three-storey keep affords good views of the island although it is no longer accessible to visitors. Campers may pitch a tent on the island.

The island is a haven for wildlife with many different species of sea bird to be found. Visitors should take care not to disturb nesting birds while walking on the beach. A marsh pond in the centre of the island now attracts many other types of bird.

==The Ship Inn==
The origins of the Ship Inn are obscure; it is said to be over 300 years old, but the evidence is uncertain. In 1746 a lease for agricultural land situated within the castle ditch was granted to an Edward Postlethwaite, who is described as an innkeeper from the &#x27;Pile of Fowdrey&#x27;. The earliest direct reference to an inn, or &#x27;publick house&#x27;, is in 1800. In 1813 a visitor painted a vivid picture of the life of the innkeeper at that time:

The earliest map reference, in 1833, refers to the inn as &#x27;The Herdhouse&#x27;, and the first person who can confidently be identified as a landlord of the Ship Inn is James Hool as he is listed in the 1841 census as a publican.

The landlord of the Ship Inn pub is known as &#x27;The King of Piel&#x27;, a title instituted in the 19th century and harking back to Lambert Simnel and his attempt to usurp the English throne. A tradition handed down by fishermen for centuries is the &#x27;Knighthood of Piel&#x27;. In a room of the inn is a large oak chair and anyone who sits in it is made a &#x27;Knight of Piel&#x27;. The ceremonial knighting is carried out by the King of Piel or a fellow knight. The present-day cost of becoming a knight is to buy a round of drinks for all those present. However, the privilege afforded to knights is that they may demand food and lodging of the innkeeper should they be shipwrecked on Piel.

The longest recorded serving landlords were Thomas and Elizabeth Ashburner, c.1894-c.1922, and the 20-year licence of Rod and Karen Scarr which ended in November 2005 is the second-longest recorded. Following their departure in 2006 the pub was fully renovated by Barrow Borough Council, with work beginning in 2008, shortly before the new &#x27;King of Piel&#x27;, Steve Chattaway, was crowned (an event that was documented in the TV series &quot;Islands of Britain&quot;). The Chattaways left in 2020, with the new landlord Aaron Sanderson moving in in May 2022.

<text>SUDAAN (an acronym for &quot;Survey Data Analysis&quot;) is a proprietary statistical software package for the analysis of correlated data, including correlated data encountered in complex sample surveys. SUDAAN originated in 1972 at RTI International (the trade name of Research Triangle Institute). Individual commercial licenses are sold for $1,460 a year, or $3,450 permanently.

==Current version==
SUDAAN Release 11.0.3, released in May 2018, is a single program consisting of a family of thirteen analytic procedures used to analyze data from complex sample surveys and other observational and experimental studies involving repeated measures and cluster-correlated data. It provides estimates that account for complex design features of a study, including:

* unequally weighted or unweighted data
* stratification
* with- or without-replacement designs
* multistage and cluster designs
* repeated measures
* general cluster-correlation (e.g., correlation due to multiple measures taken from patients)
* multiply imputed analysis variables

==Example fields of use==
SUDAAN enables the analysis of correlated data encountered in various fields of statistical research, including: 
* survey research (RDD/telephone studies, area sample designs, cluster and stratified designs, list sampling)
* clinical trials (safety and efficacy data from multiple sites in multisite trials) 
* group or community randomized trials 
* observations on related family members 
* toxicology (observations on littermates) 
* multiple subjects within a cluster (patients within physician clinics or students within school classrooms) 
* social statistics 
* health outcomes research 
* longitudinal data analyses 
* repeated measures.

==Strengths==
SUDAAN&#x27;s strength lies in its ability to compute standard errors of ratio estimates, means, totals, regression coefficients, and other statistics in accordance with the sample design, greatly increasing the accuracy and validity of results. Many, if not most, data sets require attention to correlation and weighting, but few statistical software packages offer the user the opportunity to specify how data are correlated and weighted. For many years, SUDAAN remained the only broadly applicable software for analysis of correlated and weighted data. Currently Mplus offers similar capacities for a much broader set of models.

Currently, all nine of SUDAAN&#x27;s analytic procedures offer three popular robust variance estimation methods:
* Taylor series linearization (generalized estimation equations [GEE] for regression models)
* jackknife (with or without user-specified replicate weights)
* balance repeated replication (BRR).
SUDAAN code is similar to SAS. Although more powerful than other statistical software, SUDAAN has a steep learning curve.

==Operating systems==
SUDAAN functions on many computing platforms—including Windows 7/10, DOS, and LINUX—either as a stand-alone statistical software tool, or in SAS-callable format (SAS Version 9).

<text>Ubayd Allah (), known as Abu Marwan (), was a general in the service of Emir Abd ar-Rahman II of Córdoba. He was an uncle of the Emir Al-Hakam I. 

In 826, Aissó revolted and requested help from Abd ar-Rahman, who sent the general Abu Marwan. The army arrived in Zaragoza in May 827. From there Aby Marwan&#x27;s forces passed into territory of the county of Barcelona, reaching Barcelona in the summer. It besieged Barcelona without success, ransacking the city&#x27;s environs. Abu Marwan then moved on to Girona, which he attempted to occupy on October 10, 827. The Emperor Louis the Pious, knowing of the Muslim raid, ordered his son Pepin I of Aquitaine and the counts Hugh of Tours and Matfrid of Orléans to recruit an army, but the recruitment was slow and by the time it was formed, Abu Marwan and his army had returned to Muslim territory. The rebels abandoned the country with them (827).

<doc id="1112820" wikidata="Q2295649" url="?curid=1112820" title="Typhlosion">
<text>Typhlosion (), known in Japan as is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise, and the final evolved form of starter Pokémon Cyndaquil. First introduced in the video games &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, it was designed by Ken Sugimori and is featured in &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as various merchandise.

Classified as a Fire-type Pokémon, it has yellow and blue fur, and is able to generate flames from its back. In &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot;, Typhlosion receives a new regional variant called Hisuian Typhlosion, with Cyndaquil being one of three starter Pokémon in that game. In addition to its Fire typing, it also gains the Ghost typing.

The Hisuian variant of Typhlosion has generally been well received, with praise given to its design and discussion had over the gender presentation of this form. Typhlosion became the subject of discussion due to a leak of details of various &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, including one that explored lore about Typhlosion. Due to a inaccurate machine translation of this document, it was believed that this folklore depicted Typhlosion manipulating and impregnating a girl, though this was disputed by people claiming that the machine translation changed details.

==Conception and development==
Typhlosion is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Typhlosion was first introduced in &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;. It was visually based on a honey badger. When developing the games, around 300 individual Pokémon designs were drafted by various members of the development team, with each deciding their names and features, revising the drafts as needed. During this process the team actively tried to avoid vague design concepts, as they felt this had caused difficulty in creating completed Pokémon during &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; development. As the team selected which Pokémon would be included, they were drawn and finalized by lead artist Ken Sugimori. To maintain balance however, many of the newer species did not appear in the early stages of the game. Additionally, many of the Pokémon were designed with merchandise in mind, taking into account the related &quot;Pokémon&quot; toy line and anime series. As a result designs often had to be kept simplistic, something that caused strain for Sugimori and affected his approach to the next &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise titles, &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;.

Typhlosion is the final form of the Cyndaquil evolutionary line, evolving from the second stage, Quilava. It is a Fire-type Pokémon featuring yellow and blue fur and flames that come from its neck. &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot; features a new version of Typhlosion as part of regional forms called &quot;Hisuian,&quot; while Cyndaquil and Quilava retain their normal forms. It remains a Fire-type Pokémon, but gains the secondary typing of Ghost. It greatly resembles regular Typhlosion, though its flames take on a different appearance from the standard form.

==Appearances==
Typhlosion made its debut in the games &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; as the evolved form of Cyndaquil. Cyndaquil is made available to the player near the beginning of the game as their starter Pokémon alongside the Grass-type Chikorita and Water-type Totodile. It appears in the same role in the later version &quot;Pokémon Crystal&quot; and remakes &quot;HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot;. It later appeared in &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot;, with a new form of the species, named Hisuian Typhlosion, appearing. It can be traded to &quot;Pokémon Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot; from &quot;Arceus&quot;, via the game &quot;Pokémon Home&quot; and the original Typhlosion form can be obtained in &quot;The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero&quot;, the downloadable content for &quot;Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot;. Typhlosion appears in spinoffs of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, including &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, and the physical &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Typhlosion was covered in &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Pokémon of the Day&quot; series, with the author arguing that it had a difficult time living up to Charizard due to Charizard being among the most popular Pokémon. She believed that it was the strongest of the second generation&#x27;s starter Pokémon, stating that this as well as its &quot;explosive&quot; personality helped elevate its popularity. &quot;IGN&quot; writer Lucas M. Thomas felt that Typhlosion succeeded at following up Charizard as a Fire-type starter Pokémon. &quot;ITMedia&quot; staff praised Typhlosion&#x27;s design, particularly the flames that emit from its neck, and expressed their disappointment with it not having its flames out at all times, making it look worse.

Following an information leak, Typhlosion became the subject of discussion, as well as an internet meme, due to a scrapped design document detailing the folklore of its relationship with a human. This document was machine translated into English, where it appeared that Typhlosion married a human girl, presumed by some to be a child, and had a child with her. This led to Typhlosion receiving negative reactions on social media. After this document was leaked, it was reported that the machine translation was inaccurate, with claims made that the machine-translated version lacked context, particularly regarding the real-world folklore inspirations. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; writer Catherine Lewis stated that Typhlosion in this story may be based on the shapeshifting yokai Mujina. Lewis noted that whether the translation was accurate or not, being an internal document suggested it was not canon. &quot;Polygon&quot; writer Ana Diaz felt that it was similar to one of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot; or mythology, and added that it was often compared to Pokémon like Gardevoir and Vaporeon due to the sexual nature of the story. &quot;Vice&quot; writer Luis Prada felt that people overreacted to the leaked story, arguing that these kinds of stories are present in mythology both in and outside of Japan, as well as arguing that &quot;Pokémon&quot; has always dabbled in mythological inspiration. &quot;Daily Dot&quot; writer Lindsey Weedston agreed, adding that feelings on consent differed in the time these kinds of stories appeared than they do now.

Typhlosion&#x27;s Hisuian form has received generally positive reception. According to &quot;Inside Games&quot;, Hisuian Typhlosion&#x27;s design became popular among fans, though &quot;Screen Rant&quot; writer Austin King stated that initial impressions were mixed before people saw it with its flames on display, at which point reception became more positive. &quot;Paste&quot; writer Hana Kim called its design &quot;fantastic,&quot; and stated that its &quot;very calm demeanor&quot; and &quot;gentle and pacifist&quot; nature was a direct contrast to Typhlosion&#x27;s &quot;stoic, angry, and explosive&quot; personality. &quot;Game Rant&quot; writer Joseph Gobran expressed disappointment with Hisuian Typhlosion, stating that both it and its other form have abilities that are &quot;circumstantial,&quot; with Hisuian Typhlosion&#x27;s ability, Frisk, being useless in a competitive scene with the standard being both sides are able to see everything about their opponents team.

The design differences between Hisuian and the original form were the subject of discussion by critics. &quot;Inside Games&quot; writer Sawadee Otsuka felt that it had a more feminine design compared to its regular form, citing &quot;shadow-like eyelids&quot; and a &quot;listless appearance&quot; that they felt made it look seductive. They also discussed how a male Hisuian Typhlosion would be seen as a &quot;downer guy&quot; while a female would be seen as a &quot;seductive mature woman.&quot; Fellow &quot;Inside Games&quot; writer Hachiwatawachi discussed Hisuian Typhlosion&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Pokémon Cafe Mix&quot;, where it is seen wearing a kimono. She believed that male Typhlosion were seen as &quot;cool, handsome men with long, sharp features&quot; while females were perceived as &quot;sexy older sisters.&quot; On this design, she believed it felt more &quot;bright, cute, [and] innocent.&quot; Author Norihito Kodota analyzed Hisuian Typhlosion through a queer lens, arguing that its hunched walking style, eyeshadow, and the flames around its neck defied the ability to define Typhlosion in a way that neatly fits into male or female.

<text>Random early detection (RED), also known as random early discard or random early drop, is a queuing discipline for a network scheduler suited for congestion avoidance.

In the conventional tail drop algorithm, a router or other network component buffers as many packets as it can, and simply drops the ones it cannot buffer. If buffers are constantly full, the network is congested. Tail drop distributes buffer space unfairly among traffic flows. Tail drop can also lead to TCP global synchronization as all TCP connections &quot;hold back&quot; simultaneously, and then step forward simultaneously. Networks become under-utilized and flooded—alternately, in waves. 

RED addresses these issues by pre-emptively dropping packets before the buffer becomes completely full. It uses predictive models to decide which packets to drop. It was invented in the early 1990s by Sally Floyd and Van Jacobson.

== Operation ==
RED monitors the average queue size and drops (or marks when used in conjunction with ECN) packets based on statistical probabilities. If the buffer is almost empty, then all incoming packets are accepted. As the queue grows, the probability for dropping an incoming packet grows too. When the buffer is full, the probability has reached 1 and all incoming packets are dropped.

RED is more fair than tail drop, in the sense that it does not possess a bias against bursty traffic that uses only a small portion of the bandwidth. The more a host transmits, the more likely it is that its packets are dropped as the probability of a host&#x27;s packet being dropped is proportional to the amount of data it has in a queue. Early detection helps avoid TCP global synchronization.

== Problems with classic RED ==
According to Van Jacobson, &quot;there are not one, but two bugs in classic RED.&quot; Improvements to the algorithm were developed, and a draft paper was prepared, but the paper was never published, and the improvements were not widely disseminated or implemented. There has been some work in trying to finish off the research and fix the bugs.

Pure RED does not accommodate quality of service (QoS) differentiation. Weighted RED (WRED) and RED with In and Out (RIO) provide early detection with QoS considerations.

== Other variants ==

===WRED===
In weighted RED you can have different probabilities for different priorities (IP precedence, DSCP) and/or queues.

===ARED===
The adaptive RED or active RED (ARED) algorithm infers whether to make RED more or less aggressive based on the observation of the average queue length. If the average queue length oscillates around &quot;min&quot; threshold then early detection is too aggressive. On the other hand, if the average queue length oscillates around &quot;max&quot; threshold then early detection is being too conservative. The algorithm changes the probability according to how aggressively it senses it has been discarding traffic.

See Srikant for an in-depth account on these techniques and their analysis.

===RRED===
Robust random early detection (RRED) algorithm was proposed to improve the TCP throughput against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, particularly Low-rate Denial-of-Service (LDoS) attacks. Experiments have confirmed that the existing RED-like algorithms are notably vulnerable under Low-rate Denial-of-Service (LDoS) attacks due to the oscillating TCP queue size caused by the attacks. RRED algorithm can significantly improve the performance of TCP under Low-rate Denial-of-Service attacks.

<doc id="1112830" wikidata="Q1503069" url="?curid=1112830" title="Touriga Nacional">
<text>Touriga Nacional is a variety of red wine grape, considered by many to be Portugal&#x27;s finest. Despite the low yields from its small grapes, it plays a big part in the blends used for ports, and is increasingly being used for table wine in the Douro and Dão. Touriga Nacional provides structure and body to wine, with high tannins and concentrated flavors of black fruit. Jancis Robinson has compared its relationship with Touriga Francesa to the partnership between Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, the former providing structure, the latter filling out the bouquet.

==Viticulture==
The vine is very vigorous, and good results depend on keeping it in check. In the Douro it is grown in searing heat in steep schisty vineyards that are more rock than soil. The alternative name of Mortágua pays tribute to these harsh conditions. It is usually trained under one of the Guyot systems, and needs severe pruning to keep it under control. In contrast, the vine produces just a few bunches of blue-black grapes which vary in size from &#x27;small&#x27; to &#x27;tiny&#x27;. Thus yields are among the lowest of any commercial grape variety. In recent years, scientists have been working on cloning the Touriga Nacional to produce vines that are able to pollinate better with the goal of increasing yields by 15% and sugar content by 10%.

==Wine regions==

In the late 1990s there were of Touriga Nacional in Portugal. Its poor yields mean that it represents a tiny part of the wine production in the Douro, but it plays a major part in the blends of the best ports.

Traditionally a lot of US wine made from Touriga Nacional was fortified, and many of the producers of such &#x27;port&#x27; have experimented with using Portuguese grapes as a way to improve their product. 553 tons of Touriga were crushed in the USA in 2006, up 26% on the previous year.

==Wines==
The tiny berries of Touriga Nacional have a high skin to pulp ratio which heightens the amount of extract in the wines. The grapes can produce intense, very aromatic wines with high tannin content.

==Synonyms==
Bical Tinto, Mortágua, Mortágua Preto, Preto Mortágua, Touriga, Touriga Fina, Tourigao, Tourigo Antigo, Tourigo do Dão, and Turiga.

<text>Sanila (?800–834) was a Gothic magnate, lieutenant of the count Gaucelm of Rosselló, Empúries, Conflent and Rasez. What is known of his life is linked to &quot;Gaucelm&quot;. Sanila was his staunch lieutenant. The most notable surviving recorded incident about him was in 820, when Sanila beat the count Berà in a judicial duel (see Berà), which resulted in Berà losing his lands and being exiled, although Gaucelm did not immediately gain power over his estates as planned.

Gaucelm and Sanila defended Chalon-sur-Saône against the assault of Lothar in 834. The city was taken and Gaucelm and Sanila were captured and executed.

<text>Riverdale is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Gratiot County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population of the CDP was 281 at the 2020 census. The community is located within Seville Township with a small portion extending south into Sumner Township.

As an unincorporated community, Riverdale has no legal autonomy of its own but does have its own post office with the 48877 ZIP Code.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP of Riverdale has a total area of , of which is land and (1.43%) is water.

Riverdale is centrally located in the state&#x27;s Lower Peninsula about south of the city of Mount Pleasant. 
The community is centered along North Lumberjack Road about south of M-46. The Pine River flows through the community. Other nearby unincorporated communities include Elm Hall just to the south, Vestaburg to the west, and Elwell to the east. The cities of Alma and St. Louis are located further east.

The Riverdale post office uses the 48877 ZIP Code. The post office serves the western portion of Seville Township, as well the northwestern portion of Sumner Township. In Montcalm County, the post office serves the eastern portions of Richland Township and Ferris Township, as well as a small portion of the southeast corner of Fremont Township in Isabella County. The post office is located at 6728 North Lumberjack Road in the center of the community.

The Fred Meijer Heartland Trail, which travels from Alma to Greenville, has a trailhead in Riverdale.

==History==

The area was first settled by Arthur Newton in 1874, and he platted the community the following year. The community received a station along the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad, which later became part of the Pere Marquette Railway. Nelson also became the first postmaster when a post office opened on March 10, 1876. He wanted the post office to be named Riverside, as it was located along the Pine River. However, there was already another Riverside post office in operation in Berrien County. His post office and community would instead be named Riverdale. The post office has remained in continuous operation and is located at 6728 North Lumberjack Road in the center of the community.

The railroad was eventually discontinued, and the station and railway lines were removed entirely. In 1994, the former pathway of the railway lines was transformed into the Fred Meijer Heartland Trail, which was completed by 2015.

Among the oldest buildings and remaining businesses in the community is the Riverdale Tavern, which has been in operation since 1917. In 1895, Charles Green opened a saloon and restaurant in Riverdale. In 1912, he also added a grocery store and ice cream parlor to his business, but it burned down in 1917. On the same concrete slab of his former business, he rebuilt and established the Riverdale Tavern that same year. During the Prohibition Era, the building again transformed back to a grocery store and ice cream parlor. Green died in 1962, and the business transitioned through many owners. In 2017, the Riverdale Tavern celebrated its centennial anniversary.

For the 2020 census, Riverdale was included as a newly-listed census-designated place. Riverdale continues to remain an unincorporated community with no legal autonomy of its own.

==Demographics==
==Education==
The community of Riverdale is served by Alma Public Schools to the east in the city of Alma. The Seville Township Library is located in the center of the community at 6734 North Lumberjack Road right next door to the post office.

<doc id="1112848" wikidata="Q11695544" url="?curid=1112848" title="News Chronicle">
<text>The News Chronicle was a British daily newspaper. Formed by the merger of &quot;The Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; in 1930, it ceased publication on 17 October 1960, being absorbed into the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Its offices were at 12/22, Bouverie Street, off Fleet Street, London, EC4Y 8DP, England.

==&quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;==

The &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; was founded in 1872. Purchased by Edward Lloyd for £30,000 in 1876, it achieved a high reputation under the editorship of Henry Massingham and Robert Donald, who took charge in 1904.

Owned by the Cadbury family, with Laurence Cadbury as chairman, the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; was formed by the merger of the &quot;Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; on 2 June 1930, with Walter Layton appointed as editorial director.

==Politics==

With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the paper took an anti-Franco stance and sent three correspondents to Spain in 1936-37: Denis Weaver, who was captured and nearly shot before being released; Arthur Koestler (to Málaga); and, later, Geoffrey Cox (to Madrid). The paper&#x27;s editorial staff took an active part in campaigning for the release of Koestler, who was captured by Franco&#x27;s forces at the fall of Málaga and was in imminent danger of being executed.

Following Koestler&#x27;s release, the paper sent him to Mandatory Palestine, then convulsed by the Arab revolt. In a series of articles in the paper, Koestler urged adoption of the Peel Commission&#x27;s recommendation for partition of Palestine, as &quot;the only practical way of ending the bloodshed&quot;. In his autobiography Koestler notes that en route to Palestine he had stopped in Athens and had clandestine meetings with Communists and Liberals opposing the then Metaxas dictatorship, but the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; refused to publish his resulting strongly worded anti-Metaxas articles.

In 1956, the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; opposed the UK&#x27;s military support of Israel in invading the Suez canal zone, a decision which cost it circulation. According to Geoffrey Goodman, a journalist on the newspaper at the time, it was &quot;one of British journalism&#x27;s prime casualties of the Suez crisis&quot;.

==Folding==

On 17 October 1960, the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; &quot;finally folded, inappropriately, into the grip&quot; of the right-wing &quot;Daily Mail&quot; despite having a circulation of over a million. The &quot;News Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s editorial position was considered at the time to be in broad support of the British Liberal Party, in marked contrast to that of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. As part of the same takeover, the London evening paper &quot;The Star&quot; was incorporated into the &quot;Evening News&quot;.

<text>Drawn Together is an American adult animated sitcom created by Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein. It aired on Comedy Central from October 27, 2004, to November 14, 2007, for three seasons. The series is a parody of house-based reality shows, and follows the misadventures of the housemates in the fictional show of the same name. The series uses a sitcom format with a reality TV show setting.

&quot;Drawn Together&quot; uses caricatures of established cartoon characters and stock characters. These character traits parody personalities that are typically seen in reality television shows. Comedy Central advertised it as the first &quot;animated reality TV series&quot;, and in some episodes the characters participate in challenges that are similar to reality television challenges. This premise is largely dropped in later episodes.

The show was cancelled after three seasons. A direct-to-video film which serves as the show&#x27;s series finale, &quot;The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie!&quot;, was released on April 20, 2010.

==Cast and characters==
*Captain Leslie Hero (voiced by Jess Harnell): A sociopathic, chauvinistic, idiotic, perverted, heteroflexible, necrophiliac and lecherous parody of superheroes, with a visual style taken from the cartoons of Bruce Timm and Max Fleischer. Being primarily macho, he is prone to occasional random fits of hysterics, akin to post-traumatic stress disorder, playing on the &quot;tragic origin&quot; stories of many superheroes. His character is based on the &quot;flying brick&quot; superhero archetype, especially DC Comics&#x27; Superman and Shazam, though he refers in one episode to his &quot;hero cave&quot;, an allusion to Batman&#x27;s Batcave.
*Wooldoor Jebediah Sockbat (voiced by James Arnold Taylor): A hyperactive, idiotic, gullible, bizarre children&#x27;s show character, in the mold of SpongeBob SquarePants and Stimpy, who displays many of the typical reality-defying behaviors of Roger Rabbit or &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters.
*Princess Clara (voiced by Tara Strong): A pampered and bigoted princess. A Christian, she is passionate about singing, but repeatedly demonstrates homophobic and racist behavior. She is a spoof of Disney Princesses such as Ariel from &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.
*Foxxy Love (voiced by Cree Summer): A sharp-tongued, promiscuous, mystery-solving musician, and a ghetto-spoof of both Hanna-Barbera Productions and Archie Comics of the 1970s such as the Mystery Inc. Gang and Valerie Brown from &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;.
*Toot Braunstein (voiced by Tara Strong): A fat, egotistical, alcoholic retro-style sex symbol who is a parody of Betty Boop. Toot demands to be the center of attention, cuts herself with razor blades, practices poor personal hygiene, eats excessively when depressed and often instigates conflict in the house.
*Xandir P. Wifflebottom (voiced by Jack Plotnick): A hypersensitive gay and effeminate spoof of young, blonde, and handsome swordsman protagonists from JRPGs, such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Boy in Monster Land&quot;.
*Spanky Ham (voiced by Adam Carolla): A horny, toilet-humored, obnoxious anthropomorphic pig and a parody of various Internet Flash animation characters, specifically from Newgrounds and Adult Swim; his likenesses were inspired by &quot;The Real World: San Francisco&quot; cast member David &quot;Puck&quot; Rainey.
*Ling-Ling (voiced by Abbey McBride): A psychopathic, homicidal, anime battle monster from somewhere in Asia who is a spoof of trading card or &quot;pocket-duel&quot; franchises such as &quot;Pokémon&quot; and &quot;Digimon&quot; (mainly Pikachu). He battles using various supernatural powers/abilities (represented in anime-like style) English subtitles are shown on-camera due to Ling-Ling speaking pseudo-Japanese gibberish (or &quot;Japorean&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Japanese&quot; and &quot;Korean&quot;, as McBride calls it).

==Production==
===Animation style===
The show&#x27;s visual style is that of digital ink-and-paint. The style was chosen both for the retro feel it gives the show and for the versatility and freedom it allows the animators, providing an environment in which it is possible to combine many different styles of animation. Another unique aspect of the show is that, where most cartoons present their characters, though animated, as real within the show&#x27;s world, the &quot;Drawn Together&quot; characters retain their identities as cartoon characters even within their animated world, and they acknowledge their status as animations. The show has cameo appearances by famous characters (or in some cases, clones to avoid infringing copyright) from all across the animated spectrum. In keeping with the various animation styles for the characters, Wooldoor and Toot have four fingers on each hand, whereas Clara, Foxxy, Hero and Xandir have five. In promotional artwork for the show, Toot and Wooldoor are drawn with the standard five fingers, but in the show itself they have four. Whereas most of the characters are drawn with black outlines, Clara and items belonging to her are drawn with soft edges, a reference to Disney animation techniques, which involve &quot;cleanup&quot; of any black outlines. Contrasting, Toot is drawn in the grainy, high-contrast monochrome of her era&#x27;s technology.

The show was made by Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, with much of the animation done at the studio&#x27;s facilities in South Korea. A gag in &quot;The Drawn Together Clip Show&quot; is that they show a list of all the Korean children who died animating the show.

The movie was produced by 6 Point Harness and done completely with Flash animation due to budget cuts.

===Cancellation===
A total of three seasons were produced. Season 3 began airing on October 5, 2006, and took a mid-season break which started on November 15, 2006. The second half of season three began airing on October 4, 2007.
In March 2007, it was announced that creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein had left Comedy Central, and later created &quot;DJ &amp; the Fro&quot; for their sister channel MTV in 2009, and eventually signed a two-year contract with 20th Century Fox Television to create new series and/or work on the studio&#x27;s existing shows.

The season three finale included multiple jokes about the show&#x27;s cancellation. &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed this episode as a series finale and described the episode as follows: &quot;The series wraps up with the housemates participating in a singing competition as they look back on their recent misadventures.&quot;

In March 2008, Tara Strong confirmed that the show had been cancelled, and the back of the third season DVDs box refers to it as the &quot;third and final season&quot;.

Since cancellation, the show has partial rotation late-nights, and airs uncensored on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Secret Stash&quot; and on Logo.

In response to the cancellation, the official page of &quot;Drawn Together&quot; in Myspace had suggested the fans call Comedy Central and convince them to make a new season.

==Content==

The plots and humor of &quot;Drawn Together&quot; are adult-oriented and laden with shock comedy. The humor is largely morbid and satirical in nature, its primary focus being the mockery of stereotypes and the casual exploration of taboo subject matter, such as masturbation, paraphilia, kink, homosexuality or gay marriage, abortion, rape, incest, pedophilia, menstruation, spousal abuse, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, antisemitism, necrophilia, terrorism, graphic violence and death. Episodes such as &quot;Gay Bash&quot; or &quot;A Very Special Drawn Together Afterschool Special&quot;, for example, feature the exploration of homosexuality as a central theme. Nearly all episodes feature at least one death, and several episodes feature characters going on killing sprees or perpetrating or becoming victims of mass murder, though the main characters subsequently returned alive and uninjured. The show breaks the fourth wall regularly; on one occasion, the show mocks Adam Carolla, the voice of Spanky Ham.

Despite the show&#x27;s overt and underlined sexuality, the characters&#x27; innocent and sensual sides are often the main driving force of the plot (alongside comedic non-sequitur moments intended to parody standard plot lines). This adds romantic comedy, melodrama, action film, war film, court drama and other genres to the pool of spoofing material. Sincere feelings the characters are forced to experience (and comic disregard thereof) seem to add integrity to the plot and imbue every episode with a genuine moral message, made more efficient by constant spoofing of moral message clichés like &quot;character X has learned a valuable lesson&quot;.
Comedy Central&#x27;s original tagline for the show was &quot;Find out what happens when cartoon characters stop being polite... and start making out in hot tubs&quot;, referring to Clara and Foxxy&#x27;s kiss in the pilot episode. The line is a parody of &quot;The Real World&quot;&#x27;s tagline, &quot;Find out what happens when people stop being polite... and start getting real.&quot; The aforementioned hot tub kiss is considered one of the show&#x27;s defining images; Comedy Central based nearly all of its first-season promotional material for &quot;Drawn Together&quot; on it. In &quot;The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie!&quot;, a billboard featuring the hot tub kiss is a major plot point in the film and is the main reason why the Network Head is hunting the housemates down in order to kill them in the movie, due to the billboard being the cause of his wife and daughter&#x27;s death.

The extensive use of stereotypes is another controversial aspect of the show, though the intent is actually to make fun of bigotry. As Jess Harnell states in the DVD commentary for &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, &quot;Most of the racism on the show is coming from people who are so obviously stupid about it; it really isn&#x27;t that threatening&quot;. (Jewish people are mocked, including creators and principal cast member Tara Strong.) Other content known to be featured on some episodes are occurrences of natural disasters, depictions of dictators and sexual fetishes.
&quot;Drawn Together&quot; is heavy with popular culture references. Animation is a major source of material; as mentioned above, many characters from comics and animated cartoons make cameo appearances and often are the subjects of parody. Numerous live-action films, TV shows, and video games are referenced as well. Reality shows are another prime inspiration, not surprising given that &quot;Drawn Together&quot; is presented as a reality show that takes place in a cartoon world. Although many of the first-season plots made extensive use of the reality show scenario, this aspect of the show has largely been de-emphasized in later episodes. The spoofing of film and television clichés is another common theme on the show; many &quot;Drawn Together&quot; stories are parodies of overused plots from TV and films.

One notable factor of the series are musical numbers. Some are parodies of real songs (i.e. in &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, the song &quot;Black Chick&#x27;s Tongue&quot; is a parody of &quot;A Whole New World&quot; from &quot;Aladdin&quot;; in the episode &quot;Super Nanny&quot;, the song at the DMV is a riff on &quot;Who&#x27;s That Guy?&quot; from &quot;Grease 2&quot;; in &quot;Freaks &amp; Greeks&quot;, the song at the end is a take on &quot;Summer Nights&quot; from &quot;Grease&quot;; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Really Love Being Abandoned Here&quot; in &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s That Ends Well&quot; is a reference to &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Gonna Like It Here&quot; from &quot;Annie&quot;). Other songs are those written by the show&#x27;s creators/writers, like &quot;The Bully Song&quot; from &quot;Requiem for a Reality Show&quot; and &quot;La-La-La-La-Labia&quot; in &quot;Clara&#x27;s Dirty Little Secret&quot;). Only two episodes (&quot;Lost in Parking Space, Part One&quot; and &quot;Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care&quot;) do not feature a musical performance.

In terms of continuity, events in different episodes contradict each other, as there is a loose sense of canon. One such example is in &quot;The Other Cousin&quot; and &quot;N.R.A.y RAY&quot;, in which Toot is pictured with a penis, something that is not consistent with other episodes. Another is Foxxy&#x27;s various and contradictory stories about her son Timmy (one involves selling him on the black market, another involves her accidentally shooting him after believing him to be rabid, when he was really just brushing his teeth). Plots and gags are often used that do not make any type of internal sense, but are used as one-off jokes, as when Foxxy, who is in her twenties, is said to have a teenage grandson. Some episodes begin with a fake recap of events supposed to have happened in a (non-existent) previous episode. According to executive producer Bill Freiberger, &quot;Very little on &quot;Drawn Together&quot; can be considered canon. If you try to find continuity on this show you&#x27;ll drive yourself nuts. The only thing that&#x27;s consistent is we try to make the show as funny as possible. And we&#x27;d never let a little thing like continuity get in the way of that.&quot;

Occasionally, episodes of &quot;Drawn Together&quot; are shown with less editing for content during &quot;Secret Stash&quot;, a Comedy Central program aired on weekends at 1am that showcases films (i.e. &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;), comedy specials (Comedy Central Roast), and animated programs (this and &quot;South Park&quot;) with uncensored language. Though &quot;Secret Stash&quot; programs typically have the nudity still censored, &quot;Drawn Together&quot; is an exception to this. Some nudity not seen in the original broadcast is shown in the &quot;Secret Stash&quot; version, while the nudity in other scenes is censored with a caption reading &quot;DVD only&quot;; this is done as a way of promoting the show&#x27;s DVD releases.

==Voice cast==
&quot;Drawn Together&quot; features an ensemble cast of veteran voice actors (Tara Strong, Cree Summer, Jess Harnell, Adam Carolla, and James Arnold Taylor) and newcomers to the field (Abbey McBride and Jack Plotnick).

Three of the show&#x27;s voice actors had worked with creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein on other projects: Jack Plotnick on &quot;Action&quot;, and Adam Carolla and Abbey McBride on &quot;The Man Show&quot;. Two of &quot;Drawn Together&quot;&#x27;s guest stars also came from the casts of earlier Jeser/Silverstein projects: &quot;The Other Cousin&quot; guest star Sarah Silverman (from &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot;), and Carolla&#x27;s &quot;Man Show&quot; co-host Jimmy Kimmel, who guest-starred in &quot;Xandir and Tim, Sitting in a Tree&quot; and &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s That Ends Well&quot;.

Tara Strong and James Arnold Taylor had previously worked together on the animated series &quot;Mutant League&quot; and the video game &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; where they voiced the characters of Thrasher and Rikku (Strong) and Cannonball and Tidus (Taylor) respectively.

Principal cast member Tara Strong has stated that she deeply loves the show, as it was such a departure from the family-friendly productions that she was used to working on at the time. The only problems that she had with it were a few jokes related to Anne Frank.

Originally, Xandir was to have been played by Nat Faxon, but he was fired following the first table read because the network felt his portrayal of the character was too stereotypically gay. Actor Jack Plotnick ended up being cast because he could play a gay man without resorting to stereotypical mannerisms such as the gay lisp.

In addition to their regular roles, the show&#x27;s cast provides many of the minor roles and guest voices on the series, Summer, Strong, Harnell and Taylor in particular. In the DVD commentary for &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, Tara Strong jokes that this is because the show does not have a lot of money to pay guest stars. Chris Edgerly appears in the majority of season one and two episodes despite not having a regular role on the series.

==Critical reception==
The pilot episode, &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, was given mediocre reviews, which focused mostly on its crudity. &quot;USA Today&quot; deemed &quot;Drawn Together&quot; &quot;the smutty offspring of &quot;Real World&quot; and &quot;Superfriends&quot;&quot;, stating that the pilot pushed the limits of taste, being overpowered by violence, sex, and disgusting subject matter. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, while it had many good sight gags, did not go far enough in parodying reality television. The domination of Clara&#x27;s racism in the story was criticized as being a weak attempt to &quot;send up racism while still showcasing its cruel excitement&quot;. Toot&#x27;s cutting was praised as a good parody of self-harm presented on reality shows, but Spanky&#x27;s flatulence was considered more disgusting than humorous.

The pilot episode was given an F rating from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, leading to the second-season episode &quot;Xandir and Tim, Sitting in a Tree&quot; having a subplot in which the majority of the housemates seek revenge for the rating. The latter episode also received an F from the magazine. Some reviewers called &quot;Drawn Together&quot; a &quot;bizarre and highly entertaining series&quot; which has a unique style of humor and &quot;level of self-parody.&quot;

Despite this, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named &quot;Drawn Together&quot; in its 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time list in 2013.

==Episodes==

==Distribution==
===Syndication and streaming===
The series previously aired on Logo TV with episodes uncensored.

In May 2019, the series began streaming on the Viacom owned streaming platform, Pluto TV on the Comedy Central Pluto TV channel. The entire series was added to CBS All Access&#x27;s (now Paramount+) roster in July 2020 among other Paramount Global properties.

===Home releases===
Season releases

The first season of &quot;Drawn Together&quot; was released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment on October 4, 2005. Its release was timed to coincide to be the same month as the premiere of Season Two on television on October 19, 2005. The set includes all seven aired first-season episodes. (By the time the release was finalized, it had been determined that the unaired &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; would air during Season Two, so it was left off the set and eventually released as part of the Season Two set.) The profanity and nudity are intact and uncensored. Some shows also contain additional lines and scenes. Special features include audio commentary on select episodes by creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein along with assorted cast and crew members, in addition to deleted scenes and karaoke/sing-along versions of the show&#x27;s songs.

The set has a game called the &quot;Censored/Uncensored&quot; game: A line is given, and the viewer must decide if the line aired on television as given (uncensored), or if it had to be altered significantly or deleted (censored). Some of the censored lines appear intact in the extended DVD version of the episode. Getting at least 11 of the 19 questions correct unlocks a hidden feature, a prank phone call by Jeser and Silverstein to their agent regarding the royalties they are to receive for the DVD audio commentaries.

The song &quot;Time of My Life&quot; from &quot;Dirty Pranking No. 2&quot; had to be left off the first season DVD because of copyright concerns. The show mocked the situation in the lyrics of the replacement music.

Season Two Uncensored was released on September 25, 2007. Like the Season One set, the set features audio commentaries by Jeser and Silverstein along with assorted cast and crew members, as well as karaoke/singalong versions of the show&#x27;s songs. The set also contains, in the words of the box art, &quot;potentially annoying&quot; commentary on the commentary for &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;. The behind-the-scenes interviews in the set are the same ones that appear on Comedy Central&#x27;s website, which feature each of the voice actors talking about his or her character, along with a separate interview with creators Jeser and Silverstein. Tara Strong does two separate interviews, one for each of her characters (Princess Clara and Toot Braunstein).

The set includes the controversial horse shot from &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, which was not allowed to air on television.

&quot;Season Three Uncensored&quot; was released on May 13, 2008.

The censored broadcast cuts of the episodes have never been made available on DVD or any other physical media, but they are available on Amazon.com&#x27;s streaming service, with the original music.

==Broadcast==
The show aired on Comedy Central for three seasons from October 27, 2004 to November 14, 2007.

<doc id="1112858" wikidata="Q1738779" url="?curid=1112858" title="Kenmore Square">
<text>Kenmore Square is a square in the Fenway–Kenmore neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It is formed by the crossing of Beacon Street, Commonwealth Avenue, and Brookline Avenue. It is the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 20, the longest U.S. Highway. The Citgo sign is a prominent landmark in Kenmore Square, and Fenway Park is just to the south. Kenmore station is located under the square, with a surface bus terminal inside the square.

==History==
In early Colonial times the land that is now Kenmore Square was an uninhabited corner of the mainland where the narrow Charles River fed into the wide, marshy Back Bay. It was part of the colonial settlement of Boston until 1705, when the hamlet of Muddy River incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The land ended up in Brookline because the Muddy River - several blocks to the east - formed the eastern border of the new city.

An 1821 map shows the area known as Sewell&#x27;s Point, with Great Dam, Brighton Road (Brighton Ave and Commonwealth Ave), and Punch Bowl Road (now Brookline Ave) intersecting at Sewell&#x27;s Point then connected to the mainland to the west, in addition to the southern connection shown in 1777.

The portion of Beacon Street west of Governor Square was laid out in 1850, intersecting with Avenue Street (now the Allston portion of Commonwealth Avenue), Mill Dam Road (now Brookline Avenue), and Western Avenue, a road traversing the Back Bay mill dam in approximately the modern location of Beacon Street. The Boston and Worcester Rail Road and the Charles River Branch Railroad combined here to cross the Back Bay on a separate railroad bridge, making a beeline for the Leather District. The railroad lines still exist on more or less their original alignments, with the city developing around them.

The town of Brighton was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline line was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. Even as late as 1880, Governor Square was only sparsely developed. By 1890, the Back Bay landfill project had reached the square, for the first time fully connecting it with parts of the city to the east.

Streetcar tracks were laid on Beacon Street in 1888, passing through Governor Square on the surface, from Coolidge Corner to Massachusetts Avenue. These would eventually become the Green Line C branch. Tracks were laid on what by then was called Commonwealth Avenue in 1896, from Union Square in Brighton. These would later serve the Green Line A branch and Green Line B branch. The Boylston Street subway was extended to just east of Kenmore Square in 1914. Streetcars crossed the busy square until 1932, when the underground Kenmore station opened along with a subway extension.

Governor Square was renamed Kenmore Square on December 31, 1931. The new name was taken from the streetcar stop, itself named for the short Kenmore Street. The park in the center of the square was replaced by a bus terminal in 1943.

In 1915, the Kenmore Apartments were built on the corner of Kenmore and Commonwealth Avenue. Later, the apartments became the Hotel Kenmore with 400 guest rooms. The Kenmore was owned by Bertram Druker, a prominent Boston developer and was known as the baseball hotel. It housed every one of the 14 out of town teams in Major League Baseball teams in the years following World War II. From the 1960s to 1979 it was used by Grahm Junior College as a residence hall, cafeteria, library, and classroom facility. Later, after Grahm Junior College closed and larger hotels like the Sheraton were built, the Hotel Kenmore started to show its age and eventually became apartments again. It is now called Kenmore Abbey.

<text>Sa&#x27;dun al-Ruayni () was Governor, or Wali, of Barcelona from 792 to 801 and the penultimate Muslim ruler of the city.

He was appointed successor to Matruh ben Sulayman al-Arabi in circa 792 by the Emir of Córdoba, Hisham. However, in 796 he led a revolt against the Emir; in April 797 he travelled to Aachen and offered Charlemagne the city&#x27;s loyalty in exchange for the empire&#x27;s help against Córdoba.

Charlemagne summoned an assembly in Toulouse in the spring of the 800 which agreed to send an expedition led by his son Louis the Pious to Barcelona. The army included several notable commanders including Rostany, Count of Girona; Ademar, Count of Narbonne; and William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse (cousin of Charlemagne). However, on arriving at Barcelona, Sa&#x27;dun, who had in the meantime been reconciled to the Caliphate, refused to open the city gates. The Frankish forces then began a long siege in the autumn of 800. Sa&#x27;dun attempted to escape in order to raise help from Córdoba, but was captured by the besieging army. He was replaced as governor by Harun of Barcelona, however the siege was successful and Harun surrendered the city and its starving population on Saturday, April 3, 801. Louis I entered the city on the following day (April 4, 801). Sa&#x27;dun was brought before Charlemagne in the summer of 801 and condemned to exile.

<doc id="1112869" wikidata="Q1533970" url="?curid=1112869" title="Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla">
<text>is a 1994 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Kensho Yamashita, with special effects by Kōichi Kawakita. Distributed by Toho and produced under their subsidiary Toho Pictures, it is the 21st film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, as well as the sixth film in the franchise&#x27;s Heisei series. The film is notable for the introduction of the monster SpaceGodzilla, as well as the re-introduction of the mecha character M.O.G.U.E.R.A.; its first appearance on-screen since the 1957 film &quot;The Mysterians&quot;.

&quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; stars Megumi Odaka, Jun Hashizume, Zenkichi Yoneyama, Akira Emoto, and Towako Yoshikawa, with Kenpachiro Satsuma as Godzilla. The film was released theatrically in Japan on December 10, 1994, and earned ¥1.65 billion in Japanese distributor rentals, it received mixed reviews from critics who praised the special effects and some battle scenes but criticized the storyline and pacing. &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; was released direct-to-video in the United States in 1999 by Columbia Tristar Home Video.

It was followed by &quot;Godzilla vs. Destoroyah&quot;, which serves as a finale to the Heisei Godzilla films, and was released on December 9, 1995.

==Plot==
Godzilla cells brought into space by Biollante, in 1990, and Mothra, in 1993, are exposed to intense radiation from a black hole, resulting in the birth of &quot;SpaceGodzilla&quot;, which quickly makes his way to Earth, destroying a NASA space station along the way.

Meanwhile, members of the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center arrive at Baas Island in order to plant a mind control device on Earth&#x27;s Godzilla. The Cosmos, Mothra&#x27;s twin priestesses, appear to psychic Miki Saegusa and warn her of SpaceGodzilla&#x27;s arrival. M.O.G.U.E.R.A. (Mobile Operations G-Force Universal Expert Robot: Aero-type), a mecha built by the JSDF to replace Mechagodzilla, sent in to intercept SpaceGodzilla, but suffers damage in the process.

SpaceGodzilla lands on Baas Island and attacks Little Godzilla with the Corona Beam. Godzilla intervenes but finds himself overwhelmed by SpaceGodzilla&#x27;s other abilities, and is powerless to stop the clone from trapping Little Godzilla in a crystal prison. SpaceGodzilla leaves for Japan, with Godzilla in pursuit.

Shortly thereafter, the yakuza abduct Miki and bring her back to their base in Fukuoka in an attempt to use her psychic abilities to gain control over Godzilla. Miki is saved by a rescue team before SpaceGodzilla arrives. SpaceGodzilla lands in central Fukuoka and forms a massive fortress of celestial crystals. M.O.G.U.E.R.A. arrives to once again fight SpaceGodzilla, but is still no match for it. Godzilla arrives in Kagoshima Bay and fights SpaceGodzilla, but SpaceGodzilla easily gains the upper hand.

The JSDF discovers that SpaceGodzilla is using Fukuoka Tower as a power converter, using it to transform the Earth&#x27;s core into an energy that SpaceGodzilla can absorb, slowly killing the planet through Earth&#x27;s volcanos. While Godzilla wrestles with SpaceGodzilla, M.O.G.U.E.R.A. splits into two different mechas: the Star Falcon, a flying battleship, and the Land M.O.G.U.E.R.A., a tank with a large drill in front of it. The mechas damage the crystal fortress while Godzilla pushes over Fukuoka Tower, cutting off SpaceGodzilla&#x27;s energy supply. M.O.G.U.E.R.A. quickly reforms and blasts off SpaceGodzilla&#x27;s crystal-like shoulder formations, weakening him. SpaceGodzilla then critically damages M.O.G.U.E.R.A. but is subsequently incinerated by Godzilla&#x27;s supercharged atomic heat ray. SpaceGodzilla is destroyed, but the JSDF claims that if they keep polluting space another SpaceGodzilla may appear someday.

Godzilla makes his way back to Baas Island after Miki uses her psychic powers to remove the mind control device from his neck. Godzilla turns to her and nods in gratitude. Little Godzilla is then freed from the crystal prison and begins blowing tiny radioactive bubbles.

==Cast==
==Production==

Although director Kensho Yamashita and screenwriter Hiroshi Kashiwabara had more experience in producing teen idol movies, they were not newcomers to the kaiju genre, having both assumed minor roles in the making of &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;. The two decided early in production to make the film more lighthearted than its predecessors and more focused on character development, centering it on Megumi Odaka&#x27;s recurring character Miki Saegusa, who had previously played marginal roles in the series. The emphasis on lightheartedness was such that a scene depicting Godzilla desperately trying to rescue his son from SpaceGodzilla&#x27;s crystal prison was deleted on account of its seriousness, a move disapproved of by Godzilla suit actor Kenpachiro Satsuma.

The idea of a &quot;Space Godzilla&quot; was first conceived in 1978, and was designed as a homage to the monster&#x27;s hinted progenitor Biollante by incorporating tusks and a hissing roar reminiscent of the latter monster. Creature designer Shinji Nishikawa had initially envisioned SpaceGodzilla as a much more western dragon-like creature with large fin-like wings on the back. The final design bore greater resemblance to Godzilla&#x27;s final form from the video game &quot;Super Godzilla&quot;, itself also designed by Nishikawa. Effects artist Koichi Kawakita redesigned Godzilla&#x27;s son as a more cartoonish-looking character, having disliked the more dinosaurian-looking version in &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II.&quot; It was rumoured that Kawakita intended to use the new design in a children&#x27;s spinoff TV special entitled &quot;Little Godzilla&#x27;s Underground Adventure&quot;. However, this was nothing more than a myth. The M.O.G.U.E.R.A. suit was worn by Mechagodzilla performer Wataru Fukuda, and consisted of three pieces applied separately. The new Godzilla suit used for the majority of the film combined aspects of the suits used in &quot;Godzilla vs. Biollante&quot;/&quot;Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah&quot; and &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot;, having a stocky, triangular build, wide shoulders and much less pronounced ribbing on the neck. The face bore similarities to those used in the previous two films, though the eyes were increased in size and given more prominent whites, thus making it relatively less menacing looking than its predecessors. Innovations included the head&#x27;s ability to fully rotate around the body, and the incorporation of an air duct which solved the chronic ventilation problems present in previous suits. The suit from &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; was reused for Godzilla&#x27;s entrance and exit from Birth Island and during the scene where he is telekinetically tossed by SpaceGodzilla. The scenes taking place on Birth Island were filmed on Okinoerabu-Shima Island. The actors were unable to return to Japan to film scenes in the studio after a storm suspended air traffic, so they needed to return via ferry so that the filming schedule would not be delayed.

Composer Akira Ifukube refused to be involved in the film after reading the script, which reminded him too much of a teen idol film and included rap music. The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Echoes of Love&quot;, was made by Fukuoka-based indietronica pop band Date of Birth.

&quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; is the second film to feature brief nudity (following &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;). This occurs when the character Akira Yuki is taking a shower on Birth Island in the evening and his buttocks are briefly seen.

==English version==
After the film was released in Japan, Toho commissioned a Hong Kong company to dub the film into English. In this international version of the movie, an English title card was superimposed over the Japanese title, as had been done with the previous 1990s Godzilla films.

Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; and &quot;Godzilla vs. Destoroyah&quot; on home video on January 19, 1999. This was the first time either film had been officially released in the United States. TriStar used the Toho dubs, but cut the end credits and created new titles and opening credits for both films. Toho&#x27;s complete international version of &quot;Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla&quot; (sans any onscreen text besides the English title) has been broadcast on several premium movie channels since the early 2000s, as well as the 2014 Blu-Ray release.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Released on December 10, 1994, the film sold tickets in Japan and earned ¥1,650,000,000 in Japanese distributor rentals. As the film&#x27;s release coincided with the Kobe earthquake, Toho feared that the event would put off audiences due to the film&#x27;s main battle sequence taking place in the same area, and thus sought to remedy this by lowering ticket prices.

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews. &quot;Monster Zero&quot; called the film &quot;a curiously uninvolving effort&quot; that &quot;disappoints in nearly all aspects of the production&quot;. &quot;American Kaiju&quot; criticized the &quot;wildly uneven pacing&quot;, &quot;uneven special effects&quot;, and &quot;exceedingly lumpy story&quot;, but added that &quot;most of the special effects are pretty fair&quot; and &quot;the monster battles are mostly fun.&quot; &quot;DVD Cult&quot; said, &quot;It does have some great destruction scenes and monster battles; two things that make these films worthwhile to begin with. The monster SpaceGodzilla is excellently designed, and is certainly far more menacing than anything Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich ever dreamed up.&quot; &quot;Toho Kingdom&quot; said the film is &quot;far from terrible&quot; and &quot;an underrated movie&quot; but felt it suffered from an &quot;overly complicated story&quot;, &quot;underdeveloped characters&quot;, and &quot;forgettable&quot; music. 

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 57% based on 7 reviews, with a rating average of 4.3/10.&quot;

<text>Harun of Barcelona () was the last &quot;Wali&quot; of Barcelona, ruling from 800 to 801, during the Siege of Barcelona.

A Muwallad Muslim of local Visigothic stock, Harun succeeded as Wali when his predecessor, Sa&#x27;dun al Ruayni was captured by besieging Frankish forces while trying to reach Córdoba to raise help. Harun was chosen as Wali by both the Gothic and Muslim population in the city. However totally besieged, with no food and no hope of help, the city&#x27;s Gothic magnates forced him to surrender Barcelona to the Frank Louis the Pious on April 3, 801.

The surrender meant the city passed from Muslim control into part of the &quot;Hispanic Marches&quot; of the Carolingian Empire and Bera got the first Count of Barcelona.

<text>David Charles Dingwall (born June 29, 1952) is a Canadian administrator, former Canadian Cabinet minister and civil servant. He is the president of Cape Breton University.

==Political career==
A lawyer by training, Dingwall was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1980 Canadian federal election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Cape Breton—East Richmond in Nova Scotia. He was re-elected in three subsequent elections, and served as Opposition House Leader from 1991 to 1993.

===In Cabinet===
After the Liberals won the 1993 Canadian election under Jean Chrétien, Dingwall was appointed to Cabinet as the Minister of Public Works and Minister of Supply and Services, Minister responsible for Canada Post, Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing, Minister responsible for the Royal Canadian Mint, Minister responsible for Defence Construction Limited, and the Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. Dingwall also served on several cabinet committees, including the Treasury Board and Economic Development. In 1996, Dingwall convinced the then prime minister of Canada to host the G7 Summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Leaders from the G7 convened in Halifax and Boris Yeltsin, the president of Russia was a special attendee at that session. In 1996, Dingwall was appointed Minister of Health. In 1997, Dingwall passed the Tobacco Control Act, which at the time was the toughest tobacco legislation in the world. He was subsequently honoured by the Canadian Cancer Society and the World Health Organization.

===1997 election===
Dingwall ran for re-election in 1997 in the newly created riding of Bras d&#x27;Or, losing by over 1,000 votes to Michelle Dockrill of the NDP.

==After politics==
Following his defeat in 1997, Dingwall was given an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University College of Cape Breton, recipient of the Connaught Award presented by the Canadian Lung Association. Dingwall served as president of Wallding International, a government relations firm and served on several corporate board of directors, including, Rogers Sugar Income Fund, MD Life, advisory board, State Street Global Advisors Inc., director of Webstandard Inc., and director of Journeys End Car Rental Limited.

==Royal Canadian Mint==

On February 27, 2003, the Government of Canada appointed Dingwall to the position of president and chief executive officer of the Royal Canadian Mint. His leadership led that organization to increase profitability and posting its first surplus in several years.

In the fall of 2005, Dingwall came under scrutiny for having allegedly made excessive expense claims while he was president of the Royal Canadian Mint. In the midst of these allegations, Dingwall resigned from the Mint on September 28, 2005. When questioned while giving testimony before Parliament as to why he felt he should receive a severance package after the voluntary resignation, he remarked &quot;I&#x27;m entitled to my entitlements.&quot; The statement would be used by the Conservatives in a television advertisement during the 2006 federal election that featured that part of Dingwall&#x27;s testimony.

On leaving the Royal Canadian Mint, Dingwall called for an independent audit which was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers who found &quot;the expenses fell within the guidelines&quot;. A second independent review by the law firm of Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt found that the Mint&#x27;s process for monitoring expenses were stricter than those of most private corporations. On or about February 4, 2006, retired Superior Court Justice George Adams found that the Government of Canada essentially forced Dingwall out when he released his findings in a binding arbitration ruling.

==Legal career==
Dingwall is a member of the Nova Scotia Barristers’ Society and Law Society of Upper Canada. He was associated with the law firm of Sampson McDougall in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and now he is counsel to the law firm of Affleck Greene McMurtry LLP.

==Academic career==
For the 2011–2012 academic year, Dingwall was a distinguished visiting professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University.

==Community involvement==
Dingwall is a member of the board of directors of the Canada/China Business Council, a founding member of the Toronto Arbitrators’ Society, president of the Metropolitan Toronto Condominium Corporation.

==As President of Cape Breton University==
On January 31, 2018, Dingwall was appointed president and vice-chancellor of Cape Breton University by the university&#x27;s board of governors.

<text>The Saco River ( , Abenaki: &quot;Sαkóhki&quot;) is a river in northeastern New Hampshire and southwestern Maine in the United States. It drains a rural area of of forests and farmlands west and southwest of Portland, emptying into the Atlantic Ocean at Saco Bay, from its source. It supplies drinking water to roughly 250,000 people in thirty-five towns; and historically provided transportation and water power encouraging development of the cities of Biddeford and Saco and the towns of Fryeburg and Hiram.

Samuel de Champlain sailed a portion of the river in 1605 and referred to it as &quot;Chouacoet&quot;, which he said was the name used by the Almouchiquois people. Various sources also give their name as &quot;Sokoki&quot; (a term also used for the Missiquoi people of western New England) and as being either the ancestors or close relatives of the Pequawket who lived along the river near present-day Fryeburg. William O. Bright attributed the origin of &quot;Saco&quot; to an Eastern Abenaki language word meaning &quot;land where the river comes out&quot;, which he connected to similar place names like Saugus, said to come from the Pawtucket word for &quot;outlet&quot;.

==Course==
The river rises at Saco Lake in Crawford Notch in the White Mountains and flows generally south-southeast through Bartlett and Conway in Carroll County, New Hampshire before crossing into Oxford County, Maine.

Shortly after entering Fryeburg, Maine, the river branches into the &quot;Old Course&quot; Saco River and the more commonly used &quot;Canal River&quot;. Constructed in the 1800s to be more convenient for farmers, the canal is shorter than the old course and is now considered to be the official course for the river, as the upstream end of the old course is largely silted over. The two channels merge again near Lovell, Maine.

After running through six hydropower stations operated by NextEra Energy Resources (including Skelton Dam and Bonny Eagle Dam), the river enters York County, crosses under Interstate 95, and passes between Saco and Biddeford, where it is bridged by U.S. Route 1. It enters Saco Bay on the Atlantic with Camp Ellis in Saco on the north shore and Hills Beach in Biddeford on the south shore.

==Stream flow==
The United States government maintains two stream gauges on the Saco River. The first is at Conway, New Hampshire (), where the river&#x27;s watershed is . Discharge (stream flow) here averages and has ranged from a minimum of to a maximum of . The second is at Cornish, Maine () where the watershed is . Flow here averages and has ranged from a minimum of to a maximum of .

==Attractions==

The Saco is a popular recreational river, drawing an estimated 3,000 to 7,000 people per summer weekend, mostly on the stretch from Swan&#x27;s Falls (a campground formerly maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club and now maintained by the Saco River Recreation Council) to Brownfield, Maine.

There are many sand beaches along the Saco when not at flood stage, and camping is allowed along some of these beaches for free. Misuse, including large quantities of garbage left behind by users and illegal fires, as well as discourtesy toward landowners, has led many beaches to be posted and monitored. A permit is required from the State of Maine for campfires along any unposted river beaches.

The Saco is a major attraction for canoeists. One area of the river, Walker&#x27;s Rip, is a set of rapids that has caused less talented canoers to capsize, although it can be navigated successfully. Several canoeing rentals are available throughout the river&#x27;s distance.

The Saco River is also famous for sport fishing, even though the number of fish in it has decreased tremendously throughout time.

==Problems==
Multiple violent and reportedly alcohol-related incidents in 2001 led to increased police patrols and efforts by livery companies, landowners, and government agencies to improve conditions.

<text>The British Rail Class 308 alternating current (AC) electric multiple units (EMU) were built by British Railways&#x27; Holgate Road carriage works in three batches between 1959 and 1961. They were initially classified as AM8 units before the introduction of TOPS.

==Description==

===Class 308/1===
The first batch of 33 units were built in 1959, classified as AM8 and numbered 133–165. This was later changed to Class 308/1 under the TOPS system, and units were renumbered 308133–165. These units were built to operate commuter services on the Great Eastern Main Line (GEML) from to , , , and . Each unit was formed of four carriages: two outer driving trailers, an intermediate trailer, and a motor coach.

Electrically the Class 308 stock has the same equipment as the Class 302 stock with a few modifications, some of these are the types of overload, the use of fan-cooled rectifier continued until the rectifiers were modified to 8-diode type from 1982. This modified main rectifier was also modified and used on the Class 309 stock due to the problems of fan-cooled types suffering from blocked filters causing failures in traffic. The braking system is basically the same as the Class 302 stock with the exception of the motor coach retaining the cylinder rather than the as fitted to Class 302 after replacing the cast-iron brake blocks with composite (Ferodo) type.

From 1981 to 1983, the units were refurbished, which included opening out compartments, fitting of gangways between carriages, and moving first class seating from the intermediate trailer to one of the driving trailers, with the same problems as the Class 302 stock of having first class passengers sitting above the Westinghouse CM38 compressor, however the Gresley bogies being retained. In this modified form, the technical description of the formation was BDTCOL+MBSO+TSOL+DTSO. Individual carriages were numbered as follows:
*75878-75886 and 75896-75919 - BDTCOL
*61883-61915 - MBSO
*70611-70643 - TSOL
*75887-75895 and 75929-75952 - DTSO

===Class 308/2===
A second batch of nine units, numbered 313–321, were built for boat train services on the London, Tilbury and Southend line in 1959–60, from London Fenchurch Street to . These units were later reclassified as Class 308/2 under TOPS. Each unit was formed of four carriages: two outer driving trailers, an intermediate trailer, and a motor luggage van, with the reduction in luggage some MLV&#x27;s were converted at Swindon Works with a different seating arrangement to the original passenger vehicles. The technical description of the formation was BDTS+MLV+TC+DTS. Individual carriages were numbered as follows:
*75920-75928 - BDTS
*68011-68019 - MLV (68011 - 68014 from units 313-316 converted to MBSO in 1971 and renumbered 62431–62434. Units reclassified as Class 308/4)
*70644-70652 - TC
*75953-75961 - DTS
When Tilbury Docks closed as a cruise liner terminal, these units were made redundant and withdrawn from service in 1983. Three units were subsequently rebuilt as Class 308/4 parcels units for Rail Express Systems (see below).

===Class 308/3===
Finally, a third batch of 3-car units were built in 1961 for suburban services from London Liverpool Street to and . They were numbered 453–455, following on from the Class 305/1 units, which also operated these services (which were numbered in the range 401–452).

These units were later reclassified as Class 308/3, and renumbered 308453–455 under TOPS. Unlike the first batch, these units contained no first-class seating. Each unit was formed of three carriages: two outer driving trailers, and an intermediate motor coach. The technical description of the unit formation was BDTS+MBS+DTS. Individual carriages numbers were as follows:
*75741-75743 - BDTS
*61689-61691 - MBS
*75992-75994 - DTS
These units were withdrawn in the late 1980s.

===Converted postal units===
In 1983, three former Class 308/2 units (nos. 314/319/321) were converted into Class 308/4 postal units by the Parcels sector, with the removal of the intermediate trailer, and renumbered 308991–993. These units were replaced by three converted Class 302/9 parcels units in 1992.

==Operations==
By the early 1990s, only the Class 308/1 units were still in service. These were gradually replaced on GEML services by the new Class 321s. Some of the displaced units were transferred to the London, Tilbury and Southend line (LTS), whilst others were transferred to the West Midlands to work Cross-City Line services pending the introduction of new Class 323s. The LTS units were later displaced by Class 312s, but two were retained and converted to Class 937 sandite units. These sandite units were originally fitted with a small cement mixer that was used to mix the sandite and then loaded into the hoppers whilst the vehicle was in motion. Later, premixed sandite was loaded prior to use with the easing of the physical work by the staff.

In 1994–95, electrification spread north from to Bradford, and . As no new stock had been ordered, Regional Railways overhauled Class 308 units for use on these services. The work was carried out at Doncaster Works and involved reducing the unit length to three carriages, with the removal of the intermediate trailers, which were scrapped. The trains were also painted in West Yorkshire Metro crimson and cream livery.

In 1996, with the privatisation of British Rail, the Class 308 fleet passed into the ownership of Angel Trains and were leased to the Regional Railways North East franchise. This was originally operated as Northern Spirit, but the franchise was later taken over by Arriva and operated as Arriva Trains Northern.

By the late 1990s, it was clear that the elderly Class 308 units needed replacing. Due to their age, they were increasingly unreliable and expensive to maintain. They were replaced by sixteen new 3-car Class 333 units, which were introduced from 12 January 2001, all 16 Class 333 units were later lengthened to 4-car sets.
The Class 308 units were withdrawn and sent for storage at MoD Shoeburyness. The final three units, nos. 308138/157/158, were withdrawn in late 2001, and were sent for scrap at Immingham. Since then, the stored units have slowly been scrapped at various locations, with the final vehicles disposed of in 2004. However, one driving trailer was saved for preservation.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 14 February 1990, an empty stock train formed of a Class 305 and a Class 308 unit was derailed at .

==Preservation==
One driving trailer from unit 308136 has been saved for preservation.
*75881 - Colne Valley Railway; restoration ongoing.

The carriage has been stripped of asbestos, and the full internal rebuild was abandoned in favour of housing the salvaged parts of the London Underground Victoria Line Cobourg Street signalling centre, and much of the former Brixton interlocking machine room equipment. The Cobourg Street equipment is now partially working, with work ongoing to allow simulated train movements to be displayed.

<text>The Islands of Furness are situated to the south-west and east of the Furness Peninsula. Within England, they are the third biggest collection of islands. They are generally quite small, though at 12.99 km2 Walney Island is the eighth biggest in England. Of these, only Walney Island, Barrow Island, Roa Island and Piel Island are inhabited. The majority of the islands lay within the boundary of the former Borough of Barrow-in-Furness, with some 15,000 residents constituting 20% of the district&#x27;s population. They are the largest group of islands between Anglesey in Wales and the Firth of Clyde in Scotland.

The main islands are:

*Walney Island - Population 10,651 (Settlements include Biggar, North Scale, North Walney and Vickerstown)
*Barrow Island - Population 2,616 
*Sheep Island - Population 0
*Roa Island - Population ~100
*Piel Island - Population ~10
*Foulney Island - Population 0
*Chapel Island - Population 0

As well as these, the small islets of Dova Haw, also known as &quot;Crab Island&quot; and Headin Haw sit in Walney Channel, whilst the old Ramsey Island is now, like Barrow Island, part of the docks system.

Chapel, Piel, Foulney and Sheep Islands are tidal and can be walked to at low tide, with appropriate care. Anyone wishing to walk to Piel and Chapel Islands should seek local advice as fast tides and quicksands can be extremely dangerous.

<text>The DMS-100 is a member of the Digital Multiplex System (DMS) product line of telephone exchange switches manufactured by Northern Telecom. Designed during the 1970s and released in 1979, it can control 100,000 telephone lines.

The purpose of the DMS-100 Switch is to provide local service and connections to the PSTN public telephone network. It is designed to deliver services over subscribers&#x27; telephone lines and trunks. It provides plain old telephone service (POTS), mobility management for cellular phone systems, sophisticated business services such as automatic call distribution (ACD), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), and Meridian Digital Centrex (MDC), formerly called Integrated Business Network (IBN). It also provides Intelligent Network functions (AIN, CS1-R, ETSI INAP). It is used in countries throughout the world.

There are also DMS-200 and DMS-250 variants for tandem switches. Much of the hardware used in the DMS-100, with the possible exception of the line cards, is used in other members of the DMS family, including the DMS-200 toll switch.

==Hardware==
All power distribution is at -48 VDC (nominal), from which DC to DC converters on every shelf provide other necessary voltages.

===Central Control Complex (CCC)===
The Central Control Complex comprises the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Program Store (PS), Data Store (DS) and the Central Message Controller (CMC).

The CPU contains two identical 16-bit processors running in hot standby mode. The original CPU core was referred to as the NT40 CPU and was implemented in approximately 250 discrete logic devices across several circuit boards running at 36 MHz. The NT40 core consisted mainly of the NT1X44 stack card, which provides some register and stack functions of the processor, the NT1X45 which contained the arithmetic and logic functions, the NT1X46 which provides more registers and the load-route read-only memory (ROM) and the NT1X47 timing and control card which provides the micro-cycle source and microstore decoding functions of the processor. The NT1X47 card also contained the 2-digit hexadecimal display to indicate test result codes and the condition of the core. The NT1X48 processor maintenance card contained a thumbwheel on the faceplate to enable various diagnostic tests of the CPU. A later modification of these same five circuit boards with faster pin-compatible discrete logic devices enabled the CPU to operate at 40 MHz allowing central offices to improve call throughput capacity by 10 percent. When the CPU is configured in dual hot standby mode, a mate exchange bus (MEB) between the two CPUs enables the state of one CPU to be continuously compared to that of the other CPU on a cycle by cycle basis. Any discrepancy between the two CPUs results in maintenance circuitry determining which CPU is at fault and activity to change to the same CPU.

A Program Store is dedicated to each CPU and is a memory for the program instructions required by that CPU for processing calls, maintenance and for administrative tasks. The PS associated with the other CPU contains identical program instructions.

A Data Store is dedicated with each CPU and contains dynamic information on a per-call basis, as well as customer data and office-specific settings. The other CPU is also associated with its own DS containing duplicate data.

The Central Message Controller controls the flow of messages between the other units of the CCC and prioritizes them for the Network Message Controller (NMC) in the various Network Modules (NM), or the Input/Output Controller (IOC). Both CPUs have access to either CMC which share the message load to the Line Modules or peripherals.

The original NT40 based CCC was replaced by the compatible DMS SuperNode in 1987.

===DMS SuperNode===
The DMS SuperNode Computing Module was first based on the Motorola 68020 Central Processing Unit (CPU) and then upgraded to the Motorola 68030. In the early 1990s it was further upgraded to use the Motorola 88100 and 88110 Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) CPUs. This RISC version of the SuperNode Computing Module was known as the BRISC (BNR Reduced Instruction Set Computing) CPU. With the BRISC CPU the DMS SuperNode had a processing capacity of 1,500,000 call attempts per hour.

DMS SuperNode featured increased processing capacity across a distributed architecture allowing for the development of new features and services. Each of the elements of the DMS SuperNode uses a common SuperNode CPU hardware design differing only in the software used to control them. The SuperNode consists of two main elements: DMS Core and DMS Bus. 
DMS Core provides the main computing facility and is made up of the Compute Module, System Load Module and a Message Controller. The Compute Module contains redundant SuperNode CPUs to handle call processing and maintenance functions and, like the NT40 core, can operate in a synchronized mode with its mate. The System Load Module contains all the necessary software for every element of the DMS switch and also provides file system and data storage functions on magnetic tape and hard disk. The Message Controller provides communications links between the DMS Core and the DMS Bus.

DMS Bus is used to interconnect the DMS Core, the switching network and the Input/Output controller (IOC) and manage message flows between these units and consists of redundant Message Switches. The Message Switches of the DMS Bus operate in a load-sharing mode and one of them provides the main clock source for the DMS-100 system while the others are synchronized to it. Messages between all SuperNode units are carried by optical DS512 links.

The operating system used by both generations of the DMS-100 switch was called Support Operating System (SOS) and was written in a high level language called PROTEL which stood for PRocedure Oriented Type Enforcing Language developed at Bell Northern Research (BNR).

Hardware and maintenance are administered locally through cathode-ray terminals, through a multilevel menu system called MAPCI. There are various methods used to access the DMS remotely as well, including modem and telnet. Backups and other hard drive work are administered through a DISKUT command line program.

===Line Module===
Analog lines are terminated on individual line cards, each with its own codec, in pull-out Line Drawers in frames. The original design of such frames was called the Line Module (LM) with 32 lines per drawer. LMs were not able to send caller-id information (CLASS services) and became rare late in the century, having been supplemented or replaced by the newer Line Concentrating Module (LCM). Duplicated ringing generators serve each LM or pair of LCM. For DC testing, each line card has a relay to connect it to a test bus.

===Line Concentrating Module===
LCM have smaller line cards, serving 64 lines per physical drawer (two logical drawers) of the same size as in the LM. An LCM requires only half the space as an LM for the same number of lines. The majority of line cards are NT6X17, with three relays for loop start lines. Others include NT6X18 which have four or more relays and a slide switch for ground start lines (a newer version of the NT6X18 has eliminated the ground switch). The NT6X18 also has the ability to provide current reversal required for some coin phones and business systems. The NT6X17B and the NT6X18B is known as the world line card and is software configurable to more than 15 million functional settings to meet almost any signalling and transmission requirement in any market. 
NT6X19 line cards allow the use of older style, neon message-waiting lamps, this feature also requires an additional card per drawer that supplies the voltage. Type NT6X21 cards serve P-sets (Meridian Business Sets), a special analogue telephone with a proprietary Nortel data link operating at 8 kHz to provide advanced call handling services. For example, a telephone number may appear on multiple P-sets even though each such telephone has only one pair of wires, thus providing a simpler replacement for key telephone systems. An LCME, for ISDN service, which uses NTBX27 cards serve Basic Rate ISDN lines. When provided with ring generators, an LCME can also support other linecard types. LCMs are served by a Line Group Controller (LGC) and communicate over DS-30 connections to NT6X48AA interface cards on the LGC. The number of LCMs per LGC depends on traffic: 3-4 LCM per LGC but as few as two where traffic is heavy.

===Remote Cluster Controller===
Remote offices, anywhere from a kilometre to 100 km from the host, can be served by a Remote Line control Module (RLCM), Remote Switching Center (RSC); a later vintage is known as RCC2. They use T1 links to the host LGC. RCCs/RCC2s work like LTCs in controlling LCMs. Large remotes may have 2+ RCC/RCCs and they can be equipped with links between the RCCs - Interlinks; so calls within the remote do not tie up host links. The RCCs/RCC2s are usually equipped so they will provide calling within the remote office if the host links fail; this feature is called ESA; Emergency Stand Alone.

===Remote Units===
Another type of remote office is known as Remote Carrier Urban (RCU). Such units typically reside on the side of a road in a large box, approx 3 meters across, almost 2 meters high and almost a meter through. In the 1980s many telcos installed an early version of these instead of pulling more cable into a remote area. They were much cheaper and could provide up to approx 500 lines. Back then they needed two &#x27;boxes&#x27; to work- a host box called a Central Terminal (CT) that had the dial tone lines wired into it and a remote box called a Remote terminal (RT) where the dial tone &#x27;came out&#x27;. They used 2-6 T1 links on copper - i.e. LD-1 or fiber. As telcos modernized, these remote boxes were re-configured to work directly from a SMU peripheral at the host DMS. Typically each SMU can handle 3-6 RCUs.

===Trunk Modules===
Transmitters, receivers and other service circuits are in Trunk Module (TM) and Miscellaneous Trunk Module (MTM) shelves. Trunks are on DTC (Digital Trunk Controller) or DTCI (Digital Trunk Controller ISDN) or PDTC (PCM30 Digital Trunk Controller) shelves, usually two T-1 lines per card, ten cards per DTC for a total of 480 DS-0 voice channels. At the turn of the century many original NT6X50AA cards were still in service that cannot perform T-carrier extended superframe signaling, this can be performed with a plug-in replacement NT6X50AB card, used for services such as PBX ISDN T1s. Trunks can also be provisioned on SPM (Synchronous Peripheral Module) capable of handling 2016 DS0s, nearly 4.2x more than the DTC.

===Line Controllers===
Internal connections to the time switch (network) are on 2.56 Mbit/s (DS-30) Speech Links, each carrying thirty channels plus synchronization and data channels, on four wires plus a ground wire. Connections to the network are handled by the NT6X40AA DS-30 interface card on an LGC or LTC and these link may also be DS-512 optical interfaces. Using the NT6X44AA time switch card, LGCs and LTCs internally map channels on the NT6X48AA DS-30 &amp; NT6X50AA/AB DS1 interface links to available channels on NT6X40AA DS-30 or NT6X40FA DS-512 interfaces out to the network. European PDTCs were complemented by the DTCOI2 and DTCO2. The DTCOI2 was designed to run PRI and DPNSS services as per existing PDTCOI and MSB7 peripherals. The DTCO2 was designed to carry CAS and SS7 as per existing PDTCO peripheral.
Time Division switching is performed in E-Net, similar to the Communication Module of 5ESS switch or the Switching Network of EWSD or the Group Switch of AXE telephone exchange.

==Successors==
There are also DMS-200 and DMS-250 variants for tandem switches.

In 2006 Nortel introduced the Communication Server 1500 (CS 1500) Softswitch based on VOIP to modernize the DMS-based telephone switches. A CS 1500 softswitch system can replace all the DMS component modules except for the LCMs, reducing the footprint of a DMS-100 to one 19&quot; rack and allowing operators to reduce cooling and power requirements significantly.

A successor to the DMS-100 is the Communication Server 2000 (CS2K), which shares many components and software with the DMS. The significant difference is the addition of VOIP technology into the CS2K.

In 2010, Genband purchased Nortel Networks&#x27; Carrier VoIP and Application Solutions (CVAS) business for $182.5 million. Nortel is now defunct.

<doc id="1112901" wikidata="Q648060" url="?curid=1112901" title="Privilegium Minus">
<text>The  was a deed issued by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa on 17 September 1156. It included the elevation of the Bavarian frontier march of Austria () to a duchy, which was given as an inheritable fief to the House of Babenberg.

==Content==
The name is opposed to the 14th century &#x27;, which was a forgery drawn up at the behest of the Habsburg duke Rudolf IV of Austria. The recipient of the &#x27; was Frederick&#x27;s paternal half-uncle, the Babenberg margrave Henry II Jasomirgott.

In addition to the elevation of his margraviate, the emperor determined that inheritance should also be possible through the female line of the ducal family. In the absence of children, the duke was allowed to designate a successor (&#x27;). However, this extraordinary privilege was bound to the persons of Henry Jasomirgott and his wife Theodora Komnene (&#x27;) for life, as both had no children and Henry&#x27;s brothers Otto I of Freising and Conrad I of Passau had chosen ecclesiastical careers. The emperor reserved for himself the act of enfeoffment but would respect Henry&#x27;s choice.

The duke&#x27;s duty to attend the Imperial Diet was limited to those cases where it convened within the Bavarian lands (&#x27;), which saved costly traveling throughout the Empire. Also, Austria was henceforth only required to provide troops to the emperor in wars in its vicinity (&#x27;). Henry Jasomirgott was obliged to further on discharge his traditional duties as former margrave.

==Background==
The issue of the &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot; document is to be seen within the context of the conflict that pitted the Imperial House of Hohenstaufen against the ducal House of Welf in the Holy Roman Empire. In 1138 Emperor Frederick&#x27;s uncle and predecessor, King Conrad III of Germany had deposed the reluctant Bavarian duke Henry the Proud and had enfeoffed his duchy to the Austrian margrave Henry Jasomirgott. King Conrad died in February 1152 and a few weeks later his nephew Frederick was elected King of the Romans, probably with the support of late Henry the Proud&#x27;s son Henry the Lion.

The young king and Henry the Lion were cousins through Frederick&#x27;s mother Judith of Bavaria, sister of Henry the Proud. Frederick prepared for a campaign to Rome to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor and in order to gain military support wished to end the conflict he had inherited from his uncle. He called for a diet at Würzburg —however, Henry Jasomirgott, who anticipated the king&#x27;s intentions, did not appear under the pretext that he had not been duly summoned. After several attempts to make an arrangement, Frederick left for Italy and was crowned Emperor on 18 June 1155.

Back in Germany, Frederick resolved upon returning the Duchy of Bavaria to Henry the Lion. He finally was able to hold a secret meeting with Henry Jasomirgott on 5 June 1156 near the Bavarian capital Regensburg. After the conditions were fixed, the emperor called for another diet in Regensburg on 8 September, where the Babenberger officially renounced the Bavarian duchy, which passed to the Welf Henry the Lion. To make up for the loss, Austria with the explicit consent by the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, led by Duke Vladislaus II of Bohemia, was raised to the status of a duchy. Frederick thereby avoided the degradation of Henry Jasomirgott to the rank of a margrave, which would have lacked any explanation and furthermore would have exposed Henry Jasomirgott to persecution by the Welfs. On the other hand, Henry the Lion only received a diminished Bavarian duchy and Henry Jasomirgott&#x27;s right of &quot;&quot; would prevent any succession of the House of Welf in Austria. Disappointed, Henry the Lion turned to his Saxon estates in Northern Germany.

Frederick prevailed, settling the long-time conflict, keeping the Welfs covered and securing support by the House of Babenberg.
Only much later, the document turned out to be the founding act for what was to become a nation. 1156 is therefore sometimes given as Austria&#x27;s date of independence, which it gained from Bavaria.

==Application==

===13th century succession crisis===
Because the Babenberg Austria was inheritable by female lines, two rival candidates emerged after the last male Babenberg Frederick II, Duke of Austria, Styria and Carinthia died in 1246.

* Herman VI, Margrave of Baden (died 1250), second husband of Gertrude of Babenberg, the daughter of the late Henry of Mödling, the elder brother of the now late Duke Frederick. She was the primogenitural heir of Duke Frederick and the entire Babenberg line of Dukes of Austria. Her first husband Vladislav of Bohemia, Margrave of Moravia (died 1247) had already claimed the Austrian duchy against duke Frederick, as Gertrude was heiress of the elder brother. After Herman&#x27;s death, her third husband Roman, Prince of Novogrudok (married 1252, divorced 1253) continued the claim in 1252-53. And then Gertrude and Herman&#x27;s son Frederick I, Margrave of Baden&#x27;s claim was asserted to the Babenberg inheritance, but he was killed in 1268, leaving a sister (the future Countess of Heunburg) to continue the line.
* King Ottokar II of Bohemia (1233–78), since 1252 husband of the (childless) Margaret of Babenberg, dowager Queen of the Romans and the only surviving sister of Duke Frederick. By proximity of blood, she was the closest surviving relative of the last duke. Ottokar and Margaret were proclaimed Duke and Duchess of Austria. However, Margaret was barren and they got divorced in 1260, Ottokar marrying a younger woman. Margaret died in 1267 and left no children (so her heiress would be Gertrude again) - but Ottokar kept Austria, Styria etc. claiming to be the heir designated by Margaret in their divorce settlement. He held the duchies until deposed by king Rudolf I of Germany in 1276.

===18th century succession crisis===
The Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 was partially based on provisions of the &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot; of Austria. Although not given to the Habsburgs but to the Babenbergs, it anyway allowed female heirs to succeed in Austria, and it designated to the Duke the right to name a successor in absence of heirs. It led to the War of Austrian Succession.

<text>Marc Cerrone (, ; born 24 May 1952) is a French disco drummer, composer, record producer and creator of concerts. Cerrone is a producer of 1970s and 1980s disco songs. He has sold over 30 million albums worldwide, including over four million copies in France, and eight million copies of &quot;Supernature&quot;. The single &quot;Love in C Minor&quot; (1976) reached No. 3 and was in the charts for two months, selling three million copies. With &quot;Supernature&quot; (1977), Cerrone merged symphonic orchestration with synthesizers. At the 1978 Billboard Disco Forum, Cerrone received six awards including Disco Artist of the Year.

In addition to &quot;Love in C Minor&quot;, &quot;Cerrone&#x27;s Paradise&quot; and &quot;Supernature&quot;, Marc Cerrone enjoyed success in Europe with albums such as &quot;Cerrone IV: The Golden Touch&quot; (1978), &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; (1983), &quot;The Collector&quot; (1985), &quot;Human Nature&quot; (1994) and more recently with the dance albums &quot;Hysteria&quot; (2002) and &quot;Celebrate&quot; (2007). Cerrone is also known for live performances. In 1991 he played on the show &quot;Harmony&quot; to celebrate the launch of Japan&#x27;s first high-definition TV satellite. The rock opera was played to over 800,000 spectators at Tokyo harbour. Cerrone adapted &quot;Harmony&quot; for theatre. In 1992, the musical &quot;Dreamtime&quot; which was based on an original story by Cerrone ran for 140 shows on Broadway at New York&#x27;s Ed Sullivan Theater.

Cerrone has recorded and performed with Nile Rodgers, Toto, Laura Branigan, Jocelyn Brown, La Toya Jackson and Axelle Red. His music has been sampled by artists such as the Avalanches, Bob Sinclar, the Beastie Boys and Run-DMC.

==Career==

Cerrone was born in Vitry-sur-Seine to the son of Italian immigrants. At the age of 12 he started playing drums and listening to Otis Redding songs. Cerrone&#x27;s passion for music was discouraged by his father, who tried to distract him from his obsession. By the end of the 1960s, he was fascinated by Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, among others. At the age of 17, he convinced Gilbert Trigano to hire rock bands for his holiday clubs: Club Med (Club Mediterranée). Cerrone became the A&amp;R scout for 40 Club Med vacation villages around the world.

===Kongas===
His first recordings as a part of Kongas were released on Barclay Records, where he issued his first hit single, &quot;Boom&quot;, and the 1974 album &quot;Afro-Rock&quot;. He is most famous from the Kongas days for &quot;Anikana-O&quot;, co-written and produced by Alec R. Costandinos. A remix was done by Tom Moulton for the US release on Salsoul Records. This mix was also used on other international releases.

===&quot;Love in C Minor&quot;===
Based in Paris, Cerrone recorded, composed, and performed his solo debut &quot;Love in C Minor&quot;, again with Costandinos. Released on his own Malligator imprint, and distributed by Warner Filipacchi in France, it immediately shocked audiences with its controversial cover. Copies of the LP were sent to the US, apparently in error, but it was heard by New York DJs who began playing it. Atlantic Records signed Cerrone to a contract, and the musician relocated to the U.S.
The album was later released with a new, tamer cover that took the nude women off and replaced them with four arms clenched and a black background instead for the American release. As well as &quot;Love in C Minor&quot;, it also featured a cover version of Los Bravos&#x27;s &quot;Black Is Black&quot; and &quot;Midnite Lady&quot;, an instrumental piece. Cotillion Records released the album through Warner distribution in the U.S. The album was released unedited in Canada, using the original master tapes. This was the final collaboration between Cerrone and the Egyptian-born Costandinos, who went on to create dancefloor hits such as &quot;I&#x27;ve Found Love&quot; by Love &amp; Kisses, and the disco opera re-telling of the story of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Cerrone&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau gave it a B-plus and wrote, &quot;Catchy tracks, a remake of &#x27;Black Is Black,&#x27; and a new standard in disco porn—the protagonist brings three women to simultaneous orgasm while keeping one finger on the &#x27;Door Close&#x27; button.&quot;

===&quot;Cerrone&#x27;s Paradise&quot;===
Cerrone continued using pieces of photographic and audio erotica when he released his second album, &quot;Cerrone&#x27;s Paradise&quot;. It was recorded with Alain Wisniak co writing and arranged by Raymond Donnez, also known as &quot;Don Ray&quot;, as part of his arrangement entourage after parting company with Costandinos. The original French album cover featured a naked model draped over the top of a fridge with a jar of white powder spilled in front of it. The U.S. Atlantic/Cotillion release featured a photo of Cerrone wearing a Hawaiian shirt.

===&quot;Supernature&quot;===

His third album, &quot;Supernature&quot; sold over eight million albums worldwide. A departure from the lush orchestration with electronic instrumentation added to the mix, it was co-written by Alain Wisniak. The lyrics to &quot;Supernature&quot;, written by Lene Lovich, have a sci-fi theme: it concerns the rebellion of mutant creatures—created by scientists to end starvation among mankind—against the humans. The album also featured &quot;Sweet Drums&quot;, a three-minute-and-ten-second drum breakdown. The original French album cover was again different, having a gatefold opening with nudes in the centre. The music itself was the same.

&quot;Supernature&quot; was used as the theme music to Thames TV&#x27;s &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot; (as well as being danced to by Hot Gossip in the same show), which was shown across the United Kingdom. More recently, on July 26, 2024, the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony used the theme Supernature as one of the main songs played with an outstanding spectacle of lights coming from the Eiffel Tower and performed by a sign language artist.

===&quot;The Golden Touch&quot;===
After the success of &quot;Supernature&quot;, &quot;Cerrone IV: The Golden Touch&quot; Cerrone signed up for management with Steven and Martin Machat. They helped oversee his worldwide career. Steven Machat negotiated a new deal for Cerrone in the US and Canada with Atlantic and CBS outside the US, Canada as well as France.

These were major artists deals for that time period. The album got great reviews in the US and Atlantic threw a party in New York City, October 1978 that was one of the largest parties ever thrown for an artist up to that point in time. The album was another Cerrone U.S. disco chart-topper. Driven by &quot;Je Suis Music&quot;, &quot;Look for Love&quot;, and the urban-slanted &quot;Rocket in the Pocket&quot; which featured Jimmy Page on guitar, this album showed his fusion attributes, foreshadowing his future releases.

Cerrone then ventured into movie scoring, supplying the music score for &quot;Brigade Mondaine&quot;, a French film. Alternate mixes of his hits were made, such as &quot;Give Me Love&quot;, &quot;Phonic&quot; (originally released as a 12-inch single on the Crocos label), and &quot;Striptease&quot;. The latter was an underground hit, introduced to international audiences through the Disconet subscription service for DJs. It was a key inclusion on &quot;Cerrone by Bob Sinclar&quot;.

===&quot;Cerrone V&quot;–&quot;XIII&quot;===
&quot;Cerrone V&quot; marked a radical departure for the artist, where he made a full-fledged attempt to become the vocalist. Moving from Cotillion to Atlantic Records in the U.S., &quot;Rock Me&quot; was the first single and, although clubs reacted fairly well, it did not reach the heights of his previous releases. Sonically, it bears a resemblance to &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; by Donna Summer. Recorded in Los Angeles with the musicians backing Toto, Cerrone co-wrote &quot;Call Me Tonight&quot; with producer Bob Esty and vocalist/lyricist Michelle Aller.

His sixth album, &quot;Cerrone VI&quot;, was the first of his albums not to be released in the U.S. and was issued on Malligator and Unidisc in Canada. Unlike his previous albums, this non-rhythmic offering, using new electronic elements such as the Fairlight CMI computer, was more of Cerrone exploring the entire musical landscape. Lyricist Pamela Forrest, a Liverpool-born, Paris-based lyricist, added her magic to the album. The instrumental, Herb Alpert-inspired &quot;Rendezvous&quot; received scattered Adult Contemporary airplay in Canada. Cerrone also returned to the erotic album covers, using an existing Cheyco Leidmann photograph of a bare-breasted blonde in a lawnchair, and inserting himself in the photograph.

In a true return to form, &quot;You Are the One&quot; was the cornerstone of his seventh record. An 11-minute version of &quot;Cherry Tree&quot; remains on the shelf. This album was rumoured to have been recorded twice: first with Stoke-on-Trent, England, native Kay Garner, long the voice of Cerrone&#x27;s biggest successes; and then with Brown. The version with Garner on the lead vocals has never been released.

As a bridge between Cerrone&#x27;s seventh and eighth albums, a 12-inch single, &quot;Tripping on the Moon&quot;, was released prior and was a blockbuster import hit. Sung by Kay Garner, and vocally reminiscent in tone of &quot;Supernature&quot;, it was never released in North America as a single. It later became a part of &quot;Cerrone VIII: Back Track&quot;. It was released on John Luongo&#x27;s Portrait label, distributed by CBS. Although the title track was a mild chart hit in the nightclub, the album&#x27;s lone bright spot was a re-recording of &quot;Supernature&quot; sung by Montreal-based Nanette Workman. Workman had a 1973 hit with the song &quot;The Queen&quot; on Big Tree Records. A short time thereafter, Canadian-born singer Claudja Barry did a cover version of &quot;Trippin&#x27;&quot;, released on Personal Records.

===1980s–1990s===
His ninth album, &quot;Your Love Survived&quot;, featured male lead vocals other than his own sung by Arthur Simms. Simms along with his brother John had also recorded an album entitled &quot;John &amp; Arthur Simms&quot; with Alec R. Costandinos on his Ibis/Casablanca imprint. Pamela Forrest also rejoined the cast, writing lyrics on the album. Re-recordings of hits such as &quot;Give Me Love&quot;, &quot;Look for Love&quot;, and &quot;Call Me Tonight&quot; were also featured on this double LP set. Key tracks included &quot;Get Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Workout&quot;.

Another return to form was his tenth album, &quot;Where Are You Now?&quot;. Sung by American Carole Rowley and released on Malligator in France, Hi-NRG producer and mixer Ian Levine was tabbed to do the mix, prompting a 12-inch release on the Record Shack label. In 1984, &quot;Club Underworld&quot; was also released as a single, in both France and the United States on Personal Records, with a new mix.

Perhaps the most-interesting Cerrone record that was never to be on a full-length album was his interpretation of &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Love&quot; intertwined with his own composition &quot;Freak Connection&quot;. It was released only in France.

Cerrone&#x27;s boutique label, Crocos, was the home to a number of independently produced projects. &quot;Africanism&quot; by Kongas, arranged by Don Ray, was an energetic fusion of tribal drum beats and emotive male vocals framed around a cover version of &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; by Traffic. It was licensed for North American distribution in a deal between Cerrone and Polydor U.S.

Don Ray&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Garden of Love&quot;, written with Cerrone, included hits such as &quot;Got to Have Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Body &amp; Soul&quot;, and &quot;Standing in the Rain&quot; guided the album to No. 1 Stateside. Lene Lovich wrote the lyrics.

Revelacion, a studio act, released two albums: a side-long version of &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; on Crocos (which was also released at almost the same time as Santa Esmeralda&#x27;s second album) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give A Damn&quot;, a 16-minute electronic-spiced, downtempo track recalling &quot;Music of Life&quot; on Malligator.

He also produced the singles &quot;Tonight the Night&quot; for percussionist Mo Foster and &quot;Phonic&quot; by Cristal, the latter of which echoes the synth boom that was started by Space&#x27;s &quot;Magic Fly&quot;. A song featuring La Toya Jackson was also issued, entitled &quot;Oops, Oh No&quot;.

In 1992, Cerrone&#x27;s show &quot;Dreamtime&quot; ran on Broadway at the Ed Sullivan Theater. In 1995 the &quot;Dream&quot; CD, with music from the Broadway musical &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, was released by Malligator, a division of Unidisc Music Inc.

===21st Century===
In 2000, Bob Sinclar worked with Cerrone for his disco album &quot;Cerrone by Bob Sinclar&quot;, which was released the following year.

In 2002, he released the album &quot;Hysteria&quot;. The song &quot;Hysteria&quot; was the only single from the album. In February 2005, he signed the score of the French adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; given in the Cirque d&#x27;Hiver in Paris.
In 2005, Cerrone was promoted to the rank of Commandeur in the Order of Arts and Letters. 

By 2007, he issued the song &quot;Laisser Toucher&quot;. It is the lead single from his album &quot;Celebrate!&quot;, released in early 2008. The second single from the album was &quot;Misunderstanding&quot;.

Cerrone issued his twentieth album release, &quot;Love Ritual&quot;, on 7 July 2008. The lead single is the title track which preceded the full-length album. &quot;Love Ritual&quot; also has a supporting music video. It was quickly followed by the next two singles, &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; and &quot;Tattoo Woman&quot;. The single, &quot;Tattoo Woman&quot; with remixes by Jamie Lewis was made available domestically in the U.S. on traxsource.com.

By 2009, Joey Negro released a remix of Cerrone&#x27;s &quot;Paradise&quot;. In the same year, Cerrone was one of the members of the jury of the television program &quot;X Factor&quot; in France on W9 and in Belgium on RTL-TVI.

On 12 March 2009, Cerrone released the album &quot;Cerrone by Jamie Lewis&quot; for free on his website. He stated that &quot;music is condemned to be free and that it is necessary to find other solutions to make revenues&quot;.

&quot;Cerrone Symphony, Variations of Supernature&quot; was released in February 2010 with a first single: &quot;Supernature Project&quot; featuring Dax Riders. &quot;Supernature Symphony&quot; took place in Paris-La-Défense on 2 October 2010, in the evening of &quot;Nuit Blanche&quot;. It was the first date of his tour which included Los Angeles, London, Rome, Dubai and Moscow.
In September 2016 he released the single &quot;Move Me&quot; featuring Brendan Reilly as a precursor to the forthcoming album &quot;Red Lips&quot;.

It was followed by a remix EP of the same song in January 2017 released through Big Beat Atlantic Records.

==Performances==

He performed in large concerts and events such as the 2005 Dance Party Live in Versailles and the 2000 Los Angeles Millennium Célébration where, at the request of the Mayor of Los Angeles, Cerrone staged the beginnings of Hollywood cinema era. In 1989 he performed in the concert at Paris&#x27;s Place de la Concorde for the celebration of the bicentenary of the French Revolution.

In 1991 he performed a concert event in Tokyo for the launch of the first HD satellite TV channel in Japan.

<text>Shavar Thomas (born 29 January 1981) is a retired Jamaican footballer and current assistant coach of FC Cincinnati 2 of MLS Next Pro.

==Career==
===Amateur and college===
Thomas played as a youth for Hazard United in Jamaica and at The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. He played college soccer at the University of Connecticut. He played two seasons, 2001 and 2002, and was named an NSCAA second team All-American his second year.

===Professional===
After that year, Thomas entered the 2003 MLS SuperDraft, where he was selected 10th overall by Dallas Burn. Thomas struggled in his first year, often appearing raw, but finished the season with 14 starts and 1252 minutes for the Burn. In the offseason, Thomas was traded to Kansas City Wizards in exchange for Eric Quill and Carey Talley. In his second year, Thomas established himself as a solid defender, playing center back for one of the league&#x27;s best defensive teams. He finished the season with 1880 minutes in 22 starts. Thomas continued as a starter in 2005 and 2006. On 23 March 2007, Thomas was traded to Los Angeles Galaxy for a conditional second-round draft pick. On 3 May 2007, he was traded to Chivas USA for a second-round pick in the 2009 MLS SuperDraft.

Thomas was selected by Philadelphia Union in the 2009 MLS Expansion Draft on 25 November 2009. He was traded to his former club Kansas City Wizards on 30 June 2010 in exchange for two MLS SuperDraft picks and allocation money.

Thomas remained with Kansas City through the 2011 season. At season&#x27;s end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Thomas was not selected in the draft and became a free agent.

Thomas signed with new MLS franchise Montreal Impact on 20 January 2012. On 2 November 2012 Montreal announced that Thomas would not be returning to the club in 2013. He entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a free agent after going undrafted in both rounds of the draft.

After leaving Fort Lauderdale, Thomas went on trial with Brunei DPMM of the S.League in November 2013.

===International===

==Management==
===Portmore United===
In August 2017, Thomas was named coach of Portmore United F.C. of the Red Stripe Premier League.

After two successive runners-up finishes in prior seasons, Thomas&#x27;s Portmore won the final, beating Waterhouse F.C. in penalties, earning the club&#x27;s sixth title overall, and first since 2012.

Thomas&#x27;s Portmore saw continued success during the 2018–19 season, finishing top of the table and winning the final for the club&#x27;s seventh title and Thomas&#x27;s second.

<text>Sir Arthur Lawrence Hobhouse (15 February 1886 – 20 January 1965) was a long-serving English local government Liberal politician, who is best remembered as the architect of the system of national parks of England and Wales.

==Early life==
Hobhouse was the son of prominent Liberal politician and MP Henry Hobhouse and the brother of peace activist, prison reformer, and religious writer Stephen Henry Hobhouse.

Arthur Hobhouse was educated at Eton College, St Andrews University and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in Natural Sciences. At Cambridge, he was a Cambridge Apostle and a member of the Cambridge University Liberal Club, becoming Secretary in 1906 and was also the lover of John Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant.

==Career==
Hobhouse practised as a solicitor until the outbreak of World War I, when he joined the British Expeditionary Force. After the War he joined the Claims Commission, dealing with claims against Allied forces in the Abbeville area, and rose to the rank of Staff Captain. Returning to civilian life, Hobhouse took to farming on a family estate Hadspen house and garden in Somerset.

==Political career==

He stood as Liberal candidate for Wells at the 1922 General Election when he finished a strong second. He was elected Member of Parliament for Wells at the 1923 General Election but lost the seat in 1924. He failed to regain Wells in 1929.

===Electoral record===











===Local government===
He was elected to Somerset County Council in 1925, became an alderman in 1934, and was chairman of the council from 1940 to 1947.

In 1945 he was appointed by Lewis Silkin, the Minister of Town and Country Planning, to chair the National Parks Committee. The resulting Hobhouse Report was the basis for the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Of the twelve parks it proposed, ten were implemented in the 1950s, while the remaining two, the New Forest and the South Downs, were proposed in 1999 and finally designated in 2005 and 2009, respectively.

Hobhouse was knighted in 1942. Sir Arthur also served as Chairman of the Rural Housing Committee 1942–1947, was pro-chancellor of Bristol University and was both Chairman and President of the County Councils Association (now part of the Local Government Association). For many years he was President of the Open Spaces Society, till his resignation in 1955.

==Personal life==
In his youth, Hobhouse&#x27;s affairs were exclusively homosexual. He had long-standing affairs with the Bloomsbury Group members Lytton Strachey, Duncan Grant, and John Maynard Keynes. Hobhouse was considered extremely desirable in Edwardian gay circles and was the subject of much infighting amongst the men of Bloomsbury.

Hobhouse married Konradin Huth Jackson, daughter of Frederick and Annabel Huth Jackson; they had five children:
*Elizabeth Hobhouse (1921–1995)
*Henry Hobhouse (1924–2016)
*Paul Rodbard Hobhouse (1927–1994)
*Mary Hermione Hobhouse (1934–2014)
*Anne Virginia Hobhouse (1936–2023)

Hobhouse&#x27;s eldest daughter married first Michael Francis Eden later Lord Henley, and secondly Michael King, son of Cecil Harmsworth King. Hobhouse&#x27;s eldest son, Henry, wrote &quot;Seeds of Change: Five Plants That Transformed Mankind&quot;. Henry was married three times, and had a daughter, Janet, who died in 1991. A younger son, Paul, married Penelope Chichester-Clark.

<doc id="1112929" wikidata="Q1001811" url="?curid=1112929" title="Burwash Landing">
<text>Burwash Landing is a small community, at historical mile 1093 on the Alaska Highway, in Yukon, Canada along the southern shore of Kluane Lake.

The present location of Burwash Landing was first used as a summer camp by the Southern Tutchone Athabascans until a trading post was built in the early 1900s by the Jacquot brothers.

The majority of the population are Aboriginal peoples, First Nations. The community is the administrative centre of the Kluane First Nation. In addition to the Alaska Highway, the community is served by the Burwash Airport.

It is the home of the Kluane Museum of Natural History and the Kluane First Nation, and also home to the world&#x27;s largest gold pan.

In July 1937, Robert Bates and Bradford Washburn, two members of the Harvard Mountaineering Club, made their way into Burwash Landing after climbing the Lucania peak and hiking over across the wilderness after their bush pilot was unable to retrieve them.

== Geography ==
Burwash Landing is above sea level at the airport. The elevation can be higher in some places and lower in the others. Burwash Landing is located on the Historic Milepost 1093 Alaska (Alcan) Highway. It sits on the northwest shore of Kluane Lake. Several prominent geographic features have been renamed in Southern Tutchone language.

=== Climate ===
Burwash Landing has a typical subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc), bordering on a dry-winter subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dwc). Burwash Landing holds the record for the warmest temperature ever recorded in the Yukon in January at , which was set on January 24, 2014. The previous Yukon record of , was set in Whitehorse on January 13, 2013.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Burwash Landing had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Southern Tutchone people ==
Burwash landing is the traditional home of the Southern Tutchone Athabascans. It used to be a summer camp. A revival of the Southern Tutchone language and culture has been taking place in this quiet lakeside community. This is readily apparent to visitors when they pull into town and are met with Southern Tutchone street and traffic signs, within and nearby Burwash Landing. Several prominent geographic features have been renamed in Southern Tutchone and signs can be seen along the Alaska (Alcan) Highway.

==Burls==
Burwash Landing is known for its black spruce burls. Burls start as an irritation in the spruce. The tree sends extra sap as healant, which creates a growth (burl). Burls are either &quot;green,&quot; harvested from live trees in the spring, or they are &quot;dry burls,&quot; taken from dead burl trees. Burls are peeled off their bark and used in their natural form as fenceposts, for example, or they may be shaped and finished into a variety of objects, such as bowls. Check the Burlbilly Hill on the Milepost 1061.6, the visitor will see rows of &quot;burly logs&quot; on the hill.

<doc id="1112933" wikidata="Q2394569" url="?curid=1112933" title="Tarrango">
<text>Tarrango is a red grape variety used in Australian wine production. This slow-ripening grape was created in 1965 by the CSIRO Horticultural Research Station at Merbein in Victoria, Australia, as a hybrid of Touriga Nacional and Sultana in order to create wines of good acidity, but low in tannin. Its wines are often similar to Beaujolais in style. Requiring an unusually warm climate, it is principally grown in the wine-producing areas of northern Victoria.

Brown Brothers has been the most prominent producer since the 1980s, selling &quot;Tarrango&quot; as a rosé.

<doc id="1112934" wikidata="Q3544167" url="?curid=1112934" title="USS Moray">
<text>USS &quot;Moray&quot; (SS-300), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the moray, a family of large eels found in crevices of coral reefs in tropical and subtropical oceans.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Moray&quot; was laid down on 21 April 1943 at Cramp Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; launched on 14 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Styles Bridges, wife of the New Hampshire Senator; and commissioned on 26 January 1945.

==Operational history==
&quot;Moray&quot; departed Philadelphia 31 January 1945, arriving New London, Connecticut, 1 February (The Moray accidentally rammed a coal barge Annapolis; there were no deaths.). After shakedown training there and off Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Moray&quot; left New London with and 14 April for Balboa, Panama, C.Z., arriving 25 April. Underway 5 May, &quot;Moray&quot; arrived Pearl Harbor 21 May for final training, after which she sailed for the Marianas 7 June, arriving Saipan 20 June.

The submarine cleared Saipan 27 June for her first war patrol as the senior unit of a coordinated attack group including , , , , and . Comdr. Barrows in &quot;Moray&quot; assigned stations when the group reached its patrol area off Tokyo 1 July. The first phase of this patrol centered on lifeguard duty. From 7 July to 9 July &quot;Moray&quot;&#x27;s special mission was service as picketboat southeast of Honshū in preparation for 3rd Fleet bombardment. Then she continued lifeguard operations.

By June 1945, successful American submarine operations had made enemy targets almost nonexistent, and lifeguard duty became a vital mission for American submarines. However, &quot;Moray&quot; did get a chance at some action, when she and attacked a convoy off Kinkazan, Honshū, 10 July. Allowing &quot;Kingfish&quot; to attack first, &quot;Moray&quot; then moved in to fire six torpedoes, then pulled out to rearm and permit &quot;Kingfish&quot; a second stab. A few moments later one of &quot;Moray&quot;&#x27;s torpedoes hit a whaler &quot;Fumi Maru No.6&quot; {361 GRT}. No other shipping was sighted; on 16 July the patrol was shifted to the Kurile Islands. &quot;Moray&quot; completed her patrol at Midway 6 August 1945.

On 1 September 1945 &quot;Moray&quot; departed for the United States West Coast, arriving San Francisco, California, 11 September. She then went into deactivation overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard. She decommissioned 12 April 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet in January 1947. She was redesignated an &quot;auxiliary research submarine&quot; (AGSS-300) on 1 December 1962. She was struck from the Navy List 1 April 1967 and sunk as a torpedo target on 18 June 1970 off San Clemente, California.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Moray&quot; received one battle star for World War II service.

The road began and ended at the Cherry Valley Turnpike, part of the Great Western Turnpike system, and largely paralleled the Cherry Valley Turnpike between Skaneateles and Richfield Springs. Most of the road is now county-maintained, but a handful of sections are now part of New York state touring routes.

==Route description==
The Skaneateles Turnpike began at the Cherry Valley Turnpike in the hamlet of Clintonville, that at that time had a tavern and a large barn for the stagecoach horses, located about east of the village of Skaneateles in western Onondaga County. West of this point, the Cherry Valley Turnpike served Skaneateles and eventually connected to the Seneca Turnpike. The Skaneateles Turnpike headed generally southeastward from Clintonville, running along part of Otisco Lake before leaving the lake shore and taking a more easterly routing toward the village of Tully. From Tully, the road took on a slightly northeasterly alignment for , passing through Fabius, New Woodstock, and Erieville on its way to Eaton.

At Eaton, the turnpike veered southeast to serve Hamilton before curving back to the northeast at East Hamilton. The remaining of the turnpike served only a handful of small hamlets, scattered across sparsely populated areas of modern Madison and Otsego counties. The largest of these were Brookfield in eastern Madison County and Leonardsville, a riverside community located just south of where the road crossed the Unadilla River. Past the river, the turnpike continued generally northeastward across the rural northwestern corner of Otsego County to the village of Richfield Springs, where it ended at the Cherry Valley Turnpike in the village center.

==History==
The Skaneateles Turnpike was incorporated under the name &quot;the President and Directors of the Hamilton and Scaneatelas Turnpike&quot; on April 2, 1806. In 1807 the company was authorized to intersect the Great Western Turnpike (now U.S. Route 20) at any point east of the west branch of the Unadilla River. The connection was ultimately made at Richfield Springs.

In western Onondaga County, the turnpike is now New York State Route 174 (NY 174), County Route 124 (CR 124), and CR 23. From CR 23&#x27;s east end in Tully to West Woodstock, Madison County, it is now NY 80. While NY 80 follows NY 13 south from West Woodstock, the turnpike&#x27;s path heads east to West Eaton as CR 52. Here, NY 26 joins the road, only to leave to the east in Eaton. Between Eaton and Hamilton, the old road is Hamilton Hill Road and Eaton Street (CR 85). The remainder of the Skaneateles Turnpike between Hamilton and the Unadilla River is part of CR 70 and all of CR 72, CR 74, and CR 80. Across the river in Otsego County, the turnpike is now part of CR 21 and CR 25. A section between the two roads is locally maintained.

While most of the old turnpike is now known by other names, several sections still reference the turnpike in their road name. In Otsego County, CR 25 is named Old Skaneateles Turnpike while CR 21 and the town-maintained segment between CR 21 and CR 25 are named Skaneateles Turnpike. The turnpike&#x27;s old name is also used for CR 80 in Madison County.

<text>Michael Frederick Carrington Radcliffe (born December 16, 1944) is a lawyer and former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1995 to 1999, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Premier Gary Filmon from 1997 to 1999.

The son of Leslie Radcliffe and Edith Bole, he was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and an LL.B. from the University of Manitoba. From 1970 to 1996, he was a partner in the firm of &quot;Baker, Radcliffe, Murray, Kovnats&quot;. Radcliffe was involved in Freemasonry but is now the Grand Knight for the St. Ignatius Church council (#5808) of the Knights of Columbus. In 1974, he married Linda Anne Leach.

In 1912, Radcliffe&#x27;s father was planning to travel on what turned out to be the only voyage of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; with his uncle Charles Sedgwick and aunt Adelaide, who were on their way to Mexico City. In the end, because of concerns about safety related to the Mexican Revolution, Charles made the voyage alone; his body was never found.

In the Canadian general election of 1993, Radcliffe ran as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party in the riding of Winnipeg South Centre. The riding was represented by Lloyd Axworthy MP at the time, and was considered safe for the Liberal Party; Radcliffe came in third with only 3,878 votes, against Axworthy&#x27;s 25,667.

In the provincial election of 1995, Radcliffe ran as a Progressive Conservative in the upscale west-end Winnipeg riding of River Heights, which contained much of the territory represented federally by Winnipeg South Centre. He was successful on this occasion, defeating Liberal Anita Neville (later the MP for Winnipeg South Centre from 2000 to 2011) by 994 votes. He flipped the seat from Liberal to PC, as the former Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs had resigned to accept an appointment to the Senate of Canada.

On January 6, 1997, Gary Filmon, the premier of Manitoba, appointed Radcliffe to the Executive Council of Manitoba, as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs with responsibility for the Gaming Control Act. On February 5, 1999, he became the province&#x27;s Minister of Labour, with responsibility for the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Civil Service Special Supplementary Severance Benefits Act (1983), the Public Servants Insurance Act and the Workers Compensation Act.

Filmon&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives lost government to the New Democratic Party under Gary Doer in the provincial election of 1999. The NDP did not have a strong base in River Heights, and Radcliffe would probably have been re-elected under normal circumstances. However, provincial Liberal leader Jon Gerrard decided to contest the riding. Although the Liberals as a whole ran a poor provincial campaign and lost 10% from their 1995 support level, Gerrard was personally popular enough that he defeated Radcliffe by 465 votes.

Radcliffe attempted to defeat Gerrard in a rematch in the 2003 provincial election but lost by almost 2,000 votes.

In 2004, Radcliffe was the official campaign agent for Raj Joshi, Conservative candidate in Winnipeg South Centre.

<text>The British Rail Class 311 alternating current (AC) electric multiple units (EMU) were built by Cravens at Sheffield from 1966 to 1967. They were intended for use on the line from to and , which was electrified in 1967.

==Appearance==
Outwardly, the units were virtually identical to the earlier Class 303 units built in 1960. The interiors were also very similar, including the panoramic full forward passenger view through the glass-walled driving cabs, although the Class 311 had fluorescent lighting instead of the tungsten filament bulbs used on the Class 303. The Class 303 units had been built by the Pressed Steel Company at their factory in Linwood, Paisley, but by the time the Class 311 was required, Pressed Steel no longer built railway carriages, so Cravens of Sheffield worked from the same original drawings, updated at a few points, to build the new trains.

Along with the Class 303, the wrap-around driving cab windows were replaced with flat, toughened glass in the 1970s to give better protection to drivers in the event of attacks by stone-throwing vandals.

==Construction==
19 units were built, initially classified as AM11 units, and numbered 092-110, the numbers following on from the Class 303. This was later changed to Class 311 under the TOPS system, and the units were renumbered 311092-110. Each unit was formed of three carriages; two outer driving trailers and an intermediate motor coach. The technical description of the formation was BDTSO+MBSO+DTSO. Individual carriages were numbered as follows:
*76403-76421 – DTSO
*62163-62181 – MBSO
*76422-76440 – BDTSO

==Operations==
The units were built to operate services on the newly electrified routes from to and to ; now known as the Inverclyde Line.

In practice, the Class 311 operated almost interchangeably with the Class 303 and could be found in service across the Glasgow electrified suburban network.

Consideration was given to upgrading 11 of the units for use on the newly electrified Ayrshire Coast Line, but it was found to be cheaper to buy new units in the form of the Class 318 and the plan was cancelled.

==Withdrawal==
Being a much smaller and unrefurbished fleet, the Class 311 was withdrawn much earlier than the Class 303, being replaced by the new Class 320 in 1990.

After being withdrawn from normal traffic, two units, 311103/104 were transferred to departmental duties as Class 936 sandite units, numbered 936103/104. These lasted in service until 1999, when they were withdrawn. They were not immediately scrapped as Railtrack was anxious to ensure that one of the units was preserved. In 2002, Railtrack donated one of the units to the Summerlee Heritage Park museum in Coatbridge, and the other was scrapped in 2003.

One of the driving coaches on the unit donated to Summerlee was scrapped in 2006.

==Preservation==

*311103 - 76414+62174+76433 - Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Life, Coatbridge (76414 since scrapped)
This unit was the former Class 936 sandite unit 936103, formed of 977844+977845+977846.

In February 2017, work finally started on restoring the unit to its original condition.

<doc id="1112952" wikidata="Q694831" url="?curid=1112952" title="Privilegium Maius">
<text>The Privilegium maius ( &#x27;greater privilege&#x27;) was a set of medieval documents forged in 1358 or 1359 at the behest of Duke Rudolf IV of Austria (1358–65) of the House of Habsburg. It was essentially a modified version of the &quot;Privilegium minus&quot; issued by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1156, which had elevated the former March of Austria into a duchy. In a similar way, the &quot;Privilegium maius&quot; elevated the duchy into an Archduchy of Austria.

The privileges described in the documents had great influence on the Austrian political landscape, and created a unique connection between the House of Habsburg and Austria.

==Background==
The House of Habsburg had gained rulership of the Duchy of Austria in 1282. Rudolf IV attempted to restore the Habsburg influence on the European political scene by trying to build relations with Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg and increasing the respect of the Austrian rulers. However, Rudolf IV did not belong to the seven Prince-electors, who—as dictated by the Golden Bull of 1356—had the power to choose the king. In the same way Charles IV had made Prague the center of his rule, Rudolf did the same for Vienna, giving it special privileges, launching construction projects and founding the University of Vienna. All this aimed at increasing the legitimacy and influence of the House and its Austrian lands. For this purpose, in the winter of 1358/1359, Rudolf IV ordered the creation of a forged document called &quot;Privilegium maius&quot; (&quot;the greater privilege&quot;).

==Document==
The &quot;Privilegium maius&quot; consists of five forged deeds, some of which purported to have been issued by Julius Caesar and Nero to the historic Roman province of Noricum, which was roughly coterminous with the modern Austrian borders. Though purposefully modeled on the &quot;Privilegium minus&quot;, the original of which &quot;got lost&quot; at the same time, the bundle was already identified as a fake by contemporaries such as the Italian scholar Petrarch.

In the &quot;Privilegium maius&quot;, Rudolf IV declared Austria an &quot;archduchy&quot;, endowed with rights similar to those of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire such as: 

* inseparability of the territory
* automatic inheritance of the first-born (primogeniture), later extended to female heirs in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 in favour of Archduchess Maria Theresa
* independent jurisdiction and legislature, without any possibility to appeal to the Emperor (&quot;privilegium de non evocando&quot;)
* permission to display certain symbols of rule

Rudolf also created the title &quot;Pfalzerzherzog&quot; (&quot;Archduke Palatine&quot;), similar to the Elector Palatine of the Rhine, the holder of an electoral vote. The first Habsburg ruler who actually used the title of an archduke was Ernest of Iron, ruler of Inner Austria from 1406 to 1424. From the 15th century onward, all princes of the Habsburg dynasty were called &quot;Erzherzöge&quot;.

==Effects==
Emperor Charles IV refused to confirm the &quot;Privilegium maius&quot;, although he accepted some claims. The discoverer of the forgery was his advisor, the poet and scholar Petrarch. However, Frederick III, of the House of Habsburg, who became Holy Roman Emperor, 1452, confirmed the document and made it part of imperial law, thus making fiction into fact. From then on, the status as claimed by the document became widely accepted. Frederick also extended the &quot;Privilegium Maius&quot; by granting the power of ennoblement for his family as hereditary rulers of Austria (this power was normally reserved for the emperor). Thus, the act of confirmation by Frederick was what elevated the House of Habsburg to a special rank within the Empire.

The &quot;Privilegium maius&quot; had great influence on the Austrian political landscape. The Habsburg archduke arrogated an almost king-like position, and demonstrated this to outsiders through the usage of special insignia. The Habsburgs gained a new foundation for their rule in these lands; in a way, the House of Habsburg and Austria became a single unit. The family subsequently published special editions of the documents, and forbade all discussion of their authenticity.

With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the &quot;Privilegium maius&quot; finally lost its meaning. In 1852, it was proven a forgery by historian Wilhelm Wattenbach.
