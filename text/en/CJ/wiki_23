<text>Fionán Lynch (; 17 March 1889 – 3 June 1966) was an Irish revolutionary, barrister, politician and judge of the Circuit Court from 1944 to 1959, Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1938 to 1939, Minister for Lands and Fisheries from 1928 to 1932, Minister for Fisheries from 1922 to 1928, Minister without portfolio from August 1922 to December 1922 and Minister for Education from April 1922 to August 1922. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1944.

==Early life==
Lynch was born on 17 March 1889 in Cahersiveen, County Kerry. He was the seventh of eleven children to his parents Finian Lynch and Ellie McCarthy, the master and mistress of the new national school in the townland of Kilmakerrin, near Cahersiveen, in County Kerry.

His father, Finian Lynch, was the younger son of Partalan Lynch, a stonemason, farmer and hedge school teacher, who had purchased some land from the O’Connell estate at Kenneigh in Kerry, between Cahersiveen and Waterville on the Ballinskelligs side of the road and north of the river Inny. His elder brother became a stonemason but Finian trained as a teacher in Dublin. His mother, Ellie McCarthy was the daughter of the teachers in the national school at Spunkane, near Waterville. She was born in 1853 and went to Dublin to train as a teacher.

==Education==
He grew up bilingual, speaking mostly in Irish at home, but in English at school. He was initially educated in the parent&#x27;s school in Kilmakerrin but subsequently went to St Brendan&#x27;s College, Killarney and then, at the age of 14 in about September 1903, to the Holy Ghost Fathers School at Rockwell College, County Tipperary. In 1907, he finished for one year with the Holy Ghost Fathers in Blackrock College, Dublin. He had planned to study medicine, but in 1907, when he was 18 years old his father died and he did not have the money to pursue this career path.

Instead, when he was 18, he went to Swansea in Wales and taught in a parish school, not as a trained teacher, but as a well-educated young man, before returning to Ireland in 1909, where he started training as a teacher in St Patrick&#x27;s College, Dublin. He graduated in 1911 as a primary school teacher and took up a teaching position in Dublin in April 1912, in St. Michan&#x27;s School, Halston Street near North King Street, Dublin, by chance, within the area of his activity in 1916.

==Munster Hotel==

While in training he met and became a lifelong friend of Gearóid O&#x27;Sullivan, a fellow student from Skibbereen, County Cork. Both having got jobs in Dublin, they arranged to stay at the Munster Hotel (also known as &quot;Grianan na nGaedheal&quot; or &quot;Aras na nGael&quot;), 44 Mountjoy Street, Dublin, the hotel and lodgings run by his aunt Miss Myra McCarthy.

This address would later become well known because Michael Collins, a first cousin of Gearóid O&#x27;Sullivan, stayed there after his release from Frongoch internment camp in December 1916 sharing a room with Lynch, with it remaining his base until 1922. Even after Collins went on the run he would still call in for breakfast and to collect his laundry. According to Lynch it was probably the most raided house in Dublin during 1920. During 1918, the British spy Timothy Quinlisk stayed.

==Gaelic League==
While in Swansea, and keen on fostering the Irish language both written and spoken, Lynch had formed a branch of the Gaelic League. When he returned to Dublin in 1912 Lynch, Gearóid O&#x27;Sullivan and his friend Diarmuid O&#x27;Hegarty joined the very active and influential Keating Branch of the Gaelic League, where IRB influence was strong. The chair of the branch was Cathal Brugha and Piaras Béaslaí was a member, with Seán Mac Diarmada a frequent visitor. Lynch, O&#x27;Sullivan and Ó Hegarty were soon brought onto the committee of the branch and undertook teaching of both adults and children.

Lynch proceeded to the Royal University of Ireland and University College Dublin, where he got a BA in Celtic studies in 1913 and a Higher Diploma in Education in 1914. He had a story about his BA in Celtic studies whereby the university was short of an examiner fluent in the Irish language and sought the help, probably of the Gaelic league. He was registered as a student as Finian Lynch, the anglicised version of his name, and the recommendation from the Gaelic league for a suitable examiner was one Fionán Ó Loingsigh.

==&quot;Na hAisteoirí&quot; dramatic society==
Piaras Béaslaí established a dramatic society which was called &quot;Na hAisteoirí&quot; (The Actors) and all three joined. They undertook plays around the country at social events such as the Oireachtas. Lynch translated Molière&#x27;s “Le Maladie Imaginaire” into the Irish language for the purpose.

During 1914 to 1915, they produced plays in Irish at intervals in Dublin and in the summer of 1914 they did a tour of Cork and Kerry producing plays in different towns each night and finishing off with two or three nights at the Oireachtas in Killarney. In July 1914, they were producing Irish plays at the Oireachtas in Drogheda and Seán Mac Diarmada insisted that they go ahead even though it clashed with the Howth gun running.

==Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood==
On 25 November 1913, Lynch, together with Gearóid O&#x27;Sullivan and Diarmuid O&#x27;Hegarty attended the meeting at the Rotunda Rink for the founding of the Irish Volunteers and they joined on that first night. Drilling started within a couple of weeks, at the Foresters Hall on Parnell Square (Russell Square at the time) and instructors were chosen and Lynch was chosen to train a squad. In summer 1914, there was the first election of volunteer officers and Lynch was elected 2nd lieutenant of F Company, which would be placed in 1st Battalion.

With the formation of the battalion the captain of F Company, Piaras Béaslaí, was promoted to second in command of the battalion and, as Sean (Jack) Shouldice who was the first lieutenant couldn&#x27;t accept the captaincy, Lynch was promoted to captain of F Company. His friend from the Gaelic League Diarmuid Ó Hegarty was made second lieutenant.

Soon after this he was asked by his close friend Seán Mac Diarmada, along with Con Collins, to join the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The IRB supreme Council were trying to ensure volunteer officers were members of the brotherhood and the fact that he was already friendly with Seán MacDiarmada made him acceptable. He subsequently took the oath and was sworn in around spring 1915. He was allocated to the Circle in Gardiner Street, with Diarmuid Ó Hegarty and Gearoid O&#x27;Sullivan members of the same circle.

From late 1914, Lynch and the other members of the Irish Volunteers came under observation by the Dublin Metropolitan Police. At the time, Lynch was an assistant teacher in St. Michan&#x27;s School, and at the beginning of 1916 the Commissioners of National Education notified the school that his activities were not compatible with his teaching duties. Lynch&#x27;s schoolmaster told him that his salary would be withdrawn if he continued his involvement to which Lynch surprised him by replying that he would consult with his superior officers about it. He did so and was ordered by Tom McDonagh to lie low and formally sever his connections with the Volunteers. However, during this time he organised a Sunday morning training squad centre at the headquarters of the Gaelic League, 25 Parnell Square, for members whose positions made it impossible for them to be openly associated with the Volunteers.

However, he continued to attend the meetings of the battalion council, where he was told which area would be occupied by his company at the forthcoming rising.

==1916 Easter Rising==

Lynch fought in the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916 in the Four Courts garrison with Commandant Edward Daly in North King Street.

On Holy Thursday he again went to the formation parade and re-took formal command of F Company. He was greeted back with cheers and excitement having previously told his men that he would be back to lead them when there was ‘anything doing’.
On Easter Sunday Lynch and Gearoid O&#x27;Sullivan were at early Mass and got the Sunday Independent with the countermanding order and brought the bad news to Seán McDermott. The leaders were alerted, Lynch collecting Patrick Pearce from his home at Saint Enda&#x27;s and a series of meetings were held through the day to late evening at Liberty Hall.

The decision to proceed with the Easter Rising having been taken, the First Battalion mobilised in Blackhall Place on the morning of Easter Monday under the command of Commandant Ned Daly. Lynch was stationed in North King Street, adjacent to the Four Courts, having previously reconnoitred the area on Good Friday, they were rapidly able to occupy their chosen houses, create barricades and arrange food supplies in line with their original plans. F Company occupied the area from North King St. along Church St. to May Lane where it was joined to C Company which held the Four Courts.

There was little fighting in the area until the Wednesday 26 April, from which point the fighting was intense, especially along North King Street, until the order for surrender on the Saturday. His final engagement was on Saturday afternoon at the barricade on the May Lane side of the Franciscan Church, during which Seán Hurley was fatally wounded.

Lynch and his men, who were worn out from fighting, retreated to the Four Courts on Saturday evening where they received the order to surrender shortly afterwards.

Lynch, describing the valour of his men said: &quot;I shall merely say that it was a great honour for any man to be their captain. As to how they fought, the words of our enemies at the time are the greatest tribute we could call for&quot;. General Sir John Maxwell said of North King Street: &quot;With the one exception of the place at Ballsbridge, where the Sherwood Foresters were ambushed, this was by far the worst fighting that occurred in the whole of Dublin. At first the troops, coming from one end of the street, were repulsed. And it was only when we made an attack from both sides that we succeeded, after twenty-four hours fighting, in capturing the street. The casualties were very heavy during this fighting&quot;.

After the surrender Lynch was sent to Kilmainham Gaol, where, on 4 May 1916, Captain Lynch was tried by Field General Court martial, sentenced to death but immediately had his sentence commuted to 10 years penal servitude. He was transferred to Mountjoy Prison and then spent a period in Portland Jail, on Portland Isle off the Dorset coast, after which he was transferred to Lewis Prison. He was released in June 1917 with the other Irish prisoners under the general amnesty.

==1917–1918==
On his release in June 1917, his re‐employment was refused. He became an organiser for the Volunteer Executive, working in South Kerry, Armagh and Offaly, militarily as well as politically for Sinn Féin. He continued to preach about the benefits of Ireland becoming a republic and was soon drafted to East Clare for electioneering in the hugely significant campaign for the July 1917 East Clare by-election where Éamon de Valera, for Sinn Féin, beat the Irish Parliamentary Party candidate.

He attended the first Roger Casement Commemoration in Banna Strand, County Kerry, on 11 August 1917 where he gave a speech along with Thomas Ashe and Austin Stack before a crowd of 12,000.

Lynch was arrested on 13 August 1917 along with Thomas Ashe and Austin Stack under the charge of making seditious speeches and wearing the Volunteer uniform. They were each sentenced to two years’ jail and ended up in Mountjoy Prison, being treated as common criminals. With a few other republicans, they undertook a hunger strike. Unfortunately, this had a tragic outcome when, in September 1917, Thomas Ashe died after food was fed into his lungs during forced feeding. Lynch, returning from his own forced feeding had said to Ashe as they crossed paths ‘Stick it Tom boy’ to which he replied ‘I’ll stick it Fin’. Fionán Lynch records the fact that he was the last person to speak to Ashe before his death, as these were Ashe&#x27;s last words.

The prisoners were released in November 1917, but Lynch was re‐arrested on 18 May 1918, along with most of those previously released on licence, this time the reason given was a ‘German Plot’.

==First Dáil and War of Independence (1918–1921)==
In December 1918, Lynch stood as a candidate in the United Kingdom general election, being elected unopposed as an abstentionist Sinn Féin MP for Kerry South, becoming a Member of the 1st Dáil. Apparently his candidature was a surprise as, being imprisoned, Lynch had not been available to sign his assent to his nomination which had been done for him by Michael Collins, without troubling to notify his friend that he had done so. Sinn Féin won an overwhelming majority in Ireland at the 1918 Westminster election, but did not take up their seats in Westminster in protest. The parliament met in Dublin in January 1919, but Lynch, along with many other members, was unable to attend being imprisoned at the time.

In April 1919, Lynch was transferred to Strangeways Prison, Manchester as a political prisoner. He was released from Manchester Jail “time served”, again while on hunger strike, on 19 August 1919, and was met upon release by Paddy O&#x27;Donoghue, who passed onto him orders from Michael Collins. Lynch pointed out areas of the prison that were weakly guarded inside, including counting the number of bricks in the walls to estimate the height for the rope ladders. This led to the successful escape of the remaining political prisoners eight weeks later, including Austin Stack and Stack&#x27;s father.

As TD for Kerry South he spent much time in the county on parliamentary and paramilitary activities. Many meetings were held in Tralee, in the premises of Thomas Slattery an active republican in his hometown who figured prominently in the movement.

In November 1919, Lynch married Bridget Slattery, daughter of Tom Slattery, having met at a republican meeting hosted by Tom Slattery in August 1917. After the marriage, which was conducted by his brother, Father John Lynch, he and Bridget got a flat at 98 Pembroke Road, Dublin leaving 44 Mountjoy Street.

After September 1919 the Dáil was declared illegal following which it met rarely, but its cabinet held meetings in various different locations across the city of Dublin, overseeing the guerrilla war that was being fought at that time against the British. He and Bridget hosted some of these cabinet meetings at their flat on Pembroke Road. He was appointed to the GHQ Staff of the IRA as assistant director of organisation under Diarmaid Ó Heigeartaigh in early 1920.

Around this time Lynch set up an insurance business and worked part-time as an organiser until his re‐arrest on 8 January 1921. He was interned in Ballykinlar internment Camp in County Down, where he was when his father in law died, and was released with the other TDs on 12 August 1921 to attend a meeting of the Dáil in Dublin on 16 August 1921. His business collapsed as a result of his internment.

==Second Dáil and Anglo-Irish Treaty==
In the May 1921 elections, Lynch was re-elected as an abstentionist member of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and a Member of the 2nd Dáil as a Sinn Féin TD for Kerry–Limerick West at the 1921 elections.

In October 1921, he was a member of the delegation that went to London to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty with the UK, serving as joint secretary.

He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty like almost all IRB members and during the Dáil Debates criticised some Anti-Treaty TDs. Lynch believed the Treaty to be the practical solution, arguing for it in the Dáil debates, saying that 

Under the terms of the Treaty a Provisional Government was established in January 1922, with the task of overseeing the implementation of the Treaty and to be dissolved on 5 December 1922, one year after the signing of the treaty.

His position in this government from April 1922 to August 1922 was Minister for Education. This overlapped with the cabinet of the third Dáil and Lynch came to a pragmatic arrangement with Michael Hayes, the other Minister for Education at that time, whereby roles were divided between them, with Lynch taking responsibility for primary education. Lynch had the task of dissolving the education board which had sacked him from his teaching job after the Easter Rising.

==Irish Civil War (1922–1923) and Third Dáil==
Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Treaty had to be ratified by popular vote and the Second Dáil had decided that the 16 June 1922 general election, campaigned on the Treaty, would be that ratification. By April, there were increasing clashes between government troops and irregulars and, in late April, Lynch attended public rallies with Michael Collins in Killarney and Tralee to argue for the Treaty, despite significant harassment from anti-treaty activists.

Sinn Féin knew that the June election would split the party and in an effort to retain unity a Pact was drawn up in May 1922 under which it was agreed that both Pro and Anti-Treaty TDs would form a coalition government. The outcome of June 1922 election was strongly in favour of acceptance of the Treaty, both in the number of Pro-Treaty TDs elected and the votes cast.

However, there were continuing disagreements about the Anglo-Irish Treaty, combined with many acts of aggression against treaty supporters as well as National Forces leading ultimately to the civil war, with the shelling of the Four Courts on 28 June 1922 being a significant watershed moment.

During the Civil War he fought with the Irish National Army and rose to the rank of Brigadier-General. He enlisted in the National Army at Portobello Barracks on 12 July 1922, as a General Staff Officer in the General Headquarters Staff. By mid-summer the major cities were under government control and the Irregulars were concentrated in the rural areas of the province of Munster, particularly in the counties of Tipperary, Cork, and Kerry.

In July 1922, with the sub-division of the original military districts, Lynch was appointed by Collins a vice commandant of the South Western Division with the rank of commandant-general, commanding a unit of Dublin soldiers in County Kerry. He served in that appointment under General Eoin O&#x27;Duffy, General Officer Commanding the Division, up to 13 December 1922. He undertook trips to his constituency in Kerry and the rest of the county but the population of the county was heavily anti treaty and there was considerable danger. On occasion he had to endure being ambushed and, during one ambush, he was hit on a metal cigarette case which saved his life.

In August 1922, he travelled by car with Michael Collins as far as Limerick, where Lynch headed for his constituency of Kerry and Collins for Cork, but on 22 August 1922 Collins was ambushed and assassinated.

On Friday, 25 August 1922, Lynch, in command of a large force of Dublin Guards, set out for Kenmare to relieve and strengthen the garrison that had been established earlier in the month by Tom O’Connor-Scarteen. The geography meant that the Kenmare could only be supplied by sea and a land link was necessary. As Lynch&#x27;s column advanced along the Killarney-Kilgarvan road it came under fire from anti-treaty forces at Filadown, near Glenflesk. This brought an ironic comment to Lynch, TD for the area, that his constituents did not seem to think much of him. As night fell, and following a number of wounded, the Free State column retreated, returning to the area the next day.

He was elected to the 3rd Dáil at the 1922 general election as a Pro-Treaty Sinn Féin TD and on 9 September 1922, Lynch was appointed as a Minister without Portfolio in the government of the Third Dáil, being unavailable for immediate service in the Government as he remained on active service.

On 5 December, legislation adopted by the Westminster parliament approved both the Free State Constitution and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of a year before, satisfying the British insistence that the Free State be based on constitutionalism and legislation rather than violence. On 14 December 1922, with the dissolution of the Provisional Government, Lynch became Minister for Fisheries in the Free State Government of W. T. Cosgrave.

On 6 December 1922, the day the Irish Free State came into being, two members of its legislature were shot by the Irregulars, one of whom, Seán Hales, was killed, as part of a retaliatory policy for the military court executions that had started a few weeks earlier.

Following the execution of the Four Courts IRA members, a threat was published that all pro-treaty TDs were legitimate targets for assassination.

However, the reluctance of former colleagues to attack him may have ensured his survival during the war – Frank Henderson of Dublin&#x27;s No. 1 brigade of the IRA told Ernie O&#x27;Malley of his reluctance to become involved in reprisal shootings after Free State executions, commenting: ‘I didn&#x27;t like that order. I could have shot Eamon Duggan and Fionán Lynch, for they went home every night drunk, but I left them alone.’ Although the civil war ended in 1923, Lynch was provided with an armed guard as late as 1932, because of the ongoing threat of assassination.

==Later life==
The Military Service Pensions Act of 1924 aided post-Civil War reconciliation and, from October 1924 until October 1928, Lynch acted as a member of the Board of Assessors for the adjudication of military service pensions, along with Eamonn Duggan and Gearóid O&#x27;Sullivan acting as Secretary.

Lynch was re-elected at each subsequent general election as a Cumann na nGaedheal and later Fine Gael TD for the constituencies of Kerry from 1923 to 1937 and Kerry South from 1937 until 1944. Lynch served as Minister for Education from April to August 1922, as Minister for Fisheries from 1922 to 1928, and as Minister for Land and Fisheries from 1928 to 1932.

In 1932, he was re-elected to his constituency of Kerry but the government was defeated by Éamon de Valera&#x27;s Fianna Fáil. He had been called to the Irish Bar in 1930 and practised as a barrister in the Irish Midlands Circuit.

He managed to remain friendly with members of both sides and in 1937 he suffered a very severe heart attack. For the 1938 election he was unfit to canvas or undertake electioneering. The parties agreed to put forward only the number of candidates for which there were seats and he was elected unopposed. In 1938, he was appointed Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy chairperson) of Dáil Éireann but suffered serious illness and relinquished the post in May 1939. He continued as a TD until 1944.

Having built up a legal practice, he retired from politics in October 1944 when he was appointed a Judge of the Circuit Court, in Sligo and Donegal Circuit Court by his old adversary Éamon de Valera. Despite their differences on the Treaty, they remained good friends and de Valera attended his funeral in June 1966.

He retired from the bench in 1959.

==Family==
He married Bridget Slattery on 26 November 1919. Bridget was the daughter of Tom Slattery of Rock Street, Tralee. They had six boys and one girl; with one son predeceasing him.

Tom Lynch qualified in medicine and practiced psychiatry and was Professor of Psychiatry at the Royal College of Surgeons, St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dublin. Kevin Lynch qualified in arts and was called to the Irish bar, and finished his career as a Judge of the Supreme Court.

Fionán Lynch died at his home in Dartry, Dublin, on 3 June 1966, aged 77, shortly after celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. He was survived by his wife, and their five sons and one daughter. His papers are on permanent loan to Kerry County Library archives.

<text>Zaireeka is the eighth studio album by the American rock band the Flaming Lips, released on October 28, 1997, by Warner Bros. Records. It consists of four CDs designed so that when played simultaneously on four separate audio systems, they would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound; the discs could also be played in different combinations, omitting one, two or three discs. Each of its eight songs consists of four stereo tracks, one from each CD.

The album&#x27;s title is a portmanteau of two words. &quot;Zaire&quot; was chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the nation&#x27;s political instability. The word &quot;Eureka&quot; (literally: &quot;I have found it&quot;) was selected, an expression of joyous discovery.

&quot;Zaireeka&quot; was the first album by the band after the departure of guitarist Ronald Jones. It acted as a preview of the music and style that would surface on the next album &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; (1999), which was recorded during the same sessions as &quot;Zaireeka&quot;, and is the predecessor to the band&#x27;s more conventional surround sound releases.

==Background==
Adverse circumstances led to the production of &quot;Zaireeka&quot;. The departure of guitarist Ronald Jones compelled the band to change fundamentally. In addition, the limited success of the previous album, &quot;Clouds Taste Metallic&quot;, threatened their status at Warner Bros. Records. They eventually found that drummer Steven Drozd could compensate for the loss of Jones by becoming a multi-instrumentalist. However, live shows proved to be more challenging and in order to maintain activity and output, Wayne Coyne conceived an experimental show.

===The Parking Lot Experiments===
During 1996 and 1997, the Flaming Lips ran a series of events known as &quot;The Parking Lot Experiments&quot;. The concept was inspired by an incident in Coyne&#x27;s youth, where he noticed that car radios in the parking lot at a concert were playing the same songs at the same time, Wayne Coyne created 40 cassette tapes to be played in synchronization. The band invited people to bring their cars to parking lots, where they would be given one of the tapes and then instructed when to start them. The music was &quot;a strange, fluid 20 minute sound composition&quot;.

===Production===
Production of the album was preceded by two unfortunate events, which were recounted in &quot;The Spiderbite Song&quot; from &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;. Michael Ivins was involved in a car crash, and Steven Drozd&#x27;s hand became severely infected. Drozd initially claimed that his hand had been bitten by a spider, although later he admitted the infected abscess was caused by injection of heroin.

The Flaming Lips began work on &quot;Zaireeka&quot; in April 1997 in the then-new Tarbox Road Studios. Initially, the band was frustrated while making the album. Even after diverting half of the budget for the next album into &quot;Zaireeka&quot;, there were no tangible results. The band experienced difficulty writing songs for the album. Finally, Coyne exclaimed, &quot;Look, we don&#x27;t have to be friends... but we have to make this record!&quot; While this philosophy aided progress, the band only began to complete songs when they learned to write &quot;for&quot; the medium as opposed to trying to split normal songs across four CDs.

The group wrote several songs that were unsuccessful in the four-CD format. These songs, including &quot;Race for the Prize&quot;, were reserved for the next album, which would eventually become &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;.

===Release===
Warner Bros. Records was initially apprehensive about releasing &quot;Zaireeka&quot;, so manager Scott Booker carefully researched the costs of releasing a box set. Booker discovered that &quot;Zaireeka&quot; could be released so that once 12,000 copies had been sold, the label would break even. (Advance orders for the album came to 14,000 copies.) Booker pitched the album to Warner Bros. Records president Steven Baker.

Eventually, the two factions reached an agreement in which the album would be released, although &quot;Zaireeka&quot; would not count towards the seven albums the band was contracted to deliver to Warner Bros. For an advance of $200,000, the band would make both &quot;Zaireeka&quot; and &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;. In addition, Booker mentioned that by allowing the media to proclaim how &quot;weird&quot; the band was with &quot;Zaireeka&quot;, they would be more prepared to treat &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; as a serious album. &quot;Zaireeka&quot; was released in October, 1997. , 28,000 copies have been sold.

===Logistics of listening===

The speakers being used may be physically positioned in many different configurations (e.g. at different heights or even in entirely different rooms). Some listeners may even choose to disable the left or right speaker of one or more systems. Synchronization errors between the audio systems may cause effects such as reverb or echo being heard on one disc before the original sound is produced from another. Further, the type and quality of each audio system affect the relationship between the four CDs.

===The Boom Box Experiments===
After completion of &quot;Zaireeka&quot;, the Flaming Lips tried an unconventional method to tour the album. &quot;The Boom Box Experiments&quot;, like &quot;The Parking Lot Experiments&quot;, involved tapes being played at the same time. However, these shows were held in conventional rock venues, and the band supplied their own boom boxes. Coyne and Drozd conducted two &quot;choirs&quot; of people controlling the boom boxes, giving them instructions for actions like turning the volume up or down, while Ivins controlled the mixer.

Songs played in The Boom Box Experiments include:
*&quot;The Big Ol&#x27; Bug Is the New Baby Now&quot;
*&quot;A Winter&#x27;s Day Car Accident Melody&quot;
*&quot;Altruism, or That&#x27;s the Crotch Calling the Devil Black&quot;
*&quot;Heralding in a Better Ego&quot;
*&quot;Realizing the Speed of Life&quot;
*&quot;Schizophrenic Sunrise, or The Loudest Blade of Grass&quot;
*&quot;Should We Keep the Severed Head Awake??&quot; (used in both the Parking Lot and Boom Box experiments. Part of it was included on &quot;Sleeping on the Roof&quot; on &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;.)

===Aftermath and legacy===
With &quot;Zaireeka&quot;, the Flaming Lips had overcome the loss of Ronald Jones and proved they could still work as a band. The situation at Warner Bros. Records was still dire, including a risk of being dropped from the label. However, songs had already been written for the next album, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;, which would be both a critical hit for the band and their breakthrough into mainstream success. Following the release of &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; in 2002, the Flaming Lips would return to the concept of surround sound with a DVD-Audio special-edition of that album in 2003.

&quot;Zaireeka&quot; is viewed by the band as nothing more than an experimental release. &quot;It was, and still is, intended to be listened to by other artists, musicians and producers,&quot; Coyne would later state in the liner notes for &quot;The Soft Bulletin 5.1&quot;, adding that they &quot;never expected the less involved members of our audience to care about it.&quot; As noted above, there was no conventional concert tour to promote &quot;Zaireeka&quot;. However, three of its eight songs have been played live. “Riding to Work in the Year 2025 (Your Invisible Now)” and &quot;Thirty-Five Thousand Feet Of Despair&quot; were played on the tour supporting &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; and also on the Lips’ 2007 and 2013 tours, the latter not being part of the later tours and “How Will We Know? (Futuristic Crashendos)” was played albeit less often during 2000 and 2002.

==Songs==
&quot;Zaireeka&quot; opens with &quot;Okay I&#x27;ll Admit That I Really Don&#x27;t Understand&quot;, a mantra of sorts about the admitted lack of comprehension regarding one&#x27;s situation. The second track, &quot;Riding to Work in the Year 2025 (Your Invisible Now)&quot; [sic] tells a science-fiction story about a man who pretends to be a secret agent in the future and imagines his own psychological demise from the stress &quot;of being the most important secret agent in the world&quot;. &quot;Thirty-Five Thousand Feet of Despair&quot;, the third song, is the tragic story of an airplane pilot who (somehow) hangs himself mid-flight. The next song, &quot;A Machine in India&quot;, is about the &quot;dull and depressing, mild insanity&quot; that the speaker&#x27;s partner slips into during her menstrual cycle. Next, &quot;The Train Runs over the Camel but Is Derailed by the Gnat&quot;, is a speech by a man who is on the verge of discovery, but ends up &quot;talking himself into circles&quot;. Track six, &quot;How Will We Know? (Futuristic Crashendos)&quot;, is based on an urban legend that being exposed to high and low frequencies can cause a person to experience s, and thus contains its infamously extensive frequencies that caused the band to place a warning on the album cover and inside the booklet. The seventh song, &quot;March of the Rotten Vegetables&quot;, is &quot;music for a cartoon about a group of demented vegetables&quot;. The eighth and final song, &quot;The Big Ol&#x27; Bug Is the New Baby Now&quot;, contains a spoken-word story about Coyne&#x27;s dogs; the track ends the album with loud barking from each disc. On the 10th anniversary of &quot;Zaireeka&quot;, Wayne Coyne made and distributed an additional 5th disc to go along with the set.

==Critical reception==

Critical reaction to &quot;Zaireeka&quot; was polarized. Josh Kun of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the album&#x27;s &quot;wall-of-surround-sound approach melds droning-rock dissonance with warped, off-kilter pop melodies, producing a totally immersing post-&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; audio séance.&quot; Jason Ankeny of AllMusic stated that the album would only really be accessible to hardcore Flaming Lips fans, but that &quot;they&#x27;re in for the musical experience of a lifetime&quot;.

Critics who disliked the album cited what they viewed as a ridiculous concept. &quot;Salon&quot; remarked in its review that &quot;Musically [...] their 1995 album &quot;Clouds Taste Metallic&quot; offers the same psychotic results without all the technological hassle. And conceptually? The same thing, just all at once: stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.&quot; Jason Josephes from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10; in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking &quot;Do I want to buy three more CD players with which to enjoy &quot;Zaireeka&quot; or, say, eat?&quot; and derided the band&#x27;s fans. Nonetheless, in June 2002, editor-in-chief of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Mark Richardson published a response to Josephes&#x27; review (which has since been deleted), lauding the album and referring to it as &quot;one of the greatest albums ever recorded&quot;. Richardson writes:

In October 2009, Richardson went on to write a book titled &quot;Zaireeka&quot; for the &quot;33 1/3&quot; book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles the creation of the album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release. The album was included in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s 2010 list of &quot;ten unusual CD-era gimmicks&quot;.

==Other formats==
Wayne Coyne had initially confirmed that &quot;Zaireeka&quot; would eventually be released on DVD format in the vein of the surround-sound special editions of &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;, and &quot;At War with the Mystics&quot;, but it is unlikely to happen due to the deliberately out-of-sync nature of the original multitrack recordings.

In the UK, the &quot;Race for the Prize&quot; and &quot;Waitin&#x27; for a Superman&quot; CD singles were released in 2-disc sets. Each disc of the two sets contained a different version of &quot;Riding to Work in the Year 2025 (Your Invisible Now)&quot; and &quot;Thirty-Five Thousand Feet of Despair&quot;. This marked the first time material from the album would be released in the four-disc format in Europe. The &quot;Waitin&#x27; for a Superman&quot; Maxi-CD, as released in the US, contains stereo mixes of the two songs.

&quot;The Soft Bulletin Companion&quot;, initially a promo-only CD release in 1999 but reissued commercially in 2021, contains the two stereo tracks already made available on the &quot;Waitin&#x27; for a Superman&quot; single in addition to stereo mixes of &quot;A Machine in India,&quot; &quot;Okay I&#x27;ll Admit,&quot; &quot;The Big Ol&#x27; Bug&quot; (as they are titled on the CD).

The album was reissued on vinyl for Record Store Day 2013.

<doc id="1087315" wikidata="Q883307" url="?curid=1087315" title="Bleaklow">
<text>Bleaklow is a high, largely peat-covered, gritstone moorland in the Derbyshire High Peak near the town of Glossop. It is north of Kinder Scout, across the Snake Pass (A57), and south of the A628 Woodhead Pass. Much of it is nearly above sea level and the shallow bowl of Swains Greave on its eastern side is the source of the River Derwent.

Bleaklow Head (633 m), marked by a huge cairn of stones, the high point at the western side of the moor, is a Hewitt and is crossed by the Pennine Way. It is one of three summits on this plateau above 2,000 feet, the others being Bleaklow Stones, some to the east along an indefinite ridge, and Higher Shelf Stones, south of Bleaklow Head. At , Bleaklow is the second-highest point in Derbyshire and the area includes the most easterly point in the British Isles over 2,000 feet, near Bleaklow Stones.

== Description ==
Much of the main plateau of Bleaklow is a boggy peat moorland, seamed by &#x27;groughs&#x27; (pronounced &#x27;gruffs&#x27;, water-eroded channels in the peat) and lacking strong changes in elevation – in poor conditions its traverse is probably the most navigationally challenging in the Peak District.

== Conservation ==
Bleaklow is part of the National Trust&#x27;s High Peak Estate. There has been considerable investment of resources in recent years to block many of the eroded peat gulleys as part of major schemes to re-wet and restore healthy &quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss communities which are essential for peat formation, carbon capture, and reduction in dissolved carbon which contaminates water supplies. Much of this work has been coordinated by the Moors for the Future Partnership, funded by EU LIFE+ programme between 2010 and 2015. This involved laying of geotextiles to stabilise eroded peat, creating 4,000 mini-dams to retain water, introducing 150,000 moorland plants and spreading 807 million &quot;Sphagnum&quot; fragments across the whole Bleaklow Project site.

== Views ==
The summit affords views across Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire to the west and towards the Hope Valley, Holme Moss, Emley Moor and Yorkshire to the east. In exceptional weather conditions it is possible to see Snowdonia in North Wales.

== Aircraft crash ==

There are a number of aircraft crash sites on Bleaklow. On 3 November 1948, USAF Boeing RB-29A Superfortress 44–61999, of the 16th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, 91st Reconnaissance Group, 311th Air Division, Strategic Air Command, crashed at Higher Shelf Stones, Bleaklow (), en route from Scampton to Burtonwood. All 13 crew members were killed. A large amount of wreckage of the Bleaklow Bomber is still visible. A memorial was erected at the site in 1988. There is public access to the area.

<text>Castiglione delle Stiviere (Upper Mantovano: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Mantua, in Lombardy, Italy, northwest of Mantua by road.

==History==
The town&#x27;s castle was home to a cadet branch of the House of Gonzaga, headed by the Marquis of Castiglione. Saint Aloysius Gonzaga (1568–1591) was born there as heir to the marquisate, but became a Jesuit. He died tending plague victims in Rome and was buried there, but his head was later translated to the basilica in Castiglione which bears his name.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, the French under the duc de Vendôme occupied the town. In 1706, in the first Battle of Castiglione a French army under Jacques Eléonor Rouxel de Grancey defeated here a Hessian army led by Frederick I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel.

During the siege of Mantua in 1796, the Austrians under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser were defeated here in the second Battle of Castiglione by the revolutionary French army under General Augereau, later Marshal of France, who in 1808 was created Duke of Castiglione by Emperor Napoleon I, a hereditary victory title (so there never was an actual territorial duchy attached to it) extinguished in 1915.

Castiglione received the honorary title of city by presidential decree on 18 October 2001.

==Main sights==
It has an old castle, much altered and restored, especially by the Gonzaga family of Mantua in the 16th century.

The Fountain of Domenica Calubina is a small hexagonal fountain in the piazza Dallò in the center of the town.

Castiglione is the birthplace of the International Red Cross, which was established by Henri Dunant during the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino in 1859. There is a museum in the center of the town dedicated to the IRC.

==International relations==
Castiglione delle Stiviere is twinned with:
* Barentin, France
* Leutkirch im Allgäu, Germany, since 1995
* Monteprandone, Italy

<text>The Benchmade Knife Company is an American knife manufacturer based out of Oregon City, Oregon. 

== History ==
Benchmade originally started in California in 1979 as Bali-Song, then changed their name to Pacific Cutlery Corporation in the early 1980s, before settling on &quot;Benchmade&quot; in 1988. In 1990, the company moved to Clackamas, Oregon, to be closer to existing knife production companies in that area. As part of the process of moving their production from outside vendors to in-house production facilities, the company moved again in 1996, to their own 35,000 square foot facility in Oregon City, Oregon.

Benchmade became known primarily as a manufacturer of butterfly knives, or balisongs, and they continue to be manufactured under their registered trademark name &quot;Ba“i-Song&quot;. ”Benchmade&#x27;s original Bali-Song design by Jody Samson was awarded &quot;Blade Magazine&#x27;s&quot; Knife of the Year Award in 1979. This connection to butterfly knives is the inspiration for the butterfly symbol in their logo.

Founder Les deAsis died February 21, 2020, following a stroke. His wife Roberta deAsis, took over the position of President and CEO following his death, and was succeeded by their son Jon deAsis in October of 2020.

==Products==
Blade steels such as 154CM, D2, CPM S30V steel, CPM S90V steel, CPM 20CV, N690 and M390 are used on many models. Benchmade also uses high speed M2 and CPM M4 tool steels.

Benchmade receives a significant amount of revenue from selling restricted-sales knives to the military and law enforcement. They produce a diverse selection of &quot;auto&quot;, or switchblade knives, along with a range of hunting, fishing, utility and miscellaneous knives, though balisongs remain a core product. In recent years most balisongs have been discontinued, with the only remaining Balisong in production being the 85. 

Benchmade has three different knife classes. The first class is the Blue Class, also known as the Recreation class. This type of Benchmade knife is made for typical use by the everyday person. The next class is the Black Class, also known as the Professional class. This type of Benchmade knife is made for military, law enforcement, and public safety workers. The last class is the Gold class, also known as the Collector class. This class of Benchmade knife is made for collectors and are limited edition.

Benchmade has a patent on the locking mechanism used in most of the switchblades they produce. Benchmade additionally holds an exclusive license on use of the McHenry / Williams &quot;AXIS Lock&quot;, a spring-operated locking mechanism used in both automatic and manual action models.

The designers are Jody Samson, Ernest Emerson, Allen Elishewitz, Mel Pardue, Bill McHenry, Mike Snody, Jason Williams, Warren Osborne, Ken Steigerwalt, and Bob Lum. Several production Benchmade models based on the work of these designers have become influential within the industry.

Some of the Benchmade knife models include:
*Benchmade Griptilian
*Benchmade Freek
*Benchmade Crooked River
*Benchmade Bushcrafter
*Benchmade Infidel
*Benchmade SOCP
*Benchmade 556 Mini Griptilian

<doc id="1087318" wikidata="Q522757" url="?curid=1087318" title="Slaviša Žungul">
<text>Slaviša Žungul (born 28 July 1954), also known as Steve Zungul, is a retired Yugoslav American soccer striker.

Žungul began his career with Hajduk in his native Yugoslavia before controversially moving to the United States where he became a dominant indoor soccer striker. His indoor career began with the New York Arrows of Major Indoor Soccer League and ended with the San Diego Sockers. His amazing scoring ability earned him the nickname &quot;Lord of All Indoors&quot;. He also spent two seasons playing outdoor soccer with the Golden Bay Earthquakes of the North American Soccer League. In 1984, he was the NASL MVP. He also earned fourteen caps with the Yugoslavia national football team between 1972 and 1976.

==Early life==
Žungul was born Slaviša Ivanović in Požarevac, but his biological father died when he was still an infant. His mother Danica quickly remarried and moved to Kaštel Lukšić near Split, PR Croatia where baby Slaviša was given his stepfather&#x27;s last name.

==Club career==

===Hajduk Split===
When he was sixteen, Žungul began his football career in Split, playing for Hajduk starting in 1972 and continuing until 1978. He led the team in scoring every season and finished his time at Hajduk with 176 goals. During his six years with the team, he led them to three Yugoslav First League titles, in 1974 and 1975 as well as four Yugoslav Cup trophies.

At Hajduk he quickly established himself as the focal point of head coach Tomislav Ivić&#x27;s setup as well as becoming a fan favourite for his off-the-cuff ways and jet-set lifestyle, often seen in bars around the city while dating models, pinups, singers, and pageant contestants. His scoring prowess at Hajduk drew comparisons to Gerd Müller in the Yugoslav press.

By the time he turned 24, Žungul&#x27;s prominence was such that he began receiving lucrative offers from NASL clubs in the United States. However, Yugoslav sporting regulations at the time stipulated that players could not transfer abroad until completing their mandatory Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) stint and turning 28 years of age. In certain cases exemptions were granted so that a player&#x27;s transfer would be allowed in the calendar year during which he&#x27;ll be turning 28 or even a year early, but the completion of the army stint was absolutely mandatory. While twenty-four-year-old Žungul was years away from even considering a move abroad, he was on increasingly bad terms with Hajduk management—led by club president —over unpaid wages. The star player became concerned the club would arrange for him to be sent off to his army service just to further delay the payments they owed him.

On 3 December 1978, Žungul played in Hajduk&#x27;s last league match before the 1978-79 mid-season winter break—a 5–0 home thrashing of FK Sarajevo at the Stari plac Stadium—scoring twice thus increasing his half-season scoring tally to 12 goals. He then asked the club management to allow him to travel to New York City for a few weeks in order to accompany his singer girlfriend Moni Kovačič (famous for appearing in &quot;&quot;, the Yugoslav counterpart to &quot;Playboy&quot;) while further disclosing to them that while in the U.S. he would also be taking part in a few exhibition indoor soccer matches in order to stay in competitive shape for the season restart. Not suspecting anything amiss, Hajduk granted permission.

In actuality, through countryman Dragan Popović, Žungul (represented by sports agent Ante &quot;Bekin&quot; Kuzmić) had already agreed a contract with the newly established, Popović-coached New York Arrows of the also recently launched Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). Žungul&#x27;s idea was to defect from Yugoslavia and play a few years of indoor soccer in the MISL, then switch over to &quot;real soccer&quot; in the NASL once the dust settled.

Within weeks, in late December 1978, his defection and deception became known back home, creating one of the biggest scandals in Yugoslav sporting history. Hajduk management was furious. They orchestrated a smear campaign against Žungul in Yugoslav media, branding him a traitor, a deserter, and a drunk. They also asked the Yugoslav FA (FSJ) to enlist its FIFA connections and request a ban on Žungul taking part in any FIFA-affiliated competitions. FSJ did so and FIFA granted the ban, effectively blackballing him from the NASL. This left the MISL, which was not affiliated with FIFA, as his only option.

===Indoor soccer: New York Arrows===
Settling for an indoor football career, Žungul—now known as Steve Zungul—tried to make the best of the new situation. After playing European Cup football with Hajduk as well competing at the European Championship with Yugoslavia, the 24-year-old suddenly found himself in a whole new sport resembling human pinball with ice hockey-style dasher boards around the field, buzzers, flashing lights, disco music, galloping players and the ball rebounding haphazardly off the walls and around the turf. Though financially well compensated for his services, the move to indoor in professional terms meant being relegated to playing with and against players whose skills and abilities were far inferior to his.

Making his debut in the Arrows&#x27; opening game of the season in Nassau Coliseum he immediately established his scoring credentials, recording four goals. He would soon start scoring goals like a man possessed. He finished the campaign close second to Fred Grgurev in the 1978–79 season scoring race as the Arrows won the title. In his second season, Zungul led the MISL in goals scored in 1979–80, guiding his team to the second straight league title and winning the league MVP honours.

In the 1980–81 season, Zungul achieved an amazing feat, scoring 108 goals in 40 games. In comparison, the second leading scorer Vic Davidson of the Phoenix Inferno scored only 50 goals. Zungul was well on his way to earning his eventual moniker &quot;Lord of All Indoors&quot;, first given to him by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer JD Reed. The Arrows won the title again (their third straight), while Zungul won MVP for the second consecutive season.

Zungul picked up another 103 goals the next season, 1981–82, leading the team to yet another league title while co-sharing the league MVP honour with Polish forward Stan Terlecki. All the while, Zungul pursued every legal avenue available in order to be allowed to play outdoor soccer. He took his case to the Supreme Court of the United States and finally managed to procure a licence to play on the big pitch.

For the 1982–83 season, he began the campaign with the Arrows. However, the team was in decline, and his scoring rate that took a bit of dip compared to previous seasons. Now 28-years-of-age, in January 1983 he asked for an increase of his $150,000 annual paycheck, an amount he knew that the financially strapped management couldn&#x27;t afford. The Arrows responded by trading Steve Zungul to the Golden Bay Earthquakes of the North American Soccer League (NASL), who were playing the 1982–83 MISL season as a guest team, for Gary Etherington and Gordon Hill. While billed as a move to &quot;Americanize&quot; the Arrows, it was largely a cost saving device. While Zungul still led the league in scoring, he bagged only 75 goals.

Now the FIFA ban became the issue once again, and FSJ chimed in, asking for the ban to be upheld. It wasn&#x27;t, due to the Earthquakes refusing to honour it by referencing the US Supreme Court decision, meaning the player would get his chance in the outdoor game again following a four-year absence.

===Return to outdoor: Golden Bay Earthquakes===
Zungul went on to become a first team NASL All Star in both 1983 and 1984.

In 1984, he capped his outdoor career by being named the NASL MVP. That year, Zungul registered 20 goals and 10 assists in 24 games, but could not keep the Earthquakes out of the bottom of the Western Conference.

Meanwhile, without Zungul&#x27;s scoring touch the Arrows collapsed and folded at the end of the 1983–84 season.

===Back to indoor: San Diego Sockers and Tacoma Stars===
When the NASL itself collapsed at the end of the 1984 season, Zungul moved to the San Diego Sockers (MISL). He led the league again in scoring in 1985 and 1986. On 5 February 1986, the Sockers sold Zungul to the Tacoma Stars where he played from 1986 to 1988. In 1988, he returned to the Sockers where he ended his career in 1990. It was not until 1987 that his run as top scorer finally came to a close, as another indoor luminary, the Dallas Sidekicks&#x27; Tatu, took Zungul&#x27;s place at the top of the scoring charts. Zungul was also named the league&#x27;s MVP from 1979 to 1982, and then again in 1985 and 1986. At one time, he was the all-time goal scoring leader in indoor soccer with 715 goals. That currently ranks fourth behind Hector Marinaro, Zoran Karić, and Tatu.

==International career==
Žungul made his debut for Yugoslavia in a September 1974 friendly match against Italy, coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Danilo Popivoda, and earned a total of 14 caps, scoring no goals. He played in Euro 1976 but never played in the World Cup because he did not serve the mandatory stint in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). His final international was an October 1978 European CHampionship qualification match away against Romania.

==Post-playing==
Simultaneous to playing soccer in America, Žungul invested his earnings in various business ventures including real-estate. He has at one time owned properties in Wellington, Florida.

Žungul reportedly resides in San Pasqual Valley near Escondido, California with his wife Lorenza and their two children Sashka and Marco.

In 2023, he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

<text>Castiglione Olona is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Varese, in Lombardy. As of 31 December 2015, it has a population of 7,753 inhabitants.

The area of the town with the greatest tourist attractions is the historic center.

The entrance to the historic center is through two gates in the ancient medieval walls, both on the street Via Roma: the Western Gate, for the people arriving from the medieval bridge over the Olona River, and the Eastern Gate, for those arriving from the modern part of the town.

==History==
The town of Castiglione Olona rose around the fifth century CE under the Roman Empire domain. Consequently, the Lombards entered and took possession of the village until the Castiglioni family became sole proprietor of the land around 1000 AC. The family engaged in many battles for the rule of the lands so they had walls built all around the village to protect themselves from enemies. Today only a small part of the walls near the fortress is visitable. In 1422, cardinal Branda da Castiglione obtained the permission from Pope Martin V to build the church of Collegiata (Santi Stefano e Lorenzo); the church contains frescoes attributed to Masolino.

In the town, the 15th and 16th century palace of cardinal Branda now serves as a museum, still contains a chapel and a number of frescoed walls, some attributed to Sienese painter Vecchietta.

The church of the Santissimo Corpo di Cristo, also known as the church of Villa, is located in G. Garibaldi square in the historic center. The building, constructed between 1437 and 1444 on the site of an ancient oratory of the 13th century dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre, declares a close descent from Brunelleschi&#x27;s architectural models.

==Twin towns — sister cities==
Castiglione Olona is twinned with:

* Étupes, France

== Sport ==
*The Varesina stadium complex and Stadio Comunale di Venegono is home to Varesina Sport CV SSD football team.

*The Moto Club Castiglione Olona organised motorcycle speedway and the track on Via Asiago. It hosted important events, including qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Team Cup in 1976 and 1980 and a qualifying round of the Speedway World Championship in 1978.

The site of the former track is the Varesina Sports Center, which today has two synthetic football pitches and a smaller covered indoor pitch.

She played Roxy Harvey on &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; and as Sheila &quot;Grams&quot; Bennett on &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;. She also played the role of Gemma on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Jaye (née Resendes) and William Vincent Guy, she was raised in the affluent historic Collier Heights neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia, where she attended Northside Performing Arts High School. Her mother, a Portuguese American, was a former high-school teacher, and her father, who was African-American, was pastor of the historic Friendship Baptist Church of Atlanta, which served as an early home to Spelman College; he was also a college instructor in philosophy and religion. At the age of 17, she moved to New York City to study dance at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center.

==Acting career==
===Television roles===
Guy began her television career with a non-speaking role, as a dancer, in seven episodes of the 1982 television series &quot;Fame&quot; under the direction of choreographer Debbie Allen.

Guy today remains best known for her starring role as Whitley Gilbert in the television sitcom &quot;A Different World.&quot; A spin-off of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and created by Bill Cosby himself, the show aired from 1987 to 1993 on NBC. Guy wrote three episodes of the show and directed one, in addition to appearing in every episode: she started as a co-star, but ended up replacing the show&#x27;s original star Lisa Bonet, who left the series. Guy was nominated for and won six consecutive NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

In addition to her defining role on &quot;A Different World&quot;, she appeared in a 1991 episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; as Kayla, one of Will Smith&#x27;s girlfriends. In 1992, Guy appeared in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Stompin&#x27; at the Savoy&quot; alongside Vanessa Williams, again under the direction of Debbie Allen, and in 1993, she played the mother of Halle Berry&#x27;s character in the CBS TV mini-series &quot;Queen&quot;. This was based on Alex Haley&#x27;s book &quot;,&quot; a companion volume to his earlier &quot;,&quot; which itself had been converted to a television mini-series. In 1995, Guy appeared as Peter Burns&#x27; love interest, Caitlin Mills, on two episodes of &quot;Melrose Place,&quot; and in 1996, she appeared on &quot;Living Single,&quot; playing a psychologist treating main character Khadijah for anxiety. She also played the recurring role of Kathleen, a fallen angel, in the CBS Network drama &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; from 1995 to 1997. In 2002, Guy lent her voice to the PBS math-based animated series &quot;Cyberchase&quot;, playing Ava, the queen of the cybersite Symmetria, and made a cameo appearance on the &quot;Moesha&quot; spin-off &quot;The Parkers&quot;. In 2003, Guy played Mary Estes Peters in the HBO documentary, &quot;Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narrative,&quot; a documentary which premiered during Black History Month. The slave narratives were based on the WPA slave interviews conducted during the 1930s with over 2,000 former slaves.

Guy starred alongside Ellen Muth and Mandy Patinkin in the series &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, created by Bryan Fuller. The show ran 29 episodes over two seasons, in 2003 and 2004, on Showtime. Guy played Roxy Harvey, a meter maid turned police officer and one of the core group of grim reapers around which the series was based. Guy was nominated for the 2005 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the role. She later starred in the feature-length series sequel &quot;Dead Like Me: Life After Death,&quot; which was released on video in 2009 before being shown on the Syfy channel. In 2009, Guy performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary that used dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;. A broad look at civil rights issues in America, &quot;The People Speak&quot; was executive produced by and seen on The History Channel. In 2010, she was seen in the second season of the Lifetime comedy series &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot; as a judge in the episode titled &quot;Last Year&#x27;s Model,&quot; and from 2009 to 2017, Guy had a recurring role in The CW&#x27;s series &quot;The Vampire Diaries.&quot; In that program, Guy played Sheila &quot;Grams&quot; Bennett, the grandmother of Bonnie (Katerina Graham), who proved to be a descendant of Salem Witches. Both shows were filmed in the Atlanta area. In late 2017, she appeared in the Lifetime Christmas movie &quot;Secret Santa&quot;. Recently, she appeared on the Amazon Prime series “Harlem” as the mother of one of the protagonists.

===Film roles===
Guy made her film debut in 1988 in Spike Lee&#x27;s musical-drama film &quot;School Daze&quot;. She played the role of Dina, a member of the light-skinned, straight-haired African American women of Gamma Ray, a women&#x27;s auxiliary to the Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity. Filming on &quot;School Daze&quot; was completed before she joined the cast of &quot;A Different World&quot;. During the following year, she appeared as Dominique La Rue in &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; starring Eddie Murphy (who also directed), Richard Pryor, and Redd Foxx. In 1997, she provided the speaking voice of Sawyer in the Warner Bros. animated film &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;. In 2011, she appeared in the film &quot;October Baby&quot;. In 2015, she appeared in the film &quot;Big Stone Gap&quot; with Ashley Judd, Patrick Wilson, Jenna Elfman, Anthony LaPaglia, Jane Krakowski, and Whoopi Goldberg. She starred in the short film &quot;My Nephew Emmett&quot;, which won the Student Academy Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 2018.

===Stage===
In 1987, Guy had a starring role in the off-Broadway hit musical &quot;Beehive&quot;, before traveling to France to appear in a similar musical review. Guy has performed in several Broadway productions and national tours, including as Crow in &quot;The Wiz&quot;, Mickey in &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot;, Betty Rizzo in &quot;Grease&quot;, and as Velma Kelly in &quot;Chicago&quot;. On April 6, 2009, &quot;Playbill&quot; reported on Guy&#x27;s return to the stage, starring in the True Colors Theatre Company production of Pearl Cleage&#x27;s &quot;Blues for an Alabama Sky.&quot; Directed by Andrea Frye, the show was a last minute addition to the company&#x27;s season and opened May 4 in Atlanta. &quot;Blues&quot; came on the heels of Guy&#x27;s held-over run in True Colors&#x27; &quot;Miss Evers&#x27; Boys,&quot; which co-starred TC Carson of &quot;Living Single&quot;.

Guy directed the world premiere of &quot;I Dream&quot; in July 2010 on the Alliance Stage of the Woodruff Arts Centre in Atlanta. Also in 2010, Guy was a member of the cast of the Alabama Shakespeare Festival and the Alliance Theatre Company co-production of Pearl Cleage&#x27;s &quot;The Nacirema Society Requests the Honor of Your Presence at a Celebration of Their First One-Hundred Years.&quot; The production ran September 24 through October 3 at the Festival in Montgomery, Alabama, before moving to Atlanta&#x27;s Alliance Theatre for performances October 20 through November 14. In early 2011, Guy directed George C. Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Colored Museum&quot; for True Colors, and in June 2011, Guy costarred with Kenny Leon in their production of Sam Shepard&#x27;s play &quot;Fool For Love&quot; at The Balzer Theater at Herren&#x27;s in Atlanta, Georgia. In August 2010, Guy had joined Kenny Leon&#x27;s True Colors Theatre Company in an off stage role as the company&#x27;s Producing Director. In announcing the hire, &quot;True Colors&quot; said Guy&#x27;s full-time position would be both administrative and artistic, and both local and national. Guy continues to contribute to the company on stage as well.

==Music career==
During the run of &quot;A Different World,&quot; Guy released her self-titled debut album in 1990. The album peaked at No. 143 on the US Top 200 Album Chart and spawned three hit singles: &quot;Try Me&quot; (US R&amp;B No. 14); &quot;Another Like My Lover&quot; (US No. 66, US R&amp;B No. 9); and &quot;Just Want to Hold You&quot; (US No. 34, US R&amp;B No. 27), with the last single cracking the main US Top 40 singles chart.

==Personal life==
Guy had a close friendship with rapper Tupac Shakur. They met during his guest appearance on the sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot; in 1993. Shakur recuperated at Guy&#x27;s home after he was shot in 1994. Guy appeared in his music video &quot;Temptations&quot; and later wrote his mother&#x27;s biography, &quot;Afeni Shakur: Evolution of a Revolutionary&quot;.

<doc id="1087333" wikidata="Q692336" url="?curid=1087333" title="Racial Integrity Act of 1924">
<text>In 1924, the Virginia General Assembly enacted the Racial Integrity Act. The act reinforced racial segregation by prohibiting interracial marriage and classifying as &quot;white&quot; a person &quot;who has no trace whatsoever of any blood other than Caucasian&quot;. The act, an outgrowth of eugenicist and scientific racist propaganda, was pushed by Walter Plecker, a white supremacist and eugenicist who held the post of registrar of the Virginia Bureau of Vital Statistics.

The Racial Integrity Act required that all birth certificates and marriage certificates in Virginia to include the person&#x27;s race as either &quot;white&quot; or &quot;colored&quot;. The Act classified all non-whites, including Native Americans, as &quot;colored&quot;. The act was part of a series of &quot;racial integrity laws&quot; enacted in Virginia to reinforce racial hierarchies and prohibit the mixing of races; other statutes included the Public Assemblages Act of 1926 (which required the racial segregation of all public meeting areas) and a 1930 act that defined any person with even a trace of sub-Saharan African ancestry as black (thus codifying the so-called &quot;one-drop rule&quot;).

In 1967, the Act was officially overturned by the United States Supreme Court in their ruling &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;. In 2001, the Virginia General Assembly passed a resolution that condemned the Act for its &quot;use as a respectable, &#x27;scientific&#x27; veneer to cover the activities of those who held blatantly racist views&quot;.

==History leading to the laws&#x27; passage: 1859–1924==
In the 1920s, Virginia&#x27;s registrar of statistics, Walter Ashby Plecker, was allied with the newly founded Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America in persuading the Virginia General Assembly to pass the Racial Integrity Law of 1924. The club was founded in Virginia by John Powell of Richmond in the fall of 1922; within a year the club for white males had more than 400 members and 31 posts in the state.

In 1923, the Anglo-Saxon Club founded two posts in Charlottesville, one for the town and one for students at the University of Virginia. A major goal was to end &quot;amalgamation&quot; by interracial marriage. Members also claimed to support Anglo-Saxon ideas of fair play. Later that fall, a state convention of club members was to be held in Richmond.

The Virginia assembly&#x27;s 21st-century explanation for the laws summarizes their development:
The now-discredited pseudoscience of eugenics was based on theories first propounded in England by Francis Galton, the cousin and of famed biologist Charles Darwin. The goal of the &quot;science&quot; of eugenics was to improve the human race by eliminating what the movement&#x27;s supporters considered hereditary disorders or flaws through selective breeding and social engineering. The eugenics movement proved popular in the United States, with Indiana enacting the nation&#x27;s first eugenics-based sterilization law in 1907.

In the following five decades, other states followed Indiana&#x27;s example by implementing the eugenic laws. Wisconsin was the first state to enact legislation that required the medical certification of persons who applied for marriage licenses. The law that was enacted in 1913 generated attempts at similar legislation in other states.

Anti-miscegenation laws, banning interracial marriage between whites and non-whites, had existed long before the emergence of eugenics. First enacted during the colonial era when slavery had become essentially a racial caste, such laws were in effect in Virginia and in much of the United States until the 1960s.

The first law banning all marriage between whites and blacks was enacted in the colony of Virginia in 1691. This example was followed by Maryland (in 1692) and several of the other Thirteen Colonies. By 1913, 30 out of the then 48 states (including all Southern states) enforced such laws.

===The Pocahontas exception===
The Racial Integrity Act was subject to the Pocahontas Clause (or Pocahontas Exception), which allowed people with claims of less than 1/16 American Indian ancestry to still be considered white, despite the otherwise unyielding climate of one-drop rule politics. The exception regarding the American Indian blood quantum was included as an amendment to the original Act in response to concerns of Virginia elites, including many of the First Families of Virginia, who had always claimed descent from Pocahontas with pride, but now worried that the new legislation would jeopardize their status. The exception stated:

It shall thereafter be unlawful for any white person in this State to marry any save a white person, or a person with no other admixture of blood than white and American Indian. For the purpose of this act, the term &quot;white person&quot; shall apply only to the person who has no trace whatsoever of any blood other than Caucasian; but persons who have one-sixteenth or less of the blood of the American Indian and have no other non-Caucasic blood shall be deemed to be white persons.

While definitions of &quot;Indian&quot;, &quot;colored&quot;, and variations of these were established and altered throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, this was the first direct case of whiteness itself being defined officially.

===Enforcement===
Once these laws were passed, Plecker was in the position to enforce them. Governor E. Lee Trinkle, a year after signing the act, asked Plecker to ease up on the Indians and not &quot;embarrass them any more than possible.&quot; Plecker responded, &quot;I am unable to see how it is working any injustice upon them or humiliation for our office to take a firm stand against their intermarriage with white people, or to the preliminary steps of recognition as Indians with permission to attend white schools and to ride in white coaches.&quot;

Unsatisfied with the &quot;Pocahontas Exception&quot;, eugenicists introduced an amendment to narrow loopholes to the Racial Integrity Act. This was considered by the Virginia General Assembly in February 1926, but it failed to pass. If adopted, the amendment would have reclassified thousands of &quot;white&quot; people as &quot;colored&quot; by more strictly implementing the &quot;one-drop rule&quot; of ancestry as applied to American Indian ancestry.

Plecker reacted strongly to the Pocahontas Clause with fierce concerns of the white race being &quot;swallowed up by the quagmire of mongrelization&quot;, particularly after marriage cases like that of the Johns and Sorrels, in which the women of these couples argued that the family members listed as &quot;colored&quot; had actually been Native American because of historically unclear categorizing.

==Implementation and consequences: 1924–1979==
The combined effect of these two laws adversely affected the continuity of Virginia&#x27;s American Indian tribes. The Racial Integrity Act called for only two racial categories to be recorded on birth certificates, rather than the traditional six: &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; (which now included Indian and all discernible mixed-race persons). The effects were quickly seen. In 1930, the US census for Virginia recorded 779 Indians; by 1940, that number had been reduced to 198. In effect, Indians were being erased as a group from official records.

In addition, as Plecker admitted, he enforced the Racial Integrity Act extending far beyond his jurisdiction in the segregated society. For instance, he pressured school superintendents to exclude mixed-race (then called mulatto) children from white schools. Plecker ordered the exhumation of dead people of &quot;questionable ancestry&quot; from white cemeteries to be reinterred elsewhere.

===Indians reclassified as colored===
As registrar, Plecker directed the reclassification of nearly all Virginia Indians as &quot;colored&quot; on their birth and marriage certificates.
Consequently, two or three generations of Virginia Indians had their ethnic identity altered on these public documents. Fiske reported that Plecker&#x27;s tampering with the vital records of the Virginia Indian tribes made it impossible for descendants of six of the eight tribes recognized by the state to gain federal recognition, because they could no longer prove their American Indian ancestry by documented historical continuity.

===Involuntary sterilization===
Historians have not estimated the impact of the miscegenation laws. There are records, however, of the number of people who were involuntarily sterilized during the years these two laws were in effect. Of the involuntary sterilizations reported in the United States prior to 1957, Virginia was second, having sterilized a total of 6,683 persons (California was first, having sterilized 19,985 people without their consent). Many more women than men were sterilized: 4,043 to 2,640. Of those, 2,095 women were sterilized under the category of &quot;Mentally Ill&quot;; and 1,875 under the category &quot;Mentally Deficient&quot;. The remainder were for &quot;Other&quot; reasons. Other states reported involuntary sterilizations of similar numbers of people as Virginia.

===Leaders target persons of color===
The intention to control or reduce ethnic minorities, especially Negroes, can be seen in writings by some leaders in the eugenics movement:

In an 1893 &quot;open letter&quot; published in the &quot;Virginia Medical Monthly&quot;, Hunter Holmes McGuire, a Richmond physician and president of the American Medical Association, asked for &quot;some scientific explanation of the sexual perversion in the Negro of the present day.&quot; McGuire&#x27;s correspondent, Chicago physician G. Frank Lydston, replied that African-American men raped white women because of &quot;[h]ereditary influences descending from the uncivilized ancestors of our Negroes.&quot; Lydston suggested as a solution to perform surgical castration, which &quot;prevents the criminal from perpetuating his kind.

In 1935, a decade after the passage of Virginia&#x27;s eugenics laws, Plecker wrote to Walter Gross, director of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Bureau of Human Betterment and Eugenics. Plecker described Virginia&#x27;s racial purity laws and requested to be put on Gross&#x27; mailing list. Plecker commented upon the Third Reich&#x27;s sterilization of 600 children in the Rhineland (the so-called Rhineland Bastards, who were born of German women by black French colonial fathers): &quot;I hope this work is complete and not one has been missed. I sometimes regret that we have not the authority to put some measures in practice in Virginia.&quot;

Despite lacking the statutory authority to sterilize black, mulatto, and American Indian children simply because they were &quot;colored&quot;, a small number of Virginia eugenicists in key positions found other ways to achieve that goal. The Sterilization Act gave State institutions, including hospitals, psychiatric institutions and prisons, the statutory authority to sterilize persons deemed to be &quot;feebleminded&quot; — a highly subjective criterion.

Joseph DeJarnette, director of the Western State Hospital in Staunton, Virginia, was a leading advocate of eugenics. DeJarnette was unsatisfied with the pace of America&#x27;s eugenics sterilization programs. In 1938, he wrote:

Germany in six years has sterilized about 80,000 of her unfit while the United States — with approximately twice the population — has only sterilized about 27,869 in the past 20 years. ... The fact that there are 12,000,000 defectives in the US should arouse our best endeavors to push this procedure to the maximum ... The Germans are beating us at our own game.

By &quot;12 million defectives&quot; (a tenth of the population), DeJarnette was almost certainly referring to ethnic minorities, as there have never been 12 million mental patients in the United States.

According to historian Gregory M. Dorr, the University of Virginia School of Medicine (UVA) became &quot;an epicenter of eugenical thought&quot; that was &quot;closely linked with the national movement.&quot; One of UVA&#x27;s leading eugenicists, Harvey Ernest Jordan, PhD was promoted to dean of medicine in 1939 and served until 1949. He was in a position to shape the opinion and practice of Virginia physicians for several decades. This excerpt from a 1934 UVA student paper indicates one student&#x27;s thoughts: &quot;In Germany, Hitler has decreed that about 400,000 persons be sterilized. This is a great step in eliminating the racial deficients.&quot;

The racial effects of the program in Virginia can be seen by the disproportionately high number of black and American Indian women who were given forced sterilizations after coming to a hospital for other reasons, such as childbirth. Doctors sometimes sterilized the women without their knowledge or consent in the course of other surgery.

===Responses to the Racial Integrity Act===
In the early 20th century, persons of color in everyday southern society feared to voice their opinions due to severe oppression. Magazines such as the &quot;Richmond Planet&quot; offered the black community a voice and the opportunity to have their concerns heard. &quot;The Richmond Planet&quot; made a difference in society by openly expressing the opinions of persons of color in society. After the passing of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 the &quot;Richmond Planet&quot; published the article &quot;Race Amalgamation Bill Being Passed in Va. Legislature. Much Discussion Here on race Integrity and Mongrelization ... Bill Would Prohibit Marriage of Whites and Non-whites ...&quot;Skull of Bones&quot; Discusses race question.&quot; The journalist opened the article with Racial Integrity Act and gave a brief synopsis of the act. Then followed statements from the creators of the Racial Integrity Act, John Powell and Earnest S. Cox. Mr. Powell believed that the Racial Integrity Act was needed as &quot;maintenance of the integrity of the white race to preserve its superior blood&quot; and Cox believed in what he called &quot;the great man concept&quot; which means that if the races were to intersect that it would lower the rate of great white men in the world. He defended his position by saying that non-whites would agree with his ideology:

The sane and educated Negro does not want social equality ... They do not want intermarriage or social mingling any more than does the average American white man wants it. They have race pride as well as we. They want racial purity as much as we want it. There are both sides to the question and to form an unbiased opinion either way requires a thorough study of the matter on both sides.

===Carrie Buck and the Supreme Court===
Racial minorities were not the only people affected by these laws. About 4,000 poor white Virginians were involuntarily sterilized by government order. When Laughlin testified before the Virginia assembly in support of the Sterilization Act in 1924, he argued that the &quot;shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South&quot;, created social problems for &quot;normal&quot; people. He said, &quot;The multiplication of these &#x27;defective delinquents&#x27; could only be controlled by restricting their procreation&quot;.

Carrie Buck was the most widely known white victim of Virginia&#x27;s eugenics laws. She was born in Charlottesville to Emma Buck. After her birth, Carrie was placed with foster parents, John and Alice Dobbs. She attended public school until the sixth grade. After that, she continued to live with the Dobbses, and did domestic work in the home.

Carrie became pregnant when she was 17, as a result of being raped by the nephew of her foster parents. To hide the act, on January 23, 1924, Carrie&#x27;s foster parents committed the girl to the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded on the grounds of feeblemindedness, incorrigible behavior, and promiscuity. They did not tell the court the true cause of her pregnancy. On March 28, 1924, Buck gave birth to a daughter, whom she named Vivian. Since Carrie had been declared mentally incompetent to raise her child, her former foster parents adopted the baby.

On September 10, 1924, Albert Sidney Priddy, superintendent of the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded and a eugenicist, filed a petition with his board of directors to sterilize Carrie Buck, an 18-year-old patient. He claimed she had a mental age of 9. Priddy said that Buck represented a genetic threat to society. While the litigation was making its way through the court system, Priddy died and his successor, James Hendren Bell, came on the case.

When the directors issued an order for the sterilization of Buck, her guardian appealed the case to the Circuit Court of Amherst County. It sustained the decision of the board. The case then moved to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, where it was upheld. It was appealed to the US Supreme Court in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, which upheld the order.

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote the ruling. He argued the interest of &quot;public welfare&quot; outweighed the interest of individuals in bodily integrity:

We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.

Holmes concluded his argument with the phrase: &quot;Three generations of imbeciles are enough&quot;.

Carrie Buck was paroled from the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded shortly after she was sterilized. Under the same statute, her mother and three-year-old daughter were also sterilized without their consent. In 1932, her daughter Vivian Buck died of &quot;enteric colitis&quot;.

When hospitalized for appendicitis, Doris Buck, Carrie&#x27;s younger sister, was sterilized without her knowledge or consent. Never told that the operation had been performed, Doris Buck married and with her husband tried to have children. It was not until 1980 that she was told the reason for her inability to get pregnant.

Carrie Buck went on to marry William Eagle. They were married for 25 years until his death. Scholars and reporters who visited Buck in the aftermath of the Supreme Court case reported that she appeared to be a woman of normal intelligence.

The effect of the US Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; was to legitimize eugenic sterilization laws in the country. While many states already had sterilization laws on their books, most except for California had used them erratically and infrequently. After &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, dozens of states added new sterilization statutes, or updated their laws. They passed statutes that more closely followed the Virginia statute upheld by the Court.

==Supreme Court, repeals and apology: 1967–2002==
On June 12, 1967, the US Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; that the portion of the Racial Integrity Act that criminalized marriages between &quot;whites&quot; and &quot;nonwhites&quot; was found to be contrary to the guarantees of equal protection of citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In 1975, the Virginia General Assembly repealed the remainder of the Racial Integrity Act. In 1979, it repealed the Sterilization Act. In 2001, the General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill (HJ607ER) to express the assembly&#x27;s profound regret for its role in the eugenics movement. On May 2, 2002, Governor Mark R. Warner issued a statement also expressing &quot;profound regret for the commonwealth&#x27;s role in the eugenics movement,&quot; specifically naming Virginia&#x27;s 1924 compulsory sterilization legislation.

<text>The spectroheliograph is an instrument used in astronomy which captures a photographic image of the Sun at a single wavelength of light, a monochromatic image. The wavelength is usually chosen to coincide with a spectral wavelength of one of the chemical elements present in the Sun.

It was developed independently by George Ellery Hale and Henri-Alexandre Deslandres in the 1890s and further refined in 1932 by Robert R. McMath to take motion pictures.

The instrument comprises a prism or diffraction grating and a narrow slit that passes a single wavelength (a monochromator). The light is focused onto a photographic medium and the slit is moved across the disk of the Sun to form a complete image.

It is now possible to make a filter that transmits a narrow band of wavelengths which produces a similar image, but spectroheliographs remain in use.

<text>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury is a junior ministerial post in His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury, ranked below the First Lord of the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Paymaster General and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and alongside the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury. It ranks at Parliamentary Secretary level and the holder does not attend Cabinet. Since 2014, the holder has also generally held the position of City Minister. It is shadowed by the Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury. 

==History==
The office was created in November 1947. In 1961, the Economic Secretary became junior to the new office of Chief Secretary to the Treasury, which held a seat in cabinet.

Following the establishment of the Department of Economic Affairs in 1964, the Economic Secretary, Anthony Crosland, transferred to become Minister of State in that department. The post of Economic Secretary to the Treasury was abolished on 22 December 1964. Although the Department of Economic Affairs closed in 1969, the Treasury post was not re-established until 11 November 1981.

From April 2014 to September 2022, and since October 2022, the office of Economic Secretary to the Treasury has been held concurrently with the portfolio of &#x27;City Minister&#x27;.

==Responsibilities==
The Economic Secretary is responsible, though more senior ministers share in decision-making, for the answering of written and verbal parliamentary questions and for the devising of regulations, orders and legislation in various matters. Until September 2022, these matters included banking and finance, including banks, insurance, personal savings, financial regulation, and foreign exchange reserves. He or she was also involved in taxation as it impacted on these areas, such as tax on savings and pensions, and Insurance Premium Tax. In addition, the Economic Secretary, until September 2002, advised on economic policy and continues to work with other Treasury ministers on the Comprehensive Spending Review and finance bills.

<doc id="1087368" wikidata="Q2269429" url="?curid=1087368" title="York railway station">
<text>York railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) serving the cathedral city of York, North Yorkshire, England. It is north of and, on the main line, it is situated between to the south and to the north. , the station is operated by London North Eastern Railway (LNER). It is the busiest station in North Yorkshire, the third busiest in Yorkshire &amp; the Humber and the sixth busiest in Northern England, as well as being the busiest intermediate station on the East Coast Main Line. In &quot;Britain&#x27;s 100 Best Railway Stations&quot; by Simon Jenkins, the station was one of only ten to be awarded five stars.

The present York station was built during the 1870s after it had become clear that the old station, which could not facilitate through traffic due to its positioning, was a hindrance to long distance express services along what is now referred to as the ECML. Designed by the North Eastern Railway architects Thomas Prosser and William Peachey and built by Lucas Brothers, the station was built to be expansive and well-furnished from the onset, complete with a distinctive curved train shed. Upon its opening on 25 June 1877, it was the largest railway station in the world, possessing 13 platforms along with various amenities, including a dedicated hotel (now The Principal York). Various additional facilities, from lengthened platforms to additional passenger facilities such as tea sheds, would be built subsequently.

The station took extensive damage from German bombers during the Second World War, resulting in both deaths and injuries amongst the staff. Repairs to the station were completed in 1947. Journey times between York and other destinations along the ECML were slashed following the introduction of British Rail Class 55 &quot;Deltic&quot; locomotives and InterCity 125 high speed trains. During the late 1980s, extensive changes were made to the signalling and track layout through and around the station as a part of the wider electrification of the ECML. These works facilitated the use of electric traction, such as the InterCity 225, at York station for the first time. Further improvements to the station have continued following the privatisation of British Rail, including new control facilities, additional retail units, redesigned approaches and track layout changes.

York station is a key junction approximately halfway between London and Edinburgh. It is approximately north of the point where the Cross Country and TransPennine Express routes via Leeds join the main line, connecting Scotland and the North East, North West, Midlands and southern England. The junction was historically a major site for rolling stock manufacture, maintenance and repair.

==History==
===Background and construction===
The first York railway station was a temporary wooden building on Queen Street outside the walls of the city, opened in 1839 by the York and North Midland Railway (Y&amp;NMR). It was succeeded in 1841, inside the walls, by what is now York old railway station. On 31 July 1854, the Y&amp;NMR merged with the Leeds Northern Railway and the York, Newcastle &amp; Berwick Railway to form the North Eastern Railway (NER); shortly thereafter, it became clear that the company&#x27;s desire to run through trains between London and Newcastle without needing to reverse out of the old York station to continue their journey would necessitate change, specifically the construction of a new through station outside the city walls. Furthermore, as the NER&#x27;s dominance of rail traffic in the region expanded through further mergers, several directors desired an expansive and elaborate facility to serve York, where the company was headquartered. During 1866, Parliament authorised the construction of this new railway station.

This new station was designed by the North Eastern Railway architects Thomas Prosser and William Peachey and built by Lucas Brothers. A prominent feature was the large curved train shed, which had been viewed as one of the more impressive monuments of the railway age. This train shed was supported by a combination of wrought-iron trusses and cast-iron columns. The majority of the station was built of yellow Scarborough brick with moulded ashlar plinths and dressings. The site selected for the station had been formerly used as agricultural land, although a Roman-era cemetery was located there as well.

Construction of the present station took place between 1871 and 1877. Opened on 25 June 1877, it had 13 platforms and, at that time, was the largest railway station in the world. As part of the new station project, the Royal Station Hotel (now The Principal York), designed by Peachey, opened in 1878. The original ticket hall and concourse were both located on the eastern side of the station.

===Alterations===

Between 1900 and 1909, several of the original platforms were extended both northwards and southwards while an additional western platform was added; a new signal box, tea room and book shop were also opened. Between 1938 and 1939, the western platform was refurbished, the current footbridge was built, and the station was resignalled.

The station was heavily bombed during the Second World War. On one occasion, on 29 April 1942, 800 passengers had to be evacuated from a King&#x27;s Cross-Edinburgh train which arrived during a bombing raid. On the same night, two railway workers were killed, one being station foreman William Milner, who died after returning to his burning office to collect his first aid kit; he was posthumously awarded the King&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct. A plaque in his memory has been erected at the station. The station was extensively repaired in 1947.

During 1951, a new signal box was opened. The station was designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1968. An extensive refurbishment was undertaken in 1977. Journey times between York and other destinations along the ECML were slashed following the introduction of the British Rail Class 55 locomotive in 1961 and the Intercity 125 high speed train during 1976.

The track layout through and around the station was remodelled again in 1988 as part of the resignalling scheme that was carried out prior to the electrification of the ECML shortly afterwards by British Rail. This resulted in several bay platforms (mainly on the eastern side) being taken out of service and the track to them removed. Consequently, the number of platforms was reduced from 15 to 11. In May 1989, a new signalling centre (York IECC) was commissioned on the western side of the station to control the new layout and also take over the function of several other signal boxes on the main line. The IECC supervised the main line from Temple Hirst (near Doncaster) through to , along with sections of the various routes branching from it. It had also taken over responsibility for the control area of the former power box at and thus, the signalling for trains as far away as and .

Between 2006 and 2007, the approaches to the station were reorganised to improve facilities for bus, taxi and car users as well as pedestrians and cyclists. The former motive power depot and goods station now house the National Railway Museum. The station was renovated during 2009; these works included the reconstruction of Platform 9 and the implementation of extensive lighting alterations. New automated ticket gates (similar to those in Leeds) were planned, but the City of York Council wished to avoid spoiling the historic nature of the station. The then operator National Express East Coast planned to appeal this decision, but the plans were scrapped altogether upon the franchise&#x27;s handover to East Coast. During the late 2000s and early 2010s, the track and signalling systems on the southern side of the station were renewed. In early 2011, an additional line and a new junction were completed, which eliminated one of the biggest bottlenecks on the ECML.

Further improvements to the station have been made under LNER&#x27;s stewardship, including a new lounge for first class passengers, additional retail units, and new public toilets.

===Accidents and incidents===
* On 31 March 1920, a passenger train was derailed as it entered platform 8.
* On 5 August 1958, a passenger train crashed into the buffers at platform 12.
* On 18 January 2006, a freight train wagon derailed on points entering platform 3 before re-railing 400 sleepers later causing extensive damage to trackworks through the station. The derailment happened due to faulty suspension on one of the bogies causing the load to sit unevenly across the axles, lifting the axle off the tracks as it went round the corner over the points.

==Layout==
All the platforms except 9, 10 and 11 are under the large, curved, glass and iron roof. They are accessed via a long footbridge, which also connects to the National Railway Museum, or via lifts and either of two pedestrian tunnels. Between April 1984 and 2011, the old tea rooms housed the Rail Riders World/York Model Railway exhibition.

=== Platforms ===
The platforms at York have been renumbered several times, the most recent being in the late 1980s to coincide with a reduction in the number of platforms from 15 to 11. The current use is:
* Platform 1: South-facing bay platform mostly used for services to Hull and Bridlington or via and for stabling empty stock.
* Platform 2: North-facing bay platform connected only to the Scarborough branch, used mostly for stabling a spare TransPennine Express unit along with the accompanying station siding.
* Platform 3: Main southbound platform, but is signalled bi-directionally, accessible directly from the station concourse. Fast and semi-fast southbound London North Eastern Railway for generally use this platform. CrossCountry services, Grand Central and some westbound TransPennine Express services also use it. Southbound Lumo services go through platform 3 without stopping in York, northbound Lumo services use the avoidant track west of the station.
* Platform 4: Northward continuation of platform 3 connected only to the Scarborough branch, used by TransPennine Express services from Scarborough.
* Platform 5 (split into 5a and 5b): It is the main northbound platform, but is signalled bi-directionally. Fast northbound London North Eastern Railway services to Scotland use this and generally call at Darlington and Newcastle only. It is also used by some CrossCountry services northbound and north-eastbound TransPennine Express to Scarborough generally use this platform. Southbound London North Eastern Railway services also stop here both fast and semi-fast, the latter of which generally call at Doncaster, Newark, Peterborough and London King&#x27;s Cross.
* Platform 6: South-facing bay platform used mostly by Northern Trains commuter services to and ; and by terminating London North Eastern Railway services that return south to London King&#x27;s Cross.
* Platform 7: South-facing bay platform used mostly by Northern commuter services and London North Eastern Railway services to/from London Kings Cross.
* Platform 8: North-facing bay platform used almost exclusively by Northern Trains on the Harrogate Line.
* Platforms 9, 10, 11: Bi-directional platforms used by semi-fast and some fast London North Eastern Railway services heading north to Newcastle and Scotland, CrossCountry services north and southbound via Leeds, TransPennine Express services westbound to Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Airport; and northbound to Newcastle and Redcar. Some Northern Trains services to Blackpool North and Leeds also use this platform.
Platforms 10 and 11 are outside of the main body of the station. Another siding, the former &quot;fruit dock&quot;, exists opposite platform 11.

==Recent developments==

Just to the west of the station is one of Network Rail&#x27;s modern Rail Operation Centres (ROC), which was opened in September 2014. This ROC took over the functions of the former IECC in December 2018 and will eventually control the majority of the ECML from London to the Scottish border and various subsidiary routes across the North East, Lincolnshire and South, North and West Yorkshire.

During Christmas 2020, major track replacement occurred, with Network Rail releasing time lapse footage of the works.

In 2022, work began to redevelop the area outside the station. Queen Street Bridge, built to cross the lines into the old York station within the city walls, will be demolished in April 2024.

In 2023, a further £10.5 million has been confirmed for the massive revamp of the area at the front of York railway station.

==York Central==
Located adjacent to the station, &quot;York Central&quot; is one of the largest city centre brownfield regeneration sites in the UK. The site has been designated as a UK Government ‘Housing Zone’ and has also been awarded ‘Enterprise Zone’ status, which offers commercial occupiers significant incentives. Outline planning approval was given for the site in March 2019. It is anticipated that development of the full site could take between 15 and 20 years to complete.

<doc id="1087386" wikidata="Q5449647" url="?curid=1087386" title="Financial Secretary to the Treasury">
<text>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury is a mid-level ministerial post in HM Treasury. It is nominally the fifth most significant ministerial role within the Treasury after the first lord of the Treasury, the chancellor of the Exchequer, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and the paymaster general. However, the role of First Lord of the Treasury is always held by the prime minister who is not a Treasury minister, and the position of Paymaster General is a sinecure often held by the Minister for the Cabinet Office to allow the holder of that office to draw a government salary. In practice it is, therefore, the third most senior Treasury minister and has attended Cabinet in the past.

The current holder of the position is Lord Livermore, who was appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer following the Labour Party’s victory in the 2024 General Election. The position is shadowed by the shadow financial secretary to the treasury.

==History==

The role of Financial Secretary to the Treasury was created in 1711 and was known as the Junior Secretary to the Treasury to help deal with the increasing workload of the Senior Secretary to the Treasury. The first Junior Secretary to the Treasury is recorded as Thomas Harley who was appointed on 11 June 1711. The position has continued without any major interruption to the present day. Initially when the position of Senior Secretary to the Treasury became vacant not as the result of an election of change of government the Junior Secretary was usually automatically promoted to the senior role. Over time however, the roles of the Senior and Junior Secretaries began to diverge with the Senior Secretary post being used as a sinecure post for the Chief Whip, with no formal responsibilities to the Treasury. The Junior Secretary however remained a substantive position working in the Treasury. As such the Senior Secretary became known as the &#x27;Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury&#x27; while the Junior Secretary became known as the &#x27;Financial Secretary to the Treasury&#x27; and the &#x27;automatic&#x27; promotion from Junior to Senior ceased. While the exact date this change occurred is disputed it is agreed that by 1830 the distinction was complete.

In 1923 Sir William Joynson-Hicks became the–to date–only Financial Secretary to serve in the Cabinet due to the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, also concurrently serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

In May 2010 as part of the ministerial reorganisation by the First Cameron ministry, the Financial Secretary was given the additional semi-official title of City Minister. This position was retained until April 2014 when following the promotion of Sajid Javid to Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport the portfolio of City Minister was moved from the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to the Economic Secretary to the Treasury.

Appointment to the position of Financial Secretary to the Treasury is often considered an important stepping stone in a politician&#x27;s career; six of the ten most recent holders of the office have gone on to hold Cabinet-level positions.

Notable former Financial Secretaries to the Treasury include Lord Frederick Cavendish, Austen Chamberlain, Stanley Baldwin, Enoch Powell, Nigel Lawson, and Norman Lamont.

==Current role==
The current responsibilities of the Financial Secretary to the Treasury include Departmental responsibility for the Office for National Statistics, and the Royal Mint. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury had Departmental responsibility for HM Customs &amp; Excise until the merger with the Inland Revenue to form HM Revenue &amp; Customs.

<text>In semiotics the neutral level of a sign is the &quot;trace&quot; left behind; the physical or material creation or remains of esthesic and poietic processes, levels, and analyses of symbolic forms. A part of all signs according to a tri-partitional definition, it corresponds to Saussure&#x27;s &quot;sound-image&quot; (or &quot;signified&quot;, thus Pierce&#x27;s &quot;representamen&quot;).

Thus, &quot;a symbolic form...is not some &#x27;intermediary&#x27; in a process of &#x27;communication&#x27; that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex &quot;process&quot; of creation (the poetic process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the esthesic process that &quot;reconstructs&quot; a &#x27;message.&#x27;)&quot;

Molino and Nattiez&#x27;s diagram:
An immanent description is an analysis of the neutral level.(Nattiez 1990, p. 75).

== Applied Semiotics ==

In an applied semiology the neutral level of a sign is the &quot;trace&quot; left behind by a spiritual or ideal creation (i.e. art, masterpiece etc.); or fruits of creative processes and multi-staged levels of realisations, including analysis of the qualities of the symbolic forms as a consequence of an arousement of the analyst&#x27;s or artist&#x27;s mindfullness as one of several factors for reaching an understandment of the neutral level of applied semiology depending on the frames of reference (i.e. corporeal/physical, emotional/distribution of resources - economy, intellectual/cerebral, artistic/spiritual.&quot;

== The Neutral level of the Neutral level ==

&quot;Neutral&quot; comes from the English word refers to a mutually understood non-dual background. &quot;Neuter&quot; has been used since the 14th century and is composed of &quot;ne&quot; meaning &quot;not&quot; + &quot;uter&quot; meaning &quot;which of two&quot;, thus synonymous with either [1] The Neutral state is often misinterpreted as a passive state, but it should be understood as much not-passive as not-active or equal. It literally refers to the non-dual state of body and mind, you and me or of any .

<doc id="1087396" wikidata="Q5559542" url="?curid=1087396" title="Gideon's Trumpet">
<text>Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet is a 1964 book by Anthony Lewis describing the story behind the 1963 landmark court case &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that criminal defendants have the right to an attorney even if they cannot afford one. In 1965, the book won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Fact Crime book.

A made-for-TV movie, &quot;Gideons&#x27;s Trumpet&quot;, based on the book was released in 1980, starring Henry Fonda as Clarence Earl Gideon, José Ferrer as Abe Fortas and John Houseman as Earl Warren (though Warren&#x27;s name was never mentioned in the film; he was billed simply as &quot;The Chief Justice&quot;). Houseman also provided the offscreen closing narration at the end of the film. Lewis himself appeared in a small role as &quot;The Reporter&quot;. The movie was a &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; presentation produced by Worldvision, and aired on CBS. 

The name is a play on words, using the defendant&#x27;s last name and invoking the biblical story in which Gideon ordered his small force to attack a much larger enemy camp. Gideon&#x27;s army carried trumpets and concealed torches in clay pots. When the call to attack came, the noise and light they made tricked their enemies into thinking that a much larger army was attacking them. Thus, Gideon won the battle with little actual fighting (Judges 7:16-22).

<text>Albertus or Albert Seba (May 12, 1665, Etzel near Friedeburg – May 2, 1736, Amsterdam) was a Dutch pharmacist, zoologist, and collector. Seba accumulated one of the largest cabinets of curiosities in the Netherlands during his time. He sold one of his cabinets in 1717 to Peter the Great of Russia. His later collections were auctioned after his death. He published descriptions of his collections in a lavishly illustrated 4 volume . His early work on taxonomy and natural history influenced Linnaeus. 

==Career==
Born in Etzel, Seba moved to Amsterdam as an apprentice and, around 1700, opened a pharmacy near the harbour. Seba asked sailors and ship surgeons to bring exotic plants and animal products he could use for preparing drugs. Seba also started to collect snakes, birds, insects, shells, and lizards in his house.

From 1711, he delivered various medicines to the Russian court in Saint Petersburg and sometimes accepted fresh ginger as payment. Seba promoted his collection to Robert Erskine (1674–1719), the tsar&#x27;s head physician, and in early 1716 Peter the Great bought the complete collection. In the following several years, Seba managed to develop another collection of natural specimens, which grew more extensive than the first.

Through Seba, Frederik Ruyscha well-known Amsterdam physician and anatomistalso sold his collection to the tsar. Both collections so expanded Peter&#x27;s imperial cabinet of curiosities that they led to the establishment of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the construction of a new building for the Kunstkammer, opened in 1728 as the first Russian public museum.
In October 1728, Seba had become a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1734, he had published a Latin &quot;treasury&quot; () of animal specimens with beautiful engravings. Its full title was (&quot;A Careful Description and Exceedingly Artistic Expression in Pictures of the Exceedingly Rich Treasury of Nature Throughout the Entire History of Natural Science&quot;), traditionally shortened and abbreviated in Latin as the (&quot;A Treasury of Nature&quot;) or as Seba&#x27;s . A traditional English version of the name has been &quot;A Cabinet of Natural Curiosities&quot;, after the early modern cabinets of curiosities. The last two of the four volumes were published after his death (1759 and 1765). Today, an original 446-plate volume is in the collection of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague, Netherlands. Recently, a complete example of the sold for $460,000 at an auction. In 2001, Taschen Books published a reprint of the , with a second printing in 2006.

In 1735, Carl Linnaeus visited Seba twice. Linnaeus found Seba&#x27;s collection to be useful for the classification system which Linnaeus was developing, and Linnaeus used many of Seba&#x27;s specimens as holotypes for original descriptions of species. Seba&#x27;s inclusion of fantastic beasts such as the hydra influenced Linnaeus to include the &quot;Paradoxa&quot;, species which may exist but which have not been found, in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

Seba himself did not use Linnaeus&#x27; taxonomy, as it was published only a year before his death. However, he did organize his by physical similarities, leading to some similarities with Linnaeus&#x27; larger project.

In 1752, several years after Seba&#x27;s death, his second collection was auctioned in Amsterdam. Several objects were purchased by Russia&#x27;s Academy of Sciences.

==Taxa named in honor of Seba==
Seba is commemorated in the scientific names of two species and one subspecies of snakes: &quot;Ninia sebae&quot;, &quot;Python sebae&quot;, and &quot;Oxyrhopus petola sebae&quot;.

<doc id="1087400" wikidata="Q1778547" url="?curid=1087400" title="Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre–Masal)">
<text>The Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre–Masal) (), abbreviated CPN (UC–M) was an underground communist party in Nepal. The CPN (UC–M) was formed in 2002 through the merger of Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre) and Communist Party of Nepal (Masal).

== History ==
The merger of the two parties was announced at a public meeting on April 22, 2002, by the general secretaries of the two parties, Ram Singh Shris of CPN (Masal) and Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Prakash) of CPN (UC). The founding general secretary of CPN (UC–M) was Mohan Bikram Singh. The two electoral mass fronts of the two parties, Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal and Rastriya Janamorcha, merged to form Janamorcha Nepal. The Janamorcha Nepal joined the Seven Party Alliance and took an active part in the 2006 Loktantra Andolan.

=== Splits and dissolution ===
After the end of the direct-rule by King Gyandendra in April 2006 the CPN (Unity Centre–Masal) was split into four. A minor faction broke away and formed the Communist Party of Nepal (2006), the party later merged into the CPN (Maoist) Mohan Bikram Singh broke away and formed a parallel CPN (Unity Centre–Masal), which later renamed itself to CPN (Masal). The party also formed a parallel Janamorcha Nepal, later Rastriya Janamorcha, led by Chitra Bahadur K.C. and took away with three members of the Interim Parliament from Janamorcha Nepal because of Singh&#x27;s opposition towards joining the interim government. The other split emerged when Ram Singh Sris broke away with two members of the Interim Parliament from Janamorcha Nepal. The faction also had its own parallel Janamorcha Nepal led by Chitra Bahadur Ale. The faction later merged with other splinter groups of other communist parties and formed CPN (Unified).

After various splits in the party, Narayan Kaji Shrestha became the general secretary. The party joined the Communist Party of Nepal to form the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) on 13 January 2009. The women&#x27;s wing of CPN (UC–M) is led by Surya Thapa (president) and Anjana Bisankhe (general secretary). The students wing of CPN (UC–M) was All Nepal National Free Students Union (Unified), while the cultural wing of CPN (UC–M) was called Indreni-Raktim Cultural Family. Fronts in India included All India Nepalese Unity Society (Mainstream) and All India Nepali Students Association. The CPN (UC–M) participated in the International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter).

== Ideology ==
The CPN (Unity Centre–Masal) adhered to Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought as its ideological basis. CPN (UC–M) favoured a negotiated settlement of the Nepalese Civil War. Their proposal, put forward together with other leftists, was to hold a constituent assembly. The party also opposed US involvement in Nepal.

<doc id="1087401" wikidata="Q2335685" url="?curid=1087401" title="Leigh, Dorset">
<text>Leigh () is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England, situated approximately south-southwest of Sherborne. It is known as the site of a former Miz Maze. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 480.

==History==
One mile southeast of the village is a 10-acre enclosure called &#x27;The Castle&#x27;. The physical remnants on the ground indicate the previous existence of a castle here, although there are no historical records for the site.

Leigh has a village cross with a shaft dating from the 15th century. The parish church, dedicated to St Andrew, was previously a chapel of neighbouring Yetminster. It also dates from the 15th century, though was substantially altered—including the virtual rebuilding of the chancel—in 1854.

===Miz Maze===
In a field just south of the village are the remains of a turf labyrinth or &quot;Miz Maze&quot;, an earthwork of uncertain origin that, centuries ago, may have been used for rituals and as a meeting place. The labyrinth was laid out on banks and in the 17th century was re-cut every year by the young men of the village. It was described in 1815 in the second edition of Hutchins&#x27; &quot;History of Dorset&quot;: &quot;On an eminence in the common, about a quarter of a mile south from the village, is a maze of circular form, surrounded by a bank and ditch, and occupying an eighth part of an acre. The banks of earth of which it is composed are set almost close together, and are somewhat more than one foot in width and about half a foot in height.&quot;

Depositions from 1650–1664 state that the Miz Maze is where local witches used to meet. In 1879 the Dorset dialect poet William Barnes presented the Dorset Field Club with a paper in which he wrote &quot;Many years ago I was told by a man of this neighbourhood that a corner of Leigh Common was called &#x27;Witches Corner&#x27;; and long after that a friend gave me some old depositions on witchcraft ... one of the witches&#x27; sisterhood said that they sometimes met in Leigh Common.&quot; The last witch to be burned in England was reputed to have been arrested at a conference here in the 17th century and then executed at Maumbury Rings in Dorchester.

There used to be several of these labyrinths in Dorset, though this is the only one where traces still remain, and even here there is little evidence except for small disturbances in the grass surface which can be felt underfoot.

==Government==
The parish council has involvement in the maintenance of parish facilities and local issues such as planning applications and conservation. It works with the local police, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. Dorset Council is responsible for most of the local government services such as planning decisions and building control, local roads, council housing, markets and fairs, environmental health, refuse collection and recycling, education, social services, public transport, police and fire services, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

Leigh is in the West Dorset parliamentary constituency. Along with other villages it falls within the Cam Vale Electoral Ward.

==Geography==

Leigh is situated in the Blackmore Vale, and measured directly, the village is south-southwest of Sherborne, southeast of Yeovil and north-northwest of Dorchester. The surrounding landscape is gently undulating and predominantly agricultural. The underlying geology is Oxford clay which here produces good quality pasture; the village was once known for producing cheese and cider, with at one time every farm possessing an orchard.
One mile to the west of the village is the small Wriggle River, which drains into the River Yeo. Approximately to the south are the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs.

The nearest railway stations are on the Heart of Wessex Line at Chetnole, to the west-southwest, and Yetminster, to the northwest. The nearest main roads are the A37, to the west, and the A352, to the east.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census the parish had 225 dwellings, 209 households and a population of 480.

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2011 is shown in the table below:

In 1861 the parish population was 465.

<doc id="1087406" wikidata="Q6222061" url="?curid=1087406" title="John Black and Marlena Evans">
<text>John Black and Marlena Evans are fictional characters and a supercouple from the American daytime drama &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. John is portrayed by Drake Hogestyn and Marlena is portrayed by Deidre Hall. In magazines and in advertising, as well as on Internet message boards, the couple is often referred to by the portmanteau &quot;Jarlena&quot; (for John and Marlena) or &quot;Jolena&quot; (for John and Marlena).

==Storylines==
John and Marlena became a supercouple in 1986 on the American soap opera &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;. Drake Hogestyn (John Black) joined the show that year and his chemistry with Deidre Hall (Marlena Evans) was undeniable. At the time, Hogestyn&#x27;s character was an amnesiac named John Black. However, information (later revealed to be false) suggested that he was really Roman Brady, Marlena&#x27;s husband who was presumed dead, with extensive plastic surgery to explain the difference in appearance between the old Roman and John Black. John (as Roman) and Marlena were then married until she &quot;died&quot; in a plane crash in 1987. The pair&#x27;s romance in the 1980s was short-lived, but it left an indelible mark on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; fans and the soap opera world.

In 1991, Hall returned to &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;, and returned to her role as Dr. Marlena Evans. It was revealed that Marlena&#x27;s supposed death in the plane crash was not true and Marlena had spent the previous four years in a coma. Soon afterwards, Wayne Northrop, the original portrayer of Roman, also returned to the show. In a stunning turn of events, Drake Hogestyn remained on the show, and the story was retconned; his character was revealed to be an impostor programmed with the memories of the real Roman Brady. As a result, the fake Roman reverted to the name John Black. John still ended up becoming friends with Roman, and remained a part of his and Marlena&#x27;s lives. Marlena and Roman reunited, while John married Isabella Toscano. Isabella died shortly after, and Marlena consoled a grief-stricken John. John saved Marlena when she was kidnapped by Stella Lombard, and left for dead in a demolished warehouse. Their feelings for each other started to resurface after this. John was afraid of hurting Marlena and Roman, and decided to leave town to avoid acting on his feelings. Marlena boarded his private jet, though, and the two gave into their feelings, sharing a night of passion. The two embarked on a passionate and torrid affair, which was discovered by Marlena and Roman&#x27;s daughter, Sami Brady.

Marlena later found out she was pregnant, and John asked for a blood test to determine the paternity, which said he was not the father. When Marlena went into labor, John delivered her baby girl, Belle. When Belle was kidnapped, John rescued her from Sami, who tried to sell her on the black market. At Belle&#x27;s christening, Roman found out about John and Marlena&#x27;s affair, and was furious. Marlena found out that Sami had switched Belle&#x27;s paternity test, and John was actually Belle&#x27;s father. Marlena moved out with Belle, and she and Roman divorced. John provided Marlena and Belle a place to stay while she was working out the divorce. Though their feelings were strong, John and Marlena were too guilt-ridden by their past mistakes to think about starting a relationship.

When Marlena was possessed, John helped perform an exorcism when he was led to believe he was a priest. He was successful, and Marlena was saved. He left the priesthood, and started a relationship with Kristen Blake, the adopted daughter of John and Marlena&#x27;s worst enemy, Stefano DiMera. However, the pull between Marlena and John remained there. Kristen eventually became insecure, and hatched scheme after scheme to keep Marlena and John apart. John found out, and eventually broke up with her, and reunited with Marlena. Though the two were together, circumstances out of their control separated them again. Their love prevailed, though, and John and Marlena wed on July 5, 1999.

The couple faced many obstacles in their married life that included a brainwashed Hope Brady seducing John and becoming pregnant, though the child was later proven not to be John&#x27;s, the feud between John&#x27;s son, Brady and Marlena (later resolved), Marlena being brainwashed into believing she was a serial killer, and Marlena becoming pregnant with Roman&#x27;s child, and later miscarrying the baby; Marlena develops amnesia, as a result.

In 2005, amnesia specialist Alex North came to town, later revealing himself to be Marlena&#x27;s real husband from college. Marlena became torn between Alex and John and, due to John&#x27;s raging jealousy and Alex&#x27;s manipulations, especially his drugs, Marlena chose Alex. However, John did not give up on his love and did everything to try to win her back. However, even when it seemed that he was making headway, his drugs and manipulations enabled Alex to keep winning. The struggle continued to Morgan Island during Alex and Marlena&#x27;s honeymoon in May 2006, after they had renewed their vows. During a fight on Morgan Island, Alex died.

Newly clearheaded, Marlena realized that Alex had been abusive during their marriage. She decided that she needed a little time to get back on her feet. Without any hard feelings, and with their love as strong as ever, Marlena chose to separate from John for a while, and she took a job in New Jersey. When it was discovered that Marlena was missing, however, John began to search for his love. With the help of Abe Carver, John rescued Marlena from a trunk in which she&#x27;d been held captive, in early October 2006. The couple&#x27;s next obstacle, in December 2006, was fighting against Stefano DiMera&#x27;s son EJ DiMera, who was sent by Stefano to kill John.

John and Marlena married for the third time (their first legal marriage) on December 5, 2006. However, none of the couple&#x27;s children ( Eric, Sami, Brady or Belle) could attend. After being presumably shot by EJ, John fell into a coma. Marlena remained by his side, praying that he would wake up; he did wake up in May 2007. Also, John discovered that he was the son of Colleen Brady and Santo DiMera, thus making him the half-brother of his worst enemy Stefano DiMera. On October 17, John was a victim of a hit and run case, with the culprit remaining a mystery. John was taken into emergency, but apparently died peacefully in the arms of Marlena, his greatest love of all time. It was later discovered that his death was faked by Stefano.

Once again, John came back to Salem as Stefano&#x27;s pawn and had no memory of his love for Marlena or his family (January 2008).

The couple endured a divorce due to John&#x27;s inability to regain his memory and decision to live a life below Marlena&#x27;s moral standards. When John regained his memory after a traumatic incident that left him temporarily (at least) paralyzed, John and Marlena reunited and were remarried before leaving the show on January 23, 2009.

John and Marlena (Drake and Deidre) returned to Days of our Lives on September 26, 2011 to celebrate the re-opening of the Horton Town Square. However, shortly after their arrival, John was arrested on embezzlement and corporate fraud charges. At first, John believed he was innocent but due to strong memory flashes, he quickly second guessed himself unaware that Stefano&#x27;s son EJ has framed him for the crimes. When a rogue ex-cop fires shots into the Brady Pub where John, Marlena, Roman, Bo, Hope, Sami, Rafe, Caroline, and the kids are all present and when Johnny goes missing, John decides to plead guilty. On November 23, 2011, John is sentenced to 50 years in prison without the possibility of parole, equivalent to a life sentence. On December 23, 2011, Carrie and Rafe managed to find the evidence that would clear John&#x27;s name. He was released and John and Marlena were reunited.

==Reception and impact==
In December 2008, &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; announced Deidre Hall (Marlena) and Drake Hogestyn (John) were departing from the series. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; reported that the news &quot;not only rocked the daytime world, it made headline in the mainstream press.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Opera Digest 01/27/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the week of their departure, the magazine published a collector&#x27;s edition issue which featured the Hogestyn and Hall on the cover. Inside, the fan responses were printed as well as the story of the actors&#x27; dismissal and a time line of the fictional pairing&#x27;s storylines. Fans of John and Marlena purchased a full-page ad in this issue thanking Hogestyn and Hall for twenty years of portraying the pairing as a couple.

==Awards==
Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn were nominated for a &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; award for &quot;Hottest Romance&quot; in 1998 and won a &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; award for &quot;Favorite Couple&quot; in 2005 for their portrayal of Marlena and John.

<text>Ethel May Dell Savage (2 August 1881 – 17 September 1939), known by her pen name, Ethel M. Dell, was a British writer of over 30 popular romance novels and several short stories from 1911 to 1939.

==Biography==
Dell was born on 2 August 1881 to a middle class family in Streatham, a suburb of London, England. Her father was a clerk in the City of London and she had an older sister and brother. Dell began to write stories while very young and many of them were published in popular magazines. Her stories were mainly romantic in nature, set in the British Raj and other old British colonial possessions. Her stories were considered by some to be overly sexual. Her cousins were known to tally the number of times she used the words passion, tremble, pant and thrill. 

Dell worked on &quot;The Way of an Eagle&quot;, her first novel, for several years, finally publishing it under T. Fisher Unwin after being rejected eight times by other publishers. The book was included in Unwin&#x27;s First Novel Library, a series which highlighted a writer&#x27;s first book. &quot;The Way of an Eagle&quot; was published in 1911 and had gone through thirty printings by 1915.

In 1922, Ethel married a soldier, Lieutenant-Colonel Gerald Tahourdin Savage, who resigned his commission at his marriage, making Dell the sole support of the family. Despite unfavorable reviews from critics, she developed a strong fan base, earning from £20,000 to £30,000 a year. Her husband devoted himself to her and fiercely guarded her privacy. Dell continued writing, eventually producing about thirty novels and several volumes of short stories over the course of her life.

Dell died of cancer on 17 September 1939 at age 58.

Pictures of her are very rare and she was never interviewed by the press.

==References in literature==
The protagonist of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; makes several negative comments about Dell and other authors (notably Warwick Deeping), specifically mentioning &quot;The Way of an Eagle&quot;. He also refers to her in the 1936 essay &quot;Bookshop Memories&quot; and in his answers to &quot;The Cost of Letters&quot; (1946), a questionnaire on the subject of earning a living by writing.

Noël Coward, in the introduction to &quot;Three Plays,&quot; writes, “There will always be a public for the Cinderella story, the same as there will always be a public for Miss Ethel M. Dell and the Girls Companion. In the world of amusement it is essential for someone to cater for the illiterate ...”

The titular character of Winifred Watson&#x27;s novel &quot;Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day&quot; refers to Dell as the source of her inspiration to encourage a young gentleman to punch a rival by hissing, &quot;Sock him one&quot; at the key moment.

In Richard Hughes&#x27;s &quot;In Hazard&quot;, the engineer Souter aboard the steamer &quot;Archimedes&quot; has a nightmare about the late chief engineer who was lost at sea. Rather than try to sleep, he begins to read a book by Ethel M. Dell.

P. G. Wodehouse refers to Dell in several stories and in the novel &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot; (1948).
D.H. Lawrence mentions Dell in the second draft of &quot;The First Lady Chatterley&quot; (Mondadori 1954), published as &quot;John Thomas and Lady Jane&quot; in 1972.

In Cornelia Otis Skinner&#x27;s popular &quot;Our Hearts Were Young and Gay&quot; (1942), the narrator says her travel-mate was well read but that she herself &quot;had a secret letch for Ethel M. Dell.&quot;

In M. John Harrison&#x27;s novel &quot;The Centauri Device&quot;, &quot;a calf-bound set of Ethel M. Dell firsts, signed and numbered by the author&quot; are part of the detritus of the 20th Century arranged with other &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; at a narcotics party on 24th century Earth.

In Gladys Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;The Saltmarsh Murders&quot;, the curate mentions Ethel M. Dell.

In Dorothy Sayers&#x27;s novel &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club&quot;, first published in 1928, Ethel M. Dell is mentioned as an example of escapist literature. &quot;Servants and factory girls read about beautiful girls loved by dark, handsome men, all covered over with jewels and moving in scenes of gilded splendour. And passionate spinsters read Ethel M. Dell. And dull men in offices read detective stories.&quot;

Kenneth Halliwell and Joe Orton &#x27;interfered&#x27; with the cover of a library copy of &quot;Storm Drift&quot;. This defacement is, at first glance, designed to affront &quot;Romance&quot; writing but the complexity of this collage and that of many other library books carried out between 1960 and April, 1962 has yet to be completely unravelled.

Ogden Nash mentions her by name in his poem, &quot;I Always Say A Good Saint Is No Worse Than A Bad Cold.&quot;

<doc id="1087430" wikidata="Q340727" url="?curid=1087430" title="180-degree rule">
<text>In filmmaking, the 180-degree rule is a guideline regarding the on-screen spatial relationship between a character and another character or object within a scene. The rule states that the camera should be kept on one side of an imaginary axis between two characters, so that the first character is always frame right of the second character. Moving the camera over the axis is called &quot;jumping the line&quot; or &quot;crossing the line&quot;; breaking the 180-degree rule by shooting on all sides is known as shooting in the round.

The 180-degree rule enables the viewer to visually connect with unseen movement happening around and behind the immediate subject and is particularly important in the narration of battle scenes.

==Examples==
In a dialogue scene between two characters, a straight line can be imagined running through the two characters. If the camera remains on one side of this line, the spatial relationship between the two characters will be consistent from shot to shot. Shifting to the other side of the characters on a cut will reverse the order of the characters from left to right and may disorient the viewer.

The rule also applies to the movement of a character as the &quot;line&quot; created by the path of the character. For example, if a character is walking in a leftward direction and is to be picked up by another camera, the character must exit the first shot on frame left and enter the next shot frame right.

A jump cut can be utilized to denote time. If a character leaves the frame on the left side and enters the frame on the left in a different location, it can give the illusion of an extended amount of time passing.

Another example could be a car chase: If a vehicle leaves the right side of the frame in one shot, it should enter from the left side of the frame in the next shot. Leaving from the right and entering from the right creates a similar sense of disorientation as in the dialogue example.

==Reverse cuts==
The imaginary line allows viewers to orient themselves with the position and direction of action in a scene. If a shot following an earlier shot in a sequence is located on the opposite side of the 180-degree line, then it is called a &quot;reverse cut&quot;. Reverse cuts disorient the viewer by presenting an opposing viewpoint of the action in a scene and consequently altering the perspective of the action and the spatial orientation established in the original shot.

There are a variety of ways to avoid confusion related to crossing the line due to particular situations caused by actions or situations in a scene that would necessitate breaking the 180-degree line. The movement in the scene can be altered, or cameras set up on one side of the scene so that all the shots reflect the view from that side of the 180-degree line.

Another way to allow for crossing the line is to have several shots with the camera arching from one side of the line to the other during the scene. That shot can be used to orient the viewer to the fact that they are looking at the scene from another angle. In the case of movement, if a character is seen walking into frame from behind on the left side walking towards a building corner on the right, as they walk around the corner of the building, the camera can catch them coming towards the camera on the other side of the building entering the frame from the left side and then walk straight at the camera and then exit the left side of the frame.

To minimize the &quot;jolt&quot; between shots in a sequence on either sides of the 180-degree line, a buffer shot can be included along the 180-degree line separating each side. This lets the viewer visually comprehend the change in viewpoint expressed in the sequence.

==Style==
In professional productions, the applied 180-degree rule is an essential element for a style of film editing called continuity editing. The rule is not always obeyed. Sometimes a filmmaker purposely breaks the line of action to create disorientation. Carl Theodor Dreyer did this in &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot;; Stanley Kubrick also did this, for example, in the bathroom scene in &quot;The Shining&quot;. Directors Jacques Demy, Tinto Brass, Yasujirō Ozu, Wong Kar-wai, and Jacques Tati have also ignored this rule sometimes, as has Lars von Trier in &quot;Antichrist&quot;. In the seminal French New Wave film &quot;À bout de souffle&quot; (&quot;Breathless&quot;), Jean-Luc Godard breaks the rule in the first five minutes in a car scene which jumps between the front and back seats, improvising an &quot;aesthetic rebellion&quot; for which the New Wave would become known. When the rule is broken accidentally, or for a technical reason (such as the inability to place a camera physically in the correct position), there are techniques which may be employed to attempt to hide it. For example, the editor may pre-lap a word or two of dialog prior to the cut, so that the viewer will concentrate on what is being said as a distraction from the breaking of cinematic convention.

Some styles used with the 180-degree rule can elicit an emotion or create a visual rhythm. By moving the camera closer to the axis for a close-up shot, it can amp up the intensity of a scene when paired with a long shot. When the camera is moved further away from the axis for a long shot after a close-up shot, it may provide a break in the action of the scene.

In the Japanese anime feature &quot;Paprika&quot;, two of the main characters discuss, and demonstrate, the disorientating effect of crossing the line.

==Empirical research==

Empirical evidence exploring the importance of maintaining the 180-degree rule is limited. The basic premise is that abiding by the rule helps keep characters on the correct side of the screen. Thus, it is assumed that if the rule is violated, it can lead to distraction and disrupt the flow of the moment. This is then extrapolated to affect the rhythm, or emotions of the scene. However, these notions are rooted in filmmakers&#x27; subjective reports, rather than empirical evidence.

Some research has demonstrated that crossing the line can negatively affect the accuracy of spatial representation of the scene. Furthermore, flipping the characters&#x27; positions can disrupt the viewer&#x27;s understanding of the relative orientations on screen. Violations appear to also affect spatial memory for the location of objects in a scene, but they do not affect memory for the narrative, the order of unfolding events, nor the understanding of narrative flow.

Broadly speaking, empirical research indicates that abiding by the 180-degree rule is not necessary in a practical sense. Accurate spatial representations may not be important for the scene, nor are they remembered across the longer duration of a movie. Furthermore, more recent research has demonstrated that while viewers can spot violations, the presence of these violations has a negligible effect on the enjoyment of the scene or movie.

<doc id="1087434" wikidata="Q136842" url="?curid=1087434" title="Porbeagle">
<text>The porbeagle or porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) is a species of mackerel shark in the family Lamnidae, distributed widely in the cold and temperate marine waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere. In the North Pacific, its ecological equivalent is the closely related salmon shark (&quot;L. ditropis&quot;). It typically reaches in length and a weight of ; North Atlantic sharks grow larger than Southern Hemisphere sharks and differ in coloration and aspects of life history. Gray above and white below, the porbeagle has a very stout midsection that tapers towards the long, pointed snout and the narrow base of the tail. It has large pectoral and first dorsal fins, tiny pelvic, second dorsal, and anal fins, and a crescent-shaped caudal fin. The most distinctive features of this species are its three-cusped teeth, the white blotch at the aft base of its first dorsal fin, and the two pairs of lateral keels on its tail.

The porbeagle is an opportunistic hunter that preys mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods throughout the water column, including the bottom. Most commonly found over food-rich banks on the outer continental shelf, it makes occasional forays both close to shore and into the open ocean to a depth of . It also conducts long-distance seasonal migrations, generally shifting between shallower and deeper water. The porbeagle is fast and highly active, with physiological adaptations that enable it to maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. It can be solitary or gregarious, and has been known to perform seemingly playful behavior. This shark is aplacental viviparous with oophagy, developing embryos being retained within the mother&#x27;s uterus and subsisting on non-viable eggs. Females typically bear four pups every year.

Only a few shark attacks of uncertain provenance have been attributed to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as vulnerable worldwide, and as either endangered or critically endangered in different parts of its northern range.

==Taxonomy==

The etymology of the word &quot;porbeagle&quot; is obscure. A common suggestion is that it combines &quot;porpoise&quot; and &quot;beagle&quot;, referencing this shark&#x27;s shape and tenacious hunting habits. Another is that it is derived from the Cornish &quot;porth&quot;, meaning &quot;harbor&quot;, and &quot;bugel&quot;, meaning &quot;shepherd&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the word was either borrowed from Cornish or formed from a Cornish first element with the English &quot;beagle&quot;. The &quot;Dictionary&quot; also notes that no evidence exists for a connection to the French &quot;porc&quot;, meaning &quot;swine&quot;, or to &quot;porpoise&quot;, as has been proposed. Other common names for the porbeagle include Atlantic mackerel shark, Beaumaris shark, bottle-nosed shark, and blue dog.

The first scientific description of the porbeagle was authored by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 &quot;Tableau encyclopédique et methodique des trois règnes de la nature&quot;, and based on an earlier 1769 account by Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. Bonnaterre named the shark &quot;Squalus nasus&quot;, the specific epithet &quot;nasus&quot; being Latin for &quot;nose&quot;. In 1816, French naturalist Georges Cuvier placed the porbeagle into its own subgenus, &quot;Lamna&quot;, which later authors elevated to the rank of full genus.

==Phylogeny and evolution==
Several phylogenetic studies, based on morphological characters and mitochondrial DNA sequences, have established the sister species relationship between the porbeagle and the salmon shark (&quot;L. ditropis&quot;), which occurs in place of it in the North Pacific. The genus &quot;Lamna&quot; evolved 65–45 Mya. When its two extant species diverged from each other is uncertain, though the precipitating event was likely the formation of the ice cap over the Arctic Ocean, which would have isolated sharks in the North Pacific from those in the North Atlantic.

Fossilized porbeagle remains are known from Late Miocene epoch (about 7.2 Mya) deposits in Belgium and the Netherlands, Pliocene epoch (5.3–2.6 Mya) deposits in Belgium, Spain, and Chile, and Pleistocene epoch (2.6 Mya to 12,000 BP) deposits in the Netherlands. However, &quot;Lamna&quot; teeth that closely resemble those of the porbeagle have been found in the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, which date to the middle to late Eocene epoch (50–34 Mya). Much taxonomic confusion remains regarding &quot;Lamna&quot; in the fossil record due to the high degree of variability in adult tooth morphology within species.

==Distribution and habitat==
The porbeagle has an almost global amphitemperate distribution, i.e., it is absent from the tropics; in the North Pacific, its niche is assumed by the salmon shark. It is found mostly within 30–70°N and 30–50°S latitudes. In the North Atlantic, the northern limit of its range extends from the Newfoundland Grand Banks off Canada, through southern Greenland, to Scandinavia and Russia; the southern limit of its range extends from New Jersey and Bermuda, through the Azores and Madeira, to Morocco. It is found in the Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea. Normally, North Atlantic sharks only stray as far south as South Carolina and the Gulf of Guinea, but pregnant females from the western North Atlantic population are known to range into the Sargasso Sea, almost as far as Hispaniola, to give birth. In the Southern Hemisphere, the porbeagle apparently occupies a continuous band bound in the south by the Antarctic Convergence, and extending as far north as Chile and Brazil, the Western Cape province of South Africa, Australia to southern Western Australia and southern Queensland, and New Zealand. In New Zealand it is most common south of the Cook Strait. The porbeagle is thought to have colonized the Southern Hemisphere during the Quaternary glaciation (beginning around 2.6 Mya), when the tropical climate zone was much narrower than it is today.

Offshore fishing banks are the favored habitat of the porbeagle, though it can be found from a depth of in oceanic basins to littoral (close to shore) waters less than deep, over the entire water column. A single, anomalous record was made of a juvenile in brackish water in Mar Chiquita in Argentina. A tracking study off the British Isles has found substantial variation in the short-term movements of this species, both between and within individuals. Vertical movements tended to increase with water depth and corresponding temperature stratification; in shallow, unstratified waters, sharks either showed no pattern in changing depth or made reverse diel movements, spending the day in shallow water and descending at night. In deeper, stratified waters, the sharks performed a regular diel migration, spending the day below the thermocline and rising towards the surface at night. The porbeagle has been reported across a temperature range of , with most records between . In a study that included 420 porbeagles caught in the northwest Atlantic off Canada, all were in water below and the majority between .

Porbeagle populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres appear to be completely separate. Two stocks are in the North Atlantic, east and west, that seldom mix; only one individual is known to have crossed the Atlantic, covering from Ireland to Canada. Several discrete stocks are likely present in the Southern Hemisphere, as well. This species segregates by size and sex in the North Atlantic, and at least by size in the South Pacific. For example, males outnumber females 2:1 off Spain, females are 30% more numerous than males off Scotland, and immature males are predominant in the Bristol Channel. Older, larger sharks may frequent higher latitudes than younger individuals.

Seasonal migrations have been observed in porbeagles from both hemispheres. In the western North Atlantic, much of the population spends the spring in the deep waters of the Nova Scotia continental shelf, and migrates north a distance of to spend late summer and fall in the shallow waters of the Newfoundland Grand Banks and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In December, large, mature females migrate south over into the Sargasso Sea for pupping, keeping deeper than during the day and at night so as to stay in the cooler waters beneath the Gulf Stream. In the eastern North Atlantic, porbeagles are believed to spend spring and summer in shallow continental shelf waters, and disperse northwards to overwinter in deeper waters offshore. Migrating sharks may travel upwards of , though once they reach their destination they tend to remain within a relatively localized area. In the South Pacific, the population shifts north past 30°S latitude into subtropical waters in winter and spring, and retreats south past 35°S latitude in summer, when sharks are frequently sighted off subantarctic islands.

==Description==

The porbeagle is a very stout-bodied shark with a fusiform (spindle-like) shape. The long, conical snout tapers to a sharp point, and is supported by enlarged, highly calcified cartilages. The eyes are large and black, without nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The small, S-shaped nostrils are positioned in front of and below the level of the eyes. The mouth is large and strongly curved, with moderately protrusible jaws. North Atlantic sharks have 28–29 upper tooth rows and 26–27 lower tooth rows, while Southern Hemisphere sharks have 30–31 upper tooth rows and 27–29 lower tooth rows. Each tooth has a strongly arched base and a nearly straight, awl-like central cusp, which is flanked by a pair of smaller cusplets in all but the smallest individuals. The five pairs of gill slits are long and precede the pectoral fin bases.

The pectoral fins are long and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) are at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch is near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.

The dorsal coloration is a medium to dark gray or slate, extending to the bases of the pectoral fins. The underside is white; adults in the Southern Hemisphere often have dark coloring under the head and dusky blotches scattered over the belly. The free rear tip of the first dorsal fin is abruptly light gray or white, a feature unique to this species. The porbeagle may attain a length of , though this is uncertain and may have resulted from confusion with other mackerel shark species. A more typical length is . Female sharks grow larger than males in the North Atlantic, with maximum confirmed fork lengths (snout tip to caudal fin fork) of for males and for females. Southern Hemisphere sharks are smaller and the two sexes are similar in size, with males and females attaining fork lengths of respectively. Most porbeagles weigh no more than , with the record being a individual caught off Caithness, Scotland, in 1993.

==Biology and ecology==

Fast and energetic, the porbeagle can be found singly or in groups. Its fusiform body, narrow caudal peduncle with lateral keels, and crescent-shaped tail are adaptations for efficiently sustaining speed, which have also been independently evolved by tunas, billfishes, and several other groups of active fishes. The salmon shark and it are the thickest-bodied members of their family (length-depth ratio approaching 4.5), and consequently have the stiffest swimming style; they oscillate their tails while holding their bodies mostly rigid, which confers propulsive power with high energy efficiency, but at the cost of maneuverability. The large gill surface area of the porbeagle allows more oxygen to be delivered to its tissues. It also has a short band of aerobic &quot;red muscle&quot; along each side, which can contract independently of the regular &quot;white muscle&quot; at a lower energy cost, enhancing the shark&#x27;s stamina.

Porbeagles are among the few fishes that exhibit apparent play behavior. Reports, principally off the Cornish coast, have this species rolling and repeatedly wrapping themselves in long kelp fronds near the surface; this activity may have an exploratory or self-stimulatory purpose, though alternately, the sharks may be attempting to feed on small kelp organisms or scrape off parasites. In addition, porbeagles within a group have been seen chasing each other, and they will reportedly &quot;play with anything floating on the water&quot;; individuals have been observed prodding, tossing, or biting natural and artificial objects, including pieces of driftwood and balloon floats used by anglers.

Great white sharks (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;) and killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle. In one record, a small individual caught off Argentina bore bite marks from a copper shark (&quot;Carcharhinus brachyurus&quot;) or similar species, but whether the porbeagle was the target of attempted predation or if the two were simply involved in interspecific aggression is uncertain. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms &quot;Dinobothrium septaria&quot; and &quot;Hepatoxylon trichiuri&quot;, and the copepods &quot;Dinemoura producta&quot;, &quot;Laminifera doello-juradoi&quot;, and &quot;Pandarus floridanus&quot;. Natural annual mortality is low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.

===Feeding===

The porbeagle is an active predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cusk, haddock, redfish (i.e., &quot;Sebastes&quot;, &quot;Lutjanus&quot;, Trachichthyidae, and Berycidae), cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, lumpsuckers, and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form an important component of its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (&quot;Squalus acanthias&quot;) and tope sharks (&quot;Galeorhinus galeus&quot;) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.

In the western North Atlantic, porbeagles feed mainly on pelagic fishes and squid in spring, and on groundfishes in the fall; this pattern corresponds to the spring-fall migration of these sharks from deeper to shallower waters, and the most available prey types in those respective habitats. Therefore, the porbeagle seems to be an opportunistic predator without strong diet specificity. During spring and summer in the Celtic Sea and on the outer Nova Scotian Shelf, porbeagles congregate at tidally induced thermal fronts to feed on fish that have been drawn by high concentrations of zooplankton. Hunting porbeagles regularly dive from the surface all the way to the bottom, cycling back every few hours; this vertical movement may aid in the detection of olfactory cues. A one-year-old porbeagle long, was reported to have had fed on krill and polychaete worms.

===Life history===

The timing of the porbeagle&#x27;s reproductive cycle is unusual in that it is largely similar in both hemispheres, rather than being offset by six months. This suggests that its reproduction is not significantly affected by temperature or day length, perhaps owing to its endothermic physiology. Mating takes place mainly between September and November, though females with fresh mating scars have been reported as late as January off the Shetland Islands. The male bites at the female&#x27;s pectoral fins, gill region, and flanks while courting and to hold on for copulation. Two mating grounds are known for western North Atlantic porbeagles, one off Newfoundland and the other on Georges Bank in the Gulf of Maine. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteri. They probably reproduce every year. The litter size is typically four, with two embryos oriented in opposing directions sharing each uterus; on rare occasions, a litter may contain as few as one or as many as five pups. The gestation period is 8–9 months.

Like other members of its family, the porbeagle is aplacental viviparous with oophagy, i.e. the main source of embryonic nutrition are unfertilized eggs. During the first half of pregnancy, the mother ovulates enormous numbers of tiny ova, packed into capsules up to long, into her uteri. A newly conceived embryo is sustained by a yolk sac and emerges from its egg capsule at long. At this time, the embryo has well-developed external gills and a spiral valve intestine. When the embryo is long, it has resorbed its external gills and most of its yolk sac, but cannot yet feed, as it lacks the means to open egg capsules. At a length of , the embryo grows two massive, recurved &quot;fangs&quot; in the lower jaw for tearing open capsules, as well as two much smaller teeth in the upper jaw. It begins to feed voraciously on yolk, acquiring an enormously distended stomach; to accommodate this, the muscles on the belly split down the middle and the skin on the abdomen stretches greatly.

At long, the embryo appears pink because it lacks pigment except in its eyes, and its head and gill regions are laterally enlarged and gelatinous. The yolk stomach can comprise up to 81% of the embryo&#x27;s total weight when it is long. The embryo gains pigment and sheds its fangs at a length of . Around this time, the mother stops producing ova. From then on, the embryo relies mainly on the yolk stored in its stomach, though it may continue to feed on remaining eggs by squishing the capsules between its jaws or swallowing them whole. It begins to transfer its energy stores from its stomach to its liver, causing the former to shrink and the latter to grow exponentially. The embryo is essentially fully pigmented by a length of , and has assumed its newborn appearance by a length of . By then, its stomach has shrunk enough for the abdominal muscles to close, leaving what has been termed an &quot;umbilical scar&quot; or &quot;yolk sac scar&quot; (neither is accurate). Several series of single-cusped teeth grow in both jaws, though they lie flat and remain nonfunctional until birth.
Newborn porbeagles measure long and do not exceed . Up to a tenth of the weight is made up of the liver, though some yolk also remains in its stomach and continues to sustain the pup until it learns to feed. The overall embryonic growth rate is per month. Sometimes, one pup in a uterus is much smaller than the other, but otherwise normal. These &quot;runts&quot; may result from a dominant, forward-facing embryo eating most of the eggs as they arrive, and/or the mother being unable to provide an adequate egg supply for all her offspring. Birthing occurs from April to September, peaking in April and May (spring-summer) for North Atlantic sharks and June and July (winter) for Southern Hemisphere sharks. In the western North Atlantic, birth occurs well offshore in the Sargasso Sea at depths around .

Both sexes grow at similar rates until the onset of maturation, with females maturing later and at a larger size than males. In the first four years of life, the annual growth rate is and similar in both hemispheres; thereafter, sharks from the western South Pacific begin to grow slower than those from the North Atlantic. In the North Atlantic, males mature at a fork length of and an age of 6–11 years, and females at a fork length of and an age of 12–18 years. In the Southwest Pacific, males mature at a fork length of and an age of 8–11 years, and females at a fork length of and an age of 15–18 years. The oldest porbeagle on record was 26 years of age and measured long. The maximum lifespan of this species appears to be 30–40 years in the Atlantic, but could be as much as 65 years in the South Pacific.

===Thermoregulation===

Like other members of its family, the porbeagle is endothermic; metabolic heat generated by its red muscles is conserved within the body by specialized systems of blood vessels called &quot;retia mirabilia&quot; (Latin for &quot;wonderful nets&quot;; singular &quot;rete mirabile&quot;), that act as highly efficient countercurrent heat exchangers. The porbeagle has several &quot;rete mirabile&quot; systems: the orbital &quot;retia&quot; accessing its brain and eyes, the lateral cutaneous &quot;retia&quot; accessing its swimming muscles, the suprahepatic &quot;rete&quot; accessing its viscera, and the kidney &quot;rete&quot;.

Among sharks, the porbeagle&#x27;s capacity for elevating body temperature is second only to the salmon shark&#x27;s. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral &quot;rete&quot; is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It has one of the highest core temperatures within its family, warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital &quot;retia&quot; of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by , and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.

==Human interactions==
The porbeagle has very rarely, if ever, bitten swimmers or boats. As of 2009, the International Shark Attack File attributes three bites to this species, one provoked and none fatal, and two on boats. One older anecdote tells of a fisherman who provoked a porbeagle into leaping from the water and tearing his clothes. In another account of a swimmer bitten by a &quot;mackerel shark&quot;, the species responsible could easily have been a misidentified shortfin mako or great white shark. Recently in the North Sea, adult porbeagles have been filmed charging at divers working on oil platforms, sometimes even brushing lightly against them without doing harm. These rushes do not appear to have predatory intent and may instead be motivated by curiosity or defense.

On 14 May 2018, a porbeagle shark was reported to have bitten a fisherman off the coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom, as it was being returned to the sea.

At one time, porbeagles were regarded as nuisances by some commercial fishers because they damaged lighter fishing gear intended for smaller species and took hooked fish from lines. This shark is highly valued as a game fish by sport fishers in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It fights strongly on hook-and-line, but does not usually jump into the air like the related shortfin mako shark. Novice anglers often mistake this shark for the mako, which has earned it the affectionate moniker &quot;fako&quot; in New England. The International Game Fish Association keeps records on the porbeagle.

===Commercial fishing===

Prized for its meat and fins, the porbeagle has long been under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998, it had a wholesale price of 5–7 eur/kg, four times that of the blue shark (&quot;Prionace glauca&quot;). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be used for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified, as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared, it may be finned and the carcass discarded.

Intensive fishing for the porbeagle dates back the 1930s, when Norway and to a lesser extent Denmark began operating longline vessels in the Northeast Atlantic. The Norwegian annual catch rose from 279 tons in 1926 to 3,884 tons in 1933, and peaked at around 6,000 tons in 1947, with the resumption of fishing after World War II. Soon after, the stock collapsed; Norwegian annual catches declined steadily to 1,200–1,900 tons from 1953 to 1960, 160–300 tons in the early 1970s, and 10–40 tons in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similarly, Danish annual catches fell from 1,500 tons in the early 1950s to under 100 tons in the 1990s. France and Spain began to target porbeagles in the Northeast Atlantic in the 1970s. French fishers operate mainly in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, and saw a decline from an annual catch over 1,000 tons in 1979 to 300–400 tons in the late 1990s. Catches by Spanish fishers were highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 4,000 tons per year, which may reflect shifts of fishing effort into historically less-exploited waters. Since 2011, all fishing for the porbeagle has been illegal in waters of the European Union, and EU-registered vessels are also prohibited from fishing for the species in international waters. In 2012, similar restriction came into effect in Norway.

As porbeagles had become scarce in the Northeast Atlantic, in the 1960s, the Norwegian fishing fleet moved west to the waters off New England and Newfoundland. A few years later, they were joined by longline vessels from the Faroe Islands. Norwegian annual catches rose from 1,900 tons in 1961 to over 9,000 tons in 1965; the catch was largely exported to Italy, where porbeagle (&quot;smeriglio&quot;) is an extremely popular food fish. Again, the stock collapsed, this time in only six years; by 1970, Norwegian catches had fallen under 1,000 tons per year, and Faroese catches observed a similar trend. With the population decimated, most fishers moved on or switched to other species. Porbeagle numbers gradually recovered in the ensuing 25 years, to about 30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, Canada established an Exclusive Economic Zone and became the primary fisher of porbeagles in the region. Between 1994 and 1998, Canadian fishing vessels landed 1,000–2,000 tons per year, which depleted the population to 11–17% of pre-exploitation levels by 2000. Strict regulations and greatly reduced fishing quotas introduced in 2000 have since begun to reverse the stock decline, though recovery of the stock is projected to take decades due to the low productivity of the species. Some evidence shows that incidental artificial selection caused by heavy fishing has led to a compensatory growth response, i.e. faster growth and earlier maturation.

In the Southern Hemisphere, commercial fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable species such as southern bluefin tuna (&quot;Thunnus maccoyii&quot;), swordfish (&quot;Xiphias gladius&quot;), and Patagonian toothfish (&quot;Dissostichus eleginoides&quot;), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits is uncertain. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.

==Conservation==

The rapid collapse of porbeagle stocks on both sides of the North Atlantic is often cited as archetypal of the &quot;boom and bust&quot; pattern of most shark fisheries. Factors including a small litter size, long maturation time, and the capture of multiple age classes all contribute to this shark&#x27;s susceptibility to overfishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the porbeagle globally as vulnerable, endangered in the western North Atlantic (including the Baltic), and critically endangered in the eastern North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.

The porbeagle is listed on Annex 1 (Highly Migratory Species) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and on Annex 1 of the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS; also known as the Bonn Convention) Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding. This species benefits from bans on shark finning instituted by several nations and supranational entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. Although the Animals Committee of the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. In March 2013, the porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of CITES, allowing for increased regulation in the international trade of this species.

In March 2015, The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) responded to a court order to compile information as to whether the shark will be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

=== Southern Hemisphere ===
The only regulation of porbeagle catches in the Southern Hemisphere is New Zealand&#x27;s total allowable catch of 249 tons per year, instituted in 2004. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the porbeagle as &quot;Not Threatened&quot; with the qualifier &quot;Threatened Overseas&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

=== Eastern North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea ===
In the eastern North Atlantic, porbeagle fishing has been illegal in waters of the European Union since 2011. From 1985 and until the EU ban, the Faroe Islands and Norway (which are not members of the EU) were allowed annual quotas of 200 tons and 125 tons, respectively, from European Community waters. Although these quotas were lower than the originals set in 1982 (500 tons for Norway and 300 tons for the Faroe Islands), they were still consistently higher than the yearly total porbeagle catch in the region, thus had no practical effect. The species is included on the red list of Norway and it has been protected in their national waters since 2012. Any porbeagle caught in EU or Norwegian waters by accident must be released.

In the Mediterranean Sea, the porbeagle is on the verge of extinction, with a population decline over 99.99% since the mid-20th century. Its range has contracted to the waters around the Italian Peninsula, where a nursery area may exist. Only a few dozen specimens have been recorded in the past few decades, from scientific surveys, swordfish fishery bycatch, and sport fishers. In 1995, it was included in Annex III (&quot;species whose exploitation is regulated&quot;) of the Barcelona Convention Protocol on protected areas and biodiversity in the Mediterranean, which has not been ratified. In 1997, it was listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). However, these listings have yet to result in the implementation of new management plans, despite the recognized need for urgent action.

The European Union prohibits EU vessels from fishing for, retaining, boarding, transhipping, or landing porbeagle sharks in all waters since January 2011. It is subject to a zero total allowable catch in EU waters by any vessel.

=== Western North Atlantic ===
The western North Atlantic porbeagle population has a more positive prospect than in the eastern North Atlantic. Fishing in Canadian waters was originally regulated by the 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada, which established an annual quota of 1,500 tons, restricted the time, place, and gear types allowed for commercial fishing, and set limits for bycatch and recreational fishing. In 2000–2001, Fisheries and Oceans Canada prepared a detailed population model and concluded that a quota of 200–250 tons would allow for population growth, resulting in a quota of 250 tons being adopted for the period of 2002–2007. The mating grounds off Newfoundland were also closed to shark fishing. In 2004, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada listed the porbeagle as endangered, largely on the basis of the low population abundance (&lt;25% of original numbers). Canada decided not to list the species under its Species At Risk Act, but further reduced the total fishing quota to 185 tons. In US waters, the 1993 Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean sets an annual quota of 92 tons (after processing) for the porbeagle. In 2006, this species was listed as a species of concern by the NMFS, meaning that it merits conservation concern, but data are insufficient for inclusion on the US Endangered Species Act.

<doc id="1087443" wikidata="Q1170907" url="?curid=1087443" title="The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)">
<text>The Mark of Zorro is a 1920 American silent Western romance film starring Douglas Fairbanks and Noah Beery. This genre-defining swashbuckler adventure was the first movie version of &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;. Based on the 1919 story &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot; by Johnston McCulley, which introduced the masked hero, Zorro, the screenplay was adapted by Fairbanks (as &quot;Elton Thomas&quot;) and Eugene Miller.

The film was produced by Fairbanks for his own production company, Douglas Fairbanks Pictures Corporation, and was the first film released through United Artists, the company formed by Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, and D. W. Griffith.

Noah Beery Jr. makes his first of many dozens of screen appearances, portraying a young child. His father began sporadically billing himself as Noah Beery Sr. as a result.

The film has been remade twice, once in 1940 (starring Tyrone Power) and again in 1974 (starring Frank Langella). In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

&quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; tells the story of Don Diego Vega, the outwardly foppish son of wealthy ranchero Don Alejandro Vega in the old Spanish California of the early 19th century.

Seeing the mistreatment of common citizens by rich landowners and the oppressive colonial government, Don Diego dons the mask of the Robin Hood-like rogue Señor Zorro (&quot;Mr. Fox&quot;), champion of the people, who appears out of nowhere to protect them from the corrupt administration of Governor Alvarado and his henchmen, the villainous Captain Juan Ramon and the brutish Sergeant Pedro Gonzales (Noah Beery, Wallace Beery&#x27;s older half-brother). With his swift swordplay and an athletic sense of humor, Zorro scars the faces of evildoers with his mark, &quot;Z&quot;.

When not in the disguise of Zorro, Don Diego courts the beautiful Lolita Pulido with bad magic tricks and worse manners, though she cannot stand him. Lolita is also courted by Captain Ramon; and by the dashing Zorro, whom she likes.

In the end, when Lolita&#x27;s family is jailed and impoverished by the machinations of Governor Alvarado, Don Diego throws off his masquerade, wins over the soldiers to his side, forces the wicked governor to abdicate, and wins the hand of Lolita, who is delighted to discover that her effeminate suitor, Diego, is actually the dashing hero.

==Primary cast==

* Douglas Fairbanks as Don Diego Vega/Señor Zorro
* Marguerite De La Motte as Lolita Pulido
* Noah Beery Sr. as Sergeant Pedro Gonzales
* Charles Hill Mailes as Don Carlos Pulido
* Claire McDowell as Doña Catalina Pulido
* Robert McKim as Captain Juan Ramon
* George Periolat as Governor Alvarado

* Sidney De Gray as Don Alejandro Vega
* Tote Du Crow as Bernardo, Don Diego&#x27;s mute servant
* Noah Beery Jr. as Boy
* Charles Stevens as Peon beaten by Sergeant Gonzales
* Milton Berle (uncredited child)

==Reception and impact==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; gave &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; a mixed review.

Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance, assessing the film&#x27;s legacy in 2008, writes: &quot;&quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; is a landmark, not only in the career of Douglas Fairbanks, but also in the development of the action-adventure film. With this, his thirtieth motion picture, Fairbanks was transitioning from comedies to the costume films for which he is best remembered. Instead of reflecting the times, &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; offers an infusion of the romantic past with a contemporary flair ... Beyond reenergizing his career and redefining a genre, Fairbanks&#x27;s The Mark of Zorro helped popularize one of the enduring creations of twentieth-century American fiction, a character who was the prototype for comic book heroes such as Batman; In fact, The Mark of Zorro is the canonical movie that the Waynes watched before being murdered.&quot;

&quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2012.

<doc id="1087447" wikidata="Q7926188" url="?curid=1087447" title="Victor and Nikki Newman">
<text>Victor and Nikki Newman are fictional characters and a supercouple from the American CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Victor is portrayed by Eric Braeden and Nikki is portrayed by Melody Thomas Scott. Together, they have shared three marriages and two children; Victoria and Nicholas Newman (Amelia Heinle and Joshua Morrow). The couple is often referred to by the portmanteau &quot;Niktor&quot; by fans on internet message boards and in magazines. Nikki was originally from the lower walks of life, having been a prostitute and stripper. After multiple failed relationships, she began a romance with Victor, who taught her about society. Nikki gave birth to Victoria in 1982, and the pair were married in 1984. Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson, Brenda Epperson) then came between Victor and Nikki, causing them to divorce and each of them remarrying to Ashley and Victor&#x27;s nemesis, Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), respectively. However, the pair continued to be linked to one another, with an affair between the two resulting in second child Nicholas.

The soap opera&#x27;s writers originally detailed Victor and Nikki to marry and divorce or depart from each other in some form or fashion or continuous cycle, a take on the original supercouple formula. Their pairing, regarded as an &quot;inspired decision&quot;, led to Victor and Nikki becoming the most successful supercouple on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Despite Victor marrying architect Diane Jenkins (Alex Donnelley) in 1997, Nikki suffered a gunshot wound the following year and came close to death, resulting in Victor supposedly divorcing Diane and remarrying Nikki on her deathbed. However, Victor and Diane&#x27;s divorce was never legal, invalidating the pair&#x27;s remarriage. An actual divorce between Victor and Diane took place, resulting in the reunion of Victor and Nikki. In September 2002, they remarried again at the site of their first wedding, which would last six years. In 2008, Nikki began an affair with the devious David Chow (Vincent Irizarry), resulting in the pair&#x27;s second divorce. Scott has stated that she thinks the couple always has to get back together, but &quot;not without a challenge&quot;. In March 2013, after four years of an on-and-off relationship, Victor and Nikki remarried for the third time, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

Victor and Nikki are recognized as one of daytime television&#x27;s most prominent pairings, as well as receiving a positive response from critics throughout the years. Scott has also stated that she believes the pair &quot;will always be a huge dynamic&quot;. Braeden has stated that he thought Victor and Nikki&#x27;s storyline was an &quot;honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki&quot;. &quot;The News &amp; Advance&quot; cited Victor and Nikki with other romances considered &quot;epic&quot; of the early supercouple era.

==Development==

Nikki was originally from the lower walks of life, having been a stripper. After multiple failed relationships, she began a romance with Victor, who taught her about society. They fell in love and had a baby, Victoria Newman (Heather Tom), and later a son Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). The couple are widely considered a supercouple within the realm of soap operas. The writers of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; detailed characters Victor Newman and Nikki Reed to marry and divorce or depart from each other in some form or fashion in a continuous cycle. This has taken place for as long as the couple has been together, a take on the original supercouple formula. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; relayed the beginning of the pairing&#x27;s creation and their impact. The &quot;inspired decision&quot; led to Victor and Nikki becoming the series&#x27; most successful supercouple. In an interview with &quot;Dose&quot; magazine, Melody Thomas Scott said that the couple always has to get back together, but not without a challenge. She stated:
The characters had their first wedding on the episode that aired on April 13, 1984.

==Storylines==

===1981–2000===
Victor Newman met Nikki Reed, who, barely out of her teens, was working as a stripper at the Bayou. Victor was intrigued by her and took her home, where under his influence, she was transformed into a classy young lady. Victor is adamant at first that he has no romantic feelings for Nikki, but he soon succumbed to her charms and they had a night of passionate love-making. Victor cast this off as a mistake, and instead took up with a woman named Lorie Brooks, who in truth only wanted to be with Victor to write an exposé on him. Victor later admitted that he truly is in love with Nikki, and she eventually gives birth to a daughter, Victoria Newman, and the couple was married in a lavish ceremony two years later.
One of the greatest threats to Victor and Nikki&#x27;s union is arguably Ashley Abbott, as some time later, Victor fell in love with her, who happens to be the sister of his archenemy Jack Abbott. Victor was heartbroken in discovering that Ashley had aborted his baby so that he would stay with a dying Nikki. Nikki later recovered, but intentionally hadn&#x27;t informed Victor to stay clear of the threat Ashley posed. Yet, they share one final night of passion together, which resulted in the birth of Nicholas Newman. Victor and Nikki ended up divorcing after he lashed out at her for purposely providing information about Ashley&#x27;s abortion to an unauthorized biographer — Leanna Love. Victor marries her, all while being unaware of her true intentions. The marriage is quickly annulled and Victor pays Leanna a settlement, but she remains a bothersome component in Victor&#x27;s life on occasion. Victor then married Ashley by 1990, but the marriage ended after three years due to extreme marital problems. Nikki married Jack, which ended after four years when Victor told Jack he would give him Jabot Cosmetics if he divorced Nikki.

After Victor was blasted by Nikki, Ashley and teenaged Victoria, all resenting the control he tried to exert in their lives, he left town, and during his trip, he is robbed of his wallet, jewelry, and car. After his car is found with a body inside burned beyond recognition, word reaches Genoa City that Victor is dead. However, Victor turned up at the Kansas farm of the blind Hope Wilson just in time to rescue her from a rapist. After Victor lived with Hope, they grew close, and they returned to Genoa City and married. Afterward, Hope gave birth to a son, Victor Adam Newman, Jr., and shortly after she left Victor. Victor hoped to return to Nikki, but she was engaged to Brad Carlton. After Victor was shot by Mari Jo Mason, Nikki returned to his side until he decided to visit Hope again. By 1997, Victor married architect Diane Jenkins, Jack&#x27;s ex-fiancée, but when Nikki was shot by her husband&#x27;s ex-wife Veronica Landers, Victor left Diane to remarry Nikki on her deathbed, and eventually Nikki survived. They realized they wanted to be together, and thus led Victor to divorce Diane, although with his speedy marriage to Nikki, the divorce wasn&#x27;t legal. Eventually, Diane reluctantly agreed to a legal divorce after she acquired millions in the divorce settlement in a very lengthy divorce. Yet, by that time Victor and Nikki had gone their separate ways again.

===2002–2011===
Two years later, Victor and Nikki remarried legally at the site of their first wedding. Nikki and Victor again started up the rocky aspect of their romance when Victor&#x27;s unethical and illegal business practices harm Jabot, as Nikki had made a notable investment there. Nikki started to have horrible flashbacks of accidentally shooting Joshua Cassen when she was five years old, and she was stunned to discover that Joshua was the older brother of her new business associate Bobby Marsino, with whom she has a brief romance. Victor came to Nikki&#x27;s rescue after Bobby&#x27;s mob associates kidnapped her. Nikki moved on, and she and Victor partnered with Phyllis Summers to create a chain of Wellness Spas across the country. However, when Victor learns that Nick, married to Sharon Newman, had an affair with Phyllis, Victor fires her and returned to holding the reins of his company.

When Victor suffers a head injury while rescuing Nikki from a carjacking, Victor becomes epileptic. His loved ones were well off at the seemingly new laid-back personality Victor now encompasses, but they soon became worried for his health when he began experiencing seizures. Making things even more complicated, as well as bizarre, he suddenly developed a friendly relationship with his main enemy Jack. Nikki later became concerned that Jack was manipulating a vulnerable Victor for his own personal financial gain. After a while, Victor finally appeared in good health. Victor and Nikki had their ups and downs, but typically manage to find their way back to each other romantically through various situations. Victor&#x27;s son Victor, Jr. returned to town, now going by Adam Newman. However, they divorce again, and Victor married Victoria&#x27;s friend Sabrina Costelana, and Nikki married David Chow. The following year, Victor remarried Ashley, but Nikki and Victor reunited after he was shot by Patty Williams and given a heart transplant. They went to Europe, and Victor and Ashley divorced.

Victor returned from Belgium with Nikki on his arm. Victor declared himself as head of Newman Enterprises, and Victor and Nikki move back into their Ranch house, and helped discover and return their kidnapped infant granddaughter Faith Newman back to her parents Nick and Sharon. Adam ends up being found &quot;dead&quot;, and Victoria and Nick were arrested. In order to protect his children, Victor takes the blame saying he did it for everything Adam did to his family. Victor is later released and Nick is the main suspect. However, there was a growing amount of proof to suggest that Adam killed Richard Hightower to fake his own death. In order to protect Nick, Victor went to Canada trying to find Adam. There he befriended Meggie McClaine and he ended up nearly being killed. Back at the Newman Ranch, Victor tries to rebuild his relationship with Nikki, but she felt that Meggie was in the way. Victor claimed that he was trying to protect her and she became Nikki&#x27;s personal assistant. In reality, she put together a scheme to get Nikki drinking again, therefore opening up the way for her to marry Victor. Once she marries him, she would kill him and get his money. Meggie eventually recruits Deacon Sharpe to help spike Nikki&#x27;s drinks. Eventually, Deacon and Meggie set up Victor and Nikki to look like Nikki and Deacon were having an affair. Once Victor caught them, he sent Nikki to rehab, where Deacon soon ends up to continue scheming with Meggie. In rehab, he tried to actually help Nikki, and their relationship did turn romantic, especially when Meggie was able to elope with Victor. Meggie posted their wedding photo online and Nikki saw it, giving into romance with Deacon. Meggie fully revealed herself as a manipulative gold-digger targeting the Newman fortune as a widow after she mortally eliminates him. After apparently many spiked drinks, Victor appeared to suffer a heart attack, but stunningly unveiled his sobriety and caught her in a sting operation set up by him, Patrick Murphy, and the cops though Nikki didn&#x27;t know. Meggie was arrested and Victor went to fill in Nikki, but before he did found her in bed with Deacon, blemishing the chances of another marriage. Victor explained that Meggie caused her alcoholic craving by spiking all her drinks to rid her from the ranch and get to him and his money.

===2011–present===
Nikki continued her romance with Deacon, while Victor ended up remarrying Diane Jenkins. Nikki broke up with Deacon after his role in Meggie&#x27;s scheme came to light, and Victor and Nikki eventually had an affair, but their reunion was short lived. Eventually, Victor sent Nikki back to rehab as her alcoholism issues had resurfaced. After a quick annulment from Victor, Diane posted pictures of him and Nikki in bed online. She was murdered months later. After Nikki returned—having escaped from rehab—memories of Diane&#x27;s murder caught up with her. She then confessed to being the killer to Victor, who admitted to killing his ex-wife to protect Nikki.

Victor was jailed, and later married Sharon to keep Nikki away from him, though the marriage ended days later. Deacon blackmailed Nikki into marrying him, using fake information about Diane&#x27;s murder. Nikki agreed, however this marriage was short lived. When Victor was released from jail, the two reunited again.

Victor brought Chelsea Lawson and her mother to town to ruin Victoria&#x27;s marriage to Billy Abbott. When Nikki learned of this, she left him. Victor then pursued a genuine relationship with Sharon, much to everyone&#x27;s dismay. Nikki moved on from Victor when she reunited with Jack after eighteen years apart, and ended up marrying him. Hours after this marriage, Victor eloped with Sharon, despite showing up at the wedding and unsuccessfully telling Nikki not to go through with it.

Yet soon after Victor disappeared and ended up in Los Angeles in amnesia. Sharon set out to get revenge by taking over Newman, while Nikki left Jack to try to find Victor. As a result of an explosion, it was believed that Victor died and the family was shocked. Yet, Victor actually survived.

Nikki and Victor reunited, while they set out to destroy Sharon and Tucker McCall who wanted to keep Victor away so he could take over Newman.

==Reception and impact==
Victor and Nikki are recognized as one of daytime&#x27;s most prominent couples. The couple has received positive reviews from critics throughout the years, &quot;The News &amp; Advance&quot; cited Victor and Nikki with other romances considered &quot;epic&quot; of the early supercouple era. They have garnered a large fan following, being commonly referred to as &quot;Niktor&quot; on internet message boards. In addition, the couple&#x27;s weddings have been reported by mainstream media. Melody Thomas Scott has said, &quot;Let’s face facts: Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, they’ve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years! Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold.&quot; Eric Braeden has said, &quot;I love working with Melody [as well]. I always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki.&quot; Former &quot;As the World Turns&quot; actress Martha Byrne has said, &quot;&quot;Young and Restless&quot;&#x27; Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [the writers] do it really well because they&#x27;re so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them.&quot; Daytime expert Michael Fairman stated: &quot;Victor and Nikki just can’t, we mean can’t, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship.&quot;

<doc id="1087455" wikidata="Q2443962" url="?curid=1087455" title="Littlebredy">
<text>Littlebredy (also written Little Bredy, pronounced ) is a small village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset, situated approximately west of the county town Dorchester. It is sited at the head of the valley of the small River Bride, surrounded by wooded chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. The parish contains the Valley of Stones National Nature Reserve and is in an area rich with evidence of early human occupation. In the 2011 census it had a population of 121.

==History==
The area around Littlebredy is rich with evidence of early human occupation, including stone circles, strip lynchets, tumuli (long and round barrows) and a probable hill fort. North and east of the village the density of barrows is as great as the area around Stonehenge. One mile north of the village and just outside the parish is a group of 44 Bronze Age round barrows of various sizes, known as Winterbourne Poor Lot Barrows or just Poor Lot. On a hill immediately south of the village are the earthworks of Old Warren (or Danes&#x27; Camp), which most likely was a univallate (single rampart) Iron Age hill fort. Old Warren may later have been used as a burh in the time of Alfred the Great, though it may have been not completed, or abandoned in favour of a site at what is now Bridport.

Records from the 10th century refer to the area as &#x27;Bridian&#x27; or &#x27;Brydian&#x27; and in 1086 Littlebredy specifically was recorded in the Domesday Book as &#x27;Litelbride&#x27;. The words &#x27;Bride&#x27; and &#x27;Bredy&#x27; derive from the Celtic for a torrential, gushing stream; the addition of &#x27;Little&#x27; distinguishes the parish from the larger neighbouring parish of Long Bredy.

Littlebredy was owned by Cerne Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, when the Abbey sold its land to Philip Vanwilder. The estate subsequently passed to the Freke family of Iwerne Courtney and then Sir Robert Meller (or Mellor) of Winterborne Came, who built Bridehead House in the early 17th century. In 1730 the estate was bought by the Meech family who in 1797 sold it to wealthy banker Robert Williams from Hertfordshire.

During the 19th century the Williams family—headed by four successive Roberts who all became members of parliament—made substantial changes to the estate. The architects Peter Frederick Robinson and then Benjamin Ferrey were employed. Bridehead House was extended and altered by Robinson in 1830–33, then extended further by Ferrey a few years later. The River Bride was dammed near its source to create a lake as part of landscaping around the house. Ferrey also designed new cottages to form an estate village and provided plans for restoring the parish church, including adding a spire to its 14th-century tower. Some Jacobean buildings in the village were also changed around this time, being reworked into a Gothic farmyard or stable block. Ferrey&#x27;s plan for the church—which involved virtually rebuilding it—was implemented in 1847 under the supervision of the third Robert Williams&#x27; brother-in-law, Arthur Acland, who also had an architectural input.

In the churchyard is a memorial to Frederic Wallis, Bishop of Wellington, New Zealand, who married into the Williams family. It is made from the wood of a tree sent specially from New Zealand.
==Government==
For elections to the British House of Commons, Littlebredy is in the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

At the upper tier of local government, Littlebredy is the Dorset unitary authority area. For elections to Dorset Council, it is in the Chesil Bank electoral ward.

At the lower tier, Littlebredy is a civil parish. It does not have a parish council, but it does have parish meetings.

==Geography==
Littlebredy village is sited between 85 and 110 metres above sea-level at the head of the small River Bride, surrounded by wooded chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. It is west of the county town Dorchester, east of Bridport, northwest of Weymouth and north of the English Channel. The nearest railway stations are Maiden Newton, Dorchester West, Dorchester South, Upwey and Weymouth, which are all within a direct radius of . The nearest main road is the A35 trunk road approximately to the north. All of Littlebredy parish lies within the Dorset National Landscape area.
===Valley of Stones===
In the south of the parish is the Valley of Stones, which in 1906 was described by Sir Frederick Treves as &quot;a mysterious glen among the downs, on whose grassy slopes many huge stones are scattered.&quot; In prehistoric times it was used as a source of building material for nearby constructions such as tombs and stone circles, and within 4 miles are two-thirds of all such structures in the county. Folklore attributes the origin of the stones to have been two giants playing stone-throwing games, but they are the result of conditions at the end of the last ice age, when freezing and thawing caused sandstone on surrounding hilltops to break up and slump downhill. They form one of the best British examples of a sarsen stone boulder train. The stones and the surrounding dry chalk valley provide habitats for a variety of flora and fauna—including clustered bellflower, autumn gentian, lichens, bryophytes and the adonis blue butterfly—and the area is designated a National Nature Reserve.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Littlebredy civil parish had 53 dwellings, 45 households and a population of 121.

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2001 is shown in the table below:

In the 1861 census the parish had 41 inhabited dwellings and a population of 199.

==Notable people==
* Robert Meller (c.1564-1624), member of parliament
* Ben Pentreath (born 1971), architect and interior designer

<doc id="1087460" wikidata="Q1539782" url="?curid=1087460" title="Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod">
<text>The Lockheed Martin Sniper is a targeting pod for military aircraft that provides positive target identification, autonomous tracking, GPS coordinate generation, and precise weapons guidance from extended standoff ranges.

The system has been designated AN/AAQ-33 in U.S. military service as the &quot;Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP)&quot;. Further variants are the &quot;Sniper Extended Range (XR)&quot;, as well as the &quot;PANTERA&quot; export derivative of the Sniper XR. The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is built with the equivalent of the Sniper XR in its onboard sensors called the AN/AAQ-40 &quot;Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS)&quot;. The most modern version is the &quot;Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE)&quot;.

==Design==
The Sniper is a single, lightweight targeting pod with much lower aerodynamic drag than the systems it replaces . Its image processing allows aircrews to detect, identify and engage tactical-size targets outside the range of most enemy air defenses, giving it a crucial role in the destruction of enemy air defense missions. It also supports urban engagements beyond jet noise range for counter-insurgency operations. It offers a 3-5X increase in detection range over the older LANTIRN system , and is currently flying on U.S. Air Force and multinational F-16, F-15, B-1B, CF-18, Harrier, A-10, B-52 and Tornado aircraft.

The pod incorporates a high definition mid-wave FLIR, dual-mode laser, visible-light HDTV, laser spot tracker, laser marker, video data link, and a digital data recorder. Advanced sensors and image processing incorporating image stabilization enable targets to be identified at ranges which minimize exposure to defensive enemy systems. The dual-mode laser offers an eye-safe mode for urban combat and training operations along with a laser-guided bomb designation laser.

The pod&#x27;s FLIR allows observation and tracking through smoke and clouds, and in low light / no light conditions. The CCD camera supports the same operations in visible light for most daylight conditions. 

For target coordination with ground and air forces, a laser spot tracker, a laser marker, and an HDTV quality video down-link to ground-based controllers supports rapid target detection and identification. The Sniper can also provide high-resolution imagery for non-traditional Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (NTISR) missions without occupying the centerline station on small fighter aircraft, and can maintain surveillance even when the aircraft maneuvers. As a result, a second, dedicated fighter aircraft isn&#x27;t needed to provide protection to a dedicated ISR aircraft, which many small nations cannot afford.

For ease of maintenance, Sniper&#x27;s optical bed design, partitioning, and diagnostic capabilities permit two-level maintenance, eliminating costly intermediate-level support. Automated built-in testing allows maintenance personnel to isolate and replace a line replaceable unit in under 20 minutes to restore full mission-capable status.

==In use==
In August 2001, the U.S. Air Force announced Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Sniper as the winner of the Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) competition. The contract provides for pods and associated equipment, spares and support of the F-16 and F-15E aircraft for the entire force, active-duty Air Force and Air National Guard. The U.S. Air Force initial seven-year contract for Sniper ATP has potential value in excess of $843 million. The Sniper ATP has delivered over 125 pods and the U.S. Air Force plans to procure at least 522 Sniper ATPs. The follow-on Advanced Targeting Pod - Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) contract was split between the Lockheed Martin Sniper and the LITENING.

In 2014, the USAF declared initial operational capability for the Sniper ATP-SE which included sensor and networking improvements.

The Sniper is used on the U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress, B-1B Lancer, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and A-10 Thunderbolt II. It was also used on the British Harrier GR9 and the Canadian CF-18 Hornet. In 2016 Lockheed Martin announced that Kuwait would be the first country to use Sniper on the Eurofighter Typhoon. A team of Lockheed Martin UK, BAE Systems and Leonardo S.p.A. (Selex S&amp;AS at the time) has successfully demonstrated and flown a Sniper ATP on board a Tornado GR4 combat aircraft.

The Sniper came under fire in 2014 in the aftermath of a deadly airstrike in Afghanistan that saw five American and one Afghan soldier killed when a B-1B bomber equipped with the pod could not detect the infrared strobe lights on the helmets of U.S. troops in a firefight, resulting in the deadliest case of friendly fire between American forces in the course of the Afghanistan War. 

On 27 March 2015, Lockheed Martin was awarded a sole-source contract by the US DOD worth $485 million firm fixed price with minimal cost-plus-fixed-fee, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity to provide multiple Sniper advanced targeting pods to the USAF.

In 2024, the Ministry of National Defense released footage confirming that the F16V fighter of the Republic of China Air Force used the pod to calibrate the J-16D and H-6K invading ADIZ.

<text>Litton Cheney is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in south-west England. It lies west of the county town Dorchester. It is sited beneath chalk hills in the valley of the small River Bride. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 359.

On Pins Knoll, to the west of the village, was once an Iron Age settlement, excavated in 1959. On the same site, in the 4th century, there was also a Romano-British building.

The parish church of St Mary was substantially restored in 1878, though it retains features—notably the tower, chancel arch and parts of the nave and porch—from the 14th and 15th centuries and has a font bowl which is probably Norman; the site originated at this time or earlier.

From 1953 until 1979, The Old Rectory was the home of noted English engraver, designer, typographer and painter Reynolds Stone.

Litton Cheney has a small primary school &#x27;Thorner&#x27;s Church of England VA Primary School&#x27;. The school has a &#x27;Good&#x27; OFSTED rating. 

==Prehistoric monuments==
In 1936, the archaeologists Stuart Piggott, Cecily Piggott, and W. E. V. Young came upon what they suggested was a ruined Bronze Age stone circle near to the village. This feature consisted of a circular area measuring 47 feet in diameter that was encircled by a shallow ditch. A single sarsen stone was located on the southeast of the ditch, which the Piggotts suggested may have been the last surviving stone in a circle. A further three sarsen stones were located 90 feet to the south of the circle, but their relation to it was deemed &quot;problematic&quot; by the Piggotts.

<text>Magasa is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy in northern Italy.

==Historical and cultural profile==
In position on the plateau of Denai, in the Valley of Vestino, inland of Lake of Garda, rises the small village of Magasa, whose origins go back to the Celtics; they called the place &quot;mag&quot;, the field. The Stoni and the Gallic Cenomani, then the Romans and the Lombards lived here. The Lodrone family established in Magasa from 1200 to 1807; then, for centuries, this has been nobody&#x27;s land. It became part of Italy in 1919, Magasa was separated from Trentino in 1934, and became a hamlet of Turano.

The ancient administrative autonomy of 1589, was achieved again in 1947. The abundance of pastures has always been significant for the village economy. Dedicated to cattle raising which survives still today in summer mountain barns with production of milk, from which famous cheeses and butter are obtained. The historical core is a crossing of small passages with peasants&#x27; high and narrow houses; the church is dedicated to Sant&#x27;Antonio Abate, mid 18th century.

Inside, the religious building is characterized by the floor in red and yellow stones from the Denervo mountain. The pleasant hamlet of Cadria is surrounded by a magic natural atmosphere; the people are proud of their small church of San Lorenzo. The church, of allegedly of Lombards origins, was restored in 1547 and is the pilgrimage arrival on occasion of the patron&#x27;s day, 10 August. An ancient ritual is renewed, instituted by testament in 1588, with the distribution to every participant to the religious celebration of one piece of bread and fifth of wine.

Today, the village of Magasa is the owner of the church and it is morally engaged to comply with the original benefactor&#x27;s desire to renew the tradition. The bright sky of Cima Rest, free from any pollution, has allowed the association Astrofili di Salò to arrange an Astronomical public observatory.

==The haylofts of Cima Rest==
The straw-roofed haylofts of plateau Denai and Cima Rest are mentioned for the first time in a document dated 1613. Some historians have established a link between their constructive type and some low Middle Age constructions; other say that Lombards from Hungary built them in 600 a. D.

Their unique architecture is a true masterpiece of efficiency and economy. The steep roof in wheat straw is waterproof. In order not to lose the memory of the places and local culture, one of the haylofts of Cima Rest has become the Ethnographic Museum of the Valvestino.

<doc id="1087465" wikidata="Q973052" url="?curid=1087465" title="George Steele">
<text>William James Myers (April 16, 1937 – February 16, 2017), better known by his ring name George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele, was an American professional wrestler, school teacher, author, and actor. His career lasted from 1967 until 1988, though he made occasional wrestling appearances into the 1990s and 2000s.

Steele was known around the world as a professional wrestler for the WWE (then known as the WWF) and portrayed Swedish wrestler and actor Tor Johnson in Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Ed Wood.

==Early life==
Myers was born in Detroit on April 16, 1937, and was raised in Madison Heights, Michigan. During high school, he found success in track, baseball, basketball, and football. In 1956, Myers entered Michigan State University as a football player for the Michigan State Spartans, but his career as a football player was immediately cut short as a result of knee problems. In 1961, he was with the Grand Rapids Blazers (UFL).

After earning a Bachelor of Science degree from Michigan State University and a master&#x27;s degree from Central Michigan University, Myers became a teacher, amateur wrestling coach, and football coach at Madison High School in Madison Heights, Michigan. There he would eventually become a member of the Michigan Coaches Hall of Fame.

==Professional wrestling career==

Looking to supplement his income, he got into the world of Detroit-area professional wrestling, but in order to protect his privacy, he wrestled using a mask and the name &quot;the Student&quot;. Gary Hart served as the Student&#x27;s manager and had to explain to the announcers why his client could not apply any legitimate holds or maneuvers instead relying on only his undisciplined brute strength. Myers was soon scouted by World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) champion Bruno Sammartino and began working in Pittsburgh in 1967 on the popular &quot;Studio Wrestling&quot; TV show broadcast on WIIC-TV (later WPXI-TV) Channel 11. Sammartino had liked the character Myers developed of a wild man with incredible strength. However, he had him drop the mask, as well as the title of the Student. Looking to hide his real name, Myers opted for the alias &quot;George Steele&quot;. According to Michigan High School Hall of Fame coach George Steele of Warren, he and Myers were coaching against each other in a high school JV match-up while both were early into their careers. At halftime, Myers approached Steele and told him about his venture into wrestling and that he was looking for a name. Myers allegedly asked Steele if he could use his name, that he liked it a lot and the future Hall of Fame coach told him no problem. Steele states in an interview available on YouTube that he was in Pittsburgh when he was looking for a stage name. Local wrestler &quot;Jumpin&#x27;&quot; John DeFazio suggested Jim Steele since he was in the &quot;Steel City&quot;. He did not like the first name Jim and he suggested George which is what he eventually went with.

Working well with Sammartino, he was invited for a full run in the WWWF. He told WWWF TV commentator Ray Morgan that he was the nephew of Ray Steele (kayfabe) and had an extensive amateur background. He sold the story by using an array of armlocks on opponents, weakening them for his finisher, the flying hammerlock (Steele would lift his opponents off the mat by a hammerlocked arm). He also revealed his teaching background to interviewers that made his in-ring Neanderthal image all the more incongruous. He wrestled Sammartino to an hour-long draw at Madison Square Garden but lost the rematch. In Boston, being set up to face Sammartino for a long series in that city, he got one of the few clean wins over Victor Rivera, a top babyface, with the flying hammerlock submission, at a huge Fenway Park outdoor show. He was then relegated to a feud with Chief Jay Strongbow, and lost to Edouard Carpentier at the Garden before taking a brief hiatus to reinvent his wildman character.
Steele became a true crazy heel, acting like a wild man in the ring, tearing up the turnbuckle with his teeth and using the stuffing as a weapon as well as sticking out his green tongue (an effect accomplished by eating green Clorets breath mints). The Animal had a stooped posture and a hairless head, but a thick mat of fur on his back; wrestling broadcasters often speculated that The Animal was indeed &quot;the missing link&quot;. At best, The Animal could occasionally manage to utter a word or two during interviews with one of them usually being &quot;Duh-da-dahh&quot; or &quot;You! You go!&quot;

As Steele recalled in a later shoot interview, his infamous &quot;Duh-dahh&quot; interview style happened by accident. Throughout his career, Steele prided himself on being able to cut eloquent and effective promos and ranked his mic skills with the best in the business. At a WWF TV taping in the early 1980s, he was cutting one of these promos when Vince McMahon cut him off and reminded Steele that his gimmick was the &quot;Animal&quot;, and for an animal, he was &quot;making too much sense&quot;. Incensed, Steele did a second take of nothing but garbled and incoherent syllables (&quot;Duhh-dahh&quot;). Steele did this deliberately and out of pure frustration, thinking that McMahon would acquiesce and allow Steele to cut his normal, eloquent promos. Much to Steele&#x27;s shock, McMahon replied, &quot;That&#x27;s exactly what I want!&quot;, and this would remain Steele&#x27;s interview style for the rest of his WWF run. Steele started to fully cultivate his gimmick of a menacing imbecile.
Steele eventually became one of the more popular and recognizable wrestlers during most of the 1980s professional wrestling boom. He turned face during &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event I&quot; when his partners in a six-man match, Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik, abandoned him to their opponents, Ricky Steamboat and the U.S. Express (Barry Windham and Mike Rotunda), leading to Steele being taken under the wing of the Express&#x27; manager, Capt. Lou Albano, who consoled him following the loss. His most famous feud was in 1986 against &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, after Steele developed a crush on Savage&#x27;s valet, Miss Elizabeth. The feud was meant to last only a couple of months (and end with Steele being disappointed), but it proved so popular with fans that it continued well into 1987. Steele later laughingly recalled Savage&#x27;s jealousy regarding Elizabeth, his real-life girlfriend, and said he assured Savage that he had a daughter older than Elizabeth and that his infatuation was just for the show. Steele would later say that Savage was the most &quot;jealous man&quot; he ever met. During Savage&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship match against Steamboat at WrestleMania III, Steele—who was in Steamboat&#x27;s corner—twice interfered in the match. First, he took the ring bell from Savage as he attempted to use it off of the top rope. Secondly, after Savage kicked him and took the bell back, Steele shoved Savage off of the top rope, allowing Steamboat to roll up Savage for the pin to win the championship.

In 1988, Steele began carrying a stuffed animal named &quot;Mine&quot; to the ring. He participated in the Wrestlemania IV Battle Royal but was outside of the ring the whole time. According to Steele, he suffered a knee injury at a house show prior to the event, which was the reason he didn&#x27;t get in the ring. Late in 1988, Steele retired after being diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease. Steele then became a road agent for the WWF until he was released in October 1990 due to budget cuts. Soon after, however, Steele was re-hired by the WWF and continued to work as an agent until the late 1990s. Though he left the WWF without any WWF championships behind him, Steele grew to become one of the most recognized and popular figures in WWF history and was inducted into the WWF Hall Of Fame class of 1995.
He returned to wrestling in 1997 working in the independent circuit. Later that year on December 29, he teamed with Taka Michinoku on Monday Night Raw losing to Taka&#x27; rival Brian Christopher and Jerry Lawler by disqualification . In 1998, during the WWF&#x27;s &quot;Attitude Era&quot;, Steele returned as part of The Oddities until leaving in 1999. He lost to Greg Valentine at Heroes of Wrestling on October 10, 1999. Then on January 10, 2000, he appeared on an episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; as one of three legends Jeff Jarrett had to face that night. He continued wrestling in the indies until his final match defeating Angel Armoni at All American Wrestling in Eau Claire, Wisconsin on July 29, 2001.

Eight years later, Steele made an appearance at TNA Wrestling&#x27;s 2008 Slammiversary pay-per-view event as a groomsman in the wedding for &quot;Black Machismo&quot; Jay Lethal and SoCal Val, along with Koko B. Ware, Kamala, and Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts.

Steele made a surprise appearance on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; on November 15, 2010, during a match between Kofi Kingston and David Otunga.

==Acting career==
In 1994, Steele made his professional acting debut as Swedish wrestler-turned-actor Tor Johnson in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Ed Wood&quot;. Coincidentally, Steele was often mistaken for Johnson earlier in his career. According to Steele, a New York novelty shop once sold a Tor Johnson mask as a George Steele mask to increase sales, due to Steele&#x27;s popularity at the time.

In 2008, Steele co-starred with Greg Valentine in a short film entitled &quot;Somethin Fishy&quot;, in which the two former wrestlers purchase a fishing camp. The film served as the pilot for a comedy series that was not developed further.

Steele also appeared in a Minolta commercial with actor Tony Randall.

==Personal life and death==

Myers had dyslexia and in 1988 was diagnosed with Crohn&#x27;s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that currently has no cure, but can be brought into remission. In 1998, doctors told Myers that his Crohn&#x27;s Disease had gone into remission and that he no longer suffered from any of the disease&#x27;s symptoms. In 2002, to prevent the symptoms from returning, Myers had his colon removed.

Myers was a devout Christian. He attended the First Baptist Church Merritt Island and lived in Cocoa Beach, Florida, with his wife Pat, whom he married before he entered Michigan State in 1956. Together, Pat and Jim had a daughter, Felicia, followed by two sons, Dennis and Randy.

On February 16, 2017, Myers died in hospice care due to kidney failure, at the age of 79.

==Other media==
Steele has four appearances in WWE video games, those being &quot;WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain&quot;, WWE Champions, &quot;WWE SuperCard&quot;, and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot;, in all four games he appears as a legend character. He is also featured in all three games in the &quot;Legends of Wrestling&quot; series.

His book, &quot;Animal&quot;, was released on June 1, 2013.

A song about Steele titled &quot;George Steele&quot; appears on the album &quot;Charmed Life&quot; by punk rock band Half Japanese.

<doc id="1087474" wikidata="Q4135593" url="?curid=1087474" title="Creative geography">
<text>Creative geography, or artificial landscape, is a film editing technique invented by the early Russian filmmaker Lev Kuleshov sometime around the 1920s. It is a subset of montage, in which multiple segments shot at various locations and/or times are edited together such that they appear to all occur in a continuous place at a continuous time. Creative geography is used constantly in film and television, for instance when a character walks through the front door of a house shown from the outside, to emerge into a sound stage of the house&#x27;s interior.

It was during the filming of his film &quot;The Project of the Prait Engineer&quot;, that Lev Kuleshov, pioneer of the assembly as the main pillar of a movie, began to investigate and experiment. The assembly was an unexplored field and devoted part of his career as a director to develop theoretically various articles around it. He accidentally discovered the technique that is being described: the creative geography. He lacked plans for the characters in the film watching electric poles, and to solve the problem, he decided to shoot on the one hand, the characters, looking out of the field, and on the other hand, the poles. The characters were not in the same location of the posts, in fact, they were recorded in different areas of Moscow. However, the assembly achieved the effect of creative geography, that is, it seemed that they were in the same place.

A notable and innovative example of creative geography is the TARDIS time machine on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which looks like a police call box on the outside but is much larger on the inside. The viewer knows that the actors are stepping into a prop and then filming at a sound stage that represents the interior, but, via creative geography and suspension of disbelief, the transition is made seamless.

An extreme example of creative geography occurred in the film &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; in a dialogue scene featuring the characters played by David Bowie and Marlene Dietrich. Bowie and Dietrich actually filmed their respective parts separately, in two different rooms months apart: editing and shot-matching were employed in an attempt to convince the audience that these two people were in the same room at the same time. At one point, Dietrich&#x27;s character gives a memento to Bowie&#x27;s character: to achieve this, she handed the prop to an &quot;extra actor&quot;, who then walked out of frame. In a separate shot, a different &quot;extra actor&quot; (playing the same person) walked into frame and gave the prop to Bowie.

<text>Malegno (Camunian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in Val Camonica, province of Brescia, Lombardy, northern Italy. Malegno lies on the right bank of the river Oglio, and is crossed by the river Lanico.

==History==

Traces of ancient human activities are represented by two statues-stele, founded in the &quot;Bagnolo&quot; area, west of Malegno.

In 1758 the waters of Lanico flooded the area.

By decree of 1928 the town of Malegno was united with that of Cividate Camuno, forming a single commune until 1947.

==Main sights==
* Parish Church of St. Andrew, built between 1706 and 1709.
* former parish of St. Andrew, modified in the 15th, 16th, and 17th century.
* Church of Santa Maria at the Bridge, near the Hospital Vallecamonica. It dates from the 14th century.

==Culture==
The scütüm are, in Camunian dialect, nicknames, sometimes personal, elsewhere showing the characteristic features of a community. The one which characterize the people of Malegno is &quot;Crape de Legn&quot;, &quot;Malignù&quot;, &quot;Getù&quot;.

<doc id="1087476" wikidata="Q7890821" url="?curid=1087476" title="United States Navy Physical Readiness Test">
<text>A Physical Readiness Test, also known as a Physical Fitness Assessment, or PFA, is conducted by the United States Navy to determine the physical fitness of their sailors.

== Standard testing ==
The Physical Fitness Assessment consists of a Body Composition Assessment (BCA) and a Physical Readiness Test (PRT), which includes a timed cardio event consisting of run/treadmill or a swim (or an alternate cardio consisting of 12-minutes on a stationary bike), timed curl-ups, and timed sit-ups.
PFA scores from lowest to highest are fail, probationary, satisfactory, good, excellent, outstanding, and maximum, with prefixes of low, medium, and high providing further granularity per NAVADMIN 061/16.

Scores for the cardio (time or calories), the curl-ups (number completed in two minutes), and the sit-ups (number completed in two minutes) are determined by age, sex, and time (for run and swim) or calories (for stationary bike).

Other branches of the DoD have similar standards.

== 2020 planned changes ==
In 2020, sit-ups were replaced with a plank exercise. Additionally, a rowing machine option was added to the aerobics test.

==Elite units==
Most branches of the US military use modified, enhanced tests of the regular tests of physical stamina and performance as minimum requirements for applicants to special or elite programs. Some of these programs are SEAL, SWCC, Navy Diver, EOD, and other Special Operations Forces. These tests usually include extra components so that running, swimming, and pullups are all assessed in addition to situps, pushups, and the cardiovascular portion. In some cases pushups techniques and swim strokes may be particular to a certain group, including &quot;diver (triceps) pushups&quot;, &quot;combat sidestroke&quot; swim strokes done in full uniform with boots by SEAL and SWCC applicants, and strictly monitored pull-up technique.
Within these communities enhanced tests may be given in place of the regular tests, deriving and reporting the data needed for the minimum requirements of the service and maintaining additional data such as swim and pullup data to meet the requirements of their special program.

==Deaths==
In 2019, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old woman died due to the physical exertions of the physical tests.

<text>Strathspey (, ) is a region of the Scottish Highlands comprising part of the valley of the Spey. It includes the towns of Aviemore, Boat of Garten, Grantown-on-Spey, and Aberlour.

Strathspey, as traditionally defined, stretches from Upper Craigellachie (near Aviemore) to Lower Craigellachie (near the village of the same name). Above it is Badenoch and below it is the low-lying region of Speyside. The region is administratively divided between Moray and the Highland council area.

Speyside is one of the main centres of the Scotch whisky industry, with a high concentration of single malt distilleries in the region, including the Glenfiddich and Balvenie distilleries. Scotland&#x27;s Malt Whisky Trail is a tourism initiative featuring seven working Speyside distilleries, a historic distillery and the Speyside Cooperage. The concept was created in the early 1980s. The region is a natural for whisky distillers because of three benefits: it is close to barley farms, contains the River Spey and is close to the port of Garmouth. The region also hosts the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival.

==Twin towns==
* Grantown-on-Spey, the capital of Strathspey, is twinned with Notre-Dame-de-Monts, Vendée, France 
* Speyside, the area downriver from Grantown-on-Spey, is twinned with Touques, Calvados, France

== Notable residents ==
* John Robert Grant (1729–1790), a Loyalist officer during the American Revolution and refugee settler in Summerville, Nova Scotia.
* Fr. Allan MacDonald (1859-1905), a Roman Catholic priest and highly important figure in modern Scottish Gaelic literature, had family roots in Strathspey.
* Iain Ruadh Stiùbhart (1700–1752), Jacobite Army officer and war poet during the rising of 1745.

<doc id="1087483" wikidata="Q7249455" url="?curid=1087483" title="Projectionless C*-algebra">
<text>In mathematics, a projectionless C*-algebra is a C*-algebra with no nontrivial projections. For a unital C*-algebra, the projections 0 and 1 are trivial. While for a non-unital C*-algebra, only 0 is considered trivial. The problem of whether simple infinite-dimensional C*-algebras with this property exist was posed in 1958 by Irving Kaplansky, and the first example of one was published in 1981 by Bruce Blackadar. For commutative C*-algebras, being projectionless is equivalent to its spectrum being connected. Due to this, being projectionless can be considered as a noncommutative analogue of a connected space.

== Examples ==
* C, the algebra of complex numbers.
* The reduced group C*-algebra of the free group on finitely many generators.
* The Jiang-Su algebra is simple, projectionless, and KK-equivalent to C.

== Dimension drop algebras ==
Let formula_1 be the class consisting of the C*-algebras formula_2 for each formula_3, and let formula_4 be the class of all C*-algebras of the form

formula_5,

where formula_6 are integers, and where formula_7 belong to formula_8.

Every C*-algebra A in formula_4 is projectionless, moreover, its only projection is 0.

<text>Jack Lukeman (born Seán Loughman 11 February 1973), usually simply known as Jack L, is an Irish songwriter, musician, record producer, vocal artist and broadcaster.

==Early life==
Lukeman was born as Seán Loughman in St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Athy; son of Seán Loughman, who was a mechanic, and his wife, Rose. Lukeman grew up in Bennetsbridge, near Athy, County Kildare.

Lukeman attended a youth club in Athy known as Aontas Ogra at the age of 12 years old, where he was involved in artistic ventures as well as playing music there. He left school at 15. After spending a short period in the family business, he began playing music full-time at 18 cutting his teeth on the Bohemian busking scene around Europe in the early 90s. Playing across Holland, Belgium and Germany sometimes playing with art rock band Serious Women with David Constantine and Martin Clancy whom he has continued to collaborate with over the years. His first vocal performance can be heard on Serious Women&#x27;s album 38SCR, called after the art-house in which they all lived and where the album was made.

==Career==
Lukeman first came to prominence in the summer of 1995 when he and The Black Romantics took up a residency at The Da Club (Dublin Arts Club) in Dublin selling out night after night. The band&#x27;s set included interpretations of Jacques Brel along with several of Jack&#x27;s own compositions. The band recorded the album &quot;Wax&quot; in 1995 before splitting in 1997.

Lukeman established himself as a solo artist and songwriter with his live work and his breakthrough 1999 multi-platinum selling album &quot;Metropolis Blue&quot;, gaining record deals and touring extensively in the US and Europe, and becoming a regular fixture on U.S college radio with the singles &quot;Rooftop Lullabye&quot;, &quot;Georgie Boy&quot; and &quot;Ode to Ed Wood&quot;.

John Walshe of &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine stated, &quot;Lukeman&#x27;s voice is powerful and fluid. His range too is impressive, from the deep baritone resonance of &#x27;When The Moon Is High&#x27; to the aching falsetto of the magnificent &#x27;Rooftop Lullaby&#x27; ... this is a timeless collection of fine songs, beautifully delivered, from an artist as unique as Ireland has ever produced&quot;. He released three singles from this album: &quot;Georgie Boy&quot;, &quot;Ode to Ed Wood&quot; and &quot;Rooftop Lullaby&quot;.

&quot;Metropolis Blue&quot; was followed up with 2001&#x27;s album &quot;Universe&quot;. The album was recorded in L.A, Jamaica and Dublin with Greg Wells producing the single &quot;So Far Gone&quot;.

The album was supported in 2002 with a run of theatre shows with theatre director Raymond Keane from Barabbas Theatre Company. It was called &quot;The Little Universe&quot; and combined black box and light theatre with music and earned five star reviews in The Guardian.

2003 saw Lukeman play a 14-week residency of shows in Spirit in Dublin producing the DVD &quot;Chez Jack L&quot;.

2005 saw the release of studio album written and produced by Lukeman, &quot;Broken Songs&quot;, which included the radio hit singles &quot;Open Your Borders&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Get Bitter&quot;, &quot;Chocolate Eyes&quot; and &quot;Authentic Fake&quot;. Lukeman followed up the success of &quot;Broken Songs&quot; in 2006 with a live DVD &quot;MOMENTO&quot;, recorded at the Olympia Theatre.

In 2008, Lukeman released &quot;Burn On&quot;, an album of Randy Newman songs, which had a performance with the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra in NYC&#x27;s South Street Seaport.

In 2010, Lukeman collaborated with writer Anna McPartlin on her new book &quot;So What if I&#x27;m Broken&quot;, in which each chapter was inspired by and named after one of Lukeman&#x27;s songs. The narrative consisted of the relationship between Jack L fans.

Lukeman was awarded the Edinburgh Spotlight Best Music Award at the World biggest and oldest festival, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2010 for his show &quot;A Month of Mondays&quot;.

In May 2011, Lukeman presented a series of radio shows with fellow Irish singer Julie Feeney on Lyric FM called &quot;High Fidelity&quot; tracing the history of recorded song from Edison to the IPOD.

In 2013, Lukeman Released the &quot;Great Wall of China&quot; EP, a song cycle and travelogue. Kicking off The Great Wall of China Tour saw him support Jools Holland&#x27;s UK tour.

In 2016, Lukeman performed at RTÉ&#x27;s Centenary Concert to mark the 100 year anniversary of Ireland&#x27;s 1916 Rising.

During his musical career Lukeman has worked with composer Brian Byrne, the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, the Brooklyn Philharmonic and producers Greg Wells, Craig Armstrong and Martin Clancy.

Lukeman has also performed over the years supporting or alongside U2, Ronnie Wood, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, John Lee Hooker, Elvis Costello, Jools Holland, and Marianne Faithfull, and has appeared at venues such as Olympia Paris, Royal Albert Hall in London, and The Lincoln Center in NYC.

==Personal life==
Lukeman and his partner, Rebecca Mack, have one son, Seán, born in 2024.

<text>Manerba del Garda is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy. It is located at the southwest side of the Lake Garda.

It is bounded by the comunes of San Felice del Benaco, Puegnago sul Garda, Moniga del Garda, Polpenazze del Garda and Soiano del Lago.
Manebra del Garda is divided into the seven hamlets of Solarolo, Montinelle, Balbiana, Pieve, Trevisago, Campagnola and Gardoncino.

==History==
Manerba was founded, according to the legend, in devotion to the goddess Minerva. Other historians trace the name to the Gauls Cenomani, stemming from the union of the terms &quot;mon&quot;, leader, and &quot;erb&quot;, a military zone, identifying Manerba as residence of the chief of the tribe. A charter of Frederick II dating from 1 November 1221 mentions the territory surrounding the ancient Church of Manerba as &quot;Tenense&quot;, whence its current name, Valtenesi.

The presence of man in the Garda area goes back to prehistoric times: in the Manerba area are remains of a Mesolithic village, while under natural terrace located in the foothills of the &quot;Rocca&quot; (castle) are traces of a Neolithic settlement from between 4,500 and 4,000 BC, and an important necropolis dating from the Copper Age.

The Valtenesi saw the construction of several castles starting from the 13th century AD, some of which erected on the ruins of Roman forts. The tower of the castle in the center of Manerba represents the convergence point of a radial pattern that connects the towers of all the municipalities around. This is the oldest castle in the Valtenesi, built in the 12th/13th centuries on the ruins of a medieval fortress and of a settlement dating to the Iron Age, and is firmly anchored on the Manerba cliffs hanging over the southern basin of Lake Garda.

==Main sights==
Manerba is home to several prehistoric pile-dwellings (or stilt house) settlements that are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Manerba houses the Rocca di Manerba del Garda which is characterized by several archaeological sites.

==Municipal government ==
Manerba is headed by a mayor (&#x27;) assisted by a legislative body, the &#x27;, and an executive body, the &#x27;. Since 1995 the mayor and members of the &#x27; are directly elected together by resident citizens, while from 1945 to 1995 the mayor was chosen by the legislative body. The &#x27; is chaired by the mayor, who appoints others members, called &#x27;. The offices of the &#x27; are housed in a building usually called the &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

Since 1995 the mayor of Manerba is directly elected by citizens, originally every four, then every five years. The current mayor is Flaviano Mattiotti (FI), elected on 26 May 2019 with the 53.4% of the votes and re-elected on 10 June 2024 with 74% of the votes.

<doc id="1087492" wikidata="Q2595584" url="?curid=1087492" title="Supporting character">
<text>A supporting character is a character in a narrative that is not the focus of the primary storyline, but is important to the plot/protagonist, and appears or is mentioned in the story enough to be more than just a minor character or a cameo appearance. Supporting characters differ from minor characters because they have complex backstory of their own, desires, and emotions. While this is usually in relation to the main character, rather than entirely independently, developed supporting characters add layers and dimension to the story and the protagonist. These back stories can increase the plot or further develop the main character. Different supporting characters have different roles. Some common types of supporting characters include: love interest, antagonist, best friend, mentor, sidekick, comic relief, and caregiver. Each supporting character has their own role that advances the plot and brings about conflict. Often, supporting characters can cross over into different tropes. Some examples of well-known supporting characters include Watson in the Sherlock Holmes stories, Donkey in the &quot;Shrek&quot; films, and Ron Weasley in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. No matter what type of supporting character, they all help the protagonist achieve their purpose, advance the story, or have personal growth. Supporting characters fit into three broad categories: supporters, antagonists, and informants. 

Supporters include caregivers, love interests, comedic relief, and close friends. They are generally important to the protagonist, so they often become the target or victim to the antagonist. They also characterize the protagonist through dialogue and their relationship. They offer the protagonist aid, companionship, and physical or emotional help. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe are examples of supporters. 

Antagonists are the opposite of the protagonists and act as the conflict of the story. They challenge the protagonist and aid in teaching them a lesson. The Joker is a popular antagonist in the &quot;Batman&quot; series

Informants are characters that help the protagonist on a journey of personal growth or information. They can be mentors, guides, or messengers. They provide wisdom and direction for the protagonist, often at a crossroads in their journey. Yoda in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise is an example of an informant. 

In television, supporting characters may appear in more than half of episodes per season. In some cases, especially in ongoing material such as comic books and television series, supporting characters themselves may become main characters in a spin-off if they gain sufficient approval from their audience.

<doc id="1087493" wikidata="Q1591572" url="?curid=1087493" title="...And Oceans">
<text>...And Oceans, previously known as Havoc Unit and Festerday, is a metal band from Finland. It was formed in 1989 as a death metal band, but soon changed its style to symphonic black metal. It released its first album as ...and Oceans in 1998, and in the following years it pursued a less traditional, more industrial-oriented direction.

==History==
The band was formed in 1989 as Festerday and it originally played death metal. It changed name to ...and Oceans in 1995, and the band&#x27;s debut release was the symphonic black metal album &quot;Dynamic Gallery of Thoughts&quot;, released by Season of Mist. &quot;The Symmetry of I – The Circle of O&quot; followed in 1998. The band signed to Century Media, who issued the &quot;A.M. G.O.D.: Allotropic/Metamorphic Genesis of Dimorphism&quot; album, described by &quot;AllMusic&quot; as &quot;definitely one of the band&#x27;s finest&quot;, and the band&#x27;s profile was raised by a European tour with Marduk, Vader, and Mortician. The band&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Cypher&quot; was described by &quot;Allmusic&quot; as &quot;Scandinavian cyber-metal&quot;, &quot;sounding as if Skinny Puppy and Cannibal Corpse have spawned some kind of terrible, shrieking cyborg baby&quot;. Band members also played in Rotten Sound, Deathbound, and 6 Billion Ways to Die.

===Havoc Unit===
After ten years of existence as ...and Oceans and four full-length albums, the band changed its name to Havoc Unit in 2005. Its first album under the new name was &quot;h.IV+ (Hoarse Industrial Viremia)&quot;, released in 2008. After five years, in 2013 band&#x27;s name returned to be Festerday.

===Return as ...&quot;And Oceans&quot;===
On January 14, 2020, heavy metal label Season of Mist announced the upcoming release of &quot;Cosmic World Mother&quot;, a new album from the band, now reformed as ...&quot;And Oceans.&quot; 

In October 2022, the band announced their upcoming album, &quot;As in Gardens, So in Tombs&quot;, would be released on January 27, 2023.

<text>Manerbio (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, northern Italy. It received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on May 14, 1997.

== Toponomy ==

The name &quot;Manerbio&quot; derives from Latin &quot;Minervium&quot;, due to the ancient necropolis found in its territory which was sacred to Minerva, a Roman goddess.

== History ==

The territory was inhabited since the Neolithic. During the Bronze Age, where are actually present the &quot;Madonna della Stalla&quot; and the &quot;Fornasetta&quot; farmhouses, there were two etruscan villages. Afterwards, the Celts inhabited the area. In the Manerbio countryside, has been founded some celtic phaleras from the 1st century BC (now contained in the Santa Giulia Museum, in Brescia) and 4200 &quot;dracme padane&quot;, silver money from the 2nd and the 1st century BC.

During the Roman era, Manerbio (lat. &quot;Minervium&quot;) was crossed by the &quot;Via Brixiana&quot;, a Roman consular road which connected Cremona &quot;(lat&quot;. &quot;Cremona&quot;) to Brescia (&quot;lat. Brixia&quot;), from which Roman roads passed and then branched out towards the entire Cisalpine Gaul. Between the 1st century BC and the 3rd century AD, in Manerbio was located a necropolis sacred to Minerva. During this period, in Manerbio was also located at least five Roman villas.

During the Middle Ages, in Manerbio was located a castle which during the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines get besieged and destroyed by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV (1191) and by the King of Sicily Charles of Anjou (1271). Due to the conflict between the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, it get renewed and engaged in sieges several times.

During the Venetian rule, the town was at the head of its Quadra.

Manerbio began to be a point of reference for the neighbouring town when, due to the Battle of Solferino (1859), arose many rescue facilities which subsequently evolved in a hospital.

In 1907 started the &quot;Lanificio di Manerbio&quot;&#x27;s activity, which became &quot;Marzotto&quot; in 1927. It was the biggest industrial building in the &quot;Bassa Bresciana&quot; until its closure (2003).

== Transportation ==
Manerbio has a railway station on the Brescia–Cremona line.

== Notable people ==

* Angelo Aimo, Italian retired footballer

<doc id="1087499" wikidata="Q468855" url="?curid=1087499" title="Kidnapping and killing of Margaret Hassan">
<text>Margaret Hassan (; 18 April 1945 – 8 November 2004) was an Irish aid worker who had worked in Iraq for many years until she was abducted by unidentified assailants in Baghdad during the Iraqi insurgency. Her captors subsequently filmed and released a video of her stating that she was living her &quot;last hours&quot; before she pleaded for the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq; she has not been seen since, and her remains were never recovered.

Hassan was born in Dublin, Ireland, in the final months of World War II. Her family soon immigrated to the United Kingdom, where she ended up marrying an Iraqi man who had been studying in London. She relocated to Iraq with him in the 1970s, eventually learning Arabic and becoming an Iraqi citizen. Hassan remained in Baghdad during the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War.

== Life and career ==
She was born Margaret Fitzsimons in Dalkey, County Dublin, Ireland, to parents Peter and Mary Fitzsimons. However, soon after the end of World War II her family moved to London, England, where she spent most of her early life and where her younger siblings were born.

=== Marriage and immigration to Iraq ===
At the age of 27, she married Tahseen Ali Hassan, a 29-year-old Iraqi man studying engineering in the United Kingdom. She moved to Iraq with him in 1972, where she began work with the British Council of Baghdad, teaching English. Eventually she learned Arabic and became an Iraqi citizen.

She remained a Roman Catholic throughout her life and never converted to Islam as was widely reported after her death. A requiem Mass was held for her, after her death was confirmed, at Westminster Cathedral by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor.

During the early 1980s, Hassan became the assistant director of studies at the British Council; later in the decade she became director. Meanwhile, Tahseen worked as an economist. She remained in Baghdad during the 1991 Gulf War, although the British Council suspended operations in Iraq, and she was left jobless at the end of it.

=== Gulf War aid efforts ===
Hassan joined humanitarian relief organisation CARE International in 1991, the aid group having established itself in Iraq during that year. Sanitation, health, and nutrition became major concerns in the sanctioned Iraq; she became a vocal critic of the United Nations restrictions. She was opposed to the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003, arguing before it that the Iraqis were already &quot;living through a terrible emergency. They do not have the resources to withstand an additional crisis brought about by military action&quot;. Margaret was crucially involved in bringing leukaemia medicine to child cancer victims in Iraq in 1998.

By 2004, she was head of Iraqi operations for CARE. Well known in many of Baghdad&#x27;s slums and other cities, Hassan was especially interested in Iraq&#x27;s young people, whom she called &quot;the lost generation&quot;. Her presence could draw large crowds of locals.

== Abduction during the Iraq War ==
Hassan was kidnapped in Baghdad on 19 October 2004, and was killed some weeks later on 8 November. In a video released of her in captivity she pleaded for the withdrawal of British troops. She stated that &quot;these might be [her] last hours&quot;, &quot;Please help me. The British people, tell Mr Tony Blair to take the troops out of Iraq and not bring them here to Baghdad&quot;, and that she did not &quot;want to die like Mr Bigley&quot;, a reference to Kenneth Bigley, who had been executed in Iraq only weeks earlier.

Patients of an Iraqi hospital (where her work had some effect) took to the streets in protest against the hostage takers&#x27; actions. On 25 October, between 100 and 200 Iraqis protested outside CARE&#x27;s offices in Baghdad, demanding her release. Prominent elements of the Iraqi insurgency, such as the Shura Council of Fallujah Mujahideen, along with Iraqi political figures such as the Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the kidnapping and called for her release. On 2 November, Al Jazeera reported that the kidnappers threatened to hand her over to the group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who were responsible for the execution of Kenneth Bigley. On 6 November, a statement purportedly from al-Zarqawi appeared on an Islamist website calling for the release of Hassan unless the kidnappers had information she was aligned with the invading coalition. However, the statement could not be authenticated. Hassan&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown in the video.

On 15 November, US Marines in Fallujah uncovered the body of an unidentified blonde- or grey-haired woman with her legs and arms cut off and throat slit. The body could not be immediately identified, but was thought unlikely to be Hassan, who had brown hair. There was one other Western woman known missing in Iraq at the time the body was discovered, Teresa Borcz Khalifa, 54, Polish-born and also a long-time Iraqi resident. Khalifa was found alive and rescued from her hostage takers on 20 November.

On 16 November, CNN reported that &#x27;CARE&#x27; had issued a statement indicating that the organisation was aware of a videotape showing Hassan&#x27;s execution. Al Jazeera reported that it had received a tape showing Hassan&#x27;s murder but was unable to confirm its authenticity. The video showed Hassan being shot with a handgun by a masked man. It is not known who was responsible for Hassan&#x27;s abduction and alleged murder.

The group holding her never identified itself in the hostage videos.

=== Aftermath ===
CARE International suspended operations in Iraq because of Hassan&#x27;s kidnapping. The last CARE project Hassan completed was one for children with spinal injuries. The director of the spinal cord clinic she supported in Baghdad, Qayder al-Chalabi, called her loss a huge blow to all Iraqis. &quot;(The killers) made a very big mistake. This was a wrong person&quot;, he said on 17 November. &quot;We need to admire and remember her. We must have a ceremony every year to remember her&quot;. He believed that a statue should be erected in her honour.

At least eight other women kidnapped and tortured by insurgents during the conflict were found and rescued from captivity (Simona Pari, Simona Torretta, Florence Aubenas, Giuliana Sgrena, Teresa Borcz Khalifa, Hannelore Krause, Marie Jeanne Ion, and Jill Carroll). It is unclear why Margaret Hassan, who was opposed to the war, lived in Iraq for many years, held Iraqi citizenship, was married to an Arab Muslim and spoke fluent Arabic was killed; the kidnappers did not identify their group nor their aims. In 2010, her family said that they continued to hope that her remains would be found and returned to them for a Christian burial.

==Investigation==
On 1 May 2005, three men were questioned by Iraqi police in connection with the murder. On 5 June 2006, news reports emerged that an Iraqi man by the name of Mustafa Salman al-Jubouri has been sentenced to life imprisonment for &quot;aiding and abetting the kidnappers&quot; but two other men were acquitted. Margaret Hassan&#x27;s family said the verdict left them &quot;devastated and appalled&quot;. It is unclear what role the others who were acquitted played in the kidnapping or the role of the suspect who was found guilty. Al-Jubouri appealed this sentence and was given a shorter imprisonment.

=== Arrest of Ali Lufti Jassar al-Rawi (2008) ===
An Iraqi man named Ali Lutfi Jassar al-Rawi, also known as Abu Rasha, an architect from Baghdad, was arrested by Iraqi and US forces in 2008 after contacting the British Embassy in Baghdad and attempting to extort 1 million dollars in return for disclosing the location of Hassan&#x27;s body. He reportedly had knowledge of an intimate detail about Hassan, known only to her closest relatives and friends, which he used to validate his knowledge of her whereabouts. Though Jassar signed statements confessing to the charges, he pleaded not guilty, stating he was forced to sign them after receiving beatings and electrical shocks during questioning. &quot;I have nothing to do with Hassan&#x27;s abduction and I did not see or talk to her,&quot; Jassar said.

On 2 June 2009, the Press Association reported that Jassar was given a life sentence by Baghdad&#x27;s Central Criminal Court for being involved in Hassan&#x27;s abduction and murder, and for attempting to blackmail the British Embassy. Hassan&#x27;s family welcomed the court&#x27;s decision but pleaded with Jassar to tell them where her body is so they can return her to Britain for burial.

===Escape of Jassar from prison (2010)===
On 14 July 2010, a day before Jassar was due to appear in court for retrial, it was reported that he could not be located in the prison facility where he was being held. He had been missing for a month. He had not appeared at any of the previous retrial dates, which led to concerns that he had been released. Jassar recently transferred to a Baghdad jail after being held in northern Iraq. Jassar was not found after checking with both facilities. The director of Iraq&#x27;s prisoner transfer system told an appeals judge that the killer&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown. Hassan&#x27;s family and lawyer believe the prisoner has escaped.

On 22 August 2010 Iraq&#x27;s deputy justice minister, Busho Ibrahim, said Jassar had been helped to escape from Baghdad central prison, formerly Abu Ghraib, during riots in September 2009 stating that &quot;This guy [Jassar], he escaped from prison. People facilitated his escape, he is gone,&quot; and that &quot;He seized the opportunity of the riots in the prison in September 2009 and he escaped. He was the only one who escaped&quot;. The minister also added that he discovered Jassar&#x27;s escape about &quot;20 or 30 days ago.&quot;

<doc id="1087501" wikidata="Q732671" url="?curid=1087501" title="King Kong Bundy">
<text>Christopher Alan Pallies (November 7, 1955 – March 4, 2019) was an American professional wrestler, stand-up comedian and actor better known by his wrestling gimmick and ring name, King Kong Bundy. Under this gimmick, he portrayed a pugnacious, trash-talking villain character. 

He appeared in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s and wrestled in the main event of WrestleMania 2 in 1986, facing Hulk Hogan in a steel cage match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He also headlined the inaugural Survivor Series in 1987, as well as the first edition of Extreme Championship Wrestling&#x27;s flagship event, November to Remember, in 1993.

==Early life==
Christopher Alan Pallies was born in Woodbury, New Jersey, on November 7, 1957, to Donald Pallies, a railroad freight agent, and Margret (McCarthy) Pallies, a department store clerk. He attended Washington Township High School in Sewell, New Jersey, graduating in 1974. He had two sisters and three brothers. While in high school, Pallies wrestled heavyweight on the wrestling team. He won two regional titles. His brother Jeff, also a member of the wrestling team, later wrestled for Glassboro State, now known as Rowan University. He was a two-time Metro Conference champion.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1981–1985)===
Pallies was trained to wrestle by Larry Sharpe at the &quot;Monster Factory&quot; in Bellmawr, New Jersey. He debuted on March 7, 1981, wrestling for the World Wrestling Federation under the ring name &quot;Chris Canyon&quot;. His first victory was against Strong Kobayashi in WWF on July 10, 1981. In the early years of his career, he also used the name &quot;Chris Cannon&quot;. In 1982, Pallies relocated to Texas, where he joined the World Class Championship Wrestling. He was developed by the Von Erich family as the babyface &quot;Big Daddy Bundy&quot; (after Shirley Crabtree&#x27;s &quot;Big Daddy&quot; moniker), wearing blue jeans with a rope belt, but turned heel following a dispute with the Von Erich Family, and was recruited by &quot;Playboy&quot; Gary Hart and dramatically reintroduced as &quot;King Kong Bundy&quot;, with the &quot;Big Daddy&quot; portion of his moniker replaced by the name of cinematic monster, King Kong, wearing the black singlet for the first time to signify his change. He lost his hair during the feud, adding to his signature look. Bundy was Fritz Von Erich&#x27;s opponent for Fritz&#x27;s 1982 retirement match at the Fritz Von Erich Retirement Show held at the Texas Stadium. He also competed in various territories such as the American Wrestling Association and Georgia Championship Wrestling where he teamed with the Masked Superstar to defeat his former stablemates the Road Warriors for the NWA National Tag Team Championship. He also had a tendency to demand a five-count (as opposed to the usual three count) for pinfalls whenever he dominated his opponent in a squash match, a gimmick he began while wrestling for Mid-South Wrestling. During this time Bundy also wrestled in Memphis often teaming with Rick Rude and Jim Neidhart against opponents such as Jerry Lawler.

===World Wrestling Federation (1985–1988)===
====WWF Championship pursuit (1985–1986) ====

After making a few appearances on New Japan Pro-Wrestling/World Wrestling Federation joint shows in early 1985, Bundy officially debuted in the WWF on the March 16, 1985 airing of &quot;WWF Championship Wrestling&quot;, defeating Mario Mancini. First managed by Jimmy Hart, he was immediately pushed with dominating victories over all of his opponents. Bundy also reprised his gimmick of demanding a five-count from the referee while pinning an opponent, to show how badly he had beaten his hapless opponent. He defeated S. D. Jones in what was announced as only nine seconds at the first WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden (it was actually about 17 seconds).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bundy/Jones&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This remained the shortest match in WrestleMania history until 2008 when Kane defeated Chavo Guerrero Jr. in a legitimate eight seconds at WrestleMania XXIV.

In September 1985, Hart traded Bundy to manager Bobby Heenan in exchange for Adrian Adonis and The Missing Link. After joining the Heenan Family, Bundy feuded extensively with André the Giant, a feud which started during an angle where Bundy interfered in one of André&#x27;s matches and delivered several splashes, giving the Giant a broken sternum. They feuded for several months, including a pair of tag team matches on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; in late 1985, where Bundy, and André&#x27;s other nemesis, Big John Studd, first faced André and Tony Atlas and then André and WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan. On September 23, 1985, Bundy faced André the Giant at Madison Square Garden in a match billed as &quot;the Colossal Jostle&quot;. André dominated the match, with the match ending after Big John Studd came from the locker rooms to Bundy&#x27;s aid and attacked the Giant, causing a disqualification. Bundy also began targeting Hogan and the WWF World Championship in late 1985. At &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event V&quot;, Hogan was dominating challenger the Magnificent Muraco when Bundy (with Heenan in tow) ran to ambush Hogan. With Muraco&#x27;s help, Bundy repeatedly gave Hogan avalanches and big splashes, which caused Hogan to severely bruise his ribs. Bundy demanded a match and claimed Hogan was afraid of him, setting up their feud. Hogan demanded revenge and agreed to a steel cage match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship as the main event of WrestleMania 2 in the Los Angeles portion of the event, which Hogan won.

==== Various feuds (1986–1988) ====
Later in 1986, Bundy reformed his tag-team partnership with Studd and began a feud with The Machines, Bill Eadie and Blackjack Mulligan wrestling under masks (as the Super Machine and Big Machine, respectively) and often joined by Andre the Giant (as the Giant Machine). The storyline was that Bundy and Studd, along with Heenan, claimed that the Giant Machine was a masked Andre the Giant, and was competing under the mask and alias to circumvent an earlier suspension (due to no-showing for an event), but none of them ever proved that Andre and the Giant Machine were one and the same. Eventually, Bundy and Studd began teaming up with Heenan in a series of six-man tag team matches against the Machines (usually, Big and Super; as Andre&#x27;s health was starting to deteriorate at this time, the Giant Machine made occasional appearances, but more often than not, it was either Captain Lou Albano or a number of popular faces—often, Hogan, Roddy Piper and others—who teamed with the other Machines). Bundy and Studd were regularly beaten, but won their last match over the Super-Big version of the Machines at Madison Square Garden. Also in the latter half of 1986, Bundy and Studd received shots at the WWF Tag Team Championship against The British Bulldogs, but were unsuccessful, often losing by disqualification. Studd left the WWF shortly after their last match with the Machines, and Bundy went back to singles competition.

At WrestleMania III, Bundy was involved in a mixed six-man tag team match, teaming up with midget wrestlers Little Tokyo and Lord Littlebrook against Hillbilly Jim, the Haiti Kid and Little Beaver. During the match, after being pestered by Beaver, Bundy body-slammed him and delivered a big elbow, causing his team&#x27;s disqualification and his own tag partners to turn against him. At the 1987 King of the Ring on September 4, Bundy made it to the finals of the King of the Ring tournament, where he was defeated by Randy Savage. In November 1987, Bundy defeated Hulk Hogan via a count-out on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XIII&quot;, but lost to Hogan in a rematch on the next episode of the series; the match was best known for the referee becoming legitimately injured when he was accidentally caught between Hogan and a charging Bundy, and Andre the Giant&#x27;s post-match attack of Hogan shortly after Bundy left ringside. Although no longer appearing on the WWF&#x27;s syndicated TV shows, Bundy continued to wrestle house shows in early 1988 (often losing to Bam Bam Bigelow); his last match during his initial WWF run was a televised match at Madison Square Garden in February 1988, teaming up with Butch Reed in a loss to Don Muraco and The Ultimate Warrior.

=== Semi-retirement (1988–1994) ===
After leaving the WWF in 1988, Bundy went into semi-retirement, wrestling only a handful of matches. In 1993, he wrestled in the main event of Eastern Championship Wrestling&#x27;s inaugural November to Remember supercard, appearing as the mystery tag team partner of Terry Funk in a losing effort against Road Warrior Hawk and Sabu. On May 13, 1994, Bundy defeated Papa Shango at NWA New Jersey. In the summer of 1994, he made a couple of appearances for United States Wrestling Association and also feuded with &quot;Friendly&quot; Frank Finnegan in the WWA in 1994.

=== Return to WWF (1994–1995) ===
Bundy returned to the WWF in the fall of 1994 as a member of Ted DiBiase&#x27;s stable, The Million Dollar Corporation. He had a successful pay-per-view return at the Survivor Series, when he and fellow &quot;Million Dollar Team&quot; member Bam Bam Bigelow survived a match against Lex Luger&#x27;s &quot;Guts and Glory&quot; team. Bundy was then billed as a favorite in the 1995 Royal Rumble, but lasted only three minutes before being eliminated by another big man, Mabel. Bundy made his return to WrestleMania at WrestleMania XI, where he was defeated by the Undertaker, Bundy was later pushed down the card before being released in October 1995 after teaming with Kama losing to Bam Bam Bigelow and Henry O. Godwinn for a dark match for WWF Superstars of Wrestling.

=== Late career (1995–2007)===
After leaving the WWF in late 1995, Bundy wrestled for several independent promotions in the United States including the WWA where he had wrestled in 1994. In April 1997, he resurfaced in magazines when he joined a faction managed by Kenny Casanova called &quot;Camp Casanova&quot; along with &quot;Danger&quot; Dave DeJohn and the Masked Maniac at times in USWF, NBW, and USA Power Pro Wrestling. In a match against &quot;the Seven Foot Tall&quot; Primo Canera III, Bundy knee-dropped his opponent and then &quot;Bundy-splashed&quot; him. The impact actually broke the ring, leaving the two grapplers in a pit in the center of the squared circle. This independent footage was picked up by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;. His feuds against &quot;Superfly&quot; Jimmy Snuka, Doink the Clown, and Tom Brandi were among many main events in the northeast independent circuit. In 1999, at the Kolf Arena in Oshkosh, Wisconsin he won the AWA Superstars of Wrestling Heavyweight Championship from Jonnie Stewart. Later that same year, Bundy the reigning AWA heavyweight champion, wrestled again headlining an AWA &quot;Super Event&quot; at the Dee Events Center in Ogden, Utah. That night ended differently for Bundy, losing a &quot;body-slam match&quot; to Koszmar Polski who was managed by Ken Patera. Bundy still wrestled across the country, primarily in the Southern and Eastern United States. He generally continued to be a headliner and a crowd favorite at all events he attended. King Kong Bundy&#x27;s last match is thought to have been at the Legends of Wrestling Show at the Pulaski County Fair in Somerset, Kentucky in 2007. Bundy lost to &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan in that main event. He defeated Richard Byrne in May 2007 at Big Time Wrestling in Springfield, Massachusetts in which was also his last and final match of his wrestling career.

==Acting and stand-up comedy career==
In 1986, Pallies appeared in television commercials and print advertisements for the Vendex HeadStart personal computer. Bundy had two guest spots and one big part on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, as the creators had named the lead characters &quot;Bundy&quot; as an homage to him. In 1987, he played Uncle Irwin, the brother of Peggy Bundy. In 1995, he appeared again as the King Kong Bundy character, teaching Bud how to wrestle. In 1988, he appeared in the Richard Pryor film &quot;Moving&quot; as Gorgo, part of a trio of ex-cons who are insolent and careless movers. In 1996, he appeared on an episode of &quot;Weird Science&quot; as himself. He is on the cover of Belgian band Belgian Asociality&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Kabaal&quot;. On April 24, 2008, he was on a Norwegian TV show called &quot;Golden GOAL!&quot;. Bundy also starred as Otto Belmar in the 2011 independent film &quot;Fight the Panda Syndicate&quot;.

After retiring from wrestling, Pallies would also try a career in stand-up comedy. He would perform regularly at various comedy clubs such as the Coffee Dot Comedy in Sea Isle City.

==Personal life==
Pallies was previously married and had a stepson named David that Pallies raised as his own. Pallies was fond of cats and had &quot;about 10&quot; at the time of his death.

In July 2016, Pallies joined a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred &quot;long term neurological injuries&quot; and that the company &quot;routinely failed to care&quot; for them and &quot;fraudulently misrepresented and concealed&quot; the nature and extent of those injuries. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The case was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018. Anthony Mango of Bleacher Report wrote that Pallies had a strained relationship with WWE over the years and his involvement in the lawsuit likely prevented the company from inducting him into their Hall of Fame.

===Death===
On March 4, 2019, Pallies died from complications of diabetes at his home in Glassboro, New Jersey, at the age of 61.

<doc id="1087510" wikidata="Q3245407" url="?curid=1087510" title="List of high commissioners of the United Kingdom to New Zealand">
<text>The high commissioner of the United Kingdom to New Zealand is the United Kingdom&#x27;s foremost diplomatic representative in New Zealand, and head of the UK&#x27;s diplomatic mission in New Zealand. As the United Kingdom and New Zealand are fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, their diplomatic relations are at governmental level, rather than between heads of state. Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.

The British high commissioner to New Zealand is also the non-resident governor of the Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands, a British Overseas Territory, and formerly non-resident high commissioner to the Independent State of Samoa. Besides the high commission in Wellington, the UK government maintains a consulate general in Auckland.

<text>Marone (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy.

== Physical geography ==

=== Territory ===
Marone is located on the eastern shore of Lake Iseo at about 200 m a.s.l. The territory is mainly mountainous. It borders to the north with Toline, a fraction of the municipality of Pisogne; to the east with the town of Zone and to the south with Sale Marasino.

There are two main water streams: the &quot;Bagnadore&quot; and the &quot;Opol&quot;. The latter descends from Passo Croce di Marone, receiving the Sestola stream, which has an underground channel that has been very important for the industrial development of the town.

== History ==
In Roman times, Marone was crossed by an important consular road, the Via Valeriana, which connected Brescia (lat. &quot;Brixia&quot;) with the Camonica Valley (lat. &quot;Vallis Camunnorum&quot;) coasting Lake Iseo (lat. &quot;Sebinus lacus&quot;).

Some archaeological findings found in the remains of a Roman villa in a locality called &quot;Cò de Ela&quot; could demonstrate the fact that the first settlements occurred in Roman times.

In the Middle Ages, the inhabitants settled in more defensible locations, far from the lake and streams, such as Pregasso, where in the 10th century there was a castle, which was later destroyed by a fire.

Marone became the administrative centre from the second half of the 16th century, when its development as an industrial center began.

== Economy ==
Since the 16th century, Marone has been considered one of the most important industrial centres of Lake Iseo. Currently the main activities are the processing of wool, the production of felts and the extraction of dolomite.

In recent times, starting from the 10s of 2000, olive-growing has spread, from which the typical Lombard olive oil is produced. The municipality is also part of the national association &quot;Città dell&#x27;Olio&quot; since 2001.

<text>Buyantu Khan (Mongolian: Буянт хаан; Mongolian script: ; ), born Ayurbarwada (Mongolian: Аюурбарбад ; ), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Renzong of Yuan (, April 9, 1285 – March 1, 1320), was the fourth emperor of the Yuan dynasty of China. In addition to being the Emperor of China, he is regarded as the eighth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire. His regnal name &quot;Buyantu Khan&quot; means &quot;blessed/good Khan&quot; in the Mongolian language. His personal name &quot;Ayurbarwada&quot; was derived from a Sanskrit compound &quot;Āyurpārvata&quot; (), which means &quot;the mountain of longevity&quot;, in contrast with Emperor Wuzong&#x27;s name Qaišan (海山, &quot;mountains and seas&quot; in Chinese).

Ayurbarwada was the first Yuan emperor who actively supported the adoption of Confucian principles into the administration system. The emperor, who was mentored by the Confucian academic Li Meng, succeeded peacefully to the throne and reversed his older brother Khayisan&#x27;s policies. More importantly, Ayurbarwada reinstituted the civil service examination system for the Yuan dynasty.

== Struggle for succession ==

Ayurbarwada was the second son of Darmabala and Dagi (Targi) of the Khunggirat, and a great-grandson of Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294). He had been tutored by the Confucian scholar Li Meng, who strongly affected his future political attitudes from his early teens.

In 1305 Bulugan Khatun removed Ayurbarwada from the court and sent him to Honan as the prince of Huai-ning. However, his uncle Temür Khan died without an heir on February 2, 1307, because his son Deshou had died a year earlier before him.

Temür&#x27;s widow Bulugan of the Bayaud tribe had kept away the Khunggirad-mothered brothers of Khayishan and Ayurbarwada and attempted to set up her favorite, the Muslim Ananda, their uncle and the governor of Ningxia. The Darkhan Harghasun, the right chancellor () of the government who became aware of Bulugan&#x27;s plan, recalled Ayurbarwada and Li Meng from Huaizhou () to the capital Dadu. They successfully developed a strategy to imprison both Ananda and Bulugan. Afterwards, Ayurbarwada welcomed his older brother Khayishan, who was still far away from Dadu, to succeed to the throne. After the latter&#x27;s coronation, Ayurbarwada was appointed the Crown Prince in June 1307. The brothers promised each other that their descendants would rule in succession.

== Early career under Külüg Khan and enthronement==

Ayurbarwada was made head of the top central administrative organs known as the Zhongshu Sheng under his brother and predecessor Khayishan Külüg Khan. He had surrounded himself with the Chinese scholars Chen Hao, Wang I, Wang Yueh, Zhao Mengfu, Wang Chieh, Chan Yaoho, Shang-ye, Yao sui, and Hsia ku; the artists Shang cheng and Wang Cheng-peng; Chagaan, a scholar from Balkh and Haiya, the Uyghur lyricist.

He was able to read and write Chinese and appreciate Chinese paintings and calligraphy in addition to his deep knowledge of Confucianism and Chinese history. Strongly influenced by Confucian political ethics, he was naturally opposed to his brother&#x27;s exploitative policies. Khayishan&#x27;s partisans had accused Li Meng of having advised Ayurbarwada to keep the throne for himself; Li Meng left the court immediately after Khayishan&#x27;s accession. Ayurbarwada spoke out in Li Meng&#x27;s defence but accomplished nothing much in the end. His disagreement with his brother&#x27;s high officials remained concealed until his own enthronement.

Khayishan died in January 1311. Unlike the succession struggle over Yuan throne in 1307, Ayurbarwada&#x27;s succession to his elder brother Khayishan&#x27;s throne in April 1311 was a peaceful and smooth transition of the Yuan imperial history. This was made possible by the fact that he was designated by Khayishan as the heir apparent in June 1307, in accordance with their earlier agreement, and had subsequently appointed him as the titular head of the Zhongshu Sheng, similar to Kublai Khan had done when grooming Zhenjin to be his successor. He was saluted under the title of Buyantu in his accession kuriltai.

==Reformation==

While one might expect a general continuity in policy and personnel between the two reigns in view of the fraternal love between Khaishan and Ayurbawada and the peaceful way in which one succeeded the other, what was to happen early in Ayurbarwada&#x27;s reign was actually the opposite: a political purge of Khaishan&#x27;s chief ministers and a reversal of most of his policies. These reversals of policies can be traced to Ayurbarwada&#x27;s cultural and ideological orientation and his uneasy political relationship with his late brother. Strongly influenced by Confucian political ethics as he was, he was naturally opposed to the exploitative policies carried out by the Department of State Affairs under Khaishan.

Ayurbarwada was highlighted for his reform efforts based on Confucianism principle for the Yuan government, though these reforms were made at the displeasure of some Mongol nobility. As soon as he ascended to the throne, he disbanded of the Department of State Affairs set up during Khayishan&#x27;s reign, which resulted in the execution of 5 high-ranking officials. He also abolished the Zhida paper notes and coins issued by the court of Khayishan; and restored the Zhongtong and Zhiyuan notes as the only official currency. The bureaucracy was trimmed to the 1293 level and new high offices were reduced to the original status they had had in Kublai&#x27;s reign. The various public building projects of Khayisan were halted. He made Li Meng and Zhang Kui grand councillors in addition to appointing others including Mongols and Semuren (a caste of assorted peoples from Central Asia and the west). The Office of Market Taxes, which was set up to supervise merchants, was abolished with the attempt at abolition by the Semuren. Although he abolished most of Khayishan&#x27;s policies, converting official salaries into Zhiyuan notes was kept. Aside from that, the court also restored the &quot;salary rice&quot; policy decreed by Temür Khan in 1320. Ayurbarwada decreed that 30 percent of all court officials&#x27; salaries were to be paid with rice.

The most prominent reform he made was the reintroduction of the imperial examination system for public officials similar to the one in previous dynasties of China. The imperial examination system, though had repeated been debated during Kublai&#x27;s reign, had not put into effect until this time. It was now based entirely on Neo-Confucianism, which was thus established as the state philosophy of China for many centuries ever since. A race-based quotas were set for these examinations, allowing a certain number of both Mongol and Han Chinese to enter the government as civil officials. For example, starting in 1313 examinations were introduced for prospective officials – testing their knowledge on significant historical works – in 1315 300 appointments went to the court, with an extra quarter of the positions being given to non-Han Chinese people.

Codification of the law was another area in which Ayurbarwada&#x27;s efforts to reform the Yuan Dynasty produced the desired results. In the same month that he was enthroned in 1311, he instructed the Zhongshu Sheng to systematize the codes and regulations promulgated since the beginning of Kublai&#x27;s reign. This compilation and editing was completed in 1316, though the process of reviewing the collection was not completely until 1323, under his son and successor Shidibala, who formally promulgated it under the title Da Yuan Tong Zhi (Chinese: 大元通制, &quot;the comprehensive institutions of the Great Yuan&quot;). In some ways the new code also reflected certain Mongolian customs and the institutional features peculiar to the Mongol dynasty in the history of China. 

He believed that the Mongol elites and the Semuren had to learn from Confucian political philosophy and Chinese historical experience in order to govern China. During the reign of Ayurbarwada, a number of Chinese books and works were translated or published with Ayurbarwada&#x27;s authorization. This can also reveal his fondness for Chinese culture and his and his officials&#x27; (especially the Mongols and Central Asians) desire to benefit from Confucian political wisdom and Chinese historical experience. Examples of these translated or published books and works include the Confucian classic &quot;Shang Shu&quot; (Chinese: 尚書, &quot;Book of history&quot;), &quot;Daxue Yanyi&quot; (Chinese: 大學衍義, &quot;Extended meaning of the Great Learning&quot;), &quot;Zhenguan Zhengyao&quot; (貞觀政要, &quot;Essentials of the government of the Zhenguan period&quot;), and the &quot;Xiao Jing&quot; (孝經, &quot;Books of filial piety&quot;).

In the winter of 1311 Ayurbarwada ordered the abolition of the jarghuchi (judge) of the princely establishments that was created by Ögedei Khan (r. 1229–1241) and placed all Mongolian violators under the jurisdiction of chienbu while attempting to restrict separate appanage judges. He restricted the position jarghuchi to judicial affairs and organized them under the Court of the Imperial Clan.

Early in his reign Ayurbarwada encouraged agriculture to increase the state revenue. His senior councillor, Temuder, took drastic measures which included collecting salt and iron monopoly taxes and the state monopoly over foreign trade under the Maritime Trade Supervisorate. Despite commercial ties with Europe increased, Ayurbarwada&#x27;s administration, led by Temuder, unsuccessfully attempted a new cadastral survey called &quot;Yanyou Jingli&quot; () which involves a comprehensive land survey in 1314. If it had been implemented properly, this survey would have greatly increased the state revenue and helped a more effective tax structure. Ineffective implementation of the survey by corrupt officials caused widespread hardship and resentment. As a result, a serious revolt broke out in Jiangxi in the fall of 1315. Although the revolt was suppressed within two months, it forced the government to abandon the survey program completely to relieve the situation.

Ayurbarwada also granted diploma (yarliq) to exempt the Franciscans from any taxation in 1314. The friars were still expected to pray for the Emperor&#x27;s life and give their blessing on ceremonial occasions.

Temuder chipped away at the autonomy of the princely appanages and executed Confucian opponents. Since Temuder was viewed by Confucians as an &quot;evil minister&quot;, opponents of fiscal centralization charged Temuder with corruption; and Buyantu Khan had to dismiss him in 1317. Unwilling to oppose his mother Dagi (Targi), Ayurbarwada could not eliminate Temuder.

Internationally, Ayurbarwada continued his ancestors&#x27; imperialistic policies. He reminded the vassal states of his accession, and told them to remember and send their tribute at the proper time, and assured them that he would make punitive actions if they failed. Among the tributary princes to whom he notified his advent to the throne are named those of Champa, Annam, an island near Japan, Malabar, and kingdoms on the borders of Yunnan.

The reign of Ayurbarwada also saw the Esen Buqa–Ayurbarwada war between the Chagatai Khanate under Esen Buqa I and the Ayurbarwada&#x27;s Yuan dynasty and its ally the Ilkhanate under Öljaitü. The war ended with the victory for the Yuan and the Ilkhanate, but the peace only came after the death of Esen Buqa in 1318.

== Aftermath ==

Ayurbarwada died on March 1, 1320. After Khayishan died, Ayurbarwada reneged his promise later in his reign by making his own son Shidibala the new Crown Prince in 1316. Therefore, his son succeeded him instead of one of Khayisan&#x27;s sons.

His death created two decades of political turmoil. The Khunggirat faction under Temuder and Dagi became even more powerful at the court. After the assassination of Shidibala in 1323, none of his descendants ruled the Empire.

== Family ==

He had three consorts, only two gave him sons:

*Radnashiri Khatun, of the Hongjila clan (弘吉剌氏d. 1322) from Khongirad 
** Shidibala, &quot;Crown Prince&quot; ( 碩德八剌太子, 22 February 1302 – 4 September 1323), 1st son
*Dharmashiri Khatun, of the &quot;Korean&quot; Kim clan (答里麻失里)
** Udüs Büqa, Prince of Shunyang (順阳王), 2nd son
#Bayan Qutugh Khatun, of the Kaesong Wang clan (伯顔忽篤皇后), granddaughter of Wonjong of Goryeo
*Unknown
**Kökelün, Grand Princess of Lü State (闊闊倫 魯國公主), 1st daughter
***Married Duoluben Küregen, one of the descendants of Dai Setsen

<text>Salon-de-Provence (, ; or , ), commonly known as Salon, is a commune located about northwest of Marseille in the Bouches-du-Rhône department (Metropolis of Aix-Marseille Provence), region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, Southern France. It is the home of an important French Air and Space Force (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air et de l&#x27;Espace&quot;) air base.

==History==
Salon was a Gallo-Roman oppidum well positioned on the salt trade routes between Adriatic, Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, hence its name. This region was under the Phocaean influence since the sixth century BC, and stretches of the Via Aurelia can still be recognized just outside the town, but the earliest mention of the place under its familiar name is of the ninth century, as &quot;Villa Salone&quot;. The archbishops of Arles controlled the site.

Its principal claim to fame today is as the place where Nostradamus spent his last years and is buried. His dwelling is maintained as a museum, and for four days every June or July, the city celebrates its history during the time of Nostradamus, attracting tourists.

The historic center still lies within its circuit of walls, entered through two seventeenth-century gateways, the &quot;Porte de l&#x27;Horloge&quot; and the &quot;Porte du Bourg Neuf&quot;.

In 1559 the engineer Adam de Craponne opened the &quot;Canal de Craponne&quot; to bring fresh water from the river Durance to the town and the surrounding plain of Crau. Inexpensive freight brought commerce to Salon, and the town prospered.

==Sights==
===Château de l&#x27;Emperi===

The castle, which was the biggest in Provence during the 12th and 13th centuries and was mentioned as early as the tenth, still dominates the old town. It was the preferred residence of the bishops of Arles, when Provence was part of the Holy Roman Empire, hence its name. It became the property of the city after the French Revolution. After damage caused by the 1909 earthquake, it has been restored and now hosts a museum of military history. Every summer, it hosts an international classical music festival.

===Fontaine Moussue===
The fountain in Place Crousillat has existed since the 16th century. During the 20th century, limestone concretions and vegetation developed, giving the familiar mushroom aspect.

===St Michel Chapel===
Built during the 13th century, this chapel boasts a remarkable Romanesque tympanum featuring the paschal lamb.

===Collégiale Saint Laurent===
The current edifice was erected during 15th century by Cardinal Louis Aleman, who was then bishop of Arles.

===Salon-de-Provence Air Base===
Salon-de-Provence Air Base is the site of the French Air Force Academy, as well as the home of the French Aerial Demonstration team, the Patrouille de France.

===Market===
Every Wednesday the Place Morgan is host to a Provençal market.

== Culture ==
Each summer, the Château de l&#x27;Empéri hosts a festival of chamber music.

Some years the Château is the venue for &quot;Nostradamiques&quot; – an historical re-enactment of the time of Nostradamus which includes processions and a transformation of the old medieval downtown. One such re-enactment was performed by the television presenter Jean-Pierre Foucault. In 2006 Robert Hossein compered the closing ceremony of the re-enactment.

<text>Moniga del Garda (Gardesano: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in the Italian region Lombardy. The municipality, located on the southwest side of Lake Garda, is bounded by other communes of Padenghe sul Garda, Manerba del Garda and Soiano del Lago.

==History==

Thanks to the remains of a pile-dwelling village it has been possible to ascertain that this area was already populated during the Early Bronze Age (1800–200 b.C.).

In the second half of the 12th century it became a feud of Ugone da Poncarale and in 1196 it was donated to the monks of Leno. Moniga was subjected to a series of rules, among which that by the Republic of Venice and subsequently the Austrian Empire, with which it belonged until 1859.

From 1928 to 1947 it became a part of the Commune of Padenghe. Its unusual name is believed to come from that of the goddess Diana Muchina, who, according to the legend, was said to have a sanctuary in the area.

==Culture== 
Chiaretto, a rosé wine of a light cherry colour, owes its creation to local citizen Pompeo Molmenti, who dedicated his attention intensively to the cultivation of vines and wine on his estate in 1896. Moniga dedicates one events a year to this wine, the &quot;Italia in Rosa&quot; fair, held in June.

<doc id="1087536" wikidata="Q6143495" url="?curid=1087536" title="James Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope">
<text>James Richard Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope, (11 November 1880 – 15 August 1967), styled Viscount Mahon until 1905, was a British Conservative politician.

==Background==
Stanhope was the eldest son of Arthur Stanhope, 6th Earl Stanhope, and Evelyn Henrietta (née Pennefather), daughter of Richard Pennefather of Knockeevan, County Tipperary and Lady Emily Butler. The Hon. Edward Stanhope and Philip Stanhope, 1st Baron Weardale, were his uncles.

Lord Mahon was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards on 5 January 1901, and went with his battalion to serve in South Africa during the Second Boer War. Following the end of this war in June 1902, he returned with a large contingent of men from the guards regiments on board the SS &quot;Lake Michigan&quot;, which arrived in Southampton in October 1902.

==Political career==
Stanhope entered the House of Lords on the death of his father in 1905, and made his maiden speech in November 1909. He held his first office as Parliamentary Secretary to the War Office under David Lloyd George between 1918 and 1919. In 1924 he was appointed Civil Lord of the Admiralty under Stanley Baldwin, a post he held until the Conservatives lost power in 1929. The latter year he was also sworn of the Privy Council. After the formation of the National Government in 1931 he served under Ramsay MacDonald as Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty in 1931, as Under-Secretary of State for War between 1931 and 1934 and as Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the last year under the premiership of Stanley Baldwin. In 1934 he was made a Knight Companion of the Garter.

He entered the cabinet in June 1936 when Baldwin appointed him First Commissioner of Works. When Neville Chamberlain became Prime Minister in May 1937 Stanhope was made President of the Board of Education, and in February 1938 he also succeeded Edward Wood, 3rd Viscount Halifax, as Leader of the House of Lords. In October 1938 he became First Lord of the Admiralty while continuing as Leader of the House of Lords. After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, he was succeeded as First Lord of the Admiralty by Winston Churchill and appointed Lord President of the Council. He remained as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President until Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940. However, he did not serve in the Churchill coalition government and never returned to ministerial office. He made his last speech in the House of Lords in December 1960.

In July 1940, Stanhope and several other national politicians—including Baldwin and Chamberlain—were targeted in the polemic &quot;Guilty Men&quot;. This publication accused these men of failing to prepare Britain for the looming war, and of appeasing Nazi Germany during the 1930s. The accusations made in &quot;Guilty Men&quot; have subsequently been questioned by some critics.

==Family==
Lord Stanhope married Lady Eileen Browne (1889–1940), the eldest daughter of George Browne, 6th Marquess of Sligo, and Agatha Stewart Hodgson, granddaughter of William Forsyth. They had no children. She died in September 1940, aged 51. With the death of Edward Scudamore-Stanhope, 12th Earl of Chesterfield, in 1952, Lord Stanhope inherited the peerage titles Earl of Chesterfield and Baron Stanhope, but did not apply for a writ of summons for the more senior Earldom of Chesterfield, and continued to be known as The Earl Stanhope. Stanhope died in August 1967, aged 86. On his death both earldoms and the barony of Stanhope became extinct, whereas the viscountcy of Stanhope of Mahon and the barony of Stanhope of Elvaston passed to his nearest heir, William Stanhope, 11th Earl of Harrington. Lord Stanhope left his country seat Chevening to the nation.

<text>The Thistle is an American planing sailing dinghy that was designed by Sandy Douglass as a one-design racer and first built in 1945.

==Production==
The design was originally built by Douglass &amp; McLeod in the United States, but the company went out of business in 1971. Since then production has passed to several American builders, including the Clark Boat Company, W. D. Schock Corp, Northwest One Design and the current builder since 1975, Great Midwest Yacht Company. More than 4,000 boats of this design have been completed.

W. D. Schock Corp records indicate that they built 250 boats between 1959 and 1975.

==Design==
The Thistle is a recreational sailboat, with the earlier production models made from molded plywood and the more recent models built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood structural members and trim. The seats are a fiberglass-sandwich construction, and provide built-in flotation. It has a fractional sloop rig with aluminum spars and three spreader bars. The hull has no decks, a plumb stem and transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable, drum-mounted centerboard. It displaces .

The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer.

For sailing the design is equipped with symmetrical spinnaker of and built-in flotation.

The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 83.0 and is normally raced with a crew of three sailors, although it has a capacity of six people.

==Operational history==
By 1994 the design was being raced in more than 150 fleets.

In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, &quot;the Thistle was influenced by English dinghy design and is similar to the International 14, another racing dinghy with a plumb bow and flat run. Originally, boats were of molded wood. Racing crew is three, but the Thistle will carry six. She will fit into a garage. The Thistle has a lot of sail and a lot of speed. Class rules are strict. Gear that may be technically legal but provides an advantage is not allowed ... The Thistle is the boat used as the primary yardstick for Portsmouth Numbers.&quot;

<text>Monte Isola (also known by the name of the main island Montisola; Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune &quot;in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

It is located on the islands Montisola (the major island, from which it takes the name), Loreto and San Paolo in Lake Iseo and, , its population is 1,770. Monte Isola&#x27;s population is approximately spread over eleven villages and hamlets. There are several churches built between the 15th and the 17th century with frescoes, statues, altars in vernacular art.

==Geography==
The municipality covers a total area of ; the main island, Monte Isola, with an area of ranks as the largest lake island not only in Italy, but also in South and Central Europe, but is dwarfed by the large lake islands in Northern Europe. The peak of the island at above sea level is above the average surface elevation of Lake Iseo (), making Monte Isola one of the highest lake islands in Europe.

Monte Isola includes 12 &quot;frazioni&quot;: Carzano, Cure, Masse, Menzino, Novale, Olzano, Peschiera Maraglio, Porto di Siviano, Sensole, Senzano, Sinchignano and Siviano.

The bordering municipalities are Iseo, Marone, Sale Marasino, Sulzano, Parzanica, Tavernola Bergamasca and Sarnico.

There are two main ports Carzano and Peschieria with a frequent ferry service with the surrounding mainland villages, including Iseo.

==History==
There are indications of a Roman settlement. The first written document mentioning &quot;Insulae curtis&quot; dates from 905, when the island was listed among the properties of the monastery of S. Salvatore in Brescia. The family Oldofredi, rulers of Iseo, built on the island two strongholds in the 11th-12th centuries. Members of the powerful Visconti family came here to hunt in 1400. In 1497 Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan, gave the islanders some fishing rights and reduced the taxes. In the same year, Caterina Cornaro, queen of Cyprus, resided a while on the island. During the 19th century the main industry on the island was the construction of boats and the manufacturing of fishing nets.

Peschiera Maraglio and Siviano (the municipal seat) merged in 1929 to create the actual &quot;comune&quot;.

In June and early July, 2016, Monte Isola was the site of The Floating Piers by artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

==Main sights==
The single-nave church of San Michele in Peschiera Maraglio was consecrated in 1648. This baroque church is notable for the many frescoes on the walls and on the ceiling and for its wooden carvings.

The shrine of Madonna della Ceriola stands above sea level, the highest spot on the island. It can only be reached by walking from the small village of Cure.

The fortress Martinengo can be reached from Menzino. It was built in the 15th century by the Oldofredi family and enlarged in the 16th century by Martinengo. After a long period of neglect, it has been renovated in an elegant residence by the architect Vittorio Faglia. In 1497 Catherine Cornaro, queen of Cyprus, sojourned here for a short stay.

==Transportation==
Monte Isola can be reached through a network of ferry connection with regular schedules.

Driving restrictions are currently enforced, with mopeds and bicycles only allowed on the island. An extensive grid of dedicated bike lanes and hiking trails span all over the island, reaching the peaceful fishing villages with lakeside cafés and the Madonna della Ceriola chapel, nested near the summit of the island. A circular trail of almost allows a complete tour of Monte Isola.

A regular bus service, with special buses, is operated by the municipality of Monte Isola.

<doc id="1087546" wikidata="Q1195481" url="?curid=1087546" title="Man from Atlantis">
<text>Man from Atlantis is an American superhero television series that ran on the NBC network from 1977–78. It initially began as four TV movies that had aired in Spring 1977. The movies achieved high ratings which led to the commissioning of a weekly series for the 1977–78 season, but it was cancelled after 13 episodes due to a declining audience and high production costs.

== Series description ==
The series stars Patrick Duffy as an amnesiac man given the name of Mark Harris, believed to be the only surviving citizen of the lost civilization of Atlantis. He possesses exceptional abilities, including the ability to breathe underwater and withstand extreme depth pressures, and superhuman strength. His hands and feet are webbed, his eyes are unusually sensitive to light, and he swims using his arms and legs in a fashion suggestive of an underwater butterfly stroke or dolphin kick. Following his discovery, he is recruited by the Foundation for Oceanic Research, a governmental agency that conducts top secret research and explores the depths of the ocean in a sophisticated submarine, the &quot;Cetacean&quot;.

The supporting cast includes Belinda J. Montgomery as Dr. Elizabeth Merrill (who had nursed Mark Harris back to health) and Alan Fudge as C. W. Crawford, Jr., both of the Foundation for Oceanic Research. Victor Buono played the villainous Mr. Schubert in the pilot and several episodes of the series. Kenneth Tigar appeared in the second, third, and fourth movies as Dr Miller Simon, also of the Foundation for Oceanic Research, and Fred Beir appeared in the third and fourth films as Captain Bracy, commanding officer of the &quot;Cetacean&quot;. Tigar and Beir did not appear in the weekly series, and the &quot;Cetacean&quot; now inexplicably seemed to be under the command of Mark himself despite the fact he was not a naval officer. The series added an ensemble cast as &quot;The Crew of the &quot;Cetacean&quot;&quot;, variably consisting of Richard Laurance Williams, J. Victor Lopez, Jean Marie Hon, Anson Downes, Penelope Willis and Brandyn Artise. The tone of the weekly series shifted away from the relatively serious science fiction tone of the TV movies and further into escapist fantasy, not too dissimilar to &quot;Star Trek&quot; with Mark as the adventurer captain of the &quot;Cetacean&quot; like Captain Kirk was of the &quot;USS Enterprise&quot; (&quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; producer and co-creator Herbert Solow was one of the people responsible for bringing &quot;Star Trek&quot; to the screen in the 1960s). In several episodes, Mark would swim through portals in the ocean that led to other places and even other times. In one episode, he crossed into a world set in the 19th century wild west, in another he entered a world inhabited by aliens, and he even travelled into 16th century Italy where he meets the fictional characters of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. No explanation was given to how these worlds existed via the ocean. As the scripts became increasingly &quot;sillier&quot; (Duffy himself later likened the series to the campy 60&#x27;s TV series &quot;Batman&quot;), Montgomery&#x27;s scientist character became more sidelined and the actress managed to get out of her contract with the help of lawyers after 11 episodes. 
In the 12th episode, a new female lead character, Dr. Jenny Reynolds (played by Lisa Blake Richards) briefly replaced Elizabeth Merrill. However, the last episode did not feature any female lead character. Producer Herbert Solow also cast his then-wife Pamela Peters Solow, who was twenty years his junior, in the show twice. She first appeared in the fourth TV movie &quot;The Disappearances&quot;, and then again (as a different character) in the ninth episode of the series, &quot;C.W. Hyde&quot;. On both occasions she was given the prestigious screen billing of &quot;and Pamela Peters Solow as...&quot; despite being a relative unknown.

==Production==

The show was produced by Herbert Franklin Solow&#x27;s studio Solow Production Company, a company spun off from the live-action arm of American animation studio Hanna-Barbera Productions. The Foundation for Oceanic Research headquarters building was represented by the Point Fermin lighthouse in San Pedro, California. The &quot;Cetacean&quot; submarine&#x27;s voyages were shown through miniature work by the special effects team of Gene Warren.

==Critical reaction==
Critic Tom Shales, reviewing the show for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, opined that &quot;kids may be impressed&quot; by the heroics and special effects, but the show lacked &quot;adult appeal&quot; and that the stories would &quot;soon wear thinner than water&quot;.

==Home media==
The pilot film was released on VHS in 1986 by Worldvision Home Video, and re-released in 1987 by Goodtimes Home Video. It was later released on DVD as a part of the Warner Archive collection from Warner Home Video on October 6, 2009. On July 26, 2011, Warner Bros. released &quot;Man from Atlantis: The Complete TV Movies Collection&quot;, featuring all four television films, as well as &quot;Man from Atlantis—The Complete Television Series&quot; for Region 1 DVD. The pilot film was released on Blu-ray by Warner Archive Collection on March 12, 2019.

==International releases==
&quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; was the first American television series to be shown in the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1980, with the title translated to &quot;The Man from the Bottom of the Atlantic&quot;. It was at the time when the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; lost power to Deng Xiaoping, and science research began to get attention, along with economic development. The impact of the series in China was so high that, around the time it started airing, the start time of a concert of a foreign pianist had to be changed. The series aired on Saturday nights; its novelty came at a time when much of television in China was dominated by propaganda.

In Brazil it was named &quot;O Homem do Fundo do Mar&quot; (&quot;The Man from the Bottom of the Sea&quot; in Portuguese). In Portugal, the title was a direct translation of the original, &quot;O Homem da Atlântida&quot;, being screened on RTP1 in 1981. In Kuwait, it was released in the early 1980s in English with Arabic subtitles. In the Netherlands, the series was broadcast by TROS broadcasting association, from June 15, 1978 until September 5, 1980. In Germany, the series was broadcast by ARD from 1982 to 1983 and in 1988 by RTL plus with the title translated to &quot;Der Mann aus Atlantis&quot;. The show preserved its name in France as well, where it aired as &quot;L&#x27;Homme de l&#x27;Atlantide&quot;. In Turkey, the series also preserved its name and was broadcast as &quot;Atlantis&#x27;ten Gelen Adam&quot;. It was also shown on SABC in South Africa in 1979, with the original title.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; was shown, in most regions, in an early Saturday evening slot on ITV starting 24 September 1977. After airing the four television movies, the series was shown at an earlier time from 5 November 1977, opposite the BBC&#x27;s long-running sci-fi series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was then in its 15th season. Although &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; had not been a ratings/audience-share or demographic success in the US, the series actually beat &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during its transmission in the UK (this happened again in 1980–81 when ITV screened &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; against &quot;Doctor Who&quot;). In Italy, the series was one of the early successes of the then interregional network Telemilano, future Canale 5, that began to air the series on February 11, 1980 under the name &quot;L&#x27;Uomo di Atlantide&quot;. The first TV-film, &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot;, was released on video in Norway in the 1980s. In Israel, &quot;HaIsh MeAtlantis&quot; (a literal translation of the English title) was shown on Channel 1, the only channel in Israel at that time.

==Adaptations==
In 1977, Dell Publishing published a novelization titled &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; #1, written by Richard Woodley, which was followed by &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; #2: &quot;Death Scouts&quot; from the same author. The line continued unnumbered with &quot;Killer Spores&quot; (1977) and &quot;Ark of Doom&quot; (1978), also by Woodley, the latter being the retitled novelization of &quot;The Disappearances&quot;. In 1978, Marvel Comics published seven issues of a &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; comic book, written by Bill Mantlo with art by Frank Robbins and Frank Springer. At the same time as &quot;Marvel&quot;, the British children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Look-In&quot; began publishing a comic strip; this one was drawn by Mike Noble (and later John Cooper for one story). It was short-lived, lasting less than a year before being replaced with Enid Blyton&#x27;s &quot;Famous Five&quot;. Kenner Toys began development on a &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; line of action figures and toy vehicles in 1977, but it never proceeded past the prototype stage, while Denys Fisher Toys passed on making &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures for the UK as they thought the &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; would be more successful.

Series star Patrick Duffy wrote a sequel novel, titled simply &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot;, which was published in June 2016. The blog &quot;space1970&quot;, which reported on this novel, described it thus:

<doc id="1087547" wikidata="Q656261" url="?curid=1087547" title="Dialysis catheter">
<text>A dialysis catheter is a catheter used for exchanging blood to and from a hemodialysis machine and a patient.

The dialysis catheter contains two lumens: venous and arterial. Although both lumens are in the vein, the &quot;arterial&quot; lumen, like natural arteries, carries blood away from the heart, while the &quot;venous&quot; lumen returns blood towards the heart. The arterial lumen (typically red) withdraws blood from the patient and carries it to the dialysis machine, while the venous lumen (typically blue) returns blood to the patient (from the dialysis machine). Flow rates of dialysis catheters range between 200 and 500 ml/min.

If a patient requires long-term dialysis therapy, a chronic dialysis catheter will be inserted. Chronic catheters contain a dacron cuff that is tunneled beneath the skin approximately 3–8 cm. The tunnel is thought to add a barrier to infection. The most popular dialysis catheter sold on the market today is the Symmetrical-Tip dialysis catheter. This catheter is in the form spiral Z shape.
== Types ==
=== Temporary access ===
Central venous catheters intended for temporary access (sin. Quinton catheters) are typically used for less than 21 days. These types of catheters are usually smaller in size, placed directly in the vein, and are two or three lumens in design. The third lumen is useful for administration of fluids, antibiotics, medicines, or contrast without having to find other places for intravenous access. This type of catheter is useful for initiating venous access for acute renal failure patients quickly for dialysis before a permanent catheter is inserted for long term access.

=== Permanent access ===
The lumens of this type of catheter is larger, have a cuff that tunnel under the skin away from the venous insertion site with only two lumens. The catheter course under the skin helps to prevent infection going into bloodstream, as seen in temporary catheters.

== Catheter placement ==
Common site of catheter placement is placed by puncturing the right internal jugular vein (IJV) in the neck, advancing into superior vena cava (SVC) towards the right atrium of the heart due to its straightforward path into the SVC. Alternatively, a SVC catheter can be inserted via the right external jugular vein (EJV) if right IJV is inaccessible. If both IJV and EJV are both not accessible, left IJV can be assessed. However, left IJV access is more difficult that right IJV because of its tortuous course to the SVC.

== Complications ==
Some common malfunctions of dialysis catheters include clotting, infection, and kinking. One of the most common errors of tunnel hemodialysis catheter insertions is failure to locate the arterial limb of the catheter medially and the venous limb laterally. This must be done, because most catheters have a memory in the plastic, which will cause the catheter to try to resume its natural straight form. If the arterial limb is placed laterally, this will cause the arterial inlet to float up against the vein wall, or even up against the rim of the inlet of the atrium. This has the same effect as a vacuum cleaner hose sucking up against curtains. This results in poor blood flows, and can force the dialysis staff to reverse flow, using the venous limb of the catheter as the arterial. This will result in more inefficient dialysis, as there will be admixing of blood from the catheter (cleaning the same blood, over again). A dialysis catheter must have infusion of 30cc or greater to keep the line open. Intravenous fluids at 30ml per hour should be hung if being used for infusion.

== Fistulas versus catheters ==
Surgically created arteriovenous fistulae are preferred over catheters for patients with chronic kidney failure, as the risk of infections (e.g., endocarditis, bacteremia), hospitalization and death are lower.

<text>A bamboo floor is a type of flooring manufactured from the bamboo plant. The majority of today&#x27;s bamboo flooring products originate in China and other portions of Asia. Moso bamboo is the species most commonly used for flooring.

== Characteristics ==
Bamboo has been used as an alternative for flooring because of its physical similarities to true hardwoods. Bamboo floor manufacturers and sellers promote its strength, durability, its eco-friendliness and its natural resistance to insects and moisture. The hardness of traditional bamboo flooring ranges from 1180 (carbonized horizontal) to around 1380 (natural), while newer manufacturing techniques including strand woven bamboo flooring range from 3000 to over 5000 using the Janka hardness test. Other flooring materials have comparable Janka ratings, with a higher number indicating a harder material: red oak (1290); white oak (1360); rock maple (1450); hickory (1820); and Brazilian Cherry / Jatoba (2350).

== Manufacture ==
Different forms of bamboo flooring exist. Each varies in its manufacturing process and differs largely based on economic viability and local preferences.

The most common form, particularly in southeast Asia, uses thin bamboo stems that are cut as flat as possible. They are cut to similar lengths and can be stained, varnished, or simply used as is. They are then nailed down to wooden beams or bigger pieces of bamboo stems. This form results in more space between each bamboo stem; flatness and tightness is not emphasized. This technique is usually used on stilted houses, resulting in better air circulation especially during the warmer summer months.

The manufactured bamboo flooring commonly found in North American markets is very highly processed. A Bamboo flooring is typically made by slicing mature bamboo poles or culms into strips. These culms are crosscut to length and then sliced into strips depending on the width desired. The outer skin and nodes are removed. To remove starch and sugars the strips of bamboo are boiled in a solution of boric acid or lime. The bamboo is then dried and planed. Natural bamboo color is similar to beech wood. If a darker color similar to oak is desired, the bamboo goes through a carbonizing process of steaming under controlled pressure and heat. The carbonizing process can reduce the floor&#x27;s final hardness significantly compared to non-carbonized bamboo, rendering it softer than some pines and softer than more common red oak.

Most bamboo flooring uses a urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesive in the lamination process. Though the use of UF resins, which emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is harmful to indoor air quality, bamboo flooring uses a relatively small amount compared with other materials, such as particleboards. Bamboo flooring products that avoid formaldehyde use are available, including some listed in the GreenSpec Directory. The panels are then heat pressed to cure the adhesive. The cured boards are then planed, sanded, and milled. Finally an ultraviolet curing lacquer is applied to the boards.

Manufactured bamboo floors are typically made available in planks with either vertical- or horizontal-grain orientation. In vertical bamboo floors, the component pieces are stood vertically on their narrowest edge and then press laminated side to side. The effect is a lined, almost uniform look to the surface of the finished floor plank. In horizontal bamboo floors, the slats are arranged in a horizontal direction, on their widest edge, and then joined side by side with adjacent pieces using a high-pressure laminate system. The characteristic nodes of the bamboo are visible on the finished horizontal surface.

Locking bamboo flooring is the easiest to install. Individual flooring planks have interlocking joints that click precisely into place. By combining plank alignment and color a lot of different styles can be produced.

Strand woven bamboo flooring can be refinished with a clear-coat quite easily, however applying a stain on-site can be challenging.

== Environmental impact ==

Bamboo is an eco-friendly, highly renewable source of material. As a grass, bamboo grows much faster than wood. Moso Bamboo is the primary species used for the manufacturing of flooring and plywood. Moso bamboo can grow up to in 24 hours and high in 40 to 50 days. It takes about 3–5 years for bamboo to reach full maturity. Traditional hard woods can take 20–120 years to mature.

Bamboo can be harvested without the need to replant because the root system is left intact when it is harvested. The rhizome root structure has the ability to hold the soil in place preventing erosion. Rhizome root structures are horizontal stems that grow below the surface and help a plant reproduce vegetatively. Plants with rhizomes will colonize or spread laterally. In the United States of America, The Lacey Act recently strengthened the accountability in the sourcing of timber products. However enforcement is still in question.

Bamboo reaches maturity in five years which is the optimal age to harvest. In a sustainably harvested forest only 20% of the forest is harvested annually allowing for 100% harvest in a five-year period. In its natural environment it will need no irrigation, no pesticides, and no fertilizer. Bamboo has few pests so pesticides are not required. Bamboo certified to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) meets criteria for environmental sustainability and social responsibility, and several flooring products are available with this option. Bamboo can sequester up to 70% more carbon per year than a hardwood forest. All these factors keep the carbon footprint low.

The United States Green Building Council&#x27;s LEED program allows points for the use of bamboo floors by virtue of it being a rapidly renewable resource.

Since the majority of bamboo timber comes from China, it has to be shipped to the international destinations by boat and then by truck to vendors. A study which compared the embodied energy (including transportation) of bamboo flooring from Hunan Province, China to Denver, Colorado favored locally sourced concrete above bamboo flooring due to the additional carbon costs associated with transport.

Controversy exists over agricultural and manufacturing issues related to the production of bamboo floors, including the environmental effects of deforestation in order to plant bamboo and the use of carcinogenic chemicals such as urea-formaldehyde in the glues used for lamination in some products.

Bamboo flooring has led to deforestation, as existing trees are cut down to be replaced with bamboo plantations; this results in soil erosion in the often hilly and mountainous areas occupied by forestland, along with a loss of biodiversity in the region as other flora and fauna are cleared for bamboo. Additionally, the use of pesticides, weed killers and fertilizers in bamboo production can have an effect on the environment.

During the manufacturing of bamboo floors, some manufacturers use urea-formaldehyde as the adhesive for bonding the bamboo strips. According to the stringent California Air Resources Board (CARB) standards there can be no more than 0.05 ppm (parts per million) of outgassed formaldehyde. According to the USGBC&#x27;s LEED standard products with Urea-formaldehyde do not qualify for the EQ 4.4 Low-Emitting Products category. Manufacturers are now offering formaldehyde-free bamboo flooring, but they can claim that they have &quot;no added urea-formaldehyde&quot; without providing substantial proof. Manufacturers may make use of equipment that may in itself be dangerous and polluting. Some manufacturers may require their products to be registered under International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 9001 for quality control and 14001 for environmental management systems EMS, although these standards are not necessarily very high.

== Maintenance ==
Like most hardwood floors, bamboo floors should be treated carefully. When mopping, it is best to use a dust mop to remove the dust and grime. A stiff bristled broom can be used to remove more stubborn dirt from the crevices of the floor. Wet mops should be avoided on the bamboo flooring. When it is necessary to mop the floor, wring the mop out thoroughly to prevent any extra water from being released onto the floor. Cleaning detergents should be checked to make sure that they are safe for hard wood floors before they are added to the mop water. Many detergents contain a waxing agent which will dull the color of the flooring and leave behind a filmy glaze.

<text>Dudley Michael Hargrove (born October 26, 1949) is an American former Major League Baseball first baseman and manager. He is currently employed as an advisor with the Cleveland Guardians. Hargrove batted and threw left-handed. He played for the Texas Rangers (1974–78), San Diego Padres (1979), and Cleveland Indians (1979–85). After retiring, he went on to manage the Indians, Baltimore Orioles, and Seattle Mariners.

==Playing career==
During his 12-year playing career, Hargrove batted .290 with 80 home runs and 686 runs batted in. He won both the AL Rookie of the Year and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year awards in 1974, after hitting a career-high .323 with the Rangers (he was the first Ranger ever to be so honored). Afterwards, he made the AL All-Star squad in 1975 and led the league first basemen in assists twice. He was most effective in getting on base, moving runners, and not giving up an easy out—unusual for a first baseman which is usually considered a power position.

Though he would later be honored as one of the Cleveland Indians&#x27; top 100 players in team history, one of Hargrove&#x27;s early visits to Cleveland was less than memorable. As a rookie with the Rangers, Hargrove was one of the early targets of Cleveland fans during the infamous Ten Cent Beer Night incident on June 4, 1974.

Hargrove also attained the nickname &quot;The Human Rain Delay&quot; for his deliberate routine at the plate before each at-bat and before each pitch. He irritated pitchers by stepping out of the batter&#x27;s box after each pitch and starting his routine, which consisted of (1) adjusting his helmet, (2) adjusting his batting glove, making sure it was tight on his hand and especially the thumb, (3) pulling each sleeve on his uniform up about an inch, and (4) wiping each hand on his uniform pants – and then sometimes repeating the whole process again – before finally settling back into the box. Towards the end of his career this trait was very well known and often commented upon by broadcasters. Adding further to his &quot;Human Rain Delay&quot; moniker was his extremely fine bat control, which allowed him to foul off pitches.

Through June 16, 2009, Hargrove was tied for second of all Rangers players ever in career leadoff home runs, one behind the 9 by Ian Kinsler.

==Managing career==
===Cleveland Indians===
Hargrove worked as first base coach for Cleveland before being promoted to manager in 1991 to replace John McNamara, who was fired 77 games into the season. The Indians finished with 105 losses, most in team history while finishing in last place in the division. For the rest of Hargrove&#x27;s tenure, they would finish above last place. The next two Cleveland teams finished with 76 wins each, but the talent would rise to cultivation soon enough. The 1994 team was 66–47 and fighting for a potential playoff spot before the August strike killed the season.

He led his team to five consecutive AL Central Division titles in 1995–99 (being the first and so far only Cleveland manager to reach the postseason in five straight years), and World Series appearances in and .

The 1995 Indians won 100 games in the 144 game season (shortened due to the late start by the 1994 strike), becoming the first American League team to win 100 games in fewer than 154 games, comprised by a confident team led by Albert Belle (2nd in MVP voting) Jose Mesa (1.13 ERA), Kenny Lofton (54 stolen bases), Manny Ramirez (.308), Jim Thome, among others. They made their first playoff appearance since 1954. They won the 1995 American League Division Series in a three game sweep of the Boston Red Sox for their first postseason series victory since 1948 and then won the 1995 American League Championship Series over the Seattle Mariners for their first pennant since 1954. They played the Atlanta Braves in the 1995 World Series and lost in six games, as a team that hit .291 in the regular season hit .179 in the Series against Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine. The 1996 team won 99 games, making it the first time Cleveland had back-to-back 90-win seasons since the 1950-1955 seasons. Despite having eleven more wins than the Wild Card Baltimore Orioles, they lost in four games in the 1996 American League Division Series.

The 1997 team won 86 games, which was good enough to win the AL Central. They beat the defending world champion New York Yankees in a tight five game series before facing the Orioles, who had the best record in the AL. The series was a tight affair that saw five games be decided by one run (the biggest margin was three, in Game 1) while Cleveland won two of the games in extra innings. They won the series in six games despite being outscored 19–18. In the 1997 World Series, they faced the Florida Marlins, a team in their fifth season of play. The Indians won Games 2, 4, and 6 and were two outs from winning the Series in Game 7 before José Mesa allowed the tying run to score in the 9th inning. Charles Nagy would give up the winning run in the 11th, as Cleveland lost the series despite outscoring the Marlins 44-37.

On June 20, 1998, Hargrove, who had been wearing #21 to that point, switched to #30 to accommodate the Indians retiring #21 in honor of Bob Lemon. In the 1998 American League Championship Series, the Indians led the series by winning two of the first three against the New York Yankees. However, they were outscored by a margin of 18-8 in the next three games to lose the series, which was the last ALCS appearance for Cleveland until 2007.

A managing error by Hargrove on July 22, 1999, led to the first Indians pitcher to bat in an American League park since 1977, as Manny Ramirez was penciled in at the designated hitter position while Alex Ramirez was listed at right field, but somehow Manny entered the game at right field, thereby nullifying the DH when the opposing manager noticed. Charles Nagy had to bat and pitch at the DH spot (7th) in the eventual loss. The Indians lost in the 1999 American League Division Series after winning the first two games over Boston (in their third matchup in the last five years), as their starting pitching faltered, seeing their Game 3 starter leave after four innings and their Game 4 starter have to start on three days rest. In Game 4, Cleveland lost 23–7 and then lost 12–8 in Game 5 in Cleveland. He was fired on October 15, 1999, by general manager John Hart despite being under contract for 2000 with an option for 2001. The decision was made not due to the collapse in the series but rather one done over internal discussions internally past week, citing a need for a new atmosphere. Hargrove felt that the team lacked a true ace in pitching, while Hart felt that the team they had assembled on budget was a quality one; private sources felt Hargrove had lost the clubhouse, and he admitted that he may have been thought of as a distant manager. He was the longest tenured Indian manager since Lou Boudreau (1942–1950), and his 721–591 record was second best in club history.

===Baltimore Orioles===
On November 3, 1999, the Baltimore Orioles signed him to manage the club on a three-year contract. Hargrove was the second manager hired after the Orioles had fired Davey Johnson in 1997 (who Hargrove had faced in the 1996 ALDS and 1997 ALCS, winning the latter). He proved to be the second of seven managers that led Baltimore to a fifteen year drought from the postseason, with Hargrove finishing in fourth place in four seasons from 2000 to 2003. On October 29, 2003, he was let go by the Orioles.

During an exhibition series between players from the US and Japan, Hargrove infamously stated that future MLB All Star and Gold Glove fielder Ichiro Suzuki, whom he would later manage, would be easy to defend on grass.

===Seattle Mariners===
On October 20, 2004, Hargrove was hired to manage the Seattle Mariners and turn around the team after its worst season since 1983. He agreed to a three-year deal through the 2007 season.

On April 13, 2005, he won his 1,000th game as manager, leading the Mariners to a win over the Kansas City Royals. Despite having star Ichiro Suzuki, the Mariners lost 93 games that year and finished 4th. The next year saw marginal improvement but another 4th place finish. In 402 total games, Hargrove won 190 while losing 212 while becoming the second manager of an eventual nine Mariners manager carousel from 2002 to 2021 that failed to reach the postseason.

On July 1, 2007, Hargrove resigned his position as manager of the Mariners, saying in a prepared statement that his &quot;passion has begun to fade&quot; and it would not be &quot;fair to myself or the team&quot; to continue. The departure was unusual, since the Mariners had been playing quite well at the time. Hargrove became the first big league manager since at least 1900 to depart while on a winning streak of more than seven games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Sources indicated that differences between Hargrove and Mariners superstar Ichiro Suzuki were the actual reason for the departure. Despite officially having resigned, Hargrove was paid for the remainder of his contract, and Ichiro signed a contract extension only weeks after Hargrove left. Hargrove flatly stated that it was not a rift with Ichiro that caused him to leave, saying that it was his loss of passion for the position of manager that made him resign. He attempted to apply for the Indians job in 2009, but he did not get an interview.

Hargrove holds a career major league managerial record of 1,188–1,173.

==Post managing career==
From 2007 to 2009, Hargrove managed the Liberal BeeJays, a summer collegiate wood-bat team in southwest Kansas, whom he&#x27;d previously played for in 1972 while on the roster of Northwestern Oklahoma State University.

After taking the 2010 season off, Hargrove returned to Major League Baseball with the Indians in 2011 as a special advisor. His duties consist of assisting the coaching staff during spring training, and working in the front office during the regular season. He also worked a few games as a color analyst during select Indians TV games during the 2011 campaign.

<doc id="1087590" wikidata="Q2230505" url="?curid=1087590" title="Sound energy density">
<text>Sound energy density or sound density is the sound energy per unit volume. The SI unit of sound energy density is the pascal (Pa), which is 1 kg⋅m−1⋅s−2 in SI base units or 1 joule per cubic metre (J/m3).

==Mathematical definition==
Sound energy density, denoted &quot;w&quot;, is defined by
:formula_1
where
*&quot;p&quot; is the sound pressure;
*&quot;v&quot; is the particle velocity in the direction of propagation;
*&quot;c&quot; is the speed of sound.

The terms instantaneous energy density, maximum energy density, and peak energy density have meanings analogous to the related terms used for sound pressure. In speaking of average energy density, it is necessary to distinguish between the space average (at a given instant) and the time average (at a given point).

==Sound energy density level==
The sound energy density level gives the ratio of a sound incidence as a sound energy value in comparison to the reference level of 1 pPa (= 10−12 pascals). It is a logarithmic measure of the ratio of two sound energy densities. The unit of the sound energy density level is the decibel (dB), a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI Units.

The sound energy density level, &quot;L&quot;(&quot;E&quot;), for a given sound energy density, &quot;E&quot;1, in pascals, is 
:formula_2,

where &quot;E&quot;0 is the standard reference sound energy density

:formula_3 .

<doc id="1087591" wikidata="Q35025" url="?curid=1087591" title="Ancient South Arabian">
<text>Ancient South Arabian (ASA; also known as Old South Arabian, Epigraphic South Arabian, Ṣayhadic, or Yemenite) is a group of four closely related extinct languages (Sabaean/Sabaic, Qatabanic, Hadramitic, Minaic) spoken in the far southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula. The earliest preserved records belonging to the group are dated to the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE. They were written in the Ancient South Arabian script. Ancient South Arabian scripts are not considered varieties of Arabic. Instead, they represent an independent branch of Central Semitic.

There were a number of other Old South Arabian languages (e.g. Awsānian), of which very little evidence has survived, however. A pair of possible surviving Sayhadic languages is attested in the Razihi language and Faifi language spoken in far north-west of Yemen, though these varieties of speech have both Arabic and Sayhadic features, and it is difficult to classify them as either Arabic dialects with a Sayhadic substratum, or Sayhadic languages that have been restructured under pressure of Arabic.

== Classification issues ==
It was originally thought that all four members of this group were dialects of one Old South Arabian language, but in the mid-twentieth century, linguist A.F.L. Beeston finally proved that they did in fact constitute independent languages.

The Old South Arabian languages were originally classified (partly on the basis of geography) as South Semitic, along with Modern South Arabian and Ethiopian Semitic; more recently however, a new classification has come in use which places Old South Arabian, along with Arabic, Ugaritic, Aramaic and Canaanite/Hebrew in a Central Semitic group; leaving Modern South Arabian and Ethiopic in a separate group. This new classification is based on Arabic, Old South Arabian and Northwest Semitic (Ugaritic, Aramaic and Canaanite) sharing an innovation in the verbal system, an imperfect taking the form *&quot;yVqtVl-u&quot; (the other groups have &quot;*yVqattVl&quot;); Nebes showed that Sabaean at least had the form &quot;yVqtVl&quot; in the imperfect.

Even though it has been now accepted that the four main languages be considered independent, they are clearly closely related linguistically and derive from a common ancestor because they share certain morphological innovations. One of the most important isoglosses retained in all four languages is the suffixed definite article &quot;-(h)n&quot;, another proposed common innovation being the formation of 1st and 2nd person perfect verbal forms with -k (which is also a feature of Yemeni Arabic attributable to a Sayhadic substrate).
There are however significant differences between the languages, so much so that Stein proposes a relationship between Sabaic and Aramaic, with a primary split setting it apart from the other Sayhadic languages on the basis of the h/s isogloss in the formation of the personal pronouns and the causative stem further positing a closer relationship between Minaic and Hadramitic with the Ethiopian Semitic and Modern South Arabian branches.

The four main Sayhadic languages were: Sabaean, Minaeic (or Madhabic), Qatabanic, and Hadramitic.

Sayhadic had its own writing system, the Ancient South Arabian Monumental Script, or &quot;Ms3nd&quot;, consisting of 29 graphemes concurrently used for proto-Geʿez in the Kingdom of Dʿmt, ultimately sharing a common origin with the other Semitic abjads, the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet. Inscriptions in another minuscule cursive script written on wooden sticks have also been discovered.

The last inscription of these languages has been dated to 554 CE, 60 years before the appearance of Islam.

== Languages ==
Old South Arabian comprised a number of languages; the following are those that have been preserved in writing (the dates follow the so-called long chronology). Besides these, at least Razihi may be a surviving Old South Arabian language.

* Sabaean: the language of the kingdom of Saba and later also of Ḥimyar; also documented in the Ethiopian kingdom of Da&#x27;amot; very well documented, ca. 6,000 Inscriptions
** Old Sabaean: 8th until 2nd century BC.
** Middle Sabaean: 1st century BC until the 4th century AD (the best documented language)
*** Ḥaramitic: the language of the area to the north of Ma&#x27;īn
*** Central Sabaean: the language of the inscriptions from the Sabaean heartland
*** South Sabaean: the language of the inscriptions from Radman and Ḥimyar
*** &quot;Pseudo-Sabaean&quot;: the literary language of Arabian tribes in Najrān, Haram and Qaryat al-Fāw
** Late Sabaean: 5th and 6th centuries AD.

* Minaean: (also called &quot;Madhabian&quot;): the language of the city states in al-Jawf − with the exception of Haram − especially the later sparsely populated state of Ma&#x27;in (recorded from the 8th until 2nd century BC). Inscriptions have also been found outside Ma&#x27;īn in the commercial colonies of Dedan and Madā&#x27;in Ṣāliḥ, in Egypt and also on Delos. (ca. 500 inscriptions)

* Qatabānian: the language of the kingdom of Qatabān, recorded from the 5th century BC until the 2nd century (barely 2,000 inscriptions)
** Awsānian: the language of the kingdom of Awsān, poorly recorded (ca. 25 inscriptions, 8th/ 1st century BC until about the 1st century AD). Indistinguishable from Qatabānian.
** Other varieties such as the language of the tribe of Radmān

* Hadramautic (or Ḥaḑramitic): the language of Ḥaḑramaut, with an additional inscription from the Greek island of Delos. 5th century BC until the 4th century AD, with ca. 1,000 inscriptions.

== Written records ==
Old South Arabian was written in the Old South Arabian script, a consonantal abjad deriving from the Phoenician alphabet. Compared with other parts of the ancient world, Palestine for instance, the number of surviving inscriptions is very high. Something in the region of 10,000 inscriptions exist. The Sabaean lexicon contains about 2,500 words.

=== Categories of written records ===
# Inscriptions in stone
## Votive inscriptions, which often preserve historical accounts of the events that led to the dedication
## Inscriptions on buildings: give the names of the person who commissioned the work and the historical circumstances among other things
## Laws and legislation
## Protocols and deeds
## Inscriptions written for atonement or repentance
## Graffiti on rocks
# Literary texts: if large numbers of any such texts ever existed, they have been almost completely lost
# Inscriptions on wooden cylinders (Old, Middle and Late Sabaean and Hadramite). There are about 840 texts published so far.
## Private texts
## Contracts and orders
# Inscriptions on everyday objects

The inscriptions on stone display a very formal and precise wording and expression, whereas the style of the wooden inscriptions written in the cursive script is much more informal.

== Phonology ==
== History of research and teaching ==
Although the inscriptions from ancient South Arabia were already known by the 18th century, it was Wilhelm Gesenius (1786–1842) and his student Emil Rödiger who finally undertook the deciphering of the script, actually independently of each other, in the years 1841/42. Then in the second half of the 19th century Joseph Halévy and Eduard Glaser brought hundreds of Old South Arabian inscriptions, possible tracings and copies back to Europe. On the basis of this large amount of material Fritz Hommel prepared a selection of texts in 1893 along with an attempt at a grammar. Later on the Sabaean expert Nikolaus Rhodokanakis made especially important steps towards understanding Old South Arabian. A completely new field of Old South Arabian script and texts has opened up since the 1970s with the discovery of wooden cylinders on which Sabaean has been written with a pen. The unknown script and numerous incomprehensible words present Sabaean studies with new problems, and to this day the wooden cylinders are not completely understood.

In the German-speaking world, Old South Arabian is taught in the framework of Semitic Studies, and no independent university chair has been dedicated to Old South Arabian (or Sabaean) Studies. Learning Old South Arabian at least furthers the student’s knowledge of the characteristics of Semitic by introducing him or her to a less well-preserved example of the group. Students normally begin to learn the grammar of Old South Arabian and then they finally read a few of the longer texts.

<text>Magnalia Christi Americana (roughly, &quot;The Glorious Works of Christ in America&quot;) is a book published in 1702 by the puritan minister Cotton Mather (1663–1728). Its title is in Latin, but its subtitle is in English: &quot;The Ecclesiastical History of New England from Its First Planting in 1620, until the Year of Our Lord 1698&quot;. It was generally written in English and printed in London &quot;for Thomas Parkhurst, at the Bible and Three Crowns, Cheapside.&quot;
==Contents==
It consists of seven &quot;books&quot; collected into two volumes, and it details the religious development of Massachusetts, and other nearby colonies in New England from 1620 to 1698. Notable parts of the book include Mather&#x27;s descriptions of the Salem witch trials, in which he criticizes some of the methods of the court and attempts to distance himself from the event; his account of the escape of Hannah Duston, one of the best known captivity narratives; his account of the captivity and ransom of Hannah Swarton; his complete &quot;catalogus&quot; of all the students who graduated from Harvard College, the story of the founding of Harvard College itself; and his assertions that Puritan slaveholders should do more to convert their slaves to Christianity.
==Publication history==
Mather&#x27;s first edition of the book was published in London in 1702. A second edition - the first published in the United States - was printed in 1820 in Hartford, Connecticut by Silas Andrus and Son, who also produced a third edition in 1855. Robbins reprinted an edition in 1852 and 1967, which is the only complete reprinting of the first edition. A 1977 reprint of small selections, with extensive footnotes, was produced for Belknap Press by Kenneth Ballard Murdock.

<text>The Mayflower Hotel is a historic hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., located on Connecticut Avenue NW. It is two blocks north of Farragut Square and one block north of the Farragut North Metro station. The hotel is managed by Autograph Collection Hotels, a division of Marriott International.

The Mayflower is the largest luxury hotel in Washington, D.C., the longest continuously operating hotel in the Washington metropolitan area, and a rival of the nearby Willard InterContinental Washington and Hay–Adams Hotels.

The Mayflower has been called the &quot;Grande Dame of Washington&quot; and the &quot;Hotel of Presidents&quot;, President Harry S. Truman, a frequent guest of the hotel, called the Mayflower Hotel the city&#x27;s &quot;Second Best Address&quot; after the White House. It was also a charter member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It ranked a four-star hotel.

==History==
===Construction, sale, and renaming===

The site on which the Mayflower Hotel sits was, after the organization of the District of Columbia in 1792, initially owned by the federal government, which finally sold the property to Nathaniel Carusi for $5,089. Carusi, in tuirn, sold the site to the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary in 1867 for $50,000. The order built the Convent of the Visitation on the site, a structure that occupied the land until the construction of the Mayflower Hotel itself.

The Mayflower Hotel was built by Allan E. Walker, the land developer behind Brookland and other residential neighborhoods of Washington. Initially called the Hotel Walker, it was to have 11 stories, 1,100 rooms, and cost $6.2 million ($ in dollars). On May 27, 1922, the Walker Hotel Company was organized, with Allan Walker as president. The corporation issued 80,000 shares of preferred stock worth $2 million and 80,000 shares of common stock, and purchased a site on the north half of the block on DeSales Street between 17th Street and Connecticut Avenue. Plans for the hotel, whose cost was now pegged at $6.75 million ($ in dollars), now included an 11-story, 1,100-room hotel facing Connecticut Avenue, whose first two floors would be common rooms, and an eight-story residential hotel facing 17th Street. Robert F. Beresford of Washington, D.C., and the New York City architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore were appointed the architects, and Beresford said the structure would be built of concrete and brick around a steel frame. Indiana limestone would be used for the facade on the first three floors, with rusticated brick and terra cotta trim on all upper floors. By June 6, however, the cost of the hotel had risen to $8 million ($ in dollars), largely due to a sizeable expansion in the size of the ballrooms (the largest of which could now seat 1,600 people), meeting rooms, and other public spaces on the first two floors and first basement level.

Ground for the new hotel was broken in July 1922. Structural engineer F. E. Gillen designed the foundation, and oversaw its construction. As excavation began, workers quickly uncovered the stumps of massive cypress trees, some of the trunks nearly in diameter. Geologists estimated the stumps at 100,000 years old. As workers dug deeper, they discovered that an underground branch of Rock Creek ran below the site. This forced the foundation to be dug to bedrock, some below ground. The facade along Connecticut Avenue was in length, along DeSales Street in length, and along 17th Street in length. The main promenade running through the center of the hotel was wide and long, while the lobby was wide and long. Wainscoting and floors in the public rooms of the hotel were of Botticino marble and featured walnut moldings. A glass dome covered the Palm Court, which as decorated on the interior with ornamental ironwork in the Italianate style.

Excavation of the foundation was completed in late November 1922, several weeks ahead of schedule. Steel for the frame began arriving the week of January 21, 1923, and erection of the building&#x27;s frame was expected to take 10 weeks. More than 500 men worked on erecting the frame, while 2,000 men erected the facade and interior walls, and worked laying electrical, water, sewer, and gas lines. Longacre Engineering Company of New York was the general contractor. Construction costs continued to rise, however. Although scheduled to open January 1, 1924, the hotel remained unfinished. The Allan E. Walker Investment Company, the largest shareholder in the Hotel Walker Company began running short of funds, slowing construction. Nearing bankruptcy, the Walker Investment sold its interest in the Hotel Walker to C.C. Mitchell &amp; Company, builder of large apartment complexes and hotels in Boston and Detroit. The reported price of the sale was $5.7 million for the $8.5 million hotel. But in fact, costs had risen much higher, and the hotel&#x27;s final cost was closer to $11 million ($ in dollars). The new owners changed the name to the Mayflower Hotel in honor of the 300th anniversary of the landing of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; and the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock.

===About the hotel===

The Mayflower Hotel opened on February 18, 1925. The hotel sat on of land, and had roughly of interior space. Several heating oil furnaces and one of the world&#x27;s largest air conditioning units kept the hotel at an even year round. The hotel&#x27;s promenade, as completed, was wide and long.

The hotel had 440 guest rooms, each with its own shower bath. Guest suites had a sitting room, dining room, bath, and up to seven bedrooms. The hotel&#x27;s 500 residential guest apartments each had its own kitchenette, dining room, and drawing room with fireplace. Some had as many as 11 rooms, and up to five baths.

The cruciform lobby had a mezzanine on the north, west, and south sides, and marble-clad piers divided the north and south walls into three bays. A small cocktail lounge was located along the north wall, while the reception desk occupied the south wall. The lobby received light from a coffered skylight. Four great bronze torchères, hand-wrought and trimmed with gold, dominated the lobby (and were claimed by the hotel to be &quot;priceless&quot;). The main lobby entrance on Connecticut Avenue had a stairway that led down to the first below-ground level, where public restrooms, the barber shop, and a shoeshine stand (made of marble) were located. A secondary corridor and steps behind the elevators led to the Presidential Room; another secondary corridor to the east of the front desk led to the Mayflower Coffee Shop. The four elevators to the east of the lobby, joining it to the Promenade, had bronze doors with images of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; vessel on them.

The Mayflower featured three restaurants. The Palm Court featured a glass dome supported by iron latticework, numerous palm trees, and a marble fountain and pool with water lilies growing in it. The Presidential Restaurant was decorated with the seals of the Thirteen Colonies. Both were located on the main floor. The Garden Terrace was located on the first below-ground floor. The Italianate style room featured a coffered ceiling done in copper, a marble fountain, plaster walls in warm pastel tints, alcoves designed to look like arbors, and murals of early Washington, D.C., and nearby Mount Vernon. Two well-known hoteliers managed the restaurants: Jules Venice, the maitre d&#x27;hotel, and Sabatini, former chef at Delmonico&#x27;s.

The hotel&#x27;s Grand Ballroom featured a stage with proscenium, beneath which was a hidden thrust stage that could be projected out into the ballroom. The Grand Ballroom&#x27;s main entrance was on 17th Street, where a covered, semi-circular carriageway allowed up to three carriages at a time to unload patrons. The hotel also had several small, private ballrooms for more intimate events. Next to the ballroom on the 17th Street side was the Chinese Room—a sumptuous meeting and banqueting room inspired by &quot;The Peacock Room&quot; by James McNeill Whistler.

The Mayflower Hotel&#x27;s interior design was created by E. S. Bullock of Albert Pick &amp; Co. The furnishings, which cost $1.25 million ($ in dollars), were antique and reproduction pieces in the Sheraton, Louis Quinze, and early Renaissance styles. &quot;Walls, floors, stairs, pilasters and wainscoting in the lobby and the major function rooms [were] clad in a wide array of American and imported marbles, and ceilings and walls throughout the first floor and mezzanine [were] ornamented by finely cast, low-relief plaster decorations, often further embellished with gold leaf.&quot; The use of gold gilt to trim decoration was extensive; newspapers said the hotel contained more gold trim than any other building except the Library of Congress. Original artworks, some by quite famous artists, adorned the public spaces. These included four larger-than-life-sized portraits of the first four presidents by painter and muralist Louis Grell of Chicago. Three marble statuary groups were also displayed in the lobby and public areas: &quot;La Sirene&quot; by Denys Puech; &quot;Flora&quot; by William Couper; and &quot;The Lost Pleiad&quot; (also known as &quot;Merope Married a Mortal&quot;) by Randolph Rogers. Two smaller pieces by Rogers, &quot;Nydia, the Blind Girl of Pompeii&quot; and &quot;Boy and Dog&quot;, were also on display.

The Mayflower Hotel offered a wide range of amenities to its guests, including air conditioning in all public rooms (the first time a hotel had used air conditioning on such a large scale) and ice water and fans in all guest rooms. Services included daily maid service, a laundry, a barber shop, a beauty salon, a garage for automobiles, a telephone switchboard, and a small hospital staffed by a doctor.

===Construction of the Annex===

With the Mayflower Hotel finished but not yet furnished in September 1924, plans were made to enlarge the structure even before it opened. The new owners perceived high demand for guest room suites, and quickly designed a $1 million ($ in dollars) addition. Construction began in October 1925, and within six weeks the deep foundation had been dug. The addition opened on May 31, 1925.

The most prominent features of the Annex were the Presidential Suite and the Vice Presidential Suite. The Presidential Suite occupied the 10th floor, and was decorated in green and gold in the Italianate style. The Vice Presidential Suite occupied the ninth floor, and was decorated in dull and bright yellow in the Louis XVI style. Each suite had 13 rooms, which included a foyer, drawing room, library, secretary&#x27;s room, dining room, and five bedrooms—each with its own bath and kitchenette. Each suite also had a maid&#x27;s room, with an attached bath. The furnishings of both suites were copies of museum pieces. The Presidential Suite featured a marquetry table with ormolu fittings; a Louis XVI cabinet with painted panels; Oriental rugs; bronze and marble urns in the Neoclassical style; drapes of silk damask; and underdrapes of silk taffeta. The suite&#x27;s dining room featured Queen Anne style furniture. The Vice Presidential Suite featured a dining room with furniture in the Sheraton and Hepplewhite styles. Dining room furniture in both suites was manufactured from satin-walnut, and featured painted decorations and marquetry. The bedrooms in both suites featured Louis XVI-, Adam-, and Federal-style furniture made of satinwood, walnut, and mahogany. Each piece was painted, lacquered, or marquetried. Dust-covers for the beds were also of taffeta. Sofas and chairs in each suite were upholstered in imported brocades, while the walls were covered in hand-made tapestries. Each suite had numerous shaded lamps, porcelain and crystal art objects, and gilt mirrors. Original oil and watercolor paintings as well as etchings and engravings—many of them by famous artists—decorated the suites. Each suite&#x27;s bathroom was completely tiled in white, with silver-plated fixtures for the sink and shower, an engraved glass shower door, and a Swiss shower. The kitchens, too, were tiled in white, and contained an electric stove and oven, a Frigidaire refrigerator, silver tableware, complete porcelain table setting, and fine table linens.

The second through eighth floors of the Annex contained guest suites. Each suite had five bedrooms, and each bedroom had its own bath. The first floor of the Annex was occupied by the Mayflower Coffee Shop, a vastly expanded version of the highly popular but extremely small café located on the ground floor of the existing hotel. The basement of the Annex occupied by a huge laundry, which served the hotel and annex.

===Bankruptcy of the 1930s===
On March 31, 1928, the Mayflower Hotel&#x27;s bonds were refinanced by the American Bond &amp; Mortgage Co. (the successor to C.C. Mitchell &amp; Co.).

The Great Depression had a significant impact on the Mayflower Hotel. It lost money (as much as $760,000 over two years), and in 1929 its affairs were placed in the hands of a special committee established by American Bond &amp; Mortgage. The hotel continued to lose money, and on May 22, 1931, holders of the hotel&#x27;s original bonds secured a ruling that the hotel was bankrupt. American Bond was declared bankrupt the same day. The receivers later alleged that the hotel had lost more than $2 million since it opened, and that American Bond had issued a large amount of bonds with the hotel as security (worsening the hotel&#x27;s financial status). American Bond won dismissal of the bankruptcy ruling on June 26, A second bankruptcy was declared by the court on July 28, 1931. Fraud charges were later levied against officials of American Bond &amp; Mortgage. American Bond finally admitted the hotel was bankrupt in October 1931.

Holders of the second bonds (issued with the hotel as security), however, feared that they would receive nothing if the Mayflower were foreclosed. They petitioned a court to remove the receivers and to appoint new trustees who would sell the hotel. The court agreed, and the sale began to move forward in 1933. Concerned about the sale, Senators Hamilton Fish Kean and Robert Rice Reynolds began an investigation into the bankruptcy and sale. In 1933, Kean and Reynolds won congressional approval in June 1934 for the Corporate Bankruptcy Act, which allowed the Mayflower Hotel itself to declare bankruptcy and refinance itself. With the receivers having made the hotel profitable once more, the hotel reorganized its finances in a court-approval bankruptcy proceeding on December 20, 1934.

Early in World War II, the skylight in the Palm Court was covered over with a mural painting. The skylight was later flocked with pieces of velvet.

===Hilton===
In December 1946, Hilton Hotels Corporation purchased the Mayflower Hotel for $2.6 million. Some of the Mayflower&#x27;s stockholders challenged the sale, arguing the price was too low. A court dismissed the suit in May 1947. Over the next decade, Hilton Hotels spent about $1 million refurbishing the guest rooms and public spaces. Hilton Hotels purchased the Statler Hotels chain in 1954, and as a result owned multiple large hotels in many major cities, as in Washington, where they now owned the Mayflower and the Statler Hotel. Soon after, the federal government filed an antitrust action against Hilton. To resolve the suit, Hilton agreed to sell the Mayflower Hotel, the Roosevelt Hotel in New York and the Hotel Jefferson in St. Louis.

===Hotel Corporation of America===
Hilton Hotels sold the Mayflower to the Hotel Corporation of America (HCA) on April 1, 1956, for $12.8 million. HCA renovated the Mayflower&#x27;s old Garden Terrace, renaming it the Rib Room. The hotel&#x27;s occupancy rates were lower than average, however. In 1963, for example, the Mayflower lost $450,000. HCA privately expressed interest in selling the property.

===May-Wash Associates===
On October 28, 1965, the locally owned May-Wash Associates offered to buy the Mayflower for $14 million. May-Wash Associates consisted of William Cohen, a local real estate developer and banker who owned 50 percent of the company; Kingdon Gould Jr. and his son, Kingdon Gould III, local real estate developers who owned 35 percent; Ulysses &quot;Blackie&quot; Augur, a local restaurateur who owned 10 percent; and Dominic F. Antonelli, owner of a string of parking lots in the area who owned 1 percent. HCA&#x27;s board of directors approved the deal on November 11, 1965. HCA continued to manage the hotel for the new owners.

The Mayflower Hotel underwent a $2.5 million refurbishment of its common rooms in 1966 and 1967. The renovation got rid of the Presidential Restaurant and renamed it Le Chatelaine. HCA was renamed Sonesta Hotels in 1970.

May-Wash Associates considered closing the Mayflower Hotel in 1971 after it lost $485,000 the previous year. Lead May-Wash investor William Cohen said that if Congress weakened the restrictions of the Height of Buildings Act of 1910, the company would tear down the Mayflower and erect a 20-story office and retail skyscraper with of office space and of retail space. If the Height Act remained in force, Cohen said the hotel&#x27;s first two floors would be transformed into a shopping mall accommodating 40 to 50 small businesses. But the plan was abandoned later that fall when the Mayflower announced a five-year, $2.5 million renovation that would refurbish the retail stores on the Connecticut Avenue side of the structure. Then on November 1, 1971, May-Wash hired Western International Hotels to manage the property. Western International said it would invest $500,000 immediately to upgrade guest rooms (which included color television sets for the first time). Western International said the previously announced $2.5 million refurbishment would go to additional guest room renovations, and improvements to dining spaces, banqueting facilities, and ballrooms. The Rib Room lost its name (which had been trademarked by HCA, the previous manager), the facade was cleaned, and the air conditioning repaired and upgraded.

Beginning in April 1973, the Mayflower Hotel served as the temporary Embassy of China in Washington, D.C., for a time while their new embassy building at 2300 Connecticut Avenue NW was being renovated following the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

With the Mayflower making a profit, May-Wash Associates undertook at $2.5 million general refurbishment of the 800 guest rooms about 1977. The hotel then announced a $25 million overhaul and expansion in January 1979. The main western wing of the hotel, facing Connecticut Avenue, was to have the public rooms on the lower two levels turned into retail space, while the 448 guest rooms above would be gutted and transformed into office space. The eastern wing, in the rear, would remain a hotel. May-Wash hired architect Vlastimil Koubek to design two new floors to add to the top of the eastern wing, bringing it to the same height as the western wing. The resulting hotel would have 407 guest rooms, larger than those before, a mix of newly built rooms and remodeled existing rooms. The hotel also planned to add a health club (with racquetball court, sauna, and swimming pool) and café to the 17th Street side of the hotel. Meeting and private dining room space would be added to the structure; all plumbing and mechanical systems would be upgraded; and central air conditioning would replace the window units now in operation. The hotel sought to permanently narrow De Sales Street NW as part of its renovations.

Western International Hotels, which managed the property, was renamed Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts in January 1981. In October 1981, May-Wash Associates announced that Stouffer Corp., a division of Nestlé, was taking a minority interest in the Mayflower Hotel, and would assume management of the property on December 1, 1981, under a 20-year agreement. Stouffer said the hotel would be its American &quot;flagship&quot;, and the hotel was renamed the Stouffer Mayflower Hotel.

While renovation of the eastern tower proceeded, plans for the western tower drastically changed. The Mayflower abandoned its plan to convert the tower into office space, and instead upgraded the hotel rooms in the eastern tower. In some cases, rooms were merged to create luxury suites. The change in renovation plans left the Mayflower with just 727 rooms, but added of meeting room space and a new restaurant. The hotel still attempted to narrow DeSales Street NW, proposing to use the extra space to build an enclosed outdoor café (something city laws did not permit).

Even as the first renovations were ending, the Mayflower Hotel embarked on another major set of refurbishments and upgrades. This project, which began in 1981 and lasted three years, cost $65 million. The hotel remained open as the project moved forward in phases. In 1981, two floors were finally added to the eastern wing of the structure. The meeting rooms on the hotel&#x27;s second floor and the Board Room were refurbished, and offices on the mezzanine were removed and the space restored to public use. The following year, 200 suites received major makeovers, including the installation of baths clad in Italian marble. The Presidential Restaurant was divided into two new banqueting halls, the East Room and the State Room, and the Grand Ballroom and the Chinese Room were renovated. The restoration of the lobby and upgrading of the hotel&#x27;s restaurants occurred in 1983. Artisans and technicians helped to restore the bas-relief plaster moldings and brass fixtures, clean and restore the hotel&#x27;s many crystal chandeliers, and apply new gold leaf to areas where the gilt had been damaged or removed. The renovations left the hotel with 721 guest rooms (about half rebuilt and restored) and two restaurants.

The renovation uncovered many historic decorative elements which had been covered up over time. The skylight in the Presidential Room (formerly the Palm Court) was uncovered. When renovation of the former Palm Court began, two previously unknown murals by Edward Laning were discovered. The murals were dated by art experts to 1957, when the Palm Court was radically reconfigured into the Le Chatelaine restaurant. The murals, long and high, depicted Italian formal gardens. They were hidden behind a false wall when the restaurant was turned into meeting room space in early 1978. Discovered in storage were 24 fire-gilded 19th century service platters purchased from the estate of heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean in 1947.

===Stouffer, New World and Marriott Hotels===
After managing the hotel for ten years, Stouffer bought it outright from May-Wash in 1991 for just over $100 million. In April 1993, Stouffer Hotels was sold by Nestlé to New World Development Company of Hong Kong. Nestlé also gave New World the right to use the Stouffer brand name for 3 years, from 1993 to May 1996. New World already owned the Renaissance Hotels chain, and merged the Stouffer-branded Hotels into it. The Mayflower was renamed the Stouffer Renaissance Mayflower Hotel. In early 1996, the Stouffer branding was retired, and the hotel became the Renaissance Mayflower Hotel. Marriott International bought Renaissance Hotels from New World in February 1997.

===Investment groups===
Marriott sold The Mayflower to Walton Street Capital in 2005, in a package with seven other Marriott hotels, for a total of $578 million. Walton Street resold the Mayflower to Rockwood Capital in 2007 for $260 million, financed with a $200 million securitized loan.

The hotel, appraised at $285 million in 2008, fell in value to $160 million by 2010. With Rockwood&#x27;s loan over-leveraged, they refinanced the hotel in 2015, with a $160 million loan from Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance Inc. and other lenders. Also in 2015, Rockwood sold off 71 of the hotel&#x27;s rooms to Marriott for $32 million, for use by the company&#x27;s Marriott Vacation Club Destinations time-share division.

In May 2015, the hotel switched from Marriott&#x27;s Renaissance Hotels brand to Marriott&#x27;s Autograph Collection brand, dropping the word &quot;Renaissance&quot; from its name. The move was prompted by studies which showed that younger travelers were not brand-loyal and instead looked for individuality and uniqueness when shopping for a hotel stay. Marriott also learned that few travelers knew the Mayflower was a Renaissance Hotel, which made the branding superfluous.

A $20 million refurbishment of all rooms and the creation of a club level was completed in August 2015. Each floor of the hotel was given a theme corresponding to a decade, with the second floor devoted to the 1920s, third floor to the 1930s, and so on to the tenth floor. Each room received updated, modern furniture, and the hallways were wallpapered in grey and white with a pattern reminiscent of the lobby mezzanine railing. Each of the hotel&#x27;s presidential suites also received a complete makeover, and now have a separate office. Rooms on the seventh floor were eliminated to make space for the Marriott Vacation Club Pulse. This left the Mayflower with a total of 581 rooms (512 guest rooms, 67 suites, and two presidential suites). At the completion of the room renovation, the Mayflower announced it would begin a major refurbishment of the hotel&#x27;s ballrooms and meeting space in late 2016.

In July 2021, Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance Inc., having already provided Rockwood financing for the 2015 refinancing, bought out Rockwood&#x27;s share of the hotel, for $86 million.

==Renovations==

===Lobby===
In the hotel&#x27;s early years, the lobby skylight was painted over.

The lobby originally featured a small store and cocktail bar in its northwest corner. The main entrance to this space was at the corner where the two diagonal walls of the hotel met at the corner of Connecticut Avenue and DeSales Street. In March 1948, the retail area was taken over by the hotel and expanded into a much larger bar and dining space named the Town and Country Lounge. Over the next four decades, the bar became a favorite of Washington politicians and power-brokers. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London rated Town and Country as one of the &quot;star bars&quot; of the world (alongside the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California; the mob-constructed lobby bar of the Hotel Nacional de Cuba in Havana, Cuba; and Harry&#x27;s New York Bar in Paris, France).

The lobby mezzanine was closed off to create office space in 1962. The ceiling of the elevator foyer was lowered, which covered up a bas-relief plaster sculpture on the architrave above the east entrance to the elevator foyer and a sunburst medallion on the ceiling of the elevator foyer were both covered over (but not removed). Intricate plaster capitals on the piers in the lobby were also removed at this time. At some point, a door was cut through the curved wall opposite the elevator bank.

The offices were removed from the lobby mezzanine in the 1981–1984 renovation, and the mezzanine restored to its original function. The door in the curved wall opposite the elevators was also sealed.

The Town and Country Lounge was slightly renovated in 2010, with hardwood floors replacing the carpet. The bar&#x27;s future, however, was not secure. In January 2011, the hotel&#x27;s lobby, restaurant, bar, and retail spaces underwent a six-month, $5 million renovation (their first since the 1981–1984 refurbishment). The Town and Country Lounge ceased to exist, and the Thomas Pink luxury men&#x27;s clothing store moved into the space. Thomas Pink had formerly occupied the site of the old Mayflower Coffee Shop on the south side of the lobby. Offices near this space were removed to provide expansion of the space, and a new restaurant to be named EDGAR Bar + Lounge. The lobby itself underwent additional restoration, overseen by the architectural firm of Jonathan Nehmer &amp; Associates, which flipped the lobby orientation.

===Presidential Room===
The Presidential Room was originally decorated in the Adams style. The floor of the room was white Vermont marble tile. Thin diagonal lines of verd antique ran across the floor. Around the floor was an inner, narrow border of verd antique, with a wide border of blue-veined white Pavonazzo marble. Seven square piers, with Doric capitals and gilt festoons, created a narrow colonnade along the north and south walls. A wainscot high, made of white Sylacauga marble with a verd antique baseboard, was placed on the walls and around all the piers. An acanthus crown molding topped the room, and gilt plaster moldings in the shape of finials surrounded each window and doorway. Turned wood spindles decorated the northern wall. The crests of the 13 Colonies, in gilt and polychrome, lined the walls as decorative elements. On the south side of the room, there was a &quot;service pavilion&quot; wide and one story high. A narrow set of stairs gave access to the top of the service pavilion, which was enclosed by a decorative iron railing. The ceiling of the room was decoration with Adams style bas-relief plaster moldings. The center of the ceiling was a long rectangle stretching nearly the long length of the room, surrounded by gilt plaster wreath moldings. A gilt chandelier with silk shades hung from the center of the room. Shallow, circular domes surrounded by gilt plaster wreath moldings existed at the east and west ends of the room. In the center of each dome was a delicate grating, from which hung two more gilt chandeliers with silk shades.

At some point in time, the stairs leading to the top of the service pavilion were removed. The structure was clad in mirrors separated by narrow pilasters, and most (but not all) of the spindles removed from the north wall.

The old Presidential Room was partitioned in the 1981–1984 renovation, and two ballrooms/meeting rooms—the State Room and the East Room—were created out of the space. A removable metal partition was installed to divide the room as well as the service pavilion. Almost none of the other original decorations of the room have been changed since its 1925 creation, however.

===Palm Court===
The north wall of the Palm Court originally consisted of structural piers, leaving the room open to the Promenade. Pilasters along the south wall mimicked this look and gave the room an aesthetic symmetry. A bay in the east wall was framed by columns and an arch, and an oriel balcony on the mezzanine level projected into the room. The Palm Court had a floor of American travertine, a maple dance floor, wainscoting of gold-veined St. Genevieve marble, and intricate plaster moldings on entablature and ceiling.

Walls were added between the piers in 1934, and the Palm Court was internally partitioned in 1947. In 1950, arches were constructed between the piers of the north wall and the pilasters of the south wall in an attempt to connect the walls visually. In 1957, the Palm Court was radically renovated. Its Victorian ironwork was removed and a Neoclassical style decorating scheme implemented. Two large murals by painter Edward Laning were added, and framed with nonstructural columns in an attempt to simulate the vista from a verandah. The room&#x27;s eastern bay was sealed off, and small staging vestibules added to the south wall, leaving the room strongly asymmetrical.

During the 1981–1984 renovation, the east bay was reopened. The old Palm Court was now confusingly renamed the Presidential Room.

===The Promenade===
The Promenade originally featured pilasters that defined six bays along both its north and south sides. The capital of each pilaster was decorated with the profile of a different mythological hero, and festooned with swag. Each pilaster had a faux pedestal made of verd antique decorated with plaster rosettes and gilt plaster wreaths. The wainscoting was high, and of white Alabama marble. A baseboard of verd antique and a gray marble dado rail completed the wainscot, and a gilt plaster acanthus crown molding decorated the ceiling. Arches in the north wall gave access to meeting rooms. The arches leading to the Grand Ballroom, Chinese Room, and the original Presidential Room were topped with sculpted architraves of white Alabama marble, while the other arches were each topped by a gilt plaster crest. Beveled mirrors stood between the pilasters. The ceiling of the Promenade consisted of octagonal coffers alternating with small square coffers. At the center of each square coffer was a gilt plaster rosette. The floor was of white Vermont marble and verd antique marble, with a border of verd antique. Architect Shirley Maxwell has noted that the Mayflower&#x27;s &quot;block-long long lobby and promenade form what is probably the grandest indoor &#x27;street&#x27; in Washington...&quot;

At some point in time, the arches which led to the small meeting rooms along the north wall were filled in with gilt-edged mirrors.

===The Grand Ballroom===
The Grand Ballroom was the most opulent room in the Mayflower Hotel. As with the Presidential Room, square piers formed colonnades along the north and south walls. Ionic capitals featuring satanic faces topped each pier. A stage with a proscenium arch was located on the west end. Mirrored French Doors formed the Grand Ballroom&#x27;s east wall. These could be opened to provide access to the Chinese Room beyond. A small curved balcony, reached by narrow stairs in the northeast and southeast corners of the ballroom, projected over the French doors. The wainscoting was of tan St. Genevieve marble. Six doors pierced the north wall and led to the Promenade, with the end doors reached by curving steps. The floor consisted of a wooden floor with a border of marble. Delicate, bas-relief gilt plaster decorations covered the piers, walls, and ceiling.

===The Chinese Room===
The Chinese Room had a square floorplan. A flight of short steps led to the entrance, which was in the curved, north wall. Large, rectangular piers framed an alcove (which ran nearly the depth of the room) on the east. The hardwood floor featured a baseboard of verd antique, and a crown molding of gilt plaster acanthus leaves surrounds the ceiling. The ceiling of the Chinese Room consists of a dramatic elliptical dome. A gilt plaster molding of wreathes surrounds the dome, while the rest of the ceiling is covered in chinoiserie paintings of animals, people, and trees. A two-tiered crystal chandelier hung from the center of the dome.

At some point in time, the windows in the east wall were filled in, and mirrors inserted in the new, false casements.

===The District Ballroom===
The Garden Terrace (Originally Named), located on the first below-ground floor, featured Italianate decor, a coffered copper ceiling, a marble fountain, plaster walls in warm pastel tints, alcoves designed to look like arbors, and murals of early Washington, D.C., and nearby Mount Vernon.

The Garden Terrace was radically redecorated in September 1940, and its name changed to the Sapphire Room. Designed by Robert F. Beresford, one of the hotel&#x27;s original architects, the rear of the room&#x27;s stage was clad in glowing sapphire-blue glass brick. The overhead arches were clad in aluminum, most of the decoration in the room removed, and the remaining surfaces painted bright blue. Carpet with a brick-like pattern in blue covered the floor.

In about 1950, the Sapphire Room was redecorated in the Colonial Revival style, a popular at the time, and renamed the Williamsburg Room. It was open by at least October 1950. The alcoves were removed and replaced with a raised terrace on the north, east, and south sides of the room. A railing with an oak handrail and turned-wood balusters enclosed the gallery, and a shallow concave stage was added to the west wall. Pilasters, paneled in warm-colored wood, were added to the walls. A wainscot and dado rail of wood covered the lower part of the walls. A highly intricate plaster architrave and broken pediment surmounted the entrances to the terrace.

The Williamsburg Room became the Colonial Room about January 1971.

===Mayflower Coffee Shop===
The Mayflower Coffee Shop originally occupied a small space south and slightly west of the main desk and front office on the west side of the hotel. This space was quite small, but was vastly expanded in April 1925 with the completion of the Annex. A soda fountain and candy shop occupied the old coffee shop space, while the coffee shop expanded into a much larger space south of the lobby/front desk area. The coffee shop, which also served small meals and box lunches, was decorated with paintings of Colonial America and was intended to look like an old-fashioned coffee house.

In 1956, with the change in hotel management, the front desk was moved to the north side of the lobby (occupying space previously used for phone booths). The soda fountain and candy shop were eliminated, and the restaurant expanded to occupy the space. The restaurant was renamed the Rib Room. When Western International Hotels rook over from HCA, the restaurant lost its name (which was a trademark of HCA). The restaurant was subsequently named The Carvery in July 1972. The Carvery closed in 2004.

==Notable events==
The Mayflower Hotel hosted the Inaugural Ball of President Calvin Coolidge just two weeks after its opening. It hosted an Inaugural Ball every four years until it hosted its final ball in January 1981. It has not hosted an Inaugural Ball since. President-elect Herbert Hoover established his presidential planning team offices in the hotel in January 1928, and his Vice President, Charles Curtis, lived there in one of the hotel&#x27;s residential guest rooms during his four years in office. Senator Huey Long also lived at the Mayflower, taking eight suites in the hotel from January 25, 1932, to March 1934. President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt spent March 2 and 3 in Suites 776 and 781 at the Mayflower Hotel before his inauguration on March 4. United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and former Governor of North Carolina Oliver Max Gardner and his wife, Fay Webb-Gardner, lived at the hotel from 1946 to 1947.

Two events of significance during World War II happened at the Mayflower. In June 1942, George John Dasch and seven other spies from Nazi Germany entered the United States after being transported to American shores via a submarine. Their goal, named Operation Pastorius, was to engage in sabotage against key infrastructure. But after encountering a United States Coast Guard patrol moments after landing, Dasch decided the plan was useless. On June 19, 1942, he checked into Room 351 at the Mayflower Hotel and promptly betrayed his comrades. Eighteen months later, a committee of the American Legion met in Room 570 at the Mayflower Hotel from December 15 to 31, 1943, to draft legislation to assist returning military members reintegrate into society. Their proposed legislation, the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944—known informally as the G.I. Bill—was put into final draft from by Harry W. Colmery on Mayflower Hotel stationery.

Twice, the Mayflower has been the site where a U.S. presidential campaign was launched, and twice it hosted events which proved to be turning points in a presidential nomination. In March 1931, Franklin D. Roosevelt was vying with Al Smith for the Democratic presidential nomination of 1932. John J. Raskob, chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s candidacy. Knowing that Roosevelt had privately committed to repealing Prohibition but had not done so publicly (leaving him &quot;damp&quot;), Raskob attempted to force the DNC, then meeting at the Mayflower Hotel, to adopt a &quot;wet&quot; (or repeal) plank in the party platform. Instead of drawing Roosevelt out, the maneuver deeply offended Southern &quot;dry&quot; (anti-repeal) Democrats—who abandoned Smith and threw their support to the allegedly more moderate Roosevelt, and helped him secure the nomination. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman told a cheering audience of Young Democrats of America at a dinner at the Mayflower on May 14 that he intended to seek re-election in 1948. Former Peace Corps and Office of Economic Opportunity director Sargent Shriver announced his run for President of the United States at the Mayflower on September 20, 1975. Shriver withdrew from the race after a very poor showing, but a more successful campaign began there in 2008. Senator Barack Obama had locked down the 2008 Democratic nomination for President on June 3, 2008. Hillary Clinton conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7, and introduced Obama to about 300 of her leading contributors at a meeting at the Mayflower on June 26, 2008.

J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), lunched nearly every day at the Mayflower Hotel&#x27;s Rib Room with Clyde Tolson, associate director of the FBI, from 1952 until Hoover&#x27;s death in 1972. Hoover had the same lunch every day: chicken soup followed by a salad of iceberg lettuce, grapefruit, and cottage cheese. Buttered white toast was served on the side. (He brought his own diet salad dressing.) Hoover was so well known at the Rib Room that he sometimes ducked out through the kitchen to avoid reporters.

The front of the Mayflower was where &quot;The Washington Post&quot; national editor Ben Bagdikian transferred copied portions of the Pentagon Papers, an internal DoD study of the history of the Vietnam War given to him by Daniel Ellsberg, to U.S. Senator Mike Gravel, for reading into the congressional record, at midnight on June 26, 1971.

The Mayflower has been in the news several times in relation to political sex scandals. Judith Exner, who claimed to be President John F. Kennedy mistress, said she stayed in the hotel while in D.C. to secretly meet with the president for sexual trysts. Monica Lewinsky stayed at the Mayflower Hotel when her affair with President Bill Clinton was in the news, and she was extensively interviewed by federal investigators about the scandal in the Presidential Suite. The Mayflower was also the location where Lewinsky was photographed with President Clinton at a campaign event not long before the 1996 election; this photograph later became an iconic component of the media coverage of the scandal. On March 10, 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that New York Governor Eliot Spitzer patronized a high class prostitution service called Emperors Club VIP while staying at the Mayflower on February 13. Spitzer allegedly had sex for over two hours with a $1,000-an-hour call girl in room 871 while registered under the alias George Fox.

==Rating==
The AAA gave the hotel four diamonds out of five in 1992. The hotel has maintained that rating every year, and received four diamonds again for 2016. Forbes Travel Guide (formerly known as Mobil Guide) declined to give the hotel either five or four stars in 2016, and did not put the hotel on its &quot;recommended&quot; list.

<text>Ursula Plassnik (; born 23 May 1956) is an Austrian diplomat and politician. She was Foreign Minister of Austria between October 2004 and December 2008. She has served as the Austrian ambassador to Switzerland from 2016 to 2021.

==Early life and career==
Plassnik is from the Austrian state of Carinthia and grew up in a social democratic family. She was born in Klagenfurt on 23 May 1956. From 1971 to 1972 she was an exchange student at the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia, United States. She received a law degree from the University of Vienna in 1978 and a postgraduate Certificate of Advanced European Studies (equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree) from the College of Europe in Bruges, where she studied 1979–1980 (Salvador de Madariaga promotion). Subsequently, she worked in different positions in the Austrian Ministry for Foreign Affairs until 1997. Until that time she was considered to be politically neutral or even social-democratic.

On 1 July 1997 she was chosen by Wolfgang Schüssel, who was Austrian vice-chancellor at that time, to become his cabinet chief. In 2000 she refused an offer to work for the Council of Europe, in order to stay in Austria and help Wolfgang Schüssel when he became Austrian Chancellor in a coalition government with the Austrian Freedom Party. She is considered to be a close friend and confidante to Schüssel.

She remained cabinet chief in Schüssel&#x27;s government until 15 January 2004, when she became Austria&#x27;s ambassador to Switzerland. Recently, Ursula Plassnik&#x27;s application for the position as secretary-general of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been vetoed by Turkey, because of her opposition to that country&#x27;s bid to join the European Union. Her successor in July 2021 as ambassador is Austria career diplomat Maria Rotheiser-Scotti.

==Foreign Minister of Austria, 2004–2008==
Plassnik was appointed Foreign Minister on 18 October 2004, and sworn in on 20 October succeeding Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who resigned to become a European commissioner. She joined the Austrian People&#x27;s Party after receiving the offer to become foreign minister. On 2 December 2008 she was succeeded by Michael Spindelegger.

Plassnik voiced concern over the 2006 Lebanon War. She called for an immediate end to hostilities in Lebanon.

==Other activities==
* European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), Member of the Council
* Foreign Policy and United Nations Association of Austria (UNA-AUSTRIA), Member of the Board
* Paris School of International Affairs (PSIA), Member of the Strategic Committee
* Trilateral Commission, Member of the Executive Committee

==Personal life==
Plassnik has been married twice. Her first marriage was to Dr. Georg Posch, who became secretary general of the Austrian Parliament. Her second marriage was to Swiss diplomat Gérard Stoudmann. She stands out in public due to her height, at tall.

At Plassnik&#x27;s initiative, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim gave his long-awaited first performance in Egypt at the Cairo Opera House and conducted the Cairo Symphony Orchestra in Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 in April 2009. Barenboim had planned to make his Egyptian debut in January 2009 as part of a world tour with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, the Arab-Israeli group he founded with the writer Edward Said. But that concert was canceled out of concern for the performers&#x27; safety because of fighting in Gaza.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Nowell Salmon, (20 February 1835 – 14 February 1912) was a Royal Navy officer. As a junior officer he served in the naval brigade and took part in the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny. He was a member of the force defending the Residency when he volunteered to climb a tree near the wall of the Shah Nujeff mosque to observe the fall of shot, despite being under fire himself and wounded in the thigh. He and his colleague, Leading Seaman John Harrison, were awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces for this action.

A few years later Salmon was dispatched from British Honduras (now Belize) to take custody of William Walker, an American citizen who had briefly been president of Nicaragua, but who was now attempting further conquests in Central America. The British Government regarded Walker as a menace to its own affairs in the region. Salmon captured Walker and delivered him to the authorities in Honduras, who promptly had him court-martialed and executed.

Salmon went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, then Commander-in-Chief, China Station and finally Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth.

==Early career==

Salmon was the son of Reverend Henry Salmon, Rector of Swarraton and Emily Salmon (daughter of Admiral William Nowell), Salmon was educated at Marlborough College and joined the Royal Navy as cadet in May 1847. Promoted to midshipman, he was appointed to the second-rate in the Baltic Sea in March 1854 and saw action during the Crimean War. Promoted to lieutenant on 5 January 1856, he joined the gunboat HMS &quot;Ant&quot; in March 1856 before transferring to the frigate on the East Indies Station later that year. He served in the naval brigade and took part in the Siege of Lucknow in November 1857 during the Indian Mutiny. He was a member of the force defending the Residency when he volunteered to climb a tree near the wall of the Shah Nujeff mosque to observe the fall of shot, despite being under fire himself and wounded in the thigh. He and his colleague, Leading Seaman John Harrison, were awarded the Victoria Cross. His citation reads:

Salmon took part in the Recapture of Lucknow in March 1858 and was promoted to commander on 22 March 1858. He became commanding officer of the sloop on the North America and West Indies Station in November 1859. In 1860, Salmon was dispatched from British Honduras (now Belize) to take custody of William Walker, an American citizen who had briefly been president of Nicaragua, but who was now attempting further conquests in Central America. The British Government regarded Walker as a menace to its own affairs in the region. Salmon captured Walker and delivered him to the authorities in Honduras, who promptly had him court-martialed and shot.

Promoted to captain on 12 December 1863, Salmon became commanding officer of the ironclad warship in the Mediterranean Fleet in March 1869 and then commanded the ironclad warship under the Commander-in-Chief, Queenstown in Ireland in April 1874. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 29 May 1875 and made a naval aide-de-camp to the Queen on 12 December that same year, before becoming commanding officer of the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet on 28 November 1877.

==Senior command==

Promoted to rear admiral on 2 August 1879, Salmon became Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, with his flag in the corvette , in April 1882. Promoted to vice admiral on 1 July 1885, he was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, China Station, with his flag in the armoured cruiser , in December 1887.

Salmon was promoted to full admiral on 10 September 1891, and became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in June 1894. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 22 June 1897, and led Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Review at Spithead on 26 June. He was appointed First and Principal Naval Aide-de-camp to the Queen on 23 August 1897. Promoted to admiral of the fleet on 13 January 1899, he retired in February 1905, died at his home in Southsea on 14 February 1912 and was buried at St Peter&#x27;s Churchyard in Curdridge.

Salmon&#x27;s Victoria Cross is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum in London.

==Family==
In January 1866 Salmon married Emily Augusta Saunders; they had a son and a daughter.

<text>Mission Zamora is an integrated land reform and land redistribution program in Venezuela, created in law by the &quot;Ley de Tierras&quot; (&quot;Law of Land&quot;), part of a package of 49 decrees made by Hugo Chávez in November 2001. The plan is named in honor of Ezequiel Zamora, a 19th-century Venezuelan peasant leader. 

== Background ==
Venezuela&#x27;s rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%—among the highest in Latin America—and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer. The &quot;Ley de Tierras&quot;—&quot;Law of the Lands&quot;—was passed by presidential decree in November 2001; it included the creation of Plan Zamora to implement land reforms, including redistribution, in Venezuelan agriculture. The plan was created for several pressing reasons: to stimulate the agricultural sector in Venezuela in order to provide food security to the country (the only net food importer in Latin America) and more economic activity, to break up the concentrated economic power of the &quot;latifundios&quot; (75–80% of land owned by 5% of landowners, 2% owned 60% of farmland; 60% of agricultors do not possess any land ) and redistribute wealth to the poor in Venezuela, and to discourage urbanization, which creates heavy burdens on city services in the slums of Caracas and other Venezuelan cities.

Underutilized or unused private corporate and agricultural estates would now be subject to expropriation after &quot;fair-market&quot; compensation was paid to the owners. Inheritable, inalienable, and at times communal land grants were also gifted to small farmers and farmer&#x27;s collectives. The rationale given for this program was that it would provide incentives for the eventual and gradual repopulation of the countryside and provide &quot;food security&quot; for the country by lessening the present dependence on foreign imports. There are three types of land that may be distributed under the program:
# government land,
# land that is claimed by private owners, but whose claims the government disputes (including centennially inherited land)
# and underutilized private land (including second homes, and investment property).
To date, the Chávez government has only distributed the first two types of land.

== Legal specifications ==
There are three components to the Plan&#x27;s legal specifications:
#A legal limit (a capped limit) on the size of landholdings, which varies based on conditions between 1 and 50 km2.
#A tax on unused land holdings.
#A program for distribution of government and expropriated (with compensation) unused private lands.

Venezuelan citizens between the age of 18 and 25 or who head a family may petition to benefit from the Plan&#x27;s land redistribution programs. The Plan&#x27;s participants are first granted a piece of land to and cultivate; if they cultivate it continuously for three years, they are then given official title to the land. This government-recognized title may then be inherited by the participants&#x27; relations, but its sale is legally proscribed.

== Implementation ==
Three institutions were created to carry out the land distribution program: the &quot;Instituto Nacional de Tierras&quot; (&quot;National Land Institute&quot;), which oversees land tenancy; the &quot;Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo Rural&quot; (&quot;National Rural Development Institute&quot;), which oversees aid to farmers, including technical expertise and equipment, and the &quot;Corporación de Abastecimiento y Servicios Agrícolas&quot; (&quot;Agricultural Corporation of Supplies and Services&quot;), to help with marketing. By the end of 2003, 60,000 families had received temporary title to a total of 55,000 km2 of land under this plan.

== Controversy ==

The taking of private land proved controversial among Venezuelan land owners since the introduction of The Land Law of 2001, with one Chávez ally, former governor of Cojedes state Jhonny Yanez Rangel stating during a speech that &quot;private property … is a right, but not absolute&quot;, while also placing emphasis on the importance of &quot;the collective interest&quot;. The military was often involved in land takeovers, with some allegations of the Bolivarian National Guard violently taking land from families. In 2010, Venezuela tied with Chad and Zimbabwe for 2nd worst property rights in the world according to the International Property Rights Index from Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative U.S. advocacy group. By 2014, the International Property Rights Index rated Venezuela as having the worst property rights in the world.

<text>2M1207, 2M1207A or 2MASS J12073346–3932539 is a brown dwarf located in the constellation Centaurus; a companion object, 2M1207b, may be the first extrasolar planetary-mass companion to be directly imaged, and is the first discovered orbiting a brown dwarf.

2M1207 was discovered during the course of the 2MASS infrared sky survey: hence the &quot;2M&quot; in its name, followed by its celestial coordinates. With a fairly early (for a brown dwarf) spectral type of M8, it is very young, and probably a member of the TW Hydrae association. Its estimated mass is around 25 Jupiter masses. The companion, 2M1207b, is estimated to have a mass of 5–6 Jupiter masses. Still glowing red hot, it will shrink to a size slightly smaller than Jupiter as it cools over the next few billion years.

An initial photometric estimate for the distance to 2M1207 was 70 parsecs. In December 2005, American astronomer reported a more accurate distance (53 ± 6 parsecs) to 2M1207 using the moving cluster method. The new distance gives a fainter luminosity for 2M1207. Recent trigonometric parallax results have confirmed this moving cluster distance, leading to a distance estimate of 53 ± 1 parsec or 172 ± 3 light years.
==Planetary system==
Like classical T Tauri stars, many brown dwarfs are surrounded by disks of gas and dust which accrete onto the brown dwarf. 2M1207 was first suspected to have such a disk because of its broad Hα line. This was later confirmed by ultraviolet spectroscopy. The existence of a dust disk has also been confirmed by infrared observations and with ALMA. In general, accretion from disks are known to produce fast-moving jets, perpendicular to the disk, of ejected material. This has also been observed for 2M1207; an April 2007 paper in the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot; reports that this brown dwarf is spouting jets of material from its poles. The jets, which extend around 109 kilometers into space, were discovered using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the European Southern Observatory. Material in the jets streams into space at a few kilometers per second.

2M1207b shows weak accretion from a disk, inferred from emission lines of hydrogen and helium in medium-resolution NIRSpec data. Surprisingly 2M1207b does not show absorption due to methane, which was predicted to be present for this object. It was suggested that very young objects have a L/T-transition starts at a later spectral type.

<text>Timothy John Binyon (18 February 1936 – 7 October 2004) was an English scholar and crime writer. He was a great-nephew of the poet Laurence Binyon.

==Early life==
T. J. Binyon was born in Leeds, where his father Denis was a university lecturer. When, aged 18, doing his National Service, he was assigned to the Joint Services School for Linguists in Bodmin, Cornwall, to learn Russian. There, in 1954, the young soldiers, among them Alan Bennett, Michael Frayn and Dennis Potter, were trained to serve as translators and interpreters in the Cold War. It was there that Binyon&#x27;s interest in Russian language and literature was kindled.

==Education and teaching career==
He studied at Exeter College, Oxford, but read German and Russian instead of History, which had been his original plan. After graduating he spent a year at Moscow State University. On returning to England, he took up teaching Russian literature at the University of Leeds. Eventually, in 1968, he became a fellow of Wadham College. Oxford, and taught in the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages. He served as Dean of Wadham during the 1970s and 80s and retired in the early 2000s.

==Crime fiction author and reviewer==
Apart from his academic career, Binyon had a great interest in crime fiction. He worked as a reviewer of detective fiction for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; and wrote a theoretical book—&quot;&quot;Murder Will Out&quot;: The Detective in Fiction&quot; (OUP, 1989)—and two crime novels, &quot;Swan Song&quot; (1982) and &quot;Greek Gifts&quot; (1988).

As emeritus, Binyon became a prize-winning author with a biography of Aleksandr Pushkin, &quot;Pushkin: A Biography&quot; (2002), it was the Samuel Johnson Prize winner of 2003. The book received critical acclaim and was praised by John Bayley in &quot;Literary Review&quot;: &quot;No other work on Pushkin on the same scale, and with the same grasp of atmosphere and detail, exists in English, or in any other language apart from Russian.&quot;

==Marriages and death==
Binyon was married twice, first to Felicity Butterwick (1974–1992) and, after a divorce, to Helen Ellis (from 2000 up to his death). He died, aged 68, of sudden heart failure in his house in Witney, Oxfordshire, while doing research for what was to be his next book, on Mikhail Lermontov.

<doc id="1087659" wikidata="Q26961743" url="?curid=1087659" title="Kansas City Comets (1979–1991)">
<text>The Kansas City Comets were a professional indoor soccer team based for most of its existence in Kansas City, Missouri. They played in the original Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL; later the Major Soccer League) from 1979–1991, when they folded. They played their home games in Kemper Arena.

The team originated as the Detroit Lightning, which joined the MISL as an expansion team in the 1979–1980 season. After a year in Detroit the team relocated to San Francisco, California, becoming the San Francisco Fog. They moved to Kansas City in 1981, where they remained for ten years. In Kansas City the team went to the league playoffs seven times, advancing to the division finals three times.

==History==
In 1979 the Major Indoor Soccer League placed an expansion franchise in Detroit, Michigan. The team, then known as the Detroit Lightning, failed to make the playoffs, and at the end of the season were purchased by entrepreneur David Schoenstadt, later the founder of Discovery Zone. Schoenstadt relocated the team to San Francisco, California, where they were renamed the San Francisco Fog. They again failed to make the playoffs in the 1980–1981 season, and Schoenstadt moved the team once more, this time to Kansas City, Missouri, rebranding them the Kansas City Comets.

The Comets failed to qualify for the playoffs in the 1981–1982 season, but were thereafter consistent playoff contenders, making a total of seven playoff appearances in ten seasons. They advanced to the quarterfinals in 1985, the division semifinals in 1987, and the division finals in 1988, 1990, and 1991. They had enjoyed a strong attendance in their early years, but ticket sales declined later in their run, dropping from an average high of 15,786 in the 1983–1984 season to a low of 7,103 in the 1990–1991 season. Though they finished second in the league in their last two seasons of operations, the Comets could not withstand the drop in revenue, and folded at the end of the 1990–1991 season.

The Comets were followed the next season by the Kansas City Attack of the National Professional Soccer League; this team was known as the &quot;Kansas City Comets&quot; from 2001–2005. In 2010 the Missouri Comets, based in nearby Independence, joined the new Major Indoor Soccer League, carrying on the legacy of the original Comets.

Stars and fan favorites included Enzo Di Pede, Billy Gazonas, Gino Schiraldi, Greg Makowski, Victor Petroni, Jan Goossens, Damir Haramina, Kia, Dale Mitchell, Alan Mayer, Zoran Savic, Jim Schwab, Gordon Hill, Tasso Koutsoukos, Manny Schwartz, David Doyle, Barry Wallace, Tim Clark, Elson Seale, Yilmaz Orhan, and Ty Keough as well as coaches Pat McBride and Rick Benben.

<text>A ham hock (or hough) or pork knuckle is the joint between the tibia/fibula and the metatarsals of the foot of a pig, where the foot was attached to the hog&#x27;s leg. It is the portion of the leg that is neither part of the ham proper nor the ankle or foot (trotter), but rather the extreme shank end of the leg bone.

==Uses==
Since this piece generally consists of much skin, tendons and ligaments, it requires long cooking through stewing or braising to be made palatable. The cut of meat can be cooked with greens and other vegetables or in flavorful sauces. It is often added to soups, such as pea and ham soup, with the meat being added to the soup prior to serving. It can also be added to savoury pies. The meat of particularly meaty hocks may be removed and served as is. Ham hocks, like hog jowls (pigs&#x27; cheeks), add a distinctive flavor to various dishes. This is particularly true for collard greens, mustard greens, cabbage, green beans and navy beans.

Ham hocks are essential ingredients for the distinct flavor in soul food and other forms of American Southern country cooking. In the Appalachian Mountains, it is common to add ham hocks along with chopped onion and spices to pots of pinto beans to make the meal more hearty. In the Mid-Atlantic States, in rural regions settled by the Pennsylvania Dutch, hocks are a commonly used ingredient for making a kind of meat loaf called scrapple. Eisbein is the name of the joint in north German, and at the same time the name of a dish of roasted ham hock, called Schweinshaxe in Bavaria, Stelze in Austria and Wädli in Switzerland. The dish is very popular in Poland, using this cut. The dish is also popular in the Czech Republic, where it is most popular in Ostrava, close to the Polish border. It is the most popular dish in Polish-Czech Silesia, where it is served in a soup made from sauerkraut called Golonka (Czech: Vepřové koleno). Ham hocks are also popular when boiled with escarole, more commonly called endives, in Italian-American cuisine. Fläsklägg med rotmos is a Swedish dish consisting of cured ham hocks and a mash of rutabaga and potatoes, served with sweet mustard. In Canada, and particularly Montreal, ham hocks are referred to as &quot;pigs&#x27; knuckles&quot; and are served in bistros and taverns with baked beans. In northern Italy ham hocks are referred to as stinco, and is often served roast whole with sauerkraut. In the UK ham hocks are used to make soup.

<doc id="1087672" wikidata="Q557236" url="?curid=1087672" title="Cow hitch">
<text>The cow hitch, also called the lark&#x27;s head, is a hitch knot used to attach a rope to an object. The cow hitch comprises a pair of single hitches tied in opposing directions, as compared to the clove hitch in which the single hitches are tied in the same direction. It has several variations and is known under a variety of names. It can be tied either with the end of the rope or with a bight.

==History==
A simple and useful knotted structure, the cow hitch has been known since at least the first century when described by Greek physician Heraklas in a monograph on surgical knots and slings. Known under a variety of names, this knot has been used both on land and at sea. The common alternate name &quot;lark&#x27;s head&quot; is attributed to Tom Bowling (pseudonym) in the 1866 work &quot;The Book of Knots&quot; which is presumed to have been adapted from a French manuscript; lark&#x27;s head is a literal translation of the French name for the knot, &quot;tête d&#x27;alouette&quot;.

==Variations==
The underlying cow hitch structure can be formed and used in a variety of ways. These variations are differentiated by method used to form the knot and the way in which it is loaded. In particular, the knot can be formed with an end of the rope, in a closed loop or strap, or a combination of these two in which it is tied with the end and then formed into a loop by securing the free end to the standing part. Although certain names tend to be historically associated with a particular variations, real-world naming is not necessarily consistent between various users and applications.

===With the end===
When tied using the end of a rope, such as when securing an animal&#x27;s lead to a vertical post or stake, this knot was said to be more resistant to loosening than the clove hitch as the animal wanders around the post. In general, however, this single-ended form of the cow hitch is less stable compared to the variations in which both ends are loaded.

===In a closed loop or strap===

This form is commonly known as a strap hitch or girth hitch, the latter term being common among climbers. It is the method commonly used to attach luggage tags which have a pre-tied loop of string or elastic. This form is also often used to connect loop-ended lanyards to handheld electronic equipment, since it can be tied without access to the ends of the fastening loop.

===With the end, then secured into a loop===
When tied by threading the end and then the end is secured to the standing part, the knot is known as a bale sling hitch.

== Applications ==
=== Tatting ===
The craft of tatting is composed primarily of lark&#x27;s head knots over carrier threads. A lark&#x27;s head is called a double stitch in tatting.

=== Friendship bracelets ===
In the context of friendship bracelets, the lark&#x27;s head is called the reverse knot or the forward backward knot or the backward forward knot if the author is being directionally specific for instructional purposes.

=== Cableman&#x27;s hitch ===
Another application for the cow hitch is in the handling of large electric power cable in surface mines. Known colloquially as a &quot;Cableman&#x27;s hitch&quot;, it is also used to attach loops of cable to the back of a pick-up truck during a shovel move. As the cable can weigh upwards of 22 pounds per foot and 3–4 loops of cable can be attached to one length of rope, a clove hitch&#x27;s shearing force would damage the cable jacket. The Cableman&#x27;s hitch puts the strain onto the hitch crossing over the two running ends of the rope. 

=== Products that use cow hitch knots ===
* The Nintendo Wiimote, for securing the strap to the Wiimote
* Some Mobile phones accessory use this knot to secure themselves to the phones
* Textile/Rubber Bands attached to the Zip Pullers is usually tied with Cow Hitch, usually to reduce the size of the Puller.

<doc id="1087681" wikidata="Q6658552" url="?curid=1087681" title="Liverpool Salvage Corps">
<text>Liverpool Salvage Corps was a service in Liverpool, England, founded and maintained by fire insurers, whose aim was to reduce the loss and damage caused by fires, to help mitigate the effects of fire and of fire-fighting and to salvage both premises and goods affected by fire. It was founded in 1842 and operated until April 1984, when its functions were transferred to the Merseyside Fire Brigade. Similar salvage corps also operated in London and Glasgow.

==Origin==
The industrial and commercial revolution of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries saw a considerable rise in the prosperity of the port of Liverpool. Warehouses, sheds and storage yards were being hurriedly built and filled with goods that came into the port from all over the world. Tobacco, sugar and cotton were arriving daily and with no regulation and poor warehousing practices fire began to become an ever-increasing problem.

Liverpool had already lost its town hall in 1795 to a serious fire and following an exceptionally large blaze at Lancelot Hey in 1833, in which numerous warehouses and homes were destroyed, a private parliamentary bill was successfully enacted to establish a Fire Brigade in Liverpool. This brigade was to be part of the Liverpool City Police Force and became operational in 1836 (London took another 24 years before it had the &quot;London Fire Engine Establishment&quot; - an insurance organisation). Even though the City now had an efficient Fire Brigade fire losses continued at a high level.

In the early hours of Friday 23 September 1842 a fire started in a &quot;dry salters yard&quot; in Crompton Street in the heart of Liverpool&#x27;s Dockland. A strong wind blowing from the sea fanned the flames towards the next property - an oil and varnish mill. The newly formed fire brigade stood no chance of halting the fire once it reached the 1000 barrels of turpentine, and by dawn 9 bonded warehouses, 5 free warehouses, 7 large storage sheds, a cooperage, several timber yards, and numerous stables and 16 cottages were completely destroyed. 1 fireman and 3 labourers lost their lives.

The bulk of the financial loss had to be born by the fire insurance companies and at today’s prices ran into many millions of pounds. Within days of the fire a Committee, comprising the Secretary of the Liverpool Fire Office and the agents of the Royal, Phoenix, Sun and North British insurance companies met and resolved that a salvage brigade be established. Similar corps were established in London in 1865 and Glasgow 1873.

==Operation of the Salvage Corps==
The Liverpool Salvage Corps had three distinct areas of operational service.

===Before a fire===
The original Salvage Committee established a set of rules and regulations for all warehouses and sheds seeking to do business in the Liverpool area and who wanted to buy insurance cover. These rules set out in minute detail how premises were to be constructed, maintained and managed. Each building was given a classification which dictated what goods were allowed to be stored therein. Fire prevention and minimising the spread of fire were of paramount importance. Each registered premises was inspected in detail every year against the original classification and was randomly visited 2 or 3 times a week to make sure storage and housekeeping was of a high standard. All warehouse keepers had to be registered with the Liverpool Salvage Corps and licensed by the City Council. By these rules and regulations a great deal of order and organisation was brought to Liverpool&#x27;s warehousing industry and in return for cooperating the warehouse owners enjoyed a preferential rate of insurance.

===After the fire===
Cotton was the largest and most important trade in Liverpool Docks which handled half of Britain&#x27;s cotton imports by 1800, and 90 percent by 1830. The Liverpool Salvage Corps operated the largest cotton recovery plant in the United Kingdom. Cotton has a very high salvage potential. In the hands of experts as much as 80% of even a badly burned bale of cotton can be recovered and sold for a similar value to that of the original cotton. Liverpool Salvage Corps returned many millions of pounds to the insurance companies from its work as salvors.

===During the fire===
Safety considerations dictated that Liverpool Salvage Corps personnel wore uniforms and helmets similar to those of Local Authority Fire-fighters, although it was sufficiently different to make the Corps crews easily identifiable on the fire ground.

Salvage tenders were not front-line fire fighting and rescue vehicles. Their function and equipment was to prevent avoidable damage from fire fighting operations. Most major fires are extinguished using water and it is this that can result in extensive damage. A modern fire appliance can deliver many tons of water onto a fire in a very short period of time. Huge savings can be made by expert crews who have been trained in loss prevention measures and can prioritise their actions based on commercial knowledge. Speed is of the essence if unnecessary damage is to be avoided, which was why Salvage Tenders were painted red and used claxons - it is pointless turning up to a fire when all the damage has already occurred.

==Ranks==
The ranks of Liverpool Salvage Corps were an altered version of regular Fire Brigade/Fire Service Ranks.


==End==
The Liverpool Salvage Corps ceased to exist in May 1984 after 142 years.

<text>Sturm Café is an electronic body music band from Gävle, Sweden.

Music made by Sturm Café provided the soundtrack of the movie .

==History==
Sturm Café was founded by the two teenage boys Gustav and Jonatan who met at a very young age in Gävle, Sweden. As teens they began playing with various instruments and the equipment in Jansson&#x27;s father&#x27;s studio. They released a couple of demo cassette tapes under the name The Xenophobian Alliance which were handed out to close friends. The instrumentation was a cheap digital synth with an Atari for sequencing and an analog 4 channel portable studio.

Later on in 2002 they bought some analogue synthesizers and a digital portable studio and the music started to spread through mp3.com. At this time, the name of the band had been changed to Sturm Café as suggested by Gustav&#x27;s father who was a fan of EBM bands such as DAF and Front 242. Influenced by Gustav&#x27;s father&#x27;s music collection, the duo moved toward an EBM sound with minimalistic analogue basslines, monotonous drum machines and chanting vocals in German. Despite being Swedish, they were inspired to sing in German owing to Löftstedt having learned German in school and the language being understood as a typical aspect of EBM style.

This eventually led to some live gigs in early 2003 and in the summer of 2004 they performed live at Sweden&#x27;s biggest open air alternative music festival, Arvika Festival. Later that year, they signed a contract with the record label Progress Productions and played several shows in Germany including at Berlin&#x27;s Bodybeats club.

One year later, the album &quot;So Seelisch, So Schön!&quot; was released and climbed to position 75 on the Swedish official album sell chart. That autumn, Jonatan moved to Poland for medicine studies. Sturm Café was put on hold. However, Jonatan moved back to Sweden the next year and the work with the band could continue. Even after returning to Sweden, Löftstedt and Jansson lived an 8-hour car ride from each other, making it difficult to work together given their dependence on vintage equipment.

In 2010, the band opened for Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft at BIMFest in Belgium. That year the band also embarked on starting a label, SCR (Sturm Café Releases), with their first release being the 7&quot; single &quot;Koka Kola Freiheit&quot;. In considering starting the label, the band balanced demands of thir non-music careers with the needs of a third-party label, ultimately deciding that the risks of running their own label were outweighed by control of the release schedule and creative process. 

The band played their first non-European shows in Mexico City in 2015 and the following year in Lima, Peru.

Löftstedt also has a side project of dance music that he determined did not fit with Sturm Café called John Steiner Explosion. Some tracks from his side project were released on the band&#x27;s &quot;Rarities 3&quot; compilation in 2020.

<text>Merseytravel is the passenger transport executive responsible for the coordination of public transport in the Liverpool City Region in North West England. It was established on 1 December 1969 as the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive. 

In July 2024, it was announced it is to be rebranded as Transport for Liverpool City Region (TfLCR) in the future. 
==Governance==

The Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority and Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive were established as a result of the Transport Act 1968. The authority, which was responsible for transport strategy and policy, included representatives from 18 different councils. The executive was responsible for day-to-day operation of transport services. In 1974, when the transport organisation&#x27;s boundaries were made co-extensive with the new metropolitan county of Merseyside which was formally created by the Local Government Act 1972, the authority was composed of 23 councillors of the new Merseyside County Council.

When the metropolitan county councils were abolished by the Local Government Act 1985, new structures had to be created. A new joint board - again called The Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority - was created. It was later renamed the Merseyside Integrated Transport Authority and composed 18 councillors assembled from Merseyside&#x27;s five districts: Liverpool, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton and Wirral. 

On 1 April 2014, the Merseyside Integrated Transport Authority was abolished and reformed as the Merseytravel Committee of Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The transport authority provides services across Merseyside, and provides strategic transport advice to Borough of Halton.

In May 2021, Mayor Steve Rotherham set out a plan for all trains, buses and ferries to become an integrated transport system under Merseytravel, owned by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

On 19 July 2024, the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority announced Merseytravel would be renamed to Transport for Liverpool City Region (TfLCR) to help fall in line with Transport for London and Transport for Greater Manchester, as part of efforts to promote a connected network across the six areas that form the city region. The actual date of the rename has not been confirmed.

==Rail services==

Merseytravel, as the passenger transport executive, is responsible for the co-ordination of local rail services which operate within Liverpool City Region under the direction of the combined authority. Merseytravel is the owner of Merseyrail which operates services across Merseyside, Cheshire, and Lancashire under a franchise model. 
===Merseyrail===

As a result of the privatisation of British Rail, the Northern and Wirral lines of the local Merseyrail rail network were brought together as the Merseyrail Electrics passenger franchise, that was privatised on 19 January 1997. Under the original privatisation legislation of 1993, PTEs were co-signatories of franchise agreements covering their areas. The first train operating company (TOC) awarded the franchise contract was MTL, originally the operating arm of the PTE, but privatised itself in 1985. It traded under the Merseyrail Electrics brand, but after MTL was sold to Arriva, the company was rebranded Arriva Trains Merseyside from 27 April 2001.

When the franchise came up for renewal, reflecting the exclusive nature of the two lines - being largely isolated from the rest of the National Rail network and with no through passenger services to/from outside the Merseyrail network, the decision was taken to remove it from the national framework and bring it into local control. As a result, using the Merseyrail Electrics Network Order 2002 the Secretary of State for Transport exempted the system from being designated as a railway franchise under the privatisation legislation (the Railways Act 1993). This allowed the PTE to contract out the lines themselves, which it did with Merseyrail operated by Serco-Abellio commencing a 25-year contract on 20 July 2003.

Unlike most rolling stock that is owned by private sector rolling stock companies, Merseytravel will outright own the Class 777 fleet, operated by Merseyrail. The current Class 507 and Class 508 fleets are owned by Angel Trains and leased to Merseyrail.

===Merseytravel City line===

A third line, the City line, also historically branded as Merseyrail under British Rail, was also privatised under the 1993 Act, but as part of the much larger North West Regional Railways (NWRR) franchise. On 2 March 1997, North Western Trains, later rebranded First North Western, commenced operating the franchise. Some Class 142 units were repainted in Merseytravel&#x27;s yellow livery. This line was not included in the 2003 exemption given to the other two lines, and so it has continued as part of the government-administered rail franchise system, although the role of PTEs in the franchising process has altered due by the 2005 Railways Act. From 11 December 2004, the NWRR franchise was merged into a new Northern franchise and operated by Northern Rail. The Merseyrail Class 142 units were repainted into Northern Rail livery. On 1 April 2016, the franchise was taken over by Arriva Rail North.

==Bus services==

From 1969 until 1986, the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (PTE) operated a large proportion of bus services on Merseyside under the &quot;Merseyside Transport&quot; brand. The PTE took over the provision of bus services in Liverpool, Birkenhead and Wallasey from their respective local authorities in 1970, and the bus services provided by St Helens and Stockport councils in 1974. The PTE also coordinated and jointly provided bus services on Merseyside with National Bus Company subsidiaries Crosville and Ribble. These were services in Liverpool, Sefton and the Wirral, and longer-distance services to and from Cheshire and Lancashire. The PTE was also heavily involved in the running of Crosville and Ribble garages on Merseyside. Similar arrangements also existed with Lancashire United Transport/Greater Manchester Transport and Warrington Borough Transport from services connecting Merseyside with Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Lancashire.

The Transport Act 1985 mandated the deregulation and privatisation of bus services in England (other than in Greater London). Following deregulation in 1986, Merseyside Transport services were rebranded as &quot;Merseybus&quot;, and subsequently privatised as MTL. The co-ordination of Merseyside&#x27;s bus network disappeared: Crosville, Ribble, now known as North Western and Greater Manchester&#x27;s GM Buses, became competitors of Merseybus, along with new entrants like CMT Buses, Fareway, Halton Transport, Liverbus, Liverline, PMT&#x27;s Red Rider, Village Group, and other smaller operators.

Merseyside&#x27;s popular bus corridors became a venue for intense competition, with less profitable services ignored and, in some cases, disappearing. A period of consolidation began in the mid-1990s: both Merseybus parent company MTL, and North Western -  now owned by Arriva – took over a number of the new entrants and the remainder folded. In 2000 MTL was itself bought by Arriva and is now part of an enlarged Arriva North West. However, Arriva was required by the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission to divest some of its Liverpool services, which are now operated by Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire. There are also smaller Merseyside operators like Cumfybus and HTL Buses.

Today, Merseytravel is also responsible for providing bus services which are considered socially necessary but are not profitable; these are operated by other operators, using a best value tendering system. Fares are presently subsidised at levels lower than local commercial services.

== Ferries and tunnels ==

Merseytravel owns and operates the Mersey Ferry service between Liverpool Pier Head, Seacombe in Wallasey and Woodside in Birkenhead. The fleet consists of two vessels: &quot;Royal Iris of the Mersey&quot; and &quot;Snowdrop&quot;.

There are three transport tunnels under the River Mersey. Merseytravel is responsible for the two road tunnels, Kingsway and Queensway, under the River Mersey and also controls the Mersey Tunnels Police. Merseyrail also runs through a railway tunnel under the river connecting central Liverpool and Birkenhead which was the first transport tunnel under the Mersey to be built, in the nineteenth century.

==Non-transport ventures==

Merseytravel, through Mersey Ferries, owns the Liverpool tourist attraction The Beatles Story, a museum dedicated to The Beatles located on Royal Albert Dock.

==Future projects==
Neil Scales, the former chief executive and director general of Merseytravel, in his 2011 presentation &quot;Growing the Railways on Merseyside,&quot; outlined future projects that Merseytravel may be involved in:
* Electrification of Bidston - Wrexham sections
* St Helens Junction, and Bootle - Aintree branch
* Further electrification between Hunts Cross - Warrington - Manchester, Headbolt Lane - Wigan and Ormskirk - Preston
* Liverpool F.C. football stadium access from the Bootle branch
* Re-investment in the Burscough Curves, linking Southport to Ormskirk and Preston
* Third rail electrification between Helsby and Ellesmere Port, (see Ellesmere Port to Warrington Line)

Merseytravel have also stated their support to linking Liverpool to the High Speed 2 network with a directly connected, brand new, twin-track line.

In September 2017, a report was compiled into the reopening of Liverpool St James railway station which concluded that the reopening of the station would be highly beneficial. It is due to open in 2027 under the name Liverpool Baltic railway station.

Liverpool City Region Combined Authority announced in August 2019 that they were planning on using £172million of funding on several major transport projects. These included:
* Re-opening St James railway station
* Purchasing two low carbon Mersey ferries to replace the current aging fleet
In 2023, a new ferry was commissioned. Making the announcement, Mayor Rotheram said that the multimillion project will “ensure that the iconic Ferry Cross the Mersey will continue to be enjoyed by generations to come.” The new ferry will be designed and constructed by Birkenhead shipbuilder Cammell Laird and is due to launch in 2026. 

==Ticketing==
Merseytravel are responsible for the management of local, reduced cost, integrated ticketing systems, and as part of this issue the ITSO-compatible MetroCard smartcard, on to which certain local travel passes are loaded. They are also the body responsible in the county of Merseyside for providing and funding concessionary travel for the elderly and disabled, through the English National Concessionary Bus Travel Scheme. For those not at the present Pension age, but over the former applicable ages of 60 and 65, for men and women respectively, Merseytravel are funded to operate a localised version of the scheme.

<doc id="1087714" wikidata="Q3106860" url="?curid=1087714" title="Mike Hampton">
<text>Michael William Hampton, Jr. (born September 9, 1972) is an American former professional baseball player. Hampton played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a pitcher from 1993 through 2010. He pitched for the Seattle Mariners, Houston Astros, New York Mets, Colorado Rockies, Atlanta Braves and Arizona Diamondbacks. He was the bullpen coach for the Mariners before resigning on July 9, 2017.

Hampton is a two-time MLB All-Star. He won five Silver Slugger Awards and a Gold Glove Award. He was the Most Valuable Player of the 2000 National League Championship Series, and he pitched in the 2000 World Series for the Mets.

==Early life==
Hampton was born in Brooksville, Florida, when his father, Mike Hampton Sr., was 19 and his mother, Joan, was 16. He was the oldest of three children. Hampton was raised in Homosassa, Florida, and attended Crystal River High School.

In high school, Hampton was recruited to play college football as a defensive back at Notre Dame, Miami and Florida State.

==Career==
=== Seattle Mariners ===
Hampton was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the sixth round of the 1990 Major League Baseball draft. He made his Major League debut in 1993. After the season, he was traded to the Houston Astros with Mike Felder for Eric Anthony.

=== Houston Astros ===
Hampton became a starter for Houston in 1995, and kept his ERA under 4.00 for every season he was with the Astros. In 1999, Hampton had his best year, finishing with a 22–4 record, best in the National League, and a 2.90 ERA. He picked up his first of five Silver Slugger Awards and narrowly finished second in National League Cy Young Award voting to Randy Johnson. That season, Hampton batted .311 (23 for 74).

=== New York Mets ===
Entering the final year of his contract, Hampton was dealt to the New York Mets. He went 15–10 with a 3.12 ERA and helped the Mets reach the postseason. With two wins and no earned runs in two starts, Hampton was named the MVP of the 2000 NLCS. Hampton received a loss in his only World Series appearance.

===Colorado Rockies===
The Colorado Rockies signed Hampton to an eight-year, $121 million contract on December 9, 2000. It was the largest contract in baseball history at the time, although it would quickly be passed by Alex Rodríguez&#x27;s ten-year, $252 million contract with the Texas Rangers only two days later. Hampton once claimed that he had chosen to move to Colorado because of &quot;the school system&quot;, a statement that is often derisively referenced by sportswriters. The Rockies hoped Hampton, who had been one of the best pitchers in the league over the past few seasons, would be able to succeed in the tough pitching conditions of Coors Field.

Hampton went 14–13 with a 5.41 ERA in 2001, often succumbing to control problems. The next season, 2002, Hampton went 7–15 with his ERA climbing to a league-high 6.15 and batters hitting .313 off of him. Hampton hit ten home runs and had a .300+ batting average over two seasons.

His best all-around offensive season came in 2001 with the Colorado Rockies, when he would hit .291 with seven home runs. The next year he hit three home runs and batted .344. From 1999 to 2003, Hampton would go on to win five consecutive Silver Slugger Awards.

===Atlanta Braves===
In November 2002, Hampton was traded to the Florida Marlins, then to the Atlanta Braves. Hampton won 14 games and got his ERA back down to 3.84 in 2003. Hampton won the Gold Glove Award for pitchers in 2003, the only player other than Greg Maddux to win the award for that position in the National League from 1990 to 2008. He overcame a slow start in 2004 by winning 10 of his last 11 decisions and helping to propel the Braves to another division championship.

Hampton&#x27;s 2005 season was limited heavily by injuries. He went 5–3 in twelve starts, but was lost for the rest of the season with an elbow injury on August 19, 2005. Hampton had Tommy John surgery on September 25, 2005, and missed the entire 2006 season rehabbing.

The Braves were hoping for Hampton to be ready to rejoin the rotation in time for the start of the 2007 season. The rehab was on schedule until Hampton tore his oblique muscle on March 7, 2007, which was to sideline him until at least May. Soon after, the Braves signed Mark Redman to be a left-handed starting pitcher for them in case Hampton was not able to return to action soon. After Hampton threw a bullpen session on April 8, the Braves shut Hampton down due to recurring elbow pain and said that he would see Dr. David Altchek, who had performed his Tommy John surgery in 2005. The next day, it was announced after having another left elbow procedure, that Hampton would miss the entire 2007 season.

Hampton began a rehab assignment on November 22, 2007, for Navojoa of the Mexican Winter League. In the first inning, he attempted to make a play on a comebacker and left during warmups before the second inning, feeling discomfort in his hamstring. The rest of his rehab was left in doubt.

However, Hampton reported to &quot;Camp Roger&quot; on time in late January. He threw off the mound for Bobby Cox and Roger McDowell, both of whom were impressed with Hampton&#x27;s steady progress. Hampton arrived a day before pitchers and catchers were due to report at Lake Buena Vista. He ran sprints, played catch with teammates,continued to pitch off the mound, threw to live batters: Mark Kotsay, Tim Hudson, and Corky Miller.

On April 3, 2008, Hampton was scheduled to make his long-anticipated return to the Braves rotation in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. While warming up, however, Hampton strained his left pectoral muscle, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list.

On July 26, 2008, Hampton made his first major league start since August 2005 against the Philadelphia Phillies. However, he was soon injured again, and finished the season with only 13 appearances. His final 2008 stats included a 3–4 record and a 4.85 ERA.

===Return to Astros===

On December 3, 2008, Hampton signed a 1-year contract worth $2 million with the Houston Astros. Hampton could have earned another $2 million in performance-based incentives.

Hampton chose to wear uniform #11 in his return to Houston to honor his old friend, longtime Astro catcher Brad Ausmus. His #10 that he wore during his first stint with Houston was being worn by Miguel Tejada. He pitched in the number four spot behind Brian Moehler.

On September 15, 2009, Hampton underwent full rotator cuff surgery to repair a tear and was expected to miss the entire 2010 season.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
Despite initially being expected to miss the whole season, on August 21, 2010, Mike Hampton signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He returned to the major leagues with the Diamondbacks, throwing innings in ten appearances.

After the season, Hampton re-signed with Arizona to a minor league deal for 2011. On March 26, 2011, Hampton announced his retirement from baseball.

===Hitting stats===
In 423 games over 16 seasons, Hampton posted a .246 batting average (178-for-725) with 97 runs, 22 doubles, 5 triples, 16 home runs, 79 RBI, 47 walks and a .356 slugging percentage. In 11 postseason games, Hampton batted .250 (5-for-20) with 1 run and 1 RBI.

== Coaching career ==

=== Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim organization===
In 2013, Hampton was named the pitching coach for the Arkansas Travelers, the AA affiliate for the Angels, joining manager Tim Bogar, who was his teammate for the Astros from 1997 to 1999. Hampton was not retained as coach after the 2013 season.

=== Seattle Mariners ===
After two years off from coaching, he was hired to be the bullpen coach for the Mariners, the team he played for his rookie year. He joined former Astros teammates Scott Servais (1994–95) and the aforementioned Tim Bogar on the coaching staff. He resigned on July 9, 2017.

<doc id="1087721" wikidata="Q65898" url="?curid=1087721" title="Lothar von Trotha">
<text>General Adrian Dietrich Lothar von Trotha (3 July 1848 – 31 March 1920) was a German military commander during the European new colonial era. As a brigade commander of the East Asian Expedition Corps, he was involved in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China, commanding troops which made up the German contribution to the Eight-Nation Alliance. He later served as governor of German South West Africa and Commander in Chief of its colonial forces, in which role he suppressed a native rebellion during the Herero Wars. He was widely condemned for his brutality in the Herero Wars, particularly for his role in the genocide of the Nama Khoekhoe and the Herero.

==Family==
Lothar von Trotha belonged to a prominent Saxon noble family. He was married twice; on 15 October 1872 he married Bertha Neumann, who died in 1905. 

On 19 May 1912, following his retirement from the service, he married Lucy Goldstein-Brinckmann (1881–1958), a second marriage for both. Lucy came from a Frankfurt Jewish family which had converted to Christianity. Trotha had two sons, who died without known descendants.

==Career==
Born in Magdeburg, the capital of the Province of Saxony, Trotha joined the Prussian Army in 1865 and fought in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars, for which he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class. He married Bertha Neumann on 15 October 1872.

He was commander of the Lauenburgisches Jäger Bataillon Nr. 9 for two years in Ratzeburg before he was deployed to Africa in 1894.

In 1894 Trotha was appointed commander of the colonial forces in German East Africa and was ruthlessly successful in suppressing uprisings there, including the Wahehe Rebellion. While temporarily posted to Imperial China as Brigade Commander of the East Asian Expedition Corps, he was involved in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion. On 3 May 1904 he was appointed Commander in Chief of German South West Africa and was directed to crush the native Herero rebellion.

=== Genocide of Herero and Nama ===

Trotha arrived in South West Africa on 11 June 1904, when the war against the Herero had been raging for five months. The German command up to that time had minimal success against the Herero guerrilla tactics. Initially, he too suffered losses. In October 1904 General von Trotha devised a new battle plan to end the uprisings by the Herero. At the Battle of Waterberg, he issued orders to encircle the Herero on three sides so that the only escape route was into the waterless Omaheke-Steppe, a western arm of the Kalahari Desert. The Herero fled into the desert and Trotha ordered his troops to poison water holes, erect guard posts along a 150-mile line and shoot on sight any Herero, be they man, woman or child, who attempted to escape. To make his attitude to the Herero absolutely clear, Trotha then issued the &quot;Vernichtungsbefehl&quot;, or extermination order:
I, the great general of the German soldiers, send this letter to the Hereros. The Hereros are German subjects no longer. They have killed, stolen, cut off the ears and other parts of the body of wounded soldiers, and now are too cowardly to want to fight any longer. I announce to the people that whoever hands me one of the chiefs shall receive 1,000 marks, and 5,000 marks for Samuel Maherero. The Herero nation must now leave the country. If it refuses, I shall compel it to do so with the &#x27;long tube&#x27; (cannon). Any Herero found inside the German frontier, with or without a gun or cattle, will be executed. I shall spare neither women nor children. I shall give the order to drive them away and fire on them. Such are my words to the Herero people.
He further gave orders that:

This proclamation is to be read to the troops at roll-call, with the addition that the unit that catches a captain will also receive the appropriate reward, and that the shooting at women and children is to be understood as shooting above their heads, so as to force them to run [away]. I assume absolutely that this proclamation will result in taking no more male prisoners, but will not degenerate into atrocities against women and children. The latter will run away if one shoots at them a couple of times. The troops will remain conscious of the good reputation of the German soldier.
Trotha defended his policies later in his life. &quot;It was and is my policy to use force with terrorism and even brutality.&quot; An undisclosed German soldier was reported to have said of the massacres &quot;...the death rattle of the dying and the shrieks of the mad...they echo in the sublime stillness of infinity.&quot;
Trotha&#x27;s tactics were in marked distinction to that of the Herero leaders, who were, in the main, careful to ensure that only soldiers were attacked.

Trotha&#x27;s methods caused public outcry which led the Imperial Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow to ask William II, German Emperor, to relieve Trotha of his command. This, however, was too late to help the Herero, as the few survivors had been herded into concentration camps and used as labour for German businesses, where many died of overwork, malnutrition or disease. Prior to the uprisings, there were estimated to be 80,000 Herero. The 1911 census records 15,000.

Trotha&#x27;s troops also routed the Nama. On 22 April 1905 he sent a message to the Nama, suggesting they surrender, and mentioning the fate of the Herero.
Approximately 10,000 Nama died during the fighting, the remaining 9,000 were confined to concentration camps.

On 2 November 1905, Trotha was awarded the Pour le Mérite for his services in Africa. 17 days later, Lothar von Trotha returned to Germany, and was retired in the next year. In 1910 he was given the character of a General of the Infantry. Trotha died of typhoid fever (bilious fever) on 31 March 1920 in Bonn.

==Legacy==
In 1933, the Nazi authorities had named a street in Munich as &quot;von Trotha Straße&quot;. In 2006, the Munich city council officially decided to change the name of this street to &quot;Herero Straße&quot; in honour of the general&#x27;s victims.

Otjiwarongo, Namibia had a street named after von Trotha, since &quot;long before independence&quot;. In 2016, calls to rename this street surfaced, and the municipality promised to initiate the renaming in 2017. The renaming would not occur until 2024, where the street was renamed to &quot;Ohamakari&quot;.

As General von Trotha has no living descendants, some of his distant relations traveled to Omaruru in October 2007 by invitation of the local Herero chiefs and publicly apologised for his actions. Wolf-Thilo von Trotha, a member of the family, said, &quot;We, the von Trotha family, are deeply ashamed of the terrible events that took place 100 years ago. Human rights were grossly abused that time.&quot;

On 16 August 2004 the German government under Gerhard Schröder officially apologized for the genocide, but rejected calls to pay reparations to the descendants of the Herero and Nama. &quot;We Germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by Germans at that time,&quot; said Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Germany&#x27;s development aid minister. In addition, she admitted the massacres were equivalent to genocide. The two countries have generally had a good relationship since and Germany has tailored economic and political packages for the people of Namibia.

In May 2021, the German government officially recognized the genocide and agreed to pay €1.1 billion over 30 years to fund projects in communities that were impacted by the genocide.

The 2023 survival horror video game &quot;Ad Infinitum&quot; features a semi-fictionalized Trotha, although differing in name: Lother von Schmidt. This version also had a son, Karl, and two grandsons, Johannes and Paul, the latter of whom is the game&#x27;s protagonist. His roles in the Boxer Rebellion and the Herero Wars are mentioned, including part of his infamous declaration to the Herero.

<text>The Pitcairn Islands, a group of islands in the southern Pacific Ocean, are the last remaining British Overseas Territory in Oceania. Settled by mutineers from the in 1790, the island was effectively sovereign until 1898, when it was annexed by the United Kingdom and placed under the jurisdiction of the governor of Fiji. When Fiji became independent in 1970, Pitcairn Island was placed under the authority of the British high commissioner (ambassador) to New Zealand. In practice, partly due to its isolation, Pitcairn has effectively had internal self-government throughout this period. From 1790 to 1829, the local head of government was known simply as the leader. They had a president from 1832 to 1838, and a magistrate from that time until 1999, except for an eleven-year gap from 1893 to 1904, when the chief official was the president of the Council. In 1999, the magistrate&#x27;s non-judicial functions were transferred to the new office of mayor.

<text>Gandalf was a Finnish melodic death metal band who incorporated elements of traditional hard rock into their sound. Formed in 1993 by drummer (then guitarist) Nalle Österman (later in Shaman, Korpiklaani and Lullacry), guitarist Timo Nyberg and vocalist Jari Hurskainen, with session drummer Mika &quot;Gas Lipstick&quot; Karppinen, who later achieved fame playing with the band HIM. The name Gandalf came from when the founding fans of the band used to refer to Gandalf&#x27;s guitarist as the guitar wizard, Gandalf (from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;). Since then, the band decided to call their band Gandalf. Gandalf released both of their albums through Wicked World Records, a subsidiary of Earache Records.

<doc id="1087729" wikidata="Q5567126" url="?curid=1087729" title="Glass onion">
<text>Glass onions or onion bottles, were a shape of bottle developed and used during the 17th and 18th centuries. With new techniques of glass-making, the bottles marked a move away from ceramic pottery.

==Background==
Onion bottles most commonly were used to hold wine, but were also used for spirits. At the beginning of the 17th-century wine bottles were small and thin-walled, making them difficult to store and ship.

During the 1630s, privateer turned inventor Kenelm Digby teamed up with James Howell, creating a method of making stronger glass with hotter furnaces. Digby owned a glassworks that made bottles which were globular in shape with a high, tapered neck, a collar, and a punt. His manufacturing technique involved a coal furnace, made hotter than usual by the inclusion of a wind tunnel, and a higher ratio of sand to potash and lime than was customary. Digby&#x27;s technique produced wine bottles which were stronger and more stable than most of their day, and protected the contents from light due to their green or brown translucent, rather than clear transparent, color.

These early bottles, usually referred to as &quot;shaft and globe&quot; bottles, evolved into the onion bottle shape by the 1670s. This shape gradually evolved to be stouter with a broad base and short neck by the end of the 17th century, then became elongated during the onset of the 18th century. Onion bottles were dark green or brown from iron oxide found within the sand used to make them. The color was further darkened by the coal used to heat the furnaces, leaving the bottles almost black. Collars were applied to the tops for corks to be tied down. When shipped, they would be laid on their sides to soak the cork and help prevent oxidation of the wine. Spirits such as brandy were also added to the wine to extend its life when shipping overseas.

<doc id="1087740" wikidata="Q1305850" url="?curid=1087740" title="Aphthona">
<text>Aphthona is a genus of beetle, in the leaf beetle family Chrysomelidae, native to Europe and Asia. More specifically, &quot;Aphthona&quot; are flea beetles, meaning they have enlarged hind legs for jumping away from potential danger. There are some 300 species known worldwide.

This flea beetle genus is important because of the usefulness of some species in controlling leafy spurge, a major invasive weed in parts of western North America. Several &quot;Aphthona&quot; species have been taken from Europe and introduced into localized areas of the United States and Canada, and some success against the weed is being seen. The six species used for this purpose include &quot;A. abdominalis&quot;, &quot;A. cyparissiae&quot;, &quot;A. czwalinae&quot;, &quot;A. flava&quot;, &quot;A. nigriscutis&quot;, and &quot;A. lacertosa&quot;, though &quot;A. abdominalis&quot; apparently never established a viable population and was never introduced in Canada.

==Effectiveness of control==
Control is generally thought to be effective, but results vary from site to site, which has been attributed to soilborne pathogens, phenology of spring, soil texture, and leafy spurge density. Control is less effective in sandy soils. Control may not be reliably observed and measured for 10 years or more.

<text>Paul Morris Fitts Jr. (May 6, 1912 – May 2, 1965) was an American psychologist. He is known for his work at the Ohio State University, where he conducted research in conjunction with personnel at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, generally recognized as the &quot;birthplace of human factors engineering.&quot; Fitts also later taught at the University of Michigan. He developed a model of human movement, Fitts&#x27;s law, based on rapid, aimed movement, which went on to become one of the most highly successful and well studied mathematical models of human motion.

==Early life and career==

During his time as a lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force, Fitts had improved aviation safety by focusing on human factors in what were called &quot;man-machine operations&quot; in that era. He thus became widely recognized as a pioneer in the emerging multi disciplinary science of human factors engineering.There are also indications Fitts worked in some capacity as a consultant concerning the interview of alleged UFO witnesses, and was planning work on how terrestrial or psychological explanations could account for UFO sightings.

In 1965 he died unexpectedly at the age of 52.He was President of Division 21 (Division of Applied Experimental and Engineering psychology) of the American Psychological Association (APA), in 1957–1958. The association now has a Paul Fitts honorary award. Fitts was also elected a Fellow in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society and served as president the organization in 1962-63 (when it was simply named the Human Factors Society).

== Education ==

He received degrees in psychology at the following universities:
* University of Tennessee (BS 1934)
* Brown University (MS 1936)
* University of Rochester (PhD 1938)

<text>A Wind in the Door is a young adult science fantasy novel by Madeleine L&#x27;Engle. It is a companion book to &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; and part of the Time Quintet.

==Plot==
Fourteen-year-old Meg Murry is worried about her brother Charles Wallace, a 6-year-old genius bullied at school by the other children. The new principal of the elementary school is the former high school principal, Mr. Jenkins, who often disciplined Meg, and Meg is sure he has a grudge against her whole family. Meg tries to enlist Jenkins&#x27;s help in protecting her brother but is unsuccessful. Later, Meg discovers that Charles Wallace has a progressive disease that is leaving him short of breath. Their mother, a microbiologist, suspects a dysfunction of his farandolae, invisible organelles within his mitochondria.

One afternoon, Charles Wallace tells Meg of a &quot;drive of dragons&quot; in their backyard, where he and Meg thereupon discover a pile of unusual feathers. Later, Meg has a frightening encounter with a monstrous facsimile of Mr. Jenkins. That night, Meg, Charles Wallace, and their friend, 16-year-old Calvin O&#x27;Keefe discover that Charles Wallace&#x27;s &quot;drive of dragons&quot; is an extraterrestrial &quot;singular cherubim&quot; named Proginoskes (nicknamed &#x27;Progo&#x27; by Meg), under the tutelage of the immense humanoid &quot;Teacher&quot; Blajeny, who recruits the three children to counteract the Echthroi.

Meg&#x27;s first task, taking place on the next day, is to distinguish the real Mr. Jenkins from two Echthroi doubles, by identification of the (potential) goodness in him despite her personal grudge. The protagonists then learn that Echthroi are destroying Charles Wallace&#x27;s farandolae by persuading them not to root themselves in one place and mature. They travel inside one of his mitochondria to persuade a larval farandola, named Sporos, to accept its role as a mature fara. In the process, Meg is nearly annihilated (or &quot;Xed&quot;), and Mr. Jenkins is invaded by his Echthros doubles; whereafter Proginoskes sacrifices himself to &quot;fill in&quot; the emptiness of the Echthroi, and Charles Wallace is saved.

==Characters==
Meg Murry is a high school student, a defensive misfit who gets along best with her family and her friend Calvin O&#x27;Keefe. She wears glasses, has brown hair, and initially considers herself &quot;repulsive-looking&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot;, although she is quite good at math.

Charles Wallace Murry is written as being extremely intelligent, wise, and telepathic. Charles Wallace is bullied by fellow children and misunderstood by adults outside his family. He recognizes that this is a problem he must solve himself. Charles has blue eyes, and is said to be small for his age. 

Calvin O&#x27;Keefe tall, orange hair, freckles and blue eyes, and is a popular boy on the basketball team. However, he did not feel that anyone understands or cares about him until he became friends with the Murry family. He is the third eldest child of Paddy and Branwen O&#x27;Keefe, who have eleven children and are seemingly neglectful of all of them. Calvin considers himself a biological &quot;sport&quot; and different from the rest of his family. 

Proginoskes, is a &quot;singular cherubim&quot; ; he becomes a particular friend of Meg&#x27;s. &quot;Progo&quot; has what seems like hundreds of constantly moving wings, a great quantity and variety of eyes, and is constantly emitting jets of flame and smoke. He does not always take material form, and even when he does, as he tells Meg, not everyone is able to see him. Like Meg, Proginoskes is a Namer, and once learned the names of all the stars. The character&#x27;s name means &quot;foreknowledge&quot;. He teaches and helps Meg kythe, which is best described as an advanced form of telepathy.

==Story development==
The novel grew out of a short story, &quot;Intergalactic P.S. 3&quot;, first published as a pamphlet for Children&#x27;s Book Week in 1970. In this early version of the narrative, Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which from &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; send Charles Wallace, Meg and Calvin to a school on another planet, where Proginoskes and a conifer seed version of Sporos are among their classmates. As in the novel, Meg must identify the real Mr. Jenkins among his two impostors. If she fails, it will be &quot;a victory for the Dark Shadow&quot; (i.e. the Black Thing).

In &quot;Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art&quot;, L&#x27;Engle states that at one stage in the writing of &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot;, she knew who most of the characters would be, including Progo, the snake and &quot;the three Mr. Jenkinses.&quot; She had difficulty developing the story, however, until a physician friend gave her two articles about mitochondria. &quot;And there was where the story wanted me to go,&quot; L&#x27;Engle writes, &quot;away from the macrocosm and into the microcosm.&quot; Enlisting the help of her elder daughter, she proceeded to give herself &quot;a crash course in cellular biology,&quot; which she found to be hard work, but also a lot of fun.

==Reception==
At the time of the book&#x27;s publication, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said, &quot;The audacity of Mrs. L&#x27;Engle&#x27;s mytho-scientific imagination and her undoubted storytelling abilities keep the reader involved in Meg&#x27;s quest, but one wonders whether its chief appeal doesn&#x27;t lie in the all too natural desire to believe that our difficulties, like the Murrys&#x27;, are personal attacks by the forces of cosmic evil... Unfortunately, Meg learns to love the universe with unconvincing ease, and L&#x27;Engle seems to be straining unusually hard to relate what&#x27;s wrong with America to the double-talk phenomenon of mitochondria and farandolae.&quot; Michele Murray wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Madeleine L&#x27;Engle mixes classical theology, contemporary family life, and futuristic science fiction to make a completely convincing tale that should put under its spell both readers familiar with the Murrys and those meeting them for the first time.&quot; In a 2012 essay for &quot;Tor.com&quot;, American author and critic Mari Ness wrote, &quot;This is L&#x27;Engle at the height of her poetic powers, and the failure of this book to receive the same attention and fame as its predecessor is a genuine shame.&quot;

==Audio adaptation==
A Listening Library edition on four audio cassettes, unabridged and read by the author, was issued in 1994. In January 2012, Listening Library released an audio CD version narrated by actress Jennifer Ehle.
