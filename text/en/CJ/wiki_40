==History==

===Puranic traditions===


Dwarka is considered as the first capital of Gujarat. The name literally means gateway. Dwarka has also been referred to throughout its history as &quot;Mokshapuri&quot;, &quot;Dwarkamati&quot;, and &quot;Dwarkavati&quot;. It is mentioned in the ancient epic period of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. According to legend, Krishna settled here after he defeated and killed his uncle Kamsa at Mathura. This mythological account of Krishna&#x27;s migration to Dwarka from Mathura is closely associated with the culture of Gujarat. Krishna is also said to have reclaimed 12 yojanas or of land from the sea to create Dwarka.

Archaeological findings suggest the original temple Dwarkadhish Temple dedicated to Krishna was built in 200 BCE at the earliest. The temple was rebuilt and enlarged in the 15th–16th century. The temple is also the location of Dwaraka maţha, also called &quot;Sharada Matha/Peeth&quot; and &quot;western peeth&quot;, one of the four &quot;peeths&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;religious center&quot;) established by Adi Shankaracharya. As an important pilgrimage centre for Hindus, Dwarka has several notable temples, including Rukmini Devi Temple, Gomti Ghat, and Bet Dwarka. There is also a lighthouse at the land end point of Dwarka.

===Archaeology===
Archaeological investigations at Dwarka, both on shore and offshore in the Arabian Sea, have been performed by the Archaeological Survey of India. The first investigations carried out on land in 1963 revealed many artefacts. Excavations done at two sites on the seaward side of Dwarka brought to light submerged settlements, a large stone-built jetty, and triangular stone anchors with three holes. The settlements are in the form of exterior and interior walls, and fort bastions. From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an ancient port. Another excavation near Dwarkadhish temple took place which have yielded a shrine dedicated to Vishnu from 9th century CE, furthermore excavation were conducted which yielded a settlement from 1st century BCE another excavation was conducted in the site for the antiquity of the town, have yielded a settlement probably contemporary to Mahabharata dated around 2nd millennium BCE.

Dwarka is mentioned in the copper inscription dated 574 CE of Simhaditya, the Maitraka dynasty minister of Vallabhi. He was the son of Varahdas, the king of Dwarka. The nearby Bet Dwarka island is a religious pilgrimage site and an important archaeological site of the Late Harappan period, with one thermoluminescence date of 1570 BCE.

The ASI&#x27;s Underwater Archaeology Wing launched a fresh exploration exercise off the coast of Gujarat at Dwarka. The renewed attempt, after two decades, is to study and preserve cultural heritage in the depths of the Arabian Sea.

===Early history===
An epigraphic reference ascribed to Garulaka Simhaditya, the son of Varahdas, the king of Dwarka, is inscribed on a copper plate dated to 574 CE, found in Palitana. The Greek writer of the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; referred to a place called Baraca, which has been interpreted as present-day Dwarka. A reference made in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; identified Barake as an island in the Gulf of Kanthils, which has also been inferred to mean Dwarka.

One of the four dhams (religious seats), which were founded by Adi Shankaracharya (686–717 CE) at the four corners of the country, was established as a monastic centre and it forms part of the Dwarka temple complex.

===Middle Ages to present===

In 1473 the Gujarat Sultan Mahmud Begada sacked the town and destroyed the temple of Dwarka. The Jagat Mandir or the Dwarakadhisa temple was later rebuilt. Vallabha Acharya retrieved an idol of Dwarkadhish, which was revered by Rukmini. He hid it in a stepwell, known as Savitri vav, during the Muslim invasion, before moving it to Ladva village. In 1551, when Turk Aziz invaded Dwarka, the idol was shifted to the island of Bet Dwarka.
Dwarka, along with the Okhamandal region, was under the rule of Gaekwad of Baroda state during the Indian rebellion of 1857. A war broke out at Okhamandal in 1858 between the local Vaghers and the British. The Vaghers had won the battle and ruled until September 1859. Later, after a joint offensive of the British, the Gaekwads, and other princely state troops, the Vaghers were ousted in 1859. During these operations, led by Colonel Donovan, the temples at Dwarka and Bet Dwarka suffered damage and were looted. A complaint of atrocities by the British was made by the local people of Jamnagar, Porbander, and Kutch, which led to their restoration. In 1861, Dwarakadheesh Temple was renovated by Maharaja Khanderao and the British, who refurbished the shikara. Maharaja Gaikwad of Baroda added a golden pinnacle to the shikara in 1958 during a refurbishment by Shankaracharya of Dwarka. Since 1960, the temple has been maintained by the Government of India.

The Sudama Setu, a bridge over the Gomti River connecting mainland Dwarka with Panchkui island was opened in 2016.

===Temples===

Considered a holy city, Dwarka is well known for its temples and as a pilgrimage centre for Hindus. The Dwarakadhisa Temple, also called &quot;Jagat Mandir&quot;, located in the heart of Dwarka, is a Vaishnava temple. It was built by Raja Jagat Singh Rathore, hence it is called Jagat Mandir. The temple, facing west, is at an elevation of above mean sea-level. It is conjectured that this temple location is 2,500 years old and is where Krishna built his city and a temple. However, the existing temple is dated to the 16th century. It is a five-storied edifice built over 72 pillars (a sandstone temple with 60 pillars is also mentioned). The temple spire rises to a height of , and a very large flag with symbols of the sun and moon is hoisted on it. The temple layout consists of a garbhagriha (&quot;Nijamandira&quot; or &quot;Harigraha&quot;) and an antarala (an antechamber). The main deity deified in the sanctum is Dwarkadeesh, which is known as the Trivikrama form of Vishnu and is depicted with four arms.

The Dwarakadhisa Temple is also the location of Dvaraka Pitha, also called &quot;Sharada Matha/Peeth&quot; and &quot;western peeth&quot;), one of the four peeths (Sanskrit: &quot;religious center&quot;) established by Adi Shankaracharya.

Gomti Ghat consists of steps leading to the Gomti River, which is also a holy place for pilgrims to take a dip in the river, before visiting Dwarakadish temple. The ghat has a number of small shrines dedicated to the Samudra (God of the Sea), Saraswati and Lakshmi. Other notable temples in the ghat area include the Samudra Narayana (Sangam Narayana) temple, which is at the confluence of the Gomti River with the sea, the Chakra Narayana temple where there is a stone with an imprint of a chakra as a manifestation of Vishnu, and the Gomati temple, which has an idol of the river goddess Gomati that is said to have been brought to earth by the sage Vasishta.

The Rukmini Devi Temple, dedicated to Rukmini, Krishna&#x27;s chief queen, is located away from Dwarka. The temple is said to be 2,500 years old, but in its present form it is estimated to belong to the 12th century. It is a richly carved temple decorated with sculptures of gods and goddesses on the exterior with the sanctum housing the main image of Rukmini. Carved &quot;naratharas&quot; (human figures) and carved &quot;gajatharas&quot; (elephants) are depicted in panels at the base of the tower.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration , to an engraving of William Purser&#x27;s painting shown above (painting of the late 1820s), says little of the temples themselves but does advocate and praise religious tolerance. It was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837.

===Bet Dwarka===
Bet Dwarka, an island in the Arabian sea off the coast of Dwarka. Considered the original residence of Krishna, Bet Dwarka was the old port during the ancient times of Krishna before the Okha port was developed in Dwarka. The temple built here is credited to the religious Guru Vallabhacharya of the &quot;Pushtimarg Sampradaya&quot;. Rice is the traditional offering here to the deity as it is believed that Sudama offered rice to his childhood friend Krishna. There are also smaller shrines on Bet Dwarka which are dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, Hanuman and Devi. According to a legend, Vishnu killed the demon Shankhasura on this island. There are temples of Vishnu in the incarnation of matsya, or fish. Other shrines here are of Rukmini, Trivikrama, Devaki, Radha, Lakshmi, Satyabhama, Jambavati, Lakshmi Narayan, and many other gods.

<text>Real Communist Party of India (alt. Realist Communist Party of India) was a political party in India which existed around 1991. Most probably it was a splinter group of Revolutionary Communist Party of India. The party ran in state assembly elections in West Bengal and Assam 1991. In the constituency Santipur, West Bengal the party candidate Asim Ghosh got 54 666 votes (42,79%), but was defeated by the Indian National Congress candidate Ajoy Dey. Ghosh had the support of the Left Front.

In Assam the party candidate Hali Rabha 488 votes (0,73%) in the constituency Chaygaon and in Jonay the party candidate Ayodhya Kumar Pegu got 564 votes (0,72%).

What then happened to the party is unclear, but most probably it was reunited with Revolutionary Communist Party of India (Asim Ghosh represented Revolutionary Communist Party of India in Santipur in the assembly elections 2001).

<text>Paul Häberlin (17 February 1878, Kesswil – 29 September 1960, Basel) was a Swiss philosopher who at different times in his career took the standpoint that either religion or theoretical knowledge was the answer to human problems. He always gave philosophy an important role, but religion was to him the only way man could understand his real position in existence. Häberlin made contributions to characterology and psychotherapy, and was especially successful in treating psychopathic youth and teens. Made a full professor of philosophy, psychology and pedagogics at the University of Basel.

<doc id="1093399" wikidata="Q1224367" url="?curid=1093399" title="Differential pulse-code modulation">
<text>Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) is a signal encoder that uses the baseline of pulse-code modulation (PCM) but adds some functionalities based on the prediction of the samples of the signal. The input can be an analog signal or a digital signal.

If the input is a continuous-time analog signal, it needs to be sampled first so that a discrete-time signal is the input to the DPCM encoder.
* Option 1: take the values of two consecutive samples; if they are analog samples, quantize them; calculate the difference between the first one and the next; the output is the difference.
* Option 2: instead of taking a difference relative to a previous input sample, take the difference relative to the output of a local model of the decoder process; in this option, the difference can be quantized, which allows a good way to incorporate a controlled loss in the encoding.

Applying one of these two processes, short-term redundancy (positive correlation of nearby values) of the signal is eliminated; compression ratios on the order of 2 to 4 can be achieved if differences are subsequently entropy coded because the entropy of the difference signal is much smaller than that of the original discrete signal treated as independent samples.

DPCM was invented by C. Chapin Cutler at Bell Labs in 1950; his patent includes both methods.

==Option 1: difference between two consecutive quantized samples==
The encoder performs the function of differentiation; a quantizer precedes the differencing of adjacent quantized samples; the decoder is an accumulator, which if correctly initialized exactly recovers the quantized signal.

==Option 2: analysis by synthesis==
The incorporation of the decoder inside the encoder allows quantization of the differences, including nonlinear quantization, in the encoder, as long as an approximate inverse quantizer is used appropriately in the receiver. When the quantizer is uniform, the decoder regenerates the differences implicitly, as in this simple diagram that Cutler showed:

<text>The Droitwich Canal is a synthesis of two canals in Worcestershire, England; the Droitwich Barge Canal and the Droitwich Junction Canal. The Barge Canal is a broad canal which opened in 1771 linking Droitwich Spa to the River Severn at Hawford Bottom Lock, Claines. The Droitwich Junction Canal is a narrow canal, opened in 1854, which linked Droitwich to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. Both were built to carry salt, and were abandoned in 1939. They have been the subject of a restoration plan since 1973, and the Barge Canal was officially reopened in 2010, while the Junction Canal reopened in July 2011. Following the opening of the canal, ownership transferred to the newly created Canal and River Trust

==History==
Droitwich has been an important centre for the production of salt, obtained from natural brine springs, since before Roman times. In order to get the product to market, an act of Parliament (the Rivers Stour and Salwarpe Navigation Act 1662) was obtained in 1662 to authorise improvements to the River Salwarpe, but the work was not completed, being abandoned in 1675. The improvements involved six locks on the river, of which five had been built when the scheme failed. Another act of Parliament, obtained in the 1670s, authorised improvements to the Salwarpe and the River Stour, and although the promoters spent £4,000 on the scheme, another bill was put before Parliament in 1693, and a fourth attempt was made in 1703, but this was opposed by owners of the salt works. In 1747, Simon Wood again proposed making the river navigable, and in 1755 there was a scheme to construct a pipeline to carry the brine to Hawford on the River Severn, but both schemes foundered.

With salt production increasing, Droitwich Council asked James Brindley the canal engineer responsible for the Bridgewater Canal to survey a route from the town to the River Severn. This he did in 1767, and the following year an act of Parliament, the Hawford-Droitwich Canal Act 1768, was obtained to authorise the construction. This created &quot;The Company of Proprietors of the Droitwich Canal Navigation&quot;, who had powers to raise £33,400 by issuing shares, and an additional £20,000 if required. Although Brindley was officially &quot;Inspector of the Works&quot;, he was busy building the Trent and Mersey Canal at the time, and so the contractor responsible for building the locks was sent by John Priddey, the resident engineer, to work with and be taught by Brindley. A working capital of £13,400 was raised by issuing 134 shares, mostly bought by local people, and construction started on 27 June 1768. As work proceeded, a further 66 shares were issued, raising another £6,600, and a loan of £3,500 was taken out, making the total cost of the project £23,500.
The canal was constructed as a broad canal, capable of taking Severn Trows which were wide and long. Like most of Brindley&#x27;s canals, it was a contour canal, following the contours as much as possible, to reduce the number of embankments and cuttings required, although there was an awkward bend near Salwarpe church, as the obvious route to the north of the building was specifically excluded by the act of Parliament. The canal was long, and included eight locks, with a total fall of . Because of the presence of brine springs, the water was salty, and did not support populations of fresh-water fish.

The official opening was on 12 March 1771, and the canal was a commercial success. The first dividend was paid in 1775 and by 1777 the £100 shares were trading at £160. A proposal in 1784 to link to the Stourbridge Canal caused disagreement among the shareholders, but the bill to construct the new canal and amalgamate the two companies failed. After the event, the company changed its rules on proxy voting, since it felt that some of those who had voted for amalgamation had not been shareholders, and therefore had not upheld the interests of the canal.

===Operation===
With the prospect of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal causing the profitability of the canal to suffer, the company negotiated a clause in the enabling act of Parliament for the new enterprise, that would guarantee a 5 per cent dividend on Droitwich shares. The agreement was made in March 1790, and as dividends had never been as high as 5 per cent, they started to claim the difference immediately, even though the new canal was not yet built. A claim was made every year, although the Worcester and Birmingham eventually declined to make payments, on the basis that the Droitwich was not encouraging trade sufficiently. The case went to court in 1808, and they had to pay. By November 1810, the Worcester and Birmingham took over the management of the canal, although little seems to have changed, for after an amalgamation attempt in 1821, which was abandoned when the landowner, Lord Somers, objected, the Droitwich company noted that the Worcester and Birmingham had often attempted to meddle in the management of the canal. The repeal of a tax on salt in 1822 and 1825 resulted in the company being able to pay 5 per cent dividends from the late 1820s out of revenue, and only a few claims to honour the guarantee were made subsequently.

The fortunes of the canal started to decline after 1830, when a source of brine was discovered at Stoke Prior, a village to the north east of Droitwich. Much of this was carried overland to the Worcester and Birmingham, where it was taken northwards, but tolls for its carriage on the River Severn were also negotiated so that the price of the product in Gloucester and Bristol was competitive with that using the Droitwich Canal. The coming of the railways took further trade away, although it particularly affected salt from Stoke Prior, and in order to eliminate the overland carriage of both salt and coal, an act of Parliament was obtained in 1852 for the construction of the Droitwich Junction Canal, to connect the barge canal to Hanbury Wharf on the Worcester and Birmingham. The company who built it was in theory independent, but the intent was that the Worcester and Birmingham would lease it once it was finished, at a rate which would pay a 5 per cent dividend. They also leased the barge canal from 1853 for 21 years.

In order to make it easier to compete with the railways, the locks on the barge canal were lengthened, so that coal could be carried up the River Severn and through both canals without having to be transhipped to shorter boats. This work was completed by mid-1854, and the Junction Canal was opened in late 1854. Built as a narrow canal, suitable for boats which were wide, it was one of the last canals to be built in the Canal Mania era. It was long and included another six locks, the final one of which connected the canal to the River Salwarpe. After on the river, the original sluice through which the barge canal was supplied with water had been converted to a wide lock, which enabled boats from the barge canal to use the river to reach a salt works situated above Chapel Bridge. The Barge Lock was , and had four sets of gates, so that it could be used whatever the level of the river. Subsidence beneath it was a problem, as it had to be rebuilt in 1875/6 and 1903, the first time to raise it by and the second to raise it another . The main cargo on both canals was always salt.

===Decline===
With their financial position worsening, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal received an offer from three railway contractors to buy the canal and the Junction Canal, to convert them into railways. The canal company accepted the offer, but when a bill was submitted to Parliament in 1866, it was defeated, as was a second attempt the following year. In September 1873, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal received an offer from the Sharpness New Docks Company to take over the canal and both Droitwich Canals. An act of Parliament was obtained to authorise the takeover in 1874, and the new company became the Sharpness New Docks &amp; Gloucester &amp; Birmingham Navigation Company. They set to work improving the Worcester and Birmingham route, but soon realised that the canal was not profitable. Despite this, they dredged 73,000 tons of mud from the Droitwich Canals in 1881, and altered the upper cills of the locks in 1888-9, to give a navigable depth of . The locks were then , and could accommodate boats of 115 tons. By 1906, the costs of maintenance on both canals exceeded the income, and they gradually decayed. Finally, an act of Parliament authorising abandonment was obtained in July 1939. The last boat to use the barge canal had done so in 1916, while the Junction Canal had not seen any traffic since 1928.

==Restoration==
The problem of what to do with the canals was regularly debated by Droitwich Borough Council in 1963, and a campaign for their restoration was started by Max Sinclair, who suggested that restoration could be completed in under two years. The council realised the potential amenity value of the canal, and the concept was aired in the &quot;Worcester Evening News&quot;, which carried an illustrated article on 14 June 1966. A restoration group was formed in 1969, as part of a national drive by the Inland Waterways Association called &quot;Safeguarding Britain&#x27;s Waterways&quot;, which led to the formation in 1973 of the Droitwich Canals Trust, a limited company with local authority support, which began to work towards the restoration of the canal. On 27–28 October 1973 The Droitwich Dig, organized by the Waterway Recovery Group, gathered together the largest number of volunteers then ever assembled at a restoration site. In 1975, the canal was one of thirteen to benefit from the Job Creation Scheme, set up by the Manpower Services Commission, which provided paid workers to work on restoration and maintenance.

Funding came from various sources. These included £200,000 from Wychavon District Council in 1980, which funded work in Vines Park, including a mooring basin, while a new swing bridge was funded by an award from Shell. The following year, the Manpower Services Commission provided 15 workers with a budget of £19,000 for materials. The section of the barge canal through Vines Park was opened in October 1986, enabling the Trust&#x27;s trip-boat to provide longer trips. An engineering feasibility study was carried out in 1994, which concluded that restoration was certainly possible, and would bring with it economic benefits to the region. It was presented to a packed meeting, at which the problems of passing beneath the A449 at Hawford and of ensuring an adequate water supply were identified. The scheme had the support of the local authorities, who were keen to identify sources of funding, without which the restoration was unlikely to be completed.

In 2002, British Waterways held their &quot;Unlocked and Unlimited&quot; conference, which identified that completion of the Droitwich scheme would require some £9.5 million. Two years later, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £4.6 million for the project, with other funding provided by Advantage West Midlands and the local councils. As part of this, British Waterways took over the lease of the canals from the Droitwich Canal Trust. A planning application for the restoration was submitted by British Waterways on behalf of the Droitwich Canals Restoration Partnership in April 2007, by which time a total of £10.5 million had been promised, some of which was dependent on match funding, and the Restoration Partnership needed to raise £1 million in order to release the other funding.
The project was planned to take two years, with both of the Droitwich Canals completely restored and reopened in 2009. Although the majority of the length of the canals was still in existence, a stretch between the M5 motorway and Hanbury Locks had to be completely rebuilt. The existing culvert for the Body Brook has been used to allow the canal to pass under the motorway.

The Barge Canal and the Junction Canal have been connected together by canalising a stretch of the River Salwarpe through the centre of Droitwich. The course of the river has been made wider and deeper, and a weir has been constructed adjacent to the new lock 7, to maintain the water levels. In order to minimise the mixing of canal water with river water, a pipeline has been built under the towpath, running from just above lock 7 to just below the Barge Lock. The river improvements were to be partially funded by a Section 106 agreement, as part of a housing development along the river bank, but the withdrawal of the developer from the scheme resulted in delays, which put back the full opening of the canal. The Droitwich Barge Canal opened officially on 11 September 2010, and the whole canal was completed by mid-2011, with the official opening held on 1 July.

<text>George S. Griggs (1805-1870) was a pioneer master mechanic in the earliest days of railroading in the United States.

Griggs, like other mechanics of his age, learned the art of machining at Locks and Canals Machine Shop. In 1834 the Boston and Providence (B&amp;P) railroad hired Griggs as their master mechanic, where he spent the remainder of his career.

1845 saw Griggs building his first locomotive, a 4-4-0 named &quot;Norfolk&quot;, at the railroad shops where he worked in Roxbury. Griggs oversaw the construction of nearly twenty more locomotives that used designs and technology from &quot;Norfolk&quot;.
While employed at the railroad, Griggs filed several patents of his own design for items as varied as brake systems, driving wheels, and the firebrick arch. His designs were so successful that the B&amp;P continued building locomotives to his designs for a few years after his death in 1870.

<text>A bread making machine or breadmaker or Bread Maker is a home appliance for baking bread. It consists of a bread pan (or &quot;tin&quot;), at the bottom of which are one or more built-in paddles, mounted in the center of a small special-purpose oven. The machine is usually controlled by a built-in computer using settings input via a control panel. Most bread machines have different cycles for different kinds of dough—including white bread, whole grain, European-style (sometimes labelled &quot;French&quot;), and dough-only (for pizza dough and shaped loaves to be baked in a conventional oven). Many also have a timer to allow the bread machine to function without operator input, and some high-end models allow the user to program a custom cycle.

== History ==

Although bread machines for mass production had been previously made for industrial use, the first self-contained breadmaker for household use was released in Japan in 1986 by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. (now Panasonic) based on research by project engineers and software developer Ikuko Tanaka, who trained with the head baker at Osaka International Hotel to learn how to optimally knead bread; this machine had special ribs inside it.

A decade later the machines had become popular in the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. While not viable for commercial use due to the fixed loaf shape and the limited duty cycle, bread machines are suitable for home use, producing their best results when dealing with kneaded doughs.

== Use and features ==

To create a loaf of bread, ingredients are measured into the bread pan in a specified order (usually liquids first, with solid ingredients layered on top) and the pan is then placed in the breadmaker. The order of ingredients is important because the instant yeast used in bread machines is activated by contact with water, so the yeast and the water must be kept apart until the program starts.

The machine takes a few hours to make a loaf of bread. The ingredients are first rested and brought up to optimal temperature. The ingredients are then turned into a dough by stirring with a paddle. The dough is then proofed using temperature control and then baked.

Once the bread has been baked, the pan is removed from the breadmaker. The shape of the finished loaf is often considered unusual, with many early bread machines producing a vertically oriented, square or cylindrical loaf very different from commercial breads; however, more recent units generally have a more traditional-appearing horizontal pan. Some bread machines use the standard rectangle shape using two paddles. One Zojirushi model has a heating element in the lid to brown the crust.

Bread machine recipes are often somewhat smaller than standard bread recipes, and are sometimes standardized based on the capacity of the machine&#x27;s pan; most common in the United States market are 1.5 lb/700 g units, and the majority of recipes are written for that capacity; however, 2 lb/900 g units are not uncommon. Packaged bread mixes are available, specifically designed for breadmakers, containing premeasured ingredients including flour and yeast, as well as flavorings and occasionally dough conditioners. Only water usually needs to be added. Bread machines generally do not deal well with non-wheat flours, so any recipe that requires a substantial addition of a grain such as rye or corn that lacks gluten will prove difficult at best in a bread machine, as will any dough with unusually large amounts of liquid (such as ciabatta).

Generally, homemade bread goes stale faster than bread from a commercial baker because the former does not include preservatives. However, it is possible (though a bit more difficult) to use a natural leaven or a pre-ferment in breadmaker dough recipes if the starter is sufficiently fast to rise. Sourdough contains a symbiotic culture of yeast and &quot;Lactobacteria&quot;; the yeast provides some flavor as well as carbon dioxide to provide lift, while lactic acid produced by sourdough&#x27;s lactobacteria greatly preserves bread, as well as affecting its flavor, while pre-ferments provide some of the same benefits as a sourdough culture with the greater predictability of domesticated baker&#x27;s yeast.

Breadmakers are often equipped with a timer to control when the breadmaking begins. This allows them, for example, to be loaded in the evening but only begin baking early in the morning, to produce a freshly baked loaf for breakfast. They can also be set only to make dough, for instance to be used to make pizza. Some can also be set to make other things besides bread, such as jam, pasta dough, udon or mochi, a kind of Japanese rice cake. One of the most recent innovations is the facility to add nuts and fruit during the kneading process automatically from a tray.

Traditionally, breadmakers take between three and four hours to bake a loaf. However recently &quot;fast bake&quot; modes have become common additions, many of which are able to produce a loaf in under an hour.

Some breadmakers sold in the 1990s had vertical pans, some horizontal. Today, the vast majority available retail make horizontal loaves. For that reason, they produce a smaller, shorter loaf than their predecessors. It is more difficult to mix a long, horizontal loaf because the ends are distant from the mixer-paddle and gravity does not assist the distribution of the dough. Some machines attempt a better kneading by using two paddles, one at each end. The vertical loaf machine may require a higher powered motor, because the entire mass of the dough-ball is on the paddle as it kneads the dough against the nearby sides of the loaf pan.

<text>Palazzolo sull&#x27;Oglio (Brescian and Bergamasque: ; locally ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the Province of Brescia, in the region of Lombardy in northern Italy. It is located south of Lake Iseo, bordering the Province of Bergamo, and has a population of 20,208. It is the fifth largest city in the Province, after Brescia, Desenzano del Garda, Montichiari and Lumezzane.
==History==
The town was founded on the banks of the river Oglio. The first references to the name &quot;Palazzolo&quot; date to 830 AD. Palazzolo was a fundamental industrial centre of Italy at the end of the 19th century (Marzoli, Lanfranchi, Italcementi, Ferrari) and the city was known as the small Italian Manchester. On 24 August 1954, the town was celebrated as a city with a presidential decree. The &quot;Tower of the People&quot;, the symbol of the city, was built between 1813 and 1830 and today is the highest round tower in Italy, 85 metres high and 7 metres of statue on top. The Roman bridge, in the city centre, is the oldest building of Palazzolo, dating back to the 4th century.

==Main sights==
* The Tower of the People (&quot;Torre del Popolo&quot;).
* The Castle.
* The Roman Bridge.
* The Ancient Pieve (&quot;Antica Pieve&quot;).
* The cathedral (&quot;Chiesa di Santa Maria Assunta&quot;).
* The three Kupfer villas (&quot;Le ville Kupfer&quot;).
==Transport==
From Palazzolo, it is very easy to get to the main cities and towns throughout Italy. The train station is not far from the centre and operates on the Bergamo–Brescia railway. Milan and Venice can be reached by train changing in Bergamo or in Brescia. The A4 motorway, an important Italian route, has an exit called Palazzolo, which is actually in the north of the town. The nearest International Airport is Orio al Serio International Airport, just 15 minutes by car.

==Sports==
Founded in 1913, the football association for the town is Associazione Calcio Palazzolo (Palazzolo Football Association). They play in the local stadium, &quot;Stadio Comunale&quot;, which holds up to 4,500 people.

<text>Vladimir Bakarić (; 8 March 1912 – 16 January 1983) was a Yugoslav and Croatian communist revolutionary and a politician.

==Political career==
Bakarić helped to organise the partisan resistance in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II. From 1948 to 1969, he was the chairman of the League of Communists of Croatia and as such was a close collaborator of President Josip Broz Tito. Even after stepping down from the top post in communist hierarchy in the Socialist Republic of Croatia, he retained much influence and was even considered to be the most influential politician in Croatia.

From 1964 to 1974, he was a member of the Council of the Federation, and since 1974 he has been a member of the Presidency of the SFRY, where he served as vice president from May 15, 1975, to May 15, 1976, and was re-elected to that position in May 1982.

Together with Edvard Kardelj, he belonged to the more liberal wing of the Yugoslav political elite and was known for his statement on the need to &quot;federate the federation&quot; (&quot;federiranje federacije&quot;), a reference to the struggle between Yugoslav unitarists, who advocated giving more powers to the central government, and federalists, who wanted to shift power to the republics. However, Bakarić was usually extremely careful in his public pronouncements on policy and wary of radical statements.

<doc id="1093428" wikidata="Q5589245" url="?curid=1093428" title="Government of Maryland">
<text>The government of Maryland is conducted according to the Maryland Constitution. The United States is a federation; consequently, the government of Maryland, like the other 49 state governments, has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state&#x27;s borders, except as limited by the Constitution of the United States.

Administrative influence in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. Unlike most other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland&#x27;s counties.

Most of the business of government is done in Annapolis, the state capital. However, some cabinet level and state officials have their offices in Baltimore. Almost all state and county elections are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four, in which the President of the United States is &quot;not&quot; elected—this, as in other states, is intended to divide state and federal politics.
==Executive branch==
The constitution establishes five principal executive branch officers, as described below. Four of them are elected statewide: the governor and lieutenant governor (who are elected on the same ticket), the attorney general, and the comptroller. The fifth, the treasurer, is elected by a joint ballot of both houses of the General Assembly.

===Governor===
As in all states, a popularly elected governor heads Maryland&#x27;s executive branch. The governor&#x27;s cabinet is known as the Executive Council. Like most state chief executives, the Maryland governor is elected to serve a four-year term. The governor is term limited to serve no more than two &quot;consecutive&quot; terms. The governor is elected under the plurality system. The current governor is Wes Moore.

The governor has power to veto laws passed by the state&#x27;s legislature and, like most of the nation&#x27;s governors, also has a line item veto, which can be used to strike certain portions of appropriations bills. The state legislature can override a veto by a three-fifths (60%) vote of the total number of members in each house. This is different from most states, which usually require a higher two-thirds (66.66%) vote to override a veto.

The appointment powers of the governor are extensive. The governor appoints almost all military and civil officers of the State subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. In addition to appointing the heads of major departments, boards, and commissions of the State government, the governor appoints certain boards and commissions in each county and the City of Baltimore, as provided for by law. The governor also commissions notaries public and appoints persons to fill vacancies in the offices of Attorney General and Comptroller (both of which are normally elected by the people) and also to fill vacant seats in the General Assembly. The governor can remove any appointed officer (except interim members of the General Assembly) for cause.

The governor is commander-in-chief of the military forces of the State, the Maryland National Guard, except when such forces are called into the national service by the President of the United States, as well as the Maryland Defense Force. In times of public emergency the Governor has certain emergency powers as defined by law.

===Lieutenant governor===

The Maryland Lieutenant Governor is elected on the same ticket as the state&#x27;s Governor and is nominally the second highest-ranking official in the state. The position was first created by the short-lived Maryland Constitution of 1864 and functioned from 1865 to 1868 before being abolished by the state&#x27;s present constitution, which was ratified in 1867. The position was re-established by Constitutional amendment in 1970, under which the Lieutenant Governor &quot;shall have only the duties delegated to him by the Governor.&quot;

The Maryland Lieutenant Governor, currently Aruna Miller, is therefore weaker than the office in most other states which have one (several states do not have one). For instance, in many states, including Texas, the Lieutenant Governor is the President of the State&#x27;s Senate and in California the Lieutenant Governor assumes &quot;all&quot; of the governor&#x27;s powers when the governor is out of the state. In both of those states, as in some others, the Lieutenant Governor is elected in his or her own right, independently of the state&#x27;s Governor.

In practice, Maryland&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor attends cabinet meetings, chairs various task forces and commissions, represents the state at ceremonial functions and at events which the Governor cannot attend, and advises the Governor. If there is a vacancy in the office of the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor becomes the Governor. A vacancy in the Lieutenant Governorship is filled by a person nominated by the Governor and confirmed by a majority vote of the General Assembly voting in joint session.

===Attorney General===
The Attorney General is the chief legal officer of the State and is elected by the people every four years with no term limits. To run for the office a person must be a citizen of and qualified voter in Maryland and must have resided and practiced law in the state for at least ten years. The current attorney general is Anthony G. Brown.

The Attorney General has general charge, supervision and direction of the legal business of the State. The attorney general is the legal advisor and representative of the Governor, the General Assembly, the Judiciary, and the major departments, various boards, commissions, officials and institutions of State Government. The office represents the State in all cases pending in the Appellate Courts of the State, and in the United States Supreme Court and lower Federal Courts. This arrangement can lead to significant conflict when the Attorney General and Governor have strongly differing views.

===Comptroller===
The Comptroller is the state&#x27;s chief financial officer and is also elected by the people for a four-year term. The comptroller is not term-limited. The office was established by the Maryland Constitution of 1851 due to concern about the potential for fraud and corruption in the administration of the public treasury. The constitutional duties of the office begin with the broad mandate to exercise &quot;general superintendence of the fiscal affairs of the State&quot;, which includes collecting taxes and maintaining the general ledger. The Comptroller (or a deputy) countersigns all checks drawn by the State Treasurer upon the deposits of the State. The Comptroller also prescribes the formalities for transfer of other evidence of State debt and countersigns such papers. The current comptroller is Brooke Lierman.

In addition, the comptroller&#x27;s office audits taxpayers for compliance, handles delinquent tax collection, and enforces license and unclaimed property laws. The agency publicizes forgotten bank accounts, insurance benefits and other unclaimed assets of taxpayers. Acting as Maryland&#x27;s chief accountant, the comptroller pays the state&#x27;s bills, maintains its books, prepares financial reports, and pays state employees.

===Treasurer===

The Treasurer, currently Dereck E. Davis, is the principal custodian of the State&#x27;s cash deposits, money from bond sales, and other securities and collateral and directs the investments of those assets. The Treasurer is elected by a joint ballot of both houses of the General Assembly, a tradition begun starting with the Maryland Constitution of 1851, which also created the Board of Public Works (see below).

Because of the close relationship with the General Assembly, the Treasurer briefs the members of the Legislature on matters concerning the State Treasury. The Treasurer is also responsible for producing an annual report to provide the Governor, the General Assembly, and the public with current information about the operations of the State Treasurer&#x27;s Office.

===Board of Public Works===

The State Board of Public Works was first created by the Maryland Constitution of 1864 and is composed of the Governor, who chairs it, the Comptroller, and the Treasurer. The three-member board is quite powerful and there is no other state that has a similar institution. The board, which generally meets twice a month, reviews and approves capital projects, procurement contracts, and the acquisition, use, and transfer of State assets, to assure that executive decisions are made responsibly and responsively.

===Other===
* The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) oversees food safety, consumer protection, farmering, food and fiber processing, and other businesses engaged in agricultural related operations.
* The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) oversees public school districts.
* The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) is the environmental protection agency.
* The Maryland Department of General Services (DGS) manages, operates, and maintains state property and acts as a primary procurement agency.
* The Maryland Department of Health oversees and regulates health-related issues.
* The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) oversees housing policy.
* The Maryland Department of Labor oversees unemployment insurance, occupational and professional licensing, labor regulation, workforce training, financial regulation, and the Maryland Racing Commission.
* The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) maintains natural resources such as state parks, public lands, state forests, state waterways, wildlife and recreation areas.
* The Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) oversees the Maryland Transportation Authority, Maryland Transit Administration, Maryland Port Administration, State Highway Administration, Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, and Maryland Aviation Administration.
* The Maryland State Archives serves as the central depository for government records of permanent value.

==Legislative branch==

The state&#x27;s legislative branch is styled as the General Assembly and consists of a 47-member Senate and a 141-member House of Delegates. It meets each year for 90 days to act on more than 2300 bills including the State&#x27;s annual budget. Like the governor, members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.

The current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial U.S. Census. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. Some of the larger districts are divided into delegate subdistricts to provide local representation to areas not large enough to constitute an entire legislative district.

The Senate is led by a President and the House by a Speaker whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing.

==Judicial branch==

===Supreme Court===

The Supreme Court of Maryland is the highest court in the state. In addition to being the court of last resort for the state, the Supreme Court also administers and sets rules and guidelines for the state&#x27;s court system. It has original jurisdiction in only a few areas and hears most cases on appeal. Prior to 2022, the Supreme Court was named the Court of Appeals, but a 2022 constitutional amendment changed the title to its current name. The court has seven judges, one from each of the state&#x27;s seven appellate judicial circuits, which are presently as follows:

*1st Appellate Judicial Circuit: Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne&#x27;s, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico &amp; Worcester counties
*2nd Appellate Judicial Circuit: Baltimore County &amp; Harford County
*3rd Appellate Judicial Circuit: Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard &amp; Washington counties
*4th Appellate Judicial Circuit: Prince George&#x27;s County
*5th Appellate Judicial Circuit: Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles &amp; St. Mary&#x27;s counties
*6th Appellate Judicial Circuit: Baltimore
*7th Appellate Judicial Circuit: Montgomery County

===Appellate Court===
To ease the caseload of the Supreme Court, the state&#x27;s second-highest court, the Appellate Court was created in 1966, following a constitutional amendment. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Appellate Court has exclusive initial appellate jurisdiction over any reviewable judgment, decree, order, or other action of a circuit court or an orphans&#x27; court, except for appeals in criminal cases in which the death penalty is imposed. Generally, it hears cases appealed from the circuit courts. Prior to 2022, the Appellate Court was named the Court of Special Appeals, but a 2022 constitutional amendment changed the title to its current name.

Judges of the Appellate Court are empowered to sit in panels of three. A hearing or rehearing of a case &quot;en banc&quot;, in which all of the Court&#x27;s judges sit, may be ordered in any case by a majority of the Court&#x27;s incumbent judges. The court has thirteen judges, one from each of the state&#x27;s seven judicial appellate circuits and six at-large judges.

Judges on both the Supreme Court and the Appellate Court are appointed by the Governor, with the consent of the Senate and the approval of the people, for 10 years. This system is similar to the Missouri Plan, which is used in 11 states to fill judicial appointments, in that voters get to decide whether or not to continue a judge in office. However, it is different in that the Governor&#x27;s choice in whom to appoint is not limited by a Judicial Selection Commission and the State Senate must confirm the nominee before the judge takes office.

===Circuit Courts===
Circuit Courts are the highest common law and equity courts of record exercising original jurisdiction within Maryland. Each has full common law and equity powers and jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases within its county or counties, and all the additional powers and jurisdiction conferred by the Maryland Constitution and by law, except where jurisdiction has been limited or conferred exclusively upon another tribunal by law. The Circuit Courts are trial courts of general jurisdiction. Their jurisdiction is very broad but generally covers major civil cases and more serious criminal matters. Circuit Courts also may decide appeals from the District Court and certain administrative agencies. Cases can be heard by a jury when the amount in controversy is over $15,000. Juries are limited to the Circuit Courts.

The state is divided into eight judicial circuits, which are presently as follows:

*1st Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Dorchester (1 judge), Somerset (1 judge), Wicomico (3 judges) &amp; Worcester (2 judges) counties
*2nd Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Caroline (1 judge), Cecil (3 judges), Kent (1 judge), Queen Anne&#x27;s(1 judge) &amp; Talbot (1 judge) counties
*3rd Judicial Circuit (21 judges): Baltimore County (16 judges) &amp; Harford County (5 judges)
*4th Judicial Circuit (7 judges): Allegany (2 judges), Garrett (1 judge) &amp; Washington (4 judges) counties
*5th Judicial Circuit (18 judges): Anne Arundel (10 judges), Carroll (3 judges) &amp; Howard (5 judges) counties
*6th Judicial Circuit (24 judges): Frederick (4 judges) &amp; Montgomery (20 judges) counties
*7th Judicial Circuit (32 judges): Calvert (2 judges), Charles (4 judges), Prince George&#x27;s (23 judges) &amp; St Mary&#x27;s (3 judges) counties
*8th Judicial Circuit (30 judges): Baltimore

Unlike other state courts, the Circuit Court has no chief judge. Instead, eight circuit administrative judges perform administrative duties in each of their respective circuits. Each Circuit Court judge is appointed by the Governor (without Senate confirmation) for the temporary position until the next election . The judge&#x27;s name is placed on the ballot in the first general election once they qualify and pay the standard filing fee for the vacancy the judge was appointed to fill. The judge may be opposed formally by one or more qualified members of the bar, with the successful candidate that the people have elected to a fifteen-year term.

===District Court===
The Maryland District Court has jurisdiction in minor civil and criminal matters, and in virtually all violations of the Motor Vehicle Law. Created by a constitutional amendment in 1970, the court began operating in July 1971. It replaced the justices of the peace, the county trial magistrates, the People&#x27;s Courts (in certain counties), and various minor courts. With statewide jurisdiction, the Court functions in every county and Baltimore.

The exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court generally includes all landlord and tenant cases; replevin actions; motor vehicle violations; and criminal cases if the penalty is less than three years imprisonment or does not exceed a fine of $2,500, or both. The District Court has concurrent jurisdiction in misdemeanors and certain enumerated felonies, but has little equity jurisdiction. Small claims (civil cases involving amounts not exceeding $5,000) also come under the jurisdiction of the District Court. In civil cases involving amounts over $5,000 (but not exceeding $25,000), the District Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts. Since the District Court provides no juries, a person entitled to and electing a jury trial must proceed to the Circuit Court. However, appeals from the District Court can be heard de novo in the Circuit Court.

District Court judges are appointed by the Governor to ten-year terms, subject to Senate confirmation. Unlike other judges in the state, they do not stand for election. As of October 2003, some 105 judges, including the Chief Judge, who is designated by the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court, serve on the Court. As the District Court&#x27;s administrative head, its Chief Judge appoints administrative judges for each of the twelve districts, subject to the approval of the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court. Administered centrally, the District Court of Maryland is funded totally by the State.

The District Court of Maryland is divided into twelve geographical districts as follows:

*District 1 (26 judges): Baltimore
*District 2 (5 judges): Dorchester (1 judge), Somerset (1 judge), Wicomico (2 judges) &amp; Worcester (1 judge) counties
*District 3 (6 judges): Caroline (1 judge), Cecil (2 judges), Kent (1 judge), Queen Anne&#x27;s (1 judge) &amp; Talbot (1 judge) counties
*District 4 (4 judges): Calvert (1 judge), Charles (2 judges) &amp; St. Mary&#x27;s (1 judge) counties
*District 5 (13 judges): Prince George&#x27;s County
*District 6 (11 judges): Montgomery County
*District 7 (8 judges): Anne Arundel County
*District 8 (13 judges): Baltimore County
*District 9 (4 judges): Harford County
*District 10 (7 judges): Carroll (2 judges) &amp; Howard (5 judges) counties
*District 11 (5 judges): Frederick (3 judges) &amp; Washington (2 judges) counties
*District 12 (3 judges): Allegany (2 judges) &amp; Garrett (1 judge) counties

==Local government==
At the local level, Maryland is notable among U.S. states for having a relatively small number of local governments. There are three forms of county government available to the state&#x27;s counties. Note that the independent city of Baltimore is typically considered to be on par with the counties; it is reckoned as a county-equivalent for census purposes. Including Baltimore, there are 157 incorporated cities in Maryland. Maryland has no township or independent school district governments.

===Commissioner counties===
In 1827, the General Assembly authorized elected boards of county commissioners for each county Under the state constitution, the General Assembly retains full authority to legislate for a commissioner county. County commissioners have no authority to act in local matters without the express prior consent of the General Assembly. In the areas where they do have authority to legislate, that authority is narrowly construed; it is limited to areas authorized by the General Assembly, enabling legislation, or public local laws. The Constitution adopted in 1867 kept the power to pass public local laws vested in the General Assembly, which gave a lot of control over county government to county delegations in the General Assembly. As a result of this, the General Assembly spends considerable time dealing with local issues, ordinances, and expenditures.

Currently, six counties are run by commissioners. They are:
Calvert, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary&#x27;s, Somerset, and Washington Counties.

In 2010, the voters of Cecil County adopted a resolution to become a charter county and subsequently elected Tari Moore as the first county executive.

===Charter counties===
Due partly to the large amount of time spent by the state legislature on local matters, the Maryland Constitution was amended in 1915 to allow counties the option of operating under a charter form of government, with substantial home rule power. To adopt this form of government, the voters of the county must approve the charter which their charter board drafts.

Charter counties are governed by an elected county council with power to legislate on almost all local matters. Their authority is fairly broadly construed, though the regulation of elections and the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is reserved to the General Assembly. The General Assembly also retains considerable authority over taxation, except in Baltimore and Montgomery counties. Some counties which operate under charters have a separately-elected county executive while others vest executive functions along with legislative functions in the county council.

Currently, eleven counties, including the most populous ones, operate under the charter form of government. They are: Anne Arundel (1964), Baltimore (1956), Cecil (2012), Dorchester (2002), Frederick (2014), Harford (1972), Howard (1968), Montgomery (1948), Prince George&#x27;s (1970), Talbot (1973), and Wicomico (1964) Counties. Baltimore also operates under a charter.

===Code Home Rule counties===
Due to the reluctance of many counties to adopt a charter form of government, despite wanting a measure of home rule, the Maryland Constitution was again amended in 1966 to create a third class of county government, the &quot;code home rule&quot; status. If two thirds of a county&#x27;s commissioners adopt a resolution that the county become a code county and a majority of the voters approve of the resolution, the county becomes a code county. In a code county, the county commissioners have home-rule powers, and may enact legislation in the areas of the &quot;express powers&quot; of the charter counties. In addition, the commissioners retain all the powers of commissioners in commissioner counties. However, code counties have stricter limits on indebtedness than charter counties. The General Assembly can only legislate for the code counties as a class.

Currently, six counties operate as code counties: Allegany, Caroline, Charles, Kent, Queen Anne&#x27;s, and Worcester Counties.

== Maryland and the national government ==


Maryland was the seventh state to ratify the United States Constitution, on April 28, 1788. Maryland elects two United States Senators and eight members of the United States House of Representatives. The state is served by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (with two divisions, sitting in Baltimore and Greenbelt) and federal appeals from the state go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia.

<doc id="1093429" wikidata="Q7280933" url="?curid=1093429" title="Radio Newyork International">
<text>Radio Newyork International was the name of a pirate radio station which broadcast from a ship anchored in international waters off Long Beach, New York, United States in 1987 and 1988. The history of Radio Newyork International (RNI) is linked with the Falling Star Network and other New York City area pirate radio stations. The owner of RNI, Allan Weiner, is currently the licensee of WBCQ shortwave in Monticello, Maine.

==Brief history==

===John Ford and Allan Weiner===
Allan Weiner of Monticello, Maine, United States, who had been a resident of Yonkers, New York, was a radio engineer who had operated both a licensed radio station and unlicensed transmitters. Eventually his radio license was revoked due to his unlicensed activities. Weiner was also familiar with the new Radio Caroline ship operation and he paid a visit to the ship in an attempt to install a shortwave service. During this visit he met John Hungerford, a US citizen who was a disc jockey on board the vessel under the name of &quot;John Ford&quot;. As a result of this meeting, Weiner, Ford and other associates decided to replicate Radio Caroline as Radio Newyork International from a ship to be anchored in international waters off Long Beach, Long Island, New York.

===Lichfield I===
In 1987 Weiner and his associates came into possession of a vessel still legally registered as &quot;Lichfield I&quot; and owned by the Lichfield Shipping and Trading Company of Panama. This Japanese-built oceangoing fishing ship had originally suffered engine failure off the US coast, and it had been seized by US Customs when illegal drugs were found on board. Over a United States holiday period this vessel was sold to Frank Ganter (an associate of Weiner) for $100 using the amended name of &quot;Litchfield I&quot;, even though the vessel was still registered in Panama to its original owners under its correct name. Through this strange paper trail the vessel eventually came into the physical possession of Weiner, who renamed it yet again as &quot;Sarah&quot; after his ex-wife. Weiner then asked Hungerford to register this vessel under the name of &quot;Sarah&quot; with Honduran Consulate officials in New York. This registration was later considered to be fraudulent, and the Honduran officials deleted their registration.

It was during the brief period when the fraudulent Honduran entry had been created that this Panamanian ship, which lacked a working engine, was transformed into the home of Radio Newyork International by Weiner and Hungerford. While the station was actually called Radio New York International, the name contraction gave Weiner the opportunity to use of the old Radio Northsea International jingles and thus call their station &quot;RNI&quot;. The ship station had several transmitters and a studio on board, and it was towed to its location off Long Island by Frank Ganter using his tugboat the M/V Munzer. It was Ganter who had obtained the vessel from the U.S. Government officials and then sold it to Weiner for $30,000.

When broadcasting began the RNI signals were picked up over half of the United States; the first song they aired, fittingly, was &quot;Come on Down to My Boat&quot; by the 1960s band Every Mother&#x27;s Son. Federal authorities did just that a few days later: they raided the &quot;Sarah&quot; and arrested Weiner, crew member Ivan Rothstein of Brooklyn, NY, and a reporter from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. The trio were brought back to shore, and the station&#x27;s broadcasting equipment was rendered unusable. Soon after, the Honduran Consulate nullified the ship registration when it was brought to their attention that the ship was not functioning as a commercial fishing vessel as its registrants had indicated.

===Sealand===
A federal court case began with a promise by Weiner that he would not broadcast again until the case against him had been heard in court. Weiner then traveled to England to visit a pirate radio convention in Blackpool, England and he was introduced to Michael Bates whose father (Roy Bates) had fought with personnel from Radio Caroline in the 1960s to take physical control of a sea fort which had been the World War II HM Fort Roughs. As a squatter on this disused installation Bates eventually declared it to be a sovereign country in its own right, Sealand. Weiner concluded an agreement with Michael Bates by selling the ship that he called &quot;Sarah&quot; (the real &quot;Lichfield I&quot;) to a British company organized by Bates at the address of his London accountant. In return Weiner claimed that Bates had reregistered the &quot;Sarah&quot; in the principality of Sealand.

===Second US action===
In 1988 the &quot;Sarah&quot; was towed from Boston back to its original anchorage off Long Island and began broadcasting once more. Weiner did not stay aboard this time due to court restrictions. Capt. Josh Hayl and another crew member, Reggie Boles manned the vessel. It was again stopped within days under threat of a new boarding by US authorities. The Sarah remained at its mooring for another twelve weeks, Capt. Josh Hayl waiting for orders to resume broadcasting from Weiner, however shore side legal proceedings could not prevent intervention from the United States Coast Guard.

===Court cases===
Beginning in late 1988, Weiner attempted to get a shortwave broadcasting license for a station which eventually became WBCQ at Monticello, Maine. At about the same time Weiner also entered into a contract to sell the entire radio ship to other buyers. In 1990 Weiner attended FCC Administrative Court hearings concerning both his application for a license and his previous land based and offshore illegal activities.

In preparation for these extensive court hearings the United States asked the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), about the bogus registration of the &quot;Sarah&quot; with the entity that Roy Bates had called &quot;Sealand&quot;. At about the same time Weiner&#x27;s federal court case for illegal broadcasting was also underway. As a part of his defense in that case his attorney cited Radio Caroline as an example of why offshore radio broadcasting was a legal enterprise. At the time of that hearing the new Radio Caroline ship was the host to three broadcasting services: one in the English language, another in the Dutch language and a third on a shortwave service started some time after Weiner&#x27;s visit to the ship.

The shortwave service called World Mission Radio (WMR), advertised on air that its mailing address was in California, United States. On August 19, 1989, the Netherlands and British Radio Regulatory Authorities carried out a joint raid upon the Radio Caroline ship and destroyed or confiscated much of the broadcasting equipment. The authorities claimed that the unlicensed WMR shortwave service on 6215 kHz was causing interference to maritime communications.

During the 1990 Administrative Court hearings, all of these same matters were discussed once more and on the record. James Murphy, an investigator for the Office of Official Solicitor acting on behalf of the DTI who was involved in the raid on Radio Caroline to silence WMR, was also asked to provide a statement for the court about &quot;Sealand&quot;. Murphy performed a sworn document made under the laws of both the UK and the USA. In this document he stated that he was an Investigator for the office of the Official Solicitor acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for the DTI. He stated that he had personally carried out an investigation into the alleged &quot;Principality of Sealand&quot; and he further reported that it was neither a state nor an entity capable of registering ships. The court accepted this finding. At the conclusion of the hearing the Court denied Weiner his license but suggested that if he stayed out of trouble that he could reapply. Weiner appealed this decision and a year later the decision was upheld against him once again.

===HavenCo and Ryan Lackey===
Roy Bates never attempted to challenge the UK government over its findings for the United States court case and neither did he attempt to intervene in that case or file a brief of his own. Because the case was not known to the general public it was not known to US citizen Ryan Lackey when Roy Bates entered into a contract with him to establish the HavenCo internet project on Rough Tower which Bates called &quot;Sealand&quot;. However, it was because this case eventually came to his attention following his own discovery of the controversial claims made by Bates about the state that he claimed to have established, which then caused Ryan Lackey to leave the project.

===Baskir and government raid===
While his US court cases were ongoing, Weiner proceeded to try to sell the bogus &quot;Sarah&quot; to a consortium led by Genie Baskir of Virginia. The reason for the sale and attempted purchase was that Weiner had assured the US courts that he would not attempt to use the ship for offshore broadcasting, while Baskir had plans of her own. The first of these was to use the vessel as the home of Radio Tiananmen to be operated by Chinese students in the United States, and then as the base of ship board studios linked to WWCR in Tennessee for a British company registered in England by Paul Byford as World Wide Community Radio (London), Ltd., and Radlon (Sales), Ltd.

Although Baskir paid Weiner several thousand dollars for the ship and she paid additional funds to the private harbor in Boston where the vessel was berthed, Weiner could not produce a valid paper trail to show that he was the lawful owner of a ship called Sarah. Baskir and her associates then became engaged in a costly process of discovery involving authorities in the UK, USA and Panama, in an attempt to discover who legally owned the vessel. Although Panama eventually confirmed that the vessel was still legally registered by that government as &quot;Lichfield I&quot; for the ship&#x27;s true original owners and Lloyd&#x27;s Registry of Shipping confirmed this information, further legal questions were generated about how the ship had passed from the hands of the US government into the physical possession of Ganter who had then sold the ship to Weiner.

It was during this period of expensive investigation that Weiner entered into a sidebar arrangement with a subsidiary company of MGM, who then blew it up as part of the final scenes in their film &quot;Blown Away&quot;. Before this event had taken place, Weiner transferred the radio broadcasting equipment, including the radio tower to yet another ship which he called &quot;Fury&quot;. Weiner and another associate intended to use this new vessel to broadcast once more under the call sign of RNI. When details of the MGM transaction and the &quot;Fury&quot; transfer became known to Baskir, she promptly assisted the Federal Communications Commission attorney&#x27;s to cause the arrest of the &quot;Fury&quot;, which FCC officials claimed had made a test transmission while still in US waters. The raid instigated by Baskir terminated in the arrest of the &quot;Fury&quot; and all of its transmission equipment. The case history of this matter drew to a close with Baskir having lost her funds and the FCC taking possession of all of the broadcasting equipment and destroying it. As a form of trade-off, the FCC attorney then transferred to Baskir the entire US government case file about the long history of Weiner&#x27;s interaction with the FCC, which included the story of the &quot;Sarah&quot; and &quot;Sealand&quot;. Meanwhile, the legal entanglements caused by Weiner and Bates over the bogus &quot;Sealand&quot; registry created a further financial drain on Baskir&#x27;s UK partner Paul Byford and to date the civil legal issues surrounding the Baskir-Byford loss have never been settled.

===Further attempts===
Although Weiner made further attempts to use ships to restart &quot;Radio Newyork International&quot;, these plans did not succeed. For a time he contracted with licensed US shortwave station WWCR in Tennessee to carry &quot;Radio Newyork International&quot; as a paid program. In 1990 and 1991, there were also RNI programs carried on WRNO and Radio for Peace International.

===WBCQ===
Eventually Allan Weiner did secure a shortwave broadcasting license of his own and today &quot;Radio Newyork International&quot; is one of many programs heard on Sunday evenings over WBCQ located in Monticello, Maine, USA.

Appellants respectfully submit that this ruling creates a dangerous precedent in that it allows the government potentially to reach out and control broadcasters anywhere in the world as long as their broadcasts are able to be picked up somewhere within the borders of the United States. Does the FCC thus have power to shut down all broadcasts from the Caroline, a broadcast vessel moored in the North Sea, based upon a claim that signals from that vessel&#x27;s radio broadcasts were picked up, however briefly and even if creating no interference, somewhere in this country?

:The broadcasts from &quot;World Mission Radio&quot; (WMR) on shortwave that came from the same home as Radio Caroline on board the MV &quot;Ross Revenge&quot; in the North Sea, were audible as far in land as Texas in the USA. WMR maintained a US mailing address in California and portrayed itself as a US broadcasting station in its rate card literature. When the USA requested assistance from the UK to answer this question posed on behalf of Allan Weiner, et al., it was James Murphy who personally went out in his own vessel to supervise the joint Anglo-Dutch raid on the MV &quot;Ross Revenge&quot;. In return, this same James Murphy then issued a sworn statement on behalf of the UK for use by the USA in its case against Weiner concerning the matter of &quot;Sealand&quot;. The Four Freedoms Federation engaged in contact with the FCC, DTI and James Murphy personally about these matters and as a result the Four Freedoms Federation developed a large library of material concerning all of this entire subject.

<text>DBA Luftfahrtgesellschaft mbH, founded as Delta Air and formerly branded as Deutsche BA, was a German low-cost airline headquartered on the grounds of Munich Airport in a building within the municipality of Hallbergmoos, Bavaria, Germany. It operated scheduled domestic and international services and also operated charter flights for tour operators in Europe and North Africa.

It was acquired by Air Berlin in August 2006 when operating as dba, but continued to operate independently, marketed as Air Berlin (powered by dba) until being dissolved by its parent company Air Berlin on 30 November 2008.

==History==
===Foundation by British Airways===

Deutsche BA was established in 1992, when British Airways (BA) acquired a 49% stake in the Friedrichshafen-based regional airline Delta Air. BA acquired the remaining shares in 1997.

When Carl Michel became CEO, the fleet was streamlined to consist entirely of 18 Boeing 737-300 aircraft, dropping secondary routes including those services operated with Saab 2000 as well as other turboprop aircraft types and focusing on internal German routes, feeder services to London–Gatwick and links to other oneworld partners, notably Iberia and Finnair.

Rod Eddington replaced Bob Ayling as British Airways Chief Executive in May 2000, starting major reviews of the airline&#x27;s operations. First indications of a BA review of its German arm came in 2001 at which time Deutsche BA had amassed losses of over £15m. On 3 May 2002 EasyJet announced that it intended to pursue a purchase of former BA subsidiary Go. EasyJet followed with an announcement on 8 May 2002 that it had signed an exclusive agreement with British Airways giving it the option to purchase Deutsche BA. EasyJet had until 31 March 2003, or with an extension until 3 July 2003, to purchase the airline. During this time Deutsche BA would remain fully under BA control. However, EasyJet had several commitments: send three managers to the German operation, contribute £3m for capital expenditure and pay BA £366,000 per month until it exercised its option. In March 2003 EasyJet announced it had abandoned its plans to acquire Deutsche BA, citing the economic climate and employment laws in Germany.

===First sale and planned mergers===

In June 2003, BA announced plans to sell Deutsche BA to Intro Verwaltungsgesellschaft for a token sum of 1 Euro. In addition BA would invest £25m into the airline and guarantee its fleet of 16 Boeing 737s for a year. In return BA would receive 25% of any profits or proceeds from a sale until June 2006. It was rebranded as dba.

In March 2005 dba announced its intention to acquire rival airline Germania Express (gexx) which would create Germany&#x27;s third largest airline after Lufthansa and Air Berlin. The &quot;gexx&quot; brand was phased out on the former airline&#x27;s services, along with its Fokker 100 aircraft which dba has assumed the lease of. dba submitted a binding bid for ailing Greek national airline Olympic Airlines in April 2005, but later withdrew that bid.

In the fiscal year ending 31 March 2005, dba announced its first profit since creation in 1992, of &#x27;between €1m and €2m on sales of around €265m. 3 million passengers flew on dba aircraft in the year ending March 2005. The airline was owned by Intro Verwaltungsgesellschaft (80%) and Martin Gauss and Peter Wojahn (20%), and had 660 employees (at January 2005).

On 17 February 2006, dba announced the purchase of 60% of LTU. Hans-Rudolf Wöhrl, the majority owner of dba, planned to link the operations of LTU and dba, with dba flying inside Germany and LTU serving international destinations. It would allow LTU to increase its longhaul services by providing feeder services to Munich and Düsseldorf. LTU managing director Jürgen Marbach took a 24% stake in the carrier.

===Sale to Air Berlin===

In February 2006 Lutz Helmig acquired a 25.1% stake in the airline through the Aton company. On August 17, 2006, it was announced that Air Berlin had acquired 100% of the shares in dba. The two airlines would operate under their current identities, with dba continuing to operate as an independent company under the Air Berlin umbrella, but in future would be marketed as Air Berlin (&quot;powered by dba&quot;). It had 700 employees (at March 2007). 

On 6 September 2006, the German Federal Cartel Office cleared the acquisition of 100% of the shares of dba by Air Berlin without restrictions to allow finalisation of the takeover. The winter 2006 flight schedules were harmonised and a joint schedule will be in place for the summer 2007 season.

On 30 November 2008 the parent company Air Berlin dissolved the company dba and fully integrated its planes into the Air Berlin fleet.

==Fleet==
When branded as Deutsche BA, the airline operated the following aircraft types in a livery similar to British Airways:

* Boeing 737-300
* Boeing 737-400
* Dornier 228
* Fokker 100
* Saab 2000
* Saab 340A

<doc id="1093438" wikidata="Q3740023" url="?curid=1093438" title="Fat (EP)">
<text>The Fat EP is an EP by the American punk rock band the Descendents, released in 1981 through New Alliance Records. It was the band&#x27;s first recording with singer Milo Aukerman and established their presence in the southern California hardcore punk movement, with short, aggressive songs that represented a shift in style from their previous new wave and surf sound. The EP was re-released in later years as part of several compilation albums.

==Background==
The Descendents&#x27; initial recording lineup of guitarist Frank Navetta, bassist Tony Lombardo, and drummer Bill Stevenson released the band&#x27;s 1979 debut single &quot;Ride the Wild&quot; / &quot;It&#x27;s a Hectic World&quot;, with a sound that blended Devo-like new wave and Dick Dale-style surf music. Stevenson sold copies of the single to fellow students at Mira Costa High School, attracting the attention of classmate Milo Aukerman, who began attending the band&#x27;s practices regularly. Aukerman soon became the band&#x27;s lead singer after jumping in to sing with them at practice.

The addition of Aukerman and the consumption of large amounts of coffee led the band to write shorter, faster and more aggressive songs in a hardcore punk style. Stevenson attributed the change partly to the band&#x27;s invention of the &quot;Bonus Cup&quot;: &quot;We took ⅓ of a cup of instant coffee grounds, added some hot water, threw in about 5 spoonfuls of sugar, and proceeded to play 10 second songs. The Bonus Cup became a part of everyday Descendents life&quot;. &quot;Caffeine makes you hyper&quot;, said Lombardo, &quot;In general, it makes you want to play faster.&quot; Aukerman later recalled: &quot;We started drinking too much coffee; &#x27;cause of that and the addition of me, the music became very quick and all about bursts of energy. It&#x27;s interesting: we started very melodic, then moved to hardcore, but melded the two at a certain point and became melodic hardcore&quot;.
Another factor influencing the band&#x27;s style was the concept of &quot;All&quot;, invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion during a late-night fishing trip on Stevenson&#x27;s boat, the &quot;Orca&quot;. According to Aukerman: &quot;While drinking all this coffee in the midst of catching mackerel they came up with the concept of All — doing the utmost, achieving the utmost. The more they got into it the more it turned into their own religion; it&#x27;s partly humor, but it&#x27;s also an outlook on how to conduct your life: to not settle for some, to always go for All&quot;. Stevenson described the concept of &quot;All&quot; as &quot;the total extent&quot;, and recalled that &quot;the quest for All became the main catalyst of the band, and we adopted this omni-ambitious way of life, for better and for better&quot;. He and McCuistion quickly wrote several very short songs that would later be recorded by the Descendents:
Pat insisted that we quit writing &quot;stupid girl songs&quot;, and start writing about things that really matter — like food and fishing. So he and I wrote &quot;Weinerschnitzel&quot;, &quot;All&quot;, and &quot;No, All!&quot; in a fit of Allular frustration. The songs were only seconds long, but that was all the time we needed to make the point. We temporarily put aside all of our so-called &quot;girl songs&quot; and recorded the &quot;Fat EP&quot;. This is the only record we ever made without a single love song on it.
Of these songs, &quot;Weinerschnitzel&quot; was used on the &quot;Fat EP&quot; while &quot;All&quot; and &quot;No, All!&quot; were later recorded for the 1987 album &quot;All&quot;. &quot;I just decided to not write normal songs&quot;, recalled Stevenson. I Like Food&#x27; and &#x27;Weinerschnitzel&#x27;, I thought that was the way of the future, like &#x27;yeah, these songs are more cool than normal songs.

==Recording, themes, and releases==

The &quot;Fat EP&quot; was recorded in March 1981 at Music Lab studios in Hollywood with producer Spot, and was released later that year by New Alliance Records. &quot;Weinerschnitzel&quot;, titled after the fast-food chain, is the shortest song on the EP at 10 seconds, with Lombardo playing the role of the restaurant&#x27;s counterman while Aukerman shouts his food order at him. The 16-second &quot;I Like Food&quot; also takes food as its topic, with Aukerman shouting out the names of various foodstuffs. Several other songs about food were written, but did not make it onto the EP. &quot;We were never organized enough to have concepts&quot;, recalled Stevenson in 2013. &quot;The fact of the matter is that I was 250 pounds and obsessed with chili burgers and stuff. And Frank was a little overweight at the time, too. So we were embracing our gluttony&quot;. &quot;Mr. Bass&quot; tells the story of a bass being caught during a fishing trip on board the &quot;Orca&quot; and being mounted on the fisherman&#x27;s wall. Navetta drew the illustrations for the front and back cover of the EP.

Following its initial release on New Alliance, the EP was reissued in several versions and as part of compilation albums over the next 10 years. In 1985, New Alliance re-released it as part of the &quot;Bonus Fat&quot; compilation, pairing it with the tracks from &quot;Ride the Wild&quot; / &quot;It&#x27;s a Hectic World&quot; and &quot;Global Probing&quot; from a New Alliance/SST Records compilation titled &quot;Chunks&quot;. In 1987, New Alliance was sold to SST, who re-released &quot;Bonus Fat&quot; on EP, cassette and compact disc. In 1988, it was paired with the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; as &quot;Two Things at Once&quot;. &quot;My Dad Sucks&quot;, &quot;I Like Food&quot;, and &quot;Weinerschnitzel&quot; were also included on the 1991 career retrospective &quot;Somery&quot;.

==Reception==
Music journalist and culture critic Greil Marcus used the &quot;Fat EP&quot; as the introduction to his &quot;Food Fight: Real Life Rock Top Ten 1981&quot;, remarking that &quot;if a more perfect disc has appeared this year, I haven&#x27;t heard it&quot;. Rock critic Robert Christgau called it a &quot;punk classic&quot;, praising the short, fast songs and calling &quot;Weinerschnitzel&quot; &quot;their masterpiece, eleven seconds of dialogue augmented by two guitar blams. All of the fifty or so listeners I&#x27;ve subjected to it have had the same basic response: &#x27;Play it again, willya? Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the EP 3 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;quick, immediate, goofy, fun&quot; and &quot;a hyperspeed trashing of modern youth Kultur circa 1981&quot;.

==Cover versions==
In the decades since its release, several artists have recorded cover versions of songs from the &quot;Fat EP&quot;. For the Descendents tribute album &quot;Homage: Lots of Bands Doing Descendents&#x27; Songs&quot; (1995), Squatweiler with Asteroid Wilhanna covered &quot;I Like Food&quot; while Drew covered &quot;Hey Hey&quot;. Manic Hispanic recorded a parody version of &quot;Weinerschnitzel&quot;, titled &quot;Alberto&#x27;s&quot;, for their album &quot;The Recline of Mexican Civilization&quot; (2001). Taking Back Sunday covered &quot;I Like Food&quot; on the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot; soundtrack (2005). Less Than Jake referenced &quot;Weinerschnitzel&quot; on their song &quot;Channel 4&quot; from &quot;TV/EP&quot; (2010).

<text>Man Mohan Adhikari (Magi) (; 9 June 1920 – 26 April 1999) was the 31st Prime Minister of Nepal from 1994 to 1995, representing the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). He was the first communist Prime Minister in Nepal and one of the first communist politicians in the world to be democratically elected as a head of government.

==Family and early life==
Born in Lazimpat, Kathmandu, Nepal, he spent his childhood in Biratnagar. He hailed from a landowner, Brahmin family from Eastern Nepal. He was sent to Varanasi to study in 1938. While studying for his B.Sc. in 1942, Adhikari took part in the Quit India movement and was arrested by the British colonial authorities and jailed along with other politicians.

==Life==
During his stay in India, Adhikari became involved in the communist movement, joining the Communist Party of India. He returned to Biratnagar and worked in the chemical industry where, in March 1947, he took part in the Biratnagar jute mill strike and was arrested and taken to Kathmandu via land route along with Girija Prasad Koirala and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala.

He took part in the founding of the Communist Party of Nepal in 1949. In 1957/58 Man Mohan Adhikari participated in the first democratically held Parliamentary Elections in Nepal only halfheartedly, since he was keen on broadening his organization, while he had already become a key figure in the Communist Movement in the country. In 1959, the then elected government, led by Prime Minister B.P. Koirala was sacked and the elected Parliament was dissolved by King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva citing several reasons. Man Mohan, who was then in his home town of Biratnagar, Morang was arrested and lodged in jail by Koshi Zonal Commissioner Damodar Shumshere JB Rana. While he was in custody, the then democratically elected leader of Dharan Municipality Yagya Prasad Acharya, Secretary of the then Nepal Communist Party Sunsari District Committee was entrusted by Man Mohan Adhikari to negotiate with the government authority for the release of communist leaders and cadres from detention in Sunsari and Morang districts. Acharya had several rounds of parleys with communist leaders Mohan Adhikari, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, Radha Prasad Ghimire and others inside the jail and Zonal Commissioner Rana and Chief Administrator of Morang District Jeevan Lal Satyal. Adhikari, was a democratic persona, so he was of the opinion that all leaders and cadres who were democratically elected in public positions such as municipal councils, should continue their jobs for maintaining continued contacts with their constituencies, instead of playing an opposition role and going to jail. This policy of Man Mohan was a key move for the re-invigoration and expansion of the communist party in Eastern Nepal.

As per the instruction of leader Adhikari, a public statement pledging support to the Constructive Leadership of the King was issued and several leaders of the then Nepal Communist Party under custody in Sunsari and Morang districts were freed. After release from the jail Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Radha Parsad Ghimire (who was released after few months), Shailendra was given an audience by the King in Kathmandu, and entrusted an assignment to galvanize support for the political action taken by the King recently, who later was made the Assistant Home Affairs Minister of the country by King Mahendra.
During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Adhikari asserted that the war was an Indian aggression against Pakistan.

In November 1994, elections were held following a dissolution of parliament. Despite Congress securing a higher popular vote than the UML, the latter secured 88 seats to the former&#x27;s 83. Neither party was successful in forming a coalition to hold a majority of the 205 seats. After failed coalition negotiations, however, Adhikari became Prime Minister of a minority government, acquiring the support of the National Democratic Party and the Sadbhavana Party.

In June 1995, the National Democratic Party and the Sadbhavana Party (who helped the UML form a minority government in November 1994) supported the Nepali Congress&#x27;s call for a vote of no-confidence in Adhikari&#x27;s government in a special session of the House of Representatives. Adhikari attempted to dissolve parliament and call elections in an attempt to replicate the circumstances under which he assumed office in 1994. But a Supreme Court challenge led by Congress saw this move deemed unconstitutional and the parliament was restored. The vote of no-confidence proceeded successfully. Elections in 1995 saw Adhikari&#x27;s government voted out of office.

Adhikari was one of the few democratically elected communist party members in the world to serve as head of the government.

==Health and death==

Adhikari suffered from asthma for four decades and went to China for four years to seek treatment after contracting tuberculosis.

On 19 April 1999, he suffered a heart attack during an election rally in the village of Gothatar and fell into a coma. He was declared brain dead on 22 April with no hope of recovery. He died four days later. He was survived by his wife and two children.

<text>I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up is the second studio album by the American punk rock band the Descendents, released on May 15, 1985 through New Alliance Records. It marked the end of a two-year hiatus for the band, during which singer Milo Aukerman had attended college and drummer Bill Stevenson had joined Black Flag. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; was the first of two albums the Descendents recorded with guitarist Ray Cooper, and their last with original bassist Tony Lombardo, who quit the group because he did not want to go on tour. Though recorded quickly and without much rehearsal time, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who praised its catchy songs, strong melodies, and pop-influenced love songs.

== Background ==
The Descendents&#x27; first full-length album, &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; (1982), had been so named because singer Milo Aukerman was departing the band to attend college; he enrolled at El Camino College for one year, then attended the University of California, San Diego from 1983 to 1985, where he studied biology. In his absence, the band—guitarist Frank Navetta, drummer Bill Stevenson, and bassist Tony Lombardo—recruited Ray Cooper as singer and continued performing locally for a time during 1982 and 1983. Cooper preferred playing guitar to singing, however, and the band would occasionally perform with Aukerman as a quintet during his return visits to Los Angeles.

Stevenson also joined Black Flag in early 1983, intending to be in both bands simultaneously. &quot;I&#x27;m the Descendents&#x27; drummer&quot;, he said at the time. &quot;I&#x27;m permanently in both bands. Other than that, I&#x27;m a nice person.&quot; He spent most of January–May 1983 on the road with Black Flag, touring the United States and Europe. With this experience, he desired to take the Descendents on tour as well: &quot;I got a taste of touring in Black Flag,&quot; he later recalled, &quot;and I wanted to take that and spread it laterally to what the Descendents would or could do.&quot; However, he encountered resistance from Navetta and Lombardo: &quot;Bill kind of sat down with me and Frank and said something to the effect of we were at a point where we needed to grow by going on the road&quot;, Lombardo later said. &quot;Frank said no, and I had to say no also, so he said he had to leave the band and we were both kind of bummed out. I don&#x27;t think Frank even believed him at first. That was a bad scenario.&quot; Stevenson soon found Black Flag&#x27;s touring and recording schedule too busy to allow time for the Descendents. &quot;I got in over my head&quot;, Stevenson later said. &quot;When I joined [Black] Flag I had every intention of doing both bands but it was physically impossible. Flag had all this stuff in progress, so I put Descendents on hold.&quot;

With the Descendents effectively on hiatus, Navetta, Lombardo, and Cooper tried to start a new band, the Ascendants, but only played one show. Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman. Stevenson remained in Black Flag, with whom he recorded five studio albums, a live album, and two EPs, and toured consistently from March through December 1984. According to Aukerman, the idea to record a new Descendents album originated in March 1985 during the recording of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Loose Nut&quot; album:

Bill was recording with Black Flag and he invited me up to do backing vocals for &quot;Loose Nut&quot;. He pulled me aside and he&#x27;s like &quot;Hey, I got these songs, but they&#x27;re not Black Flag songs, they&#x27;re really more Descendents songs&quot;, and I said &quot;Let me hear them.&quot; It was just an instrumental track and he sang over it and sang &quot;Silly Girl&quot; to me and I was like &quot;Wow!&quot; He said &quot;I can&#x27;t do these in Black Flag.&quot; I said &quot;Well, maybe we should do them!&quot;

By April 1985 Stevenson had left Black Flag and he, Aukerman, Lombardo, and Cooper reconvened as the Descendents to record the band&#x27;s second album.

==Writing==
In addition to the songs Stevenson had written, the other band members made songwriting contributions to the album. Although Frank Navetta had left the band, one song he had written lyrics for, &quot;Rockstar&quot;, was used for the album. Cooper&#x27;s sole writing credit is on lyrics to the lead track, &quot;Descendents&quot;, which are attributed to the entire band. Descendents&#x27; was written by Ray and I about Bill leaving the band&quot;, said Lombardo. The song opens with the lyrics &quot;Just because we&#x27;ve gone away / Here&#x27;s a message from me and Ray / We&#x27;re not gonna let the music die / Join us if you&#x27;ve got the energy&quot;.

Lombardo contributed the album&#x27;s title track, which expressed his desire for individuality: &quot;I would write a song like &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&#x27; like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to grow up because I don&#x27;t want to be like certain adults that were negatively influencing the world, he recalled in 2013, &quot;not just &#x27;I want to be a kid and live like a kid.&#x27; I don&#x27;t want to grow up to be like &quot;you&quot;.&quot;

Aukerman&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;Pervert&quot; dealt with his conflicting feelings about his libido: &quot;[&#x27;Pervert&#x27;] is about how I like to have sex, but sometimes I like it so much that I think I&#x27;m perverted&quot;, he said in a mid-1980s interview. &quot;Sometimes I want to have sex so much that I think I&#x27;m a pervert, so that&#x27;s why I wrote the song. Even though sex is the healthiest thing in the world, the most natural thing, sometimes for some strange reason my psyche tells me that I should be a pervert for wanting to have it so much.&quot;

==Recording==

The band learned the new material and recorded the album within a two-week period, leaving little time to rehearse the songs. In addition to the time constraint, they had lost the rehearsal space they had shared with Black Flag, and until the first day of recording were unable to practice with all of their equipment plugged in. As a result, the songs had much more of a pop sound on the album than they did when the band performed them live. &quot;We could&#x27;ve put a lot more practice time into it,&quot; said Aukerman during the album&#x27;s supporting tours, &quot;but I think that the songs themselves are just really good songs. We play them all better now.&quot;

&quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; was recorded in April 1985 at Music Lab studios in Hollywood with producer and engineer David Tarling, who had worked with Stevenson on the recording and production of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Loose Nut&quot; (1985), &quot;The Process of Weeding Out&quot; (1985), and &quot;In My Head&quot; (1985). &quot;He was really fond of those 1980s production trappings, and the record is polluted and corrupted with them&quot;, Stevenson later reflected, complaining that &quot;[It] sounds like all weird, reverby, crazy &#x27;80s shit.&quot; He also recalled that at one point Tarling passed out, leading Stevenson to take over the recording controls: &quot;[He] was having some kind of problems or something, and he was drinking a lot, and he got so drunk while we were recording that he passed out. So I basically kinda rolled his chair out of the way and rolled my chair in place of it, and then lo and behold, Bill Stevenson is an engineer! And of course that record sounds terrible! I fucked it up good and well, but that&#x27;s how I started learning. So it was basically a DIY kinda thing.&quot;

== Release and touring ==
Like &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; was released as an LP record through New Alliance Records, an independent record label run by D. Boon and Mike Watt of the San Pedro-based punk band the Minutemen, who were contemporaries of the Descendents. Stevenson prepared a tour to support the album, but Lombardo declined due to his personal and professional commitments, thus quitting the band. Stevenson later regretting not being more accommodating:

&quot;Grow Up&quot; was coming out and it&#x27;s like &quot;Hey, this is gonna come out and we need to go play shows. We can&#x27;t just stay here.&quot; I probably wasn&#x27;t thinking about the wholeness of the lineup and the friendships there as much as just thinking about &quot;well, I want the band to do more.&quot; I may have inadvertently trampled a few innocent victims in the path [...] Looking back on it, I should have been more sensitive to Tony&#x27;s time limitations and maybe tried to limit the touring to if he had a week or two off. That would have been the compassionate thing to do as a band of friends, but I think I was too hell-bent on charging it and going for it. The band was just too good to be &quot;Let&#x27;s practice four days a week and do two shows a month.&quot; We were just too good of a band for that to be the end of our story.

Lombardo was replaced in the band&#x27;s lineup by Doug Carrion, who had attended Mira Costa High School with Aukerman and Stevenson and was playing in a band called Anti. &quot;I get this weird note on my door,&quot; recalled Carrion, &quot;and it&#x27;s like &#x27;Hey, this is Bill. I&#x27;m thinking about doing the Descendents again. Tony can&#x27;t do it, so I want to know if you want to give it a swing.&#x27; So we practiced getting me brought up to speed and then, right as school was ready to stop, Milo jumped in the van and we started doing shows.&quot; The Descendents undertook three tours of the United States between April 1985 and March 1986 to support &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot;. The band&#x27;s first performance outside of California was June 21, 1985, at CBGB in New York City. Their first tour then began in Phoenix, Arizona on July 18 and took the band east through the Southern United States, north to the Mid-Atlantic states and New England, west through the Midwestern United States, then through Colorado, Utah, and Idaho to Seattle before heading south along the West Coast of the United States, ending September 14 in San Diego; covering 27 states with a total of 43 shows in 42 cities. Carrion later recalled of the experience:

That first tour was probably one of the most difficult tours and the funnest tour at the same time. The hard part was we were traveling in this horrible, horrible, beat-up &#x27;71 Ford Econoline van in the dead of summer with no air conditioning. You&#x27;re laying on this plywood loft and the sun&#x27;s sweltering on the ceiling. You stay at sketchy houses in sketchy neighborhoods with sketchy people. There&#x27;s a show on Friday and Saturday, and then you&#x27;re just wandering the states wondering what to do. &quot;Holy smokes, there&#x27;s a show in Seattle and we&#x27;re in El Paso. How many days do we have to get there? Nine. What are we gonna do for nine days?&quot; Funny, crazy, and everybody was kind of dedicated to having about as much fun as could happen in a 24-hour period.

The second tour was more sporadic and localized, with 15 shows in California, Arizona, and Nevada between September 19 and December 15. The Descendents played the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., on December 20 before starting their third tour in Phoenix, Arizona the following day. This tour followed a similar route to the first, going through the Southwestern and Southern states before turning north to Pennsylvania; then crossing into Canada for three shows in Ontario, the band&#x27;s first outside the United States; then through the Midwestern states; ending March 1 in Salt Lake City; covering 20 states and Ontario with a total of 39 shows in 39 cities.

In 1987 New Alliance was sold to SST Records, who re-released &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; on LP, cassette, and compact disc.

== Reception ==
Ned Raggett of Allmusic gave &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot; four stars out of five, saying that &quot;When the four want to be straight up and perfectly poppy, they can and do with smashing success, with surprisingly mature, emotional lyrics and playing that doesn&#x27;t rely on all-speed all the time.&quot; Rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ rating, saying &quot;They &#x27;don&#x27;t even know how to sing&#x27;, they excoriate themselves as perverts for wanting sex, and when they fall in love they try to write Beatles songs. Chances are you&#x27;ll find them awkward, but I&#x27;m tremendously encouraged that they can fall in love at all. Anyway, their Beatles songs are pretty catchy.&quot; In a 2004 biography of the band, Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that the album &quot;featured the most singable tunes the band had ever written. &#x27;Good Good Things&#x27;, &#x27;In Love This Way&#x27;, and &#x27;Can&#x27;t Go Back&#x27; were positively sunny by Descendents standards; the Beach Boys-gone-punk vibe was an obvious precursor to Weezer. The real advance was their ability to give strong melodies to thrash songs: &#x27;My World&#x27; and &#x27;Silly Girl&#x27; border on heavy metal but leave out the goofy excess and include way more self-pity.&quot;

According to Finn McKenty, the band and the album was a major influence on what would be known as pop punk in the 1990s and 2000s, mainly due to the band&#x27;s &quot;fairly normal&quot; image and upbeat songs with lyrics about growing up, going to school/college, falling in love, breaking up, rather than something political, aggressive, violent or anti-social—themes that were prevalent in the punk rock and hardcore music at the time.

<doc id="1093457" wikidata="Q5791238" url="?curid=1093457" title="William Torrey Harris">
<text>William Torrey Harris (September 10, 1835 – November 5, 1909) was an American educator, philosopher, and lexicographer. He worked for nearly a quarter century in St. Louis, Missouri, where he taught school and served as Superintendent of Schools for twelve years. With Susan Blow, in 1873 he established the first permanent, public kindergarten in the country. He is also known for establishing high school as an integral part of public education.

Increasingly interested in Hegelian philosophy, he was cofounder of &quot;Journal of Speculative Philosophy&quot; (1867), the first philosophical journal in the US. He also worked with Amos Bronson Alcott&#x27;s Concord School of Philosophy. In 1889 Harris was appointed as US Commissioner of Education, and served in that role, under four presidents, until 1906.

==Early life==
Born in 1835 in North Killingly, Connecticut, he attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He completed two years at Yale College, then moved West.

==Career==
Beginning at age 22, Harris taught school and made his career in St. Louis, Missouri, from 1857 to 1880, a period when the city was growing rapidly. It served both as a gateway to the West and as an industrializing city on the Mississippi River.

He served as Superintendent of Schools from 1868 to 1880, and had a strong influence on the system. With Susan E. Blow in this city, in 1873 he established America&#x27;s first permanent public kindergarten. While in St. Louis, William Torrey Harris implemented many influential ideas to strengthen both the institution of the public school system and the basic philosophical principles of education.
His changes resulted in the expansion of the public school curriculum to include high school. He believed it was essential to growth of an individual and to meet new challenges of the industrial age. The expanded programs included art, music, and scientific and manual studies. He also encouraged all public schools to acquire libraries.

Harris&#x27;s St. Louis schools were considered some of the best in the country. His fellow educators included many local farmers and tradesemen who were immigrants from German provinces after the failed revolutions of 1848. They had a strong belief in education.

In St. Louis, Harris met mechanic and philosopher Henry Clay Brockmeyer, a German immigrant whose influence turned him toward hegelianism. With Brockmeyer and other of the St. Louis Hegelians, Harris founded and edited the &quot;Journal of Speculative Philosophy&quot; (1867); it was the first philosophical periodical in the United States. He edited it until 1893. Its contributors promoted Hegel&#x27;s concept of time and events as part of a universal plan, a working out of an eternal historical dialectic.

Harris returned to New England, where he was associated with Amos Bronson Alcott&#x27;s Concord School of Philosophy in Massachusetts from 1880 to 1889.

In 1889 Harris was appointed as U.S. Commissioner of Education, serving under presidents Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, until 1906. Harris worked to organize all phases of education on the principles of philosophical pedagogy as espoused by Hegel, Kant, Fichte, Fröbel, Pestalozzi and many others of idealist philosophies.

As US Commissioner of Education, Harris also strongly supported education and assimilation of Native Americans. He wrote the introduction to the Bureau of Education Bulletin (No. 1, 1889) on &quot;Indian Education&quot;, issued under Thomas Jefferson Morgan, Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Harris called for mandatory education of American Indians through a partnership with Christianity in order to promote industry. Harris called for the removal of Native children from their families for up to 10 years of training for the &quot;lower form of civilization&quot;, as a way of assimilating Indians into &quot;American&quot; civilization. He believed this was necessary to save the race, who he believed had to shift from their traditional cultures.

Harris wrote, 
&quot;We owe it to ourselves and to the enlightened public opinion of the world to save the Indian, and not destroy him. We can not save him and his patriarchal or tribal institution both together. To save him we must take him up into our form of civilization. We must approach him in the missionary spirit and we must supplement missionary action by the aid of the civil arm of the State. We must establish compulsory education for the good of the lower race.&quot;

Harris died on November 5, 1909, in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Honors==
Harris was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. from various American and foreign universities, as he had an international reputation.

In 1906 the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching conferred upon him &quot;as the first man to whom such recognition for meritorious service is given, the highest retiring allowance which our rules will allow, an annual income of $3000.&quot;

==Public issues==
According to biographer Carl Byerly, Harris argued that the purpose of education In a democracy was:
* To achieve equality of opportunity
* Self-preservation of the state
* To teach morality and self-discipline
* To awaken powers of self-activity
* To develop directive power
* To maintain mobility of population
* To preserve and create property
* To give technical training
* To remain responsive to social change

Harris was a strong proponent of the American colonial projects in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines following the Spanish–American War. In an article entitled &quot;An Educational Policy for Our New Possessions&quot;, Harris wrote:
If the other people of the world to the number of some fourteen hundred millions are united under the five great powers of Europe, while we in turn have only one hundred millions, our national idea will be threatened abroad and have more dangers than ever at home...We must accept the charge of as many of these colonies as come to our hand. We must seek to give them civilization in the highest sense that we can conceive of it...The highest ideal of a civilization is that of a civilization that is engaged constantly in elevating lower classes of people into participation of all that is good and reasonable and perpetually increasing at the same time their self-activity. Such a civilization we have a right to enforce on this earth.

==Achievements==

He was also assistant editor of &quot;Johnson’s New Universal Cyclopaedia&quot; and editor of &quot;Appletons&#x27; International Education Series&quot;. He expanded the United States Bureau of Education and started graphic exhibits of the United States in international expositions.

He was responsible for introducing reindeer into Alaska so that the native whalers and trappers would have another livelihood, before they brought other species to extinction.

Harris was one of the 30 founding members of the Simplified Spelling Board, founded in 1906 by Andrew Carnegie to make English easier to learn and understand through changes in the orthography of the English language.

As editor-in-chief of &quot;Webster&#x27;s New International Dictionary&quot; (1909), he originated the divided page.

In the book &quot;The Educational Philosophy of William T. Harris&quot; by Richard D. Mosier, it is stated that Harris forms the bridge between the mechanism, associationism, and utilitarianism of the 18th century and the pragmatism, experimentalism, and instrumentalism of the 20th century.

William Torrey Harris took Bacon’s original ideas on the organization of information for libraries and modernized them to be applied in the United States by the second half of the 1800s. William Harris, who worked creating a library catalog for the Public Library School of St. Louis, wrote an essay on creating an organization system for libraries. It wasn’t the first one in America, but it was a scheme that gained international reputation rapidly. Harris used a deductive hierarchy and created a structure better adapted to the interrelation of knowledge, which facilitated its application in libraries’ catalogs. Harris proposed a practical system of rules for the classification going from the generic to the specific. Those rules included main divisions, ultimate divisions, appendixes, and hybrids. The problem with Bacon’s approach was the difficulty to limit all knowledge within a restricted classification. Conversely, Harris suggested that content is predominant in minor divisions and sections, while form is the “guiding principle” in the main divisions.

==Works==

Besides voluminous reports on educational matters, many papers contributed to the &quot;Proceedings of the American Social Science Association&quot;, and various compilations edited by him, his publications include: 
* &quot;Introduction to the Study of Philosophy&quot; (1889)
* &quot;The Spiritual Sense of Dante&#x27;s Divina Commedia&quot; (1889)
* &quot;Hegel&#x27;s Logic: a Critical Exposition&quot; (1890)
* &quot;A. Bronson Alcott, his Life and Philosophy&quot; (with F. B. Sanborn) (1893)
* &quot;Psychologic Foundations of Education&quot; (1898)
* &quot;Elementary Education&quot; (Monographs on Education in the United States; vol. 1.) (1900; second edition, 1904)
* &quot;The School City&quot; (1906)

==Legacy==
Harris–Stowe State University in St. Louis is named for Harris, and author Harriet Beecher Stowe.

Public School 11 in New York City was named the William T. Harris School but was renamed the Sarah J. Garnet School in 2022.

<doc id="1093458" wikidata="Q2079881" url="?curid=1093458" title="Yusuf Salman Yusuf">
<text>Yusuf Salman Yusuf (; 19 July 1901 – 14 February 1949), better known by his nom de guerre Comrade Fahd (), was one of the first Iraqi communist activists. He was the first secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party, from 1941 until his execution in 1949. He is generally credited with a vital role in the party&#x27;s rapid organizational growth in the 1940s. For the last two years of his life, he directed the party from prison.

==Early life==
Yusuf Salman Yusuf was born in Baghdad in 1901 to a father from Bartella, in the province of Mosul, northern Iraq. His family was of humble origins, and his father is recorded as having made his living selling cakes and sweets. In 1907 he moved with his family to Basra in the south of the country in search of a better livelihood.

Yusuf was an ethnic Assyrian of Chaldean Catholic faith and attended the Syriac Christian School in Basra from 1908 to 1914, and the American Mission School in the city from 1914 to 1916. His education was then interrupted as his father had fallen ill and he had to seek employment for the family&#x27;s upkeep. He first took a job as a translator and clerk with the British Army in Basra, before moving to Nasiriyah in 1919 to help his brother run a mill. In 1924 he returned to Basra and gained employment as a clerk at the Electricity Supply Authority. He also goes by Fahad Squad.

==Early communist activity and travel abroad==
In 1927, Yusuf met Piotr Vasili, a fellow Assyrian and an undercover emissary of the Comintern, who introduced him to socialism and communism. He took part in the first communist circle established that year in al-Nasiriyya.

Two years later, in 1929, Yusuf left his job at the Electricity Supply Authority and applied for a passport to travel abroad. His application was refused due to his lack of funds, but he left the country anyway, traveling through Khuzestan, Kuwait, Syria and Palestine. In the course of this voyage he appears to have attempted to contact the Comintern and to have asked the Palestine Communist Party for funds to help him engage in political work in Iraq.

In 1930, the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty was signed, leading to widespread anger in Iraq. Yusuf returned home and a year later was active in organizing the July 1931 strikes in response to the introduction of a new municipal tax. He continued his agitational and propaganda activities in al-Nasiriyya until February 1935, when he left Iraq once more, this time headed for Moscow where he was due to enroll at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East (KUTV) for training as a future leader of communist party activity. He traveled through Syria, France and Italy before arriving in the Soviet Union, where he remained a student until summer 1937. It appears that before his return to Iraq at the end of January 1938, he may have been entrusted with a Comintern mission in Western Europe; he seems to have spent the winter of 1938 in France and Belgium.

==Return to Iraq==
On his return, Yusuf – for the moment going by the party name of &quot;Sa&#x27;id&quot; - met Abdullah Mas&#x27;ud, who was organising a communist group in Baghdad. He then travelled around the country for some time, but in December 1940, on hearing that Mas&#x27;ud was launching a communist journal, &quot;al-Shararah&quot; (&quot;the spark&quot;), he returned to Baghdad and requested that he be in charge of it. This Mas&#x27;ud refused, but he suggested that Fahd stay in Baghdad and engage in party work on a stipend, and Fahd accepted the offer.

==Leader of a split party==
On 29 October 1941, the police arrested Abdullah Mas&#x27;ud and Fahd took over his leadership role. In November he was elected first secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party, and immediately set about imposing his authority on the organization, dismissing most members of the old Central Committee. Fahd&#x27;s leadership style led to a dispute with a prominent member of the leadership, Zhu Nun Ayyub, who repeatedly demanded that Fahd convene a party congress which would adopt rules for the party. Fahd responded by having Ayyub and his supporters expelled in August 1942.

In November 1942 Fahd demanded the sacking from the Central Committee of another member, Wadi&#x27; Talyah. His opponents on the committee refused to accept this, and accused him of egocentrism and dictatorship. The row had not been resolved when Fahd had to travel abroad. During his absence, Abdullah Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s supporters called a party congress without informing other members of the Central Committee. The congress, held on 20 November, dismissed all Fahd&#x27;s supporters – but not Fahd himself – from the committee and elected Mas&#x27;ud first secretary.

As the new Central Committee had retained control of &quot;Al-Sharara&quot;, Fahd&#x27;s supporters started issuing a new journal, entitled &quot;al-Qa&#x27;ida&quot; (&quot;the base&quot;), in February 1943. Fahd returned to Baghdad in April 1943, and the difficult process of reuniting the party began. However, he was soon able to concentrate on organisational work.

==Building the base for a mass party, 1943 - 1947==
In building up the party, Fahd was guided by his own class feelings and political distrust of the intelligentsia and students, as much as by Leninist principles. He concentrated on the workers in the foreign-owned industries, and was assisted primarily by his trusted supporters Ali Sakar, Zaki Bassim and Ahmad &#x27;Abbas. While a large proportion of the industrial workforce was employed in small locally owned workshops, the party paid less attention to this sector; in many cases they were working for members of their extended family, and in addition they did not have the strategic importance of the Kirkuk oilfield workers, the railwaymen, or the workers at Basra port, all of whom were in large measure won over to the party during Fahd&#x27;s leadership.

In December 1943 to January 1944, the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party held a congress and adopted party rules and a programme couched in moderate terms. Perhaps inspired by this example – although his relationship with Khalid Bakdash, first secretary of the Syrian party and doyen of the communist movement in the Arab east, was never an easy one - Fahd relented on the question of holding a congress for the Iraqi party. A party conference met in March 1944 in Ali Shakar&#x27;s house in the al-Shaikh &#x27;Umar quarter of Baghdad and agreed a National Charter. It also adopted the Syrian party&#x27;s slogan, &quot;A free homeland and a happy people&quot; (&quot;watanun hurrun wa sha&#x27;bun sa&#x27;id&quot;). The first party congress met a year later.

==Arrest and imprisonment, 1947 - 1949==
On 18 January 1947 the police found Fahd and Zaki Bassim at the house of a party member, Ibrahim Bajir Shmayyel. All three were arrested and interrogated in the Central Baghdad Investigation Department, before being transferred to Abu Ghraib prison near the capital. Meanwhile, Yehuda Siddiq took over as &quot;first &quot;mas&#x27;ul&quot;&quot; or comrade in charge. Fahd instructed him to hand over control to Malik Saif, but he initially refused to obey.

In Abu Ghraib the three were held in appalling conditions, deprived of daylight for long periods. On 13 June they started a hunger strike in protest. The authorities finally brought the three communists for trial at the High Criminal Court on 20 June. They were charged with &quot;reliance on foreign sources of income&quot;, &quot;contact with a foreign state&quot; and with &quot;the party of Khalid Bakdash&quot;, designs subversive of the constitutional order and incitement to insurrection, and the propagation of communism along members of the armed forces. On the 23 June all three were found guilty and condemned to death.

The sentences created uproar, and the government backed down, commuting them to life imprisonment for Fahd and fifteen years for Bassim and Shmayyel. The three were transferred from the death row at Abu Ghraib to Baghdad Central Prison and then to Kut Prison.

From Kut, Fahd was able to communicate regularly with the party. After the revolutionary episode of &quot;al-Wathbah&quot; (&quot;the leap&quot; of January 1948 in Baghdad), he demanded constant activity. In line with his orders, the country was shaken by strikes and demonstrations between January and May. However, the agitation that took hold of Iraq on account of the Arab-Zionist conflict in Palestine distracted attention from issues that favoured the communists, and the party then lost considerable credibility when it accepted the Soviet Union&#x27;s position in favour of the partition of Palestine.

A graver setback yet came when, on 9 October 1948, a party member told police the location of the party&#x27;s secret headquarters. The police raided the house and arrested Yehuda Siddiq, who after 28 days under torture broke down and told his interrogators that Malik Saif was the first &quot;mas&#x27;ul&quot;. Saif, when interrogated, admitted everything. The government thus found out that Fahd was secretly directing the party from Kut prison, and it decided to dispose of him.

==Death of Fahd==
On 10 February 1949, Fahd was court-martialled on a charge of organising communist activity from prison, along with Zaki Bassim and Muhammad Husain al-Sabibi. All three were sentenced to death. They were hanged on 13 and 14 February in public squares in Baghdad. Fahd was hanged in al-Karkh, in a square that was later named the Square of the New Museum. The bodies were left hanging for several hours as a warning to the populace. Fahd was then buried by the police in an unmarked grave in al-Mu&#x27;azzam cemetery.

The death of Fahd appeared at the time to be a grave blow to the Iraqi communist movement. However, a few years later, the party was stronger than ever; a genuine mass movement, it seemed one of the most powerful political organisations of any Arab country. Fahd&#x27;s organisational work, and the aura of martyrdom associated with his death at the hands of a deeply unpopular government, were essential factors in creating that movement.

<text>Julius W. Harris (August 17, 1923 – October 17, 2004) was an American actor who appeared in more than 70 movies and numerous television series in a career that spanned four decades. Harris is best known for his roles in 1970s films such as &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and the blaxploitation films &quot;Super Fly&quot;, &quot;Black Caesar&quot; and &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a father who was a musician and a mother who had been employed by the Cotton Club in New York City as a dancer, Harris worked as a nurse, and a bouncer in New York City jazz clubs. Before he began his acting career, Harris served as a medic in the U.S. Army during World War II. After hanging out with many struggling actors, he took a dare and auditioned for his first role and was cast as the father in &quot;Nothing But a Man&quot;, a critically acclaimed 1964 film about black life in the South starring Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln.

Some of his most prominent roles included the villainous, steel-armed Tee Hee in the James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, Scatter in &quot;Super Fly&quot;, Bubbletop Woodson in &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;, Captain Bollin in &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, Inspector Daniels in &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot;, Joseph in &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; and Ugandan President Idi Amin in the TV movie &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot;.

He also appeared in &quot;Trouble Man&quot;, &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Black Caesar&quot;, &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;, &quot;Friday Foster&quot;, &quot;Shrunken Heads&quot;, &quot;Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man&quot; and in guest-starring roles on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot;, and &quot;Love Boat&quot; among others. Harris was a member of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York City and appeared on Broadway in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play, &quot;No Place to Be Somebody&quot;.

===Death===
Harris died from heart failure on October 17, 2004, while admitted at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital. He was 81. He was cremated and interred in Philadelphia, his place of birth, and was survived by his daughter Kimberly and son Gideon.

<text>The Communist Party of Abkhazia (CPA; ; ) is a political party in Abkhazia. Its current leader is Lev Shamba. 

== History ==
The CPA was founded in March 1921 with the demand of a separate Abkhaz Soviet Republic. It was then led by Efrem Eshba. Eshba had formed a Bolshevik military-revolutionary committee in Sukhumi in the summer of 1918. Eshba&#x27;s group demanded direct integration of Abkhazia into the Soviet Union. During the Soviet period, the CPA was a part of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1988, the CPA demanded Abkhaz secession.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, the CPA was refounded as an independent party on 4 March 1995. In the nineties, it was led by Enver Kapba. During the first Presidential election of Abkhazia, in 1999, it supported President Ardzinba (who ran unopposed). During the Ardzinba era, it functioned as a loyal opposition party.

The CPA maintains close contacts with communist groups in Russia. It is affiliated to the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union. However, unlike many of the other communist organisations in the region, the CPA has denounced the political legacy of Joseph Stalin.

The CPA planned to hold its 8th congress on 30 October 2013, and Lev Shamba announced that he planned to resign as leader, which he had been for eight years, but he was still Chairman by the time of the Party&#x27;s twentieth anniversary in 2015.

On 29 February 2016, the Communist Party became a founding member of the Council for the National Unity of the Republic of Abkhazia, uniting political forces that were neither pro-government nor pro-opposition.

<doc id="1093467" wikidata="Q3752798" url="?curid=1093467" title="Enjoy! (Descendents album)">
<text>Enjoy! is the third studio album by American punk rock band Descendents, released in 1986 through New Alliance Records and Restless Records. It was the band&#x27;s final album with guitarist Ray Cooper and only album with bassist Doug Carrion, both of whom left the group after the album&#x27;s first supporting tour. &quot;Enjoy!&quot; was marked by the use of toilet humor, with references to defecation and flatulence in its artwork, the title track, and &quot;Orgofart&quot;. It also displayed a darker, more heavy metal-influenced sound in the songs &quot;Hürtin&#x27; Crüe&quot;, &quot;Days Are Blood&quot;, and &quot;Orgo 51&quot;. Reviewers were critical of both the scatological humor and the heavier songs on the album. &quot;Enjoy!&quot; features a cover version of The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Wendy&quot;.

== Writing ==

Following three tours of the United States in support of 1985&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up&quot;, the Descendents prepared to record their third album, their first with bassist Doug Carrion. As with their prior records, all four band members contributed songwriting ideas to the album. Some of their new songs displayed a heavy metal influence, including &quot;Hürtin&#x27; Crüe&quot;, the instrumental &quot;Orgo 51&quot;, and the nearly 8-minute &quot;Days Are Blood&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;d been on tour for so long that we wrote some messed-up freakazoid songs like &#x27;Days Are Blood&#x27; and all these weird things&quot;, recalled singer Milo Aukerman in 2013. The lyrics of &quot;Hürtin&#x27; Crüe&quot; derived from a high school classmate of Aukerman&#x27;s who had earned a score of 1420 on the SAT, gaining him admittance to the United States Military Academy. Gloating about his accomplishment, he sang a taunt that went &quot;I am better than you / You are a piece of poo / 1420&quot;. Aukerman incorporated these lyrics into &quot;Hürtin&#x27; Crüe&quot;.
The song &quot;Enjoy&quot;, which became the album&#x27;s title track, openly celebrates flatulence and foot odor. Drummer Bill Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Kids&quot; celebrates the band&#x27;s love of coffee-fueled hyperactivity, referencing their go-to drink, the &quot;Bonus Cup&quot;, a mud-like slurry of coffee grounds, hot water, and sugar. &quot;Thanks to modern chemistry, sleep is now optional&quot; he declares at the song&#x27;s end. Aukerman and Carrion&#x27;s &quot;Sour Grapes&quot; is sung from the perspective of a frustrated geek whose advances are rebuffed by a new wave girl.

== Recording and cover art ==
&quot;Enjoy!&quot; was recorded in March and April 1986 at Radio Tokyo studios in Venice, Los Angeles. The Descendents recorded their own farts live in the studio for inclusion on the title track and &quot;Orgofart&quot; (the latter has no instrumentation, consisting entirely of the band members cheering each other on as they fart into recording equipment). Stevenson produced the album, while studio owner Ethan James and his assistant Richard Andrews served as recording engineers. It was Andrews&#x27; first experience recording a band on his own, and he found the Descendents&#x27; crude humor startling:
I was a jazz musician, and I was at Radio Tokyo cutting my own demos. Ethan James, the owner of the studio, said &quot;If you want to learn how to engineer, I need help.&quot; Finally I&#x27;m good enough and he&#x27;s ready to give me some clients, and he says to me &quot;There&#x27;s this record that I want you to do&quot;, and I&#x27;m like &quot;Alright! A record! I got a fucking record!&quot; and I go in to do it and it&#x27;s the Descendents and they&#x27;re farting. I&#x27;m a classically trained musician; I learned to play piano at four, I went to a conservatory for two years, I studied at Berklee College of Music. I know all this stuff, and Bill&#x27;s like &quot;Stick the microphone closer to my ass so you can hear this fart!&quot; It was terrible. But as time went on, I discovered that it&#x27;s not about what you know about the music, it&#x27;s about &quot;are you expressing yourself authentically through the music?&quot;, and these guys totally brought the idea of authenticity to my fore, and that totally changed my perception of all music. And to have that &quot;bing&quot; moment from punk rockers was a real mind trip.

Andrews would continue to work with the Descendents and their successor band, All, recording five more of their releases between 1987 and 1989. Stevenson later said that the recording and production qualities on the finished album were &quot;wearing the &#x27;80s new wave influence really boldly on the sleeve.&quot;

The cover artwork for &quot;Enjoy!&quot;, which depicts a roll of toilet paper, was drawn by guitarist Ray Cooper under the pseudonym &quot;Scoob Droolins&quot;. Rather than listing the song titles on the reverse of the album&#x27;s sleeve, the band instead replaced them with various euphemisms for feces, such as &quot;floater&quot;, &quot;sausage&quot;, and &quot;loaf&quot;. Stevenson later explained this as an attempt to &quot;come up with as many toilet humor-related jokes as possible.&quot;

== Release and supporting tours ==
&quot;Enjoy!&quot; was released jointly through New Alliance Records and Restless Records as a ten-track LP. In 1987 New Alliance was sold to SST Records, who re-released &quot;Enjoy!&quot; on LP, cassette, and compact disc. The cassette and CD versions added two additional tracks, &quot;Orgofart&quot; and &quot;Orgo 51&quot;. A music video, the band&#x27;s first, was created for the song &quot;Kids&quot;.

The Descendents supported the album with a tour of the United States through the summer of 1986, beginning June 26 in Chicago and proceeding through the Southern and Mid-Atlantic states, into Canada to Montreal and Toronto, then visiting most of the Midwestern states before making their way northwest to Vancouver, and finally down the West Coast of the United States back to Los Angeles by August 30; covering 34 states and 3 Canadian provinces with a total of 58 shows in 56 cities. For most of their July dates they were supported by Dag Nasty. Cooper and Carrion both left the band that fall, in what Carrion later described as an amicable split. They were replaced by bassist Karl Alvarez and guitarist Stephen Egerton who, after practicing with the band for a few months, played on the second &quot;Enjoy!&quot; tour from late November 1986 to mid-January 1987. This second tour followed a different route, beginning November 20 in Eugene, Oregon and heading north to Vancouver; east into Alberta; southeast through the Western United States into Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas; then westward for stops in Albuquerque, Phoenix, and San Diego before doubling back through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma; on through the Southern United States; then finally up the East Coast, ending January 16 in Richmond, Virginia having covered 21 states and 2 provinces with a total of 45 shows in 40 cities.

== Reception ==
Jeremy Salmon of Allmusic gave the album two stars out of five, remarking that &quot;Highbrow humor was never a signature of the Descendents, but the toilet-themed album &quot;Enjoy!&quot; is a bit much.&quot; He criticized the scatological humor of &quot;Enjoy&quot;, &quot;Orgofart&quot;, and the album&#x27;s artwork, and called the heavy metal-styled &quot;Days Are Blood&quot; and &quot;Orgo 51&quot; &quot;disposable&quot;, but noted the similarly heavy &quot;Hürtin&#x27; Crüe&quot; as an exception worthy of its inclusion on the band&#x27;s best-of album &quot;Somery&quot;. Despite the weaker tracks, he noted that &quot;Enjoy!&quot; includes several songs central to the Descendents&#x27; repertoire, including &quot;Kids&quot;, &quot;Wendy&quot;, and &quot;Sour Grapes&quot;, calling the album &quot;a fine metaphor for the history of the Descendents; no matter what turbulence befell the band, some excellent songs were still able to seep through anything that clogged.&quot; Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Enjoy!&quot; &quot;weak overall, due in part to [original bassist Tony Lombardo&#x27;s] departure, though mostly because of the scatological humor on the title track (&#x27;Sniff my ass while I pass gas&#x27;, goes but one pearl.) The album is rescued by a cover of The Beach Boys&#x27; &#x27;Wendy&#x27; and the band&#x27;s own &#x27;Sour Grapes&#x27;, on which Auckerman gets rejected by a snooty new-wave girl.&quot;

Some friends of the band were more complimentary of the album. Dave Naz of Chemical People later remarked that &quot;&quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; is probably the record you identify most with the band, maybe, but &quot;Enjoy!&quot; is like, &#x27;Wow!&#x27; I don&#x27;t want to say they polished their sound, but they kind of took it to another level. I think that album best represents them. There&#x27;s a lot of farting, and that goes on when you&#x27;re hanging out with those guys.&quot; Robert Hecker of Redd Kross cites &quot;Get the Time&quot; as one of his favorite songs: &quot;I regularly lump it in my top three greatest songs in pop music of all time, with &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27; and &#x27;Under Pressure&#x27;. It&#x27;s perfect. It is a perfect song. And maybe if [the album] didn&#x27;t have a toilet paper roll on the cover, it could have sold 20 million copies.&quot;

== Cover versions ==
In the decades since its release, several artists have recorded cover versions of songs from &quot;Enjoy!&quot; for other releases. For the Descendents tribute album &quot;Homage: Lots of Bands Doing Descendents&#x27; Songs&quot; (1995), Inch covered &quot;Kids&quot;, Dooms UK covered &quot;Sour Grapes&quot;, Snowplow covered &quot;Cheer&quot;, Wally covered &quot;Get the Time&quot;, and Scarab covered &quot;Green&quot;. Saves the Day covered &quot;Cheer&quot; on &quot;Ups &amp; Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides&quot; (2004). Good Riddance covered &quot;Sour Grapes&quot; for &quot;Milo Turns 50: Songs of the Descendents&quot; (2013).

<text>Penngrove is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sonoma County, California, United States, situated between the cities of Petaluma and Cotati, at the foot of the western flank of Sonoma Mountain. It is part of the North Bay subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area. The population was 2,522 at the 2010 census.

The area is the site of a historic grove called Penn&#x27;s Grove; it was formerly a freight station on the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and a center of egg and chicken farming.

==Geography==
Penngrove&#x27;s downtown consists of Main Street, a street linking Old Redwood Highway to Adobe Road. Penngrove School is located at the corner of Adobe Road, where Main Street becomes Petaluma Hill Road.

Lichau Creek flows southward through the town, paralleling the railway. The creek feeds into the Petaluma River, which flows to San Pablo Bay.

Due to the Sonoma Mountain&#x27;s ancient volcanism, Penngrove is rich with obsidian and petrified wood. Its soil is unique, composed mainly of clay-like adobe, which has been used for centuries as building material. A prime example of adobe architecture is the Rancho Petaluma Adobe, a State Historic Park in nearby Petaluma.

Penngrove enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of , all of it land.

==Demographics==
The 2010 United States Census reported that Penngrove had a population of 2,522. The population density was . The racial makeup of Penngrove was 2,212 (87.7%) White, 19 (0.8%) African American, 24 (1.0%) Native American, 54 (2.1%) Asian, 2 (0.1%) Pacific Islander, 112 (4.4%) from other races, and 99 (3.9%) from two or more races.

The homeowner vacancy rate was 1.4%; the rental vacancy rate was 3.1%. 64.6% of the population lived in owner-occupied housing units and 35.0% lived in rental housing units.

==History==
The Mexican government granted Rancho Cotate to Captain Juan Castaneda in July 1844 for his military services in the region. The grant encompassed present-day Penngrove, Cotati and Rohnert Park. Cotate Rancho is a part of Vallejo Township which encompasses the plain between Sonoma Mountain and Petaluma Creek, San Pablo Bay, with an east–west line dividing the tract from Santa Rosa Township.&quot;

Rancho Cotate was sold in 1849 to Dr. Thomas S. Page of Cotati, and eventually broken up and sold off piecemeal to incoming settlers.

The first European settlers in the Penngrove area were David Wharff, W.J. Hardin, and J.M. Palmer, who arrived in 1852.

In October 1870, the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad completed the first railroad from Petaluma to Santa Rosa, running through Penngrove.

==Culture==
Every summer on the Sunday closest to July 4, Penngrove celebrates the 4th of July with a parade sponsored by the Penngrove Social Firemen. On Saturday at the Penngrove Fire Station, located at the corner of Main Street and Old Redwood Highway, the Rancho Adobe Firefighters&#x27; Association sponsors a breakfast.

==Education==
It is in the Petaluma City Elementary School District and the Petaluma Joint Union High School District.

==Name==
The naming of Penngrove is uncertain; there are three main &quot;histories&quot; of the name&#x27;s origin. 

Ruth Anderson, the famous &quot;Bell-Lady&quot; of Penngrove (who lived on the site of the old schoolhouse on Oak Street), recalls,
&quot;In the late 1860s, two brothers by the name of Penn came out from Pennsylvania and bought of land in this area. They planted the area with olive trees, but when the trees matured it was found that the olives were not edible. The Penn brothers tore out many of the groves, sold the land and moved away. However, while they were here, they named their place Penn&#x27;s Grove. Later it was changed to &quot;Penn Grove,&quot; and still later, because our mail got confused with that of Pine Grove (the former name of Sebastopol), the U.S. Postoffice Department changed the name to one word—Penngrove.&quot; (Harris 1980)

Other accounts state that because there was another town with the name of Penn&#x27;s Grove in New Jersey, this could be a reason as to why the post office changed the name. Others claim that the Woodward family, who came from Pennsylvania, named their property Penn&#x27;s Grove in honor of their home state.

==Community development==
Along with the chicken and egg industry, Penngrove was a source of basalt paving stones, which were used to pave the streets of major cities in the Bay Area, including San Francisco. Harris notes that 200 men were employed at the three major cobblestone quarries at the end of the 19th century, and that quarry scars can still be seen dotting the hills between East Railroad Avenue and Roberts Road. When the Northwestern Pacific Railroad was completed in 1870, the paving stone industry kept Penngrove station busy. After the turn of the century, Penngrove became the &quot;second largest egg and poultry producing area in the country. Only Petaluma outdid this area&quot; (Harris 1980). Apparently, according to &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, chickens paid better than gold mines. To this day, many dilapidated chicken houses dot old farms and country roads in the area.

==Notable landmarks==

===Penngrove Community Church===
One of the oldest buildings in Penngrove, the old Methodist Episcopal Church was built in 1898 at the corner of Formschlag Lane and Petaluma Hill Road. In 1910, the church was moved on wooden rollers to its present location at 9970 Oak Street. The original building now serves as a fellowship hall, while a newer structure, built in 1955–1957, now serves as the main sanctuary. The original structure is still used by Girl Scouts of the USA, Boy Scouts of America, 4-H, and various other community organizations.

===Penngrove School===
The first classes were taught in a small building on Peters&#x27; Ranch (Harris 1980: 33). In 1876, the first school was built at the southwest corner of Adobe Road and Main Street. It was named the Eagle School after the Eagle Hotel located across Main Street and shown on Thompson&#x27;s map of Sonoma County (1877). In 1906 after construction of the second Eagle School, the old school was used as a teacher&#x27;s residence. It was later moved about south to its current location and reconfigured into an ell. The second Eagle School was built between Main and Oak streets. The original structure no longer exists, and a private home now stands on that property, however, the steps leading to &quot;Eagle School&quot; from Main Street are still visible. Some of building materials were recycled for construction of the Community Center and a small building in Penngrove Park. In 1926 a beautiful mission-style school house was built and named Penngrove School, Eagle District. Penngrove School joined the Petaluma City School District in 1962. In 1963, the present multi-purpose room was constructed and newer wings were developed between it and the older portion of the school. The multi-purpose room was expanded with a stage in 2006. The 1926 school building is now primarily used for offices and the school library.

===Post Office===
&quot;The Post Office at Penn&#x27;s Grove was established on October 30, 1882. A series of name changes occurred because of mail mix-ups with Penn&#x27;s Grove, New Jersey and Pine Grove (later renamed Sebastopol). In May 1895 the Petaluma paper reported: &#x27;The Penngrove Post Office has had its name changed again and is now officially known by its former and best known title, Penn&#x27;s Grove.&#x27; In 1908 the name was changed back to Penngrove and has remained so since&quot; (Harris 1980).
The first Post Office was located in the Edwards Building and was then moved into the Terribilini Building on the East side of Main Street. It was then moved next to Penngrove Market and a new structure for the Post Office was built in the 1980s on Main Street across from Penngrove Market.

===Fire Department===
At the turn of the century, three fire chemical carts served as Penngrove&#x27;s fire protection. The foundation of Firehouse #1 can be found between Penngrove Church and the Old Eagle School lot on Oak Street. &quot;The fire department was established in the fall of 1928. In 1929 the first fire engine was put into service&quot; (Harris 1980). In 1938, the art deco fire house was built on Woodward Avenue, just above Main Street. This structure still bears the title &quot;Penngrove Firehouse.&quot; It is a now a private residence. In 1975, the current firehouse was built at the corner of Old Redwood Highway and Main Street, the unofficial entrance to Penngrove. Until the 1990s, a siren placed at the top of the building would sound in order to alert volunteer firefighters of a fire. The siren had a greater than radius and could be heard frequently through the hot, dry summer months. This system was replaced by pagers in the 1990s, although the siren remains perched on top of the firehouse. Currently, the Penngrove Firehouse is part of the Rancho Adobe Fire District, along with Cotati and other surrounding communities.

===Penngrove Community Club House===

&quot;During World War I, a group of Penngrove ladies met in Evart&#x27;s Hall to do Red Cross work. After the war they decided they wanted to stay together as a group and have a club house of their own&quot; (Harris 1980: 33). In 1922, after raising funds and materials, Penngrove came together to build the Community Club House. The total cost was $9,000. The building was first named the &quot;Penngrove Social Welfare Club House&quot;, but was later shortened to Penngrove Women&#x27;s Club House. After a fire destroyed portions of the building in the late 1970s and the Women&#x27;s Club could no longer afford the upkeep, the Penngrove Social Firemen bought the building. It is now used for various community events, such as voting and fundraisers.

===Bank Building===

&quot;The Bank Building was built in 1922 for the Central Commercial and Savings Bank. The bank lasted only 2 or 3 years. The bank manager and his family lived upstairs&quot; (Harris 1980: 48).

===Penngrove Rail Station===

The Penngrove Rail Station burned to the ground in 1980, and nothing of it survives. The poultry loading docks still exist behind Penngrove Market, adjacent to Penngrove Park, and now house businesses.

<text>The Cobbler () is an mountain located near the head of Loch Long in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It is a Corbett, and is an important site for rock climbing in the Southern Highlands. Many maps include the name Ben Arthur (an anglicisation of the Gaelic), but the name &quot;The Cobbler&quot; is more widely used. In the 19th century it was referred to as &quot;The Cobbler and his Wife&quot;.

==Arrochar Alps==
The mountain is part of the Arrochar Alps. It is named for its large rocky summit features which are supposed to represent a cobbler bending over his last. The features are visible many miles away from the mountain. Despite the mountain falling short of Munro height, due to its summit features and ease of access, it is one of the most popular mountains in Scotland.

==Three summits==

The Cobbler has three summits: the middle one is the highest. The top is crowned by a rocky outcrop that marks the true summit.

The three summits are tightly grouped around a small corrie (glacial cirque), but their form is due to large-scale landslipping, not ice erosion. The North Peak is deeply fissured, with climbing routes caving up through it. The Summit and South Peak are the remnants of a ridge which has visibly slipped away into Glen Croe, making much of the west side hazardous or impassable.

==Available paths==
The most common route starts from the village of Succoth, at the head of Loch Long. Originally, the route first headed directly up the hillside, following the remains of an old tramway built as part of a water collection scheme. A newly constructed path has now been built, by-passing the tramway and zig-zagging up the hillside to give a more gentle ascent through an area of forestry. This path meets up with the old tramway path and continues from there, following a burn (stream) known as the Allt a&#x27; Bhalachain. From here the path bypasses the Narnain Boulders, steepening at around . Nearer the top, the path flattens out at a &quot;&quot; (mountain pass), which is marked by a cairn. Several peaks may be accessed from this point.

Beside the route described above, the summits may also be reached starting from the A83 &quot;Rest-and-be-Thankful&quot; road through Glen Croe to the west, by following the rocky south-eastern ridge up from Loch Long, or from the Bealach a&#x27; Mhàim. This &quot;bealach&quot;, at , allows Ben Arthur to be combined with some of the other Arrochar Alps, such as Beinn Narnain and Beinn Ìme.

==Climbing==
The Cobbler is the most important site for rock climbing in the Southern Highlands, and Scotland&#x27;s first climbing club was the Cobbler Club, founded in 1866.

<text>This is a list of currently available photographic films in a still camera film format. This includes recently discontinued films that remain available from stock at main suppliers. Films are listed by brand name. Still camera photographic films no longer in production (or available) are included in the &quot;list of discontinued photographic films&quot;.

P - Polyester base; T- Triacetate base; SUC-27/39 - Single use camera with 27/39 exposures.

==ADOX==

The current rights to the historic ADOX name were obtained in 2003 by Fotoimpex of Berlin, Germany, a company founded in 1992 to import photographic films and papers from the former Eastern Bloc. ADOX (Fotoimpex) subsequently established a film factory in Bad Sarrow outside Berlin to convert and package films, papers and chemicals. In February 2015 they acquired use of the former Ilford Imaging (Ciba Geigy) machine E, medium scale coating line at Marly, Switzerland. From 2017 to 2018 they doubled the size of the Bad Sarrow factory to be able to install film coating capability (still in progress in 2024) and medium scale photochemistry manufacture.

The ADOX name traces back to the oldest photographic film manufacturer in the world, started in 1860 in Germany. In the 1970s, Dupont the owners of the Adox brand sold the recipes and machinery of their B&amp;W films to Fotokemika in Croatia who continued to produce the films under the Efke brand. The films were subsequently imported by Fotoimpex and sold as ADOX CHS Art thus re-uniting the ADOX name with the films. After Fotokemikas closure in 2012, ADOX CHS II was produced for ADOX using modern cascade coating and since then the range of products has been expanded.

==AgfaPhoto==
The AGFA consumer film division with its plant in Leverkusen, Germany was spun off by Agfa-Gevaert into a new company AGFA PHOTO in 2004. At buy out the firm was split into a holding company Agfa-Photo Holding GMBH (licenses) and manufacturing company Agfa-Photo GMBH (leverkusen). The manufacturing company went bankrupt in 7 months resulting in the closure of the Leverkusen plant in 2005. The holding company was unaffected and retains a trademark license from Agfa-Gevaert for the use of the AgfaPhoto brand and &#x27;red dot&#x27; logo on products having a photographic application. Since 2005 these rights for consumer film products have been sub-licensed to Lupus Imaging &amp; Media. The color negative and slide films were made by Ferrania from 2005, whilst black and white films were converted by Ferrania from stored master rolls of AGFA stock. Ferrania closed in 2009. Replacement color films were supplied by Fujifilm until this contract ended in early 2018, ending the sale of color film under the AgfaPhoto brand. Black &amp; White films were replaced by new films made by Harman Technology after 2013.

<text>Cabreúva is a municipality (&quot;município&quot;) in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 50,429 (2020 est.) in an area of 260.23 km2. The elevation is 640 m. The city takes its name from the Cabreúva tree (&quot;Myrocarpus frondosus&quot;), known as &quot;Kaburé-Iwa&quot; (&quot;owl tree&quot;) in Tupi language.

==History==

The city was established in the beginning of the 18th century by a member of the Martins e Ramos family, from the city of Itu, who followed the Tietê River to this place in a valley between the three mountains &quot;Japi&quot;, &quot;Guaxatuba&quot; and &quot;Taguá&quot;. Sugar cane was planted in the area for distilled beverage production, which earned the city its nickname &quot;Terra da Pinga&quot;.

==Geography==

The landscape is dominated by the mountains (Japi, Guaxatuba and Taguá) and the Tietê river. The altitudes vary between 640 m in the center of the city up to 1,200 m Serra do Japi. The area of the city is 260 km2, of which 96 km2 are urban and 165 km2 are rural.

==Population history==
==Demographics==

According to the 2000 IBGE Census, the population was 33,100, of which 25,760 are urban and 7,340 are rural. The life expectancy was 71.14 years. The literacy rate was 90.05%.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1093496" wikidata="Q333521" url="?curid=1093496" title="Nassim Nicholas Taleb">
<text>Nassim Nicholas Taleb (; alternatively &quot;Nessim &quot;or&quot; Nissim&quot;; born 12 September 1960) is a Lebanese-American essayist, mathematical statistician, former option trader, risk analyst, and aphorist. His work concerns problems of randomness, probability, complexity, and uncertainty.

Taleb is the author of the &quot;Incerto&quot;, a five-volume work on the nature of uncertainty published between 2001 and 2018 (notably, &quot;The Black Swan&quot; and &quot;Antifragile&quot;). He has taught at several universities, serving as a Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering since September 2008. He has also been a practitioner of mathematical finance and is currently an adviser at Universa Investments. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; described his 2007 book &quot;The Black Swan&quot; as one of the 12 most influential books since World War II.

Taleb criticized risk management methods used by the finance industry and warned about financial crises, subsequently profiting from the Black Monday (1987) and the 2007–2008 financial crisis. He advocates what he calls a &quot;black swan robust&quot; society, meaning a society that can withstand difficult-to-predict events. He proposes what he has termed &quot;antifragility&quot; in systems; that is, an ability to benefit and grow from a certain class of random events, errors, and volatility, as well as &quot;convex tinkering&quot; as a method of scientific discovery, by which he means that decentralized experimentation outperforms directed research.

==Early life and family background==

Taleb was born in Amioun, Lebanon, to Minerva Ghosn and Nagib Taleb, an oncologist and a researcher in anthropology. His parents were Greek Orthodox Christians, and had French citizenship. His maternal grandfather and great-grandfather were both deputy prime ministers of Lebanon in the 1940s through the 1970s, and his four-times great grandfather was one of the board of directors to the administrator of Mount Lebanon. His paternal grandfather Nassim Taleb was a supreme court judge. Taleb attended a French school in Beirut, the Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais. His family saw its political prominence and wealth reduced by the Lebanese Civil War, which began in 1975. He is a Greek Orthodox Christian.

==Education==
Taleb received Bachelor and Master of Science degrees from the University of Paris. He holds an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (1983), and a PhD in management science from the University of Paris (Dauphine) (1998), under the direction of Hélyette Geman. His dissertation focused on the mathematics of derivatives pricing.

== Career ==
=== Finance ===
Taleb has been a practitioner of mathematical finance as a hedge fund manager, and a derivatives trader. He has held the following positions: managing director and proprietary trader at Credit Suisse UBS, currency trader at First Boston, chief currency derivatives trader for Banque Indosuez, managing director and worldwide head of financial option arbitrage at CIBC Wood Gundy, derivatives arbitrage trader at Bankers Trust (now Deutsche Bank), proprietary trader at BNP Paribas, independent option market maker on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and hedge fund manager for Empirica Capital.

Taleb reportedly became financially independent after the crash of 1987 from his hedged short Eurodollar position while working as a trader for First Boston. Next, Taleb pursued work toward his PhD in Paris, completing the degree program in 1998. He returned to New York City and founded Empirica Capital in 1999. During the market downturn in 2000, at the end of the dot com bubble and burst, Empirica&#x27;s Empirica Kurtosis LLC fund was reported to have made a 56.86% return. Taleb&#x27;s investing strategies continued to be highly successful during the Nasdaq dive in 2000 Several consecutive years of low market volatility and less spectacular returns followed, and Empirica closed in 2004.
In 2007, Taleb joined his former Empirica partner, Mark Spitznagel, as an adviser to Universa Investments, an asset management company based on the &quot;black swan&quot; idea, owned and managed by Spitznagel in Miami, Florida. 

Taleb attributed the 2007–2008 financial crisis, to the mismatch between reality and statistical distributions used in finance. Taleb&#x27;s investing approach produced significant returns once again, with some Universa funds returning 65% to 115% in October 2008. In a 2007 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, Taleb claimed he retired from trading and would be a full-time author. He describes the nature of his involvement as &quot;totally passive&quot; from 2010 on.

Taleb considers himself less a businessman than an epistemologist of randomness, and says that he used trading to attain independence and freedom from authority. He advocated for tail risk hedging, which is intended to mitigate investors&#x27; exposure to extreme market moves. Tail risk hedging safeguards investors by reaping rewards from rare events, thus Taleb&#x27;s investment management career has included several jackpots followed by lengthy dry spells.

Taleb attended the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos in 2009; at that event he had harsh words for bankers, suggesting that bankers&#x27; recklessness will not be repeated &quot;if you have punishment&quot;.

=== Academia ===
Taleb shifted his career emphasis to mathematical research in 2006. Since 2008, he has taught classes at New York University Tandon School of Engineering, as Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering. and was a Distinguished Research Scholar at the Said Business School BT Center, University of Oxford from 2009 to 2013. Taleb also held positions at NYU&#x27;s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the London Business School.

Taleb is Co-Editor in Chief of the academic journal &quot;Risk and Decision Analysis&quot; since September 2014, jointly teaches regular courses with Paul Wilmott in London, and occasionally participates in teaching courses toward the Certificate in Quantitative Finance. He is also a faculty member of the New England Complex Systems Institute.

=== Writing career ===
Taleb&#x27;s first non-technical book, &quot;Fooled by Randomness&quot;, about the underestimation of the role of randomness in life, published in 2001, was selected by &quot;Fortune&quot; as one of the smartest 75 books known.

His second non-technical book, &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, about unpredictable events, was published in 2007, selling close to three million copies, as of February 2011. It spent 36 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list, 17 as hardcover and 19 weeks as paperback, and was translated into 50 languages. The book has been credited with predicting the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

In a 2008 article in &quot;The Times&quot;, journalist Bryan Appleyard described Taleb as &quot;the hottest thinker in the world&quot;. Daniel Kahneman proposed the inclusion of Taleb&#x27;s name among the world&#x27;s top intellectuals, saying &quot;Taleb has changed the way many people think about uncertainty, particularly in the financial markets. His book, &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, is an original and audacious analysis of the ways in which humans try to make sense of unexpected events.&quot;

A book of aphorisms, &quot;The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms&quot;, was released in December 2010.

&quot;Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder&quot; was published in November 2012 and &quot;Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life&quot; was published in February 2018.

Taleb&#x27;s five volume philosophical essay on uncertainty, titled Incerto, includes &quot;Fooled by Randomness&quot; (2001), &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (2007–2010), &quot;The Bed of Procrustes&quot; (2010), &quot;Antifragile&quot; (2012), and &quot;Skin in the Game&quot; (2018). It was originally published in November 2016 including only the first four books. The fifth book was added in August 2019.

Taleb&#x27;s non-technical writing style has been described as mixing a narrative, often semi-autobiographical style with short philosophical tales and historical and scientific commentary. The sales of Taleb&#x27;s first two books garnered an advance of $4 million, for a follow-up book on anti-fragility.

== Ideas and theories ==
Taleb&#x27;s book &quot;The Bed of Procrustes&quot; summarizes the central problem: &quot;we humans, facing limits of knowledge, and things we do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas&quot;. Taleb disagrees with Platonic (i.e., theoretical) approaches to reality to the extent that they lead people to have the wrong map of reality, rather than no map at all. He opposes most economic and grand social science theorizing, which in his view, suffers acutely from the problem of overuse of Plato&#x27;s theory of forms.

He has also proposed that biological, economic, and other systems exhibit an ability to benefit and grow from volatility—including particular types of random errors and events—a characteristic of these systems that he terms &quot;antifragility.&quot; Relatedly, he also believes that universities are better at public relations and claiming credit than generating knowledge. He argues that knowledge and technology are usually generated by what he calls &quot;stochastic tinkering&quot; rather than by top-down directed research, and has proposed option-like experimentation as a way to outperform directed research as a method of scientific discovery, an approach he terms &quot;convex tinkering.&quot;

Taleb has called for discontinuation of the Nobel Prize in Economics, saying that the damage from economic theories can be devastating. He opposes top-down knowledge as an academic illusion. Together with Espen Gaarder Haug, Taleb asserts that option pricing is determined in a &quot;heuristic way&quot; by market participants, not by a model, and that models are &quot;lecturing birds on how to fly&quot;. Teacher and author Pablo Triana has explored this topic with reference to Haug and Taleb. Triana has stated that Taleb might be correct in recommending that retail banks be treated as utilities, i.e. forbidden to take potentially disastrous risks, whereas hedge funds and other less-regulated investment entities need not be subject to similar restrictions.

In his writings, Taleb has identified and discussed the error of comparing real-world randomness with the &quot;structured randomness&quot; in quantum physics (where probabilities are computable) or games of chance such as casino gambling, in which the probabilities are purposefully constructed by casino management. Taleb calls this the &quot;ludic fallacy&quot;. He argues that predictive models suffer from Platonism, gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take certain key ideas into account such as the impossibility of possessing all relevant information; that small unknown variations in the data can have a huge impact; and flawed theories/models based on empirical data and that fail to consider events that have not taken place but could take place. Discussing the ludic fallacy in &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, he writes, &quot;The dark side of the moon is harder to see; beaming light on it costs energy. In the same way, beaming light on the unseen is costly, in both computational and mental effort.&quot;

In the second edition of &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, he posited that the foundations of quantitative economics are faulty and highly self-referential. He states that statistics is fundamentally incomplete as a field, as it cannot predict the risk of rare events, a problem that is acute in proportion to the rarity of these events. With the mathematician Raphael Douady, he called the problem &quot;statistical undecidability&quot; (Douady and Taleb, 2010).

Taleb has described his main challenge as mapping his ideas of &quot;robustification&quot; and &quot;antifragility&quot;, that is, how to live and act in a world we do not understand and build robustness to black swan events. Taleb introduced the idea of the &quot;fourth quadrant&quot; in the exposure domain. One of its applications is in his definition of the most effective (that is, least fragile) risk management approach: what he calls the &quot;barbell strategy&quot; which is based on avoiding the middle in favor of linear combination of extremes, across all domains from politics to economics to one&#x27;s personal life. These are deemed by Taleb to be more robust to estimation errors. For instance, he suggests that investing money in &#x27;medium risk&#x27; investments is pointless, because risk is difficult, if not impossible to compute. His preferred strategy is to be both hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive at the same time. For example, an investor might put 80 to 90% of their money in extremely safe instruments, such as treasury bills, with the remainder going into highly risky and diversified speculative bets. An alternative suggestion is to engage in highly speculative bets with a limited downside.

Taleb asserts that by adopting these strategies, a portfolio can be &quot;robust&quot;, i.e. gain a positive exposure to black swan events while limiting losses suffered by such random events. Together with Donald Geman and Hélyette Geman, he modeled a maximum entropy barbell &quot;to constrain only what can be constrained (in a robust manner) and to maximize entropy elsewhere&quot;, based on an insight by E. T. Jaynes that economic life increases in entropy under regulatory and other constraints. Taleb also applies a similar barbell-style approach to health and exercise. Instead of doing steady and moderate exercise daily, he suggests that it is better to do a low-effort exercise such as walking slowly most of the time, while occasionally expending extreme effort. He claims that the human body evolved to live in a random environment, with various unexpected but intense efforts and much rest.

Taleb appeared with Ron Paul and Ralph Nader on their respective shows in support of &quot;Skin in the Game&quot;, which was dedicated to both men. After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, however, Taleb publicly supported an aggressive response against Russia and denounced &quot;naive libertarians, who think I&#x27;m like them because they like my books.&quot;

Taleb wrote in Antifragile and in scientific papers that if the statistical structure of habits in modern society differ too greatly from the ancestral environment of humanity, the analysis of consumption should focus less on composition and more on frequency. In other words, studies that ignore the random nature of supply of nutrients are invalid.

Taleb&#x27;s scathing counter-intuitive takedown of widely-circulated alt-right talking points about race and IQ received both criticism and praise, when he published his &quot;IQ is largely a pseudo-scientific swindle&quot; on Medium. Posting a video on YouTube on the same topic, Taleb demonstrates that IQ as a test does not measure intelligence, which is a multi-factor phenomenon, but rather tests for the &quot;absence of stupidity&quot; or the &quot;presence of unintelligence.&quot; Taleb argues in the paper that not only is IQ unscientific, and not validated by any evidence, it is additionally immoral and racist, calling national IQ rankings &quot;a complete fraud.&quot; 

Taleb authored a paper with Yaneer Bar-Yam and Joseph Norman called &quot;Systemic risk of pandemic via novel pathogens – Coronavirus: A note&quot;. The paper, published on 26 January 2020, took the position that the SARS-CoV-2 was not being taken seriously enough by policy makers and medical professionals.

== Criticism and reactions ==
Aaron Brown, a quantitative analyst and adjunct professor, said regarding &quot;The Black Swan&quot; that &quot;the book reads as if Taleb has never heard of nonparametric methods, data analysis, visualization tools or robust estimation.&quot; Nonetheless, he calls the book &quot;essential reading&quot; and urges statisticians to overlook the insults to get the &quot;important philosophic and mathematical truths.&quot; Taleb replied in the second edition of &quot;The Black Swan&quot; that &quot;One of the most common (but useless) comments I hear is that some solutions can come from &#x27;robust statistics.&#x27; I wonder how using these techniques can create information where there is none&quot;. In 2007, Westfall and Hilbe complained that Taleb&#x27;s criticism is &quot;often unfounded and sometimes outrageous.&quot; Taleb, writes John Kay, &quot;describes writers and professionals as knaves or fools, mostly fools ... Yet beneath his rage and mockery are serious issues. The risk management models in use today exclude the very events against which they claim to protect the businesses that employ them. These models import a veneer of technical sophistication ... &quot; Berkeley statistician David Freedman said that efforts by statisticians to refute Taleb&#x27;s stance have been unconvincing.

Taleb contends that statisticians can be pseudoscientists when it comes to risks of rare events and risks of blowups, and mask their incompetence with complicated equations. This stance has attracted criticism: the American Statistical Association devoted the August 2007 issue of &quot;The American Statistician&quot; to &quot;The Black Swan&quot;. The magazine offered a mixture of praise and criticism for Taleb&#x27;s main points, with a focus on Taleb&#x27;s writing style and his representation of the statistical literature. Robert Lund, a mathematics professor at Clemson University, writes that in &quot;Black Swan&quot;, Taleb is &quot;reckless at times and subject to grandiose overstatements; the professional statistician will find the book ubiquitously naive.&quot; However, Lund acknowledges that &quot;there are many points where I agree with Taleb,&quot; and writes that &quot;the book is a must&quot; for anyone &quot;remotely interested in finance and/or philosophical probability.&quot;

Taleb and Nobel laureate Myron Scholes have traded personal attacks, particularly after Taleb&#x27;s paper with , in which Taleb alleged that nobody uses the Black–Scholes–Merton formula. Taleb accused Scholes of being responsible for the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and suggested that &quot;this guy should be in a retirement home doing Sudoku. His funds have blown up twice. He shouldn&#x27;t be allowed in Washington to lecture anyone on risk.&quot; Scholes retorted that Taleb simply &quot;popularises ideas and is making money selling books&quot;. Scholes claimed that Taleb does not cite previous literature, and for this reason Taleb is not taken seriously in academia. Haug and Taleb (2011) listed hundreds of research documents showing the Black–Scholes formula was not derived by Scholes, and argued that the economics establishment ignored literature by practitioners and mathematicians such as Ed Thorp, who many years earlier, had developed a more sophisticated version of the formula.

Taleb&#x27;s outspoken and directed commentary against parts of the finance industry—e.g., saying at Davos in 2009 that he was &quot;happy&quot; that Lehman Brothers collapsed—was followed by reports of threats and personal attacks.

Taleb is known for his uncensored criticism of public figures and institutions. He has referred to former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair as &quot;a very dishonourable fellow&quot; and Blair&#x27;s successor, Gordon Brown as &quot;an idiot&quot;. He has criticized prominent economists like Larry Summers, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, stating that &quot;they cause more crises than they solve&quot;. He has also been critical of the World Economic Forum at Davos, calling it the &quot;International Association of Namedroppers&quot; and stating &quot;they think it&#x27;s their mission to solve a problem they don&#x27;t understand.&quot;

<text>Victoria E. Snelgrove (October 29, 1982 – October 21, 2004) was an American journalism student at Emerson College in Boston, who died after being shot by officer Rochefort Milien of the Boston Police Department using a less-lethal weapon. The shooting took place following the victory of the Boston Red Sox over the New York Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series. In 2005, the city of Boston reached a $5.1 million wrongful death settlement with Snelgrove&#x27;s family. After filing a wrongful death suit for $10 million against FN Herstal (the manufacturer of the weapon), the family agreed to an out-of-court settlement in June of 2006; the final amount of the settlement was not disclosed.

==Killing==
In the early hours of October 21, 2004, after the Boston Red Sox defeated the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium in Game 7 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, the Boston Police Department took action around Fenway Park to control a crowd that had gathered, some of whom were throwing bottles at the police. Approximately 90 minutes after the game ended, officer Rochefort Milien shot Snelgrove with an FN 303 blunt trauma / pepper spray projectile. Snelgrove, who was not acting in an unruly manner, was not Milien&#x27;s intended target; he had fired at a different person in the crowd. The crowd-control projectile hit Snelgrove in the eye, causing her to bleed heavily. Ambulances were blocked by the excessive crowds, which still refused to clear the area, preventing prompt medical attention from arriving from the dense medical area only a half-mile (0.8 km) away.

Snelgrove died at 12:50 p.m. EDT at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, about 11 hours after being shot. According to the autopsy, the pellet opened a three-quarter-inch (1.9 cm) hole in the bone behind the eye, broke into nine pieces, and damaged the right side of her brain.

Boston&#x27;s Police Commissioner, Kathleen O&#x27;Toole, placed Milien on paid leave. O&#x27;Toole later attended the hour-long funeral on October 26, 2004, at St. John&#x27;s Catholic Church in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, along with Mayor of Boston Thomas Menino and Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney.

==Investigation and aftermath==
Commissioner O&#x27;Toole accepted the police department&#x27;s responsibility, while condemning the &quot;punks&quot; who participated in the near-riot. The investigation into Snelgrove&#x27;s death was led by Donald K. Stern, a former United States Attorney best known for prosecuting mob figures, including fugitive Winter Hill Gang leader James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger. Through the investigation, Officer Milien was identified as the person who fired the shot that killed Snelgrove. The report from the investigation outlined 12 recommendations for the Boston Police Department, including a review of use-of-force policies and improved training for less-lethal weapons. On May 2, 2005, the city of Boston announced a $5.1 million wrongful death settlement for her family&#x27;s lawsuit.

On September 12, 2005, the district attorney for Suffolk County, Daniel F. Conley, announced that he would not prosecute any of the officers involved. Four days later, Commissioner O&#x27;Toole demoted the police superintendent who was in charge the night of the shooting to captain and suspended two officers, including Milien, for 45 days without pay. The deputy superintendent outside Fenway Park at the time of the incident was also criticized for poor decisions that led to Snelgrove&#x27;s death, but had already retired. Milien retired from the Boston Police Department on February 29, 2020.

The weapon that killed Snelgrove was manufactured by Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN Herstal). Because of the incident, several police forces, such as the Seattle Police Department, discontinued use of this weapon. In June of 2006, a $10 million wrongful death suit between FN Herstal and the Snelgrove family was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Boston police never used their FN 303s again, and destroyed them in 2007, stating that they were more powerful and lethal than had been anticipated.

==Memorials==
Stephen King and Stewart O&#x27;Nan dedicated their book &quot;Faithful&quot; (2004) to Snelgrove; the dedication reads simply: &quot;For Victoria Snelgrove, Red Sox fan.&quot; Red Sox outfielder Trot Nixon stated that he would have traded Game 7 of the 2004 ALCS to have her back.

Snelgrove&#x27;s parents established the Victoria Snelgrove Memorial Fund, &quot;a non-profit organization to carry forward her spirit and concern for others,&quot; which awards scholarships to students at East Bridgewater High School and Emerson College. In April 2018, a skatepark in East Bridgewater was opened and named after Snelgrove.

<doc id="1093499" wikidata="Q1391474" url="?curid=1093499" title="Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg">
<text>Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg (1150 – 22 February 1217), also called Yehuda HeHasid or Judah the Pious in Hebrew, was a leader of the Ashkenazi Hasidim a movement of Jewish mysticism in Germany (not to be confused with the 18th-century Hasidic Judaism founded by the Baal Shem Tov).
Judah was born in 1150 in the small town of Speyer, now in the Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, but later settled in Regensburg, now in Bavaria, in 1195. He wrote much of &quot;Sefer Hasidim&quot; &quot;Book of the Pious&quot;, as well as a work about Gematria and &quot;Sefer Hakavod&quot; (Book of Glory), the latter has been lost and is only known by quotations that other authors have made from it. His most prominent students were Elazar Rokeach, Isaac ben Moses of Vienna author of &quot;Or Zarua&quot; and perhaps also Moses ben Jacob of Coucy according to Chaim Yosef David Azulai.

==Biography==
Judah was descended from an old family of kabbalists from Northern Italy that had settled in Germany. His grandfather Kalonymus ben Isaac the Elder was a scholar and parnas in Speyer (died 1126). His father Samuel, also called &quot;HeHasid&quot; &quot;the Pious&quot;, &quot;HaKadosh&quot; &quot;the Holy&quot;, and &quot;HaNabi&quot; &quot;the Prophet&quot;, was president of a bet midrash in Speyer, and from him Judah, together with his brother Abraham, received his early instruction. Samuel died while Judah was still young. About 1195 he left Speyer and settled in Regensburg (Ratisbon), on account of an &quot;accident&quot; – most probably a ritual murder accusation Feb. 13 1195 (see e.g. Israel Yuval: Two Nations in Your Womb (2006) p. 171) and the following persecution experienced by the Jews of Speyer.

He founded a yeshiva in Regensburg and secured many pupils. Among those who became famous were Eleazar of Worms, author of the &quot;Roqeaḥ&quot;; Isaac ben Moses of Vienna, author of &quot;Or Zarua&quot;; and Baruch ben Samuel of Mainz, author of &quot;Sefer ha-Ḥokmah&quot;. Eleazar applies to his teacher in several passages terms expressive of the highest esteem, such as &quot;father of wisdom&quot;.

Judah left one son, Moses Zaltman, author of a commentary on several parts of the Bible. Some scholars think that this Moses Zaltman, Zlatman or Blatman was in reality Rabbi Moses ben Yoel of Regensburg. It has been erroneously supposed that Judah had two other sons, Aaron and David.

He died on Shabbat Zachor. According to MS Guenzburg 109 f. 73r, &quot;he was buried in the holy city of Regensburg and I, [Menahem] Ullendorf ben Naftali, visited his grave on Tisha b&#x27;Av of [1471] and signed my name upon his tombstone.&quot;

Judah he-Ḥasid has often been confused with Judah ben Isaac Messer Leon of Paris, who is also called &quot;HeḤasid&quot;, which is nothing but an honorable title usual in his age. The fact that French words are to be found in the &quot;Book of the Pious&quot; and that it reflects French conditions caused Grätz also to attribute its authorship to Judah Sir Leon HeḤasid. But the reasons given by Grätz are not tenable.
===Legends of his life===
Legend describes Judah as an excellent bowman who at the age of eighteen was ignorant of the daily prayers. When, however, enlightenment suddenly came upon him he performed many miracles. He restored fertility to a young married woman. The prophet Elijah is said to have partaken of his Seder meal and to have been seen by him in a synagogue. He miraculously prevented a Jewish child from being baptized and knew the exact year of Israel&#x27;s redemption. He maintained communications with the Bishop of Salzburg and acted as seer for the Duke of Regensburg.

==Writings==

It is rather difficult to determine in what the new and important departure ascribed to him by legend consisted, since the obscurity spread over his works is as impenetrable as that surrounding his life. We know little of his study of the Talmud. Occasionally a halakhic writing, &quot;Gan Bosem&quot;, is quoted as his; a decision of his is found in Samson ben Zadok&#x27;s &quot;Sefer Tašbaṣ&quot; § 219, in Isaac ben Moses of Vienna&#x27;s &quot;Or Zarua&quot;, and in Meïr Rothenburg&#x27;s collection of responsa; and he is found in correspondence with celebrated halakhists of his age.

His commentary on the Torah, written down by his pupils after his lectures, was known only by citations in later commentaries. Yet, in 1975, Rabbi I. S. Langa has published Judah&#x27;s commentary on the Pentateuch, but he was forced to publish a second censored edition, due to claims about interpolations and modifications made in the composition of the Torah (on Gen. 48:20; Lev. 2:13; Deu. 2:8). Eran Viezel has argued that these claims were made by R. Moshe Zaltman, the son of R. Judah he-Hasid, rather than Judah himself.

===Liturgy===
He composed liturgical songs, but the authenticity of those attributed to him is uncertain. As regards his &quot;Shir Hayichud&quot; (seven parts; the eighth is called &quot;Shir HaKavod&quot;), printed in Tiengen, 1560, there is very great divergence of opinion, and the question of its authorship is still undecided. According to Zunz, it seems to be genuine, as do also his prayer &quot;Yechabeh Dim`ati&quot; and his selicha &quot;Gadol Yichudcha Elohim Beyisrael&quot;. More probably, according to the sources, his father, or a certain Samuel Ḥazzan, who died as a martyr at Erfurt in 1121, composed the &quot;Shir ha-Yiḥud&quot;, and Judah himself wrote a commentary on it. Several prayers are erroneously attributed to Judah; e.g., Zunz wrongly ascribes to him the alphabetical &quot;teḥinnah&quot; &quot;Ezkera Yom Moti&quot;. He wrote also commentaries on several parts of the daily prayers and on the Maḥzor.

Judah collected the notes of travel of his fellow citizen Petachiah of Regensburg, though incompletely and without any order. His chief literary work was an ethical and mystical one. Undoubtedly genuine is his &quot;Sefer HaKavod&quot;, which is mentioned by his pupils. Although there is some doubt, it is generally accepted that the person who wrote ethical will &quot;Tzava&#x27;at Rabbi Yehudah Hechasid&quot;, printed in 1583 and translated into Judæo-German, Prague, seventeenth to eighteenth century was Harav Yehuda HeChasid Shapiro. This testament contained regulations regarding the dead (§§ 1-15), the building of houses (§§ 16-21), matrimony (§§ 22-32), prohibited marriages between stepbrothers and stepsisters and between cousins, and various customs and superstitious prescriptions (§§ 33-end).

He was also a student, of one of the authors of Tosafot, and was the teacher of Meir of Rothenburg. He also taught Isaac ben Moses of Vienna (author of the &quot;Or Zarua&quot;) and Moses ben Jacob of Coucy (author of the &quot;Semag&quot;). Some say all the items in the will were written through Holy Spirit. Some commentaries go so far as to say that none of the Biblical prophets came to his level. Many people are very careful with all the items listed in the will. Some say one who is not careful with the items in the tzavaah will have to give a &quot;din&quot; and &quot;heshbon&quot; (account). The reason why the will is generally not brought in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; is because the dangers mentioned in it and the Gemara are real dangers, while the items in the will are not real dangers, but things which one must distance himself from.

There are also ascribed to Judah an astrological work, &quot;Gemaṭriot&quot;, handed down by his pupils and seen by Chaim Azulai, and &quot;Sefer ha-Ḥokhmah&quot;, on prayers and customs and the writing of scrolls of the Law.

===Sefer Hasidim===
The principal work with which Judah&#x27;s name is connected is &quot;Sefer Hasidim&quot;. The book contains ethical, ascetic, and mystical teachings, intermingled with elements of German popular belief. &quot;Sefer Hasidim&quot; is not a uniform work, nor is it the product of one author. Parts of it have been attributed to Samuel of Speyer and Eleazar of Worms, as well as to Judah himself.

==Mysticism==
The precise importance of Judah ben Samuel is somewhat difficult to determine. Side by side with the official, dogmatic religion of the Synagogue there has always existed a mysticism dealing more largely and more intimately with the personal relation of the individual to God, which at times was in opposition to the religion of the Synagogue. Judah&#x27;s mysticism was in such a stage of opposition; he therefore undervalued the study of the Halakhah and indulged in marked departures from the accepted religious practises. He endeavored to deepen the feeling of devotion and piety and emphasized the importance of studying the Bible rather than studying the Talmud. He deals mystically with prayer, regarding it as more important than study. It was really he who introduced theosophy among the Jews of Germany. The occasional quotations from his &quot;Sefer HaKavod&quot; present the salient points of his views.

The conception of a personal relation to the Lord was long since felt by Jewish thinkers to be inconsistent with His spiritual nature. Judah and his school, therefore, though not the first ones, distinguished between the Divine Being (&quot;Etzem&quot;) and the Divine Majesty (&quot;Kavod&quot;). The Divine Being, called also &quot;Ḳedushshah&quot;, dwells in the west, invisible to men and angels. The Divine Being is superior to all human perception. When God reveals Himself to men and angels, He appears in the form of the Divine Majesty. The Divine Majesty, then, dwelling in the east and created out of divine fire, holds the divine throne, true to its nature of representing to human eyes the Divine Being. The throne is draped on the south, east, and north, while it is open to the west in order to allow the reflection of the Divine Being dwelling in the west to shine upon it. It is surrounded by the heavenly legions of angels, chanting to the glory of the Creator.

Lacking the philosophic training common among the Spanish Jews – although he was acquainted with Ibn Ezra, Saadia, some of the Karaites, and perhaps Maimonides – Judah did not reduce his mystic-theosophical theories to a system, and they are therefore difficult to survey. His intellectual importance is on the whole not clear. Zunz says of him: &quot;To vindicate whatever is noble in human endeavors, and the highest aspirations of the Israelite, and to discover the inmost truths alluded to in the Sacred Books, seemed to be the ultimate purpose of a mind in which poetic, moral, and divine qualities were fused.&quot;

<text>Taieri Mouth is a small fishing village at the mouth of the Taieri River, New Zealand. Taieri Island (Moturata) lies in the ocean several hundred metres off the river&#x27;s mouth.

It has a white sand beach for swimming and several picnic areas. Moturata is a distinctive landmark which can be walked to at low-tide. Caution is advised as the tides can change quickly. Another feature is the millennium walking track that follows the Taieri River from the mouth through the lower gorge to Henley.

The village is located southwest of central Dunedin on the Southern Scenic Route. It is located in the Clutha District on the boundary of Dunedin City and east of Lake Waihola. Immediately to its south is the smaller settlement of Taieri Beach, and the two are often considered parts of the same settlement.

It gained a little notoriety or sadness in the 1990s, relating to the Bain family murders, as the place where Robin Bain worked as the school principal.

==History==
There was a Māori occupation site at Taieri Mouth, with moa bones, indicating it was from the Moa Hunter (early) period of Māori culture.

According to oral tradition in the early 18th century Tuwiriroa moved from Mount Aspiring / Tititea on the Kawarau River near modern Queenstown and built a pā, Motupara, near Taieri Mouth. A rival, Tukiauau, had already built a pā, Whakaraupuka, inland on the Taieri Plain by Lake Waihola. Tuwiriroa had a daughter Haki Te Kura, famous for swimming across Lake Wakatipu. Tukiauau had a handsome son Korokiwhiti. The daughter and son now fell in love but the woman&#x27;s father, the chief of the Taieri Mouth pā, disapproved. The young man&#x27;s father was a hunted man. Hearing his enemies had discovered his whereabouts he decided to abandon the upriver settlement and move his people further south. As they came down the river in their canoes the distraught young woman attempted to jump from a rock into her lover&#x27;s craft but struck the prow and was killed. Adding insult to injury her head was severed and held up angrily to her people on the shore as the flotilla passed by to the sea. There were repercussions and Tukiauau and his son were pursued and eventually killed.
Maori occupation continued and Edward Shortland recorded a small settlement on the site in 1843 and Maori were still living here in 1850. An early European settler was a former whaler, &#x27;The Hermit of Taieri Mouth&#x27; (also known as John Bull) whose real name was John Edward O&#x27;Neil. He is remembered for his boisterous ways and prodigious strength.

On 4 July 2024 the area saw the finding of a deceased intact male blackish-silver specimen of the almost unknown &quot;Mesoplodon traversii&quot; (spade-toothed whale) was washed ashore.

<text>The Arrochar Alps are a group of mountains located around the heads of Loch Long, Loch Fyne, and Loch Goil. They are part of the Grampian mountains range, which stretch across Scotland. The villages of Arrochar and Lochgoilhead are the nearest settlements. Many of the mountains are located on the Cowal Peninsula in Argyll and Bute, west of Scotland.

The mountains are especially popular due to their proximity and accessibility from the central belt of Scotland including Glasgow. They are mostly within both the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park and also in the Argyll Forest Park.

The Glens that give access into the heart of the mountain range include: Glen Croe, Hell&#x27;s Glen, Glen Mhor and Glen Kinglas.

The A83, a main trunk road to the west coast of Scotland passes through the area. There is a train station nearby at Arrochar and Tarbet railway station.

<text>Mottville is a hamlet in the Town of Skaneateles, New York, United States. A tornado touched down in Mottville on July 28, 2002.

== History ==

Mottville, originally styled &quot;Mottsville&quot;, was named after Arthur Mott, who moved to the area about 1820, owned a wool factory, and was for some time a successful and prominent citizen. He died of the effects of alcoholism in Toledo, Ohio, on October 30, 1869. The Friends Female Boarding School was established on the west shore of Skaneateles Lake by Lydia P. Mott, mother of Arthur Mott, soon after her arrival in about 1818.

In 1836 Mottville contained about 30 homes, a post-office, one furnace, a grist and saw mill, and a tavern. Skaneateles Falls also developed into a busy center with a post-office. Other hamlets in the vicinity were Kellogg&#x27;s Mills, Willow Glen, and Glenside.

A local newspaper, the &quot;Communitist&quot; [sic], was launched in early 1844, issued fortnightly by the Skaneateles Community, at Community Place, near Mottville, promoted by the Vermont-born abolitionist and communalist John A. Collins.

<text>Revived Communist Party of Georgia (, SAKP) was a communist party in Georgia. Founded in 1997. The party is now dissolved.

The party had a 105-member central committee elected on a two-year mandate. A CC Bureau was constituted with 21 members. The party claimed to have 17,500 members divided in 32 regional organizations. It published &quot;Tskhovreba&quot;.

The chairman of the party was Shalva Berianidze. The second secretary was Zakaria Menteshashvili.

Initially the party was part of the electoral bloc &quot;Revived Communists and People&#x27;s Patriots&quot; together with the Democratic Union of Georgia. It then shifted, ahead of the 1999 elections and joined the bloc &quot;Communists - Stalinists&quot; which had been formed by Communist Party of Georgia and Political Party &quot;Stalineli&quot;.

The party advocated a foreign policy of active neutrality. The party was opposed to separatism.

It was recognized as the legal inheritor of the Communist Party of Georgia.</text><links>

<doc id="1093519" wikidata="Q244611" url="?curid=1093519" title="Onion ring">
<text>Onion rings (also called French-fried onion rings) is a form of British and American cuisine. They generally consist of a cross-sectional &quot;ring&quot; of onion dipped in batter or bread crumbs and then deep fried; a variant is made with onion paste. While typically served as a side dish, onion rings are often eaten by themselves.

Onion strings are a variant where the onion is cut vertically first, resulting in strips rather than circles.

==History==

The earliest recipe for onion rings dates back to 1802, when British food writer John Mollard published &quot;The Art of Cookery Made Easy and Refined&quot;. It called for cutting onions into slices, dipping them into a batter including Parmesan cheese, and deep-frying them in lard. The recipe also suggested serving them with a sauce of melted butter and mustard.

Many recipes for deep-fried onion slices or rings are found starting in the early 20th century. There are various processes: 
* no coating: 1902, 1907;
* dipped in milk or egg and coated in flour: 1902, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1916; 
* battered: 1919, 1922;
* breaded: 1914.
==Food chemistry==

The cooking process decomposes propanethial oxide in the onion into the sweet-smelling and tasting in bispropenyl disulfide, responsible for the slightly sweet taste of onion rings.

<doc id="1093523" wikidata="Q1894079" url="?curid=1093523" title="Paraíba Valley">
<text>The Paraíba Valley () is a landform that encompasses the regions: Paraíba Valley Metropolitan Region and Northern Coast, in the state of São Paulo and Sul-Fluminense Region, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which stands out for concentrating a considerable portion of the Brazilian economy.

The name is due to the fact that the region is part of the Paraíba do Sul river basin, since this river extends from the São Paulo and along almost the entire length of the state of Rio de Janeiro and a small southern part of the Minas Gerais state.

In the strict sense, the name &quot;Vale do Paraíba&quot;, &quot;Paraíba Valley&quot; in English, should only be used to refer to a region with a certain geographical feature. Therefore, this is not an official IBGE Region, Mesoregion or Microregion.

== Location ==
It is located on the banks of the Presidente Dutra highway (BR-116), exactly between the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, within the metropolitan complex formed by the two capitals and with its main urban axis following the Via Dutra route. Although highly urbanized and industrialized, the region also has important nature reserves, such as the Serra da Mantiqueira, on the border with Minas Gerais, one of the highest points in Brazil, and that of Bocaina, an Atlantic Forest stronghold that also includes small towns and farms of historical and architectural interest.

=== Municipalities of the region ===

The total population of all municipalities in the region is almost 3.3 million, equivalent to the population of the Uruguay.

The most important cities in the region are:

* On Rio&#x27;s Side: Volta Redonda, Resende, Barra Mansa and Barra do Piraí;
* On São Paulo&#x27;s Side: São José dos Campos, Taubaté, Jacareí, Caçapava, Pindamonhangaba, Guaratinguetá, Lorena, Caraguatatuba and Cruzeiro. Beside those cities, Aparecida and Cachoeira Paulista, have great national prominence due to religious tourism.

Other cities in the region are:

* Rio&#x27;s Side: Itatiaia, Pinheiral, Piraí, Quatis, Rio Claro, Valença, Rio das Flores, Porto Real e Paraty.
* São Paulo&#x27;s Side: Arapeí, Areias, Bananal, Campos do Jordão, Canas, Cunha, Igaratá, Ilhabela, Jambeiro, Lagoinha, Lavrinhas, Monteiro Lobato, Natividade da Serra, Paraibuna, Piquete, Potim, Queluz, Redenção da Serra, Roseira, Santa Branca, São José do Barreiro, São Luiz do Paraitinga, São Sebastião, Silveiras, Tremembé e Ubatuba.

== Demography ==
The history of the Paraíba Valley is closely linked to the coffee cycle, a period of opulence that gave the region prestige and political power. Despite the city of Lorena that began its development with the gold cycle in the 1700s due to the passage through the Paraíba do Sul River.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a group of Trappist religious settled in the Maristela farm in Tremembé, and introduced rice cultivation in the Paraíba do Sul river floodplains, as well as new planting and irrigation techniques.

Milk production was introduced with the decay of coffee, which occurred after the world economic crisis of 1929.

The industrialization of the Paraíba Valley began in the 1940s during the Estado Novo, a set of new politics implemented at the time, following a diplomatic agreement made between Brazil and the United States, which envisaged an ambitious project: the construction of a steel mill that would supply the demand for steel from the Allied Countries during the Second World War and aid in the development of Brazil. In 1946, one of the largest steel complexes in the world and the largest in Latin America was inaugurated, Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional – CSN, located in Volta Redonda. The start of steel production at CSN served as the basis for the industrialization of the country and, especially, of Paraíba Valley, with the arrival of steel companies in the region, as well as the automotive and aerospace industry.

=== Economy ===

==== Agriculture and Livestock ====

Farming is still vital to several municipalities in this region, being the main source of revenue and taxes in some cities.

Vale do Paraíba is the second largest milk producer in the country. For reasons, milk production is in decline, but still sustains a large part of the rural population of small municipalities.

Rice is one of the most important agricultural products of the region reaching in the 2002/2003 harvest, the mark of 850 thousand bags of 60 kg.

Other diversified crops are being tried by some producers in these floodplains.

The current land structure of the Paraíba Valley is the result of significant changes in the form of land distribution that occurred after coffee decay, when large farms began to be shredded in family shares and inheritances. This process multiplied as the generations went on, resulting in a region punctuated by small properties and markedly familiar agricultural production.

==== Industry ====
In the 1950s, the region rapidly industrialized. At this time, in São Paulo, the creation of the Aeronautical Technological Institute, the consequent installation of the aeronautical industry with Embraer, the largest aerospace complex in Latin America, as well as the automakers Volkswagen, Ford, GM, Chery, LG and Ericsson, as well as Alstom and Usiminas, among others. In Rio de Janeiro, CSN attracted other mining and steel companies. Other industrial complexes include Coca-Cola, Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover, PSA Peugeot Citroën, MAN Trucks and Buses and Hyundai Heavy Industries, as well as Guardian do Brasil, ArcelorMittal Siderurgica Barra Mansa, Brazil&#x27;s Nuclear Industries (INB), Michelin, White Martins, the National Rolled Steel Industry (INAL), the Brazilian Stannifer Company (CESBRA), S / A Tubonal, Saint-Gobain Channeling, among others.

=== Education ===

<text>The Strath Taieri (sometimes spelt Strath-Taieri) is a large glacial valley and river plateau in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is surrounded by the rugged hill ranges to the north and west of Otago Harbour. Since 1989 it has been part of the city of Dunedin. The small town of Middlemarch is located at its southern end.

The name is a hybrid word, from &quot;Strath&quot; (anglicised Irish and Scots Gaelic &quot;srath&quot;), meaning a broad river valley, and the Māori name &quot;Taieri&quot; (alternative spelling Taiari) of the river which runs through it.

==History==
===Early history===
There is evidence that moa hunters (1300–1500) were once active on the Strath Taieri, the Taieri Gorge, at Deep Stream and Rocklands on the adjacent plateau to the south. A Māori route from the coast to the interior lay along the valley. Activity during the Classic period (1500–1642) is attested by a cave discovered in 1949 with its entrance blocked, containing the bodies of a Māori woman and child. It is not clear if they were trapped deliberately or accidentally. This corresponds with other sites in the area containing rock shelters with mostly domestic articles, wooden bowls, material for garments and gear for hunting weka or fishing. Charles Kettle saw the area from the top of Maungatua in 1847 and was impressed by the land&#x27;s pastoral potential.

Strath Taieri and its surrounding district lay beyond the limit of the coastal Otago Block which Kettle was surveying but, following the Otago Association&#x27;s settlement on that land in 1848, horizons became broader. Kettle was one of the first Europeans known to have visited the Strath Taieri when he led an exploration party up the &quot;strath&quot; in February 1851. The Otago Provincial government was established in 1852, whose territory included the region.

It seems Duncan Stewart, his wife and their children were living on the site of what was later the Barewood homestead, on the Barewood run, by late 1853 or early 1854. John Sutton was granted the Barewood Run in 1854 before it was surveyed. Between 1857 and 1859 much of the land in and around Strath Taieri was taken up by pastoralists on lease from the Crown.

One of these leaseholds, Cottesbrook, became the centre of several sheep stations put together by the Tasmanian Gellibrand family. A group of buildings, including a homestead, office, cottage, cook house, butcher&#x27;s shop and large shearing shed were all built from the local stone. They remain, fine examples of masonry and distinctively Australasian design. A number of the early European settlers came from Tasmania.

===The gold rush and its aftermath===
From 1861, the Otago gold rushes saw the development of a stagecoach route, the Dunstan Trail leaving the coastal Taieri Plain near Outram advancing north and west across the plateau south of Strath Taieri proper, through Clark&#x27;s Junction and on over the Rock and Pillar Range to the Maniototo. A new road north through Strath Taieri was proposed in 1863. In 1864, gold-bearing ground was reported at Hyde at the head of Strath Taieri and now the northern limit of Dunedin. Briefly, there were two thousand people there. Goldfields to the east and north saw the &#x27;middle Taieri valley&#x27;, as Strath Taieri was sometimes called, surrounded by prospering districts.

Edward Wingfield Humphreys (1841–1892) is credited with naming the valley &#x27;Strath Taieri&#x27;. Alice Humphreys (née Hawdon, 1848–1934) moved to her husband&#x27;s property in the &quot;strath&quot; soon after their marriage in 1869. She is credited with calling the private township laid out on their property &#x27;Middlemarch&#x27; after George Eliot&#x27;s novel. However, this origin of the name has been disputed. From whatever source it got its name, the private township of Middlemarch on Humphrey&#x27;s property of Garthmyl had been surveyed on land adjoining the projected railway and several sections were already sold by 6 November 1880. A stone house was built and occupied by Mr. Kirk and his family by the winter of 1881. By 1891, there was a hotel, eight houses, two blacksmith shops, two stores, a school and twenty tents occupied by workers building the railway.

Following the abolition of the New Zealand provinces in 1876 the Taieri County was formed, whose Deep Stream Riding included Strath Taieri. The county improved the road traversing the plateau from the Taieri Plain, building a bridge over Deep Stream in 1880, a suspension bridge over the Taieri River at Sutton in 1885, and the same year another over the Taieri linking Middlemarch with the Cottesbrook station. The Sutton Stream, south of the township, was bridged in 1884. There was a long pause before the &#x27;centre road&#x27;, now state highway 87, was extended north to Hyde and the Maniototo.

Construction of the Otago Central Railway from the South Island&#x27;s main trunk line, which lay along the coast, began in 1879. Its route was projected to cross the Taieri Plain and follow the Taieri Gorge upstream to Strath Taieri, which it would then traverse from south to north as the main route to Central Otago. The gorge presented formidable obstacles, to which the existing bridges and tunnels are now picturesque testimony. The line reached Middlemarch in April 1891, spurring the township&#x27;s development. It was extended to Hyde on 16 July 1894, where it had a similar effect. The line&#x27;s eventual terminus was Cromwell in the Upper Clutha catchment, but it did not arrive there until 1921.
To develop Middlemarch the March Creek had been diverted and for many years the township was regularly flooded until channel work on the creek ameliorated the problem. A Presbyterian preacher covered the Strath Taieri district in 1886. Anglican and Roman Catholic churches were built in 1901 and a handsome church of the local schist stone was completed for the Presbyterians in 1906.

===Twentieth century and beyond===
Gold mining in nearby areas such as Macraes Flat and Nenthorn buoyed up the development of the Strath Taieri and its townships, but that stalled in the twentieth century. In the 1880s, rabbits became a plague, and it was only by strenuous efforts this was contained by the 1940s. Runs were broken up for closer settlement in 1894 and later, but the valley remained thinly populated. In 1914, there was a move to have the Strath Taieri Riding transferred to the Maniototo County, which was unsuccessful. In the 1930s, attempts to get a water supply for Middlemarch were also unsuccessful. However, an electricity supply to Middlemarch was made operative on 28 July 1939.

On 4 June 1943, the derailment of the Dunedin Cromwell Express on the outskirts of Hyde cost twenty-one lives. Because the accident was attributed to the negligence of the engine driver, the government became liable for more than £200,000 in compensation. The modern equivalent would be several million dollars. Postwar development was slow and while farm production increased, the population expanded only a little and latterly declined.

As the 20th century advanced, this large and apparently empty country maintained the character and atmosphere of a pioneering district. Middlemarch could seem to visitors like a set for &#x27;High Noon&#x27;. The plateau country to the south, with its fantastic rock formations, tors, heightens the impression of antiquity and otherworldliness which inspired artistic responses. Until 1948, Antimony was mined at Hindon.

The celebrated New Zealand painter Colin McCahon as a schoolboy in 1936, had what he later described as a &#x27;vision&#x27; looking westward from a point on the coastal hills over the Taieri Plain apparently to the plateau country south of the Strath Taieri proper. He later said his art had been an attempt to communicate this vision. He described it as seeing a landscape &#x27;standing far from the sun of Egypt in the Otago cold.&#x27; He called it a &#x27;landscape of splendour and order and peace&#x27;, which he conceived as a pre-Biblical place. In 1945, his younger and also celebrated Otago contemporary, the poet James K. Baxter, wrote &#x27;Upon the upland road/Ride easy, stranger:/Surrender to the sky/Your heart of anger.&#x27; The lines certainly capture the effect on some people of the experience of crossing the plateau, approaching the Strath Taieri by road from the south.

That landscape became greener in the 1960s and 1970s as native tussock was converted to European pasture, a process protested in the works of the artist Marilynn Webb. But the postwar prosperity of farming ended in the 1970s. In October 1977, the Taieri County was merged with its northern neighbour, Waikouaiti County, thus Strath Taieri became part of the new The Silverpeaks County surrounding Dunedin and its boroughs in an inland arc. Rural recession intensified and in 1989 The Silverpeaks County was merged into a new, much enlarged, City of Dunedin. In 1990, the Central Otago Railway was closed and the line from Clyde back to Middlemarch soon uplifted. Nevertheless, a tourist train service was being operated from Dunedin to Strath Taieri by way of the Taieri Gorge on the remaining part of the line. Since 1991 this has been run by the Taieri Gorge Railway Limited owned by the Dunedin City Council. In 1993, the course of the track further inland was opened as the Otago Central Rail Trail for hikers and cyclists, by the Department of Conservation. Both have proved successful in attracting visitors.
As a farming district, strategically located but isolated by geographical barriers, Strath Taieri&#x27;s development turned on changes in farming and transport until the late 20th century. While the closure of the through railway saw the end of that means of moving heavy goods between the coast and the interior, the completion of the tar sealing of State Highway 87, in 1996, was the effective provision of another. With the growth of tourism, much of it motor-vehicle-based, this, with the rail trail and tourist rail services, has added a new element to the mix.

The rural, pioneering atmosphere of the district was perhaps responsible for the unexpected success of its bachelor dances, recently promoted ostensibly to find partners for its single men. That, and the emergence of New Zealand&#x27;s iconic Southern Man may have led to the event&#x27;s attracting visitors from around the country and overseas. Apparently, few marriages have resulted, but Strath Taieri has become known to many more people.

==Demographics==
The statistical area of Strath Taieri, which includes Middlemarch, covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Strath Taieri had a population of 666 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 48 people (−6.7%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 48 people (−6.7%) since the 2006 census. There were 267 households, comprising 369 males and 300 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.23 males per female. The median age was 43.0 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 135 people (20.3%) aged under 15 years, 84 (12.6%) aged 15 to 29, 366 (55.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 84 (12.6%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 95.5% European/Pākehā, 9.9% Māori, 0.5% Pasifika, and 1.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 6.8, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 56.3% had no religion, and 36.5% were Christian.

Of those at least 15 years old, 84 (15.8%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 90 (16.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $34,700, compared with $31,800 nationally. 69 people (13.0%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 297 (55.9%) people were employed full-time, 93 (17.5%) were part-time, and 18 (3.4%) were unemployed.

== Education ==
In 2021, there is one primary school in the Strath Taieri District, at Middlemarch. There were several schools in earlier times.

<text>Mitchell Jay Feigenbaum (December 19, 1944 – June 30, 2019) was an American mathematical physicist whose pioneering studies in chaos theory led to the discovery of the Feigenbaum constants.

== Early life ==
Feigenbaum was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jewish emigrants from Poland and Ukraine. He attended Samuel J. Tilden High School, in Brooklyn, New York, and the City College of New York. In 1964, he began his graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Enrolling for graduate study in electrical engineering, he changed his area of study to physics. He completed his doctorate in 1970 for a thesis on dispersion relations, under the supervision of Professor Francis E. Low.

== Career ==
After short positions at Cornell University (1970–1972) and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (1972–1974), he was offered a longer-term post at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to study turbulence in fluids. He was at Cornell from 1982 to 1986 and then joined Rockefeller University as Toyota Professor in 1987. Although a complete theory of turbulent fluids remains elusive, Feigenbaum&#x27;s research paved the way for chaos theory, providing groundbreaking insight into the many dynamical systems in which scientists and mathematicians find chaotic maps.

In 1983, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, and in 1986, alongside Rockefeller University colleague Albert Libchaber, he was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics &quot;for his pioneering theoretical studies demonstrating the universal character of non-linear systems, which has made possible the systematic study of chaos&quot;. He was a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at the Scripps Research Institute. He remained at Rockefeller University as Toyota Professor from 1987 until his death.
== Work ==
Some mathematical mappings involving a single linear parameter exhibit the apparently random behavior known as chaos when the parameter lies within certain ranges. As the parameter is increased towards this region, the mapping undergoes bifurcations at precise values of the parameter. At first, one stable point occurs, then bifurcates to an oscillation between two values, then bifurcating again to oscillate between four values, and so on. Feigenbaum discovered in 1975, using an HP-65 calculator, that the ratio of the difference between the values at which such successive period-doubling bifurcations occur tends to a constant of around 4.6692... He was able to provide a mathematical argument of that fact, and he then showed that the same behavior, with the same mathematical constant, would occur within a wide class of mathematical functions, prior to the onset of chaos. This universal result enabled mathematicians to take their first steps to unraveling the apparently intractable &quot;random&quot; behavior of chaotic systems. The &quot;ratio of convergence&quot; measured in this study is now known as the first Feigenbaum constant.

The logistic map is a prominent example of the mappings that Feigenbaum studied in his noted 1978 article: &quot;Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations&quot;.

Feigenbaum&#x27;s other contributions include the development of important new fractal methods in cartography, starting when he was hired by Hammond to develop techniques to allow computers to assist in drawing maps. The introduction to the &quot;Hammond Atlas&quot; (1992) states:
Using fractal geometry to describe natural forms such as coastlines, mathematical physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum developed software capable of reconfiguring coastlines, borders, and mountain ranges to fit a multitude of map scales and projections. Dr. Feigenbaum also created a new computerized type-placement program which places thousands of map labels in minutes, a task that previously required days of tedious labor.


In another practical application of his work, he founded Numerix with Michael Goodkin in 1996. The company&#x27;s initial product was a software algorithm that dramatically reduced the time required for Monte Carlo pricing of exotic financial derivatives and structured products.

The press release made on the occasion of his receiving the Wolf Prize summed up his works:
The impact of Feigenbaum&#x27;s discoveries has been phenomenal. It has spanned new fields of theoretical and experimental mathematics ... It is hard to think of any other development in recent theoretical science that has had so broad an impact over so wide a range of fields, spanning both the very pure and the very applied.

<doc id="1093558" wikidata="Q3273322" url="?curid=1093558" title="Surakiart Sathirathai">
<text>Surakiart Sathirathai (; ; born June 7, 1958, Bangkok) is a Thai politician who, until September 19, 2006, a Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand overseeing Foreign Affairs, Education and Culture. He is former President of the Asian Society of International Law and former President of the Asian Peace and Reconciliation Council.

==Family and early career==
Surakiart grew up in Bangkok. His father was Sunthorn Sathirathai, former Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Thai Ministry of Finance, and his mother was Kuakoon Sawat-chuto Sathirathai, Professor in French literature at Chulalongkorn University. Surakiart graduated with a First Class (valedictorian) degree in law from Bangkok&#x27;s Chulalongkorn University. He earned two master&#x27;s degrees: one in law (LL.M.) from Harvard Law School with a thesis on human rights, and another in law and diplomacy from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University. Surakiart was the first Thai to earn a doctorate in law from Harvard Law School. His doctoral thesis, &quot;An Understanding of the Relationship Among International Legal Discourse About Development, Third World Countries, and International Peace,&quot; (1985) explored the global trade law regime from the perspective of the third world. He later co-edited &quot;Third World Attitudes Toward International Law: An Introduction&quot; (1987) and authored various articles on law and development including &quot;Peace and Security: The Challenge and the Promise&quot;, 41 Texas International Law Journal 513 (2006). From the late 1980s until the late 1990s, Surakiart taught in the Faculty of Law at Chulalongkorn University and ultimately became Dean.

==Career in Thai politics==
In 1995, Dr. Surakiart became Thailand&#x27;s youngest Finance Minister under Prime Minister Banharn Silapa-Archa. Surakiart&#x27;s supporters maintain that although he inherited a national economy beset by structural challenges that ultimately exposed it to the Thai financial crisis, Dr. Surakiart designed and implemented reforms that, while deeply unpopular, moved the economy in the right direction and have become an essential part of Thailand&#x27;s economic policy. Nevertheless, he resigned less than a year after his appointment over his handling of the collapse of the Bangkok Bank of Commerce.

After his tenure at the Finance Ministry, Surakiart went on to serve as Vice-Chairman of the Advisory Council on Economic and Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh until 1997. Following that, he was President of the Institute of Social and Economic Policy (ISEP), a think tank, from 1997 to 2001. In the late 1990s, Surakiart led several major Thai corporations through restructurings and bankruptcy proceedings and founded and chaired a major Bangkok law firm.

In 2001, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra appointed Dr. Surakiart as Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position he held until early 2005 when he became Deputy Prime Minister. As Foreign Minister, Surakiart sought to promote regional economic development through various cooperative networks, including Ayeyarwaddy-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) and the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD). On 8 March 2001, Surakiart make a two-day official visit to Malaysia to enhance relations between the two countries. As Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Minister of Culture, Surakiart now oversees the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Education, and Culture.

On 2 October 2006, he became an independent politician by resigning from his last political party Thai Rak Thai following the coupe d&#x27;tat of Thailand. His intention in this political exodus is still unknown but the military junta of Thailand has announced to continue supporting his bid for UN top job.

==Campaign to become UN Secretary General==
The Royal Thai Government had nominated Surakiart as Thailand&#x27;s candidate for United Nations Secretary-General. Many other nations, including the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had pledged to support Surakiart&#x27;s bid. He was also rumored to have the backing of China, a permanent member of the Security Council. Surakiart&#x27;s candidature may have been adversely affected by the controversial policies of Thaksin Shinawatra, whose relations with the military junta in Myanmar and handling of unrest in the predominantly Muslim south of the country were particularly contentious. Notably, the Asian Human Rights Commission campaigned against Surakiart on account of Thailand&#x27;s policy toward Myanmar. However, Surakiart&#x27;s supporters contended that he spearheaded Thailand&#x27;s &quot;prosper thy neighbor&quot; policy of regional economic coordination and that his quiet diplomatic style had helped resolve numerous long-standing regional disputes.

The Secretary General is appointed by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Security Council. To be elected, a candidate to the post needs 9 votes from the Security Council, including those of all 5 permanent members. The General Assembly then holds a vote; two-thirds of Member States need to support the candidacy for the Secretary General to be appointed.

===Straw poll results===
In July 2006 a straw poll was held among the UNSG candidates and Dr. Surakiat placed third, behind Ban Ki-moon from South Korea and Shashi Tharoor from India. Surakiart scored 7 encouragements, 3 discouragements, and 5 no opinions. Ban scored 12-1-2 and Tharoor scored 10-2-3.

In a second September 14 straw poll, Surakiart gained some ground, scoring 9 encouragements, 3 discouragements, and 3 no opinions. However, he still scored third behind Ban and Tharoor. Ban scored 14-1-0 and Tharoor scored 10-3-2.

In a straw poll held on September 28, however, Surakiart fell into fourth place, winning only 5 encouragements, 7 discouragements and 3 no opinions. The entry of additional candidates, including former Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga, into the race, combined with the military coup that took place only weeks before the poll, were likely causes of Surakiart&#x27;s loss of support.

South Korea&#x27;s foreign minister, Ban Ki-moon, won the support of the Security Council&#x27;s five permanent members in an informal vote on the next UN secretary-general held on 3 October 2006, and was subsequently elected Secretary-General.

===Jayanama Family&#x27;s Opposition to Campaign===
Opposition to Surakiart has been especially vocal among the Jayanama family of Thai diplomats. In a mass rally in front of thousands of anti-Thaksin protesters, former ambassador to the UN Asda Jayanama noted &quot;Because we have a weak foreign minister who responded to Thaksin as if he were his servant, we have been unable to solve any problems&quot;.. Asda also claimed that Surakiart Sathirathai parked his car outside the official residence of UN secretary-general at night so he could see it. &quot;It&#x27;s very embarrassing,&quot; Asda told the crowd. The former diplomat blasted Surkiart&#x27;s candidacy as a lost cause and an embarrassment for Thailand&#x27;s international standing, claiming that it was &quot;silly&quot; to believe that handshakes from 127 countries amounted to formal endorsements. He has also publicly called Surakiart &quot;a third rate politician&quot;, &quot;clumsy&quot;, &quot;bungling&quot;, and &quot;lacking a brand name&quot;..

Surakiart responded by accusing Asda of defaming him and threatened to file a defamation suit if he didn&#x27;t stop attacking him in public. .

While Foreign Minister, Surakiart transferred Asda&#x27;s younger brother Surapong Jayanama to become ambassador to Germany (from Director General of the East Asia Department of the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs). He also transferred Asda&#x27;s younger brother Apipong Jayanama to become head of the Institute of Foreign Affairs (from Director General of the Department of American and South Pacific Affairs). Some have speculated that Asda&#x27;s opposition to Surakiart might stem from these events .

==Personal life==
He is married to Thanpuying Dr. Suthawan Sathirathai, a niece to the Queen of Thailand, who holds several advanced degrees including a doctorate in Land Economy from the University of Cambridge (UK). They have one son, Dr. Santitarn Sathirathai, who graduated from Harvard University. In keeping with Thai tradition, Dr. Surakiart Sathirathai spent a period as a monk in a Buddhist monastery.

<doc id="1093568" wikidata="Q6991742" url="?curid=1093568" title="Neo-Mandaic">
<text>Neo-Mandaic, also known as Modern Mandaic, sometimes called the &quot;ratna&quot; ( &quot;jargon&quot;), is the modern reflex of the Mandaic language, the liturgical language of the Mandaean religious community of Iraq and Iran. Although severely endangered, it survives as the first language of a small number of Mandaeans (possibly as few as 100–200 speakers) in Iran and in the Mandaean diaspora. All Neo-Mandaic speakers are multilingual in the languages of their neighbors, Arabic and Persian, and the influence of these languages upon the grammar of Neo-Mandaic is considerable, particularly in the lexicon and the morphology of the noun. Nevertheless, Neo-Mandaic is more conservative even in these regards than most other Neo-Aramaic languages.

==General information==
Neo-Mandaic (ISO 639-3: mid) represents the latest stage of the development of Classical Mandaic, a language of the Middle East which was first attested during the period of Late Antiquity and which continues to be used to the present date by the Mandaean religious community of Iraq and Iran. While the members of this community, numbered at roughly 70,000 or fewer adherents throughout the world, are familiar with the classical dialect through their sacred literature and liturgy, only a few hundred Mandaeans, located primarily in Iran, speak Neo-Mandaic (known to them as the &quot;raṭnɔ&quot;) as a first language. Two surviving dialects of Neo-Mandaic have thus far been documented, those of Ahwāz (in Macuch 1965a, Macuch 1965b, Macuch 1989, and Macuch 1993) and Khorramshahr (in Häberl 2009). These dialects are mutually intelligible to the extent that speakers of either dialect will deny that there are any differences between the two.

===Genetic affiliation===
Neo-Mandaic is a dialect of Aramaic, a Northwest Semitic language that was formerly spoken throughout the Middle East. Already in antiquity, a split had developed between the Western dialects of Aramaic (spoken in primarily in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel), and the Eastern dialects (spoken primarily in Mesopotamia and Iran) to which Neo-Mandaic pertains. 

The bulk of scholarship on these modern reflexes of these dialects, collectively described as Neo-Aramaic, has focused primarily on Eastern Aramaic languages, particularly the Central Neo-Aramaic (Turoyo and Mlahsô) and Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) dialects spoken by Jewish and Christian communities in north-east Syria, northern Iraq, and north-west Iran.

A smaller but still considerable volume of scholarship is dedicated to the more peripheral dialects such as the Western Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken by Christians and Muslims in three villages near Damascus, and Neo-Mandaic. Of all the dialects that have thus far been documented, only Neo-Mandaic can be described with any certainty as the modern reflex of any classical written form of Aramaic.

===History of scholarship===
The first attempt at documenting Neo-Mandaic, a polyglot glossary including a column of lexical items from the Neo-Mandaic dialect of Basra, was produced roughly 350 years ago by a Carmelite missionary whom Borghero has identified with the Discalced Carmelite . This Glossarium was to have a perennial influence upon subsequent generations of Mandaeologists; it was consulted by Theodor Nöldeke and Rudolf Macúch in the preparation of their grammars, and the contents of its Neo-Mandaic column were incorporated into Drower and Macuch&#x27;s 1963 dictionary. No complete Neo-Mandaic text was published until the beginning of the twentieth century, when de Morgan published five documents collected in Iran (transliterated and translated by Macuch). The last few decades have seen a marked increase in the number of Neo-Mandaic texts available to scholarship (Macuch 1965b, 1989, and 1993) and a descriptive grammar (Häberl 2009).

===Writing system===
Neo-Mandaic is generally unwritten. On the rare occasions on which it is written, in personal letters and in the colophons that are attached to manuscripts, it is rendered using a modified version of the classical script. With the exception of , all vowels are represented, but without any indication of length or quality. The letter ʕ consistently represents an epenthetic vowel, either or . Additionally, the Arabic letter has been borrowed to indicate the voiced pharyngeal fricative as well as the glottal stop. The letters &quot;b&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;t&quot; may represent stops ( and ) or fricatives ( and ). Formerly the fricatives were not distinctive segments but merely allophones of the stops after a vowel; the sound rule governing this alternation is now defunct. Neo-Mandaic orthography differs from that of Classical Mandaic by using &quot;u&quot; to represent even when it is a reflex of Classical Mandaic &quot;b&quot;. As Neo-Mandaic contains several phonemes not found in Classical Mandaic, several letters from the original script have been modified with two dots placed below to represent these phonemes: &quot;š&quot; may represent , &quot;d&quot; represents , and &quot;h&quot; represents . Private Mandaic schools in Iran and Australia employ a version of this same script with a few further pedagogic modifications.

==Phonology==
There are 35 distinctive segments in Neo-Mandaic: 28 consonants and seven vowels. For most of these segments, there is a relatively wide degree of allophonic variation. The transcription system, which is phonemic, does not reflect this variation; nor does it reflect sporadic assimilations, deletions, and other features that are typical of allegro speech.

===Consonants===
Neo-Mandaic has 28 distinctive consonantal segments, including four loan-phonemes: the postalveolar affricates &quot;č&quot; and &quot;j&quot; and the pharyngeal fricatives &quot;&quot; and &quot;ḥ&quot; , which are found only in vocabulary of foreign origin, particularly Arabic and Persian. Two pharyngealized segments (a voiced alveolar stop &quot;ḍ&quot; and a voiced alveolar fricative &quot;ẓ&quot; ) are found in a few Arabic loan words. They have been excluded from the phonemic inventory of Neo-Mandaic due to their marginal status.

Voiceless stops are lightly aspirated.

===Vowels===

The vowel system in Neo-Mandaic is composed of seven distinct vowels, of which six (&quot;i&quot; , &quot;u&quot; , &quot;e&quot; , &quot;o&quot; , &quot;a&quot; , and &quot;ɔ&quot; ) are principal phonemes, and one (&quot;ə&quot; ) is marginal. The vowels are distinguished by quality rather than quantity. Three of the principal vowels, the &quot;tense&quot; vowels &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;ɔ&quot;, are lengthened in open accented syllables to , , and or . and are realized as and whenever they occur in closed syllables, either accented or unaccented (exceptions are Persian loanwords (e.g. &quot;gush&quot; &quot;ear&quot;) and contextual forms such as &quot;asut&quot;, from &quot;asuta&quot; &quot;health&quot;). The other three principle vowels, the &quot;lax&quot; vowels &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;a&quot;, appear only exceptionally in open accented syllables. is realized as in open syllables and in closed syllables. is realized as in open syllables and as in closed syllables. is realized as in closed accented syllables, and as or elsewhere. Schwa has the widest allophonic variation of all the vowels. It is regularly fronted, backed, raised, or lowered in harmony with the vowel of the following syllable. When it is followed by , it is regularly raised and backed to . When the accent falls on a closed syllable containing schwa, it becomes fronted and raised to .

There are also five diphthongs, &quot;ey&quot; , &quot;ay&quot; , &quot;aw&quot; , &quot;ɔy&quot; , and &quot;ɔw&quot; . The diphthongs and , which had already collapsed in closed accented syllables to and in the classical language, have collapsed in all accented syllables in the dialects of Ahwāz and Khorramshahr, apart from those in words of foreign origin. The collapse of diphthongs appears to be further advanced in the dialect of Ahvāz; compare Khorramshahr &quot;gɔw&quot; &#x27;in&#x27; with Ahwāz &quot;gu&quot; id. Closely tied to the collapse of the diphthong in open accented syllables is the breaking of its outcome, to in the same environment. For example, classical baita &#x27;house&#x27; has become &quot;bieṯɔ&quot; in Neo-Mandaic. This sound change is today typical of both the contemporary dialects of Ahwāz and Khorramshahr, but is not present in the unpublished texts from Iraq collected by Drower or in Macuch 1989.

===Syllable structure===
Neo-Mandaic words range in size from one to five syllables. Each syllable consists of an onset (which is optional in word-initial syllables) and a rime. The rime consists of a nucleus (usually a vowel or a syllabic consonant) with or without a coda. The onset and the coda which frame the nucleus consist of consonants; the onset is mandatory for all word-internal syllables, but the coda is optional in all environments. Whenever an enclitic pronominal suffix (see 3.3. below) lacking an onset is added to a closed accented syllable, the coda of the syllable is geminated to form the onset of the following syllable. Whenever the voiceless interdental fricative /θ/ is geminated in this environment, its outcome is the cluster [χt] rather than the expected [θθ]. For example, when the pronominal suffixes are appended directly to the existential particle *&quot;eṯ&quot; [ɛθ] (Classical ‘it), it regularly takes the form &quot;ext-&quot; [ɛχt]. This rule affects the conjugation of the verb &quot;meṯ&quot; ~ &quot;moṯ&quot; (&quot;mɔyeṯ&quot;) ‘to die,’ e.g. &quot;meṯ&quot; ‘he died’ but &quot;mextat&quot; ‘she died.’ It is also responsible for the modern form of the abstract ending &quot;uxtɔ&quot; (Classical -uta).

The syllable patterns V (&quot;ɔ&quot; [ɔ] ‘this’), VC (&quot;ax&quot; [ɑχ] ‘that’), CV (&quot;mu&quot; [mu] ‘what’), and CVC (&quot;tum&quot; [tum] ‘then’) are the most common. Slightly less common are syllables containing clusters of consonantal or vocalic segments, such as VCC (&quot;ahl&quot; [ahl] ‘family’), CCV (&quot;klɔṯɔ&quot; [ˈklɔː.θɔ] ‘three’), CCVC (&quot;ṣṭɔnye&quot; [ˈstɔn.je] ‘he is a boy’), CVCC (&quot;waxt&quot; [væχt] ‘time’), CVVC (&quot;bieṯ&quot; [biɛ̆θ] ‘house’), and even CVVCC (&quot;šieltxon&quot; [ˈʃiɛ̆lt.χon] ‘I asked you (pl.)’). Permissible consonant clusters in Neo-Mandaic fall into two categories: clusters that form at the beginning or the end of a syllable, and those that span syllable boundaries. The former are strictly limited to certain combination of segments. The latter are less restricted; with few exceptions, Neo-Mandaic tolerates most clusters of two or occasionally even three consonants across a syllable boundary. Consonant clusters consisting of a stop followed by a sonorant, a sibilant followed by a sonorant, or a sibilant followed by a stop, are tolerated in both syllable-final and syllable-initial environments. Consonant clusters consisting of a sonorant and a stop or a sonorant and a fricative are tolerated in word final environment alone. /ə/ is regularly inserted as an anaptyctic vowel to break up impermissible consonant clusters; whenever a sonorant is the second segment in a word-final consonant cluster, the cluster is eliminated by syllabifying the sonorant. Neo-Mandaic does not tolerate clusters of the bilabial nasal /m/ and the alveolar trill /r/ in any environment. The voiced bilabial stop /b/ regularly intervenes between these two segments, e.g. &quot;lákamri&quot; [ˈlɑ.kɑm.bri] ‘he didn’t return it.’ Clusters of the voiceless glottal fricative /h/ with another consonant are also not tolerated, even across a syllable boundary; /h/ is generally deleted in this environment.

===Stress===
The accent preferably falls upon a tense vowel within a closed syllable. The placement of the accent is determined from the final syllable. Any final syllable (or ultima) that is closed and contains a tense vowel automatically receives the accent, e.g. &quot;farwɔh&quot; [fær.ˈwɔh] ‘thanks.’ If the final is open or contains a lax vowel, the accent will fall upon the penultimate syllable, provided that it is closed or contains a tense vowel, e.g. &quot;gawrɔ&quot; [ˈgæv.rɔ] ‘man.’ Otherwise, the stress will fall on the final syllable, e.g. &quot;əxal&quot; [a.ˈχɑl] ‘he ate.’ In words of three or more syllables, if neither the ultima nor the penultima is closed and contains a tense vowel, then the accent recedes to the antepenultimate syllable, e.g. &quot;gaṭelnɔxon&quot; [ga.ˈtˤɛl.nɒ.ˌχon] ‘I will kill you.’ Several morphemes automatically take the accent, such as the negative morpheme &quot;lá&quot;-, which causes the accent to shift to the first syllable of the verb which is negated. As in Classical Mandaic and other Aramaic dialects, vowels in open pretonic syllables are regularly subject to reduction.

==Nouns==
The morphology of the noun has been greatly influenced by contact with Persian. The classical system of states has become obsolete, and only vestiges of it survive in some frozen forms and grammatical constructions. As a result, the most common inflectional morphemes associated with the states have been replaced by morphemes borrowed from Persian, such as the plural morphemes ɔn (for native and nativized vocabulary) and -&quot;(h)ɔ&quot; (for words of foreign origin), the indefinite morpheme -&quot;i&quot;, and the &quot;ezɔfe&quot;. 

This last morpheme indicates a relationship between two nouns (substantive or adjective) corresponding to a variety of functions (generally attributive or genitive). In Neo-Mandaic, the attributes of both the Iranian &quot;ezɔfe&quot; and its Classical Mandaic analogue are reconciled. Whenever a noun bearing the nominal augment –&quot;ɔ&quot; is immediately followed by another noun or adjective expressing a genitive or attributive relationship, the augment is regularly apocopated, e.g. &quot;rabbɔ&quot; ‘leader’ but &quot;rab Mandayɔnɔ&quot; ‘leader of the Mandaeans’ and &quot;kədɔwɔ&quot; ‘book’ but &quot;kədɔw Mandɔyí&quot; ‘a Mandaic book.’

===Gender and number===

Despite the collapse of the system of states, and the obsolescence of the most common classical plural morpheme –ia, much of the morphology of the noun has been preserved. While most masculine and feminine nouns alike are marked with the plural morpheme -&quot;ɔn&quot;-, the grammar continues to mark a distinction between the two genders. The feminine plural morpheme -&quot;(w/y)ɔṯ&quot;- most commonly appears on nouns marked explicitly with the feminine singular morpheme -&quot;t&quot;-, although it can also be found on the plural forms of many feminine nouns not marked as such in the singular. Most loan words take the plural morpheme -&quot;(h)ɔ&quot;, although a few retain the plural forms of their source languages. Additionally, many of the heteroclite plurals attested in the classical language have been retained.
===Identifiability and referentiality===

The appearance of the indefinite and plural morphemes on the noun is determined primarily by its pragmatic status, such as the referentiality and identifiability of the referent. &quot;Referentiality&quot; concerns whether the speaker intends a particular, specific entity, which is thus referential, or whether the entity is designated as non-specific or generic, and thus non-referential. Referential nouns are explicitly marked when plural as well as when they serve as the object of a verb, in which case they are marked with the enclitic morpheme əl and anticipated by a pronominal suffix on the verb. The referent of an unmarked noun such as barnɔšɔ can either be specific (‘the person’) or generic (‘people’) but not non-specific (‘a person’). The &quot;identifiability&quot; of a referent reflects whether the speaker assumes that it is identifiable or unidentifiable to the addressee. The indefinite morpheme –&quot;i&quot; indicates that the referent is neither generic nor identifiable, but is ambiguous as to whether the referent is specific (‘a particular person’) or non-specific (‘some person’). Macuch (1965a, 207) has noted that this morpheme, originally borrowed from the Iranian languages, is attested already in the Classical Mandaic texts. Nouns and adjectives modified by the indefinite morpheme -&quot;i&quot; can serve as indefinite pronouns to indicate non-specific or indefinite referents (such as &quot;enši&quot; ‘someone’ and &quot;mendi&quot; ‘something’).
==Pronouns==
There are five types of pronouns in Neo-Mandaic: personal pronouns (both independent and enclitic), demonstrative pronouns, indefinite pronouns (introduced in 3.2. above), interrogative pronouns, and relativizers (introduced in 6. below). The personal pronouns are illustrated to the right.

The independent personal pronouns are optionally employed to represent the subject of a transitive or intransitive verb. Whenever the singular forms appear before a verb, their final vowel is apocopated. The enclitic personal pronouns are in complementary distribution with them; they may represent the object of a transitive verb, a nominal or verbal complement or adjunct in a prepositional phase, or indicate possession on the noun. On nouns of foreign origin, they are affixed by means of the morpheme –&quot;d&quot;-. On the noun &quot;napš&quot;- ‘self’ they also serve to form the reflexive pronouns. Neo-Mandaic also has two reciprocal pronouns, &quot;ham&quot; ‘each other’ and &quot;hədɔdɔ&quot; ‘one another.’
Neo-Mandaic demonstrative pronouns distinguish between near-deixis and far-deixis in the singular, but not in the plural. They also reflect no distinction in gender. The original far-deictic plural demonstrative pronoun &quot;ahni&quot; ‘those’ (classical hania) has assumed the function of a general plural demonstrative pronoun. It is also often used in the place of the independent third plural personal pronoun. The demonstrative pronouns precede the noun they modify. In this position, the final vowel of the singular demonstratives is apocopated (these are the forms listed as ‘contextual,’ e.g. &quot;ɔ šeršɔnɔ&quot; ‘these religions’). Note that the plural demonstrative does not appear in the contextual form; instead, the singular forms are used before plural nouns (the plural morpheme indicating plurality on the whole noun phrase). Neo-Mandaic also has two locative demonstrative pronouns, &quot;hənɔ&quot; / &quot;ehnɔ&quot; ‘here’ and &quot;ekkɔx&quot; ‘there.’

The interrogative pronouns are used to elicit specific information beyond a simple yes or no answer (which can be elicited simply by employing a rising intonation, as in English). Of these interrogative pronouns, only &quot;man&quot; ‘who’ and &quot;mu&quot; ‘what’ may substitute for either the subject or the object of a verb, obligatorily appearing at the beginning of the interrogative clause. Other interrogatives in Neo-Mandaic include &quot;elyɔ&quot; ‘where,’ &quot;hem&quot; ‘which,’ &quot;hemdɔ&quot; ‘when,’ &quot;kammɔ&quot; ‘how,’ &quot;kaṯkammɔ&quot; ‘how much/many,’ &quot;mojur&quot; ‘how, in what way,’ and &quot;qamu&quot; ‘why.’

==Verbs==
The Neo-Mandaic verb may appear in two aspects (perfective and imperfective), three moods (indicative, subjunctive, and imperative), and three voices (active, middle, and passive). As in other Semitic languages, the majority of verbs are built upon a triconsonantal root, each of which may yield one or more of six verbal stems: the G-stem or basic stem, the D-stem or transitivizing-denominative verbal stem, the C-stem or causative verbal stem, and the tG-, tD-, and tC-stems, to which a derivational morpheme, t-, was prefixed before the first root consonant. This morpheme has disappeared from all roots save for those possessing a sibilant as their initial radical, such as &quot;eṣṭəwɔ&quot; ~ &quot;eṣṭəwi&quot; (&quot;meṣṭəwi&quot;) ‘to be baptized’ in the G-stem or &quot;eštallam&quot; ~ &quot;eštallam&quot; (&quot;meštallam&quot;) in the C-stem, in which the stop and the sibilant are metathesized. A seventh stem, the Q-stem, is reserved exclusively for those verbs possessing four root consonants.

Verbs that begin with a vowel rather than a consonant are called I-weak. Verbs beginning with the approximants &quot;n&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, which were susceptible to assimilation in Classical Mandaic, have been reformed on the analogy of the strong verbs. When they appear as the second or third radical of a consonantal root, the liquids &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are susceptible to the general collapse of diphthongs described above. The verbs that are thus affected are known as II-weak and III-weak verbs. Those roots in which the second and third radical consonants were identical have been reformed on the analogy of the II-weak verbs; this process had already begun in Classical Mandaic.

A very large and productive class of verbs in Neo-Mandaic consists of a verbal element and a non-verbal element, which form a single semantic and syntactic unit. The non-verbal element is most often a noun such as &quot;əwɔdɔ&quot; ‘deed’ in the compound &quot;əwɔdɔ əwad&quot; ~ &quot;əwod&quot; (&quot;ɔwed&quot;) ‘to work or to do something,’ or an adjective such as &quot;həyɔnɔ&quot; ‘alive’ in the compound &quot;həyɔnɔ tammɔ&quot; ‘to survive,’ although prepositions such as &quot;qɔr&quot; ‘at,’ in the compound &quot;qɔr tammɔ&quot; ‘to be born to s.o.,’ are attested. In many of these compounds, the verbal element is a &quot;light&quot; verb, which serves only to indicate verbal inflections such as person, tense, mood, and aspect; the meaning of these compounds is primarily derived from the non-verbal element, which always precedes the verbal element. The most common light verbs are &quot;əwad&quot; ~ &quot;əwod&quot; (&quot;ɔwed&quot;) ‘to do,’ &quot;əhaw&quot; ~ &quot;əhow&quot; (&quot;ɔhew&quot;) ‘to give,’ &quot;məhɔ&quot; ~ &quot;məhi&quot; (&quot;mɔhi&quot;) ‘to hit,’ and &quot;tammɔ&quot; ‘to become.’ Although phrasal verbs similar to these are attested in Classical Mandaic, most Neo-Mandaic phrasal verbs are calqued upon Persian phrasal verbs, and many non-verbal elements are Persian or Arabic loan words.

===Principal parts of the verb===

The principal parts upon which all inflected forms of the verb are built are the perfective base (represented by the third masculine singular form of the perfective), the imperative base (represented by the masculine singular form of the imperative), and the imperfective base (represented by the active participle in the absolute state). In the G-stem, the second syllable of the perfective base can have one of three thematic vowels: /a/, /e/, and /o/. Transitive verbs predominantly belong to the first, which is the most common of the three, whereas the latter two typically characterize intransitives and stative verbs. Transitive verbs also commonly yield a passive participle, which takes the form CəCil, e.g. &quot;gəṭil&quot; ‘killed (m.sg.),’ f.sg. &quot;gəṭilɔ&quot; and pl. &quot;gəṭilen&quot;. The D-stem is represented by one passive participle, &quot;əmšabbɔ&quot; ‘praised,’ which belongs to the III-weak root consonant class. The C-stem is also represented by a single III-weak passive participle, &quot;maḥwɔ&quot; ‘kept.’

===Inflected forms of the verb===

The inflected forms of the verbs are produced by adding personal suffixes to the principal parts. The forms given in parentheses were cited by Macuch, who noted that they were infrequently found and not consistently used. The feminine plural forms were not present at all in the texts collected by Häberl, and it would appear that the paradigm is in the process of being leveled towards the masculine forms. Before personal morphemes beginning with a vowel, the vowel of the syllable immediately preceding the suffix is deleted and the former coda becomes the onset for the new syllable. The addition of the morpheme may also cause the accent to shift, resulting in the reduction of vowels in pretonic syllables noted in 2.4. Enclitic object suffixes, introduced above, also have the same effect upon preceding syllables, affecting the form of the personal morpheme. All third person imperfective forms take the enclitic object marker -&quot;l&quot;- before the object suffix. The final consonant of the third plural personal suffix -en regularly assimilates to this enclitic object marker, producing the form -&quot;el(l)&quot;-. Additionally, the second singular and first plural morphemes assume the forms -&quot;ɔt&quot;- and -&quot;nan(n)&quot;- respectively before object suffixes.

===Tense, aspect, mood, and voice===
Aspect is as basic to the Neo-Mandaic verbal system as tense; the inflected forms derived from the participle are imperfective, and as such indicate habitual actions, progressive or inchoative actions, and actions in the future from a past or present perspective. The perfective forms are not only preterite but also resultative-stative, which is most apparent from the verbs relating to a change of state, e.g. &quot;mextat eštɔ&quot; ‘she is dead now,’ using the perfective of &quot;meṯ&quot; ~ &quot;moṯ&quot; (&quot;mɔyeṯ&quot;) ‘to die.’

The indicative is used to make assertions or declarations about situations which the speaker holds to have happened (or, conversely, have not happened), or positions which he maintains to be true. It is also the mood used for questions and other interrogative statements. The perfective, by its very nature, refers to situations that the speaker holds to have happened or not to have happened, and thus pertains to the indicative, apart from explicitly counterfactual conditional clauses, e.g. &quot;agar an láhwit, lá-aṯṯat əl-yanqɔ&quot; ‘if I hadn’t been there, she wouldn’t have brought (=given birth to) the baby.’ The imperfective, on the other hand, is used to describe situations which are ongoing, have yet to happen, or about which there may exist some uncertainty or doubt. When marked by the morpheme &quot;qə&quot;-, it is used to express the indicative, but when it is not thus marked, it expresses the subjunctive. The subjunctive is most commonly used to indicate wishes, possibilities, obligations, and any other statements which may be contrary to present fact. As in the other Semitic languages, the subjunctive must be used in the place of the imperative for all negative commands and prohibitions.

In Neo-Mandaic, the relationship of the action or state described by the verb to its arguments can be described by one of three voices: active, middle voice, and passive. When the action described by the verb is initiated by its grammatical subject, the verb is described as being in the active voice, and the grammatical subject is described as its agent. The t-stems introduced above express the middle voice. The agents of verbs in these stems, which are syntactically active and intransitive, experience the results of these actions as if they were also the patient; in many cases, the action of the verb appears to occur on its own. As a result, verbs in these stems are often translated as if they were agentless passives, or reflexive actions that the subject takes on its own behalf, e.g. &quot;etwer minni wuṣle&quot; ‘a piece broke off / was broken from it.’ In the passive voice, the grammatical subject of the verb is the recipient of the action described by it, namely the patient. There are two ways of forming the passive voice in Neo-Mandaic: the analytic passive, in which the passive participle is combined with the copula, and the much more common impersonal passive, in which an impersonal third plural form is used, e.g. &quot;əmaryon&quot; ‘it is said,’ literally ‘they said.’

==Syntax==
Neo-Mandaic preserves the SVO word order of Classical Mandaic, despite its longstanding contact with Persian (which follows SOV word order). Topic-fronting, which tends to obscure the word order, is typical of all three languages. Simple sentences consist of a subject, which may be implied in the verb, and a predicate, which is headed by a verb or the copula (see Table 9 below). The independent forms of the copula introduce predicate nominal and predicate locative constructions, and the enclitic forms introduce predicate adjectives. Much like other Semitic languages, Neo-Mandaic employs a predicate locative construction to express the notion of possession. In the simple present tense, this construction uses the independent form of the existential particle *&quot;eṯ&quot; and the preposition &quot;l&quot;- ‘to/for,’ which takes the enclitic suffixes introduced in Table 5. Before &quot;l&quot;-, the existential particle assumes the form &quot;eh&quot;-, yielding the forms &quot;ehli&quot; ‘he has’ (lit. ‘there is for him’), &quot;ehla&quot; ‘she has,’ and so forth. In tenses other than the simple present, the copular verb &quot;həwɔ&quot; ~ &quot;həwi&quot; (&quot;hɔwi&quot;) is used in the place of the existential particle, e.g. &quot;agar pərɔhɔ həwɔle, turti zawnit&quot; ‘if I had money, I would have bought a cow.’

Compound sentences combine two or more simple sentences with coordinating conjunctions such as &quot;u&quot; ‘and,’ &quot;ammɔ&quot; ‘but,’ &quot;lo&quot; ‘or,’ and the correlative conjunction -&quot;lo&quot; … -&quot;lo&quot; ‘either … or.’ Complex sentences consist of a main clause and one or more dependent clauses introduced by a relative pronoun, provided that the referent of the antecedent of the clause is definite—if it is indefinite, no relative pronoun is used. The Classical Mandaic relative pronoun d- has not survived, having been replaced by &quot;elli&quot;, an Arabic loan that introduces non-restrictive relative clauses, and &quot;ke&quot;, a Persian loan that introduces restrictive relative clauses, both of which appear immediately following the antecedent of the clause. The antecedents of restrictive relative clauses are marked with the restrictive morpheme –&quot;i&quot;, which resembles the indefinite morpheme in form alone, e.g. &quot;ezgit dukkɔni ke həzitu awwál&quot; ‘I went to the places which I saw before.’ If the antecedent is the object of the relative clause, it will be represented within the relative clause by a resumptive relative pronoun, as in the example above (&quot;həzitu&quot; ‘I saw them’).

==Variation among individual speakers==
There is noticeable variation in pronunciation, lexicon, and morphology among individual speakers of Neo-Mandaic. For example, below are some words and phrases with different forms as noted by Häberl (2009).

Charles G. Häberl worked with Nasser Sobbi in 2003, while Rudolf Macúch worked with Salem Choheili in 1989 and Nasser Saburi in 1953.

Other fluent native speakers of Neo-Mandaic include Salah Choheili (the &quot;rishama&quot; or Mandaean head priest in Australia) and many of his family members.

==Comparison==
The ensemble of the features described above suggest that the grammar of Neo-Mandaic is remarkably conservative in comparison with that of Classical Mandaic, and that most of the features that distinguish the former from the latter (in particular, the restructuring of the nominal morphology and the verbal system) are the result of developments already attested in Classical and Postclassical Mandaic. Unlike the other Neo-Aramaic dialects (apart from Western Neo-Aramaic), Neo-Mandaic alone preserves the old Semitic suffix conjugation (the Neo-Mandaic perfective). 

Apart from the imperative forms, the prefix conjugation (the Classical Mandaic imperfect) has been replaced by the Neo-Mandaic imperfective, which was already anticipated in Classical Mandaic as well. Even the lexicon preserves the vocabulary of Classical Mandaic to a large degree; in a list of 207 of the most common terms in Neo-Mandaic collected by Häberl, over 85% were also attested in the classical language, the remaining 15% deriving primarily from Arabic and Persian. As the latest stage of a classical Aramaic dialect with a long and fairly continuous history of attestation, Neo-Mandaic is potentially of great value for elucidating the typology of the Aramaic dialects as well as the study of the Semitic languages in general.

<text>Gregory Hugh Wannier (1911–1983) was a Swiss physicist. He developed a complete set of orthogonal functions known as the Wannier functions which became tools of the trade for solid-state theorists. He also had made contributions to ferromagnetic theory via the Ising model. The Kramers–Wannier duality yields the exact location of the critical point for the Ising model on the square lattice.

==Biography==
Wannier received his physics PhD under Ernst Stueckelberg at the University of Basel in 1935. He worked with Professor Eugene P. Wigner as a post-doc exchange student at Princeton in the academic year 1936/1937 and later taught at several American universities before a stint in industry from 1946 to 1960. After working at Socony-Vacuum Laboratories, he joined Bell Laboratories in 1949. There he was in the &quot;Physical Electronics&quot; Group with colleagues such as William B. Shockley, Conyers Herring, John Bardeen, Charles Kittel, and Philip W. Anderson.

He returned to academia in 1961 at the University of Oregon, where he retired as professor emeritus in 1977. He published a series of important papers on the properties of crystals, working with graduate students and visiting professors. Additionally, he published widely read textbooks on solid-state theory and statistical mechanics.

He was regarded by many in the department as its most eminent member until his death on October 21, 1983. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society.

<doc id="1093577" wikidata="Q217198" url="?curid=1093577" title="Sergey Karjakin">
<text>Sergey Alexandrovich Karjakin (born 12 January 1990) is a Russian chess grandmaster and politician. A chess prodigy, he previously held the record for the world&#x27;s youngest ever grandmaster, having qualified for the title at the age of 12 years and 7 months. In 12 September 2024, he became a senator for Crimea in the Federation Council of Russia.

Karjakin won the European U10 Chess Championship in 1999 and was the World U12 Chess Champion in 2001. He earned the International Master title at age 11 and was awarded his grandmaster title in 2003. He represented Ukraine at the Chess Olympiad in 2004, winning team and individual gold. He competed in two more Chess Olympiads for Ukraine and won the Corus chess tournament in 2009, before transferring to Russia. He has since represented Russia five times in the Chess Olympiad, winning individual gold in 2010. He also won team gold with Russia at the World Team Chess Championship in 2013 and 2019.

Karjakin won the 2012 World Rapid Chess Championship and the Norway Chess tournament in 2013 and 2014. He competed at the Candidates Tournament 2014, placing second. He won the Chess World Cup 2015, thus qualifying for the Candidates Tournament 2016. He won the tournament and earned the right to challenge for the World Chess Championship. In November 2016, he lost the championship match to Magnus Carlsen in the rapid tiebreaks after drawing 6–6 in the classical games. He won the 2016 World Blitz Chess Championship. He participated in the Candidates tournament again in 2018, placing third, and qualified for the 2022 Candidates by finishing second in the Chess World Cup 2021.

Karjakin&#x27;s public approval of the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted the Grand Chess Tour to ban him for future events. He was also banned from playing FIDE-rated events for six months, including the Candidates Tournament 2022. Following the expiration of his ban, Karjakin has refused to participate in events where he is barred from playing under the Russian flag; this, in conjunction with FIDE&#x27;s ban on Belarusian and Russian flags, meant that Karjakin has been inactive, dropping out of FIDE&#x27;s rating lists in June 2024.

== Prodigy ==
Karjakin learned to play chess when he was five years old. He joined the A.V. Momot Club in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, and was coached by Vladislav Borovikov, becoming an International Master at age 11years and 11months. He won the U10 European championship in 1999 and the U12 world championship in 2001. Also in 2001, Karjakin tied for first place in the U14 European championship with Borki Predojević and Rauf Mamedov, taking the silver medal on tiebreak. In January 2002, he was the official second of fellow Ukrainian Ruslan Ponomariov during the final of the FIDE World Championship, though Karjakin had only just turned 12 at the time.

By scoring grandmaster norms at the Aeroflot Open in Moscow, Alushta tournament in May 2002 and Sudak in August 2002, he surpassed Bu Xiangzhi to become the world&#x27;s youngest grandmaster at the age of 12years 7months―a record that lasted for 19years until 2021, when American player Abhimanyu Mishra achieved the qualifications for the title at the age of 12years, 4months, and 25days. Both Karjakin and Mishra have faced scrutiny for the methods with which they won their qualification, however; Karjakin&#x27;s father has been accused of using methods skirting the norms of chess in enabling such an early attainment of the title.

In 2003, Karjakin won a six-game match against Alexandra Kosteniuk (&quot;Dannemann Classico&quot;) in Brissago by a score of 4–2 and tied for second in the Ukrainian championship.

He competed in the 2004 FIDE World Championship in Tripoli, where he lost in the first round to Mikhail Kobalia. Soon after, Karjakin took part in the Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting. Here he defeated the reigning world champion, Vladimir Kramnik, in a blitz game. In October, Karjakin was the only human to win against a computer in the Man vs Machine World Team Championship in Bilbao, Spain, where he was the youngest and lowest-rated player, beating Deep Junior. At the 36th Chess Olympiad in Calvià, he was the youngest member of the gold-medal-winning Ukrainian team. He also won an individual gold medal thanks to his score of 6½/7 points playing the second reserve board. In December 2004, Karjakin finished second, behind Boris Gelfand at the Pamplona tournament. In the following month, he won the GroupB of the Corus Chess Tournament in Wijk aan Zee, thus qualifying for the 2006 GroupA.

Karjakin entered the world&#x27;s top 100 in the April 2005 FIDE list, at 64th with an Elo rating of 2635. He scored 8½/11 points (+7=3–1) to win the Young Stars of the World tournament held in Kirishi, Russia in May. In July, he tied for third place in the European Individual Championship.

== Career ==
=== 2006 ===

In 2006, Karjakin played for the first time in the Wijk aan Zee Corus A tournament, scoring 7/13 points (4 wins, 6 draws, 3 losses). In the same year, he took part in the NH Chess Tournament in Amsterdam; it was a match between two teams, &quot;Rising Stars&quot; (made up of Karjakin, Magnus Carlsen, Wang Hao, Daniel Stellwagen, and Jan Smeets) and &quot;Experience&quot; (Alexander Beliavsky, Artur Yusupov, John Nunn, and Ulf Andersson), held with the Scheveningen system. The former won by 28–22.

=== 2007 ===
Karjakin played again in the NH Chess Tournament for team &quot;Rising Stars&quot;, which beat &quot;Experience&quot; by 26½–23½. He was the best player, having scored 7/10, and this earned him an invitation for the 2008 Amber chess tournament.
In October 2007, Karjakin finished second behind Bu Xiangzhi in the blindfold chess World Cup in Bilbao, scoring 17 points after five wins, two draws and three losses (the scoring system was 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss).

During the Chess World Cup 2007, which served as a qualification tournament for the World Chess Championship 2010, Karjakin reached the semi-finals, in which he lost to Alexei Shirov. On the January 2008 FIDE rating list, published just before Karjakin&#x27;s 18th birthday, he passed the 2700 mark for the first time, often seen as the line that separates &quot;elite&quot; players from other grandmasters, with a new rating of 2732 and a world rank of 13.

=== 2008–2010 ===
In July 2008, Karjakin convincingly won a rapid chess match against GM Nigel Short 7½–2½.

In February 2009, he won his first elite tournament in the A group of the Corus chess tournament in Wijk aan Zee (category XIX), with a score of 8/13.

He won the ACP World Rapid Cup, which was conducted from 27 to 29May 2010, defeating Dmitry Jakovenko in the final by 4–3.

=== 2011 ===
In June 2011, Karjakin took second place in the Bazna Kings Tournament in Mediaș, Romania, after sharing the lead with Magnus Carlsen in the final round, and after ranking was then determined by the tournament&#x27;s official tie-break regulations. The final standings listed Carlsen followed by Karjakin, then Hikaru Nakamura, Teimour Radjabov, Vassily Ivanchuk, and Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu. The results affected the world rankings, as Carlsen reclaimed first place, and Karjakin passed Kramnik for fourth place.

In November, Karjakin shared third place with Vassily Ivanchuk and Ian Nepomniachtchi in the category 22 Tal Memorial in Moscow.

=== 2012: World Rapid Champion ===

In July 2012, Karjakin won the World Rapid Chess Championship, a full point ahead of world number one Magnus Carlsen in Astana, Kazakhstan. In the same month, he also tied for first at Dortmund with Fabiano Caruana but came in second after tiebreak. In November–December 2012, Karjakin shared first place with Wang Hao and Alexander Morozevich with 6½/9 in the FIDE Grand Prix event held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

=== 2013–2014 ===
In May, he won the inaugural edition of Norway Chess, scoring 6½/9 (+6−2=1), half a point ahead of Carlsen.

In March 2014, he finished second place in the FIDE Candidates Tournament held in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, behind Viswanathan Anand. His second at the event was former FIDE World Champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov.

In June 2014, Karjakin won the Norway Chess tournament for the second year running. In this tournament, he competed against nine other players, six of which were rated in the FIDE top10.

=== 2015 ===
Karjakin won the Chess World Cup 2015 after going down 0–2 to former World Cup Champion Peter Svidler, eventually winning 6–4 in blitz tiebreaks. By finishing in the top two, Karjakin qualified, along with Svidler, for the 2016 Candidates Tournament.

In the same year, he took part in the Russia–China Challenge Match. The first part of the event took place from 29July to 1August in the Heixiazi Island, where Karjakin sequentially knocked out four of the five members in the Chinese team: Wei Yi, Ding Liren, Ni Hua and Yu Yangyi. In the second half of the event, which was held in Harbin in December, he also defeated Wang Yue, leading team Russia to victory.

=== 2016: Candidates winner and World Blitz Champion ===
In March 2016, Karjakin won the 2016 Candidates Tournament in Moscow and qualified to play a match against Magnus Carlsen for the title of World Chess Champion. He defeated Fabiano Caruana in the last round of the tournament to finish with 8½ out of 14, one point ahead of Caruana and Anand.

The World Chess Championship 2016 took place 11–30November 2016 in New York City. The format consisted of a maximum of 12 games played under a long classical time control, ending with possible speed chess tiebreak games and an Armageddon game to ensure a winner. Karjakin&#x27;s record against Carlsen in classical games before the World Championship was: 1win, 4losses, and 16draws. Karjakin won the eighth game, but lost the tenth, leaving the match tied 6–6. Carlsen defeated Karjakin 3–1 in the rapid tiebreaks and won the match. This remains the last time Carlsen was defeated in a classical or rapid game in the finals of a World Chess Championship having gone unbeaten in the rapid tiebreaks with Karjakin and in his subsequent matches with Caruana in 2018 (both in the classical portion and in the rapid tiebreaks) and Nepomniachtchi in 2021.

Karjakin won the 2016 World Blitz Chess Championship, which took place on 29 and 30December 2016. Before the last round, Carlsen was leading with 16.0/20, while Karjakin was half a point behind. In the last round, Carlsen drew with Peter Leko, while Karjakin won against Baadur Jobava. Thus, they both finished the tournament with 16½/21. The tie-break (the Elo average of the opponents) was used to decide the winner, and as Karjakin&#x27;s opponents had the better average, Karjakin was crowned 2016 World Blitz Champion. The extent of Karjakin&#x27;s and Carlsen&#x27;s domination in the event was shown by the fact that their closest rivals, Daniil Dubov, Hikaru Nakamura and Alexander Grischuk (three-time world blitz champion), were a full two points behind.

=== 2017–2018 ===

In December, he participated in the London Chess Classic, placing eighth with a score of 3½/9.

In January, Karjakin competed in the Tata Steel Masters. He placed seventh, scoring 7½/13 (+2−0=11).

In March, he competed in the Candidates Tournament 2018. He finished third with 8/14 (+4−2=8), one point behind the winner Caruana.

In April, he participated in the fifth edition of Shamkir Chess, finishing third with a score of 5/9 (+1−0=8).

From 28 May to 7 June, he competed in the sixth edition of Norway Chess, finishing last with 3/8 (+1−3=4).

=== 2019–2020 ===
In March 2019, Karjakin competed as part of the Russian team at the World Team Championship in Astana, Kazakhstan. He was defeated by the Kazakh grandmaster Rinat Dzhumabaev. Despite this, the Russian team took first place in the tournament.

From 31 March to 9 April, he competed in Shamkir Chess 2019. He placed in a tie for second, with 5points out of9.

From 5 to 16 December 2020, Karjakin competed in the 73rd Russian Chess Championship. He finished with a score of 7/11, which earned him second place behind winner Ian Nepomniachtchi.

=== 2021 ===
In July–August 2021, Karjakin competed in the Chess World Cup 2021. In round five, Karjakin defeated French GM Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in the rapid tiebreaker after drawing the classical games. He then knocked out US GM Sam Shankland in the quarterfinals and eliminated Russian GM Vladimir Fedoseev in the semifinals to qualify for the Candidates Tournament 2022. Eventually, Karjakin lost to Polish GM Jan-Krzysztof Duda in the finals to finish second.

Karjakin criticised Daniil Dubov for serving as a second for Magnus Carlsen in the World Chess Championship 2021 against Ian Nepomniachtchi. This was also criticised by Sergei Shipov, who along with Karjakin said that Dubov should not have helped a non-Russian in a match against a fellow Russian. Dubov responded that he considered it to be a match between two individuals and counter-argued that working with Carlsen would improve his chess and hence help the Russian team.

From 26–28 December 2021, Karjakin participated in the 2021 FIDE World Rapid Championship, where he ended up in 11th place with 9/13 points after tiebreaks.

=== 2022–present ===
In January 2022, he competed in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2022, where he finished tied for fifth with a score of 7/13. Controversy arose among spectators after the tenth round when Karjakin and Carlsen drew by three-fold repetition after 16moves in 20minutes, with Karjakin&#x27;s deciding to enter a drawn line of the Berlin Defence. After the game, Karjakin tweeted &quot;#drawmagnus #saynoto2900&quot;.

==== Suspension ====
In February 2022, the Crimea-born Karjakin, who had transferred from the Ukrainian Chess Federation to the Russian Chess Federation in 2009, came out in vocal support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This led FIDE to refer him (as well as fellow Grandmaster Sergei Shipov) to the Ethics and Disciplinary Commission. While the investigation was ongoing, several chess tournaments and platforms banned Karjakin: the Grand Chess Tour did so in early March, saying &quot;the GCT Board has determined that Grandmaster Sergey Karjakin is banned from all upcoming and future GCT events due to his recent hostile comments on social media supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine&quot;, while Chess.com banned him from participating in all prize tournaments that same month.

In March 2022, the FIDE Ethics and Disciplinary Commission banned him from playing any FIDE-rated events for six months. The Russian Chess Federation filed an appeal, which was denied. The decision meant that Karjakin was not able to participate in the Candidates Tournament 2022. In a post to his Telegram channel, Karjakin denounced FIDE for conflating sports with politics. He further declared that he considers himself a patriot first and a chess player second, and that he did not regret anything. His public approval of the invasion led to Russian President Vladimir Putin awarding him a Medal of the Order &quot;For Merit to the Fatherland&quot; in June 2022.

After the suspension ended in September 2022, Karjakin continued a self-imposed &quot;ban&quot; by refusing to participate in any tournament where he could not play under the Russian flag. Notably, Karjakin opted out of playing at the 2023 Chess World Cup despite his eligibility to play at the event due to rating, reiterating his disapproval for &quot;the upcoming tournament [where] I can&#x27;t represent my country, play under my (country&#x27;s) flag, and if I successfully perform, I will not hear my country&#x27;s national anthem.&quot;

Since January 2022, Karjakin has () only played two classical FIDE-rated games, at the Russian Team Championship in May 2023.

== Playing style ==
Karjakin is known for his defensive skills, which has earned him an informal nickname as Russia&#x27;s &quot;Minister of Defense&quot;. He successfully defended inferior positions against World Champion Magnus Carlsen – himself known for grinding out wins from slightly superior positions – in the World Chess Championship 2016, especially games 3 and 4. Karjakin has no qualms about entering an endgame with a small disadvantage if he deems it his best option as opposed to playing for complications. He is, however, also capable of aggressive play if the position demands it, such as in a 30-move victory over Veselin Topalov at the Gashimov Memorial 2017.

== Personal life ==
Karjakin is an ethnic Russian.
On 25 July 2009, by the decree of the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, Karjakin adopted Russian citizenship. Later that year he transferred chess federations from Ukraine to Russia. He has lived in Moscow since 2009.

In 2013 he graduated from the Russian State Social University with a degree in social pedagogy.

Karjakin, an Eastern Orthodox Christian, married Galiya Kamalova, secretary of the Moscow chess federation, in May 2014. They have two sons, one born in 2015 and the other born in 2017. He was previously married since 2009 to Ukrainian chess player Kateryna Dolzhykova.

In January 2024, Karjakin was involved in a very serious motor vehicle accident, being the passenger of the car that flipped multiple times. He suffered rib fractures. However, his injuries were not life-threatening. Later that year, in February 2024, Karjakin visited the ruins of the Ukrainian town Avdiivka, which had recently been occupied by Russian forces. He took selfies there in military gear.

== Political views ==
Karjakin is known for his strong support for Vladimir Putin.

In 2022, he publicly endorsed the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Sanctions ==
In 2022, Karjakin was sanctioned by Ukraine for his public endorsement and approval of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Karjakin was stripped of his Ukrainian state awards on 19 January 2025 by a decree of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

<text>The Division of Bruce is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. The division is located in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It covers an area of approximately including the suburbs of , , , , , , , and ; and parts of , , , , , , and .

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1955, and is named for Stanley Bruce, who was Prime Minister of Australia from 1923 to 1929. Unusually, the division was named after a living person, as Bruce did not die until 1967.

Until 1996, the division was based on Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley, and was a fairly safe seat for the Liberal Party, but since then its boundaries have been extended southwards, making it a marginal Labor Party seat.

Its most prominent member was Sir Billy Snedden, Liberal Party leader from 1972 to 1975 and Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 1976 to 1983. At the 2011 Census, the division had the nation&#x27;s highest proportion of residents born overseas (50.8%), and the third highest proportion born in a non-English speaking country (45.4%). It also has the sixth highest proportion speaking a language other than English at home (51.6%), the highest for any Victorian electorate.

The current Member for Bruce, since the 2016 federal election, is Julian Hill, who is a member of the Australian Labor Party.

== Demographics ==
Bruce is a diverse and socially conservative electorate and is historically working-class. Bruce has three times the proportion of families with Chinese backgrounds as the state average. While a stronghold for the center-left Labor Party, religious migrant communities in the electorate rallied strongly against the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey in 2017, since the survey process was not trusted by both Islamic and Chinese Christian migrant communities, who believe it had been hijacked by out-of-touch inner-city leaders.

<doc id="1093594" wikidata="Q5920990" url="?curid=1093594" title="Howard Street Tunnel fire">
<text>The Howard Street Tunnel fire (also known as the Baltimore Freight Rail Crash) was a 60-car CSX Transportation freight train derailment that occurred in the Howard Street Tunnel, a freight through-route tunnel under Howard Street in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 18, 2001. The derailment sparked a chemical fire that raged for five or six days and virtually shut down the downtown area. In the evening of the first day, a water main ruptured causing significant flooding in the streets above. The accident disrupted Northeast Corridor rail service. It also slowed Internet service in the US for several hours due to the destruction of a cable passing through the tunnel.

==The derailment and fire==
The train consisted of 60 cars. Cars 46 through 56 derailed in the Howard Street Tunnel at 3:08 PM, and became disconnected from the first 45 cars. The train experienced an automatic emergency brake application resulting from the separation of the train, but the crew didn&#x27;t realise that a derailment had taken place. Around 3:26 they moved the locomotives out of the tunnel.

Around 4 PM smoke was seen coming from a sewer near the intersection of Howard and Lombard Streets, and the fire department was notified. Later, smoke emerged from the ends of the tunnel and from several manholes. Eventually it was found that one of the derailed tank cars, carrying tripropylene, had ruptured and the escaping flammable liquid had caught fire. This fire also ignited paper and wood products in other cars. Another tank car ruptured releasing of hydrochloric acid. Around 6:15 a 40-inch cast iron water main above the tunnel burst due to deformation, eventually releasing about of water. The fire burned for about 5 days.

A National Transportation Safety Board report took three years to be prepared. The investigation was not able to find the cause of the accident.

A numerical simulation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that the peak calculated temperatures within the tunnel were approximately within the flaming regions, and on average approximately when averaged over a length of the tunnel equal to three to four rail car lengths. Due to the insulation of the tunnel&#x27;s thick brick walls, the temperature was relatively uniform across all the cars, approaching temperatures normally found in an oven or furnace: The peak wall surface temperature reached about where the flames were directly impinging, and on average over the length of three to four rail cars.

==Impact on Baltimore downtown region==

Thousands of Baltimore workers were forced to leave their jobs and unable to come back for several days until the city could assure that there was no further danger from either the fire or the water main flooding. The crash also impacted MARC passenger train service for several days; bus routes were set up by the city to ferry passengers to and from the BWI Amtrak/MARC station as an alternate route. MARC service was restored on July 23, 2001.

Most of the roads around Howard Street, including I-395 spur into Baltimore, experienced extremely heavy congestion due to street closures around the intersection of Howard and Lombard Streets, where the actual water main break occurred. By July 24, 2001, all but the blocks immediately surrounding the water main break were reopened to automotive traffic.

Three weeks later, manhole covers flew into the air as underground explosions along West Pratt Street occurred due to residual explosive chemicals from the fire in the sewers.

Smoke from the incident and flooding from the broken water main caused three Baltimore Orioles baseball home games to be canceled that summer, as Oriole Park at Camden Yards was directly in the danger zone caused by the fire.

==Impact on East Coast rail traffic==

The Howard Street Tunnel is on the only direct rail link on the CSX rail line from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. The only other direct rail link is the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, a passenger line with only limited freight operations performed by Norfolk Southern Railway. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) report on the incident, officials had long known that the possibility existed for a fire or other disaster to cause a significant problem in the Howard Street Tunnel. An article published in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; on July 19, 2001, contains a 1985 quote from an unidentified federal transportation safety official who observed, &quot;... the problem would be getting in there to fight the fire... If you had an explosion, fire would shoot out of both ends like a bazooka.&quot; However, freight traffic on the line had been increasing for years as CSX and Conrail diverted traffic away from Amtrak lines to avoid Amtrak/Conrail crashes like the one in Chase, Maryland in 1987. Estimates from railway publications put the freight traffic through the Howard Street Tunnel at 28 to 32 trains per day.

According to a November 2005 report to Congress:
The tunnel closing caused major disruption to CSXT freight traffic, Maryland Rail Commuter (MARC) commuter trains, and to Central Light Rail Line trains and bus lines that traversed Howard Street. To avoid the Howard Street Tunnel, CSXT had to send freight trains west to Cleveland, north to Albany, New York, and then south to Baltimore, incurring a three- to four-day delay. Some CSXT trains were rerouted via the busy NS line through Manassas, Virginia, Hagerstown, Maryland, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
At one point during the fire, eight CSXT trains that would have used the tunnel were detouring through Cumberland, Maryland, and Youngstown Ohio; five through Hagerstown and Harrisburg; five through Cleveland and Albany, New York; and 12 trains were stopping in various yards.

According to the DOT report on the incident, firefighting efforts could not begin until the exact location of the fire within the tunnel could be found, which finally occurred at 5:00 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time, 10:00 UTC) on July 19, 2001. Work on repairing the break in the water main enabled the firemen to find a manhole cover on Howard Street through which they could gain access to both the broken water main and the tunnel itself, and firefighting efforts began in earnest. Three rail cars (boxcars of paper and plywood) were removed from the tunnel and their flaming contents were extinguished the morning of July 22, 2001. Once the water main break was finally stopped on the same day, tunnel inspectors could enter the area. Amazingly, there were no significant structural damages, and the tunnel was officially reopened to traffic at 7:45 a.m. on July 23, 2001.

==Impact on other services==
Beyond the adverse effects on railroad traffic, there was a massive effect on life and activities in downtown Baltimore. The incident forced the closing of streets and business over much of downtown for several days.

According to a November 2005 Report to Congress
* Officials cancelled three Baltimore Orioles games, resulting in a $5 million loss to the team.
* They also closed Howard Street, along with 14 other cross streets, for five days.
* A two-block stretch of Howard Street remained closed for six more weeks.
* MTA Maryland rerouted 23 bus lines, and MARC Train service to Camden Station was suspended.
* The fire and burst water main damaged power cables and left 1,200 Baltimore buildings without electricity.
* Severed fiber-optic lines backed up traffic regionally and nationally because the fiber-optic cable through the tunnel is a major line for the extremely busy Northeast Corridor.
* The Inner Harbor was closed to boat traffic.
* A water-main break near the tunnel added to the chaos, causing the collapse of part of a major thoroughfare and power outages.

The severed optical fiber cable in the tunnel was a major east coast internet communication link belonging to WorldCom. The break slowed internet service around the US for several hours; water from the water main break caused further damage to the communication lines. According to the DoT report, WorldCom was able to install a fully redundant network bypass around the incident within 36 hours, allowing resumption of east coast and transatlantic internet communications.

The aftermath of the fire affected some activities for longer periods. 
* MTA shut down light rail service through the city for over seven weeks, with shuttle buses running between the North Avenue and Patapsco stations, and later between North Avenue and Camden.
* The intersection at Howard and Lombard streets, one of the busiest in the city, was not re-opened until September 5.

<text>The Montreal-style bagel or Montreal bagel (sometimes beigel; ; ) is a distinctive variety of handmade and wood-fired baked bagel. In contrast to the New York–style bagel, the Montreal bagel is smaller, thinner, sweeter and denser, with a larger hole, and is always baked in a wood-fired oven. It contains malt, egg, and no salt, and is boiled in honey-sweetened water before being baked.

In some Montreal establishments, bagels are still produced by hand and baked in full view of the patrons. There are two predominant varieties: black-seed (poppy seed), or white-seed (sesame seed).

==History==
Montreal bagels, like the similarly shaped New York bagel, were brought to North America by Jewish immigrants from Poland and other Eastern European countries; the differences in texture and taste reflect the style of the particular area in Poland in which the immigrant bakers learned their trade. Minor controversy surrounds the question of who first brought the bagel to Montreal. They were (reportedly) first baked in Montreal by Chaim (Hyman) Seligman, as verified by Montreal historian Joe King, a historian of Montreal Jewry. Seligman first worked in the neighbourhood community of Lachine and later moved his bakery to the lane next door to Schwartz&#x27;s Delicatessen on Boulevard St. Laurent in central Montreal. Seligman would string his bagels into dozens and patrol Jewish Main purveying his wares, originally with a pushcart, then a horse and wagon and still later from a converted taxi. Seligman went into partnership with Myer Lewkowicz and with Jack Shlafman but fell out with both of them. Seligman and Lewkowicz founded the St. Viateur Bagel Shop in 1957 and Shlafman established Fairmount Bagel in 1919, which both still exist in the present day.

==Dissemination==
A substantial proportion of Montreal&#x27;s English-speaking Jewish community gradually left for other locales. Catering to this population, Montreal-style bagel shops have opened in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Whitehorse, and other Canadian, cities. They have even spread to the UK and some US cities, such as Burlington, Houston, Los Angeles, Oakland, Portland, and Seattle. For a time this style of bagel was almost completely unknown in the northeastern U.S., mainly due to the proximity of the rival New York City bagel. (with one exception having been in Burlington, Vermont, where Myer&#x27;s Bagels boasts a Montreal-style wood-fired oven and Lloyd Squires, a former St-Viateur Bagel Shop baker). At one point in New York City there were two Montreal-style bagel locations in the borough of Brooklyn within four blocks of each other, but one is now closed and the other no longer offers Montreal-style bagels.

Montreal-style bagels are currently the only style of bagel known to have ventured into space. Gregory Chamitoff, who grew up in Montreal, took three bags of sesame bagels with him on his assignments to STS-124 as passenger and ISS Expedition 17 as crewmember.

==Production==

Montreal-style bagels are, for the most part, manufactured by the same method used to produce a generic bagel.
The Montreal-style method of making bagels builds on the basic traditional method in the following ways:
* The basic bagel dough recipe includes egg and honey.
* Honey is also added to the water used for poaching the bagels before baking.
* The authentic Montreal-style bagels are baked in a wood-fired oven.

==Notable bagel shops==
Several Montreal bagel factories produce authentic Montreal-style bagels. St-Viateur Bagel, at 263 av. St-Viateur Ouest, and Fairmount Bagel, at 74 Avenue Fairmount West are two notable bagel shops in Montreal. Both claim to be the oldest bagel shop in the city.

<doc id="1093599" wikidata="Q1331380" url="?curid=1093599" title="Derailment">
<text>In rail transport, a derailment is a type of train wreck that occurs when a rail vehicle such as a train comes off its rails. Although many derailments are minor, all result in temporary disruption of the proper operation of the railway system and they are a potentially serious hazard.

A derailment of a train can be caused by a collision with another object, an operational error (such as excessive speed through a curve), the mechanical failure of tracks (such as broken rails), or the mechanical failure of the wheels, among other causes. In emergency situations, deliberate derailment with derails or catch points is sometimes used to prevent a more serious accident.

== History ==

The first recorded train derailment in history is known as the Hightstown rail accident in New Jersey that occurred on 8 November 1833. The train was traveling between Hightstown and Spotswood, New Jersey, and derailed after an axle broke on one of the carriages as a result of a journal box catching fire. The derailment resulted in one fatality and twenty-three injuries, and it was recorded that both New York railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt and former U.S president John Quincy Adams were on the train as it took place, in which Adams wrote about the event in his journal.

During the 19th century derailments were commonplace, but progressively improved safety measures have resulted in a stable lower level of such incidents. A sampling of annual approximate numbers of derailments in the United States includes 3000 in 1980, 1000 in 1986, 500 in 2010, and 1000 in 2022.

Derailments in the United States
== Causes ==
Derailments result from one or more of a number of distinct causes; these may be classified as:

* the primary mechanical failure of a track component (for example broken rails, gauge spread due to sleeper (tie) failure)
* the primary mechanical failure of a component of the running gear of a vehicle (for example axlebox failure, wheel breakage)
* a fault in the geometry of the track components or the running gear that results in a quasi-static failure in running (for example rail climbing due to excessive wear of wheels or rails, earthworks slip)
* a dynamic effect of the track-vehicle interaction (for example extreme Hunting oscillation, vertical bounce, track shift under a train, excessive speed)
* improper operation of points, or improper observance of signals protecting them (signal errors)
* as a secondary event following collision with other trains, road vehicles, or other obstructions (level crossing collisions, obstructions on the line)
* train handling (snatches due to sudden traction or braking forces, referred to as slack action in North America).


=== Broken rails ===
Broken rails are a leading cause of derailments. According to data from the Federal Railroad Administration, broken rails and welds are the most common reason for train derailments, making up more than 15 percent of derailment cases.
A traditional track structure consists of two rails, fixed at a designated distance apart (known as the track gauge), and supported on transverse sleepers (ties). Some advanced track structures support the rails on a concrete or asphalt slab. The running surface of the rails is required to be practically continuous and of the proper geometrical layout.

In the event of a broken or cracked rail, the rail running surface may be disrupted if a piece has fallen out, or become lodged in an incorrect location, or if a large gap between the remaining rail sections arises. 170 broken (not cracked) rails were reported on Network Rail in the UK in 2008, down from a peak of 988 in 1998/1999.

* In jointed track, rails are usually connected with bolted fishplates (joint bars). The web of the rail experiences large shear forces and these are enhanced around the bolt hole. Where track maintenance is poor, metallurgical fatigue can result in the propagation of star cracking from the bolthole. In extreme situations this can lead to a triangular piece of rail at the joint becoming detached.
* Metallurgical changes take place due to the phenomenon of gauge corner cracking (in which fatigue microcracking propagates faster than ordinary wear), and also due to the effects of hydrogen inclusion during the manufacturing process, leading to crack propagation under fatigue loading.
* Local embrittlement of the parent metal may take place due to wheel spin (traction units rotating driving wheels without movement along the track).
* Rail welds (where rail sections are joined by welding) may fail due to poor workmanship; this may be triggered by extremely cold weather or improper stressing of continuously welded rails, such that high tensile forces are generated in the rails.
* The fishplates (joint bars) in jointed track may fail, allowing the rails to pull apart in extremely cold weather; this is usually associated with uncorrected rail creep.

Derailment may take place due to excessive gauge widening (sometimes known as road spread), in which the sleepers or other fastenings fail to maintain the proper gauge. In lightly engineered track where rails are spiked (dogged) to timber sleepers, spike hold failure may result in rotation outwards of a rail, usually under the aggravating action of crabbing of bogies (trucks) on curves.

The mechanism of gauge widening is usually gradual and relatively slow, but if it is undetected, the final failure often takes place under the effect of some additional factor, such as excess speed, poorly maintained running gear on a vehicle, misalignment of rails, and extreme traction effects (such as high propelling forces). The crabbing effect referred to above is more marked in dry conditions, when the coefficient of friction at the wheel to rail interface is high.

=== Defective wheels ===
The running gear – wheelsets, bogies (trucks), and suspension—may fail. The most common historical failure mode is collapse of plain bearings due to deficient lubrication, and failure of leaf springs; wheel tyres are also prone to failure due to metallurgical crack propagation.

Modern technologies have reduced the incidence of these failures considerably, both by design (specially the elimination of plain bearings) and intervention (non-destructive testing in service).

=== Unusual track interaction ===
If a vertical, lateral, or crosslevel irregularity is cyclic and takes place at a wavelength corresponding to the natural frequency of certain vehicles traversing the route section, there is a risk of resonant harmonic oscillation in the vehicles, leading to extreme improper movement and possibly derailment. This is most hazardous when a cyclic roll is set up by crosslevel variations, but vertical cyclical errors also can result in vehicles lifting off the track; this is especially the case when the vehicles are in the tare (empty) condition, and if the suspension is not designed to have appropriate characteristics. The last condition applies if the suspension springing has a stiffness optimised for the loaded condition, or for a compromise loading condition, so that it is too stiff in the tare situation.

The vehicle wheelsets become momentarily unloaded vertically so that the guidance required from the flanges or wheel tread contact is inadequate.

A special case is heat related buckling: in hot weather the rail steel expands. This is managed by stressing continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder. If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain).

=== Improper operation of control systems ===
Junctions and other changes of routing on railways are generally made by means of points (switches – movable sections capable of changing the onward route of vehicles). In the early days of railways these were moved independently by local staff. Accidents – usually collisions – took place when staff forgot which route the points were set for, or overlooked the approach of a train on a conflicting route. If the points were not correctly set for either route – set in mid-stroke – it is possible for a train passing to derail.

The first concentration of levers for signals and points brought together for operation was at Bricklayer&#x27;s Arms Junction in south-east London in the period 1843–1844. The signal control location (forerunner of the signalbox) was enhanced by the provision of interlocking (preventing a clear signal being set for a route that was not available) in 1856.

To prevent the unintended movement of freight vehicles from sidings to running lines, and other analogous improper movements, trap points and derails are provided at the exit from the sidings. In some cases these are provided at the convergence of running lines. It occasionally happens that a driver incorrectly believes they have authority to proceed over the trap points, or that the signaller improperly gives such permission; this results in derailment. The resulting derailment does not always fully protect the other line: a trap point derailment at speed may well result in considerable damage and obstruction, and even a single vehicle may obstruct the clear line.

=== Derailment following collision ===
If a train collides with a massive object, it is clear that derailment of the proper running of vehicle wheels on the track may take place. Although very large obstructions are imagined, it has been known for a cow straying on to the line to derail a passenger train at speed such as occurred in the Polmont rail accident.

The most common obstructions encountered are road vehicles at level crossings (grade crossings); malicious persons sometimes place materials on the rails, and in some cases relatively small objects cause a derailment by guiding one wheel over the rail (rather than by gross collision).

Derailment has also been brought about in situations of war or other conflict, such as during hostility by Native Americans, and more especially during periods when military personnel and materiel was being moved by rail.

=== Harsh train handling ===
The handling of a train can also cause derailments. The vehicles of a train are connected by couplings; in the early days of railways these were short lengths of chain (&quot;loose couplings&quot;) that connected adjacent vehicles with considerable slack. Even with later improvements there may be a considerable slack between the traction situation (power unit pulling the couplings tight), and power unit braking (locomotive applying brakes and compressing buffers throughout the train). This results in coupling surge.

More sophisticated technologies in use nowadays generally employ couplings that have no loose slack, although there is elastic movement at the couplings; continuous braking is provided, so that every vehicle on the train has brakes controlled by the driver. Generally this uses compressed air as a control medium, and there is a measurable time lag as the signal (to apply or release brakes) propagates along the train.

If a train driver applies the train brakes suddenly and severely, the front part of the train is subject to braking forces first. (Where only the locomotive has braking, this effect is obviously more extreme). The rear part of the train may overrun the front part, and in cases where coupling condition is imperfect, the resultant sudden closing up (an effect referred to as a &quot;run-in&quot;) may result in a vehicle in tare condition (an empty freight vehicle) being lifted momentarily, and leaving the track. This effect was relatively common in the nineteenth century.

On curved sections, the longitudinal (traction or braking) forces between vehicles have a component inward or outward respectively on the curve. In extreme situations these lateral forces may be enough to produce derailment.

A special case of train handling problems is overspeed on sharp curves. This generally arises when a driver fails to slow the train for a sharp curved section in a route that otherwise has higher speed conditions. In the extreme this results in the train entering a curve at a speed at which it cannot negotiate the curve, and gross derailment takes place. The specific mechanism of this may involve bodily tipping (rotation) but is likely to involve disruption of the track structure and derailment as the primary failure event, followed by overturning.

Fatal instances include the Santiago de Compostela derailment in 2013 and the Philadelphia train derailment two years later of trains traveling about . Both went at about twice the maximum allowable speed for the curved section of track.

=== Flange climbing ===
The guidance system of practical railway vehicles relies on the steering effect of the conicity of the wheel treads on moderate curves (down to a radius of about 500 m, or about 1,500 feet). On sharper curves flange contact takes place, and the guiding effect of the flange relies on a vertical force (the vehicle weight).

A flange climbing derailment can result if the relationship between these forces, L/V, is excessive. The lateral force L results not only from centrifugal effects, but a large component is from the crabbing of a wheelset which has a non-zero angle of attack during running with flange contact. The L/V excess can result from wheel unloading, or from improper rail or wheel tread profiles. The physics of this is more fully described below, in the section &quot;wheel-rail interaction&quot;.

Wheel unloading can be caused by twist in the track. This can arise if the cant (crosslevel, or superelevation) of the track varies considerably over the wheelbase of a vehicle, and the vehicle suspension is very stiff in torsion. In the quasi-static situation it may arise in extreme cases of poor load distribution, or on extreme cant at low speed.

If a rail has been subject to extreme sidewear, or a wheel flange has been worn to an improper angle, it is possible for the L/V ratio to exceed the value that the flange angle can resist.

If weld repair of side-worn switches is undertaken, it is possible for poor workmanship to produce a ramp in the profile in the facing direction, that deflects an approaching wheel flange on to the rail head.

In extreme situations, the infrastructure may be grossly distorted or even absent; this may arise from a variety of causes, including earthwork movement (embankment slips and washouts), earthquakes and other major terrestrial disruptions, or deficient protection during work processes, among others.

==== Wheel-rail interaction ====

Nearly all practical railway systems use wheels fixed to a common axle: the wheels on both sides rotate in unison. Tramcars requiring low floor levels are the exception, but much benefit in vehicle guidance is lost by having unlinked wheels.

The benefit of linked wheels derives from the conicity of the wheel treads—the wheel treads are not cylindrical, but conical. On idealised straight track, a wheelset would run centrally, midway between the rails.

The example shown here uses a right-curving section of track. The focus is on the left-side wheel, which is more involved with the forces critical to guiding the railcar through the curve.

Diagram 1 below shows the wheel and rail with the wheelset running straight and central on the track. The wheelset is running away from the observer. (Note that the rail is shown inclined inwards; this is done on modern track to match the rail head profile to the wheel tread profile.)

Diagram 2 shows the wheelset displaced to the left, due to curvature of the track or a geometrical irregularity. The left wheel (shown here) is now running on a slightly larger diameter; the right wheel opposite has moved to the left as well, towards the centre of the track, and is running on a slightly smaller diameter. As the two wheels rotate at the same rate, the forward speed of the left wheel is a little faster than the forward speed of the right wheel. This causes the wheelset to curve to the right, correcting the displacement. This takes place without flange contact; the wheelsets steer themselves on moderate curves without any flange contact.

The sharper the curve, the greater the lateral displacement necessary to achieve the curving. On a very sharp curve (typically less than about 500 m or 1,500 feet radius) the width of the wheel tread is not enough to achieve the necessary steering effect, and the wheel flange contacts the face of the high rail.

Diagram 3 shows the running of wheelsets in a bogie or a four-wheeled vehicle. The wheelset is not running parallel to the track: it is constrained by the bogie frame and suspension, and it is yawing to the outside of the curve; that is, its natural rolling direction would lead along a less sharply curved path than the actual curve of the track.

The angle between the natural path and the actual path is called the angle of attack (or the yaw angle). As the wheelset rolls forward, it is forced to slide across the railhead by the flange contact. The whole wheelset is forced to do this, so the wheel on the low rail is also forced to slide across its rail.

This sliding requires a considerable force to make it happen, and the friction force resisting the sliding is designated &quot;L&quot;, the lateral force. The wheelset applies a force L outwards to the rails, and the rails apply a force L inwards to the wheels. Note that this is quite independent of &quot;centrifugal force&quot;. However at higher speeds the centrifugal force is added to the friction force to make L.

The load (vertical force) on the outer wheel is designated V, so that in Diagram 4 the two forces L and V are shown.

The steel-to-steel contact has a coefficient of friction that may be as high as 0.5 in dry conditions, so that the lateral force may be up to 0.5 of the vertical wheel load.

During this flange contact, the wheel on the high rail is experiencing the lateral force L, towards the outside of the curve. As the wheel rotates, the flange tends to climb up the flange angle. It is held down by the vertical load on the wheel V, so that if L/V exceeds the trigonometrical tangent of the flange contact angle, climbing will take place. The wheel flange will climb to the rail head where there is no lateral resistance in rolling movement, and a flange climbing derailment usually takes place. In Diagram 5 the flange contact angle is quite steep, and flange climbing is unlikely. However, if the rail head is side-worn (side-cut) or the flange is worn, as shown in Diagram 6 the contact angle is much flatter and flange climbing is more likely.

Once the wheel flange has completely climbed onto the rail head, there is no lateral restraint, and the wheelset is likely to follow the yaw angle, resulting in the wheel dropping outside the rail. An L/V ratio greater than 0.6 is considered to be hazardous.

It is emphasised that this is a much simplified description of the physics; complicating factors are creep, actual wheel and rail profiles, dynamic effects, stiffness of longitudinal restraint at axleboxes, and the lateral component of longitudinal (traction and braking) forces.

== Rerailing ==

Following a derailment, it is naturally necessary to replace the vehicle on the track. If there is no significant track damage, that may be all that is needed. However, when trains in normal running derail at speed, a considerable length of track may be damaged or destroyed; far worse secondary damage may be caused if a bridge is encountered.

With simple wagon derailments where the final position is close to the proper track location, it is usually possible to pull the derailed wheelsets back on to the track using rerailing ramps; these are metal blocks designed to fit over the rails and to provide a rising path back to the track. A locomotive is usually used to pull the wagon. A disadvantage of doing it this way is that the ramps can seriously damage the infrastructure. Because of which, this procedure may not be used in several countries.

If the derailed vehicle is further from the track, or its configuration (such as a high centre of gravity or a very short wheelbase) make the use of ramps impossible, jacks may be used. In its crudest form, the process involves lifting the vehicle frame and then allowing it to fall off the jack towards the track. This may need to be repeated.

A more sophisticated process involves a controlled process using slewing jacks in addition. 
This combination of lifting and sliding is called a hydraulic rerailing system. A system consisting of high pressure hydraulic lifting jacks (used for lifting the train) so a sliding system can be positioned underneath the vehicle. The sliding system consist of a beam (also called a bridge) with sleds or carriages which are moved laterally with a horizontally positioned high pressure hydraulic jack to push the vehicle back above track. After which it is lowered again on the track.

Photographs of early locomotives often indicate one or more jacks carried on the frame of the locomotive for the purpose, presumed to be a frequent occurrence.

When more complex rerailing work is needed, various combinations of cable and pulley systems may be used, or the use of one or more rail-borne cranes to lift a locomotive bodily. In special cases road cranes are used, as these have greater lifting and reach capacity, if road access to the site is feasible.

In extreme circumstances, a derailed vehicle in an awkward location may be scrapped and cut up on site, or simply abandoned as non-salvageable.

== Examples ==
&quot;Note: there is a large list of railway accidents in general at Lists of rail accidents.&quot;

=== Primary mechanical failure of a track component ===
In the Hatfield rail crash in England in 2000, which killed four people, rolling contact fatigue had resulted in multiple gauge corner cracking in the surface; 300 such cracks were subsequently found at the site. The rail cracked under a high speed passenger train, which derailed.

In the earlier Hither Green rail crash, a triangular segment of rail at a joint became displaced, and lodged in the joint; it derailed a passenger train and 49 persons died. Poor maintenance on an intensively operated section of route was the cause.

=== Primary mechanical failure of a component of the running gear of a vehicle ===
In the Eschede train disaster in Germany, a high speed passenger train derailed in 1998, killing 101 people. The primary cause was the fracture from metal fatigue of a wheel tyre; the train failed to negotiate two sets of points and struck the pier of an overbridge. It was the most serious railway accident in Germany, and also the most serious on any high speed (over ) line. Ultrasonic testing had failed to reveal the incipient fracture.

=== Dynamic effects of vehicle–track interaction ===
In 1967 in the UK there were four derailments due to buckling of continuously welded track (&quot;CWR&quot;): at Lichfield on 10 June, an empty carflat train (a train of flat cars for transporting automobiles); on 13 June an express passenger train was derailed at Somerton; on 15 July a freightliner train (container train) was derailed at Lamington; and on 23 July an express passenger train was derailed at Sandy. The official report was not entirely conclusive as to the causes, but it observed that the annual total of buckling distortions was 48 in 1969, having been in single figures in every previous year, and that [heat-related] distortions per 1,000 miles per annum were 10.42 for CWR and 2.98 for jointed track in 1969, having been a maximum of 1.78 and 1.21 in the previous ten years. 90% of the distortions could be attributed to one of the following:
* failure to comply with the instructions for laying or maintaining CWR track
* recent interference with the consolidation of the ballast
* the effect of discontinuities in the CWR track such as points etc.
* extraneous factors such as formation subsidence.

=== Improper operation of control systems ===

In the Connington South rail crash on 5 March 1967 in England, a signaller moved the points immediately in front of an approaching train. Mechanical signalling was in force at the location, and it was believed that he improperly replaced the signal protecting the points to danger just as the locomotive passed it. This released the locking on the points and he moved them to lead to a loop line with a low speed restriction. The train, travelling at , was unable to negotiate the points in that position and five people died.

=== Secondary events following collision ===
A passenger train was derailed in the Polmont rail accident in the UK in 1984 upon hitting a cow at speed; the train formation had the locomotive at the rear (propelling) with a light driving-trailer vehicle leading. The cow had strayed on to the line from adjacent agricultural land, due to deficient fencing. 13 persons died in the resulting derailment. However this was thought to be the first occurrence from this cause (in the UK) since 1948.

=== Train handling effects ===
The Salisbury rail crash took place on 1 July 1906; a first class only special boat train from Stonehousepool, Plymouth England, ran through Salisbury station at about ; there was a sharp curve of ten chains (660 feet, 200 m) radius and a speed restriction to . The locomotive overturned bodily and struck the vehicles of a milk train on the adjacent line. 28 people were killed. The driver was sober and normally reliable, but had not driven a non-stopping train through Salisbury before.

There have been several other derailments in the UK due to trains entering speed-restricted sections of track at excessive speed; the causes have generally been inattention by the driver due to alcohol, fatigue or other causes. Prominent cases were the Nuneaton rail crash in 1975 (temporary speed restriction in force due to trackwork, warning sign illumination failed), the Morpeth accident in 1984 (express passenger sleeping car train took restricted sharp curve at full speed; alcohol a factor; no fatalities due to the improved crashworthiness of the vehicles)

<text>Wardell Baxter Pomeroy (December 6, 1913 – September 6, 2001) was an American sexologist. He was a frequent co-author with Alfred C. Kinsey.

==Biography==
Pomeroy was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the son of Percy W. and Mary A. Pomeroy. He graduated from Indiana University (BA, 1935; MA, 1942) and earned a Ph.D. in psychology in 1954 from Columbia University. While working as a psychologist in an Indiana state hospital, he met Kinsey and came to work on his seminal sex-research project. Pomeroy personally recorded approximately 6,000 sexual histories. He was co-author with Kinsey on the landmark books &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; (1948) and &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; (1953). He went into the private practice of sex therapy in New York City in 1963 and wrote books about adolescent sexuality for popular consumption. In 1976, he became dean of the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality and an adjunct professor at California Medical School and California State University at Northridge. In 1978 he was on the board of advisors for Rupert Raj&#x27;s Foundation for The Advancement of Canadian Transsexuals (F.A.C.T.) Pomeroy retired due to declining health in 1983 and died in Bloomington, Indiana of Lewy body dementia.

Pomeroy was portrayed in the 2004 theatrical film &quot;Kinsey&quot; by Chris O&#x27;Donnell.

<doc id="1093604" wikidata="Q381148" url="?curid=1093604" title="International humanitarian law">
<text>International humanitarian law (IHL), also referred to as the laws of armed conflict, is the law that regulates the conduct of war (&quot;&quot;). It is a branch of international law that seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict by protecting persons who are not participating in hostilities and by restricting and regulating the means and methods of warfare available to combatants.

International humanitarian law is inspired by considerations of humanity and the mitigation of human suffering. It comprises a set of rules, which is established by treaty or custom and that seeks to protect persons and property/objects that are or may be affected by armed conflict, and it limits the rights of parties to a conflict to use methods and means of warfare of their choice. Sources of international law include international agreements (the Geneva Conventions), customary international law, general principles of nations, and case law. It defines the conduct and responsibilities of belligerent nations, neutral nations, and individuals engaged in warfare, in relation to each other and to &quot;protected persons&quot;, usually meaning non-combatants. It is designed to balance humanitarian concerns and military necessity, and subjects warfare to the rule of law by limiting its destructive effect and alleviating human suffering. Serious violations of international humanitarian law are called war crimes. 

While IHL (&quot;jus in bello&quot;) concerns the rules and principles governing the conduct of warfare once armed conflict has begun, &quot;jus ad bellum&quot; pertains to the justification for resorting to war and includes the crime of aggression. Together the &quot;jus in bello&quot; and &quot;jus ad bellum&quot; comprise the two strands of the laws of war governing all aspects of international armed conflicts. The law is mandatory for nations bound by the appropriate treaties. There are also other customary unwritten rules of war, many of which were explored at the Nuremberg trials. IHL operates on a strict division between rules applicable in international armed conflict and internal armed conflict.

International humanitarian law is traditionally seen as distinct from international human rights law (which governs the conduct of a state towards its people), although the two branches of law are complementary and in some ways overlap. 

== The law of Geneva and the law of The Hague ==

Modern international humanitarian law is made up of two historical streams:

# The law of The Hague, referred to in the past as the law of war proper; and
# The law of Geneva, or humanitarian law.

The two streams take their names from a number of international conferences that took place in those two cities and which produced treaties relating to war and conflict, in particular the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and the Geneva Conventions, the first of which was drawn up in 1863. Both deal with , which deals with the question of whether certain practices are acceptable during armed conflict.

The Law of The Hague, or the laws of war proper, &quot;determines the rights and duties of belligerents in the conduct of operations and limits the choice of means in doing harm&quot;. In particular, it concerns itself with:

* the definition of combatants;
* establishes rules relating to the means and methods of warfare; and
* examines the issue of military objectives.

Systematic attempts to limit the savagery of warfare only began to develop in the 19th century. Such concerns were able to build on the changing view of warfare by states influenced by the Age of Enlightenment. The purpose of warfare was to overcome the enemy state, which could be done by disabling the enemy combatants. Thus, &quot;the distinction between combatants and civilians, the requirement that wounded and captured enemy combatants must be treated humanely, and that quarter must be given, some of the pillars of modern humanitarian law, all follow from this principle&quot;.

== The law of Geneva ==
Fritz Munch sums up historical military practice before 1800: &quot;The essential points seem to be these: In battle and in towns taken by force, combatants and non-combatants were killed and property was destroyed or looted.&quot; In the 17th century, the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, widely regarded as the founder or father of public international law, wrote that &quot;wars, for the attainment of their objects, it cannot be denied, must employ force and terror as their most proper agents&quot;.

=== Humanitarian norms in history ===
Even in the midst of the carnage of history, however, there have been frequent expressions and invocation of humanitarian norms for the protection of the victims of armed conflicts: the wounded, the sick and the shipwrecked. These date back to ancient times.

In the Old Testament, the King of Israel prevents the slaying of the captured, following the prophet Elisha&#x27;s admonition to spare enemy prisoners. In answer to a question from the King, Elisha said, &quot;You shall not slay them. Would you slay those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.&quot;

In ancient India there are records (the Laws of Manu, for example) describing the types of weapons that should not be used: &quot;When he fights with his foes in battle, let him not strike with weapons concealed (in wood), nor with (such as are) barbed, poisoned, or the points of which are blazing with fire.&quot; There is also the command not to strike a eunuch nor the enemy &quot;who folds his hands in supplication ... Nor one who sleeps, nor one who has lost his coat of mail, nor one who is naked, nor one who is disarmed, nor one who looks on without taking part in the fight.&quot;

Islamic law states that &quot;non-combatants who did not take part in fighting such as women, children, monks and hermits, the aged, blind, and insane&quot; were not to be molested. The first Caliph, Abu Bakr, proclaimed, &quot;Do not mutilate. Do not kill little children or old men or women. Do not cut off the heads of palm trees or burn them. Do not cut down fruit trees. Do not slaughter livestock except for food.&quot; Islamic jurists have held that a prisoner should not be killed, as he &quot;cannot be held responsible for mere acts of belligerency&quot;. 
However, the prohibition against killing non-combatants is not necessarily absolute in Islamic Law. For example, in situations where an &quot;enemy retreats inside fortifications and one-to-one combat is not an option&quot;, Islamic jurists have been unanimous as to the permissibility on the use of less discriminating weapons such as mangonels (a weapon for catapulting large stones) if required by military necessity but have differed with respect to the use of fire in such cases.

=== Codification of humanitarian norms ===
The most important antecedent of IHL is the current Armistice Agreement and Regularization of War, signed and ratified in 1820 between the authorities of the then Government of Great Colombia and the Chief of the Expeditionary Forces of the Spanish Crown, in the Venezuelan city of Santa Ana de Trujillo. This treaty was signed under the conflict of Independence, being the first of its kind in the West.

It was not until the second half of the 19th century, however, that a more systematic approach was initiated. In the United States, a German immigrant, Francis Lieber, drew up a code of conduct in 1863, which came to be known as the Lieber Code, for the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Lieber Code included the humane treatment of civilian populations in areas of conflict, and also forbade the execution of POWs.

At the same time, the involvement during the Crimean War of a number of such individuals as Florence Nightingale and Henry Dunant, a Genevese businessman who had worked with wounded soldiers at the Battle of Solferino, led to more systematic efforts to prevent the suffering of war victims. Dunant wrote a book, which he titled &quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot;, in which he described the horrors he had witnessed. His reports were so shocking that they led to the founding of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1863, and the convening of a conference in Geneva in 1864, which drew up the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. 
The Law of Geneva is directly inspired by the principle of humanity. It relates to those who are not participating in the conflict, as well as to military personnel . It provides the legal basis for protection and humanitarian assistance carried out by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the ICRC. This focus can be found in the Geneva Conventions.

== Geneva Conventions ==


The Geneva Conventions are the result of a process that developed in a number of stages between 1864 and 1949. It focused on the protection of civilians and those who can no longer fight in an armed conflict. As a result of World War II, all four conventions were revised, based on previous revisions and on some of the 1907 Hague Conventions, and readopted by the international community in 1949. Later conferences have added provisions prohibiting certain methods of warfare and addressing issues of civil wars.

The first three Geneva Conventions were revised, expanded, and replaced, and the fourth one was added, in 1949.

* The Geneva Convention &quot;for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field&quot; was adopted in 1864. It was significantly revised and replaced by the 1906 version, the 1929 version, and later the First Geneva Convention of 1949.
* The Geneva Convention &quot;for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea&quot; was adopted in 1906. It was significantly revised and replaced by the Second Geneva Convention of 1949.
* The Geneva Convention &quot;relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War&quot; was adopted in 1929. It was significantly revised and replaced by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949.
* The Fourth Geneva Convention &quot;relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War&quot; was adopted in 1949.

There are three additional amendment protocols to the Geneva Convention:

# Protocol I (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 167 countries.
# Protocol II (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 163 countries.
# Protocol III (2005): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem. As of June 2007 it had been ratified by seventeen countries and signed but not yet ratified by an additional 68.

The Geneva Conventions of 1949 may be seen, therefore, as the result of a process which began in 1864. Today they have &quot;achieved universal participation with 194 parties&quot;. This means that they apply to almost any international armed conflict. The Additional Protocols, however, have yet to achieve near-universal acceptance, since the United States and several other significant military powers (like Iran, Israel, India and Pakistan) are currently not parties to them.

== Historical convergence between IHL and the laws of war ==
With the adoption of the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, the two strains of law began to converge, although provisions focusing on humanity could already be found in the Hague law (i.e. the protection of certain prisoners of war and civilians in occupied territories). The 1977 Additional Protocols, relating to the protection of victims in both international and internal conflict, not only incorporated aspects of both the Law of The Hague and the Law of Geneva, but also important human rights provisions.

== Basic rules of IHL ==
# Protected persons are those &quot;hors de combat&quot; (outside of combat) or not taking part in hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, and shall be protected in all circumstances. Excluding from the list of protected persons in international armed conflict are civilians under their own national authority and neutral citizens living in belligerent territory and co-belligerent persons as long their state of nationality maintains diplomatic relations with a belligerent power.
# Protected persons who are wounded and sick shall be cared for and protected by the party to the conflict which has them in its power. The emblem of the &quot;Red Cross&quot;, or of the &quot;Red Crescent&quot;, or the &quot;Red Crystal&quot; shall be required to be respected as the sign of protection.
# Protected persons captured by a belligerent must be protected against acts of violence and reprisals. They shall have the right to correspond with their families and to receive relief.
# No protected person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.
# Parties to a conflict do not have an unlimited choice of methods and means of warfare.
# Parties to a conflict shall at all times distinguish between enemy combatants and protected persons. Attacks shall be directed solely against legitimate military targets.

===Examples===
Well-known examples of such rules include the prohibition on attacking doctors or ambulances displaying a red cross. It is also prohibited to fire at a person or vehicle bearing a white flag, since that, being considered the flag of truce, indicates an intent to surrender or a desire to communicate. In either case, the persons protected by the Red Cross or the white flag are expected to maintain neutrality, and may not engage in warlike acts themselves; engaging in war activities under a white flag or a red cross is itself a violation of the laws of war.

These examples of the laws of war address:
* declarations of war;
* acceptance of surrender;
* the treatment of prisoners of war;
* the avoidance of atrocities;
* the prohibition on deliberately attacking non-combatants; and
* the prohibition of certain inhumane weapons.

It is a violation of the laws of war to engage in combat without meeting certain requirements, among them the wearing of a distinctive uniform or other easily identifiable badge, and the carrying of weapons openly. Impersonating soldiers of the other side by wearing the enemy&#x27;s uniform is allowed, though fighting in that uniform is unlawful perfidy, as is the taking of hostages.

== Later additions ==
International humanitarian law now includes several treaties that outlaw specific weapons. These conventions were created largely because these weapons cause deaths and injuries long after conflicts have ended. Unexploded land mines have caused up to 7,000 deaths a year; unexploded bombs, particularly from cluster bombs that scatter many small &quot;bomblets&quot;, have also killed many. An estimated 98% of the victims are civilian; farmers tilling their fields and children who find these explosives have been common victims. For these reasons, the following conventions have been adopted:

* The Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (1980), which prohibits weapons that produce non-detectable fragments, restricts (but does not eliminate) the use of mines and booby-traps, prohibits attacking civilians with incendiary weapons, prohibits blinding laser weapons, and requires the warring parties to clear unexploded ordnance at the end of hostilities;
* The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (1997), also called the Ottawa Treaty or the Mine Ban Treaty, which completely bans the stockpiling (except to a limited degree, for training purposes) and use of all anti-personnel land mines;
* The Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (2000), an amendment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), which forbids the enlistment of anyone under the age of eighteen for armed conflict; and
* The Convention on Cluster Munitions (2008), which prohibits the use of bombs that scatter bomblets, many of which do not explode and remain dangerous long after a conflict has ended.

== International Committee of the Red Cross ==

The ICRC is the only institution explicitly named under international humanitarian law as a controlling authority. The legal mandate of the ICRC stems from the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, as well as from its own Statutes.

== Violations and punishment ==
During conflict, punishment for violating the laws of war may consist of a specific, deliberate and limited violation of the laws of war in reprisal.

Combatants who break specific provisions of the laws of war lose the protections and status afforded to them as prisoners of war, but only after facing a &quot;competent tribunal&quot;. At that point, they become unlawful combatants, but must still be &quot;treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial&quot;, because they are still covered by GC IV, Article 5.

Spies and terrorists are only protected by the laws of war if the &quot;power&quot; which holds them is in a state of armed conflict or war, and until they are found to be an &quot;unlawful combatant&quot;. Depending on the circumstances, they may be subject to civilian law or a military tribunal for their acts. In practice, they have often have been subjected to torture and execution. The laws of war neither approve nor condemn such acts, which fall outside their scope. Spies may only be punished following a trial; if captured after rejoining their own army, they must be treated as prisoners of war. Suspected terrorists who are captured during an armed conflict, without having participated in the hostilities, may be detained only in accordance with the GC IV, and are entitled to a regular trial. Countries that have signed the &quot;UN Convention Against Torture&quot; have committed themselves not to use torture on anyone for any reason.

After a conflict has ended, persons who have committed any breach of the laws of war, and especially atrocities, may be held individually accountable for war crimes through process of law.

Reparation for victims of serious violations of International Humanitarian Law acknowledges the suffering endured by individuals and communities and seeks to provide a form of redress for the harms inflicted upon them. The evolving legal landscape, notably through the mechanisms of international courts like the ICC, has reinforced the notion that victims of war crimes and other serious breaches of International Humanitarian Law have a recognized right to seek reparations. These reparations can take various forms, including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition, aimed at addressing the physical, psychological, and material damage suffered by victims.

== Key provisions and principles applicable to civilians ==
The Fourth Geneva Convention focuses on the civilian population. The two additional protocols adopted in 1977 extend and strengthen civilian protection in international (AP I) and non-international (AP II) armed conflict: for example, by introducing the prohibition of direct attacks against civilians. A &quot;civilian&quot; is defined as &quot;any person not belonging to the armed forces&quot;, including non-nationals and refugees. However, it is accepted that operations may cause civilian casualties. Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, wrote in 2006: &quot;International humanitarian law and the Rome statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives, even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) ... or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality).&quot;

The provisions and principles of IHL which seek to protect civilians are:

=== IHL provisions and principles protecting civilians ===

==== Principle of distinction ====
The principle of distinction protects civilian population and civilian objects from the effects of military operations. It requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish at all times, and under all circumstances, between combatants and military objectives on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other; and only to target the former. It also provides that civilians lose such protection should they take a direct part in hostilities. The principle of distinction has also been found by the ICRC to be reflected in state practice; it is therefore an established norm of customary international law in both international and non-international armed conflicts.

==== Necessity and proportionality ====
Necessity and proportionality are established principles in humanitarian law. Under IHL, a belligerent may apply only the amount and kind of force necessary to defeat the enemy. Further, attacks on military objects must not cause loss of civilian life considered excessive in relation to the direct military advantage anticipated. Every feasible precaution must be taken by commanders to avoid civilian casualties. The principle of proportionality has also been found by the ICRC to form part of customary international law in international and non-international armed conflicts.

==== Principle of humane treatment ====
The principle of humane treatment requires that civilians be treated humanely at all times. Common Article 3 of the GCs prohibits violence to life and person (including cruel treatment and torture), the taking of hostages, humiliating and degrading treatment, and execution without regular trial against non-combatants, including persons &quot;hors de combat&quot; (wounded, sick and shipwrecked). Civilians are entitled to respect for their physical and mental integrity, their honour, family rights, religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. This principle of humane treatment has been affirmed by the ICRC as a norm of customary international law, applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts.

==== Principle of non-discrimination ====
The principle of non-discrimination is a core principle of IHL. Adverse distinction based on race, sex, nationality, religious belief or political opinion is prohibited in the treatment of prisoners of war, civilians, and persons &quot;hors de combat&quot;. All protected persons shall be treated with the same consideration by parties to the conflict, without distinction based on race, religion, sex or political opinion. Each and every person affected by armed conflict is entitled to his fundamental rights and guarantees, without discrimination. The prohibition against adverse distinction is also considered by the ICRC to form part of customary international law in international and non-international armed conflict.

==== Women and children ====
Women must be protected from rape, forced prostitution and from any form of indecent assault. Children under the age of eighteen must not be permitted to take part in hostilities, cannot be evacuated to a foreign country by a country other than theirs, except temporarily due to a compelling threat to their health and safety, and if orphaned or separated from their families, must be maintained and receive an education.

==== Resolution 2664 ====
The European Union has made significant changes to its sanctions policy to better safeguard humanitarian efforts, in response to the United Nations Security Council resolution 2664 (2022). This includes incorporating humanitarian exemptions into EU sanctions regimes, ensuring that aid can reach those in need without legal barriers. This shift has led to the inclusion of comprehensive humanitarian exemptions in new sanctions frameworks for Niger and Sudan, and the amendment of existing regimes to incorporate similar exemptions, thereby covering key humanitarian contexts in countries like Lebanon, Myanmar, and Venezuela.

== Sex and culture ==
=== Sex ===
IHL emphasises, in various provisions in the GCs and APs, the concept of formal equality and non-discrimination. Protections should be provided &quot;without any adverse distinction founded on sex&quot;. For example, with regard to female prisoners of war, women are required to receive treatment &quot;as favourable as that granted to men&quot;. In addition to claims of formal equality, IHL mandates special protections to women, providing female prisoners of war with separate dormitories from men, for example, and prohibiting sexual violence against women.

The reality of women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s lived experiences of conflict has highlighted some of the gender limitations of IHL. Feminist critics have challenged IHL&#x27;s focus on male combatants and its relegation of women to the status of victims, and its granting them legitimacy almost exclusively as child-rearers. A study of the 42 provisions relating to women within the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols found that almost half address women who are expectant or nursing mothers. Others have argued that the issue of sexual violence against men in conflict has not yet received the attention it deserves.

Soft-law instruments have been relied on to supplement the protection of women in armed conflict:

* UN Security Council Resolutions 1888 and 1889 (2009), which aim to enhance the protection of women and children against sexual violations in armed conflict; and
* Resolution 1325, which aims to improve the participation of women in post-conflict peacebuilding.

Read together with other legal mechanisms, in particular the UN Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), these can enhance interpretation and implementation of IHL.

In addition, international criminal tribunals (like the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda) and mixed tribunals (like the Special Court for Sierra Leone) have contributed to expanding the scope of definitions of sexual violence and rape in conflict. They have effectively prosecuted sexual and gender-based crimes committed during armed conflict. There is now well-established jurisprudence on gender-based crimes. Nonetheless, there remains an urgent need to further develop constructions of gender within international humanitarian law.

=== Culture===
IHL has generally not been subject to the same debates and criticisms of &quot;cultural relativism&quot; as have international human rights. Although the modern codification of IHL in the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocols is relatively new, and European in name, the core concepts are not new, and laws relating to warfare can be found in all cultures. Indeed, non-Western participants played important roles in the development of this area of law at the global level as early as the 1907 Second Hague Conference, and have continued to do so since.

ICRC studies on the Middle East, Somalia, Latin America, and the Pacific, for example have found that there are traditional and long-standing practices in various cultures that preceded, but are generally consistent with, modern IHL. It is important to respect local and cultural practices that are in line with IHL. Relying on these links and on local practices can help to promote awareness of and adherence to IHL principles among local groups and communities.

Durham cautions that, although traditional practices and IHL legal norms are largely compatible, it is important not to assume perfect alignment. There are areas in which legal norms and cultural practices clash. Violence against women, for example, is frequently legitimized by arguments from culture, and yet is prohibited in IHL and other international law. In such cases, it is important to ensure that IHL is not negatively affected.

<text>Princess Knight, also known as Ribon no Kishi, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Tezuka. This manga follows the adventures of Sapphire, a girl who was born accidentally with a blue heart of a boy and a pink heart of a girl. She pretends to be a prince to prevent the evil Duke Duralumin from taking over the kingdom through his son, Plastic. The gender-bending main character was inspired by the all-female musical theater group Takarazuka Revue in which women performed both female and male roles.

The story was ordered by an editor of Kodansha&#x27;s magazine &quot;Shōjo Club&quot; who wanted Tezuka to produce a manga aimed towards a female audience that could replicate the success of his former boy-aimed stories. The author then created &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, originally serialized in that magazine from 1953 to 1956. The manga&#x27;s popularity resulted into a radio dramatization in 1955, three other serializations between 1958 and 1968, and a 52-episode television anime series by Mushi Production that aired on Fuji TV from 1967 to 1968. It has also influenced several stage musicals since the 1980s and inspired remakes of the work by other authors.

The series&#x27; arrival in the English-speaking market was delayed by NBC Enterprises executives&#x27; perception that it could be interpreted as &quot;sex switch&quot;. However, still in the 1970s, the television series got a dubbed version produced by Joe Oriolo. Renamed &quot;Choppy and the Princess&quot;, it was released to American, Australian, and British television audiences, with home video releases to follow. The manga would only reach the anglophone public years later, in 2001 when Kodansha International published a bilingual edition of &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, which was followed by a newer version by Vertical in 2011.

One of Tezuka&#x27;s most famous works and widely regarded as a classic, &quot;Princess Knight&quot; has been very influential in the manga and anime industry. Its portrayal of gender roles is ambiguously interpreted by critics; some claim it has pro-feminist ideals and others think it expresses misogynist ideals of the 1950s–60s Japanese society. Nonetheless, it would start a tradition of androgynous-like heroines and establish several trends in the &quot;shōjo&quot; genre. In fact, it is considered to be one of the first works in this genre that was narrative-focused and that portrays a female superhero.

==Plot==
Taking place in a medieval European-like fairy tale setting, &quot;Princess Knight&quot; is the story of Sapphire, who must pretend to be a male prince, so she can inherit the throne of Silverland as women are not eligible to do so. When she is born, her father, the King, announces his baby is a boy instead of a girl. The reason for this is that the next-in-line to the throne, Duke Duralumin, is an evil man who would repress the people if his son, Plastic, were to become king. Duralumin and his henchman Baron Nylon often scheme to take over the kingdom and attempts to prove that Sapphire is really a girl. Sapphire can keep the façade because, when she was born, she received the blue heart of a boy as well as the pink heart of a girl. Because of this, God sent Tink, a young angel-in-training, down to Earth to retrieve Sapphire&#x27;s extra heart. Sapphire would not let Tink remove her boy&#x27;s heart, however.

Sapphire and Tink experience a variety of adventures, including encounters with Satan, a warlock who wants to steal Sapphire&#x27;s special two-hearted soul and take over the kingdom. However, he is always frustrated by Tink and his fear of angels, and by his own daughter, Hecate, a demonic-shapeshifting witch who at first she appears to be evil like her father, but who covertly helps Sapphire foil her father&#x27;s plans. Sapphire also dons a Zorro-style mask at night, fighting crime as the Phantom Knight, and gets involved with Franz Charming, the young prince of neighboring Goldland. Their relationship is multi-faceted; Franz is familiar with Sapphire as three entirely different people and has different feelings toward each. He is good friends with Prince Sapphire, in love with the unnamed princess, and despises the Phantom Knight, whom he believes is a rival for the Princess&#x27;s affection.

As the story progresses, Duralumin stages a coup d&#x27;état to conquer Silverland, following the orders of Mr. X, a large man clad entirely in boxy red armor and the ruler of the X-Union, a neighboring, proto-fascist federation of nations that wants to conquer the three kingdoms (Silverland, Goldland, and Charcoal-land). The King and Queen are captured, but help Sapphire to flee. Duralumin is about to proclaim his son king and himself as regent when he is assassinated by Nylon, who has been driven near-insane by the Duke&#x27;s constant abuse. The mentally deranged Nylon proclaims himself and welcomes Mr. X and his armies to Silverland. Mr. X, though, soon makes it clear that he has no intention of letting Nylon rule, even as a puppet monarch, and merely keeps him around as a churlish buffoon.

Sapphire and Franz try to prevent the King and Queen from being executed, but they are too late and the King and Queen are dropped in the sea. This culminates in the final battle, as Sapphire heads off to Silverland castle to confront Mr. X with the aid of three magic balls. Given to Sapphire by her parents, the balls represent the three kingdoms and are supposed to save Silverland: they are used at first to ring the kingdom&#x27;s bells, magically giving to the people the will to fight the invaders.

Sapphire has the balls melted to form a magic axe, which she uses to rout Mr. X&#x27;s troops, break up the castle&#x27;s walls, and confront X himself. Sapphire ends up dueling Mr. X, with the help of Franz, and manages to wound him. Just as the enraged Mr. X is about to chop Sapphire and Franz in half, Tink calls on God for help, and a lightning bolt strikes X. As Sapphire seems to triumph, Mr. X rises from his apparent death and begins smashing the castle with his bare hands, eventually causing it to collapse onto himself. Nylon, who was swaying through the halls like a raving madman, is also crushed to death. Sapphire escapes the collapsing castle and stands triumphant in the sunlight. Tink has been mortally wounded by the castle&#x27;s breakdown, and tells God that he is ready to sacrifice his life should Sapphire&#x27;s parents be brought back from the dead. God then accepts to bring back the King and Queen to life, as Tink dies.

Sapphire and Franz end up getting married. Tink&#x27;s spirit returns to heaven, where he has finally earns his wings.

==Production and style==

During the 1950s, Osamu Tezuka was already popular having written &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot; (1950) and &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (1952). In late 1952, a &quot;Shōjo Club&quot;″s editor asked Tezuka if he would be able to create a work similar to his previous ones but aimed toward girls. Tezuka agreed and his first idea was to transpose the all-female musical theater group Takarazuka Revue into manga. Takarazuka&#x27;s &quot;aesthetic is on full display in &quot;Princess Knight&quot;&quot;, argued Natsu Onoda Power, in her book &quot;God of Comics&quot;.

Born in Osaka, Tezuka lived in Takarazuka City between five and twenty-four, and with a mother who was fan of the revue, he often watched its performances during his childhood and youthhood. Takarazuka&#x27;s costumes, sets, and lyrics, as well as its gender representation and sexual politics were used by Tezuka on creating &quot;Princess Knight&quot;. Sapphire is based on the &quot;dansō no reijin&quot; (&quot;beauty in male dress&quot;) of Takarazuka, and Franz is modeled after one of the main actresses, Yachiyo Kasugano. Nobuko Otowa as Puck in Takarazuka&#x27;s version of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; influenced Tink&#x27;s character.

Early Disney films&#x27; animation technique influenced Tezuka&#x27;s art style, especially his way of drawing childlike features and eyes. The very large eyes were also inspired by Takarazuka&#x27;s performances. The coloring and layout was influenced by the film &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;. Some aspects of &quot;Princess Knight&quot; are also reminiscent of his previous &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, &quot;Kiseki no Mori no Monogatari&quot;, which featured a feathered hat and men in white maillots as well as adventure-driven storylines. It was also influenced by Western literature, Christianity, Greek mythology, and European fairy tales—because of this it has been described as a &quot;trippy pop culture pastiche&quot;. Reviewers have perceived influences from &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot;″s &quot;Pastoral&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Snow White&quot;, Betty Boop, &quot;Captain Blood&quot;, &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Eros and Psyche&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, and William Tell.

==Themes==
Multiple critics have provided many possible interpretations on the presence of gender ambiguity and androgyny on &quot;Princess Knight&quot;. Patrick Drazen, author of the book &quot;Anime Explosion!&quot;, stated the androgyny in the series is &quot;deceptive&quot; as it addresses gender instead of sex, and more &quot;specifically, gender-role expectations.&quot; &quot;Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Gekiga&quot;: Behind the Mask of Manga&quot;″s Philip Brophy summed up it as: &quot;With its visualization of masculinity and femininity within one body it was able to depict conflicting selves within one-sexed body under pressure for social conformity, hence literally embodying the quest for identity and subjective agency&quot;. Ed Sizemore of Manga Worth Reading says Tezuka&#x27;s central idea critiques &quot;the false dichotomy that society creates among male and female.&quot; Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network (ANN) and Sheena McNeil of Sequential Tart both wrote that Tezuka put feminist positionings on it and Chris Mautner of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; highlighted the presence of Friebe, &quot;a swashbuckling&quot; swordswoman, as another depiction of women in a non-subservient position (in contrast to the usual depiction).
On the other hand, Silverman affirmed it shows gender stereotypes and &quot;some of the more misogynist ideals of 1960s Japan,&quot; as exemplified by the fact her boy&#x27;s heart gives her physical strength. Mautner also found &quot;some&quot; sexism in the work, given as an example the fact she loses her swordsmanship ability when she is without her boy&#x27;s heart. Drazen and Mautner stressed that the manga had broken with some gender expectations but did not abandon them, as Sapphire marries Franz in the end. Power stated that by this attitude Sapphire shows &quot;her true happiness comes from being in a traditional female role.&quot; For Paul Gravett, it demonstrated she &quot;was no feminist rebel after all&quot; and he wrote in &quot;Manga: Sixty Years of Japanese Comics&quot; that Tezuka &quot;created an exquisite world of indecision.&quot; Power concluded that &quot;The image of Sapphire must have sent complex, if not conflicting, messages&quot; to readers. This conflicts led Brophy to say &quot;It may be more accurate to depict her characterization as schizophrenic rather than androgynous&quot;.

Snow Wildsmith of ICv2 described the series as having &quot;younger characters [who] do not want to stick to the roles their parents proscribed for them and most of the women are tired of being told that they are the lesser sex.&quot; Mautner wrote that &quot;if there&#x27;s a central theme in &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, however, it&#x27;s not that of sex roles but of parental expectations and filial duty&quot;. Drazen also exposed that the series deals with &quot;another classically Japanese pair of opposites: duty and desire.&quot; Drazen said &quot;she doesn&#x27;t resent her duty&quot; of having to be a boy and have fun with it, but that &quot;only in private does she live out her feminine desires.&quot; Mautner expressed a similar view, affirming that even if she likes to be a boy &quot;possesses a strong desire to indulge her female side.&quot;

==Publication==
There have been four manga serializations of &quot;Princess Knight&quot; in Japan. The first serialization ran from January 1953 to January 1956 in Kodansha&#x27;s magazine &quot;Shōjo Club&quot;, and was followed by a three &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes release between December 30, 1954 and June 25, 1958. It was followed by several reissues; two volumes were published on October 11, and November 13, 1979 under the Osamu Tezuka Manga Complete Works line; on April 17, 1995 under KC Grand Collection line, and on November 12, 1999 under Manga Bunko line. In 2004, Geneon Universal Entertainment released a &quot;kanzenban&quot; edition of the manga that was republished by Fukkan.com in 2012. It was also released in a three-volume edition on January 13, 2009, followed by a &quot;Special Box&quot; on January 14, 2009, and in an Osamu Tezuka Bunko Complete Works edition on February 10, 2011.

The second serialization, a follow-up to the &quot;Shōjo Club&quot; version, ran in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from January 1958 to June 1958. The title was changed to for publication in book form, but the serialization&#x27;s name was still &quot;Princess Knight&quot;. It was first compiled by Suzuka Shuppan and released in a single &quot;tankōbon&quot; on May 15, 1960, which was republished by Mushi Pro Shōji on July 15, 1971. Kodansha published it in different lines and formats; on July 28, 1978 under the Osamu Tezuka Manga Complete Works line; on June 4, 1995 under the KC Grand Collection line; on November 12, 1999 under the Manga Bunko line; and on May 12, 2010 under the Osamu Tezuka Bunko Complete Works line.

The third serialization was a rewriting of the &quot;Shōjo Club&quot; version and ran from January 1963 to October 1966 in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;, and was originally published into five &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Kodansha between August 15, 1964 and June 15, 1966. It was followed by several rereleases and reissues; three volumes were published by Shogakukan in pocketbook format between March 10, and May 10, 1969; three volumes were published between June 13, 1977 and January 11, 1978 under the Osamu Tezuka Manga Complete Works line by Kodansha; in June 1982 it was published by Holp Shuppan; on December 14, 1994 it was released under KC Grand Collection line; on October 9, 1999 under Manga Bunko Line; and on October 9, 2009 under the Osamu Tezuka Bunko Complete Works line. A Kanzen Fukkoku-ban edition, along with a &quot;Special Box&quot;, was published on May 29, 2009.

The fourth serialization was a science fiction story originally written by Tezuka, with the drawings done by Kitano Hideaki. It was serialized in the magazine &quot;Shōjo Friend&quot; in 1967, concurrently with its broadcast on television as animation. Kodansha encapsulated its chapters into two volumes released on May 3, 1967, and June 3, 1967. A tie-in to the anime series, Tezuka himself admitted that it was &quot;a commercial flop, an ill-conceived&quot; version.

Six volumes of &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;″s 1963 &quot;Princess Knight&quot; were released between May 18, and July 27, 2001 in the United States in a bilingual (English/Japanese) edition by Kodansha International. A preview of the 1953 manga was released in the July 2007 issue of Viz Media&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Shojo Beat&quot;. At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Vertical announced that it had licensed the 1963 version for an English-language translation in North America. Vertical published it in two parts; the first on November 1, 2011, and the second on December 6, 2011. In the following year, Vertical licensed &quot;The Twin Knights&quot;, which was released on July 30, 2013. Both series were rereleased by Vertical in ebook format; first, &quot;The Twin Knights&quot; on July 22, 2015, and then both &quot;Princess Knight&quot; volumes on August 12, 2015.

==Anime adaptation==

The &quot;Princess Knight&quot; anime series was produced by Mushi Production and had Osamu Tezuka as executive director, and Chikao Katsui and Kanji Akabori as chief directors. The series of 52 episodes was originally broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV from April 2, 1967 to April 7, 1968. In addition to the anime series, there is also 28-minute pilot film that was produced in November 1966 but was not broadcast on television. It was released as an extra when the series was released on LaserDisc in Japan. All episodes were released on LaserDisc by Pioneer on March 28, 1997. The episodes were also distributed in DVD format; Nippon Columbia released two box sets on December 21, 2001 and June 1, 2002. A single box set was released by Columbia on July 23, 2008, and another was released by Takarashijima on October 29, 2010. A &quot;Best Selection&quot; DVD series was first released by Columbia on September 25, 2003, and rereleased on July 23, 2008.

Mushi Production submitted the anime adaptation to NBC Enterprises that was declined because its executives felt the series theme could be interpreted as &quot;sex switch.&quot; Animator Joe Oriolo, however, purchased the anime&#x27;s distribution rights, and along with Burt Hecht dubbed its episodes into English. In 1972, after a limited release under the title &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, Oriolo and Hecht edited three episodes and made it into a film titled &quot;Choppy and the Princess&quot; that was licensed to independent television in the United States and was syndicated in the 1970s and 1980s. In October 2012, Nozomi Entertainment, a Right Stuf&#x27;s publishing division, acquired its distribution&#x27;s rights for North America. Featuring an English-language and a Spanish-language dub, it used the edited and cut version broadcast in the 1970s and 1980s. The first part was released on August 20, 2013 while the second one was published on October 22, 2013.

The show also aired in Australia in the 1970s, and was released on home media in Australia and the United Kingdom. Movie Makers released seven episodes under the title &quot;The Adventures of Choppy and the Princess&quot; and three individual episodes without the title. The distributor Tasley Leisures released six episodes under the title &quot;Choppy and the Princess, Adventures 1-6&quot;. The Starlite Group released seven &quot;The Adventures of Choppy and the Princess&quot; DVDs in the United Kingdom in 2006, with the film also being available from the same company. In August 2013, Hanabee Entertainment licensed the series for an Australian release; it was first released on DVD into two parts on September 18, and October 6, 2013 respectively, while a box set was released on September 6, 2014.

===Theater===
At various times in his career, Tezuka worked on short original animation films, or &quot;theater anime&quot;, which included some of the &quot;Princess Knight&quot; story. Samples of this work were shown in the &quot;300 Inch Theater&quot;, which was held at Tezuka Osamu World in the Kyoto Station Building from July 1999. In this film, the Phoenix (from the eponymous Tezuka manga) plays the role of storyteller, and introduces two pictures. The first part tells the story of &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, and the second part talks about Minamoto Yoshitsune, who made his mark in the history of Kyoto as a person who became entangled in a struggle by another&#x27;s wicked design in spite of his desire for peace just like Sapphire.

==Reception==
Widely considered a classic, &quot;Princess Knight&quot; was very popular with girls in Japan by the time of its original release. One of the author&#x27;s most popular works in Japan, it has been labeled as &quot;a fascinating piece of anime history ... that&#x27;s withstood the test of time&quot; by Bamboo Dong of ANN. In 2005, Japanese television network TV Asahi conducted a &quot;Top 100&quot; online web poll and nationwide survey; &quot;Princess Knight&quot; placed 74th in the online poll and 71st in the survey. In 2006, TV Asahi conducted another online poll for the top one hundred anime, and &quot;Princess Knight&quot; did not make the general list, but ranked 77th in the &quot;Celebrity List&quot;. After Vertical&#x27;s statement that it would publish &quot;Princess Knight&quot;, critics Chris Butcher and Deb Aoki deemed it as one of the most anticipated manga announced at Comic-Con. In the following year, it was considered one of the best new &quot;kids/teen&quot; manga by critics Carlo Santos and Shaenon Garrity at Comic-Con. Aoki, for About.com, selected it as the second best new &quot;shōjo&quot; released in 2011 after &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, stating it &quot;can seem a little dated and quaint compared to its contemporary counterparts, but it&#x27;s no less charming and fun to read.&quot; Gravett included &quot;Princess Knight&quot; on his book &quot;1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die&quot;.

Its art has been well received by critics, including Sizemore, Joseph Luster of &quot;Otaku USA&quot;, Wildsmith, Chris Kirby of The Fandom Post, and by Mautner, who stated, &quot;Visually, &quot;Knight&quot; is a stunning achievement.&quot; On the other hand, Carlo Santos and Silverman of ANN said its art style may not appeal to modern readers, with Silverman deeming it a great &quot;deterrent&quot;. Kirby wrote that &quot;Princess Knight&quot; is &quot;a pleasure to look at, fun to read, and a piece of entertainment that excels at entertaining more than anything.&quot; Sizemore praised it as it &quot;constantly delivering thrills at each turn,&quot; contrasting to Wildsmith, who considered the episodic nature of the series &quot;chaotic and unfocused&quot;. Although also commended the formula, Santos stated the story in overall &quot;has its weaknesses&quot; and &quot;allows itself ... logical loopholes.&quot; Luster asserted initially it focused too much in gags which &quot;could easily become a tiresome formula&quot;, but the action in late chapters overcomes it. Sizemore called it &quot;fun&quot; but &quot;deeply flawed in its storytelling.&quot; Shaun A. Noordin of &quot;The Star&quot; asserted, &quot;The memorable characters, adventure, drama and comedy (not to mention a framework for exploring issues such as feminism, gender equality and identity) are all there, but the barrage of story arcs made it difficult for us to be invested in the narrative.&quot; 
==Legacy==

===Impacts on industry===
&quot;Princess Knight&quot; marks the first time Tezuka used his &quot;story comic&quot; format—which uses a narrative structure and cinematic techniques—in a &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. The series changed the concept of &quot;shōjo&quot; from gag comics or strips teaching &quot;good behavior&quot; to narrative-focused works, and thus is considered the first modern work of the genre. It also established elements that would be common in late works of the genre, including an idealized foreign (from a Japanese perspective) settings, a heroine with large eyes, and gender ambiguity with a certain amount of androgyny. In the 1970s, two trends were predominant in &quot;shōjo&quot; manga: the first featured &quot;androgynous, masculine, or asexual protagonists searching for self and love&quot; and the other had &quot;more explicit romance involving an ordinary girl.&quot; Elements of both were already present in Tezuka&#x27;s Sapphire.

The manga is considered to have started the genre of female superheroes, and regarded as a prototype for the magical girl genre. Martin Theron of ANN affirmed the series&#x27; &quot;influence ... is immeasurable, and in a real sense every lead action heroine who has followed is a direct or indirect spiritual descendant of Princess Sapphire/Prince Knight.&quot; Indeed, Sapphire is one of the most recognizable heroines of Tezuka; between March 3–June 27, 2016, the Osamu Tezuka Manga Museum sponsored an art exhibit focused on the &quot;Heroines of Osamu Tezuka,&quot; highlighting Sapphire and Pinoko of &quot;Black Jack&quot;. She was also considered the most iconic heroine in anime history by Thomas Zoth of Mania.com.

This work expanded the scope of Japanese popular culture by opening up the possibility of exploring a wider range of sexual orientations, which goes beyond clear gender binary homo- or heterosexuality. According to Brophy, &quot;&quot;Shōjo&quot; manga&#x27;s rich potential for complex representations of the human psyche in diverse sociocultural contexts was essentially constructed by Tezuka&#x27;s androgynous character Sapphire.&quot; Featuring the first gender-ambiguous heroine, it influenced many works, specially &quot;shōjo&quot;, such as &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot;, which possibilited &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;, &quot;The Sword of Paros&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;″s Sailor Uranus.

===Remakes===
A remake of the original &quot;Princess Knight&quot; manga called &quot;Sapphire: Princess Knight&quot; was written by Natsuko Takahashi and illustrated by Pink Hanamori. Serialized from the May 2008 issue to the July 2009 issue in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;, it was compiled into four &quot;tankōbon&quot; between September 5, 2008, and September 4, 2009.

To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the series, a reboot version of &quot;Princess Knight&quot; started to be published on the online manga magazine &quot;Puratto Home&quot; by Home-sha in July 2013. Called , it is a collaboration with Tezuka Productions and is illustrated by Shōko Fukaki with scenarios by Atsushi Kagurazaka. It lasted forty-one chapters, that were later released on three volumes, of which the first was released on July 25, 2014, along with a drama CD based on it, and the last was published on January 23, 2015.

===Other adaptations===
Because of the success of the first manga, a radio dramatization was created. A serial drama, the &quot;Princess Knight&quot; adaptation was broadcast on Radio Tokyo between April 4, 1955 and September 26, 1955. Almost thirty years later, a theater adaptation of the manga was created by the company Dengeki, running from July 5, 1984 to July 17, 1983. It played at Parco Space Part 3, was directed by Mitsumasa Shinozaki, written by Tsutomu Mukai, and starred Ran Ito. Another musical came in 1998; it was directed by Shunsaku Kawake, written by Kensuke Yokouchi, and starred Yoshihiko Inohara, Sae Isshiki and Ranran Suzuki. Yokouchi wrote another play and directed it himself; it was staged at Kanagawa Prefectural Youth Center in 2011, and starred Mikan Asakura. Yokouchi was also the screenwriter for two other stage adaptations in 2014 and 2016; both were directed by Masanari Ujigawa and staged at Rikkōkai Hall. The former starred Haruka Katayama and Aya Kamiki, while the latter featured Hirono Suzuki and Yui Itō.

In 2006, &quot;Princess Knight&quot; was adapted into a musical, , and performed in Japan by members of the popular idol groups Morning Musume and v-u-den with Ai Takahashi in the lead role. Directed by Shinji Ueda, with screenplay by Shinji Kimura and music by Masato Kai, it played at Shinjuku Koma Theater from August 1 to 27. The Up-Front Works record label Zetima released a music collection and a DVD of the musical on July 26, and November 29, 2006 respectively. Later, on December 25, its television broadcast was done by BS Japan.

In 2015, celebrating the 60th anniversary of &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; magazine, a musical directed by Yukio Ueshima, written by Sayaka Asai and with music composed by Shuhei Kamimura was staged. It starred Nogizaka46&#x27;s Erika Ikuta and Reika Sakurai as Sapphire and Hecate respectively, while Keisuke Kaminaga and Tsunenori Aoki completed the main four in the poster, playing Prince Franz and the pirate Blood respectively.

<text>Egil Kristian Tynæs (12 August 1941 – 2 June 2004) was a Norwegian anthroposophical doctor, senior physician at the Municipal Clinic in Bergen and a humanitarian aid worker. On 2 June 2004, in Badghis, Afghanistan Tynæs and four others (Afghans Fasil Ahmad and Besmillah, Belgian Helene de Beir, and Dutchman Willem Kwint) were killed in an ambush whilst working for the humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières.

Tynæs worked in his everyday life as a senior doctor at the Municipal Polyclinic in Bergen, Norway. He undertook two assignments for Médecins Sans Frontières. He worked for MSF-Switzerland in 2002 in Baharak, Afghanistan and in 2004 for MSF-Netherlands in Badghis. There, he worked on a tuberculosis project and trained local medical staff. He was killed on the final date of his assignment.

==Early years and study==

Egil was born in Lillehammer in 1941. His parents had fled Germany when the conditions for anthroposophical activity and its medical education became worse and worse and eventually ended by being forbidden altogether. As his father came from Germany, he was forced into military service on the Eastern Front where he met his death in Ukraine in 1943. He abstained from fleeing to Sweden for of fear of reprisals against his remaining family in Germany.

After the war Egil and his mother, Sissi Tynæs, moved from Lillehammer to Bergen, where she became one of the pillars and pioneers of Rudolf Steiner work in the town. Jörgen Smit was both Egil&#x27;s godfather and class teacher at the Rudolf Steiner School in Bergen.

Egil went to high school in Bergen. He had decided early in life to become a physician and studied, in Münster, Germany, where he qualified as a doctor in 1970. During the time of his studies he also gained experience working on a biodynamic farm and a Camphill community in Wales. Thereafter he did his housemanship in the anaesthesiology department at Aarhus University Hospital and at Amtssygehus in Skanderborg, Denmark. It was in Denmark that he met his wife Kirsten and started a family of three children together with her in addition to becoming stepfather to her two oldest daughters.

His interest in anthroposophical medicine, however, led him to the surgical department of the Gemeinnützige Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus, Herdecke, a hospital that had been founded and developed to create an academic university environment where the contributions of spiritual science to the art of healing should be integrated and developed. The central force in this work was MD. Dr Gerhard Kienle. Here Egil fell ill with tuberculosis which forced him to resign after two years of work.

==His work in Norway==

The family moved to Bergen, where Egil set up a practice as a GP in 1978, practicing anthroposophic medicine. At the beginning of the 1980s, this was extended to include a therapeuticum in which anthroposophical therapists were active. In addition, he was the school physician at the Waldorf School in Bergen and was connected also to Rostadheimen, an educational institution for Special Needs.

In the early 90s he and Kirsten traveled for a year to Georgia to assist Georgian colleagues in the development of a therapeutic centre. Here again he fell ill with tuberculosis, which caused him to close his general practice in Bergen, qualify as a specialist in internal medicine and take up a post as senior doctor at Bergen&#x27;s municipal outdoor clinic, where he ran its emergency department.

Egil and Kirsten kept an open house where they also organized study groups in anthroposophic medicine. He was one of the initiators of the foundation of the Norwegian Association for anthroposophic medicine (NLFAM), supporting the younger generation of doctors in understanding anthroposophic medicine.

==Mission and death in Afghanistan==

As a 62-year-old grandfather, Egil Tynæs chose to work in Afghanistan twice in two years. The report of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in 2003, with whom he volunteered, states “Afghanistan is neither safe nor stable”; humanitarian agencies&#x27; cars have been “held up and shot at.” In March 2003, Red Cross engineer Ricardo Munguia was murdered by gunmen after they stopped the car he was travelling in.

However, MSF identified Afghanistan as the place with the greatest need for Dr Tynæs&#x27;s skills, especially in treating tuberculosis. He felt it was the right thing to do and wrote: “those of us who live in the wealthy part of the world have a certain responsibility to people who live in poverty and are disadvantaged.&quot; He understood the situation having spent five months in Baharak in Afghanistan in 2002 with the Swiss branch of MSF.

There was a sense of trust that Egil was able to build with patients and the local population in spite of the cultural and linguistic differences. He was double the age of any other member of the team, his grey hair and beard familiar and reassuring in meetings with village elders.

After serving with MSF Switzerland&#x27;s mission in Baharak, a town in northern Afghanistan, he returned in 2003 and helped build MSF in Norway while awaiting his next assignment. It came nearly a year later. It was Afghanistan again, this time the Badghis region in the North-west. The Dutch branch of MSF needed him to lead a local tuberculosis programme, carry out general medical duties and to train local medical staff in basic primary health clinics. By June 2004 the MSF team in Badghis had built up the polyclinic to deal with more than 1000 consultations a month. The TB programme was treating 45 patients and expanding and a mother and baby clinic had opened.

The mission having come to an end, Dr Tynæs and his team appeared happy at having achieved their goal. The next day, on a road near the polyclinic in Khairkhana, the land cruiser in which they were travelling was ambushed with gunfire and grenades killing Dr Tynæs and four other MSF staff.

<text>Database theory encapsulates a broad range of topics related to the study and research of the theoretical realm of databases and database management systems.

Theoretical aspects of data management include, among other areas, the foundations of query languages, computational complexity and expressive power of queries, finite model theory, database design theory, dependency theory, foundations of concurrency control and database recovery, deductive databases, temporal and spatial databases, real-time databases, managing uncertain data and probabilistic databases, and Web data.

Most research work has traditionally been based on the relational model, since this model is usually considered the simplest and most foundational model of interest. Corresponding results for other data models, such as object-oriented or semi-structured models, or, more recently, graph data models and XML, are often derivable from those for the relational model.

Database theory helps one to understand the complexity and power of query languages and their connection to logic. Starting from relational algebra and first-order logic (which are equivalent by Codd&#x27;s theorem) and the insight that important queries such as graph reachability are not expressible in this language, more powerful language based on logic programming and fixpoint logic such as Datalog were studied. The theory also explores foundations of query optimization and data integration. Here most work studied conjunctive queries, which admit query optimization even under constraints using the chase algorithm.

The main research conferences in the area are the ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS) and the International Conference on Database Theory (ICDT).

<doc id="1093625" wikidata="Q464236" url="?curid=1093625" title="Miriam Toews">
<text>Miriam Toews (; born 1964) is a Canadian writer and author of nine books, including &quot;A Complicated Kindness&quot; (2004), &quot;All My Puny Sorrows&quot; (2014), and &quot;Women Talking&quot; (2018). She has won a number of literary prizes including the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction and the Writers&#x27; Trust Engel/Findley Award for her body of work. Toews is also a three-time finalist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and a two-time winner of the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize.

Toews had a leading role in the feature film &quot;Silent Light&quot;, written and directed by Mexican filmmaker Carlos Reygadas, and winner of the 2007 Cannes Jury Prize, an experience that informed her fifth novel, &quot;Irma Voth&quot; (2011).

Toews lives in Toronto and is an adjunct professor at the University of Toronto in the Faculty of Arts &amp; Science.

==Early life==
Toews grew up in Steinbach, Manitoba, Canada the second daughter of Mennonite parents, both part of the Kleine Gemeinde. Through her father, Melvin C. Toews, she is a direct descendant of one of Steinbach&#x27;s first settlers, Klaas R. Reimer (1837–1906), who arrived in Manitoba in 1874 from Ukraine. Her mother, Elvira Loewen, is a daughter of the late C. T. Loewen, an entrepreneur who founded a lumber business that would become Loewen Windows. As a teenager, Toews rode horses and took part in provincial dressage and barrel-racing competitions and attended high school at the Steinbach Regional Secondary School. In 2024, a historic plaque was placed in front of Toews&#x27;s teenage home in Steinbach.

Toews left Steinbach at eighteen, living in Montreal and London before settling in Winnipeg. She has a B.A. in Film Studies from the University of Manitoba, and a Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of King&#x27;s College, Halifax.

==Career==
===Early work===
Toews wrote her first novel, &quot;Summer of My Amazing Luck&quot; (1996), while working as a freelance journalist. The novel explores the evolving friendship of two single mothers in a Winnipeg public housing complex. The novel was developed from a documentary that Toews was preparing for CBC Radio on the subject of welfare mothers. It was shortlisted for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, and the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award. Toews won the latter prize with her second novel, &quot;A Boy of Good Breeding&quot; (1998).

Toews has written for CBC&#x27;s &quot;WireTap&quot;, &quot;Canadian Geographic&quot;, &quot;Geist&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;Intelligent Life&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. In 1999, she won a National Magazine Award Gold Medal for Humour. She is the author of &quot;The X Letters&quot;, a series of personal dispatches addressed to the father of her son, which were featured on &quot;This American Life&quot; in an episode about missing parents.

Toews&#x27; father died by suicide in 1998. His death inspired Toews to write a memoir in her father&#x27;s voice, &quot;Swing Low: A Life&quot;. The book was greeted as an instant classic in the modern literature on mental illness, and it won the Alexander Kennedy Isbister Award for Non-Fiction and the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award.

===&quot;A Complicated Kindness&quot;===
Toews&#x27; third novel, &quot;A Complicated Kindness&quot; (2004), is set in East Village, a small religious Mennonite town much like her native Steinbach. The narrator is Nomi Nickel, a curious, defiant, sardonic sixteen-year-old who dreams of hanging out with Lou Reed in the &#x27;real&#x27; East Village of New York City. She lives alone with her doleful father, after the departure of her older sister and the unexplained disappearance of her mother. Unlike her father, who is a dutiful member of the church, Nomi is rebellious by nature, and her questioning brings her into conflict with the town&#x27;s various authorities, most notably Hans Rosenfeldt, the sanctimonious church pastor.

&quot;A Complicated Kindness&quot; was highly acclaimed nationally and internationally, with the character of Nomi Nickel invoking comparisons to J. D. Salinger&#x27;s Holden Caulfield. It won the 2004 Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction, described by the jury as &quot;an unforgettable coming-of-age story... melancholic and hopeful, as beautifully complicated as life itself.&quot; It was also shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and longlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award. The novel was selected for the 2006 edition of Canada Reads, the first book by a female writer to win the competition.

===&quot;The Flying Troutmans&quot;===
&quot;The Flying Troutmans&quot; (2008) is a road-trip novel narrated by 28-year-old Hattie, who takes charge of her teenage niece and nephew after her sister Min is admitted to a psychiatric ward. Overwhelmed by the responsibility, Hattie enacts an ill-conceived plan to find the kids&#x27; long-lost father in California.

The novel was awarded the 2008 Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize. The jury described the novel as &quot;a love song to young people trying to navigate the volcanic world of adult emotions.&quot; The novel was also longlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction, and named a &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; Best Book.

===&quot;Irma Voth&quot; and &quot;Silent Light&quot;===
With her fifth novel, &quot;Irma Voth&quot; (2011), Toews returned to the Mennonite community to re-examine the ways in which religious communities can limit personal freedom, and how belonging can turn to estrangement when old and new value systems clash. The novel opens in an old order Mennonite settlement in Mexico&#x27;s Chihuahuan Desert. Nineteen-year-old Irma Voth has been banished to a neighbouring farm by her strict, religious father after secretly marrying a non-Mennonite Mexican. Her new husband disappears into the drug trade and Irma is left alone to tend to the farm. Her world is transformed when a filmmaker from Mexico City arrives to make a film about Mennonites. Irma is hired as a translator for the film&#x27;s female protagonist, and her involvement with the wildly creative film crew brings her into dangerous conflict with her father, while at the same time helping her better understand her place in the world. When her father&#x27;s violence escalates and the tragedy that has haunted her family begins to surface, Irma receives the blessing of her mother to flee the encampment, and to take her two younger sisters with her, one of whom is an infant. They eventually settle in Mexico City, where the two older sisters must embrace the ways of the city in order to survive and raise their infant sister.

Toews has said that &quot;Irma Voth&quot; was inspired in part by her experience in playing a lead role in &quot;Silent Light&quot;, the 2007 film written and directed by Mexican filmmaker Carlos Reygadas. Reygadas invited Toews to do a screen test for the role of Esther, a conservative Mennonite wife, after reading her third novel, &quot;A Complicated Kindness&quot;, and seeing her author photo on the back flap of the book. The film was shot in Plautdietsch, a language neither the director nor Toews fully understood. Toews worked with her mother, a native speaker of Plautdietsch, to deliver her lines phonetically. The film won a number of international awards, including the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Toews was nominated for Best Actress at Mexico&#x27;s Ariel Awards for her performance, one of nine nominations for the film.

Filmed in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, the film depicts the same Mennonite community that features in Toews&#x27; novel. &quot;&quot;Irma Voth&quot; and &quot;Silent Light&quot; provide interesting counterpoint views of a culture as seen through the eyes of an outsider. Of course, Reygadas and the fictional filmmaker in &quot;Irma Voth&quot; portray a society within its insular context, a culture out of time and place, while Toews and Irma Voth have learned to coexist in both worlds.&quot;

===&quot;All My Puny Sorrows&quot;===
&quot;All My Puny Sorrows&quot; (2014) recounts the tumultuous relationship of the Von Riesen sisters, Elfrieda and Yolandi, the only children of an intellectual, free-spirited family from a conservative Mennonite community. Yolandi, the novel&#x27;s narrator, has always lived in her sister&#x27;s shadow. Whereas Elfrieda is a gifted, beautiful, happily married, and much celebrated concert pianist, Yolandi feels like a failure, with a floundering writing career and teenage children from separate fathers. Yet it is Elfrieda who suffers from acute depression and a desire to die, much like her father before her, who killed himself by stepping in front of a train. When Elfrieda makes a second suicide attempt on the eve of an international concert tour, Yolandi makes it her mission to save her sister, even as Elf begs her to accompany her to a Swiss clinic and enable her death. Yolandi writes: &quot;She wanted to die and I wanted her to live and we were enemies who loved each other.&quot;

Toews has said that the novel draws heavily on events leading up to the 2010 suicide of her only sibling Marjorie.

&quot;All My Puny Sorrows&quot; received starred reviews in &quot;Library Journal&quot;, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and was a Reference and Users Services Association Notable Book. It also appeared on a number of year-end best-book lists, including &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. The novel won the 2014 Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize. The jury described it as &quot;a haunting novel of tremendous feeling, beautifully written and profoundly humane... Miriam Toews, a dazzling literary alchemist who manages to summon all the joyous and heart-breaking humanity of her characters, has produced a work of astonishing depth. Reading it is an unforgettable experience.&quot; The novel was also awarded Italy&#x27;s 2015 Sinbad Prize for Foreign Fiction. 
&quot;All My Puny Sorrows&quot; was shortlisted for the 2014 Scotiabank Giller Prize, the 2015 Folio Prize for Literature, and the 2015 Wellcome Book Prize. It was longlisted for the 2015 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction and the 2016 International Dublin Literary Award.

The novel&#x27;s French translation, &quot;Pauvres petits chagrins&quot;, was selected for the 2019 edition of Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Le Combat des livres&quot;, where it was defended by writer Deni Ellis Béchard.

A film adaptation of the book, directed by Michael McGowan, was released in 2021.

===&quot;Women Talking&quot;===
In a note at the start of &quot;Women Talking&quot; (2018), Toews describes the novel as &quot;a reaction through fiction&quot; to the true-life events that took place between 2005 and 2009 on the Manitoba Colony, a remote Mennonite community in Bolivia. Girls and women would regularly wake up in the mornings to discover they had been sexually violated. The attacks were dismissed as &quot;wild female imagination&quot;, or else attributed to ghosts or demons. Eventually it was discovered that a group of colony men had been spraying an animal anesthetic into neighboring houses at night, rendering everyone unconscious, and raping the women (infants, elderly, and relatives included). The colony elders, deciding that the case was too difficult to handle themselves, called local police to take the perpetrators into custody.

Toews&#x27; novel centers on eight women of varying ages who, in the aftermath of such traumatic events, must determine what to do next. As they see it, they have three options: do nothing; stay and fight; or leave. The stakes are high, and they must come to a decision quickly. The colony men, who are away to post bail for the rapists, will soon be returning. Over the course of two days, in the privacy of a hayloft, the women have a series of fierce, philosophical debates. They discuss how they will heal, protect their children, educate their sons, keep their faith, and forgive. The colony&#x27;s bishop, Peters, has told them that if they refuse to forgive their offenders, they will be denied entry into heaven.

The novel is presented as the minutes of the women&#x27;s meetings, which are taken by August Epp, the colony schoolteacher (and the novel&#x27;s narrator) who has returned to the community after being excommunicated. Unlike the women, he has experience of the outside world, and is able to read and write and speak English (the women speak only Plautdietsch, an unwritten dialect of East Low German). He performs his role of minute taker at the request of Ona Friesen, the object of his unrequited love and his childhood friend, who is one of the eight women in the hayloft. As time runs short for the women, and they begin to put their action plan into motion, August&#x27;s story is also revealed.

The novel was a shortlisted finalist for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language fiction at the 2018 Governor General&#x27;s Awards, and for the 2019 Trillium Book Award.

A film adaptation of the book, directed by Sarah Polley, and produced by and featuring Frances McDormand, Rooney Mara, and Claire Foy, was released in late 2022. At the 95th Academy Awards, Polley won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for her adaptation of Toews&#x27; novel.

===&quot;Fight Night&quot;===
Toews&#x27; eighth novel, &quot;Fight Night&quot;, focuses on a multigenerational family of women living in Toronto: the feisty, tomboyish 9-year-old Swiv, her heavily pregnant mother (nicknamed Mooshie), and her spirited and extraordinarily lively grandmother, Elvira. Recently expelled from school, Swiv helps her grandmother with bathing and chores, accompanies her around the city, and eventually travels with her to Fresno, California to meet members of their extended family. In exchange, Swiv learns about what it means to survive through the ups and downs of life, and of her grandmother&#x27;s story of despair, betrayal, stolen agency, and joy. The novel&#x27;s structure takes the form of a letter Swiv writes to her absent father about life in the close-knit (yet often dysfunctional) household. As Swiv records her thoughts and observations, &quot;Fight Night&quot; unspools the pain, laughter, and unconditional love in the three women&#x27;s stories, as they speak to what it takes to fight – painfully, joyously, and ferociously – and survive in life.

==Personal life==
Toews&#x27; father, Melvin C. Toews, suffered from bipolar disorder much of his life. He was an active and well-respected elementary school teacher who lobbied to establish Steinbach&#x27;s first public library. After his death by suicide, the Steinbach Library Board opened the Melvin C. Toews Reading Garden on the grounds of the library he worked to create. Toews&#x27; older sister and only sibling, Marjorie, died by suicide in 2010, almost 12 years to the day after their father.

Toews&#x27; partner is Erik Rutherford, the screenwriter for the 2021 film &quot;Charlotte&quot;. Her daughter, Georgia Toews, and son, Owen Toews, are both writers. Georgia&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Hey, Good Luck Out There,&quot; was published in 2022, while Owen&#x27;s &quot;Stolen City: Racial Capitalism and the Making of Winnipeg&quot; was published in 2019.

<doc id="1093628" wikidata="Q1682434" url="?curid=1093628" title="Smoked meat">
<text>Smoked meat is the result of a method of preparing red meat, white meat, and seafood which originated in the Paleolithic Era. Smoking adds flavor, improves the appearance of meat through the Maillard reaction, and when combined with curing it preserves the meat. When meat is cured then cold-smoked, the smoke adds phenols and other chemicals that have an antimicrobial effect on the meat. Hot smoking has less impact on preservation and is primarily used for taste and to slow-cook the meat. Interest in barbecue and smoking is on the rise worldwide.

==Smoking with wood==

Generally meat is smoked using hardwood or wood pellets made from hardwood; softwood is not recommended due to increased PAH from the resin. Wood smoke adds flavor, aroma, and helps with preservation. There are two types of smoking: cold smoking generally occurs below and has more preservative value. Hot smoking generally occurs above . Most woods are seasoned and not used green. There are many types of wood used for smoking; a partial list includes:
* Woods with a mild flavor: Alder, apple, apricot, ash, birch, cherry, maple, peach, pear.
* Woods with a medium flavor: Almond, hickory, pecan, post oak, pasania.
* Woods with a strong flavor: Acacia, black walnut, chokecherry, grapevine, mesquite.
* Other woods and organic matter: Avocado, bay, beech, butternut, carrotwood, camphor, castanopsis, chestnut, citrus woods, cottonwood, crabapple, fig, guava, gum, hackberry, kiawe, lilac, madrone, mulberry, olive, peat, plum, persimmon, pimento, tea, and willow.

==Types==
===African fish smoking===

Close to 80% of all fish caught in most African nations is smoked. Traditionally the processing and smoking of fish has been done by women. The primary method of smoking is hot smoking, the flavor from hot smoking preferred by local consumers. Traditional smoking methods include using bamboo racks over smoky fires, mud ovens and placing the fish directly on smoldering woods and grasses. Modern methods of smoking include using re-purposed oil drums, brick ovens, and Chorkor ovens.

===American barbecue (smoked)===

American barbecue&#x27;s roots start with the Native Americans who smoked fish and game to preserve food for leaner times. When Europeans first came to North America, they brought with them smoking techniques from Europe and Central Asia and combined those with the Native American techniques. American barbecue has distinct regional differences: North Carolina Piedmont style is pork shoulder with a vinegar &amp; ketchup-based sauce; Eastern style is the whole hog with vinegar &amp; pepper-based sauce; South Carolina is whole hog or shoulder with a mustard-based sauce; Western Tennessee and Memphis are famous for its dry rub ribs, but wet is also available; Kentucky is known for their mutton, pork shoulder and whole hog are also very popular; Kansas City barbecue is more about the sauce, often used with smoked pork, lamb, chicken, beef and turkey. Beef ribs, smoked sausage, brisket are the prevalent meats in Texas.

===Bacon===

Bacon originated with &quot;petaso&quot;, a Roman version of what is now called bacon. The etymology of the word &quot;bacon&quot; has four possibilities; the Franceis word &quot;bacon&quot;, the Althochdeutsch word &quot;bahho&quot;, the Old Low Franconian word &quot;baken&quot;, and the Common Germanic word &quot;bakkon&quot;. John Harris of Calne, England, was the first to commercialize production of bacon in the 1770s. Bacon is primarily pork, depending on the type; it can come from the belly, back, loin or side. The preparation of bacon varies by type, but most involve curing and smoking. Some of the types of bacon include American ( side bacon or streaky bacon), buckboard (shoulder bacon), Canadian (back bacon), British and Irish (rasher), Australian (middle bacon), Italian (pancetta), Hungarian (szalonna), German (speck), Japanese (beikon), and Slovakian (oravská). Bacon can also be produced from beef, lamb, and wild game.

===Country ham===
Country ham is a popular ham originally developed by American Colonists who took traditional Native American fish smoking practices and used them for pork. Country hams traditionally were made in the American Southeast from Virginia to Missouri. Most country hams are trimmed, wrapped, cured in salt, sugar, pepper and various spices. In modern times, some preparations add nitrates for food safety. After curing the hams are smoked for at least 12 hours, then hung to dry for 9 to 12 months. Some traditional processes can take years from curing to being ready to consume.

===Finnan haddie===

Finnan haddie is a cold smoked haddock that originated in medieval times in the Scottish village of Findon. Traditionally the haddock is smoked with green wood and peat. Smoked finnan haddie is the colour of straw, newer commercial methods of drying without smoke produce a gold or yellow colour. Until the 1800s when regular rail service was established, finnan haddie remained a local dish, now it can be found in markets worldwide.

===Katsuobushi===

Katsuobushi is a key umami ingredient in Japanese cuisine, with bonito flakes among its many applications. Katsuobushi is made from skipjack tuna that is washed, quartered smoked with oak, pasania, or castanopsis wood, and cooled repeatedly for a month. Some producers will spray the fish with Aspergillus glaucus to promote further drying. After one to 24 months the fish will be katsu (hard) and ready for use. To make bonito flakes it is shaved very thinly using a Katsuobushi grater box.

===Montreal-style smoked meat===
A type of kosher-style deli meat product made by salting and curing beef brisket with spices. The brisket is allowed to absorb the flavours over a week, is then hot smoked to cook through, and finally is steamed to completion. The preparation method may be similar to New York pastrami, but Montreal smoked meat is cured in seasoning with more cracked peppercorns and savoury flavourings, such as coriander, garlic, and mustard seeds, and significantly less sugar.

===Pastrami===

Pastrami is most often made with beef brisket; it can be made with other cuts of beef. The meat is cured in a brine (most often dry), after drying, it is coated in spices and smoked. Smoking can be done by either cold smoking or hot smoking. Pastrami evolved from the Turkish Huns who would tenderize and dry meat under their saddles. Armenians saw what the Huns had done and created basturma that was spiced and air-dried meat. Romanians first started brining, spicing, and smoking the beef and created what is now called pastrami. When Romanian Jews immigrated to the United States, Canada, and Great Britain in the late 1800s, they carried that tradition of pastrami with them. The Romanians that immigrated to the United States, mostly settled in New York City area and developed the classic New York Pastrami. Those that immigrated to Canada mostly settled in Montreal used a different brining technique and spices and called it smoked meat. Pastrami is still produced in Southwest Asia and the Middle East and is called Pastirma, basterma or basturma. While customarily made with beef, in other regions it can be made with lamb, goat, buffalo, and camel. Corned or salt beef uses a similar brine and spices, but is not smoked.

===Zhangcha duck===

Zhangcha duck is a dish from Sichuan Province in southwestern China made from the Chengdu Ma duck. The duck is marinated in a pickling liquid then smoked with camphor and tea leaves. After smoking, the duck is deep fried, boned and served over rice.

==Health concerns==
One study has shown an association between the frequency of consumption of smoked foods and intestinal cancer. However, the study was restricted to a small Slovenian population in Hungary, where the local smoke curing process produces levels of contaminants roughly eight times as high as standard processes elsewhere. The use of soft woods is discouraged, as the resins in softwood increases the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are known carcinogens.

<text>Niko Nirvi (born 16 February 1961 in Jokioinen, Finland), pen name Nnirvi, is a long-term major icon in the Finnish gaming world. He is well known for writing computer game reviews since the 1980s in &quot;MikroBitti&quot;, &quot;C=Lehti&quot; and the computer game yearbooks that were predecessors of the &quot;Pelit&quot; magazine. He has worked for the latter since its founding in 1992, and holds a column in addition to making reviews and other reports.

Nirvi began his career as a game reviewer in 1986 on pages of MikroBitti. He had made a bet with his friend that he could get his review published in the magazine. He sent two reviews, Zoids and Uridium and the former was published (they already had one Uridium review). Nirvi wrote reviews and a regular column about new games for Mikrobitti and became the &quot;game editor&quot; of the magazine. He also wrote reviews for C=Lehti. When &quot;Pelit&quot;, that concentrated solely on gaming, was founded by the same publisher, Nirvi joined its ranks as an editor, and has written a regular column for each issue.

Nirvi&#x27;s trademarks include signing with &quot;Nnirvi&quot; or a variation, and never showing his face in the magazine. Photos of him are always either covered or edited in a way that the face is unrecognizable. His personal picture in his articles is usually a gaming or movie character whose face is blurred (for example Master Chief) while the rest of the crew&#x27;s articles feature their real faces. Wallu&#x27;s drawings of Nirvi depict him as a bearded man with Spock&#x27;s Vulcan ears. According to Nirvi, his avoidance of publicity started in 1988, when a MikroBitti reader asked for a photograph of him, which Nirvi instantly declined, and this avoidance has strengthened ever since. &quot;I replied no, and then it started feeling like a good idea. Everyone can imagine what I look like on their own&quot;, Nirvi said in an interview in &quot;Suomen Kuvalehti&quot; in 2021. Nirvi does not even allow verbal descriptions of his appearance. However, he has sometimes been described as &quot;a large, dark-haired man&quot; and his colleague Jukka O. Kauppinen has described him as &quot;hairy&quot;.

In 2012, Nirvi was awarded as Game Journalist of the Year at the FIGMA audience awards. Avoiding any publicity, Nirvi did not arrive to collect his award.

Nirvi&#x27;s style is typically humorous and sometimes unorthodox. Some of Nirvi&#x27;s most unconventional reviews were published in C=Lehti. The review of Domark&#x27;s motorboat game Hydra was written as a nursery rhyme from the beginning to the end. The review of Battle Island contained just two words: &quot;Paska Commando-klooni.&quot; (&quot;shitty Commando clone.&quot;)

==Personal opinions==
Nirvi has made it clear that he does not like sports or sports related video games. He has been a big fan of Babylon 5, Star Wars and Star Trek. He has also stated that he has read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; over ten times.

Nirvi has given several statements about the usefulness of computer gaming. At one interview he said that gaming is a completely useless hobby. On the first issue of Pelit (1992) he wrote that gaming helps people overcome their fears towards computers (that is typical for some old people). In another interview he declared that many strategy games can develop the players&#x27; intellectual capabilities: they can teach English, history and strategic thinking.

Nirvi&#x27;s favorite games from the 1980s are Star Wars (Atari&#x27;s arcade game), Ultima IV, Hack (the precursor of NetHack), Elite and Dungeon Master. In 2000 he stated that the best PC game ever is X-COM: UFO Defense.

<text>Niederwenigern is a small borough of the city of Hattingen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is situated on the river Ruhr, 4 km east of Kupferdreh (a borough of Essen) and 3 km west of the center of Hattingen. The population is about 6,000 and before 1926, it was an independent municipality. Niederwenigern has a large 19th-century Roman Catholic church, the St. Mauritius Church. There is also a Lutheran-Evangelical Protestant church. There is also a museum dedicated to Nikolaus Groß, a Catholic and trade union resistance fighter in the time of the Third Reich. 

Niederwenigern has two kindergartens, two primary schools and some smaller shops for daily needs. Famous is the yearly &quot;Mauritius Kirmes&quot;, a typical small fun fair celebrated at the end of September in relation to the saint&#x27;s day of St. Mauritius. Its popularity is founded in the fact that a lot of (former) residents come back to Niederwenigern at this weekend to meet old friends. The fair lasts three days (Saturday through Monday). </text><links>

<doc id="1093644" wikidata="Q4554335" url="?curid=1093644" title="1830s in Western fashion">
<text>1830s fashion in Western and Western-influenced fashion is characterized by an emphasis on &quot;breadth&quot;, initially at the shoulder and later in the hips, in contrast to the narrower silhouettes that had predominated between 1800 and 1820.

Women&#x27;s costume featured larger sleeves than were worn in any period before or since, which were accompanied by elaborate hairstyles and large hats.

The final months of the 1830s saw the proliferation of a revolutionary new technology—photography. Hence, the infant industry of photographic portraiture preserved for history a few rare, but invaluable, first images of human beings—and therefore also preserved our earliest, live peek into &quot;fashion in action&quot;—and its impact on everyday life and society as a whole.

==General trends==
The prevalent trend of Romanticism from the 1820s through the mid-1840s, with its emphasis on strong emotion as a source of aesthetic experience and its recognition of the picturesque, was reflected in fashion as in other arts. Items of historical dress including neck ruffs, &quot;ferronnières&quot; (jeweled headbands worn across the forehead), and sleeves based on styles of earlier periods were popular.

Innovations in roller printing on textiles introduced new dress fabrics. Rich colors such as the Turkey red of the 1820s were still found, but delicate floral prints on light backgrounds were increasingly popular. More precise printing eliminated the need for dark outlines on printed designs, and new green dyes appeared in patterns of grasses, ferns, and unusual florals. Combinations of florals and stripes were fashionable.

Overall, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fashion showed width at the shoulder above a tiny waist. Men&#x27;s coats were padded in the shoulders and across the chest, while women&#x27;s shoulders sloped to huge sleeves.

==Women&#x27;s fashions==


===Overview===
In the 1830s, fashionable women&#x27;s clothing styles had distinctive large &#x27;leg of mutton&#x27; or gigot sleeves, above large full conical skirts, ideally with a narrow, low waist, achieved through a combination of corsetry to restrict the waist and full sleeves and skirts that made the waist appear smaller by comparison. Heavy stiff fabrics such as brocades were fashionable after the aesthetic simplicity of fashion from 1795 to 1820, and many 18th-century gowns were cut up into new garments. There was an emphasis on sloping shoulders and large, full sleeves over much of the arm, with a small cuff at the wrist, which are distinctive to day dresses of the 1830s.

&quot;Pelerines&quot;, tippets, or lace coverings draped over the shoulders, were popular (one of several garments, along with full upper-arm sleeves and wide necklines, to emphasize the shoulders and their width).

===Gowns===
The fashionable feminine figure, with its sloping shoulders, rounded bust, narrow waist and full hips, was emphasized in various ways with the cut and trim of gowns. To about 1835, the small waist was accentuated with a wide belt (a fashion continuing from the 1820s). Later the waist and midriff were unbelted but cut close to the body, and the bodice began to taper to a small point at the front waist. The fashionable corset now had gores to individually cup the breasts, and the bodice was styled to emphasize this shape.

Gowns had very wide necklines and short, puffed sleeves reaching to the elbow from a dropped shoulder, and were worn with mid-length gloves. The width at the shoulder was often emphasized by gathered or pleated panels of fabric arranged horizontally over the bust and around the shoulders.

Morning dresses generally had high necklines, and shoulder width was emphasized with tippets or wide collars that rested on the gigot sleeves. Summer afternoon dresses might have wide, low necklines similar to gowns, but with long sleeves. Skirts were pleated into the waistband of the bodice, and held out with starched petticoats of linen or cotton.

Prior to 1835, fashionable skirts could be worn at ankle-length, but as the decade continued this fell out of fashion.

===Hairstyles and Headgear===

Early 1830s hair was parted in the center and dressed in elaborate curls, loops and knots extending out to both sides and up from the crown of the head. Braids were fashionable, and were likewise looped over either ear and gathered into a topknot.

Bonnets with wide semicircular brims framed the face for street wear, and were heavily decorated with trim, ribbons, and feathers.

Married women wore a linen or cotton cap for daywear, trimmed with lace, ribbon, and frills, and tied under the chin. The cap was worn alone indoors and under the bonnet for street wear.

For evening wear, hair ornaments including combs, ribbons, flowers, and jewels were worn; other options included berets and turbans.

In the Río de la Plata cities of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, the fashion for &quot;peinetones&quot;—which was unique to the region—became immensely popular. Although its origin can be traced back to the traditional Spanish &quot;peineta&quot; comb, the &quot;peinetón&quot; derived into a different headpiece altogether, both for its physical characteristics as well as for the symbolic meanings around its use. They were defined by their extravagant size, measuring up to in height and width at the height of their popularity. The use of the &quot;peinetón&quot; was a local addition to the over-the-top fashion of the Romantic era that characterized Western fashion of the period. 

===Undergarments===

Women&#x27;s undergarments consisted of a knee-length linen chemise with straight, elbow length sleeves. Corsets compressed the waist and skirts were held in shape by layers of starched petticoats, stiffened with tucks and cording. The full sleeves were supported by down-filled &quot;sleeve plumpers&quot;.

===Outerwear===
Riding habits consisted of a high-necked, tight-waisted jacket with the fashionable dropped shoulder and huge gigot sleeves, worn over a tall-collared shirt or chemisette, with a long matching petticoat or skirt. Tall top hats with veils were worn.

Shawls were worn with short-sleeved evening gowns early in the decade, but they were not suited to the wide gigot sleeves of the mid-1830s.

Full-length mantles were worn to about 1836, when mantles became shorter. A &quot;mantlet&quot; or &quot;shawl-mantlet&quot; was a shaped garment like a cross between a shawl and a mantle, with points hanging down in front. The &quot;burnous&quot; was a three-quarter length mantle with a hood, named after the similar garment of Arabia. The &quot;paletot&quot; was knee-length, with three cape-collars and slits for the arms, and the &quot;pardessus&quot; was half or three-quarter length coat with a defined waist and sleeves.

For evening, voluminous mantles of velvet or satin, with fur trim or fur linings in cold climates, were worn with the gown.

===Footwear===

Low, square-toed slippers were made of fabric or leather for daytime and of satin for evening wear. Low boots with elastic insets appeared in this decade.

==Men&#x27;s fashion==

===Overview===
In this time, men&#x27;s fashion plates continue to show an ideal silhouette with broad shoulders, and a narrow, tightly cinched waist.

===Coats and waistcoats===
Frock coats (in French redingotes) increasingly replaced tail coats for informal day wear. They were calf length, and might be double-breasted. Shoulder emphasis fell lower on the arm; shoulders were sloped and puffed sleeve heads gradually shrank and then disappeared. Waistcoats or vests were single- or double-breasted, with rolled shawl or (later) notched collars, and extremely tight through the waist. Waistcoats were sometimes worn two at time, in contrasting colors. Corsets or corset-like garments were worn by many men to draw in the waistline. The most fashionable coats had padded shoulders and chests, a feature that disappeared after about 1837.

===Trousers===
Full-length trousers began to have the modern fly-front closure, replacing the earlier fall-front. Breeches remained a requirement for formal functions at the British court (as they would be throughout the century). Breeches continued to be worn for horseback riding and other country pursuits, especially in Britain, with tall fitted boots.

===Outerwear===

Cloaks were worn with evening wear. Overcoats with wide sleeves were worn with day wear; these were often called &quot;greatcoats&quot;.

===Hats and hairstyles===
The crowns of tall hats were less curvy than in the previous period. Hair was generally parted to one side. Curled hair and sideburns remained fashionable, along with moustaches.

==Children&#x27;s fashion==
In this period, small boys wore sashed tunics over trousers, sometimes with a round-collared shirt underneath. By the 1830s the skeleton suit had fallen out of fashion. Older boys wore short jackets and trousers with round-collared shirts.

Girls wore simplified versions of women&#x27;s fashion.

<text>Pauline Holdstock is a British-Canadian novelist, essayist and short fiction writer with a focus on historical fiction. 
Born and raised in England, she came to Canada in 1974, and resides in Victoria, British Columbia.
After a ten-year teaching career in the UK, the Caribbean, and Canada, she wrote her first novel. &quot;The Blackbird&#x27;s Song&quot; (1989) launched her professional full-time writing career when it was shortlisted for the Books in Canada/W.H. Smith Best First Novel Award and subsequently reviewed favourably in the UK. She is the author of ten works of fiction and non-fiction in addition to reviews and articles for national newspapers and for websites. Her books have been published in the UK, the US, Portugal, Brazil, Australia and Germany as well as in Canada. Her novel &quot;Beyond Measure&quot; brought Holdstock&#x27;s work to a wider audience, being a finalist for both the Giller Prize and the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize and winning the BC Book Prizes Ethel Wilson Fiction Award. Her novella &quot;The World of Light Were We Live&quot;, as yet unpublished in book form, was the winner of the Malahat Review Novella Contest 2006. &quot;Into the Heart of the Country&quot;, the story of Samuel Hearne&#x27;s surrender of Prince of Wales Fort, was published in 2011 and longlisted for the Giller Prize. Her most recent novel, &quot;The Hunter and the Wild Girl&quot;, listed as a best book for 2015 by both the CBC and the National Post, was a finalist for the BC Book Prizes in 2016 and went on to win the City of Victoria Butler Book prize. Holdstock&#x27;s other literary activities include presentations, sessional teaching (University of Victoria), mentoring (Banff Centre for the Arts), adjudicating arts awards and co-producing a literary reading series.

<text>The Division of Calwell is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria.

Calwell contains the outer north-western fringe of Melbourne. It includes the suburbs of Broadmeadows, Dallas, Coolaroo, Greenvale, Meadow Heights, Roxburgh Park, Craigieburn and Mickleham.

Calwell has been a safe Labor seat since it was created in 1984. Calwell has had only two members, Dr. Andrew Theophanous, from 1984 to 2001, and the current MP Maria Vamvakinou, since 2001. Both are members of the Australian Labor Party.

==History==

The division was created in 1984 and is named for Arthur Calwell, who was Minister for Immigration 1945–1949 and Leader of the Australian Labor Party 1960–1967.

Calwell has been a safe Labor seat since it was first contested. The seat&#x27;s first MP elected in 1984 was Andrew Theophanous. After failing to retain Labor preselection due to issues of criminality, Theophanous unsuccessfully contested the 2001 election as an Independent, polling 9.6% of the vote. The current Member for Calwell, since the 2001 federal election, is Maria Vamvakinou, a member of the Australian Labor Party. Calwell is currently Labor&#x27;s second safest seat, with 68.80% on the 2PP.

At the 2011 Census, Calwell had the nation&#x27;s most stable population, with only 25.6% of residents having moved in the last five years. The electorate had the nation&#x27;s third highest proportion of Catholics (38.5%) and the third highest proportion of residents of Islamic faith (16.8%), the highest in Victoria.

In 2017, Calwell had the highest &quot;no&quot; vote for marriage equality in Victoria, with 56.8% of the electorate&#x27;s respondents to the survey responding &quot;No&quot;. 

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division is located in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne. It covers an area of approximately from in the north to in the south and from in the west to in the east. Localities include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ; as well as part of , , and .

== Demographics ==
Calwell is a diverse and socially conservative electorate. Calwell includes Victoria&#x27;s largest Iraqi community along with Turkish and Lebanese diaspora. While a stronghold for the centre-left Labor Party, the religious migrant community rallied against same-sex marriage in 2017, with 17.7% of the electorate from an Islamic background, six times the state average, while 34% are Catholic, 12% higher than the rest of the state.

The incumbent MP, Maria Vamvakinou, is herself a migrant from the Greek island of Lefkada and her parents migrated to Melbourne when she was four. She is fluent in Greek and taught the language in her time as a teacher.

<text>&quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; is an English Christmas carol that first appeared in 1739 in the collection &quot;Hymns and Sacred Poems&quot;. The carol, based on , tells of an angelic chorus singing praises to God. As it is known in the modern era, it features lyrical contributions from Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, two of the founding ministers of Methodism, with music adapted from &quot;Vaterland, in deinen Gauen&quot; of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s cantata &quot;Festgesang&quot; (&quot;Gutenberg Cantata&quot;).

Wesley had written the original version as &quot;Hymn for Christmas-Day&quot; with the opening couplet &quot;! how all the (heaven) rings / Glory to the King of Kings&quot;. Whitefield changed that to today&#x27;s familiar lyric: &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels sing, / &#x27;Glory to the new-born King. In 1840—a hundred years after the publication of &quot;Hymns and Sacred Poems&quot;—Mendelssohn composed a cantata to commemorate Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s invention of movable type, and it is music from this cantata, adapted by the English musician William H. Cummings to fit the lyrics of &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;, that is used for the carol today.

==Textual history==
The original hymn text was written as a &quot;Hymn for Christmas-Day&quot; by Charles Wesley, included in the 1739 John Wesley collection &quot;Hymns and Sacred Poems.&quot; The first stanza (verse) describes the announcement of Jesus&#x27;s birth. Wesley&#x27;s original hymn began with the opening line &quot;Hark how all the Welkin rings&quot;. This was changed to the familiar &quot;Hark! the Herald Angels sing&quot; by George Whitefield in his 1754 &quot;Collection of Hymns for Social Worship&quot;. A second change was made in the 1782 publication of the Tate and Brady &quot;New Version of the Psalms of David&quot;. In this work, Whitefield&#x27;s adaptation of Wesley&#x27;s hymn appears, with the repetition of the opening line &quot;Hark! the Herald Angels sing/ Glory to the newborn king&quot; at the end of each stanza, as it is commonly sung today. The hymn has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 8337.

== Melodies ==

===Mendelssohn melody===

In 1855, British musician William Hayman Cummings, organist at Waltham Abbey Church, adapted Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s secular music from &quot;Festgesang&quot; to fit the lyrics of &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; written by Charles Wesley. Wesley had originally envisioned the words being sung to the same tune as his Easter hymn &quot;Christ the Lord Is Risen Today&quot;.

&quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; was regarded as one of the Great Four Anglican Hymns and published as number 403 in &quot;The Church Hymn Book&quot; (New York and Chicago, 1872).

In Britain, &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; has popularly been performed in an arrangement that maintains the basic original William H. Cummings harmonisation of the Mendelssohn tune for the first two verses, but adds a soprano descant and a last verse harmonisation for the organ in verse three by Sir David Willcocks. This arrangement was first published in 1961 by Oxford University Press in the first book of the &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot; series. For many years it has served as the recessional hymn of the annual service of Nine Lessons and Carols at King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge.

==== Advent adaptation ====
Mendelssohn&#x27;s melody has been used for a 1990 Advent song in German, &quot;In das Warten dieser Welt&quot; (Into the waiting of this world) by Johannes Jourdan. It is part of regional sections of the common Catholic hymnal &quot;Gotteslob&quot; and songbooks.

===Handel melody===

An uncommon arrangement of the hymn to the tune &quot;See, the Conqu&#x27;ring hero comes&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot;, normally associated with the hymn &quot;Thine Be the Glory&quot;, is traditionally used as the recessional hymn of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. This is broadcast live each year on Christmas Eve on RTÉ Radio 1. The usual (first) three verses are divided into six verses, each with chorus. The arrangement features a brass fanfare with drums in addition to the cathedral organ, and takes about seven and a half minutes to sing. The Victorian organist W. H. Jude, in his day a popular composer, also composed a new setting of the work, published in his &quot;Music and the Higher Life&quot;.

<text>Schmaltz (also spelled schmalz or shmalz) is rendered (clarified) chicken or goose fat. It is an integral part of traditional Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, where it has been used for centuries in a wide array of dishes, such as chicken soup, latkes, matzah brei, chopped liver, matzah balls, fried chicken, and many others, as a cooking fat, spread, or flavor enhancer.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Schmaltz&quot; is a noun derived from the German verb , meaning &quot;to melt&quot;. The verb can be traced back to the West Germanic root , which survives in the Modern English verb &quot;smelt&quot;. The term entered English usage through Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews who used to refer to kosher poultry fat; the Yiddish word refers to rendered chicken fat. The English term &quot;schmaltz&quot; is derived from Yiddish and is cognate with the German term , which can refer to any rendered fat of animal origin, including lard (more precisely ) and clarified butter (); though according to German law, must exclusively refer to a lard-based product in a commercial context. English use tends to follow Yiddish, which limits the meaning of &quot;schmaltz&quot; to rendered poultry fat.

== History ==

Historically, chicken and to a lesser extent other poultry have been the most popular meat in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine due to restrictions on Jews who often were not allowed to own land in Europe, and thereby were not able to tend to any livestock requiring pasture. Among kosher domestic animals, only chickens and other fowl could be raised without pasturage. Schmaltz originated in the Jewish communities of north, west, and central Europe as it was an economical replacement for olive oil that typically was not available in these areas. Olive oil previously had an important role in Jewish culture. It had been used by the ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews in their Ancient Israelite cuisine prior to the forced exile of Jews from Roman Israel, and it remained popular in Sephardic and Mizrahi cuisines.

As olive oil and other vegetable oils (e.g. sesame oil, which Jews had used in Mesopotamia) were unavailable in northwestern Europe, Ashkenazi Jews turned to animal sources, like their Gentile neighbors. However, &quot;kashrut&quot; prohibited Jews from using the most common cooking fats in northern Europe, namely butter and lard. Butter, being derived from milk, cannot be used with meat under the Jewish prohibition on mixing meat and dairy, while lard is derived from pork, a meat not considered kosher. Furthermore, even among the less common fats available, tallow derived from beef or mutton would have been uneconomical, particularly given that virtually all suet (the raw material for tallow) is &quot;chelev&quot; and its consumption is forbidden. Thus Ashkenazi Jews turned to poultry fat as their cooking fat of choice. This fat, which they called &quot;schmaltz&quot;, became the most popular cooking fat used in the shtetls (Jewish villages) of central and eastern Europe. It was commonly used in a multitude of dishes served with, or containing, meat in accordance with kosher dietary laws. 

At the turn of the twentieth century, as the Ashkenazi Jews fled escalating antisemitism and persecution in Europe and sought refuge in the United States and other countries, they brought with them their traditional foods, including schmaltz. It remained popular in American Jewish cuisine until it fell out of common use over the course of the second half of the century due to the inconvenience involved in its preparation, health concerns regarding its saturated fat content, various diet trends, and aggressive marketing by Crisco of their vegetable shortening (which is pareve, i.e. suitable for use with both milk and meat dishes) to the Jewish community of New York.

Over time, schmaltz was replaced with what often were vegetarian alternatives that were perceived to be healthier, such as the aforementioned vegetable shortening, then readily available olive oil, and margarine. Despite this, schmaltz remained in common use at Jewish delicatessens and Jewish restaurants as well as among those in the Haredi community.

Beginning in the twenty-first century, however, schmaltz regained much of its former popularity as various celebrity chefs such as Anthony Bourdain, Alon Shaya, Michael Solomonov, Joan Nathan, and others began to incorporate it into various dishes and recipes as part of emerging food trends popularizing long-forgotten Jewish foods. Schmaltz also began being used in various non-traditional ways, such as cornbread, chicken pot pie, and other foods as a flavor enhancer.

==Process==

The manufacture of schmaltz involves cutting the fatty tissues of a bird (chicken or goose) into small pieces, melting the fat, and collecting the drippings. Schmaltz may be prepared by a dry process where the pieces are cooked under low heat and stirred, gradually yielding their fat. A wet process also exists whereby the fat is melted by direct steam injection. The rendered schmaltz is then filtered and clarified.

Homemade Jewish-style schmaltz is made by cutting chicken or goose fat into small pieces and melting in a pan over low-to-moderate heat, generally with onions. After the majority of the fat has been extracted, the melted fat is strained through a cheesecloth into a storage container. The remaining dark brown, crispy bits of skin and onion are known in Yiddish as &quot;gribenes&quot;.

Another simple method is as a by-product of the making of poultry soup, stock, or broth. After the chicken is simmered in the pot or crock-pot, the broth is chilled so the fat rises to the top. Then the fat can be skimmed off, at once providing schmaltz to set aside for other uses and a lower-fat broth that is heated before serving.

==Uses==
Schmaltz typically has a strong aroma, and therefore, often is used for hearty recipes such as stews or roasts. It is a key ingredient in Jewish soups such as chicken soup, as well as in matzo ball soup and some cholent. Sometimes it is used as a bread spread, where it may be salted. Generally, this is consumed on Jewish rye or challah breads. It may be used to prepare foods served as part of fleishig (meat) meals such as latkes, matzah brei, or potato kugel, or instead of butter when pan-frying potatoes, onions, or other foods.

== Vegetarian schmaltz ==
Various vegetarian (and consequently pareve) versions of schmaltz have been marketed, starting with Nyafat (U.S., Rokeach and Sons, 1924), which is largely coconut oil with some onion flavoring and color. Vegetable shortening also is used as a substitute. Vegetarian schmaltz was manufactured in South Africa from July 1951 under the brand Debra&#x27;s Schmalz, with Debra referring to Debora Bregman, who founded Debras Manufacturers. Production began in Debora&#x27;s kitchen at her home in Norwood before moving to a dedicated manufacturing facility and office. The slogan &quot;Even the chicken can&#x27;t tell the difference&quot; was added soon after production began. Debra&#x27;s Schmalz was eventually distributed across Southern Africa. The business was sold by the Bregman family in 1976, and Debra&#x27;s Schmalz continued to be manufactured and distributed. Chef Oded Schwartz discusses Debra&#x27;s Schmalz in his book &quot;In Search of Plenty — A History of Jewish Food&quot;. 

== Derived meanings ==
* Schmaltz herring means &#x27;fatty herring&#x27; and refers to the stage of development in the life cycle of herring when the fish contains the most fat, popular in Ashkenazi Jewish cookery, but it does not contain schmaltz.
* In American English, via Yiddish, &quot;schmaltz&quot; (adj. &quot;schmaltzy&quot;) also has an informal meaning of &#x27;excessively sentimental or florid music or art&#x27; or &#x27;maudlin sentimentality&#x27;, similar to one of the uses of the words &quot;corn&quot; or &quot;corny&quot;. Its earliest use in this sense dates to the mid-1930s. In German, &quot;schmalzig&quot; also is used in the same sense.
* Schmaltz and Schmalz are rare last names among people of German and Austrian descent. Schmaltz was used as a metonymic occupational name for a chandler.

<doc id="1093657" wikidata="Q5653073" url="?curid=1093657" title="Happy Town (album)">
<text>Happy Town is the third album by the American singer-songwriter Jill Sobule, released in 1997. The album contains the singles &quot;Bitter&quot; and &quot;When My Ship Comes In&quot; as well as &quot;Half a Heart&quot; and the satirical social commentary &quot;Soldiers of Christ&quot;, where Sobule sings from the point of view of a Christian Conservative to illustrate the existence of homophobia in religion. The album sold 24,000 copies in the US within the first year of its release.

&quot;Bitter&quot; peaked at No. 74 on the Australian ARIA singles chart in June 1997. The album peaked at No. 83 on the Australian ARIA albums chart during the same month. Sobule was dropped by Atlantic after the release of &quot;Happy Town&quot;.

The album cover illustration, which initially featured a Prozac pill, was changed to show a pair of test tubes when Wal-Mart refused to carry the album in its stores. The company asserted that the original image promoted drug abuse.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; called the album &quot;a bold step forward for a creatively expansive artist.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; called it &quot;a record to respect rather than appreciate,&quot; writing that &quot;many of the songs are fine, and she’s one of contemporary pop’s better observational songwriters, but the tone is unremittingly hostile.&quot; The &quot;Deseret News&quot; deemed it &quot;fun, liberal, spunky and sarcastic.&quot; &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that &quot;the title tune&#x27;s shift from cheesy, low-key organ to bright, power-pop guitar make it easy to understand the difference between the dull old world and life in that new, prozac-ed &#x27;Happy Town&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Kingston is a small town at the southernmost end of Lake Wakatipu, just north of the border of Otago and Southland, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is 47 kilometres south of Queenstown by a road, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Staircase&quot;, which winds between the lake to the west and The Remarkables mountains to the east. It is 70 kilometres north of Lumsden, and close to the headwaters of the Mataura River.

==History==
Kingston was originally named &#x27;St Johns&#x27; after police commissioner St. John Branigan.

<doc id="1093662" wikidata="Q7196073" url="?curid=1093662" title="Pink Pearl">
<text>Pink Pearl is the fourth album by American singer-songwriter Jill Sobule, released in 2000.

The record, whose name is both a model of pencil eraser by Eberhard Faber and a slang term for the clitoris, contains the singles &quot;One of These Days&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day Parade&quot;. The album peaked at No. 10 on CMJ&#x27;s Triple A radio airplay chart, and at No. 75 on CMJ&#x27;s Radio 200 chart in May 2000.

The album includes the satirical &quot;Heroes&quot;, which suggests that every potential hero turns out to be deeply flawed:

:William Faulkner drunk and depressed
:Dorothy Parker mean, drunk and depressed
:And that guy in &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; turned out to be a Nazi
:The founding fathers all had slaves
:The explorers slaughtered the braves
:The Old Testament God can be so petty

The album&#x27;s &quot;Mary Kay&quot; is a joking yet sympathetic take on Mary Kay Letourneau, the teacher who had sex with a 13-year-old student. &quot;Lucy at the Gym&quot; is a portrait of anorexia.

The song &quot;Mexican Wrestler&quot; was later covered by Emma Roberts on the Nickelodeon TV series &quot;Unfabulous&quot;, for which Sobule writes the music, and also appeared on Roberts&#x27; 2005 album &quot;Unfabulous and More: Emma Roberts&quot;. The track &quot;Rainy Day Parade&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the Ben Stiller film &quot;Mystery Men&quot;.

The track &quot;Rock Me to Sleep,&quot; co-written with Richard Barone, was featured on the television shows &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, and &quot;The West Wing&quot;. It was also covered by Sally Timms of the Mekons on her 1999 album, &quot;Cowboy Sally&#x27;s Twilight Laments for Lost Buckaroos&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Pompon&quot; (SS/SSR-267), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the pompon, an American fish of the &quot;Anisot&quot; family.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pompon&quot; was laid down by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on 26 November 1941; launched 15 August 1942, sponsored by Miss Katherine Mary Wolleson; and commissioned 17 March 1943.

== Service history ==
On 5 April 1943 &quot;Pompon&quot; began her voyage down the Mississippi River to New Orleans in a floating drydock. Stores were loaded at New Orleans and she sailed for the Pacific.

=== First war patrol, July – August 1943 ===

&quot;Pompon&quot; steamed from Brisbane, Australia on 10 July to conduct her first war patrol in the Truk area. Only a few days out, a Japanese submarine fired two torpedoes at her, both passing ahead. Besides patrolling off Truk, &quot;Pompon&quot; formed a scouting line with other submarines to cover 7th Fleet operations. On 25 July she seized the opportunity and torpedoed 5,871 ton cargo ship &quot;Thames Maru&quot;. In the same action two more attacks damaged a second transport and also a smaller transport. Numerous patrol boats and another enemy submarine were evaded, and Pompon returned to Brisbane 22 August.
=== Second war patrol, September – November 1943 ===

&quot;Pompon&quot; departed Brisbane on 12 September 1943 for her second war patrol, en route to a patrol area in the South China Sea north of Singapore. On 16 September, she sighted an Allied Liberty ship in the Coral Sea east of Grafton Passage in the Great Barrier Reef at at 04:05. The ship altered course directly toward her and she submerged. After &quot;Pompon&quot; returned to the surface, she unsuccessfully attempted to exchange recognition signals with the ship, which opened gunfire on her at a range of at 06:14. &quot;Pompon&quot; submerged again and suffered no damage.

After reaching her patrol area, &quot;Pompon&quot; made several unsuccessful attacks and experienced a near miss by a Japanese submarine. She returned to Fremantle, Australia on 5 November 1943 for supplies.
=== Third and fourth war patrols, November 1943 – April 1944 ===

The third patrol began on 29 November and again took her to the China Sea area off French Indo-China. After running Balabac Strait, where two radio-equipped Japanese motor sampans were sunk by gunfire, &quot;Pompon&quot; mined waters southwest of Cochin China. After a five-day sortie into the Celebes Sea, &quot;Pompon&quot; returned to Darwin for fuel, ending her patrol on 28 January 1944.

On 22 February, &quot;Pompon&quot; departed on her fourth patrol, and operated in the vicinity of Halmahera Island. She launched four torpedoes at three small Japanese escort vessels, but they ran under their targets due to the escorts&#x27; shallow draft. A contact was made in Roeang Passage, but upon closing, it proved to be a hospital ship. She made no further contacts and proceeded to Pearl Harbor via Ascension and Midway, arriving 10 April.

=== Fifth war patrol, May – June 1944 ===

After a refit and four days training, &quot;Pompon&quot; was again ready for sea. She departed Pearl Harbor on 6 May 1944 for a patrol off the coasts of Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Honshū. On 30 May she contacted a 742-ton cargo ship off Muroto Zaki. A submerged attack resulted in a hit directly under the rising sun flag amidships, breaking the ship in two. The &quot;Shiga Maru&quot; immediately sank. For the next seven hours &quot;Pompon&quot; was the target for five Japanese escorts and a portion of the air force, but she managed to crawl away from the scene at deep submergence. After covering the Tokyo Bay approaches for the Battle for Saipan, &quot;Pompon&quot; returned to Midway 25 June.

=== Sixth war patrol, July – September 1944 ===

On 19 July &quot;Pompon&quot; departed on her sixth and most successful patrol. Operating from the eastern coast of Honshū to the Sea of Okhotsk, she sank a 300-ton armed trawler with gunfire. Then on 12 August she spotted a Japanese convoy off the coast of Russian Sakhalin. In the wild night surface action which followed an 8,000-ton tanker was badly damaged by two torpedoes, 2,718-ton transport &quot;Mikage Maru No. 20&quot; was sunk, and a hit was possibly obtained on one of two hotly pursuing escort vessels. During this melee &quot;Pompon&quot; was almost sunk by one of her own torpedoes. While she was surfaced, with the enemy bearing down, one of her own &quot;fish&quot; perversely circled and just missed the stern. She was driven down by gunfire and then depth charged, but managed to escape without damage. She returned to Pearl Harbor 3 September for onward routing to San Francisco Bay for modernization and overhaul conducted at the Mare Island Navy Yard.

=== Seventh war patrol, December 1944 – February 1945 ===

By 13 December the veteran submarine was again at sea. En route to Majuro she picked up a Filipino who had been drifting in a broken down motor launch for 45 days. On 6 January 1945 she departed Majuro as a part of a wolf pack, for a patrol in the Yellow Sea. On 28 January she contacted a three ship convoy with four escorts off Kokuzan To. With in contact, the &quot;Pompon&quot; made two submerged night approaches only to have the alert escorts drive her off each time. While two escorts pinned her down astern of the convoy, &quot;Spadefish&quot; slipped in on the disengaged side and sank two of the ships and one of the escorts. &quot;Pompon&quot; surfaced in time to watch the sinkings and gave chase to the one remaining ship. Again she was deterred from attack by gunfire and a trailing escort.

The next morning, while making a morning trim dive, the conning tower hatch failed. Before the dive could be halted the ship had reached a depth of , partially flooding the conning tower and control room, and completely flooding the pump room. &quot;Pompon&quot; crept homeward, having to run awash until the blower could be partially restored. While struggling along in this condition, she blundered into an enemy convoy and was sighted. The escorts forced her to dive despite her dangerous condition, but she miraculously escaped. found her one day out of Midway and led her in on 11 February.

=== Eighth and ninth war patrols, March – July 1945 ===

Repairs completed, &quot;Pompon&quot; departed Midway 30 March for her eighth patrol area along the coasts of China and Formosa. Her only contacts, a motor sampan, a hospital ship, and 106 planes, provided excellent diving experience, but poor hunting. Ten survivors from a downed PBM were taken from for transportation to Guam, where &quot;Pompon&quot; arrived 24 May.

During her ninth, and last, war patrol from 18 June to 22 July, she operated as a lifeguard in the Truk area. There were no ship contacts and few plane contacts. She was at Guam when the news of the war&#x27;s end came. On 22 August she began her homeward voyage, arriving at New Orleans on 19 September.

=== Post-war service as radar picket ===

On 11 May 1946 &quot;Pompon&quot; was decommissioned and placed in the U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London. On 15 June 1953 she recommissioned as SSR-267, after being converted to the latest type radar picket submarine.

After a shakedown cruise to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, she reported to her new home port at Norfolk, Va. In November she departed for the Mediterranean where she operated with the 6th Fleet until 4 February 1954. In January 1955 she again left the Virginia Capes area, this time for the Caribbean, returning in March. &quot;Pompon&quot; returned to the Caribbean in February 1956. From 6 July to 3 October she operated in the Mediterranean.

During September and October 1957 &quot;Pompon&quot; participated in the large scale NATO exercise &quot;Strikeback&quot;, visiting the Clyde River, Scotland; Le Havre, France; and Portland, England. She continued to operate in the Atlantic and Caribbean until 17 June 1958 when she entered the Mediterranean, remaining there until September. Returning to Norfolk, she then operated off the east coast until placed in commission in reserve at Charleston 2 February 1959.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
Following decommissioning &quot;Pompon&quot; was struck from the Navy List 1 April 1960, and was sold to Commercial Metals Company for scrap on 25 November 1960.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Pompon&quot; earned four battle stars for World War II service.

==Commemoration==
One of &quot;Pompon&quot;′s propellers can be seen today on the river walk in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. It is one block north of the Torpedo Factory Art Center on a concrete slab in the water of the Potomac River.

<text>The Wannier functions are a complete set of orthogonal functions used in solid-state physics. They were introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. Wannier functions are the localized molecular orbitals of crystalline systems.

The Wannier functions for different lattice sites in a crystal are orthogonal, allowing a convenient basis for the expansion of electron states in certain regimes. Wannier functions have found widespread use, for example, in the analysis of binding forces acting on electrons.

==Definition==

Although, like localized molecular orbitals, Wannier functions can be chosen in many different ways, the original, simplest, and most common definition in solid-state physics is as follows. Choose a single band in a perfect crystal, and denote its Bloch states by
:formula_1
where &quot;u&quot;k(r) has the same periodicity as the crystal. Then the Wannier functions are defined by
:formula_2,
where
* R is any lattice vector (i.e., there is one Wannier function for each Bravais lattice vector);
* &quot;N&quot; is the number of primitive cells in the crystal;
* The sum on k includes all the values of k in the Brillouin zone (or any other primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice) that are consistent with periodic boundary conditions on the crystal. This includes &quot;N&quot; different values of k, spread out uniformly through the Brillouin zone. Since &quot;N&quot; is usually very large, the sum can be written as an integral according to the replacement rule:
:formula_3
where &quot;BZ&quot; denotes the Brillouin zone, which has volume Ω.

=== Properties ===

On the basis of this definition, the following properties can be proven to hold:

* For any lattice vector R&#x27; ,
:formula_4
In other words, a Wannier function only depends on the quantity (r − R). As a result, these functions are often written in the alternative notation
:formula_5

* The Bloch functions can be written in terms of Wannier functions as follows:
:formula_6,
where the sum is over each lattice vector R in the crystal.

* The set of wavefunctions formula_7 is an orthonormal basis for the band in question.
:formula_8

Wannier functions have been extended to nearly periodic potentials as well.

===Localization===

The Bloch states &quot;ψ&quot;k(r) are defined as the eigenfunctions of a particular Hamiltonian, and are therefore defined only up to an overall phase. By applying a phase transformation &quot;e&quot;&quot;iθ&quot;(k) to the functions &quot;ψ&quot;k(r), for any (real) function &quot;θ&quot;(k), one arrives at an equally valid choice. While the change has no consequences for the properties of the Bloch states, the corresponding Wannier functions are significantly changed by this transformation.

One therefore uses the freedom to choose the phases of the Bloch states in order to give the most convenient set of Wannier functions. In practice, this is usually the maximally-localized set, in which the Wannier function is localized around the point R and rapidly goes to zero away from R. For the one-dimensional case, it has been proved by Kohn that there is always a unique choice that gives these properties (subject to certain symmetries). This consequently applies to any separable potential in higher dimensions; the general conditions are not established, and are the subject of ongoing research.

A Pipek-Mezey style localization scheme has also been recently proposed for obtaining Wannier functions. Contrary to the maximally localized Wannier functions (which are an application of the Foster-Boys scheme to crystalline systems), the Pipek-Mezey Wannier functions do not mix σ and π orbitals.

====Rigorous results====

The existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions in insulators was proved mathematically in 2006.

==Modern theory of polarization==
Wannier functions have recently found application in describing the polarization in crystals, for example, ferroelectrics. The modern theory of polarization is pioneered by Raffaele Resta and David Vanderbilt. See for example, Berghold, and Nakhmanson, and a power-point introduction by Vanderbilt. The polarization per unit cell in a solid can be defined as the dipole moment of the Wannier charge density:
:formula_9
where the summation is over the occupied bands, and &quot;Wn&quot; is the Wannier function localized in the cell for band &quot;n&quot;. The &quot;change&quot; in polarization during a continuous physical process is the time derivative of the polarization and also can be formulated in terms of the Berry phase of the occupied Bloch states.

==Wannier interpolation==
Wannier functions are often used to interpolate bandstructures calculated &quot;ab initio&quot; on a coarse grid of k-points to any arbitrary k-point. This is particularly useful for evaluation of Brillouin-zone integrals on dense grids and searching of Weyl points, and also taking derivatives in the k-space. This approach is similar in spirit to the tight binding approximation, but in contrast allows for an exact description of bands in a certain energy range. Wannier interpolation schemes have been derived for spectral properties,
anomalous Hall conductivity,
orbital magnetization,
thermoelectric and electronic transport properties,
gyrotropic effects,
shift current,
spin Hall conductivity
and other effects.

<text>The Clink was a prison in Southwark, England, which operated from the 12th century until 1780. The prison served the Liberty of the Clink, a local manor area owned by the Bishop of Winchester rather than by the reigning monarch. As the Liberty owner, the Bishop kept all revenues from the Clink Liberty, and could put people in prison for failing to make their payments. As the Bishop, he could also imprison heretics. The Clink prison was situated next to the Bishop&#x27;s London-area residence of Winchester Palace. The Clink was possibly the oldest men&#x27;s prison and probably the oldest women&#x27;s prison in England.

It is uncertain whether the name of the prison derived from, or was bestowed on, the Liberty that it served. The origins of the name &quot;The Clink&quot; are possibly onomatopoeic, deriving from the sound of striking metal as the prison doors were bolted, or the rattling of the chains the prisoners wore.

The name has become slang as a generic term for prison or a jail cell.

==History==
There had been a prison owned by the Bishop of Winchester in one form or another since the year 860, although at that time it would only have been one cell in a priests&#x27; college. By 1076 an archbishop had several types of punishment allowed: scourging with rods; solitary confinement; and bread and water in silence.

The Bishop of Winchester, whose diocese was located in Hampshire on the southern coast of England, ordered the construction of the Winchester Palace chapel and mansion at the Southwark site to serve as a residence close to his London governmental duties, sometime after the acquisition of the manor territory between 1144 and 1149.

The prison was any number of structures within the mansion&#x27;s area whereby the local miscreants were kept to await trial. The higher status of some of its internees was solely due to the importance of the Bishop of Winchester as a senior member of the king&#x27;s government, usually as Lord Chancellor, who could also put to trial in his ecclesiastic court those accused of heresy and other religious offences.

As the gaolers were very poorly paid, they found other ways to supplement their income. This meant that prisoners with money and friends on the outside were able to pay the gaolers to make their time better. The gaolers hired out rooms, beds, bedding, candles and fuel to those who could afford it. Food and drink were charged at twice the outside price. They accepted payments for fitting lighter irons and for removing them completely. For a fee, prisoners would be allowed outside to beg or even to work. Madams were allowed to keep a brothel going, with payments going to the gaolers. Poorer prisoners had to beg at the grates that led up to street level and sell anything they had with them, including their clothes, to pay for food.

Winchester House was raided by rioters protesting the Statute of Labourers in 1450. Classing clerics as tax collectors, they murdered them and released prisoners from the Clink before burning it down. The rebellion was put down and Winchester House was rebuilt and extended, including a new prison.

Originally, most of the prisoners had been those who had broken the rules of the Liberty, but by the 16th century, it had become largely a prison for actual or supposed heretics who held contrary views to the bishops. The Marian martyrs John Bradford and John Hooper were amongst the inmates. In later years it was mainly a debtors&#x27; prison.

===Decline===
In 1649 Winchester House was sold to a property developer and was divided into shops, tenements and dye houses. The Cage was removed temporarily as taxpayers had complained about the cost of upkeep, but the whipping post was still busy. By 1707 both of these and the stocks were all unused because of the cost of upkeep, and by 1732 there were only two registered inmates. In 1745 a temporary prison was used, as the Clink was too decayed to use, but by 1776 the prison was again taking in debtors. It was burnt down in 1780 by Gordon rioters, and was never rebuilt.

===Today===
The Clink Prison Museum exhibition is located on Clink Street, near to the original site, at Bankside, Southwark. The Clink Prison Museum tries to recreate the conditions of the original prison.

<text>Seaburn is a seaside resort and northeastern suburb of Sunderland, North East England. The village of Whitburn borders the area to the north. To the west and south-west is Fulwell and to the south the coastal resort of Roker.

Virtually all of Seaburn consists of low-density private housing interspersed with open parkland, laid out in the middle of the 20th century. Much of the housing is amongst the most expensive in Sunderland, with many large mansion houses situated along the coast, and on adjoining streets.

The seafront is home to a sandy blue flag beach, seaside promenades, two amusement arcades, children&#x27;s playgrounds, fish and chip shops, small guest houses and two 4 star hotels, The Grand Hotel and the Seaburn Inn. The main shopping street is Sea Road, which runs from the seafront up through Fulwell to the Seaburn Metro station.

The area around Queens Parade hosts a &#x27;strip&#x27; of restaurants, with three Italian, two Indian and two Chinese restaurants in operation as of 2009. Also trading are several pubs and coffee shops. In the late 1980s, the old Seaburn Hall site was redeveloped, with a Morrisons supermarket, new amusement park and leisure and fitness centre. Previously, Seaburn Hall had been a dance hall and live music venue. It was built in 1939 as part of a development scheme which also included the seafront and a funfair.

Seaburn was a favourite place of the painter L. S. Lowry. A large Lowry painting is displayed in the local Morrisons supermarket.

The area was close to the Sunderland A.F.C. stadium Roker Park and was the origin of the hooligan firm the Seaburn Casuals.

The Sunderland International Airshow was held on the coast at Seaburn and Roker and was the largest free event of its kind in Europe, with a variety of aircraft, civilian and military aircraft on display.

On the Tyne and Wear Metro Seaburn is served by its own station.

The suburb is part of the Fulwell ward on Sunderland City Council, and is represented by three Conservative councillors.

<doc id="1093682" wikidata="Q3601003" url="?curid=1093682" title="All (Descendents album)">
<text>All is the fourth album by the American punk rock band the Descendents, released in 1987 through SST Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album with bassist Karl Alvarez and guitarist Stephen Egerton, who brought new songwriting ideas to the group. The album is titled after the concept of &quot;All&quot; invented by drummer Bill Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion in 1980. Based on the goals of achieving &quot;the total extent&quot; and &quot;to not settle for some, to always go for All&quot;, the philosophy was the subject of the one-second title track, the two-second &quot;No, All!&quot;, and &quot;All-O-Gistics&quot;.

&quot;All&quot; marked the end of the Descendents&#x27; original run. Following two tours of the United States to promote the album, singer Milo Aukerman left the group to pursue a career in biochemistry. The band was relaunched under the new name All, and released eight albums with other singers between 1988 and 1995, before reuniting with Aukerman under the Descendents name.

== Background ==

Following the Descendents&#x27; summer 1986 tour in support of their third album, &quot;Enjoy!&quot;, guitarist Ray Cooper and bassist Doug Carrion left the band. Seeking a new bassist, drummer Bill Stevenson contacted a musician he knew in Boise, Idaho. The musician declined but suggested Salt Lake City native Karl Alvarez, whose band the Bad Yodelers was staying with him at the time while on tour. Stevenson had met Alvarez in 1984 while touring with Black Flag, and invited him to try out with the Descendents. Packing all his belongings in a garbage bag, Alvarez took a train from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles and began rehearsing with Stevenson. According to singer Milo Aukerman, Alvarez and Stevenson &quot;just locked in completely.&quot; &quot;I think Billy and I had a certain connection,&quot; recalled Alvarez, &quot;but I can&#x27;t help but think &#x27;Well, yeah, because I practiced bass to his records.

Guitarist Stephen Egerton called to congratulate Alvarez on joining the Descendents; the two had been friends since 1976, learned to play guitar together, had played in the Salt Lake City hardcore punk band Massacre Guys, and were both big Descendents fans. Knowing the band needed a guitarist, Alvarez recommended Egerton, who was living in Washington, D.C. at the time. Stevenson also knew Egerton through touring; Egerton had been a tour promoter for Black Flag and the Minutemen when they had played Salt Lake City in 1984. Egerton came to Los Angeles and practiced with the band for a few days, officially joining on Stevenson&#x27;s birthday of September 10. After settling his affairs in Washington, D.C., he moved to Los Angeles that October. He and Alvarez moved into the Descendents&#x27; headquarters, a storefront along the Pacific Coast Highway in Lomita, California that housed the band&#x27;s living quarters, practice space, and office. Egerton later recalled:

For me, meeting Bill, beyond my massive love for the Descendents&#x27; music, was my massive love for Black Flag&#x27;s music, and he had been in both. So the idea that it was Karl, my oldest friend, and I joining this band that was so huge to us, it was like living on a cloud. We were like &quot;Uh, what just happened? Uh, we just joined the Descendents. This is gnarly.&quot;

After practicing for a few weeks, the Descendents headed out on the second &quot;Enjoy!&quot; tour from late November 1986 to mid-January 1987, playing small shows for little money and sleeping on people&#x27;s floors. &quot;Those first tours were very grueling in the way that it is when you&#x27;re not used to it&quot;, recalled Alvarez. On their return to Los Angeles they began writing songs for the band&#x27;s next album.

== Writing ==

As with previous Descendents albums, all four band members contributed to the songwriting of the new record. With their shared history and eclectic musical tastes, Alvarez and Egerton brought new ideas to the band. &quot;We already had a kind of highly evolved vocabulary of licks and riffs&quot;, recalled Alvarez. Egerton remembered &quot;What was interesting about putting that band together at that time was that there were two already functioning chemistries that existed: Milo and Bill, and me and Karl.&quot; &quot;They had all these really cool experimental, instrumental deals going&quot;, recalled Aukerman. &quot;Stephen came in with these crazy songs, this kind of King Crimson-eque thing, and I was like &#x27;ooh, okay.

Alvarez wrote &quot;Coolidge&quot;, which deals with a failed relationship and the realization that &quot;I&#x27;m not a cool guy anymore, as if I ever was before&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s proven to be one of our identifying songs&quot;, said Stevenson 26 years later, &quot;Here he is, new to the band, he walks in and writes one of the songs that would define us.&quot; Egerton&#x27;s contributions were primarily instrumental; he wrote the music for &quot;Impressions&quot;, &quot;Iceman&quot;, &quot;All-O-Gistics&quot;, and &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;, and co-wrote the music for &quot;Van&quot; and &quot;Uranus&quot;. &quot;Stephen harnessed the job of trying to expand some of the melodic boundaries&quot;, said Stevenson. &quot;He would kind of come up with what I would call the nasty chords.&quot;

Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Clean Sheets&quot; and he and Aukerman&#x27;s &quot;Pep Talk&quot; also dealt with themes of broken relationships. According to Stevenson, the chorus of &quot;Clean Sheets&quot; came to him fully formed one morning as he was waking up: Even though you&#x27;ll never come clean, you know it&#x27;s true / Those sheets are dirty, and so are you&#x27;, that was a complete thought: a melody, lyrics, and chords in my head. The way you hear it on the record, I heard that when I woke up. I didn&#x27;t strum around or plink around, it was just like &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s Clean Sheets&#x27;. It&#x27;s done.&quot; Aukerman&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Iceman&quot; were loosely based on the 1946 play &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; by Eugene O&#x27;Neill.
The album was titled after the concept of &quot;All&quot;, which Stevenson and his friend Pat McCuistion had invented during a fishing trip on Stevenson&#x27;s boat &quot;Orca&quot; in 1980. According to Aukerman, &quot;While drinking all this coffee in the midst of catching mackerel they came up with the concept of All — doing the utmost, achieving the utmost. The more they got into it the more it turned into their own religion; it&#x27;s partly humor, but it&#x27;s also an outlook on how to conduct your life: to not settle for some, to always go for All.&quot; Stevenson described the concept of &quot;All&quot; as &quot;the total extent&quot;, and he and McCuistion had quickly written several short songs &quot;in a fit of Allular frustration&quot;, two of which were recorded for &quot;All&quot;: &quot;All&quot; and &quot;No, All!&quot;. &quot;The songs were only seconds long, but that was all the time we needed to make the point&quot;, he said. McCuistion also shared writing credit on &quot;All-O-Gistics&quot;, a musical set of commandments for achieving All, such as &quot;Thou shalt not commit adulthood&quot;, &quot;Thou shalt not partake of decaf&quot;, and &quot;Thou shalt not suppress flatulence&quot;. &quot;Stephen had those chords, and I wrote my own religion for his chords&quot;, said Stevenson.

== Recording, artwork, and release ==
&quot;All&quot; was recorded in January 1987 at Radio Tokyo studios in Venice, Los Angeles with recording engineer Richard Andrews, who had recorded &quot;Enjoy!&quot; Stevenson served as record producer, and later said that of the Descendents&#x27; first five studio albums he felt only &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; (1982) came closer than &quot;All&quot; to authentically capturing the band&#x27;s sound. Dez Cadena of Black Flag and the DC3 sang backing vocals on the album. Stevenson created the cover graphics, while Alvarez provided illustrations for the sleeve and liner notes. One of Alvarez&#x27;s illustrations was of the &quot;Bassmaster General&quot;, a character previously mentioned in the &quot;Enjoy!&quot; song &quot;Kids&quot; who again turns up in the lyrics of &quot;All-O-Gistics&quot; as a higher power guiding the band in their quest for All.

The Descendents&#x27; previous albums had been released through New Alliance Records; however, following the death of label co-founder D. Boon New Alliance was sold to SST Records in 1987. SST released &quot;All&quot; and also re-released all of the Descendents&#x27; previous albums. &quot;All&quot; was released as an 11-song LP and a 13-song cassette and CD, the latter two containing the additional tracks &quot;Jealous of the World&quot; and &quot;Uranus&quot;.

== Supporting tours and Aukerman&#x27;s departure ==

The band supported the album with a 60-day spring 1987 tour from mid-February to mid-April that took them through the Southwestern and Southern United States, up the East Coast, into Canada to Montreal and Hamilton, then snaking westward through the Northern and Central United States before making their way northwest to Calgary and Vancouver, and finally down the West Coast of the United States back to Los Angeles; covering 29 states and 4 Canadian provinces with a total of 44 shows in 41 cities. This was followed by the 50-day summer &quot;FinALL&quot; tour from mid-May through the end of July, following much the same route and covering 28 states and 2 provinces, with 47 shows in 44 cities. Recordings of the band&#x27;s performances on April 9 at Berkeley Square in Berkeley, California and July 13 at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota were released as the live albums &quot;Liveage!&quot; (1987) and &quot;&quot; (1989).

The &quot;FinALL&quot; tour was so-called due to Aukerman&#x27;s decision to leave the band to pursue postgraduate education in microbiology. &quot;The band was fun, but I hadn&#x27;t achieved All, basically, in music or in science, and I had the opportunity to go try to achieve All more in science, and I decided to take that opportunity&quot;, he later reflected, adding that he had always considered music a hobby and science as his career, and &quot;the more the music started to seem like a career, the less I seemed to like it. In &#x27;87 I left the band and we did the final tour. There wasn&#x27;t one of these things like &#x27;Well, I&#x27;m gonna do this for a while and come back to the band.&#x27; It was more like &#x27;I&#x27;m embarking on my life&#x27;s career to do this. &quot;I toured him to death,&quot; said Stevenson. &quot;We did all those tours in a row and he&#x27;s like &#x27;I gotta go focus on my studies and do something real.&#x27; I mean, we were making five or ten dollars per day in our pocket and that&#x27;s it. We had nowhere to live, and you could see where a guy with the kind of brainpower he has would say &#x27;You know what? I don&#x27;t have to sleep next to Bill&#x27;s drum set in the practice room.

With Aukerman&#x27;s departure announced in advance, Stevenson took the opportunity to relaunch the band afresh under the name All with singer Dave Smalley, formerly of the Washington, D.C. hardcore band Dag Nasty, meaning for the new band to be the complete fulfillment of the &quot;All&quot; concept. &quot;I&#x27;ve been wanting to change the name of the band to ALL for eight years&quot;, he said during the FinALL tour, adding that it would not feel right to continue as the Descendents without Aukerman and that he wished to shelve the name in case he and Aukerman should wish to use it again at some point. On December 16, 1987, during the recording of the first All album &quot;Allroy Sez&quot;, Pat McCuistion died when his fishing boat sank during a storm. Stevenson remarked that &quot;He had 15,000 pounds of fish onboard, so I guess you could say he died in heated pursuit of All. He was always the &#x27;5th member&#x27; of the band, besides being my best friend, next to Milo.&quot; With Smalley and later singers Scott Reynolds and the Chad Price, All released eight albums between 1988 and 1995, with Aukerman contributing occasional songwriting and backing vocals. In 1995 Aukerman would return to record &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; with the band under the Descendents name.

== Reception ==
Mike DaRonco of AllMusic wrote: &quot;With this record, not only are they forgiven for the bad spots to be found on here — it&#x27;s not like they can&#x27;t be skipped over — but their last release (&quot;Enjoy!&quot;) will be forgotten.&quot; He remarked that the relationship-themed songs &quot;prove that the most creative music comes out of personal tragedy&quot; and called it a felony that &quot;Pep Talk&quot; was not included on the band&#x27;s 1991 &quot;best of&quot; compilation &quot;Somery&quot;. By contrast, DaRonco&#x27;s colleague Jason Ankeny referred to &quot;All&quot; as &quot;lackluster&quot; in his biography of the band. Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised several of the album&#x27;s songs as being among the Descendents&#x27; best work: &quot;&quot;All&quot; is often underrated because of the strange pseudo-arty instrumental tracks on its second half; nonetheless, the album features three of the band&#x27;s best songs, &#x27;Cameage&#x27;, &#x27;Coolidge&#x27;, and &#x27;Clean Sheets&#x27;. The subjects are perennial, but [the band&#x27;s] sophistication as lyricist[s] has grown. &#x27;Coolidge&#x27; is about accepting one&#x27;s uncoolness, and &#x27;Clean Sheets&#x27; talks of being forced to sleep on the floor after a lover&#x27;s infidelity sullies the sheets.&quot;

== Cover versions ==
In the decades since its release, several artists have recorded cover versions of songs from &quot;All&quot; for other releases. Swedish punk band Millencolin covered &quot;Coolidge&quot; on their &quot;Skauch&quot; EP (1994). For the Descendents tribute album &quot;Homage: Lots of Bands Doing Descendents&#x27; Songs&quot; (1995), Garden Variety covered &quot;Clean Sheets&quot;, Parasites covered &quot;Pep Talk&quot;, Peepshow covered &quot;Coolidge&quot;, the Teen Idols covered &quot;Cameage&quot;, and Meatjack covered &quot;Iceman&quot;. For &quot;Milo Turns 50: Songs of the Descendents&quot; (2013), The Henry Clay People covered &quot;Clean Sheets&quot;, Yacht covered &quot;All&quot; and Beatsteaks covered &quot;Clean Sheets&quot;.
