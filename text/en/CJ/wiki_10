<text>The Japanese term , from Portuguese &quot;cristão&quot; (cf. Kristang), meaning &quot;Christian&quot;, referred to Catholic Christians in Japanese and is used in Japanese texts as a historiographic term for Catholics in Japan in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Modern Japanese has several words for &quot;Christian&quot;, of which the most common are the noun form キリスト教徒, and also クリスチャン. The Japanese word キリシタン is used primarily in Japanese texts for the early history of Roman Catholicism in Japan, or in relation to &quot;Kakure Kirishitan&quot;, hidden Christians. However, English sources on histories of Japan generally use the term &quot;Christian&quot; without distinction.

Christian missionaries were known as (from the Portuguese word &quot;padre&quot;, &quot;father&quot; or &quot;priest&quot;) or (from the Portuguese &quot;irmão&quot;, &quot;brother&quot;). Contemptuous transcriptions such as 切支丹 and 鬼利死丹 (which use kanji with negative connotations) came into use during the Edo Period when Christianity was a forbidden religion. 

Portuguese ships began arriving in Japan in 1543, with Catholic missionary activities in Japan beginning in earnest around 1549, mainly by Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits until Spanish-sponsored mendicant orders, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans, gained access to Japan. No Western women came to Japan. Of the 95 Jesuits who worked in Japan up to 1600, 57 were Portuguese, 20 were Spaniards and 18 Italian. Francis Xavier, Cosme de Torres (a Jesuit priest), and João Fernandes were the first to arrive to Kagoshima with hopes to bring Christianity and Catholicism to Japan. At its height, Japan is estimated to have had around 300,000 Christians. Catholicism was subsequently repressed in several parts of the country and ceased to exist publicly in the 17th century.

== History ==

=== Background ===

==== Line of demarcations between Portugal and Spain ====

Religion was an integral part of the state and evangelization was seen as having both secular and spiritual benefits for both Portugal and Spain. Indeed, Pope Alexander VI&#x27;s Bulls of Donation (1493) commanded the Catholic Monarchs to take such steps. Wherever Spain and Portugal attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow. By the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade and colonization. Although, at the time of the demarcation, neither nation had any direct contact with Japan, that nation fell into the sphere of the Portuguese.

The countries disputed the allocation of Japan. Since neither could colonize it, the exclusive right to propagate Christianity in Japan meant the exclusive right to trade with Japan. Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits under Alessandro Valignano took the lead in proselytizing in Japan over the objection of the Spaniards, starting in 1579. The fait accompli was approved in Pope Gregory XIII&#x27;s papal bull of 1575, which decided that Japan belonged to the Portuguese Diocese of Macau. In 1588, the diocese of Funai (Nagasaki) was founded under Portuguese protection.

In rivalry with the Jesuits, Spanish-sponsored mendicant orders entered into Japan via Manila. In addition to criticizing Jesuit activities, they actively lobbied the Pope. Their campaigns resulted in Pope Clement VIII&#x27;s decree of 1600, which allowed Spanish friars to enter Japan via the Portuguese Indies, and Pope Paul V&#x27;s decree of 1608, which abolished the restrictions on the route. The Portuguese accused Spanish Jesuits of working for their homeland instead of their religion. The power struggle between Jesuits and mendicant orders caused a schism within the diocese of Funai. Furthermore, mendicant orders tried in vain to establish a diocese on the Tōhoku region that was to be independent from the Portuguese one.

The Roman Catholic world order was challenged by the Netherlands and England. Its principle was repudiated by Grotius&#x27;s &quot;Mare Liberum&quot;. In the early 17th century, Japan built trade relations with the Netherlands and England. Although England withdrew from the operations within ten years under James I due to a lack of profitability, the Netherlands continued to trade with Japan and became the only European country that maintained trade relations with Japan until the 19th century. As trade competitors, the Protestant countries engaged in a campaign against Catholicism, and this subsequently adversely affected shogunate policies toward the Iberian kingdoms.

Portugal&#x27;s and Spain&#x27;s colonial policies were also challenged by the Roman Catholic Church itself. The Vatican founded the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide in 1622 and attempted to separate the churches from the influence of the Iberian kingdoms. However, it was too late for Japan. The organization failed to establish staging points in Japan.

=== Propagation strategy ===

The Jesuits believed that it was better to seek to influence people in power and then allow the religion to be passed downwards to the commoners later. They tried to avoid suspicion by not preaching to the commoners without permission from the local rulers to propagate Catholicism within their domains. As a result, several &quot;daimyō&quot; became Christians, soon to be followed by many of their subjects as the Dominicans and Augustinians were able to begin preaching to the commoners. After the edict banning Christianity, there were communities that kept practicing Catholicism without having any contact with the Church until missionaries were able to return much later.

When Xavier disembarked in Kagoshima, the principal chiefs of the two branches of the Shimazu family, Sanehisa and Katsuhisa, were warring for the sovereignty of their lands. Katsuhisa adopted Shimazu Takahisa who in 1542 was accepted as head of the clan having previously received the Portuguese merchants on Tanegashima Island, learning about the use of firearms. Later, he met Xavier himself at the castle of Uchiujijo and permitted the conversion of his vassals.
Having a religious background, Takahisa showed himself to be benevolent and already allowed freedom of worship but not helping the missionaries nor favoring their church. Failing to find a way to the centre of affairs, the court of the Emperor, Xavier soon tired and left to Yamaguchi thus beginning the Yamaguchi period. Xavier stayed in Yamaguchi for two months on his way to an abortive audience with the Emperor in Kyoto. Yamaguchi was already a prosperous and refined city and its leaders, the Ōuchi family, were aware that Xavier&#x27;s journey to Japan had begun after the completion of his mission in India.

They took Catholicism for some sort of new sect of Buddhism and were curious to know of the priest&#x27;s doctrine. Tolerant but shrewd, their eyes less on baptism than the Portuguese cargoes from Macao, they granted the Jesuit permission to preach. The uncompromising Xavier took to the streets of the city denouncing, among other things, infanticide, idolatry and homosexuality.

Christian books were published in Japanese from the 1590s on, some with more than one thousand copies, and from 1601 a printing press was established under the supervision of Soin Goto Thomas, a citizen of Nagasaki, with thirty Japanese working full-time at the press. Liturgical calendars were also printed after 1592 until at least 1634. Christian solidarity made possible missionary mail delivery throughout the country until the end of the 1620s.

=== Early Christian community ===

Different groups of laymen supported Christian life in the Japanese mission, e.g., dōjuku, kanbō and jihiyakusha helped the clergymen in activities like the celebration of Sunday liturgy in the absence of ordained clergy, religious education, preparation of confessions, and 
spiritual support of the sick. By the end of the 16th century kanbō and jihiyakusha had similar responsibilities and also organized funerals and baptized children with permission to baptize from Rome. The kanbō were those who had left secular life but not taken formal vows, while the jihiyakusha were married and had a profession.

These groups were fundamental to the mission, and themselves depended on both the ecclesiastical hierarchy as well as the warlords who controlled the lands where they lived. Therefore, the success of the Japanese mission cannot be explained only as the result of the action of a brilliant group of missionaries, or of the commercial and political interests of a few &quot;daimyōs&quot; and traders.

At the same time the missionaries faced the hostility of many other &quot;daimyōs&quot;. Christianity challenged Japanese civilization. A militant lay community, the main reason for missionary success in Japan, was also the main reason for the anti-Christian policy of the Tokugawa&#x27;s bakufu.

=== Economic activities ===
The Jesuits in Japan had to maintain economic self-sufficiency because they could not expect stable and sufficient payment from their patron, the King of Portugal, but the king allowed the Jesuits to engage in trade with Japan. Such economic activity can be found in the work of Francis Xavier, the pioneer of Catholic missions in Japan, who covered the cost of missionary work through merchant trading. From the 1550s to the 1570s, the Jesuits covered all necessary expenses with trade profits and bought land in India.

Their officially recognized commercial activity was a fixed-amount entry into the Portuguese silk trade between Macau and Nagasaki. They financed to a certain amount the trade association in Macau, which purchased raw silk in Canton and sold it in Nagasaki. They did not confine their commercial activity to the official silk market but expanded into unauthorized markets. For the Macau-Nagasaki trade, they dealt in silk fabrics, gold, musk and other goods including military supplies and slavery. Sometimes, they even got involved in Spanish trade, prohibited by the kings of Spain and Portugal, and antagonizing the Portuguese traders.

It was mainly procurators who brokered Portuguese trade. They resided in Macau and Nagasaki, and accepted purchase commitments by Japanese customers such as the shogunate &quot;daimyō&quot; and wealthy merchants. By brokerage, the Jesuits could expect not only rebates but also favorable treatment from the authorities. For this reason, the office of procurator became an important post amongst the Jesuits in Japan. Although trade activities by the Jesuits ate into Portuguese trade interests, procurators continued their brokerage utilizing the authority of the Catholic Church. At the same time, Portuguese merchants required the assistance of procurators who were familiar with Japanese customs, since they established no permanent trading post in Japan. Probably the most notable procurator was João Rodrigues, who approached Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu and even participated in the administration of Nagasaki.

Such commercial activities were contrary to the idea of honorable poverty that the priests held. But some Jesuits at this time placed the expansion of the society&#x27;s influence before this ideal. Mendicant orders fiercely accused the Jesuits of being corrupt and even considered their activity as the primary reason for Japan&#x27;s ban on Catholicism. Mendicant orders themselves were not necessarily uninvolved in commercial activities.

=== Military activities ===

Missionaries were not reluctant to take military action if they considered it an effective way to Christianize Japan. They often associated military action against Japan with the conquest of China. They thought that well-trained Japanese soldiers who had experienced long civil wars would help their countries conquer China. For example, Alessandro Valignano said to the Philippine Governor that it was impossible to conquer Japan because the Japanese were very brave and always received military training but that Japan would benefit them when they would conquer China. Francisco Cabral also reported to the King of Spain that priests were able to send to China two or three thousand Japanese Christian soldiers who were brave and were expected to serve the king with little pay.

The Jesuits provided various kinds of support including military support to Kirishitan &quot;daimyōs&quot; when they were threatened by non-Kirishitan &quot;daimyōs&quot;. Most notable was their support of Ōmura Sumitada and Arima Harunobu, who fought against the anti-Catholic Ryuzoji clan. In the 1580s, Valignano believed in the effectiveness of military action and fortified Nagasaki and Mogi. In 1585, Gaspar Coelho asked the Spanish Philippines to send a fleet but the plan was rejected due to the shortness of its military capability. Christians Arima Harunobu and Paulo Okamoto were named as principals in an assassination plot to murder the magistrate in charge of the Shogunate&#x27;s most important port city of Nagasaki.

=== Early policy toward Catholicism ===

When the Jesuit priest Francis Xavier arrived, Japan was experiencing a nationwide civil war. Neither the emperor nor the Ashikaga shogun could exercise power over the nation. At first, Xavier planned to gain permission for building a mission from the emperor but was disappointed with the devastation of the imperial residence. The Jesuits approached &quot;daimyōs&quot; in southwestern Japan and succeeded in converting some of these &quot;daimyōs&quot;. One reason for their conversion may have been the Portuguese trade in which the Jesuits acted as brokers. The Jesuits recognized this and approached local rulers with offers of trade and exotic gifts.

The Jesuits attempted to expand their activity to Kyoto and the surrounding regions. In 1559, Gaspar Vilela obtained permission from Ashikaga Yoshiteru to teach Christianity. This license was the same as those given to Buddhist temples, so special treatment cannot be confirmed regarding the Jesuits. On the other hand, Emperor Ōgimachi issued edicts to ban Catholicism in 1565 and 1568. The orders of the Emperor and the Shogun made little difference.

Christians refer positively to Oda Nobunaga, who died in the middle of the unification of Japan. He favored the Jesuit missionary Luís Fróis and generally tolerated Christianity. But overall, he undertook no remarkable policies toward Catholicism. Actually, Catholic power in his domain was trivial because he did not conquer western Japan, where the Jesuits were based. By 1579, at the height of missionary activity, there were about 130,000 converts.

=== Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the Christian &quot;daimyōs&quot; ===


The situation was changed when Toyotomi Hideyoshi reunified Japan. Once he became the ruler of Japan, Hideyoshi began to pay attention to external threats, particularly the expansion of European power in East Asia. The turning point for Catholic missions was the San Felipe incident, where in an attempt to recover his cargo, the Spanish captain of a shipwrecked trading vessel claimed that the missionaries were there to prepare Japan for conquest. These claims made Hideyoshi suspicious of the foreign religion. He attempted to curb Catholicism while maintaining good trading relations with Portugal and Spain, which might have provided military support to Dom Justo Takayama, a Christian &quot;daimyō&quot; in western Japan. Many &quot;daimyōs&quot; converted to Christianity in order to gain more favorable access to saltpeter, used to make gunpowder. Between 1553 and 1620, eighty-six &quot;daimyōs&quot; were officially baptized, and many more were sympathetic to the Christians.

By 1587, Hideyoshi had become alarmed by reports that Christian lords oversaw forced conversions of retainers and commoners, that they had garrisoned the city of Nagasaki, that they participated in the slave trade of other Japanese and, apparently offending Hideyoshi&#x27;s Buddhist sentiments, that they allowed the slaughter of horses and oxen for food. After his invasion of Kyushu, Hideyoshi Toyotomi promulgated the on July 24, 1587. It consists of 11 articles: &quot;No. 10. Do not sell Japanese people to the Nanban (Portuguese).&quot; Among the contents were a ban on missionaries. The Jesuits in Nagasaki considered armed resistance, but the plans did not come to fruition. Led by Coelho, they sought help from Kirishitan &quot;daimyōs&quot;, but the &quot;daimyōs&quot; refused. Then they called for a deployment of reinforcements from their homeland and its colonies, but this plan was abolished by Valignano. Like the Kirishitan &quot;daimyōs&quot;, he realized that a military campaign against Japan&#x27;s powerful ruler would bring catastrophe to Catholicism in Japan. Valignano survived the crisis by laying all the blame on Coelho, and in 1590, the Jesuits decided to stop intervening in the struggles between the &quot;daimyōs&quot; and to disarm themselves. They only gave secret shipments of food and financial aid to Kirishitan &quot;daimyōs&quot;.

However, the 1587 decree was not particularly enforced. In contrast to the Jesuits, the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Augustinians were openly preaching to the common peoples; this caused Hideyoshi to become concerned that commoners with divided loyalties might lead to dangerous rebels like the &quot;Ikkō-ikki&quot; sect of earlier years; this led to Hideyoshi putting the 26 Martyrs of Japan followers to death in 1597 on his order. After Hideyoshi died in 1598, amidst the chaos of succession there was less of a focus on persecuting Christians.

=== Expansion ===

By the end of the 16th century, the Japanese mission had become the largest overseas Christian community that was not under the rule of a European power. Its uniqueness was emphasized by Alessandro Valignano since 1582, who promoted a deeper accommodation of Japanese culture. Japan was then the sole overseas country in which all members of those confraternities were locals, as was the case with Christian missions in Mexico, Peru, Brazil, the Philippines, or India, in spite of the presence of a colonial elite.

Most Japanese Christians lived in Kyushu, but Christianization was not a regional phenomenon and had a national impact. By the end of the 16th century it was possible to find baptized people in virtually every province of Japan, many of them organized in communities. On the eve of the Sekigahara battle, fifteen &quot;daimyōs&quot; were baptized, and their domains stretched from Hyūga in Southeast Kyushu to Dewa in North Honshū. Hundreds of churches had been built throughout Japan.

Accepted on a national scale, Christianity was also successful among different social groups from the poor to the rich, peasants, traders, sailors, warriors, or courtesans. Most of the daily activities of the Church were done by Japanese from the beginning, giving the Japanese Church a native face, and this was one of the reasons for its success. By 1590, there were seventy native brothers in Japan, fully one half of Jesuits in Japan, and fifteen percent of all Jesuits who were working in Asia.

In June 1592, Hideyoshi invaded Korea; among his leading generals was Christian &quot;daimyō&quot; Konishi Yukinaga. The actions of his forces in the massacre and enslavement of many of the Korean people were indistinguishable from the non-Christian Japanese forces that participated in the invasion. After Konishi&#x27;s loss in the battle of Sekigahara, Konishi would base his refusal to commit seppuku on his Christian beliefs; instead of taking his own life, he chose capture and execution.

The 1592 war between Japan and Korea also provided Westerners with a rare opportunity to visit Korea. Under orders of Gomaz, the Jesuit Gregorious de Cespedes arrived in Korea with a Japanese monk for the purpose of administering to the Japanese troops. He stayed there for approximately 18 months, until April or May 1595, thus being on record as the first European missionary to visit the Korean peninsula, but was unable to make any inroads. The &quot;Annual Letters of Japan&quot; made a substantial contribution to the introduction of Korea to Europe, Francis Xavier having crossed paths with Korean envoys dispatched to Japan during 1550 and 1551.

The Japanese missions were economically self-sufficient. Nagasaki&#x27;s misericórdias became rich and powerful institutions which every year received large donations. The brotherhood grew in numbers to over 100 by 1585 and 150 in 1609. Controlled by the elite of Nagasaki, and not by Portuguese, it had two hospitals (one for lepers) and a large church. By 1606, there already existed a feminine religious order called Miyako no Bikuni (&quot;nuns of Kyoto&quot;) which accepted Korean converts such as Marina Pak, baptized in Nagasaki. Nagasaki was called &quot;the Rome of Japan&quot; and most of its inhabitants were Christians. By 1611, it had ten churches and was divided into eight parishes including a specifically Korean order.

=== Tokugawa response ===

Following Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu assumed power over Japan in 1600. Like Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he disliked Christian activities in Japan but gave priority to trade with Portugal and Spain. He secured Portuguese trade in 1600. He negotiated with Manila to establish trade with the Philippines. The trade promotion made his policies toward Catholicism inconsistent. At the same time, in an attempt to wrest control of the Japan trade from the Catholic countries, Dutch and English traders advised the Shogunate that Spain did indeed have territorial ambitions, and that Catholicism was Spain&#x27;s principal means. The Dutch and English promised, in distinction, that they would limit themselves to trading and would not conduct missionary activities in Japan.

It seems that the Jesuits realized that the Tokugawa shogunate was much stronger and more stable than Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s administration, yet the mendicant orders discussed military options relatively openly. In 1615, a Franciscan emissary of the Viceroy of New Spain asked the shogun for land to build a Spanish fortress and this deepened Japan&#x27;s suspicion against Catholicism and the Iberian colonial powers behind it. The Jesuits and the Mendicant Orders kept a lasting rivalry over the Japanese mission and attached to different imperial strategies.

====Early persecution ====
The Tokugawa shogunate finally decided to ban Catholicism. The statement on the &quot;Expulsion of all missionaries from Japan&quot;, drafted by Zen monk Konchiin Suden (1563–1633) and issued in 1614 under the name of second shogun Hidetada (ruled 1605–1623), was considered the first official statement of a comprehensive control of Kirishitan. It claimed that the Christians were bringing disorder to Japanese society and that their followers &quot;contravene governmental regulations, traduce Shinto, calumniate the True Law, destroy regulations, and corrupt goodness&quot;. It was fully implemented and canonized as one of the fundamental Tokugawan laws. In the same year, the bakufu required all subjects of all domains to register at their local Buddhist temple; this would become an annual requirement in 1666, cementing the Buddhist temples as an instrument of state control.

The immediate cause of the prohibition was the Okamoto Daihachi incident, a case of fraud involving Ieyasu&#x27;s Catholic vavasor, but there were also other reasons behind it. The shogunate was concerned about a possible invasion by the Iberian colonial powers, which had previously occurred in the New World and the Philippines. Domestically, the ban was closely related to measures against the Toyotomi clan. 
The Buddhist ecclesiastical establishment was made responsible for verifying that a person was not a Christian through what became known as the &quot;temple guarantee system&quot; (terauke seido). By the 1630s, people were being required to produce a certificate of affiliation with a Buddhist temple as proof of religious orthodoxy, social acceptability and loyalty to the regime.

In the mid-17th century, the shogunate demanded the expulsion of all European missionaries and the execution of all converts. This marked the end of open Christianity in Japan. The bakufu erected bulletin boards nationwide at crossroads and bridges; among the many proscriptions listed on these boards were strict warnings against Christianity.

The systematic persecution beginning in 1614 faced stiff resistance from Christians, despite the departure of more than half the clergy. Once again, the main reason for this resistance was not the presence of a few priests but rather the self-organization of many communities. Forced to secrecy, and having a small number of clergymen working underground, the Japanese Church was able to recruit leadership from among lay members. Japanese children caused admiration among the Portuguese and seem to have participated actively in the resistance. Nagasaki remained a Christian city in the first decades of the 17th century and during the general persecutions other confraternities were founded in Shimabara, Kinai and Franciscans in Edo.

The number of active Christians is estimated to have been around 200,000 in 1582. There were likely around 1,000 known martyrs during the missionary period. In contrast, Christians attach a great importance to martyrdom and persecution, noting that countless more people were dispossessed of their land and property leading to their subsequent death in poverty.
The Japanese government used &quot;fumi-e&quot; to reveal practicing Catholics and sympathizers. &quot;Fumi-e&quot; were pictures of the Virgin Mary or Christ. People reluctant to step on the pictures were identified as Christian and taken to Nagasaki. If they refused to renounce their religion, they were tortured; those who still refused were executed.

====Later persecution ====
The Shimabara Rebellion, led by a young Christian man named Amakusa Shirō Tokisada, took place against the shogunate in 1637. The rebellion broke out over economic desperation and government oppression but later assumed a religious tone. About 27,000 people joined the uprising, but it was crushed by the shogunate after a sustained campaign. The reigning shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, who had issued the Sakoku Edict, restricting trade and effectively isolating Japan, two years earlier, came down hard on the Christians. Many Japanese were deported to Macau or to Spanish Philippines. Many Macanese and Japanese-Filipino Mestizos are the mixed-race descendants of the deported Japanese Catholics. About 400 were officially deported by the government to Macau and Manila, but thousands of Japanese were pressured into moving voluntarily. About 10,000 Macanese and 3,000 Japanese were moved to Manila.

The Catholic remnant in Japan were driven underground, and its members became known as the &quot;Hidden Christians&quot;. Some priests remained in Japan illegally, including 18 Jesuits, seven Franciscans, seven Dominicans, one Augustinian, five seculars and an unknown number of Jesuit &quot;irmao&quot; and &quot;dojuku&quot;. Since this time corresponds to the Thirty Years&#x27; War between Catholics and Protestants in Germany, it is possible that the checking of Catholic power in Europe reduced the flow of funds to the Catholic missions in Japan, which could be why they failed at this time and not before. During the Edo period, the Kakure Kirishitans kept their faith. Biblical phrases or prayers were transferred orally from parent to child, and secret posts (mizukata) were assigned in their underground community to baptize their children, all while regional governments continuously operated &quot;fumi-e&quot; to expose Christians.

=== Rediscovery and return ===

Japan was forced to open to foreign interaction by Matthew Perry in 1853. It became possible for foreigners to live in Japan with the Harris Treaty in 1858. Many Christian clergymen were sent from Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox churches, though proselytizing was still banned. In 1865, some of the Japanese who lived in Urakami village near Nagasaki visited the new Ōura Church which had been built by the Paris Foreign Missions Society (Missions étrangères de Paris) barely a month before. A female member of the group spoke to a French priest, Bernard Petitjean, and confessed that their families had kept the Kirishitan faith. Those Kirishitan wanted to see the statue of St. Mary with their own eyes, and to confirm that the priest was single and truly came from the pope in Rome. After this interview, many Kirishitan thronged toward Petitjean. He investigated their underground organizations and discovered that they had kept the rite of baptism and the liturgical years without European priests for nearly 250 years. Petitjean&#x27;s report surprised the Christian world; Pope Pius IX called it a miracle.

The Edo Shogunate&#x27;s edicts banning Christianity were still on the books, however, and thus the religion continued to be persecuted up to 1867, the last year of its rule. Robert Bruce Van Valkenburgh, the American minister-resident in Japan, privately complained of this persecution to the Nagasaki magistrates, though little action was taken to stop it. The succeeding government under Emperor Meiji, who took over from the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, initially continued in this vein and several thousand people were exiled (Urakami Yoban Kuzure). After Europe and the U.S. began to vocally criticize the persecution, the Japanese government realized that it needed to lift the ban in order to attain its interests. In 1873 the ban was lifted. Numerous exiles returned and began construction of the Urakami Cathedral, which was completed in 1895.

It was later revealed that tens of thousands of Kirishitan still survived in some regions near Nagasaki. Some officially returned to the Roman Catholic Church. Others remained apart from the Catholic Church and have stayed as Kakure Kirishitan, retaining their own traditional beliefs and their descendants asserting that they keep their ancestors&#x27; religion. However, it became difficult for them to keep their community and rituals, so they have converted to Buddhism or Shinto eventually. When John Paul II visited Nagasaki in 1981, he baptized some young people from Kakure Kirishitan families, a rare occurrence.

==Christian view of Kirishitan history ==
Those who participated in the Shimabara Rebellion are not considered to be martyrs by the Catholic Church since they took up arms for materialistic reasons.

Drawn from the oral histories of Japanese Catholic communities, Shūsaku Endō&#x27;s novel &quot;Silence&quot; provides detailed portrayals of the persecution of Christian communities and the suppression of the Church. The novel has two film adaptations, in 1971 and in 2016.

==Kirishitan grave in Minamishimabara==
A gravestone was discovered in Nishiarie-machi, Minamishimabara, Nagasaki in 1929. It is located in a seaside communal cemetery on the southern coast of the Shimabara Peninsula, overlooking Amakusa Sea to the south. It is a semi-cylindrical &quot;kamaboko&quot; shape with a total length of 1.21 meters, width of 0.56 meters, and height of 0.39 meters, made of sandstone from Amakusa, commonly known as &quot;Amakusa stone&quot;. A cross is engraved on the top and front of the monument, and the back is engraved in Roman letters with the words &quot;Hiri (Hori) Sakuemon Diego, 83 years old since birth, October 16, 1610, Keicho 15,&quot; making it the oldest inscription in Roman letters in Japan. Of the approximately known 150 &quot;Kirishitan&quot; gravestones in Japan, about 130 are on the Shimabara Peninsula, but after the Shimabara Rebellion, &quot;Shugendō&quot; became popular among the people who migrated to the peninsula, and many of the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; gravestones were spared destruction as they were believed by the newcomers to be graves of early mountain priests. The tombstone is now protected by a glass-walled structure, and was designated a National Historic Site for its importance in understanding the state of Christian missionary work in the early Edo period.

<text>Robert Malcolm (born 12 November 1980 in Glasgow) is a Scottish former football player and coach.

Malcolm played as a centre-back or defensive midfielder for Rangers, Derby County, Queens Park Rangers (on loan), Motherwell, Brisbane Roar, Dundee and Cowdenbeath. He also represented Scotland in under-21 and &#x27;B&#x27; team international matches.

Since retiring as a player, Malcolm has worked as a coach. He assisted Barry Ferguson during his time as manager of Blackpool and Clyde.

==Playing career==
===Rangers===
He began his career playing for Scottish Premier League team Rangers, either as a centre back or a defensive midfielder. A graduate of the club&#x27;s youth system, Malcolm played 115 games (three goals) in all competitions across his seven years as a senior player at Rangers, winning four major honours (two league titles, a Scottish Cup and a Scottish League Cup).

In May 2004, Malcolm was fined £5,000 after signing &quot;FTP&quot; (an acronym depicting &quot;Fuck The Pope&quot;) alongside an autograph for a fan. Anti-sectarian charity Nil by Mouth made Rangers aware of the incident which took place at a private club function. In November 2004, Malcolm was sent-off from the dug-out at Ibrox Stadium and escorted to the dressing room by two police officers for making what was reported to have been obscene gestures towards fans of rival Scottish club Celtic, during an Old Firm derby. However, he did return to the bench later in the match.

Despite playing 17 times for Rangers during season 2005–06 under Alex McLeish, he was not in the plans of new manager Paul Le Guen for the new season and was left out of the squad&#x27;s pre-season trip to South Africa. He had been linked with moves to Dundee United, Ipswich Town, Coventry City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Preston North End and Millwall before being released by Rangers on 31 August 2006.

===Derby County===
Malcolm signed for Derby County on 6 September. He played a part in The Rams promotion to the English Premier League, but injuries hampered his progress at the Derby and on 16 November 2007 he joined Championship club Queens Park Rangers on loan until 1 January 2008, where he joined up with ex-Derby teammates Lee Camp and Adam Bolder.

On 28 December 2007, Malcolm was suspended by Derby County after he was charged by police with a drink driving offence, although he was playing for QPR at the time. The charge related to an alleged incident on the M1 motorway in Derbyshire the previous morning. He was bailed to appear before Chesterfield Magistrates Court on 16 January 2008. During this hearing the case was adjourned until 29 January. After the adjournment Malcolm admitted to being unfit to drive through drink and he was subsequently banned from driving. On 31 January 2008 Malcolm had his Derby County contract paid up by manager Paul Jewell, after playing only 14 games for The Rams, with one Premier League appearance in a 6–0 defeat at Liverpool.

===Motherwell===
Reports in February 2008 had linked him with a move to FC Dallas, but, after failing a fitness test, he instead opted to join Scottish Premier League side Motherwell on 26 February 2008, signing a contract until the end of the 2007–08 season. Malcolm then signed a further one-year deal with the club on 10 July 2008.

===Brisbane Roar===
Malcolm signed for Queensland-based A-League team Brisbane Roar in July 2009 where former Rangers teammates Craig Moore and Charlie Miller played at the time. He was released by the Roar after the team started a rebuilding phase under new coach Ange Postecoglou.

===Dundee===
In March 2010, Malcolm moved back to Scotland, with First Division hopefuls Dundee. Having made three appearances for Dundee he was released by the club on 4 May 2010, along with 8 other players.

===Cowdenbeath===
Malcolm signed for Cowdenbeath in March 2011. He was released in May 2011 following Cowdenbeath&#x27;s relegation to the Second Division. After missing a year through injury, Malcolm trained with East Fife in July 2012. However, ultimately he never played for another senior club.

===International===
Malcolm made appearances for both Scotland U21 and Scotland B. He was also called up to the senior Scotland team in February 2003 but was ultimately never capped at that level.

==Coaching career==
Malcolm was appointed to a coaching position at Blackpool in January 2014, working for his former Rangers teammate Barry Ferguson. In a match against Burnley in April 2014, Malcolm was filmed pushing Blackpool player Stephen Dobbie in the face. Ferguson subsequently admitted that tensions were a &quot;bit high&quot;. Blackpool avoided relegation from the Football League Championship, but Ferguson and Malcolm left the club at the end of the 2013–14 season.

Ferguson was appointed manager of Scottish League Two club Clyde and in June 2014 recruited Malcolm to be a coach. Malcolm was promoted to the position of assistant manager at Clyde in August 2014. After Ferguson resigned on 26 February, Malcolm took caretaker charge of one match.

In October 2017, Malcolm was seen operating an ice cream van in Glasgow&#x27;s Barlanark neighbourhood, filling in for a relative who owned the operation.

Malcolm was the assistant manager of Kelty Hearts, working under Barry Ferguson, up until 2021, when Ferguson was appointed as manager of Alloa Athletic.

<text>Elizabeth Audrey Gordon (born 8 September 1955) is a former New Zealand politician. She was an MP from 1996 to 2002, representing the Alliance.

==Early life==

Elizabeth Audrey Gordon (known as Liz) was born in Preston, England, on 8 September 1955, but brought up in the south of England from the age of one. Her parents split up when she was seven, and she and her sister, Christine, spent a number of years at King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley, Surrey, as boarding pupils. Gordon left school at 15 and moved to London, where she worked for a year and met her first husband, a New Zealander. She moved to New Zealand in September 1972, still aged 16. She married in 1974 and had her daughter, Sonya, in 1976.

==Tertiary education==

===Tertiary study===

Before and after the birth of her daughter, Gordon became increasingly housebound with severe agoraphobia. It was suggested to her that she go to university to resume her education. She enrolled as an adult student in 1979 at Massey University in Palmerston North. She did a BA in psychology and education, earning a Massey scholarship in 1982, completed a Master of Arts with first class honours in 1983, and a PhD in Education in 1989.

===Lectureship===
In 1990 she took up a lectureship at the University of Canterbury. She has held a number of honours and awards, including a doctoral scholarship, a Fulbright Travel Award, a Claude McCarthy fellowship and a Fellowship to the Institute of Education, University of London.

===Law qualification===

After leaving Parliament, Gordon attended the University of Canterbury as an adult student, graduating with a law degree in 2007. She was admitted to the bar in November 2008. She then went on to study further in Māori language and culture and computer studies.

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===


Gordon was originally a member of the Labour Party, having joined in 1982. She served on its executive in 1988, but resigned from the party in April 1989 to become a founding member of the NewLabour Party. She was first elected to Parliament as a list MP for the Alliance, of which NewLabour was a component party, in the 1996 election, coming third in , and was re-elected in the 1999 election, again placing third in Christchurch Central. When the Alliance collapsed, Gordon sided with the faction led by Laila Harré and Matt McCarten, and remained with the Alliance when Jim Anderton left to form a breakaway party. In the 2002 election, she was ranked fourth on the party list, but the Alliance did not win any seats.

===Mayoral candidate===

In April 2010, Gordon announced that she would contest the mayoral contest for Christchurch City Council in the October 2010 election. Gordon stepped back from the mayoralty race in August 2010 and chose instead to run for one of the Riccarton-Wigram Ward seats on the council. After the election results were announced she was found not to have secured a Council seat, the winners being from the Christchurch 2021 group and Independent Citizens respectively. and was ranked several places below the qualifying number. She has since returned to her previous work as listed below.

==Life after Parliament==

Since leaving Parliament, Gordon run a small research and evaluation agency called Network Research Associates, which has since been renamed Pukeko Research. She spent four years on the Massey University Council, including a period as Pro-Chancellor, is an active member (and National President, since 2009) of the Quality Public Education Coalition, a Council member of the Howard League for Penal Reform (since 2005) and is active in local body affairs. She wrote a weekly opinion column for the Christchurch Press between 2006 and 2008. As of 2015 Gordon sits as a council member of the Royal Society of New Zealand, in this she has undertaken the role of constituent organisational representative.

<doc id="1082105" wikidata="Q455761" url="?curid=1082105" title="Mary Gilmore">
<text>Dame Mary Jean Gilmore (née Cameron; 16 August 18653 December 1962) was an Australian writer and journalist known for her prolific contributions to Australian literature and the broader national discourse. She wrote both prose and poetry.

Gilmore was born in rural New South Wales, and spent her childhood in and around the Riverina, living both in small bush settlements and in larger country towns like Wagga Wagga. Gilmore qualified as a schoolteacher at the age of 16, and after a period in the country was posted to Sydney. She involved herself with the burgeoning labour movement and the Bulletin School of radical nationalists, and she also became a devotee of the utopian socialist views of William Lane. In 1893, Gilmore and 200 others followed Lane to Paraguay, where they formed the New Australia Colony. She started a family there, but the colony did not live up to expectations and they returned to Australia in 1902.

Drawing on her connections in Sydney, Gilmore found work with &quot;The Australian Worker&quot; as the editor of its women&#x27;s section, a position she held from 1908 to 1931. She also wrote for a variety of other publications, including &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, becoming known as a campaigner for the welfare of the disadvantaged. Gilmore&#x27;s first volume of poetry was brought out in 1910; she published prolifically for the rest of her life, mainly poetry but also memoirs and collections of essays. She wrote on a variety of themes, although the public imagination was particularly captured by her evocative views of country life. Her best known work is &quot;No Foe Shall Gather Our Harvest&quot;, which served as a morale booster during World War II.

Gilmore&#x27;s greatest recognition came in later life. She was the doyenne of the Sydney literary world, and became something of a national icon, making frequent appearances in the new media of radio and television. Gilmore maintained her prodigious output into old age, publishing her last book of verse in 1954, aged 89. Two years earlier she had begun writing a new column for the &quot;Tribune&quot; (the official newspaper of the Communist Party), which she continued for almost a decade. Gilmore died at the age of 97 and was accorded a state funeral, a rare honour for a writer. She has featured on the reverse of the Australian ten-dollar note since 1993.

==Early life==

Mary Jean Cameron was born on 16 August 1865 at the small settlement of Cotta Walla (modern-day Roslyn), just outside Crookwell, New South Wales. When she was one year old her parents, Donald Cameron, a farmer from Scotland, and Mary Ann Beattie, decided to move to Wagga Wagga to join her maternal grandparents, the Beatties, who had moved there from Penrith, New South Wales in 1866.

Her father obtained a job as a station manager at a property at Cowabbie, 100 km north of Wagga. A year later, he left that job to become a carpenter, building homesteads on properties in Wagga, Coolamon, Junee, Temora and West Wyalong for the next 10 years. This itinerant existence allowed Mary only a spasmodic formal education; however, she did receive some on their frequent returns to Wagga, either staying with the Beatties or in rented houses.

Her father purchased land and built his own house at Brucedale on the Junee Road, where they had a permanent home. She was then to attend, albeit briefly, Colin Pentland&#x27;s private Academy at North Wagga Wagga and, when the school closed, transferred to Wagga Wagga Public School for two and a half years. At 14, in preparation to become a teacher, she worked as an assistant at her uncle&#x27;s school at Yerong Creek. Another uncle, Charles White (1845–1922), was a journalist and author of books on bushrangers, while an aunt, Jeannie Lockett (née Jane Beattie) was a teacher and writer.

After completing her teaching exams in 1882, she accepted a position as a teacher at Wagga Wagga Public School, where she worked until December 1885. After a short teaching spell at Illabo she took up a teaching position at Silverton near the mining town of Broken Hill. There Gilmore developed her socialist views and began writing poetry.

==Literary career==

In 1890, she moved to Sydney, where she became part of the Bulletin School, centered around the radical nationalist journal &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. Although the greatest influence on her work was Henry Lawson, it was Alfred &quot;A. G.&quot; Stephens, literary editor of &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, who published her verse and established her reputation as a fiery radical poet, champion of the workers and the oppressed.

She had a relationship with Henry Lawson that probably began in 1890. She writes of an unofficial engagement and Lawson&#x27;s wish to marry her, but it was broken by his frequent absences from Sydney. The story of the relationship is told in the play &quot;All My Love&quot;, written by Anne Brooksbank.

She followed William Lane and other socialist idealists to Paraguay in 1896, where they had established a communal settlement called New Australia two years earlier. At Lane&#x27;s breakaway settlement Cosme she married William Gilmore in 1897. By 1900 the socialist experiment had clearly failed. Will left to work as a shearer in Argentina and Mary and her two-year-old son Billy soon followed, living separately in Buenos Aires for about six months, and then the family moved to Patagonia until they saved enough for a return passage, via England, in 1902 to Australia, where they took up farming near Casterton, Victoria.

Gilmore&#x27;s first volume of poetry was published in 1910, and for the ensuing half-century she was regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s most popular and widely read poets. In 1908 she became women&#x27;s editor of &quot;The Worker&quot;, the newspaper of then Australia&#x27;s largest and most powerful trade union, the Australian Workers&#x27; Union (AWU). She was the union&#x27;s first woman member. &quot;The Worker&quot; gave her a platform for her journalism, in which she campaigned for the preservation of the White Australia Policy, better working conditions for working women, for children&#x27;s welfare and for a better deal for the Indigenous Australians. In 1925 the &quot;Society of Women Writers&quot; was formed and Florence Baverstock was the inaugural President. Her four vice-presidents who founded the society were Gilmore, Pattie Fotheringhame, Isobel Gullett and Mary Liddell and the aim was to encourage other women writers.

==Later life==

By 1931, Gilmore&#x27;s views had become too radical for the AWU, but she soon found other outlets for her writing. She later wrote a regular column for the Communist Party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Tribune&quot;, although she was never a party member herself. In spite of her somewhat controversial politics, Gilmore accepted appointment as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1937, becoming Dame Mary Gilmore. She was the first person to be granted the award for services to literature. During World War II, she wrote stirring patriotic verse such as &quot;No Foe Shall Gather Our Harvest&quot;.

In her later years, Gilmore, separated from her husband, moved to Sydney, and enjoyed her growing status as a national literary icon. Before 1940, she published six volumes of verse and three editions of prose. After the war, Gilmore published volumes of memoirs and reminiscences of colonial Australia and the literary giants of 1890s Sydney, thus contributing much material to the mythologising of that period. Dame Mary Gilmore died in 1962, aged 97, and was accorded the first state funeral for a writer since the death of Henry Lawson in 1922.

== Recognition and legacy==
Dobell&#x27;s 1957 portrait of Dame Mary Gilmore was a finalist in that year&#x27;s Archibald Prize, and can be seen in the Art Gallery of NSW.
In 1973 she was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post.

A park in West Pennant Hills, Sydney is named in her honour. The park hosts a large flag pole and Australian flag with the location historically being the location of a signal flag for communication between the early settlements of Parramatta and Windsor.

The Canberra suburb of Gilmore, the state highway Mary Gilmore Way (which runs east north east from Barmedman to Grenfell), a federal electorate, the Division of Gilmore and Gilmore Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Garran are named in her honour.

Gilmore&#x27;s image appears on the third series Australian $10 note (since 2017), along with an illustration inspired by &quot;No Foe Shall Gather Our Harvest&quot; and, as part of the copy-protection microprint, the text of the poem itself. The background of the illustration features a portrait of Gilmore by the well-known Australian artist Sir William Dobell.

She was the great-great aunt of politician and later prime minister Scott Morrison, who in 2012, on the 50th anniversary of her death, delivered a tribute to her in federal parliament.

In September 2019, Gilmore&#x27;s poem, &quot;No Foe Shall Gather Our Harvest&quot; was read aloud by United States president Donald Trump during a state dinner for Australia in the presence of prime minister Morrison.

===Mary Gilmore Award===
The Mary Gilmore Award was established in 1956 by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) as the ACTU Dame Mary Gilmore Award, and after several incarnations with prizes awarded in several different categories, has been awarded as a poetry prize since 1985, by the Association for the Study of Australian Literature.

<doc id="1082108" wikidata="Q7049016" url="?curid=1082108" title="Non-rigid designator">
<text>In the philosophy of language and modal logic, a term is said to be a non-rigid designator (or flaccid designator) or connotative term if it does not extensionally designate (denote, refer to) the same object in all possible worlds. This is in contrast to a rigid designator, which does designate the same object in all possible worlds in which that object exists, and does not designate anything else in those worlds in which that object does &quot;not&quot; exist. The term was coined by Saul Kripke in his 1970 lecture series at Princeton University, later published as the book &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;.

==Examples==
As an example, consider the phrase &quot;The 43rd President of the United States of America&quot;: while the 43rd President of the United States is &quot;actually&quot; George W. Bush, things might have been different. Bush might have lost the election, meaning that the 43rd President might have been Al Gore or Ralph Nader instead. (&quot;How remote&quot; these possible worlds are from the actual world is a discussion for physics and counterfactualism.) &quot;The 43rd President of the United States of America&quot; is thus a non-rigid designator, picking out George W. Bush in some possible worlds, Al Gore in others, and yet other people in other worlds.

Non-rigid designators are defined by contrast with Kripke&#x27;s notion of a rigid designator, which picks out the same thing uniquely in &quot;every&quot; possible world; while there are possible worlds in which the 43rd President of the United States is Al Gore instead of George W. Bush, there are &quot;no&quot; possible worlds where &quot;George W. Bush&quot; is anyone other than the man who, in fact, he is. (There &quot;are&quot; worlds where some person other than George W. Bush is &quot;named&quot; &quot;George W. Bush,&quot; but that&#x27;s neither here nor there.) Kripke uses this apparent asymmetry to argue (in &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;) that no definite description can be the meaning of a proper name, because names must always be rigid designators, while definite descriptions can designate non-rigidly.

==Criticism==
Some philosophers, such as Gareth Evans, have expressed doubt as to whether non-rigid expressions ought to be called &quot;designators&quot; at all.

<text>Honey Smacks (formerly known as Sugar Smacks, known simply as Smacks in some international markets) is a sweetened puffed wheat breakfast cereal made by Kellogg&#x27;s, noted for its high sugar content. It was introduced in the early 1950s.

==Naming==
Introduced in 1953, the cereal has undergone several name changes, starting out as &quot;Sugar Smacks&quot;. In the 1980s, it was renamed &quot;Honey Smacks&quot; in order to downplay its sugar content, even though the sugar content stayed the same. In the early 1990s, the word &quot;Honey&quot; was dropped from the name and the product was then simply called &quot;Smacks&quot;. That name is still used in Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. However, in the US the name reverted to &quot;Honey Smacks&quot; in 2004.

In the UK in 1957, a similar product called Sugar Puffs debuted. 

In Norway and Finland, it is known as &quot;Honni Korn Smacks&quot;.

In Australia, the cereal had been known as Honey Smacks since the 1970s. However, Kellogg&#x27;s Australia no longer markets the brand.

==Sugar content==

Presweetened breakfast cereals first appeared in 1939. At the time of its introduction in the early 1950s, Sugar Smacks had the highest sugar content in the US cereal market (56% per weight), surpassing Sugar Crisp (later renamed &quot;Golden Crisp&quot;) by competitor Post Cereal which had debuted with what &quot;The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets&quot; would later call &quot;an astonishing sugar content of 51 percent&quot;. (The cereals are both sweetened puffed wheat.)

In a 2008 comparison of the nutritional value of 27 cereals, US magazine &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; found that both Honey Smacks and the similar Golden Crisp were still the two brands with the highest sugar content, more than 50 percent (by weight), commenting &quot;There is at least as much sugar in a serving of Kellogg&#x27;s Honey Smacks [...] as there is in a glazed doughnut from Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&quot;. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; recommended parents choose cereal brands with better nutrition ratings for their children.

The product title &quot;Honey Smacks&quot; is incongruous, if not misrepresentative, since honey is actually a minor ingredient in the recipe. The ingredient label indicates that sugar and dextrose are at least two-thirds of the sugar ingredients by weight. Conversely, the proportion of honey in the recipe could range from trace amounts to one-third.

==2018 recall==
Kellogg&#x27;s announced a voluntary recall of certain Honey Smacks packages on June 14, 2018, due to the possible presence of salmonella. Although the recall included only packages with a specific range of expiration dates, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later advised consumers to avoid eating the cereal entirely. The cereal returned to the shelves in November of that year.

==Marketing history==

Since the cereal was introduced in 1953, there have been various different mascots.

===United States===
Cliffy the Clown

Various clowns served as the advertising mascot from 1953 to 1956, including Cliffy the Clown and Lou Jacobs from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. Ads with these clowns were known for showing them doing the &quot;Sugar Smack Swing&quot;.

Smaxey the Seal

In 1957, a sailor-suit-wearing seal named Smaxey became the mascot.

Quick Draw McGraw

The Hanna-Barbera cartoon horse sheriff, Quick Draw McGraw, took over in 1961.

The Smackin&#x27; Brothers

In 1966, the Smackin&#x27; Brothers, two cartoon boys who loved to roughhouse, became the new mascots. These ads usually featured the brothers wanting Sugar Smacks but winding up smacking each other instead. Also during 1966, promotional box designs were briefly introduced featuring characters from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Later commercials were similar to most Cheerios commercials as they demonstrated how the cereal was &quot;vitamin-powered&quot;. Paul Frees narrated these ads.

Dig&#x27;em Frog

In the early 1970s, an Indian Chief appeared briefly, replaced by Dig&#x27;em Frog in 1972. He continued as the mascot when the cereal was rechristened Honey Smacks in the early 1980s. In these ads, Dig&#x27;em would appear in front of a group of kids, and they would eat some cereal together.

Wally the Bear

Dig &#x27;em was replaced by an animal more associated with honey, Wally the Bear, in 1986 (1984 in France). These ads featured Wally (not to be confused with the Wally Bear from &quot;Wally Bear and the NO! Gang&quot;) pestering a kid eating a bowl of Honey Smacks and doing anything to get some, and the kid would always refuse or just ignore Wally completely. Animated by Kurtz &amp; Friends, these commercials performed poorly since they seemed too much like the Trix commercials, and Dig&#x27;em Frog was brought back the following year by popular demand.

Dig&#x27;em Frog (redux)

During the 1990s, advertising campaigns for the cereal featured Dig&#x27;em attempting to have a bowl of Smacks while trying to outsmart his nemesis, Kitty. By 1997, these commercials were discontinued. Dig&#x27;em&#x27;s voice was provided by Len Dresslar and later Frank Welker.

<doc id="1082123" wikidata="Q7185585" url="?curid=1082123" title="Phillida Bunkle">
<text>Phillida Bunkle (born 1944) is a former New Zealand politician. She represented the Alliance in Parliament from to 2002, when she retired. Bunkle was for many years a lecturer at Victoria University.

==Early life==
Bunkle was born in Sussex, England, and was educated at Keele University, England, receiving a BA with First Class Honours; Smith College, Massachusetts, USA, receiving a MA; and St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford. She attended Harvard University, USA as a Kennedy Scholar and was the recipient of a Fulbright Award.

==Life before politics==
Bunkle lectured in history at Victoria University of Wellington. In 1975, she founded the Women&#x27;s Studies programme (later department), the first of its kind at a New Zealand university. She taught at the university until her election to Parliament in 1996.

She was married for many years to Jock Phillips, a university colleague and noted historian. The couple divorced in 1993, before Bunkle was elected to Parliament.

Her position at the forefront of the women’s health movement was established when Bunkle researched and published, with Sandra Coney, &quot;An Unfortunate Experiment at National Women&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, a piece which documented that women with cervical cancer had unwittingly been used as experimental research subjects at New Zealand&#x27;s leading women&#x27;s hospital. The original article has been reprinted numerous times. For their work Coney and Bunkle were awarded the National Humanist&#x27;s Society Supreme Human Rights Award, the Supreme Media Women’s Award and the Governor General&#x27;s Special Award for Excellence in Journalism.

==Political career==

Bunkle joined the Green Party (then a participatory member of the Alliance) in 1992, and unsuccessfully stood as an Alliance candidate in the 1993 election in Onslow, placing third. In 1995 she ran as the Alliance candidate for mayor of Wellington, placing a distant sixth. In the 1996 election, she was elected to Parliament as a list MP, sitting as a member of the Alliance. When the Green Party left the Alliance, Bunkle opted not to follow them. After the 1999 election, in which Bunkle was re-elected, she became a Minister outside of Cabinet in the new Labour-Alliance coalition government, serving as Minister of Customs and Minister of Consumer Affairs.

Bunkle took a strong anti-gambling stance, being patron of Compulsive Gambling Society Incorporated and introducing a Bill to restrict gambling.

She resigned these roles after a controversy surrounding her claims for a residential allowance, although she was later cleared of any deliberate wrongdoing. When the Alliance began to collapse in 2002, Bunkle sided with Jim Anderton&#x27;s faction, but decided not to seek re-election.

In 2020, Bunkle wrote an essay for Newsroom about her time in politics, in which she alleged that bullying, factional power-play and misuse of funding had been commonplace in the Alliance, and that this was an example of an abusive culture throughout Parliament that persists to the present.

==Life after Parliament==
After leaving parliament at the 2002 general election, Bunkle worked overseas, including in China as a women&#x27;s studies teacher and in Britain where she completed an MSc in integrated health.

In 2003 Bunkle was appointed as a member of the Alcohol Advisory Council of New Zealand. She served two months before resigning her membership, citing her relocation to the United Kingdom as her reason for her resignation.

In 2007 she was charged with theft after allegedly shoplifting a bottle of wine and two packets of coffee from a supermarket in Paraparaumu. She pleaded guilty and was given diversion.

<text>Daysend (pronounced &quot;days-end&quot;) are an Australian melodic death metal band, originally formed in Sydney, New South Wales in 2002 by Aaron Bilbija and Meredith Webster. They were joined later that year by Wayne Morris on drums. From 2003 to 2006 their lead vocalist was Simon Calabrese, who was replaced by Mark McKernan. The group released three albums, &quot;Severance&quot; (November 2003), &quot;The Warning&quot; (May 2007) and &quot;Within the Eye of Chaos&quot; (February 2010), before disbanding in May 2011.

==History==

Daysend were formed in mid-2002 by Aaron Bilbija on guitars, Matt Lamb on drums and Meredith Webster on bass guitar. All three had been members of a thrash metal band, Psi.Kore, which were founded by Lamb&#x27;s brother Chuck, guitarist Adam Boyle and bassist Lex Dourian in 1996; Lamb had joined in 1997 and Webster took Dourian&#x27;s place in late 1998. The band recorded an EP with Chatterbox Records in 2000 and toured Australia widely before Bilbija was recruited in early 2002. Relations within the group pushed Chuck Lamb out and the remaining members decided to continue in a slightly different musical direction. In 1995, Bilbija had formed a death metal band called Deadspawn and with the eventual line-up of himself plus Dave Micallef (vocals, guitar), Bob Latsombath (bass) and Wayne Morris (drums), that group had released an album on Warhead Records in 1999 before eventually splitting up when Micallef left in mid-2001. Bilbija now recruited Micallef into his latest band, and Daysend was formed with guitarist Michael Kordek (from a death metal act called Automation and then, briefly, Infernal Method with Bilbija) also coming into the group. The line-up was only together briefly before Matt Lamb left, his place taken by Morris. Lamb has since played in a variety of Sydney rock and metal bands.

A debut live show with Melbourne death metal band Earth was booked but Micallef quit Daysend before the show; the band played regardless as an instrumental act. Inheriting Psi.Kore&#x27;s manager, Chatterbox owner Nik Tropiano, who had helped push that group to the verge of major success, Daysend was listed on the bill for the 2002 Metal for the Brain festival and slated to open for Austrian death metal band Pungent Stench shortly afterward, both without so much as having either a recording or a vocalist. However, Metal for the Brain was cancelled due to an insurance cost blow-out and Daysend had still not found a singer in time for the Pungent Stench tour. In January 2003, Simon Calabrese was recruited as lead vocalist. Calabrese had previously been with a nu metal act called Redsands that had recorded an EP before disbanding.

===&quot;Severance&quot;===

With Calabrese in place, Daysend immediately found themselves supporting Sweden&#x27;s The Haunted in March and then on a national tour with the reformed Melbourne grindcore band Damaged. After that, Daysend spent ten days recording the debut album &quot;Severance&quot;, which was released by Chatterbox in October. &quot;Severance&quot; was voted Best Australian Metal Album in a Triple J listeners poll soon after, an honour it shared with &quot;Renascent Misanthropy&quot; by Brisbane black metal band Astriaal.

2004 saw Daysend touring heavily. They supported Slipknot, In Flames, Shadows Fall and Machine Head and toured nationally with Entombed. &quot;Severance&quot; was released in the United States by Metal Blade Records and by Locomotive in Europe in November. When the Metal for the Brain festival added two extra shows in Brisbane and Perth along with its regular Canberra fixture in February 2005, Daysend appeared at each. Two days before this, however, Kordek suddenly left the band. His replacement was Andrew Lilley, who had most recently served a brief spell with Melbourne thrash band Atomizer. Lilley&#x27;s addition to Daysend caused some initial surprise as he had been fired from Psi.Kore in mid-2001, then coincidentally joined Infernal Method after Bilbija had left to join Psi.Kore. However, after learning the band&#x27;s entire set in one emergency rehearsal, he slotted into the Daysend line-up.

In May 2005, Daysend toured the US for six weeks with Otep. On returning to Australia, the band split with both its management and with Lilley. Michael Kordek rejoined and some work began on a second album. Further activity was stalled however when Simon Calabrese left Daysend in May 2006. Within a short time, however, ex-Headcage vocalist Mark Halcroft (McKernan) joined the band. 

===&quot;The Warning&quot;===

After playing just two shows with Halcroft, Daysend began recording &quot;The Warning&quot; in November 2006 with DW Norton, who had also produced the debut. Norton signed the band to his label Faultline and the album was released on 28 May 2007 ahead of Daysend&#x27;s appearance at Sydney&#x27;s two-day Come Together Festival. A national tour began soon after but at least one show was cancelled when Morris received an eye injury from a broken drumstick during a show in Sydney on 13 July.

In late November 2007, Michael Kordek left the band to follow &quot;other musical and non-musical interests&quot;. He was replaced by Jason Turnbull in late 2007, playing his first show with the band on New Year&#x27;s Eve. In July 2008 Daysend then travelled to New Zealand for a small tour with Subtract. August saw Daysend play a string of shows with Perth band Dyscord, and be the direct support for Trivium&#x27;s one off Australian show at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. In October, Daysend supported renowned UK metal band Carcass at Sydney&#x27;s Metro Theatre, before playing a string of New South Wales shows with Dyscord, Psycroptic and the US deathcore band Whitechapel in early January 2009. 

===&quot;Within The Eye of Chaos&quot; and split===

In mid 2009, Daysend began recording their third album as a four-piece since Turnbull had left the group. &quot;Within the Eye of Chaos&quot; was released on 19 February 2010, on the Stomp label. A national tour followed with Braithe Selby as a touring member. On 10 July 2010, the band played Utopia Records 30th Anniversary show which marked the return of Jason Turnbull to the line-up.

Daysend played only a handful of shows throughout the year. In 2011 it was announced that Daysend would be touring Australia with Nevermore in June; however, that tour was cancelled. On 5 May, Daysend announced through their Facebook page that they were disbanding: &quot;The reason is not due to artistic differences or personal issues but rather that we feel we cannot continue with the band any longer. We would like to extend our sincerest thanks to our family and friends who have supported us over the years and most of all, our loyal fans&quot;. The announcement was carried by various Australian metal websites.

In June 2019, Daysend&#x27;s full discography was added to major music streaming services.

In mid-2024, ex-Daysend guitarists Aaron Bilbija and Jason Turnbull helped reform Sydney death/thrash/groove metal band Mortality on guitars. Similarly in 2024, ex-Daysend guitarist Michael Kordek rejoined his previous band Automation, and ex-Daysend vocalist Simon Calabrese reformed his previous band Redsands. 

In February 2025, the band announced their reunion.

<doc id="1082139" wikidata="Q6252301" url="?curid=1082139" title="John Paulding">
<text>John Paulding (October 16, 1758 – February 18, 1818) was an American militiaman from the state of New York during the American Revolution. In 1780, he was one of three men who captured Major John André, a British spy associated with the treason of Continental general and commandant of West Point Benedict Arnold. Andre was convicted and hanged.

==American Revolution==

In 1780, while visiting his future wife, Sarah Tidd, Paulding was detained by a group of Loyalists led by his future brother-in-law. He was imprisoned in the sugar house prisons in New York City, but escaped by jumping from a window. Paulding went to the livery stable of a friend and acquired a coat of a Hessian soldier, which he wore to evade notice.

As part of an armed patrol in Westchester County, with fellow militiamen David Williams and Isaac Van Wart, Paulding detained British Major John André, who had left Benedict Arnold after discussing the latter&#x27;s defection to the British. This site is now commemorated as Patriot&#x27;s Park on the border of Tarrytown, New York and Sleepy Hollow, New York. André, seeing Paulding&#x27;s Hessian coat, may have assumed him to be a soldiers of De Lancey&#x27;s Brigade, a Loyalist military unit which had been raiding the Neutral Ground for cattle and supplies. Searching André for valuables, they discovered documents of his secret communication with Benedict Arnold. The militiamen, all local yeomen farmers, refused André&#x27;s attempt to bribe them, and delivered the officer to the Continental Army. Arnold&#x27;s plans to surrender West Point to the British were revealed and foiled, and André was convicted and hanged as a spy.

With George Washington&#x27;s personal recommendation, the United States Congress awarded Paulding, Williams, and Van Wart the first military decoration of the United States, the silver medal known as the Fidelity Medallion. Each of the three also received federal pensions of $200 a year. New York State granted them each lands for farms.

The celebrated trio were commemorated far and wide as popular heroes after the patriots won the war. By an act of Congress, the new state of Ohio (1803) included the counties named Paulding, Van Wert (anglicized spelling), and Williams. Paulding was held in particularly high regard by early American historians, as the standard 19th-century accounts credited him with the decision-making and initiative at the scene.

Though hailed as national heroes, Paulding and the others also received criticism. The divisions in society continued after the war. At his trial André insisted the men were mere brigands; sympathy for Andre remained among some more elite American quarters, which included some Loyalists. (André&#x27;s reputation was high in England, where his body was returned and he was buried in Westminster Abbey). Representative Benjamin Tallmadge of Connecticut, who had been present as an American officer in Westchester County in 1780 and had a low opinion of the three common militiamen, had accepted André&#x27;s account of his capture and search. Tallmadge argued in Congress for the rejection of a requested pension increase in 1817 for Paulding. He assailed the credibility and motivations of the three captors.

Despite this slight, the men&#x27;s popular acclaim generally increased throughout the 19th century, although opinion on their motives and actions remained divided. Some modern scholars have interpreted the episode as a major event in early American cultural development, representing the apotheosis of the &quot;common man&quot; in the new democratic society.

==Personal life==
Paulding was born on October 16, 1758, at the Paulding homestead near Tarrytown in Peekskill in the Province of New York in what was then British America. He was the son of Joseph Paulding.

Paulding was a self-sufficient yeoman farmer and was described as a strong, sturdy man, standing more than six feet tall, unusual for the era. Paulding married three times in his life, and lost two wives to death. In total he had nineteen children by them. On April 21, 1781, he was married to Sarah Tidd (1767–1789) of Salem, New York.

After Sarah&#x27;s death on October 23, 1789, he remarried to Esther Ward (1768–1804) on November 18, 1790. Esther was the daughter of Caleb Ward and Mary (née Drake) Ward. Together, they were the parents of:
* Hiram Paulding (1797–1878), a Rear Admiral in the United States Navy, who served from the War of 1812 until after the Civil War

Esther died in 1804 and in 1806, he married for the third time to Hester Denike (d. 1855), the daughter of Isaac Denike of Peekskill.

He died in 1818 at Staatsburg, Dutchess County, New York of natural causes. His last words were reported to be: &quot;I die a true republican.&quot; He was buried in the cemetery of Old Saint Peter&#x27;s Church in Van Cortlandtville, Cortlandt Manor.

===Descendants===
Paulding&#x27;s descendants are numerous but perhaps the best-known of them is his son Hiram Paulding (b.1797 - d.1878), who served in the War of 1812 and fought in the Battle of Lake Champlain; he rose to become a Rear Admiral in the United States Navy and retired only after the end of the American Civil War.

===Relations===
Among his extended family were cousins James Kirke Paulding, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy under President Martin Van Buren; William Paulding Jr., who served as mayor of New York City, a U.S. Representative and the Adjutant General of New York; and Julia Paulding, who married U.S. Representative William Irving (brother of author and diplomat Washington Irving).

==Legacy==

Paulding&#x27;s grave is marked by a large marble monument with the epitaph:

FIDELITY - On the morning of the 23rd of September 1780, accompanied by two young farmers of the county of West Chester, he intercepted the British spy, André. Poor himself, he disdained to acquire wealth by the sacrifice of his country. Rejecting the temptation of great rewards, he conveyed his prisoner to the American camp and, by this noble act of self-denial, the treason of Arnold was detected; the designs of the enemy baffled; West Point and the American Army saved; and these United States, now by the grace of God Free and Independent, rescued from most imminent peril.

In 1853, a monument was erected at the site of André&#x27;s capture in Tarrytown. On the event&#x27;s centenary in 1880, it was topped with the statue of a minuteman. Carved by the sculptor William Rudolf O&#x27;Donovan (1844–1920), the statue is reputedly in the likeness of Paulding himself. It is located in Patriot&#x27;s Park, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. A street called Paulding Drive in Chappaqua, New York was named in his honor.

According to Marcius D. Raymond, several villages and counties are named in his honor: Paulding County, Ohio; Paulding County, Georgia; Paulding, Michigan (site of the mysterious Paulding Light); Paulding, New Jersey; and Paulding, Mississippi. Additionally, the villages of Tarrytown (where there is a John Paulding Elementary School), Cold Spring and Elmsford, along with the cities of Peekskill and White Plains, all in New York, each have a street named for Paulding (as well as ones for Williams and Van Wart). The Fire Department of Sparkill, New York, maintains the John Paulding Engine Co., founded in 1901.

<doc id="1082158" wikidata="Q2442137" url="?curid=1082158" title="Goldfinger (album)">
<text>Goldfinger is the debut studio album by punk rock band Goldfinger, released on Mojo Records in February 1996 and produced by Mojo founder Jay Rifkin. The album was a hit on college radio. The single &quot;Here in Your Bedroom&quot; was a top 5 rock hit in the U.S. in the summer of 1996, and also reached No. 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart, making it their highest charting single ever. The album was certified gold in Canada (50,000 copies) in 2002. It is the only album by the band not to be produced by frontman John Feldmann in any capacity.

Horns on the album were provided by members of other Southern California ska and ska punk bands, including trombonist Dan Regan and trumpeter Scott Klopfenstein of Reel Big Fish and saxophonist Efren Santana of Hepcat. Paul Hampton of the Skeletones provided keyboards on the album and is featured in the video for &quot;Here in Your Bedroom&quot;. The cover for the album was drawn by Alan Forbes. It depicts a &quot;big sex god alien chasing this little man, &#x27;50s style&quot;.

Although &quot;Goldfinger&quot; is a well-known album among the ska punk community, Feldmann does not consider it a work of that genre.

== Music and song information ==
&quot;Goldfinger&quot; was recorded in Hans Zimmer studio by the time he was recording &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;. For the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Feldmann commented on its music:

The opening track &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; was the first song Feldmann wrote for Goldfinger. Commenting on the feedback heard in the very first seconds of the song, he said: &quot;We recorded that album on tape. It was all super experimental—&#x27;Well what if we have the feedback going, we hit record and start playing so the tape starts with nothing.&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Anything&quot; was written by a 17-year-old Feldmann.

==Track listing==
All songs written by John Feldmann, except where noted. 
==Personnel==
*John Feldmann – vocals, guitar
*Charlie Paulson – guitar, vocals

<doc id="1082162" wikidata="Q385941" url="?curid=1082162" title="William Zorach">
<text>William Zorach (February 28, 1889 – November 15, 1966) was an American sculptor, painter, printmaker, and writer. He won the Logan Medal of the Arts in 1927. He was at the forefront of American artists embracing cubism.

He is the husband of Marguerite Thompson Zorach and father of Dahlov Ipcar, both artists in their own right.

==Early life==
Zorach Gorfinkel was born in 1889 into a Lithuanian Jewish family, the son of a barge owner, in Jurbarkas () in Lithuania (then a part of the Russian Empire). As the eighth of ten children, Zorach (then his given name) emigrated with his family to the United States in 1894. They settled in Cleveland, Ohio under the name &quot;Finkelstein&quot;. In school, his first name was changed to &quot;William&quot; by a teacher. Zorach stayed in Ohio for almost 15 years pursuing his artistic endeavors. He apprenticed with a lithographer as a teenager and went on to study painting with Henry G. Keller in night school at the Cleveland School of Art from 1905 to 1907. In 1908, Zorach moved to New York in enroll in the National Academy of Design. In 1910, Zorach moved to Paris with Cleveland artist and lithographer, Elmer Brubeck, to continue his artistic training at the La Palette art school.

==Career==
While in Paris, Zorach met Marguerite Thompson (1887–1968), an art student and fellow American, whom he married on December 24, 1912, in New York City. The couple adopted his original given name, Zorach, as a common surname. Zorach and his wife returned to America where they continued to experiment with different media. In 1913, works by both Zorach and Marguerite, were included in the now famous Armory Show, introducing his work to the general public as well as art critics and collectors. Both William and Marguerite were heavily influenced by cubism and fauvism. They are credited as being among the premier artists to introduce European styles to American modernism. During the next seven years, Zorach established himself as a painter, frequently displaying his paintings in gallery shows as venues such as the Society of Independent Artists and the Whitney Studio Club. While Marguerite began to experiment with textiles and created large, fine art tapestries and hooked rugs, William began to experiment with sculpture, which would become his primary medium.
In 1915, William and Marguerite started their family with the birth of their son, Tessim. Their daughter, Dahlov Ipcar, was born in 1917, and would later also work as an artist. While the Zorach family spent their winters in New York, their summers were divided between New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Notably, they spent a few summers in Plainfield, New Hampshire at the Cornish Art Colony, renting Echo Farm which was owned by their friend and fellow artist Henry Fitch Taylor. It was here that their daughter was born, all the while producing various prints depicting country life. He was also a member of the Provincetown Printers art colony in Massachusetts.

In 1923, the Zorach family purchased a farm on Georgetown Island, Maine where they resided, worked, and entertained guests. Zorach was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1953.

==Works==
Zorach&#x27;s works can be found in numerous private, corporate, and public collections across the country including such acclaimed locales as the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, Radio City Music Hall, the Currier Museum of Art, Joslyn Art Museum, and the Ogunquit Museum of American Art, as well as numerous college and university collections. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

<text>Jonathan Brown (born 29 October 1981) is a former Australian rules footballer and radio presenter. He is the former captain of the Brisbane Lions in the Australian Football League. 

Regarded during his playing days as one of the premier players in the competition, Brown is a three-time club Best and Fairest winner, two-time All Australian (2007 and 2009), one-time Coleman Medallist and three-time AFL premiership player.

==Early life==

Brown was born in Port Fairy, in Victoria&#x27;s south west, to mother Mary and father Brian (a former Fitzroy and Essendon player). He is the eldest of three brothers.

Brown grew up on his family&#x27;s property and attended school at Emmanuel College Warrnambool. He grew up a Fitzroy fan and began playing Australian rules at an early age, playing school football and cricket with the Emmanuel College Hawks. Brown began playing senior football with the South Warrnambool Football Club at the age of 15. He began senior cricket at about the same time and was a stand-out left-arm fast bowler. He played A-Grade cricket with Wesley CBC where he was Cricketer of the Year two years in a row and played in a senior premiership. He was also invited to play in the Victorian under-17 squad. However, he focused on Australian rules, pursuing a dream of following Ted Whitten to represent Victoria in State of Origin. Brown drew the attention of AFL recruiters while playing under-18 representative football for the Geelong Falcons in 1999 at the national carnival in Brisbane when he was named as an All-Australian.

==AFL career==
===Drafting and first year: 1999–2000===
Brown was selected by the Brisbane Lions in the 1999 AFL Draft under the father–son rule. His father considered Brisbane a good option when Leigh Matthews became the senior coach, despite Hawthorn showing interest in recruiting him. Upon moving to Brisbane, he was immediately groomed as the club&#x27;s next centre half-forward. The next year, in Round 5, he played his first senior game for the Lions as an 18-year-old against the Adelaide Crows. His best game in his opening year came against Fremantle in the final round of the season when he had 23 disposals and scored two goals.

===Four consecutive Grand Finals: 2001–2004===
Playing in a team which included three Brownlow Medalists (Michael Voss, Jason Akermanis and Simon Black), Brown participated in four consecutive AFL Grand Finals and was a part of three consecutive premierships in 2001, 2002 and 2003.

Touted as the next Wayne Carey early in his career, Brown was an unspectacular but consistent contributor during his first few seasons and, at 195 cm and 105 kg, was an imposing target across half-forward. In Round 6 of 2001, Brown kicked seven goals and amassed nine marks and 19 disposals in his first dominant performance in front of goals. For the season, he averaged six marks, 14 disposals and 1.5 goals per game. His season tally of 157 marks was a team-high, and his total of 38 goals was third-best of Brisbane players.

Brown was well renowned for his bravery, often putting himself in reckless situations that put the mission of the team before his own physical well-being. An example of this was when he took the 2002 Mark of the Year by running with the flight of the ball and launching into the oncoming Hawthorn player Jade Rawlings. In an interview with Mike Sheehan for &quot;Open Mike&quot;, Brown acknowledged he was running towards the pack blindly (i.e. with his eyes only on the ball, not the players converging on the pack) and committed fully to the attempt. Such efforts earned him numerous titles for courage during his career, including three Robert Rose Awards for being voted the most courageous player of the league in 2007, 2008 and 2011. Such acts of courage caused recurring injuries, especially during the past few years of his career, including four facial injuries between 2011 and 2014.

Plagued by injury and regular meetings with the AFL Tribunal during the next three seasons, Brown&#x27;s development was hampered until 2004, when he had the best season of his career to that point, averaging an impressive eight marks, 16 disposals, and 2.3 goals per game. Despite missing eight games through injury and suspension, Brown kicked a career-high 39 goals and again led the Lions in marks, with 140. His progress was punctuated in the Qualifying Final against St Kilda when he achieved a best-afield six-goal performance. The season, however, ended on a sour note for Brown, as he was reported for striking Port Adelaide&#x27;s Josh Carr during the Lions 40-point Grand Final loss. The report saw Brown suspended for the first five games of the 2005 season.

===Reaching peak form: 2005–2006===
In 2005, Brown was promoted to the Lions&#x27; leadership group. He made his return from suspension in Round 6 of 2005 against Essendon and immediately had a significant impact, taking 14 marks and kicking eight goals on then-Essendon defender and future Sydney Swans premiership player Ted Richards, in what was arguably the best game of his career to that point. Richards was dropped from the Essendon team as a result. The following week, Brown kicked another five goals, and in Round 10 against the Kangaroos Brown had 12 marks, 27 disposals and five goals, followed by a career-high 29 disposals in round 11. Injury again cut his season short, but 2005 was clearly Brown&#x27;s best individual season as he averaged eight marks, 18 disposals and 2.8 goals per game during the 12 games he played prior to Round 17, before a severe bout of osteitis pubis prevented him from having any influence in his last two games.

In May 2005, Brown was targeted by Collingwood in a deal reportedly worth $6 million over the next four seasons, but he was quick to announce that he had no plans to leave Brisbane. Two months later he officially signed a contract committing himself to the Brisbane Lions until the end of the 2008 season in a deal reportedly worth $2 million over three years.

2006 was the year in which Brown first stamped his authority on the AFL competition. Midway through the season, Brown seemed certain to claim almost every individual award on offer at the end of the year, as he dominated in the air and in front of goals on a weekly basis. Brown&#x27;s form hit a peak between rounds 7 and 10, when over four games he averaged 11 marks, 20 disposals and 6.5 goals per game, including performances of seven or more goals in three successive games. Injury, however, ended his season prematurely yet again, as Brown played his last game of the season in Round 10. In the 2006 Brownlow Medal count, Brown polled 13 votes, enough to secure a top 10 finish despite only playing 10 games out of a possible 22. He was leading the count easily before he suffered the injury.

===Vintage form: 2007–2009===

Following the retirement of long-time captain Michael Voss in 2006, Brown was strongly favoured to replace Voss as captain. Nevertheless, when the captaincy was announced on 20 March 2007, Brown was named as co-captain alongside Simon Black, Chris Johnson, Nigel Lappin, and Luke Power. Brown had previously acted as co-captain for the Lions in the 2007 NAB Cup Grand Final, alongside Black, Johnson, and Power, with Lappin out injured. Desperate for an injury-free season, 2007 delivered just that for Brown, and what resulted was the best season of his career. He averaged nine marks and 16 disposals per game, and kicked 77 goals at 3.5 per game in 2007. In round 16 against Carlton, he became the first Brisbane player to kick 10 goals in a game, and he finished the year with seven goals against Geelong to secure the Coleman Medal as the season&#x27;s leading goal kicker. That year Brown took the most contested marks in the competition to go with his first Coleman. He also won his first Merrett–Murray Medal (the Lions best and fairest), the AFL Players Association Best Captain Award, the Robert Rose Award for Most Courageous Player, was runner-up in the Leigh Matthews Trophy as League MVP and was named vice-captain of the All Australian team. At season&#x27;s end, Brown was regarded by many, including AFL guru Mike Sheahan, as the number-one player in the competition.

Brown started the 2008 season slowly compared to his 2007 form, and was rested for one game in round seven due to minor injury concerns. He then returned to his best with three consecutive six-goal performances and combined with Daniel Bradshaw to be one of the most formidable forward duos in the league in the second half of the season. In the 15 games after his week off, Brown averaged nine marks, 16 disposals and 3.7 goals per game, although his season stats were inferior to the previous year. Brown captained Victoria in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match against the Dream Team, and a spectacular mark taken over Matthew Richardson in that game is captured in Jamie Cooper&#x27;s painting &quot;The Game That Made Australia&quot;, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport. He was named the AFLPA Most courageous player at the end of the 2008 season by his peers for the second consecutive year in a row, but missed out on a second All-Australian selection. Brown&#x27;s 2008 season was capped off by winning his second Merrett–Murray Medal.

At the completion of Round 22 of the 2008 season, Brown announced he had signed a four-year contract that would see him remain a Lion until he is at least 31. On 27 October 2008, Lions coach Michael Voss announced Brown&#x27;s appointment as sole captain of the club.

2009 was Brown&#x27;s most consistent year to date, being kept goalless just once and kicking two or more goals in a club record 17 consecutive games. In round 6, Brown had 13 marks, 24 disposals and five goals against Essendon, and in Round 17, he kicked eight goals against North Melbourne, including his 400th career goal. He also had 21 disposals and 12 marks. He placed second in the Coleman Medal at season&#x27;s end, eight goals behind winner Brendan Fevola, and took the most contested marks in the league. He finished the year with a career-high, and Brisbane Lions record, 85 goals and averaged 8.5 marks and 16 disposals per game. His 19 Brownlow Medal votes placed him fourth overall and he concluded the year with his third consecutive best and fairest medal, second All-Australian selection and the AFLPA Best Captain Award.

===Battling injuries and retirement: 2010–2014===

Brown was hampered by injury throughout the 2010 season, causing him to miss six games for the Lions. After a promising start to 2010, Brown and other key Brisbane players were struck by injury, and the team finished the season in 13th position on the ladder. Despite missing six games and the controversial introduction of Coleman Medallist Brendan Fevola to the team, Brown was again the Lions leading goalkicker, with 53 for the season, and he came third in Brisbane&#x27;s best and fairest, behind Michael Rischitelli and Simon Black. Brown was named the Members&#x27; Player of the Year and polled almost half of his best-and-fairest votes in the first four rounds.

Brown suffered a horrific facial injury in the first game of the 2011 season against Fremantle after he was kneed in the head by opposition defender Luke McPharlin in a marking attempt.

Brown suffered a second facial injury in round 17 of the 2011 season.

Brown suffered a third facial injury in less than three years in a 2012 intraclub match when teammate Matt Maguire kneed him in the head in a marking contest. Doubts started to surface over his career after such consistent damages to his skull.

In 2013, Jed Adcock was named as the Lions&#x27; co-captain alongside Brown, and, in 2014, Adcock was named as the sole captain, meaning that the Lions were not captained or co-captained by Brown for the first time since 2007.

Brown was the victim of a fourth facial injury in the Round 13, 2014 clash between the Lions and the Greater Western Sydney Giants. He collided with Tomas Bugg&#x27;s knee and was removed from the ground. He suffered a concussion, causing his retirement from football.

==Media career==

In 2009, Brown appeared alongside other AFL footballers in an AFL television advertisement titled &quot;AFL: In a League of its Own&quot;, which featured prominent AFL players playing Australian rules football at famous sporting venues around the world, and in the middle of other sports being played, including basketball, Association football and American football. In the advertisement, Brown is running with the ball on an American football field evading and fending off defenders before running into Chad Cornes. The contact between the players results in the scene changing to a boxing ring, where after evading a boxer, he attempts to kick the ball, with Cornes smothering his kick.

Brown was a regular guest panellist on &quot;The AFL Footy Show&quot; throughout his playing career and was regularly heard on &quot;Ash, Kip and Luttsy&quot; on Nova 106.9.

In 2009, Brown featured in an official advertisement for the AFL, playing Australian rules with opponent Chad Cornes in a boxing ring and breaking the tackles of American football players.

In February 2015, Brown joined Fox Footy&#x27;s commentary team and began featuring on &quot;On the Couch&quot;.

In November 2015, Brown was announced as a co-host of Nova 100&#x27;s new breakfast show &quot;Chrissie, Sam &amp; Browny&quot;, alongside Chrissie Swan and Sam Pang.

==Personal life==

Brown&#x27;s father, Brian Brown, played football with Fitzroy and Jonathan was recruited to the Lions under the father–son rule. He is also the nephew of former Fitzroy player Noel Mugavin and former Collingwood player Billy Picken, and cousin of Western Bulldogs player Liam Picken.

On 25 October 2008 Brown married Kylie Adams. They have three children, two girls and a boy. 
He resides in the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell.

<text>Stratigraphy is a key concept to modern archaeological theory and practice. Modern excavation techniques are based on stratigraphic principles. The concept derives from the geological use of the idea that sedimentation takes place according to uniform principles.
When archaeological finds are below the surface of the ground (as is most commonly the case), the identification of the context of each find is vital in enabling the archaeologist to draw conclusions about the site and about the nature and date of its occupation. It is the archaeologist&#x27;s role to attempt to discover what contexts exist and how they came to be created. Archaeological stratification or sequence is the dynamic superimposition of single units of stratigraphy, or contexts.

Contexts are single events or actions that leave discrete, detectable traces in the archaeological sequence or stratigraphy. They can be deposits (such as the back-fill of a ditch), structures (such as walls), or &quot;zero thickness surfaces&quot;, better known as &quot;cuts&quot;. Cuts represent actions that remove other solid contexts such as fills, deposits, and walls. An example would be a ditch &quot;cut&quot; through earlier deposits. Stratigraphic relationships are the relationships created between contexts in time, representing the chronological order in which they were created. One example would be a ditch and the back-fill of said ditch. The temporal relationship of &quot;the fill&quot; context to the ditch &quot;cut&quot; context is such that &quot;the fill&quot; occurred later in the sequence; you have to dig a ditch before you can back-fill it. A relationship that is later in the sequence is sometimes referred to as &quot;higher&quot; in the sequence, and a relationship that is earlier, &quot;lower&quot;, though this does not refer necessarily to the physical location of the context. It is more useful to think of &quot;higher&quot; as it relates to the context&#x27;s position in a Harris matrix, a two-dimensional representation of a site&#x27;s formation in space and time.

==Principles or laws==
Archaeological stratigraphy is based on a series of axiomatic principles or &quot;laws&quot;. They are derived from the principles of stratigraphy in geology but have been adapted to reflect the different nature of archaeological deposits. E.C. Harris notes two principles that were widely recognised by archaeologists by the 1970s:

* The principle of superposition establishes that within a series of layers and interfacial features, as originally created, the upper units of stratification are younger and the lower are older, for each must have been deposited on, or created by the removal of, a pre-existing mass of archaeological stratification.
* The principle that layers can be no older than the age of the most recent artefact discovered within them. This is the basis for the relative dating of layers using artefact typologies. It is analogous to the geological principle of faunal succession, although Harris argued that it was not strictly applicable to archaeology.

He also proposed three additional principles:
* The principle of original horizontality states that any archaeological layer deposited in an unconsolidated form will tend towards a horizontal deposition. Strata which are found with tilted surfaces were so originally deposited, or lie in conformity with the contours of a pre-existing basin of deposition.
* The principle of lateral continuity states that any archaeological deposit, as originally laid down, will be bounded by the edge of the basin of deposition, or will thin down to a feather edge. Therefore, if any edge of the deposit is exposed in a vertical plane view, a part of its original extent must have been removed by excavation or erosion: its continuity must be sought, or its absence explained.
* The principle of stratigraphic succession states that any given unit of archaeological stratification exists within the stratigraphic sequence from its position between the undermost of all higher units and the uppermost of all lower units and with which it has a physical contact.

==Combining stratigraphic contexts for interpretation==

Understanding a site in modern archaeology is a process of grouping single contexts together in ever larger groups by virtue of their relationships. The terminology of these larger clusters varies depending on the practitioner, but the terms interface, sub-group, and group are common. An example of a sub-group could be the three contexts that make up a burial; the grave cut, the body, and the back-filled earth on top of the body. Sub-groups can then be clustered together with other sub-groups by virtue of their stratigraphic relationship to form groups, which in turn form &quot;phases.&quot; A sub-group burial could cluster with other sub-group burials to form a cemetery, which in turn could be grouped with a building, such as a church, to produce a &quot;phase&quot;. Phase implies a nearly contemporaneous Archaeological horizon, representing &quot;what you would see if you went back to time X&quot;. The production of phase interpretations is the first goal of stratigraphic interpretation and excavation.

==Stratigraphic dating==
Archaeologists investigating a site may wish to date the activity rather than artifacts on site by dating the individual contexts which represents events. Some degree of dating objects by their position in the sequence can be made with known datable elements of the archaeological record or other assumed datable contexts deduced by a regressive form of relative dating which in turn can fix events represented by contexts to some range in time. For example, the date of formation of a context which is totally sealed between two datable layers will fall between the dates of the two layers sealing it. However the date of contexts often fall in a range of possibilities so using them to date others is not a straightforward process.
Take the hypothetical section &quot;figure A&quot;. Here we can see 12 contexts, each numbered with a unique context number and whose sequence is represented in the Harris matrix in &quot;figure B&quot;.
# A horizontal layer
# Masonry wall remnant
# Backfill of the wall construction trench (sometimes called construction cut)
# A horizontal layer, probably the same as 1
# Construction cut for wall 2
# A clay floor abutting wall 2
# Fill of shallow cut 8
# Shallow pit cut
# A horizontal layer
# A horizontal layer, probably the same as 9
# Natural sterile ground formed before human occupation of the site
# Trample in the base of cut 5 formed by workmen&#x27;s boots constructing the structure wall 2 and floor 6 is associated with.
If we know the date of context 1 and context 9 we can deduce that context 7, the backfilling of pit 8, occurred sometime after the date for 9 but before the date for 1, and if we recover an assemblage of artifacts from context 7 that occur nowhere else in the sequence, we have isolated them with a reasonable degree of certainty to a discrete range of time. In this instance we can now use the date we have for finds in context 7 to date other sites and sequences. In practice a huge amount of cross referencing with other recorded sequences is required to produce dating series from stratigraphic relationships such as the work in seriation.

===Residual and intrusive finds===
One issue in using stratigraphic relationships is that the date of artifacts in a context does not represent the date of the context, but just the earliest date the context could be. If one looks at the sequence in &quot;figure A&quot;, one may find that the cut for the construction of wall 2, context 5, has cut through layers 9 and 10, and in doing so has introduced the possibility that artifacts from layers 9 and 10 may be redeposited higher up the sequence in the context representing the backfill of the construction cut, context 3. These artifacts are referred to as &quot;residual&quot; or &quot;residual finds&quot;. It is crucial that dating a context is based on the latest dating evidence drawn from the context. We can also see that if the fill of cut 5 – the wall 2, backfill 3 and trample 12 — are not removed entirely during excavation because of &quot;undercutting&quot;, non-residual artifacts from these later &quot;higher&quot; contexts 2, 3 and 12 could contaminate the excavation of earlier contexts such as 9 and 10 and give false dating information. These artifacts may be termed &quot;intrusive finds&quot;.

===Archiving Stratigraphic Data===
Stratigraphic data is a required component in archaeological archives, but there is a growing problem for digital data archives, where stratigraphic data are often only held on paper or as scanned image copies (PDFs) of matrix diagrams. This means that they cannot be easily re-used in further analysis. Some recommendations are being made to address this problem.

<text>William Wakatere Jackson (born 1961) is a New Zealand politician and former unionist, broadcaster and Urban Māori leader. He was a Member of Parliament for the Alliance from 1999 to 2002 and is currently a Labour Party MP, having been re-elected in 2017.

Jackson was Minister of Employment, Minister for Māori Development, and Minister of Broadcasting and Media in the Sixth Labour Government.

==Early life and family==
Jackson was born in 1961, the eldest of three children to Dame Temuranga “June” Batley-Jackson (Ngāti Maniapoto) and Bob Jackson (Ngāti Porou). Bob Jackson&#x27;s brothers were activist Syd Jackson and lawyer Moana Jackson; their father was All Black Everard Jackson. Bob and June were a dockworker and a cleaner but became leaders of the Urban Māori movement in the 1970s and 1980s. Although Bob spoke te reo Māori as his first language, he did not pass it on to his children and Willie Jackson learned it as an adult through immersion classes.

Willie Jackson has both Māori and Pākehā ancestry and grew up in Porirua until the age of 10, when the family moved to Māngere. He describes himself as having been &quot;a failure at school&quot; and after leaving Mangere College became a freezing worker.

Jackson married the singer Moana Maniapoto, whose band he managed; they divorced in 2001. His second wife is Tania Rangiheuea, a former Victoria University of Wellington lecturer and school principal. Jackson has three children, including journalist Hikurangi Jackson.

== Early career ==
After leaving school, Jackson became a freezing worker, where he became involved with trade unions. By age 21, he was president of the freezing workers union and the youngest union leader in the country. At 25, Jackson became an organiser at the Northern Clerical Workers’ Union where he worked with his uncle Syd Jackson and future New Zealand First MP Tau Henare.

In the 1990s, Jackson became a partner at Tangata Records, a label that promoted and developed contemporary Māori music. He managed Moana and the Moahunters, a band fronted by his then-wife Moana Maniapoto. He was also a sports and Māori radio broadcaster on Radio Aotearoa and the manager of All Black Frank Bunce.

Jackson&#x27;s mother established the Manukau Urban Maori Authority (MUMA) in 1986. He was a spokesperson for MUMA through the fisheries settlements of the 1990s, criticising the proposed allocation of fisheries resources only to iwi because it would disadvantage Urban Māori. With John Tamihere of the West Auckland urban Māori trust Te Whanau o Waipareira, he brought an unsuccessful court case to stop the allocations going ahead in 1997/98.

==Mana Motuhake and the Alliance==



In 1995, Jackson joined the Mana Motuhake party, a Māori party which formed part of the Alliance. He was a candidate for the Alliance in the 1996 election, ranked 20 on the party list and contesting the Manurewa electorate. Jackson&#x27;s list placement was controversial because he had been ranked eighth of eight Mana Motuhake candidates to be integrated within the combined party list of 65 candidates—an unelectable position. However, the NewLabour component party of the Alliance considered Jackson &quot;one of the most talented new candidates&quot; and enabled him to change his affiliation at the last moment, enabling him to be placed higher. Despite the change, he was not elected.

Jackson returned to Mana Motuhake as its national director ahead of the 1999 general election. He was the Alliance candidate in the new Māori electorate of Hauraki, where he lost to his friend and fellow urban Māori advocate John Tamihere of the Labour Party. Ranked ninth on the Alliance party list—the highest of any candidate who was not already in Parliament—Jackson was elected as a list MP. From 1999 to 2002, he was deputy chair of the Māori affairs committee and also sat on the transport and industrial relations committee. His maiden speech, given on 8 February 2000, seconded the address in reply debate and set out his views on the socio-economic disparities between Māori and Pākehā:

In his term in Parliament, Jackson was an outspoken advocate for Māori broadcasting. In his maiden speech, he said his aim was to have &quot;a professional Maori broadcasting system that is well planned, properly resourced, and capable of encompassing all facets of Maori language and culture.&quot; He was critical of the Labour government&#x27;s inaction on the creation of a state-funded Māori television service but won a victory when the Government changed course to allow a pan-Māori authority to control part of the 3G radiowave spectrum.

In 2001, Jackson successfully challenged Mana Motuhake leader Sandra Lee for the leadership of the party within the Alliance. When the Alliance began to collapse in 2002, Jackson sided with the faction led by Laila Harré and Matt McCarten, and remained with the party when Jim Anderton established his breakaway group. In the 2002 election, Jackson became deputy leader of the Alliance under Harré&#x27;s leadership, but the Alliance failed to win any seats. Mana Motuhake withdrew from the Alliance after the election and Jackson resigned the party leadership in 2003.

==Return to broadcasting==
After losing his re-election bid at the 2002 general election, Jackson returned to his broadcasting career. He became general manager of Radio Waatea, and later the chief executive of Urban Māori Broadcasting, and was the host of two television current affairs programmes. &quot;Eye to Eye with Willie Jackson&quot; aired on TV One from 2004 to 2009. From 2009, Jackson moved to Māori Television where he hosted &quot;Willie Jackson&#x27;s Newsbites&quot; until 2011. As an interviewer, Jackson was praised by Bill Ralston, who said that Jackson knew how to get the best out of his guests.

A hosting partnership between Jackson and John Tamihere began in 2006 with an afternoon talkback programme on Radio Live; this ran until it was ended by the Roast Busters scandal in 2013. The duo also co-hosted &quot;The World According to Willie and JT&quot; on TV One in 2007. Jackson returned to Radio Live in 2014, co-hosting the afternoon programme with Alison Mau. He resigned from Radio Live in early 2017 after being announced as a Labour Party candidate in the 2017 general election.

== Return to advocacy and politics ==
Jackson remained involved in politics after his 2002 defeat. He unsuccessfully attempted to create a pan-Māori party between 2002 and 2003, then became an early supporter of Tariana Turia&#x27;s Māori Party. A bid to become Mayor of Manukau City in 2007 was unsuccessful, with Jackson placing fourth in a crowded field that also included Len Brown, Dick Quax, and Arthur Anae. After Hone Harawira split from the Māori Party in 2011, Jackson became a supporter of the Mana Movement and an advocate for political peace between the two Māori parties. Jackson considered standing for the Mana Movement in Tāmaki Makaurau at the 2011 election, but declined to run.

Jackson was elected the first chair of the National Urban Māori Authority (NUMA) in 2003 and succeeded his mother as chief executive of the Manukau Urban Māori Authority (MUMA) in 2009. He left those leadership roles after being re-elected to Parliament in 2017. During Jackson&#x27;s tenure leading these organisations, NUMA won a bid to be the North Island Whānau Ora commissioning agency in 2014 and a subsidiary of MUMA won the contract for a South Auckland charter school in 2017.

==Labour Party==

=== Sixth Labour Government, 2017–2023 ===
Jackson was recruited by Labour Party leader Andrew Little to stand as a Labour candidate and run the party&#x27;s campaign for the Māori electorates in the 2017 general election. As Māori campaign manager, Jackson called for the Green Party to withdraw some of its candidates so that Labour would have a stronger chance of winning its own races, but was rebuffed by his own leader. Nonetheless, Labour won all seven Māori electorates. Jackson, who had stood as a list-only candidate, was elected as a Labour Party list MP.

Following post-election negotiations between Labour, New Zealand First and the Greens and the formation of a coalition government, Jackson was appointed the Minister of Employment and Associate Minister for Māori Development (outside Cabinet). He also sat on the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee. After Jackson was re-elected in the 2020 general election, he was elevated to the Cabinet as Minister for Māori Development and given the associate portfolios for the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and justice. He also held the internal Labour Party office of co-chair of the Māori caucus.

In late November 2021, Jackson apologised to the Moriori on behalf of Ngāti Tama and Ngāti Mutunga for his ancestors&#x27; role in the Moriori genocide. This apology accompanied the passage of the Moriori Claims Settlements Bill, which formalised the New Zealand Government&#x27;s financial compensation settlement to the Moriori within the framework of the Treaty of Waitangi.

In early December 2021, Jackson was ejected from the New Zealand Parliament debating chamber for refusing to apologise after National Party MP Maureen Pugh had objected to him calling the ACT party &quot;right-wing fascists.&quot; Jackson had made these remarks during a debate on a bill to include two Ngāi Tahu representatives on the Canterbury Regional Council after the 2022 New Zealand local elections.

In a June 2022 reshuffle, Jackson was also appointed Minister of Broadcasting and Media. As Broadcasting Minister, Jackson introduced draft legislation to merge the public broadcasters Radio New Zealand and TVNZ into a new non-profit autonomous Crown entity called Aotearoa New Zealand Public Media (ANZPM). During a live television interview with TVNZ journalist Jack Tame on TVNZ&#x27;s &quot;Q+A&quot; in December 2022, Jackson defended the Government&#x27;s public media merger efforts particularly its commitment to editorial independence and questioned the motives and impartiality of his host. In response, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern expressed disagreement with Jackson&#x27;s remarks but defended his competence as Minister of Broadcasting. The interview was described as &quot;a trainwreck&quot; by the National Party&#x27;s broadcasting spokesperson Melissa Lee and Jackson&#x27;s apologised for his conduct on 6 December, but defended the public media merger and accused the New Zealand media of fomenting opposition to the merger effort. The merger was cancelled two months later.

===Opposition, 2023–present===
During the 2023 New Zealand general election held on 14 October, Jackson was re-elected to Parliament on the Labour party list. He again led Labour&#x27;s campaign strategy for the Māori electorates, but was unsuccessful with only one seat being won by Labour. Jackson said he considered quitting politics after the election, but decided to stay on for the term.

In early November 2023, Jackson stated that Māori people would &quot;go to war&quot; if the incoming Sixth National Government proceeded with an ACT campaign promise to hold a referendum on redefining the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. In response to Jackson&#x27;s remarks, ACT leader David Seymour reiterated that ACT wanted a &quot;rational debate&quot; on the topic and stated that &quot;when people threaten war as the alternative to that, they are not being a good actor investing in the future of our country.&quot;

In late November 2023, Jackson assumed the Māori Development, broadcasting and media, employment and associate housing and associate workplace relations and safety portfolios in the Shadow Cabinet of Chris Hipkins.

On 5 December 2023, Jackson was granted retention of the title &quot;The Honourable&quot;, in recognition of his term as a member of the Executive Council.

In late May 2024, Jackson participated in an Oxford Union debate where he delivered a winning speech calling for the return of seven &quot;mokomōkai&quot; (preserved Māori heads adorned with customary Māori tattoos known as &quot;moko&quot;) from the British Museum. His speech also criticised the legacy of British colonialism in New Zealand.

In November 2024, Jackson was again ejected from the New Zealand Parliament debating chamber, after calling ACT Party Leader David Seymour a liar during the first reading of the Treaty Principles Bill. He later said at the 2024 Labour Party Annual conference that if he is &quot;not a liar&quot;, then he is a &quot;special kind of stupid that I have never seen before.&quot;

<text>Jurbarkas (; Samogitian: &quot;Jorbarks&quot;, known also by several alternative names) is a city in Tauragė County, in Samogitia, Lithuania. Jurbarkas is located in the historic land of Karšuva. It is on the right-hand shore of the Nemunas at its confluence with the tributaries Mituva and Imsrė. The town became an important road junction after a bridge was built over the Nemunas in 1978.

== Etymology ==
The name Jurbarkas is derived from the Ordensburg castle, &quot;Georgenburg&quot;, built in the 13th century.

Jurbarkas has also been known by many derivate spellings in various languages throughout its history. The most notable non-Lithuanian names for the city include: in Samogitian &quot;Jorbarks&quot;, in German &quot;Georgenburg&quot;, &quot;Jurgenburg&quot;, and &quot;Eurburg&quot;, in Polish, &quot;Jurbork&quot;, and in Yiddish יורבורג (&quot;Yurburg&quot;).

== History ==

Although Jurbarkas is said to have been a seat of Lithuanian princes from the Palemonids legend, it was first documented in 1259 as the Teutonic Knights&#x27; &quot;Ordensburg&quot; castle of &quot;Georgenburg&quot; (&quot;George&#x27;s castle&quot;) southwest from the confluence of Mituva and Nemunas. This castle was constructed west of the current town on a hill now known as Bišpiliukai, while the Lithuanians built a castle on Bišpilis hill by the river Imsrė.

The castle of Georgenburg was destroyed by the Grand Duke Vytautas in 1403 and was never rebuilt. The region was included within Lithuania in the Treaty of Melno in 1422, and the current site of Jurbarkas began to develop as a town and customs point, growing through the exporting of lumber on the Nemunas to Ducal Prussia. In 1430 a first church was built. Around 1540 new settlement have risen, in 1545 new church and parish primary school was built. In 1561 Jurbarkas comprised 82 houses. In 1569 Jurbarkas had about 600 inhabitants, small shops and inns, market place was present. In 1586 famous chronicler Maciej Stryjkowski became a church provost in Jurbarkas. King Sigismund III Vasa granted Jurbarkas its Magdeburg rights in 1611. In 1673 Jurbarkas comprised 56 houses.

In 1795 Jurbarkas was annexed by the Russian Empire during the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and was part of Vilna Governorate, later a part of Kovno Governorate (1843–1915). Its growth stagnated during the 19th century as traffic on the Nemunas decreased because of the rise of railways. The town was briefly liberated from the occupying Russian forces by the insurgents during the November Uprising in 1831. Because of its riverside location, Jurbarkas often suffered from floods (notably in 1862). 120 houses burned down from a fire in 1906.

Soviet occupants deported 78 residents of Jurbarkas in 1941–51. During the years of Lithuanian anti-Soviet partisan resistance (1944–1953) in Jurbarkas and neighbouring districts Lithuanian &quot;Laisvės gynėjų rinktinė&quot; (&quot;The Freedom Defenders Squad&quot;), belonging to partisans&#x27; Kęstutis military district was active.
==Jewish community ==

Jurbarkas was for centuries a multi-ethnic community. During the 17th century some of the town&#x27;s Jewish population were employed as tax collectors for the Lithuanian government. By 1714 Jubarkas had 2,333 Jews. By 1790 the town had a Jewish cemetery and a Wooden synagogue, one of the oldest in the region. In 1862 there were 2,550 Jews. In 1843 Emperor Nicholas I ordered that Jews living within of the Empire&#x27;s western border should relocate eastward, but Jurbarkas was one of 19 towns which disobeyed the order. The Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) prospered in Jurbarkas.

Many of the town&#x27;s citizens left during World War I, although some returned. It became part of Raseiniai County in the independent Lithuania created after the war. The population decreased from 7,391 in 1897 to 4,409 in 1923. The Jewish population decreased over the same period from 2,350 to 1,887, though that represented an increase from 32% to 43%. A government census in Jurbarkas in 1931 indicated that Jews owned 69 of 75 business and 18 of 19 light industries.

The Soviet Union occupied the town in 1940 during World War II and nationalized many of the Jewish-owned companies. Jewish cultural organizations were also suppressed. Jurbarkas was invaded by Nazi Germany on 22 June 1941, the first day of Operation Barbarossa. Among other persecutions, Lithuanian collaborators forced the Jews to destroy the wooden synagogue. The Jewish population of Jurbarkas was systematically killed in 1941. A few dozen Jews from the town and escapees from the Kaunas Ghetto formed a partisan group to attack Nazi forces, although the majority were killed. A monument at the mass graves was constructed after the war to honor the Holocaust victims.
Few of Jurbarkas Jewish citizens survived World War II. Of those that did, some remained in Vilnius or Kaunas after the War, while most emigrated to Palestine, the US, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Germany, or other nations – in some cases joining family and friends who had left Lithuania before the War.

<doc id="1082198" wikidata="Q737265" url="?curid=1082198" title="Nicky Cruz">
<text>Nicky Cruz (born December 6, 1938) is a Puerto Rican Christian evangelist, the founder of Nicky Cruz Outreach, an evangelistic Christian ministry. He was also once the director of Teen Challenge, serving under David Wilkerson before founding another ministry home himself in California. Prior to his conversion he was the leader of a New York City gang, the Mau Maus.

==Early life==
Cruz was born in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico where he was raised by his parents. His parents practiced brujeria and were followers of spiritism (&quot;espiritismo&quot;). They mentally abused him; his own mother would call him &quot;Son of Satan&quot;. The neighborhood in which he lived was one of the worst in Puerto Rico and Cruz was always getting into trouble. According to his book &quot;Run Baby Run&quot;, his parents sent him to live with his brother in New York City when he was 15, and Cruz soon ran away and started living on the streets of the city. He became a member of the Mau Maus street gang, and about six months later Cruz was selected Warlord of the gang. He quickly rose to become their president.

==Conversion to Christianity==
Shortly after Cruz became the gang leader, David Wilkerson was preaching in the neighborhood when Cruz encountered him. The preacher told Cruz that &quot;Jesus loved him and would never stop loving him&quot;. Cruz responded by slapping Wilkerson and threatening to kill him. Wilkerson attempted again later to convert Cruz, and received the same response.

Later, Wilkerson organised an evangelistic meeting in the neighborhood with the intent of converting the Mau Maus. When Cruz heard about it, he headed with some of the members of his gang for the boxing arena where the meeting was being held, on a bus sent specially by Wilkerson. According to Cruz, when he arrived at the arena, he &quot;felt guilty about the things that he had done&quot; and began to pray. After preaching, Wilkerson asked the Mau Maus to take up a collection. Cruz volunteered and led a group of the gang through the crowd, insisting on people giving money. Going backstage, he saw an exit, but convinced the group to give the money to Wilkerson on stage. Later, Wilkerson gave an altar call, and a large number of gang members responded. Wilkerson prayed with Cruz, and Cruz asked God to forgive him.

Afterward, Cruz and some of the gang members who were converted went to the police and turned in all of their bricks, handguns and knives, shocking the police officers in the station. They stated that if they had seen the group approaching, they probably would have shot them down. Cruz began to study the Bible and went to Bible college. He became a preacher and returned to his old neighborhood, where he preached and converted more of the Mau Maus to Christianity, including the gang&#x27;s new leader, Israel Narvaez.

==Written works==
Nicky Cruz has written two autobiographies, &quot;Run Baby Run&quot;, with Jamie Buckingham (1968), and &quot;Soul Obsession&quot;, with Frank Martin (2005). He has also written several books with a Christian theme, including &quot;The Corruptors&quot; (1974), &quot;The Magnificent Three&quot; (1976), and &quot;Destined to Win&quot; (1991). Cruz&#x27;s conversion was depicted in the 1970 film &quot;The Cross and the Switchblade&quot; starring Erik Estrada as Cruz and Pat Boone as David Wilkerson. In 2013, Cruz authored &quot;The Devil Has No Mother&quot; which shares Cruz&#x27;s understanding of the devil&#x27;s hunger to gain power, but contrasts this with God&#x27;s ability to nevertheless win the day.

<text>Coronet Peak is a commercial skifield in Queenstown, New Zealand located seven kilometres west of Arrowtown, on the southern slopes of the 1,649-metre peak which shares its name. A popular ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere, Coronet Peak offers a long snow season, well received skiing and snowboarding terrain and lift systems.

==Location==
The Peak is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most popular ski resorts due to its proximity to Queenstown, varied terrain and quality facilities, offering two high speed six-seater chairlifts and a high speed beginner chairlift. The view from the skifield south across Lake Wakatipu and the smaller nearby Lake Hayes is a further contributor to the mountain&#x27;s success. Dubbed the &quot;original&quot; resort ski area Coronet Peak is only 25 minutes from Queenstown.

==Facilities==
Coronet Peak has extensive snowmaking and receives about 2 m of snow per year. The season typically runs from early June to early-October or late-September. It is one of the only skifields in New Zealand to offer night skiing on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights from July to mid-September and First Tracks, operating between 8-9am offer a more secluded period before the main traffic hits later on during the day. Coronet Peak (and nearby mountains) are popular locations for school trips because of their extensive facilities. Children 6 and younger receive free day lift passes.

==Lifts==
Coronet Peak has a lifts system consisting of a combined six seater chairlift and gondola, the Coronet Express, as well as two detachable chairlifts, the six seater Greengages express and the Meadows Express quad, as well as a T bar. There are also three magic carpet lifts in the beginner area. The lifts can transport 9000 people per hour combined.
==Ski terrain==

Popular runs on Coronet Peak include Big Easy (beginners), M1, Greengates and Shirtfront (intermediate), and Exchange Drop and the Back Bowls (expert). Like European Alpine ski resorts, Coronet&#x27;s Peak offers much well-developed piste skiing.

==Events==
Coronet Peak is often the site of calendared international ski races and the training ground for many world class athletes.

==Operations==
The field is operated by NZSki Ltd, who also manages The Remarkables skifield just across the valley and Mount Hutt in Canterbury, near to Christchurch.

==History==
The field was New Zealand&#x27;s first commercial skifield, and was opened in 1947 with a single rope tow. Tourism pioneer Harry Wigley of Mt Cook airline fame commissioned Bill Hamilton to design and build this lift.

As visitor numbers grew, the field introduced New Zealand&#x27;s first double then treble chairlifts and in 1994, the second high-speed quad chairlift.

In 2002 the Mount Cook Group sold Coronet Peak and The Remarkables to a consortium of Queenstown businesspeople, now NZSki Ltd, who also bought Mount Hutt.

For the 2008 season NZSki Ltd invested over $30 million on a new base building and 141 new snow cannons. 

The 2009 season opened with new snowmaking equipment, new piste groomers, and a dedicated children&#x27;s lift.

The 2010 season saw the Meadows double chairlift replaced with a detachable quad chairlift featuring a self lowering safety bar and child friendly restraints.

<text>The Wabash Confederacy, also referred to as the Wabash Indians or the Wabash tribes, was a number of 18th century Native American villagers in the area of the Wabash River in what are now the U.S. states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. The Wabash Indians were primarily the Miami, Weas and Piankashaws, but also included Kickapoos, Mascoutens, and others. In that time and place, Native American tribes were smaller political units, and the villages along the Wabash were multi-tribal settlements with no centralized government. The confederacy, then, was a loose alliance of influential village leaders (sometimes called headmen or chiefs).

In the 1780s, headmen of the Wabash Confederacy allied themselves with a larger, loose confederacy of Native American leaders in the Ohio Country and Illinois Country known as the Northwestern Confederacy, in order to collectively resist U.S. expansion after the American Revolutionary War. In 1786, a Wyandot messenger named Scotosh warned Congress that the Wabash, Twightwee, and Miami nations would disrupt U.S. surveyors, and Congress promised reprisals if that occurred. This resistance movement culminated with the Northwest Indian War. The alliance with the Western Confederacy ended in 1792 with the Wabash Confederacy signed a treaty with the United States.

<doc id="1082212" wikidata="Q2599592" url="?curid=1082212" title="Yaquina Bay Bridge">
<text>The Yaquina Bay Bridge is an arch bridge that spans Yaquina Bay south of Newport, Oregon. It is one of the most recognizable of the U.S. Route 101 bridges designed by Conde McCullough and one of eleven major bridges on the Oregon Coast Highway designed by him. It superseded the last ferry crossing on the highway.

==History==
Work on the Yaquina Bay Bridge began on August 1, 1934. The bridge opened on September 6, 1936, at a cost of $1,301,016 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars). A total of 220 people worked to pour 30,000 cubic yards (23,000 m3) of concrete and fabricate 3,100 tons of steel. The contractors were the Gilpin Construction Company of Portland, Oregon, and the General Construction Company of Seattle, Washington. The main arch was built in toward the center from the anchorages, using tiebacks to support the arch until it could be closed. The piers are supported by timber pilings driven to a depth of about below sea level. The project received funding from the Public Works Administration.

==Description==
The main span is a semi-through arch, with the roadway penetrating the middle of the arch. It is flanked by identical steel deck arches, with five concrete deck arches of diminishing size extending to the south landing. The main arch is marked by tall obelisk-like concrete finials on the main piers, with smaller decorative elements marking the ends of the flanking spans. The arches are built as box girders. The two-lane road is wide, running inside the arches with two sidewalks. The main arch is above sea level at its crown. Overall length of the bridge is , including concrete deck-girder approach spans. The navigable channel measures wide by high.

The bridge uses Art Deco and Art Moderne design motifs as well as forms borrowed from Gothic architecture. The Gothic influence is seen in the balustrade, which features small pointed arches, and in the arches of the side span piers. The ends of the bridge are augmented by pedestrian plazas that afford a view of the bridge and provide access to the parks at the landings by stairways. Pedestals were provided for proposed sculptures of seals, but the statues were never executed.

==Designation==
The Yaquina Bay Bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 2005.

<text>MagicPoint is one of several open-source presentation programs, often used to produce slides for conferences. Unlike most presentation programs, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, where a GUI is used to create slides, MagicPoint slides are created by writing text files using a simple markup language. The resulting file is then displayed with MagicPoint&#x27;s X11-based viewer.

== History ==
MagicPoint was originally created in the autumn of 1997, at a WIDE Project camp. It was originally known as tp, standing for TinyPoint, but in December the name was changed to MagicPoint.

== Features ==
* Content is written in text files and formatting is indicated by text features. For example, different level bullet points can be created by simply indenting the text with tabs
* Many image formats are supported
* Slides can be scaled to different screen sizes
* External applications can be executed from inside the presentation
* A talk timer and slide guide are included
* Presentations can be exported to HTML or PostScript files.
Another feature of MagicPoint is the ability to draw on slides during a presentation. By pressing x on the keyboard, the slide can temporarily be scribbled on with red &quot;ink&quot;. Shift x allows you to cycle through other pen colours.

<text>St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal [[Cathedral]] in Seattle, Washington, is the seat of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia. St. Mark&#x27;s was founded as a mission church of Trinity Parish Church.

==History==

Plans for the building, located on the west side of 10th Avenue East between East Highland Drive and East Galer Street on Capitol Hill, were drawn up in 1926. Fundraising took place for two years until construction began in 1928. Ground was broken on September 30, 1928. The Great Depression took a toll on the parish, however. Construction was incomplete when the cathedral was dedicated on April 25, 1931, and the parish was in default on its mortgage throughout the 1930s. The cathedral was foreclosed upon in 1941 and shut for the next two years. From 1943 to 1944, the United States Army used the cathedral as an anti-aircraft training facility; the evidence of this era can still be seen in murals in the crypt.

In 1944, Bishop S. Arthur Huston reopened discussions with the parish&#x27;s bankers in St. Louis, Missouri; over the next three years, more funds were raised, and in 1947 the mortgage was paid. The mortgage document was burned before the Parish on Palm Sunday.

The cathedral&#x27;s dean, Robert V. Taylor, resigned abruptly in March 2008, stating that he and the vestry (church board) diverged in their visions for the future of St. Mark&#x27;s and there was a loss of trust between them.

After several years of transitional ministry, Taylor was succeeded by Steven Lynn Thomason in the summer of 2012.

Thomason shares clerical ministry with the Rev. Canon Emily A. Griffin as Vicar, the Rev. Canon Richard C. Weyls as associate rector, the Rev. Earl Grout as deacon, and a handful of non-stipendiary priests. 

==Location==

St. Mark&#x27;s Cathedral is located at the top of a very steep drop-off to Lakeview Boulevard East below. The wooded hillside is known as the St. Mark&#x27;s Greenbelt.

==Organ==

The choir loft of St. Mark&#x27;s is home to one of the largest pipe organs in Seattle. The organ was built in 1965 by D. A. Flentrop (Zaandam, Netherlands) and restored in 1993-1994 and 2001 by Paul Fritts &amp; Company Organ Builders, Tacoma. Further additions followed in 1995 (new chorus reeds 16&#x27; and 8&#x27; in Manual II) and 1996 (Zymbelstern). In 2011, Paul Fritts installed new horizontal reed stops (the former horizontal trumpets from 1965 were stored). The instrument has 58 stops/79 ranks on four manuals/pedal, and contains 3,944 pipes. The current organists are Michael Kleinschmidt (Canon Musician), and John Stuntebeck (Associate Organist).

<text>Wendake () is the current name for two urban reserves, Wendake 7 () and Wendake 7A, () of the Huron-Wendat Nation in the Canadian province of Quebec. They are enclaves entirely surrounded by the La Haute-Saint-Charles borough of Quebec City, within the former city of Loretteville. One of the Seven Nations of Canada, the settlement was formerly known as &quot;Village-des-Hurons&quot; (&quot;Huron Village&quot;), and also as &quot;(Jeune)-Lorette&quot; (&quot;New Lorette&quot;).

Since the late 20th century, archeologists have found large 16th-century villages of the Wendat (Huron) in the northern Lake Ontario region, which is where they believe the people coalesced as a distinct group. Later they migrated south and by the early 17th century had settled in their historical territory of Wendake in the Georgian Bay region. The Wyandot Confederation was made up of loosely associated tribes who spoke a mutually intelligible Iroquoian language.

==History==

Archeologists have excavated 16th-century settlements north of Lake Ontario at the Mantle Site (2005), Aurora Site and Ratcliff Site in Whitchurch-Stouffville, Ontario, all attesting to distinctly Wendat (Huron) occupancy. They have concluded the people coalesced in this area as a distinct group. Later they migrated to the Georgian Bay area, where they encountered Europeans in the 17th century.

Until the middle of the 17th century, the Wendake ancestors occupied a vast territory straddling part of what is now the United States (from Detroit to south-eastern Ontario (Penetanguishene and Midland) and Quebec. They hunted and trapped throughout this territory (mainly in the Laurentian Mountains, between the central section of the Saint-Maurice and the Saguenay rivers).

Between 1634 and 1650, the Wyandot Confederation was dismembered; its families, having been gathered into four or five tribes, were dispersed. It is estimated that the Huron population totalled approximately 20,000 to 30,000 people in 1634. By 1650, only a few hundred individuals remained. Most had been decimated by infectious disease epidemics, to which they had no natural immunity; survivors were attacked by wars, especially by the Iroquois Confederacy, who pushed from the south (present-day New York) trying to control hunting grounds and the fur trade.

Part of the Huron population had also been integrated into the Iroquois Confederation. The survivors of this tragic period divided into two groups in Canada: the Great-Lake Wyandot and the Huron-Wendat. The latter were the ancestors of the Huron-Wendat of Wendake. This marked the beginning of a period of exile for the 300 or so Wendat who remained, an era during which they would occupy as many as six different sites in the province of Quebec. They finally settled for good in the village of Lorette in 1697. First established on Île d&#x27;Orléans in 1651, the community moved to Quebec City in 1668. Subsequently, the Wendat temporarily resided in Beauport, Notre Dame de Foy, L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette and then New Lorette in 1673.

As of the 2016 Canadian census the population of the two reserves was 2,135 people and the Huron-Wendat Nation has a total of 4,314 registered members, most of which live off reserve. Wendake 7 occupies an area of and Wendake 7A for a total of .

As of 2021, the Grand Chief is Rémy Vincent and previous chiefs include Konrad Sioui, who succeeded Max Gros-Louis in 2008.

The Huron had called their historic homeland Wendake; it was the territory south of Georgian Bay in present-day Simcoe and Grey County counties. The region was informally known as &quot;Huronia&quot; or the Georgian Triangle. A very large 15th-century Huron-Wendat settlement (the Mantle Site) has recently been discovered in Whitchurch–Stouffville. Its discovery has added to archeologists and anthropologists believing that the Wendat arose as a people in this area.

Other remnants of the Wendat and Petun peoples formed the Wyandot and migrated south, to present-day Michigan. Later they were forced west of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory in Kansas and Oklahoma. In the United States, there is one federally recognized Wyandot tribe: the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma. The self-identified Wyandot Nation of Kansas and Wyandot Nation of Anderdon in Michigan are not federally recognized. In August 1999, these nations joined the contemporary Wendat Confederacy, pledging to provide mutual aid to each other in a spirit of peace, kinship, and unity.

<doc id="1082226" wikidata="Q7588439" url="?curid=1082226" title="St. James Cathedral (Seattle)">
<text>St. James Cathedral is a Catholic cathedral located at 804 Ninth Avenue in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. It is the mother church of the Archdiocese of Seattle and the seat of its archbishop, currently Paul D. Etienne. The cathedral is named for St. James the Greater, patron saint of the archdiocese, and is the third church in the territory presently known as the Archdiocese of Seattle to bear the name.

The need for a cathedral in Seattle arose in 1903 when Edward O&#x27;Dea, bishop of what was then known as the Diocese of Nesqually (later spelled &quot;Nisqually&quot;), elected to move the Episcopal see from Vancouver, Washington, to Seattle. Construction began in 1905. The cathedral was dedicated in 1907. In 1916, the cathedral underwent major renovations as a result of the collapse of its dome; other significant renovations were completed in 1950 and 1994. The cathedral, rectory, and site were designated city landmarks in 1984.

==History==
The Diocese of Nesqually was established in Vancouver, Washington, on May 31, 1850, by Pope Pius IX. The new diocese&#x27;s territory was carved from the former Diocese of Walla Walla, which had been abandoned and its territory administered from Oregon City in the wake of the Whitman massacre. Augustin-Magloire Blanchet, the first bishop of the new diocese, dedicated a cathedral in honor of Saints James and Augustine within Fort Vancouver on January 23, 1851.

Blanchet&#x27;s successor, Aegidius Junger, set out to build a new St. James Cathedral in Vancouver. This building, which was completed in 1885, served as the cathedral for eighteen years and remains a Catholic church to the present day. Junger&#x27;s successor, Edward O&#x27;Dea, realized that Vancouver&#x27;s importance as an economic and population center was waning and at the urging of Reverend Francis X. Prefontaine, a priest in rapidly growing Seattle, O&#x27;Dea moved the episcopal see to Seattle in 1903, and immediately laid plans to build a new cathedral.

O&#x27;Dea purchased the current cathedral site in 1903; planning began in 1904, and construction began in early 1905. The laying of the cornerstone of the cathedral took place on November 12, 1905, in the presence of more than five thousand people. It was said to be the largest religious gathering in Seattle up to that time. While the cathedral was under construction, a small temporary structure, St. Edward&#x27;s Chapel, served as the pro-cathedral for Bishop O&#x27;Dea. It was designed by Seattle architect James Stephen and was located on the cathedral block, at the corner of Terry Avenue and Columbia Street. The Diocese of Nisqually was officially renamed the Diocese of Seattle on September 11, 1907, and the cathedral was dedicated on December 22 of that year.

On February 2, 1916, the 60-foot dome that crowned the cathedral collapsed under the weight of heavy snow accumulation. The dome was never rebuilt, and when the cathedral reopened on March 18, 1917, the interior had changed dramatically. Another major renovation took place in 1950, marking the centennial of the diocese. In 1984, the Seattle City Council designated the cathedral, rectory, and grounds as a city landmark.

In 1994, the cathedral underwent its most recent major restoration and renovation, which sought to incorporate changes supposedly brought about by the Second Vatican Council. The liturgical design consultant for the renovation was Father Richard S. Vosko, a priest of the Diocese of Albany who has overseen the controversial redesign and renovation of numerous churches and cathedrals around the country. These changes included moving the altar from its original location at the east end of the cathedral to the crossing at the center of the building. The renovation also included the installation of an oculus and skylight above the new altar, where the dome had been. As part of the 1994 renovation, relics of St. Frances Xavier Cabrini were sealed beneath the altar; Cabrini had worshiped at the cathedral while she worked in Seattle from 1903 to 1916.

The cathedral today sponsors numerous outreach ministries, to the poor, the homeless, and the marginalized, such as the Cathedral Kitchen, Homeless Ministry &amp; Nightwatch, St. Vincent de Paul, Environmental Justice, Housing Advocacy, and St. James Immigrant Assistance Program. These are operated out of Cathedral Hall and the Pastoral Outreach Center, once the convent of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, who run Holy Names Academy.

== Exterior ==
Major artwork at St. James Cathedral includes an extensive collection of stained glass by Charles Connick, installed in 1917-1920 during the rebuilding of the cathedral following the collapse of the dome. In 1994, three new windows were added, the work of Hans Gottfried von Stockhausen, a noted German stained-glass artist, who has served on the faculty of the Pilchuck School.
In 1999, ceremonial bronze doors were added, the work of German sculptor Ulrich Henn. The central bronze doors portray humanity&#x27;s pilgrimage to the heavenly Jerusalem. Old Testament scenes begin on the bottom left and show the journey of God&#x27;s people: the expulsion from Eden, the sacrifice of Noah with a rainbow symbolizing the covenant, and Moses leading the people through the Red Sea. The right side shows Jesus’ journey, again beginning from the bottom: his baptism in the Jordan, the healing of the man born blind and the paralyzed man, preaching the Beatitudes, the entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday; the betrayal by Judas; the passion and carrying the cross.

In the tympanum above the door, the victorious Lamb of God brings the pilgrimage to its triumphant conclusion in the heavenly city. Rivers flow out of the city, and on the banks spring up trees, covered in fruit for the healing of the nations. Whereas the angel at Eden pointed the way out of paradise, this angel points the way to a new and greater paradise: the Lamb of God enthroned in heaven. A bronze tabernacle by the same artist was installed in 2003. Henn&#x27;s only other works in the United States are the bronze gates at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. 
 Above the west door of the cathedral is a black and gilt window (1950) which shows Christ reaching out his hands in blessing. The text reads: “I am the vine, you are the branches” (John 15). The window celebrates the Pacific Northwest in the regional industries of 1950: fishing, shipping, lumber, and manufacturing, and includes a sketch of Mount Rainier. Vines laden with grapes link the northwestern motif with Christ&#x27;s words.

Above the window, a statue of St. James the Greater, patron of the cathedral, surmounts the west face of the building. The figure of St. John Vianney (d. 1859) stands to the left. This patron saint of parish priests served in the French village of Ars, France. On the right is a statue of St. Frances Xavier Cabrini (d. 1917), first American citizen to be canonized. She worshipped in St. James Cathedral in its early years, when her missionary travels brought her to Seattle to serve Italian immigrants. All three of the façade statues were added as part of the 1950 renovation.

== Interior ==
The west vestibule floor contains a mosaic declaring, DOMUS DEI PORTA COELI: “House of God, Gate of Heaven” (Genesis 28:17). Along the walls of this vestibule white marble tablets honor many parishes and individuals who participated in the 1994 renovation and subsequent major projects. A bronze relief of St. Frances Cabrini recalls the fact that she became a citizen of the United States in Seattle. Tablets to the right of the main doors recognize other donors. Tablets on the east wall of the vestibule list the bishops of the Archdiocese of Seattle and the pastors of the cathedral. 

The baptistery and font are directly inside the west doors of the cathedral. The font is inscribed with the Chi Rho (XP), an ancient Greek abbreviation for the name Christ. Infants are baptized in the font throughout the year, while older children and adults descend into the pool to be baptized at the Easter Vigil. The inscription surrounding the baptistery expands on the text in the vestibule, stating “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of God who called you out of darkness into marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9). The pool&#x27;s classical quatrefoil shape echoes the shape of the cathedral itself. Along the north wall stands the most recent addition to the cathedral&#x27;s devotional works, a shrine honoring Saint John XXIII, the Pope who called the Second Vatican Council. St. James is the only cathedral in the United States with a shrine honoring this beloved saint. Dedicated in 2012 (when John XXIII had been beatified not yet been canonized), it is the work of Seattle artist John Sisko (d. 2016).
From the Ambo or pulpit the scriptures are proclaimed and the homily preached. Randall Rosenthal, a Jewish sculptor, interpreted the prophet Isaiah: “For just as from the heavens the rain and snow come down and do not return there till they have watered the earth, making it fertile and fruitful, giving seed to the one who sows and bread to the one who eats, so shall my Word be, that goes forth from my mouth; it shall not return to me void, but shall do my will, achieving the end for which I sent it” (Isaiah 55:10, 11). The carving uses northwest imagery in its depiction of clouds, rain, and abundant vegetation.
 The Shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary was designed by parishioner Susan Jones and is meant to evoke the warm and loving darkness of the womb. Following medieval tradition, the stars on the ceiling replicate the heavens as seen above Seattle on the night of December 22, the date of the cathedral&#x27;s dedication. The statue of the Virgin and Child is modeled on a fifteenth-century statue in the German monastery of Blaubeuren.
The cathedral&#x27;s original choir space in the west gallery features an organ built by the Boston firm of Hutchings-Votey (Opus 1623). This organ was installed and voiced by E. M. Skinner in 1907. In 1926 the east apse was converted into an additional choir area when a second organ built by Casavant was installed in the east end. In 2000, the Casavant was replaced with the Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy Millennium Organ, built by Rosales Organ Builders of Los Angeles, California (Opus 30) In addition, there is a two-manual organ by Frank Robl (cathedral chapel), and two portable organs by Laukhuff/Zuckerman and Alfred Führer.

The stained-glass windows in the East Apse are the work of Hans Gottfried von Stockhausen. They incorporate some of Charles Connick&#x27;s 1918 stained glass, which furnish a background for Stockhausen&#x27;s six roundels illustrating the works of mercy from Matthew 25. In an imaginative way, they portray the works of mercy in scenes from the Passion and Resurrection of Christ. The artist&#x27;s hope was that in seeing these scenes from the life of Jesus, people would ask, ‘Where are these things happening today?’ 
From top to bottom:

* Jesus at Emmaus, blessing bread: “I was hungry…”
* Jesus crucified, with a soldier putting a sponge to his lips: “I was thirsty…”
* Women greeting Jesus along the way of the Cross: “I was a stranger…”

The right-hand panel shows: 
* Jesus mockingly clothed in a purple cloak: “I was naked…” 
* Jesus crowned with thorns: “I was sick…”
* Jesus arrested: “I was a prisoner…”

The central window tells the story of baptism. At the top of the window, Christ is baptized by John in the waters of the Jordan, with an angel looking on. In the center, Moses leads the People of Israel through the waters of the Red Sea, a prefiguring of baptism. Finally, at the bottom, in another prefiguring of baptism, Noah floats in the waters of the flood. He reaches toward a dove bearing an olive branch, a sign of life restored. Below that is a golden seed, nurtured by life-giving waters and breaking open to new life. The message written on the seed ties together and makes sense of the two outer windows: “As often as you did it to one of these, the least of my brothers or sisters, you did it to me.”(Matthew 25:40)

== Chapel ==

The cathedral chapel is home to an altarpiece by Florentine artist Neri di Bicci, dating to 1456. It represents the Madonna and Child surrounded by six saints including St. Luke, the physician (with an ox), St. Bartholomew (with the knife used to flay him), St. Lawrence, the Deacon (with the grill on which he was martyred and a palm signifying a martyr&#x27;s victory), St. John the Baptist (who in the painting is depicted proclaiming “Ecce Agnus Dei,” “Behold the Lamb of God”), St. Martin, 4th century Bishop of Tours, and St. Sebastian, Roman martyr put to death by arrows. This subject, common in Renaissance art, is known as a sacra conversazione, a “holy conversation,” as saints of many different times and places are imagined in “conversation” with Mary and Jesus. The painting underwent a major restoration in 2005 at the Seattle Art Museum, where it was featured as the centerpiece of an exhibit on devotional art of the Renaissance. The original provenance of the painting, and how it came to St. James cathedral, is unknown, although it once hung in the cathedral&#x27;s baptistery (now the Reconciliation Chapel) until it was moved to the cathedral chapel in 1950.

<text>The Spartakiad (or Spartakiade) was an international sports event that was sponsored by the Soviet Union. Five international Spartakiades were held from 1928 to 1937. Later Spartakiads were organized as national sport events of the Eastern Bloc countries. The games were organised by Red Sport International.

==Background==

The Soviet Union attempted to use Spartakiads to both oppose and supplement the Olympics. In Russian, there is a certain parallelism in the names: &quot;Spartakiada&quot; and &quot;Olimpiada&quot;. The name, derived from the name of the slave rebel leader, Spartacus, was intended to symbolize proletarian internationalism. As a classical figure, Spartacus also stood directly in contrast to the aristocratic nature of the Ancient Olympic Games on which the modern &quot;capitalist&quot; Olympics were based. The first Winter Spartakiad was held in February 1928 in Oslo, and the first Summer Spartakiad was held in August 1928 in Moscow.

The first Spartakiads in the USSR took place in 1923 within formations of the Red Army and the Spartak Physical Culture organization in Petrograd. The Moscow Spartakiad in 1928 was also known as the All-Union Spartakiad. From the start of the 1930s in the Soviet Union, spartakiads of trade unions and the Dynamo physical culture sports society took place. In the 1950s, spartakiads of the Peoples of the USSR, DOSAAF of the USSR, all-Union Spartakiads of students, international Spartakiads of &quot;friendly armies of socialist and developing countries&quot;, and others were introduced.

==List of Spartakiads==
;Summer
* 1928 – Moscow
* 1931 – Berlin

;Winter
* 1928 – Oslo
* 1936 – Oslo

==After World War II==
===Soviet Union===

In 1952, the Soviet Union decided to join the Olympic movement, and international Spartakiads ceased, but the term continued to exist for internal sports events in the Soviet Union of different levels, from local up to the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR (). The latter event was held twice in four years: Winter Spartakiad and Summer Spartakiad.

The first Soviet Spartakiad was held in 1956. According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, the number of participants in the 6th Summer Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR was 90 million people (twice the number of athletes in the USSR in that time), including 8,300 Masters of Sports of the USSR, and 20 million in the 3rd Winter Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR, including some 1,000 Masters of Sports of the USSR. These numbers however have been frequently called into question due to the low reliability and ideological bias of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. The Winter and Summer Spartakiads of the Peoples of the USSR were each commemorated on a series of postage stamps, released in millions of copies. Until 1975, all summer finals were held in Moscow, later in other cities throughout the Soviet Union (though most events were still held in Moscow). The winter editions&#x27; finals were often held in Sverdlovsk.

===Czechoslovakia===

The name Spartakiáda was also used for a mass gymnastics display, which was held every five years at the Strahov Stadium in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The first event of this name was held, however, already in 1921, and its initiator Jiří František Chaloupecký is credited as the inventor of the name.

===Albania===

Six similar events were held in Albania during communist rule as well (in 1959, 1969, 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1989).

===Other===
In 1984, the Soviet Union organised the Friendship Games, aimed at countries which boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics.

On July 17, 2006, Ryan King launched &quot;s5project.org&quot;, &quot;a new community site, dedicated to the S5 Presentation software&quot;.

On December 4, 2006, Andreas Gohr announced a DokuWiki plugin that converts Wiki markup to XHTML-compatible S5 presentations.
==Structure==
The content of an S5 presentation can be stored in a single XHTML file. This file contains several slides which are structured in the following way:
&lt;div class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;slide title&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the first point&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the second point&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the third point&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;handout&quot;&gt;
 ... additional material that appears
 on the handout
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
S5 presentations can be viewed in outline and slideshow mode; Cascading Style Sheets are used to define different layouts for outline, slideshow and print. Navigation controls, a dynamically generated list of slides and accesskeys allow browsing back and forth.

A more semantic version of the S5 format is based on the XOXO microformat and uses codice_1 instead of divs for the slides, as well as codice_2 instead of a div for the overall presentation.

<doc id="1082235" wikidata="Q926665" url="?curid=1082235" title="Alejandro Moreno">
<text>Alejandro Enrique Moreno Riera (born July 8, 1979) is a Venezuelan former professional footballer who played as a forward, and who is a television commentator for ESPN FC, ESPN Deportes and ESPN Latin America. Moreno won three MLS Cups during his professional career. Moreno was chosen in 2021 to work as a commentator in the 2020 European Championship.

==Club career==

===College===
Moreno spent a year in Texas at age 12 and spent succeeding summers there before earning a scholarship for four years of college soccer at UNC Greensboro. He finished his college career fourth on the team&#x27;s all-time scoring lists, with 65 goals and 25 assists, having been named first team NSCAA All-South all four years with the team.

===Professional===
After completing his career at Greensboro, Moreno was drafted 27th overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by the Los Angeles Galaxy. He played sparingly in his rookie season, but developed into an excellent sparkplug coming off the bench in his second season, when he registered six goals and two assists in 1,117 minutes of playing time.

Although Moreno exhibited a good deal of promise in 2003, he was not able to earn a consistent starting role with the Galaxy because of a logjam at the forward position, which included Guatemalan star Carlos Ruiz and former US international Jovan Kirovski, as well as recent acquisition Joseph Ngwenya. In 2004, Moreno again registered six goals and two assists, this time in 1,297 minutes. He was traded to San Jose Earthquakes in the offseason in a four-player deal. In his lone season with the Quakes, Moreno scored eight goals with four assists. Along with the rest of his Earthquakes teammates, he moved to Houston for the 2006 season.

Moreno was traded to Columbus Crew on May 10, 2007, in exchange for Joseph Ngwenya. He scored the first goal in the 2008 MLS Cup for Columbus, who eventually won the game 3-1 against New York Red Bulls.

Moreno was selected by Philadelphia Union in the 2009 MLS Expansion Draft on 25 November 2009.

On November 24, 2010, Moreno was selected by Vancouver Whitecaps FC in the 2010 MLS Expansion Draft, but was immediately traded to Chivas USA, along with Alan Gordon, in exchange for allocation money and an international roster spot.

Moreno remained with Chivas USA through the 2012 season. After the conclusion of the 2012 season, Chivas USA declined the 2013 option on Moreno&#x27;s contract and he entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Moreno became a free agent after he went undrafted in both rounds of the draft. In February 2013, he joined the Philadelphia Union as a television commentator, ending his playing career.

==International career==
Moreno&#x27;s performances in MLS saw him receive call-ups for the Venezuela national team. He made his first appearance for the senior team on February 18, 2004, against Australia. Due to his high quality of form during the 2008 MLS season, Moreno was again called up to the Venezuela national team for some 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches, scoring against Ecuador on October 15, 2008, in a 3–1 win.

==Media career==
In 2013, ESPN FC hired Moreno as a color commentator and analyst. He frequently covers Liga MX and Mexico national football team games on ESPN&#x27;s English-language networks. In 2014, he served as color commentator for the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer.

<doc id="1082238" wikidata="Q5946834" url="?curid=1082238" title="Huron-Wendat Nation">
<text>The Huron-Wendat Nation (or Huron-Wendat First Nation) is an Iroquoian-speaking nation that was established in the 17th century. In the French language, used by most members of the First Nation, they are known as the . The French gave the nickname to the Wendat, from the French word meaning &#x27;boar&#x27;s head&#x27; because of the hairstyle of Huron men, who had their hair standing in bristles on their heads. Wendat (Quendat) was their confederacy name, meaning &#x27;people of the island&#x27; or &#x27;dwellers on a peninsula&#x27;.

The nation inhabited the area between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay, historically known as Wendake (Huronia), conquered and devastated in the 17th century Beaver Wars, which prompted the surviving Hurons to move east to Quebec, under French protection. It now has two communities and reserves, &quot;Wendake 7&quot; and &quot;Wendake 7A&quot;, at Wendake, Quebec, a municipality now enclosed within Quebec City in Canada.

The 1760 Huron–British North American Peace Treaty, lost in 1824 but rediscovered in the 1990s, showed that a large chunk of land named (now part of Quebec City) was sold to the Hurons in 1760 by the Jesuits. Therefore, the Huron-Wendats have a contemporary claim to this valuable land.

Today, Wendake tourism is the main economic drive, which includes a developed historic sector, a residential district and an industrial zone. As of April 2022, registered members of the Huron-Wendat Nation in Wendake, Quebec consists of 4,578 members.

== History ==
In the late 16th century, Wendat Confederacy was formed to defend against their common enemy, which was the Iroquois Confederacy. Wendat Confederacy consisted of four allied nations, including Attinniaoenten (Bear), Atingeennonniahak (Cords), Arendaenronnon (Rock), Atahontaenrat (Deer) and Ataronchronon (Bog). However, the last group Ataronchronon (Bog) may have been a division of the Attinniaoenten (Bear) since they may have not attained full membership. Due to diseases introduced by the Europeans and a lack of firearms, in 1648 to 1650, the Wendat Confederacy was defeated by the Iroquois Confederacy. After that, Huron refugees joined with the neighboring Tionontati tribe to form Wyandot, which was a corrupted form of Wendat Confederacy.

August 27, 1999, Wendat Confederacy was reaffirmed by signing a document with their mothers blood: The Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma (United States), Wyandot Nation of Kansas (United States), the Wyandot of Anderdon Nation (Michigan, United States) and the Huron Wendat of Wendake (Quebec, Canada).

== Demographics ==
Before the 16th century, the Huron-Wendat&#x27;s population was approximately 20,000 to 25,000 people. However, when diseases were brought by the Europeans around 1634 to 1642, particularly measles, influenza and smallpox, their population reduced significantly to about 9,000 people. Today, as of April 2022, the number of registered members of the Huron-Wendat Nation in Wendake, Quebec consists of 4,578 members.

In the United States, there are around 5,900 people that are identified as Wyandot or Wyandotte, currently enrolling as members of the federally recognized Wyandotte Nation that has a headquarter in Wyandotte, Oklahoma.

=== Language ===

Wendat or Huron was the spoken language of the Huron-Wendat Nation in Quebec, Canada and some parts of Oklahoma in the United States, and it was traditionally spoken by Wyandot, Wyandotte or Huron people. The language was closely related to the Iroquois language.

Wyandot (or sometimes known as Wandat) is considered as a sister language to the Wendat language that was previously used in the Huron-Wendat Confederacy. Some linguists saw this as a dialect or a modern form of the Wendat language. It was reported that the language is mostly used in Oklahoma, United States.

Around the second half of the 19th century, Wendat died out because there was no living speakers. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were being made to revive the dormant language by using historical dictionaries and manuscripts from Recollet and Jesuit missionaries. In 2010, the Wendat Community of Quebec and the Wyandot Nation of Oklahoma have been teaching Wendat and Wyandot (the dialect of Wendat) to their community members, respectively.

=== Government ===
Village, tribe and confederacy made up the basic level of government system in the Huron-Wendat Nation. At the village level, there were several chiefs to represent different clans, and each chief had different status (e.g.: civil or war chief). Most of their status were inherited, but they could fight for that or being appointed by older women of the lineage. The chief organized a council meeting to discuss about current issues within the village, and men and women were welcomed to give opinions. The meeting for the Huron-Wendat Confederacy happened once a year.

Jesuit Father Lallemant, noted of the Wendat in 1644: 

==== Social organization ====
The Wendats were a matrilineal society in which status and property were inherited through the women&#x27;s line. Property, clan membership and position could potentially be passed down.

==== Clan system ====
Similar to other Iroquois nations, Wendat society used a matrilineal clan system which has clans named after certain animals. There are eight matrilineal clans: Turtle, Wolf, Bear, Beaver, Deer, Hawk, Porcupine, and Snake. In order to unify, each person in each clan, no matter their nation or village, was seen as related. Thus, people would have to marry a person outside of their clan.

== Economy ==
About 70% of the area north and west of Lake Simcoe and south and east of Georgian Bay, where the Huron-Wendat nation occupied, was agricultural land. Because of this, most Huron-Wendat were farmers, and their economy was based on horticulture by growing maize, beans and squash.
The Huron (Wyandotte) lived in Ontario near the northern limit of where agriculture was feasible and had less fertile soils than many other regions to the south and west. Nevertheless, with polyculture (practiced predominantly with the Three Sisters), they produced surpluses for trading with nearby non-agricultural peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hart/Feranec&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Iroquois and other Native Americans did not plow their land, a team of scholars (Mt. Pleasant and Burt) concluded that their lands retained more organic matter and thus were higher in yields of maize than early Euro-American farms in North America. 

== Culture ==

=== Housing ===
Similar to other Iroquoian-speaking people, the Huron built in longhouses that had a rectangular shape with rounded roofs that were covered by bark panels. These houses were built to serve as homes for extended families.
=== Clothing ===
Wendat clothing was mostly made from deer and beaver hides. Their clothes were very decorative by using porcupine quills, feathers, and wampum, and red was the most favourite colour in their culture.

Men wore loincloths and moccasins on their feet, and in the winter, they wore sleeves and a cloak made of fur. On their backs, they wore fire pouches so that they could carry tobacco pipes, charms and personal belongings. Wendat men tended to smoke, so it was common for them to carry a pipe. Women wore the same thing as men, but instead of loincloths, they wore skirts.

=== Media ===

==== Book ====
The book, &quot;Revisiting 1759&quot;, was written by author Thomas Peace and published by the University of Toronto Press in 2012. In chapter 6, Peace talks about how Huron-Wendat Nation responded to changes that happened during the conquest of Quebec from 1697 to 1791.

<text>The Waihemo / Shag River is located in Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. It rises in the Kakanui Range, flowing southeast for , or before reaching the Pacific Ocean on the south side of Shag Point / Matakaea, east of Palmerston. The Dunback Branch railway that operated from the 1880s to 1989 largely followed the route of the river from its junction with the Main South Line near Shag Point township to its terminus in Dunback.

The small- to medium-sized river has been adversely affected over the past decades by farming practices in the area. Much of its length is overgrown with willows, and during the summer its flow can become significantly reduced.

In 1985, the name of the river was gazetted by Land Information New Zealand as Shag River (Waihemo). In August 2021, the name was officially amended to Waihemo / Shag River.

Waihemo means a &#x27;river that has gone away&#x27; or &#x27;dwindled&#x27;. Early whalers named the river after the common seabird.

<text>The Manuherikia River is located in Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. It rises in the far north of the Maniototo, with the West Branch draining the eastern side of the St Bathans Range, and the East Branch draining the western flanks of the Hawkdun Range. The river continues southwest through the wide Manuherikia Valley to its confluence with the Clutha River at Alexandra. During the 1860s the Manuherikia was one of the centres of the Otago gold rush.

The river is crossed by two historically significant bridges, the curved Manuherikia Bridge No.1 (number 70 on the Otago Central Railway line), a concrete pier bridge completed in 1903, and a stone pier bridge at Ophir built in 1880.

The Māori spelling for the river is Manuherekia, meaning &quot;at long last&quot;.

<text>The Tuapeka River is a river located in Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. It is a tributary of the Clutha River, which it joins at Tuapeka Mouth between Roxburgh and Balclutha.

The Tuapeka&#x27;s main claim to fame is as the centre of the Otago gold rush of the 1860s. The first major discovery of gold in Otago was at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully, close to the Tuapeka, in 1861.

An earlier wooden crib dam was built further upstream in 1907. The concrete dam was begun in 1914. Water from the dam was conveyed on a water race to the turbine and sluicing area.

<text>The Cardrona River is in Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. It is one of the first tributaries of the Clutha River / Mata-Au, which it meets only from the latter&#x27;s origin at the outflow of Lake Wānaka.

The Cardrona flows north for down the steep narrow Cardrona Valley. Its headwaters are near New Zealand&#x27;s highest main road, the Crown Range route. The river runs past the settlement of Cardona and the Cardrona skifield, then south of Wānaka township.

The original name of the river is the . It was a traditional Māori route linking Whakatipu Waimāori (Lake Wakatipu) with lakes Wānaka and Hāwea. Ngāi Tahu recorded Ōrau as a kāinga mahinga kai (food-gathering place) where tuna (eels), pora (&#x27;Māori turnip&#x27;) and weka were gathered.

<text>The Bishop of Leeds is the Ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds in the Province of Liverpool, England.

The Vicariate Apostolic of the Yorkshire District was elevated to diocese status as the Diocese of Beverley on 29 September 1850, which was suppressed on 20 December 1878 and its area was divided into the dioceses of Leeds and Middlesbrough.

The Diocese of Leeds covers an area of and consists of the County of West Yorkshire, together parts of the counties of the East Riding of Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and Cumbria. The see is in the city of Leeds where the bishop&#x27;s seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Anne, Cookridge Street.

On 15 September 2014, Pope Francis appointed Monsignor Marcus Stock, at the time, the General Secretary of the Bishops&#x27; Conference, as the 10th Bishop of Leeds. He was consecrated as Bishop on 13 November 2014.

<doc id="1082294" wikidata="Q2055750" url="?curid=1082294" title="Compound Poisson process">
<text>A compound Poisson process is a continuous-time stochastic process with jumps. The jumps arrive randomly according to a Poisson process and the size of the jumps is also random, with a specified probability distribution. To be precise, a compound Poisson process, parameterised by a rate formula_1 and jump size distribution &quot;G&quot;, is a process formula_2 given by

:formula_3

where, formula_4 is the counting variable of a Poisson process with rate formula_5, and formula_6 are independent and identically distributed random variables, with distribution function &quot;G&quot;, which are also independent of formula_7

When formula_8 are non-negative integer-valued random variables, then this compound Poisson process is known as a stuttering Poisson process. 

==Properties of the compound Poisson process==
The expected value of a compound Poisson process can be calculated using a result known as Wald&#x27;s equation as:

:formula_9

Making similar use of the law of total variance, the variance can be calculated as: 
:formula_10

Lastly, using the law of total probability, the moment generating function can be given as follows:
:formula_11

:formula_12

==Exponentiation of measures==
Let &quot;N&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; be as above. Let &quot;μ&quot; be the probability measure according to which &quot;D&quot; is distributed, i.e.

:formula_13

Let &quot;δ&quot;0 be the trivial probability distribution putting all of the mass at zero. Then the probability distribution of &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the measure

:formula_14

where the exponential exp(&quot;ν&quot;) of a finite measure &quot;ν&quot; on Borel subsets of the real line is defined by

:formula_15

and

:formula_16

is a convolution of measures, and the series converges weakly.

<text>Bradley Joseph Davis (born November 8, 1981) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a midfielder.

==Career==

===Youth and College===
Davis attended high school at Chaminade College Preparatory School in Missouri. When he was 16, he had the chance to move to The Netherlands and join the PSV Eindhoven academy, but Davis opted to stay at home. He joined Saint Louis University (SLU) in 2000, where he played for two seasons before leaving college soccer for the professional ranks. While at SLU, Davis was named the Conference USA Freshman of the Year his first year, and a second team NSCAA All-American as a sophomore.

===Professional===

Davis was selected third overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by the MetroStars. On April 6, he scored his first career MLS goal, scoring the winner to give the MetroStars a 2–1 win over the Columbus Crew. He scored four goals in 24 appearances in his debut season, and was a finalist for the MLS Rookie of the Year Award. He was then traded to the Dallas Burn for the fourth overall pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft.

In his second year with the team, new coach Colin Clarke tried to move Davis to the center of the field to play attacking midfielder. After making little impact through several games, however, Davis returned to the left. There he had to compete with newcomer Eric Quill for playing time. Davis finished the season with only two goals and two assists despite playing more minutes than in 2003, as the Burn yet again missed the playoffs. 

On MLS draft day 2005 Davis was traded to the San Jose Earthquakes with cash and the #4 draft pick in exchange for Richard Mulrooney, Arturo Alvarez and the #6 draft pick. That season he made 18 MLS appearances for San Jose, scoring two goals. Davis did not appear for them in the MLS play-offs due to a groin strain. After the 2005 season, the club moved to Houston and was rechristened the Houston Dynamo.

For the 2006 season, Davis had a team high 11 assists as the Dynamo finished second in the Western Conference and qualified for the playoffs. In the second leg of the semi-finals against Chivas USA, Davis scored on a penalty kick to tie the aggregate score. The Dynamo won the tie 3–2 on aggregate. He helped the team reach the final by getting two assists in a 3–1 win over the Colorado Rapids in the conference finals. In the final, the Dynamo defeated the New England Revolution on penalties.

In 2007, Davis missed extensive time due to a torn right meniscus he suffered in practice. He returned from injury in time for the playoffs. The Dynamo matched up with Davis&#x27;s former team FC Dallas (known as the Dallas Burn while Davis played there) in the first round. He scored on a free kick in the 100th minute of the second leg to give the Dynamo a 4–2 win on aggregate. In the final against the Revolution, Davis assisted on the winning goal by Dwayne De Rosario in the 74th minute, giving the Dynamo a 2–1 win.

In 2008, Davis and the Dynamo finished first in the west, but were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the New York Red Bulls. The Dynamo had success in the North American SuperLiga that year, however the Revolution got revenge by beating Davis and the Dynamo on penalties.

In 2009, Davis had a strong season individually, being named an MLS all star and scoring 5 and assisting on 12 in MLS play, and the team finished 2nd in the west. However the Dynamo lost in the Conference Finals to the Los Angeles Galaxy. For 2010, Davis would match the previous season&#x27;s stats and once again make the all star team, but this time the Dynamo would miss the playoffs.

2011 saw Davis lead MLS in assists with 16, make the all star team and finish as a finalist for the league MVP Award. However, despite helping the Dynamo advance to their third-ever MLS Cup, Davis missed the final after suffering a torn quadriceps in an Eastern Conference Final win over Sporting Kansas City. Houston would lose to the Galaxy 1–0.

During the 2012 season, he scored a personal best of 8 goals, made the 2012 all star team, and lead the Houston Dynamo to the MLS Cup final. Despite taking an early lead, the Dynamo would fall once again to the Galaxy, this time by a score of 3–1.

In 2013, he recorded 4 goals and 9 assists, made his 5th straight all star team, and again helped Houston qualify for the playoffs. However this time they would fall to Kansas City in the conference finals. Davis scored the game-winning goal in the 1st leg of the CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinals vs Santos Laguna, but they fell 3–1 on aggregate.

Ahead of the 2016 season, Davis was traded to Sporting Kansas City for picks in the 2017 and 2018 MLS SuperDrafts as well as future considerations. He retired following the 2016 season.

In February 2017, Davis and the Houston Dynamo agreed to a one-day contract, allowing him to officially retire as a member of the Houston Dynamo organization.

===International===
Davis has played for several youth United States national teams. He played for the U.S. at the 2001 World Youth Championship in Argentina for the Under-23 team. Davis received his first cap for the senior team July 7, 2005 in a Gold Cup match against Cuba. He also converted the clinching penalty kick in the United States&#x27; shootout victory over Panama in the Gold Cup final. Davis has also recorded four assists with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team, including the assist on Graham Zusi&#x27;s goal on October 15, 2013, against Panama that eliminated Panama from the 2014 FIFA World Cup and saw Mexico qualify. Davis was included on Jürgen Klinsmann&#x27;s 30-man preliminary roster for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Davis subsequently made the final 23 that will go to the World Cup. In the USMNT&#x27;s first send-off game against Azerbaijan, Davis came off the bench and assisted Aron Johannsson on the United States&#x27; second goal of the night to make the score 2–0, which was also the final score.

<text>The [[Bishop]] of [[Plymouth]] is the Ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth in the Province of Southwark, England.

The diocese covers an area of and consists of the counties of Cornwall, Devon and Dorset. The see is in the City of Plymouth where the bishop&#x27;s seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Mary and Saint Boniface.

The diocese of Plymouth was one of the dioceses erected on 29 September 1850 from the Vicariate Apostolic of the Western District. The Right Reverend Mark O&#x27;Toole, the 9th Bishop of Plymouth, was appointed on 9 November 2013 by Pope Francis. In June 2022 he was translated to both the Archbishopric of Cardiff and the Bishopric of Menevia; since then the see has been vacant. 

In December 2023, Pope Francis appointed Canon Christopher Whitehead of the Diocese of Clifton to become the 10th Bishop of Plymouth. Bishop-Elect Christopher was to be installed on 22 February 2024. On 1 February, the Bishops of England and Wales announced that his ordination was cancelled, pending a canonical process investigating Canon Whitehead, who stepped down from active ministry during the investigation. Whitehead was subsequently cleared of all charges, and returned to ministry in Clifton. In September 2024, Pope Francis appointed Bishop Philip Moger, auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Southwark, to become the 10th Bishop of Plymouth, to be installed on 9 November 2024. On November 6, however, Moger issued an apology stating he intended to postpone his installation until termination of the investigation of personal issued raised. Finally, on 24 February, 2025, Bishop Moger announced via the Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales that the pope had accepted his resignation from the appointment to the see of Plymouth, as the resolution of ‘concerns of a personal nature’ had ‘taken longer than anticipated’.

<text>The Bishop of Portsmouth () is the Ordinary of the Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth in the Province of Southwark, England.

The bishop&#x27;s official residence is Bishop&#x27;s House, Bishop Crispian Way, Portsmouth, Hampshire.

The current bishop is Philip Egan, who was ordained bishop at St John&#x27;s Cathedral, Portsmouth, on 24 September 2012, the Feast of Our Lady of Walsingham. Bishop Egan was previously the Vicar General for the Diocese of Shrewsbury and his appointment was announced by the Holy See on 11 July 2012. The bishop emeritus is the Right Reverend Crispian Hollis, the 7th bishop of Portsmouth, who was appointed on 6 December 1988. He reached retirement age (75) in November 2011, and retired as Bishop on 11 July 2012 upon his successor&#x27;s appointment. Bishop Hollis acted as Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Portsmouth from 11 July 2012 until Bishop Egan&#x27;s ordination on 24 September 2012.

==History==
In 1688 the Portsmouth area came under the authority of the Vicar Apostolic of the London District. On the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales in 1850 Portsmouth became part of the Diocese of Southwark. On 19 May 1882 the Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth was created, and consists of the counties of Hampshire and Dorset, together with Berkshire and Oxfordshire south of the River Thames, plus the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands.

In October 2022 it was announced that the diocese was to reduce from 87 parishes to 24 parishes through a programme of church closures and amalgamations; a move prompted in part by falling attendances and a reduction of over 60% in the number of priests.

<text>Geoffrey Bernard Braybrooke (4 April 1935 – 9 March 2013) was a New Zealand politician. He was a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1981 to 2002, representing the Labour Party. He was notably one of the party&#x27;s more socially conservative MPs.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Braybrooke was born in Gillingham, Kent, England, on 4 April 1935, the son of Geoff and Edith Braybrooke, and was educated at Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate. It was the same school that future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Edward Heath had attended. He attended Chatham House after he won a state scholarship and there was exposed to snobbery and exclusion by fellow students as he came from a working class family.

He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1952 and served in the Korean War. In 1955, he became a police officer in London, but in 1957, he chose to move to New Zealand and re-enter the army. Braybrooke reminisced about emigrating: &quot;I became a New Zealand citizen in 1958 and I never regretted it. I am a Kiwi by choice, not by an accident of birth. It started when I was in the Metropolitan Police and I was standing at Charing Cross in the pouring rain directing traffic. I was nearly run over a bus and later I had three pub fights to sort out. I walked past New Zealand House, which was in the Strand then, and it looked so good that I went in and made enquiries. I had to join the Army again to be accepted.&quot;

He served in the Royal New Zealand Army Medical Corps from 1957 until 1970. During his military career, he served in the Malayan Emergency and Vietnam War as a Warrant Officer. Despite serving there, he was firmly of the opinion that New Zealand should never have gotten itself involved in the Vietnam War stating &quot;I saw all the horror and filth of war and read all the rubbish that was written about it back here and it was all to support corrupt officials. We weren&#x27;t supporting democracy, we were protecting people who flew out of Vietnam with bags of gold. It was a fascist regime and a communist regime having a go at each other. But, for all that, I am not a pacifist. I believe in a strong, well-trained and well-equipped army for New Zealand&#x27;s defence. But it should be for self-defence only. I do not believe in fighting other people&#x27;s wars for them. I know it is hard to spend money on an army when people are going without, but New Zealand cannot afford to become defenceless.&quot; He blamed his ill-health in later life on the effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam.

In 1959, Braybrooke married Janice Cater, and the couple went on to have two children. He represented the New Zealand Army in both soccer and basketball and was later an official with the New Zealand Amateur Athletics Association. After leaving the army, he became a sales manager for a pharmaceutical research company until 1980.

===Member of Parliament===



Braybrooke had joined the British Labour Party when only fourteen years old, and when he moved to New Zealand, he became a supporter of the New Zealand Labour Party. In the 1969 elections, he managed Mick Connelly&#x27;s campaign in the Wigram seat. He then unsuccessfully contested the seats of Franklin, Pakuranga, and Papakura in the 1972 elections, 1975 elections, and the 1978 elections, respectively. He also made an abortive attempt to become Labour&#x27;s candidate for the 1977 Mangere by-election. In the 1981 elections, he was finally elected MP for Napier.

Upon entering Parliament he stated his support for the armed forces, opposition to abortion and his desire for the Labour Party to return to what it stood for under previous leader Norman Kirk (whom he admired greatly). In 1983 he was appointed as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for War Pensions and Rehabilitation by Labour leader David Lange.

During the controversial Fourth Labour Government Braybrooke was chairman of the communications and road safety select committee. After the defeat of the government in 1990 he was appointed Shadow Minister of Transport and Disabilities by leader Mike Moore. He supported Moore when he was successfully challenged by Helen Clark after Labour narrowly lost the 1993 election. Subsequently he was appointed Shadow Minister of Defence and Veterans Affairs by Clark.

Braybrooke was one of the more socially conservative members of the Labour Party and was at times he was offside with liberal-minded colleagues. According to Braybrooke his affiliation with Labour was attributed to his working class background stating in 1982 &quot;My background was as poor as a church mouse&#x27;s. I know what it is like to labour away and be broke at the end of the week and have to go without.&quot; In 1985, when his fellow Labour MP Fran Wilde attempted to overturn legal prohibitions against homosexuality, Braybrooke was active in campaigning against the change, and later opposed measures promoted by National&#x27;s Katherine O&#x27;Regan to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. In 2011, near the end of his life, he said that his views had changed and he had come to accept the gay community. He opposed Helen Clark&#x27;s rise to the Labour Party&#x27;s leadership, remaining strongly loyal to her predecessor, Mike Moore. This led him to be involved in the failed discussions during 1995 &amp; 1996 about forming a new breakaway party led by Moore. When he retired from politics, however, he praised Clark in his valedictory speech as &quot;one of the great Labour leaders,&quot; and said with regard to his vote for Moore over her that &quot;It just shows that we can all make mistakes and we can all learn. I mean that sincerely.&quot;

Throughout his career in Parliament, Braybrooke never had ambition to hold any ministerial roles, but did serve as Deputy Speaker and Labour defence spokesperson. Soon after entering parliament he stated his ideal role would have been a Labour government&#x27;s Senior Whip stating &quot;I think I would be well suited to being a senior whip. There are similarities between a whip and a sergeant major.&quot; He held the Napier seat until his retirement at the 2002 elections.

===Later life and death===
He died in Palmerston North in 2013.

==Honours and recognition==
He was an appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1970. In 1990, Braybrooke was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. Following his retirement from Parliament, he was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services, in the 2003 New Year Honours.

<doc id="1082316" wikidata="Q969675" url="?curid=1082316" title="Joseph Solomon Delmedigo">
<text>Joseph Solomon Delmedigo (or Del Medigo), also known as Yashar Mi-Qandia (; 16 June 1591 – 16 October 1655), was a rabbi, author, physician, mathematician, and music theorist.

Born in Candia, Crete, a descendant of Elia del Medigo, Joseph Solomon or Yashar Mi-Qandia is a member of Del Medigo de&#x27;Candia lineage from the Geiger family of Germany that settled first in Crete and then in Italy. Eventually, he moved to Padua, Italy, studying medicine and taking classes with Galileo Galilei in astronomy. After graduating in 1613 he moved to Venice and spent a year in the company of Leon de Modena and Simone Luzzatto. From Venice he went back to Candia and from there started traveling in the near East, reaching Alexandria and Cairo. There he went into a public contest in mathematics against a local mathematician. From Egypt he moved to Istanbul, there he observed the comet of 1619. After Istanbul he wandered along the Karaite communities in Eastern Europe, finally arriving at Amsterdam in 1623. He died in Prague, just before turning 65 after a celebration of lights at the Staronová synagoga. Yet in his lifetime wherever he sojourned he earned his living as a physician and or teacher. His only known works are &quot;Elim&quot; (Palms), dealing with mathematics, astronomy, the natural sciences, and metaphysics, as well as some letters and essays.

As Delmedigo writes in his book, he followed the lectures by Galileo Galilei, during the academic year 1609–1610, and was accorded the rare privilege of using Galileo&#x27;s own telescope. In the following years he often refers to Galilei as &quot;rabbi Galileo,&quot; an ambiguous phrase which may simply mean &quot;my master, Galileo.&quot; (Delmedigo never calls him &quot;our teacher and master, Rabbi Galileo,&quot; which would be the typical way of referring to an actual rabbi.) Elijah Montalto, physician of Maria de Medici, is also mentioned as one of his teachers.

==Works==

&quot;Elim&quot; (1629, published by Menasseh ben Israel, Amsterdam) is written in Hebrew, in response to 12 general and 70 specific religious and scientific questions sent to Delmedigo by a Karaite Jew, Zerach ben Natan from Troki (Lithuania). The format of the book is taken from the number of fountains and palm trees at Elim in the Sinai Peninsula, as given in Numbers, xxxiii, 9: since there are 12 fountains and 70 palm trees at Elim, Delmedigo divided his book into twelve major problems and seventy minor problems. The book, however, was heavily censored, so only four of the original twelve major problems appeared in the published work. The subjects discussed include astronomy, physics, mathematics, medicine, and music theory. In the area of music, Delmedigo discusses the physics of music including string resonance, intervals and their proportions, consonance and dissonance. Delmedigo argued that the Jews did not take part in the Scientific Revolution because of Ashkenazi exclusive intellectual interest in the Talmud, whereas the Sepharadim and the Karaites were more interested in natural philosophy and philosophy in general. He called the Jews to reclaim their prominence in philosophy and to incorporate into the non-Jewish surrounding via the exploration of natural sciences.

Some parts of the book were as follows:
*&quot;Ma&#x27;ayan Chatum&quot; (Closed or Sealed Fountain - Heb. מעין חתום) is the second part of Sefer Elim, containing the 70 questions and answers.
*&quot;Ma&#x27;ayan Ganim&quot; (Fountain of the Gardens - Heb. מעין גנים) is a continuation of Sefer Elim, consisting of the following short treatises: on trigonometry, on the first two books of the Almagest, on astronomy, on astronomical instruments, on Kabbalah (mainly the Ari) and the supernatural, on astrology, on algebra, on chemistry, on the aphorisms of Hippocrates, on the opinion of the ancients concerning the substance of the heavens, on the astronomy of the ancients, who considered the motion of the higher spheres due to spirits (Delmedigo shows that their motion is similar to that of the earth), on the principles of religion, and mathematical paradoxes.
*&quot;Chukkot Shamayim&quot; is a part of Mayan Ganim dealing with the first two books of the Almagest.
*&quot;Gevurot Hashem&quot; is a treatise on astronomy.

He also wrote a defense of the Kabbalah called &quot;Matzreif LaChachma&quot; (Heb. מצרף לחכמה) against the attack upon it by his great grandfather Eliyahu Delmedigo. In the preface of the book the publisher writes that the author himself admitted once that when he was young (18 years old when he went to study in the university of Padua) he used to mock the Kabbalah and fiercely opposed those who studied it, but when he turned twenty seven he had a change of heart when he met two great philosophers, R&#x27; Yaakov ibn Nachmias and R&#x27; Shlomo Aravi, who were also firm adherents of the Kabbalah and they showed him how closely it resembles the philosophy of Plato, since then there was a renewed spirit within him.

==Descendants==

Some of Delmedigo&#x27;s descendants from the Geiger family of Germany settled in Central Italy by the surname Del-Medigo da&#x27;Candia, others were recorded in Belorussia taken on the surname Gorodinsky (after the town of Gorodin). A member of this family, Mordechai Gorodinsky (later hebraized to Nachmani) was one of the founders of the Israeli city of Rehovot reported by the Yad Vashem.

<text>The Bishop of Salford is the ordinary of the Catholic Diocese of Salford in the Province of Liverpool, England.

With the gradual abolition of the legal restrictions on the activities of Catholics in England and Wales in the early 19th century, Rome decided to proceed to bridge the gap of the centuries from Queen Elizabeth I by instituting Catholic dioceses on the regular historical pattern. On 29 September 1850, Pope Pius IX issued the Bull &quot;Universalis Ecclesiae&quot; which created thirteen new dioceses which did not formally claim any continuity with the pre-Elizabethan English dioceses of which one of these was the diocese of Salford and went on to take up the reins of part of the former Vicariate Apostolic of the Lancashire District.

In the early period from 1850 the diocese was a suffragan of the Metropolitan See of Westminster, but a further development was its assignment under Pope Pius X, on 28 October 1911, to a newly created province of Liverpool.

At the diocese&#x27;s creation the territory assigned to it was the hundreds of Salford and Blackburn. The diocese currently covers an area of and consists of a large part of Greater Manchester and adjacent parts of Lancashire.

The see is in the Salford area of Greater Manchester, where the Bishop&#x27;s &quot;cathedra&quot; or seat is located in the Salford Cathedral, which was dedicated on 14 June 1890.

The Bishop&#x27;s residence is Wardley Hall, Worsley, Greater Manchester.

The current bishop is John Arnold, formerly an Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Westminster. He was appointed by Pope Francis to succeed Terence Brain as the 11th Bishop of Salford on 30 September 2014 and was installed on 8 December 2014.

== List of bishops ==

<text>Craig Capano (born July 7, 1985) is an American soccer player, who last played for the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer.

Capano was selected 17th overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by the Fire, (the youngest player ever drafted by the Fire at the age of sixteen) having elected to forgo college to focus on his professional career. Before joining the Fire, Capano had spent two years at the USSF&#x27;s Bradenton Academy training with the U-17 U.S. national team.

Capano saw little playing time with the Fire, playing 92 minutes over four games in his first season and 122 minutes over 5 games in his second. In 2004, his third season, he appeared to have reached a turning point, earning 440 minutes, scoring his first MLS goal, and being widely rated as one of the team&#x27;s better players when he was finally given consistent playing time toward the end of the year. However, he saw no time in 2005 after undergoing surgery on March 7, 2005, to repair a tear in his left anterior cruciate ligament, or in 2006. He was waived at the end of the latter season.

Despite playing little in MLS, Capano was a vital player for the U-20 US national team, along with other notables such as Eddie Gaven, Freddy Adu, Danny Szetela, and Jonathan Spector. He played in all four games of the 2004 Northern Ireland Milk Cup and served as the U-20 Men&#x27;s National Team captain that July, helping the squad to finish 6th, also scoring the game&#x27;s lone goal on April 21 for a 1–0 win over Haiti&#x27;s U-20.

As of March, 2007, Capano was known to be training in camp with New York Red Bulls. Throughout his career, Capano - widely seen as a skillful player - has battled the perception that he was too small and slight to forge a successful career in MLS.

<text>Clash of Arms Games is a wargaming company best known for a high level of graphics quality and moderately to highly complex games, often focusing on the Napoleonic era, but with offerings in most eras of military history.

 and &quot;The Dawn of the Rising Sun&quot; (one of the 2004 Origins Award winners, for Best Historical Miniatures Rules).

The company&#x27;s latest release is the highly anticipated &quot;The Fires of Midway&quot;, a fast-paced and exciting game which allows players to recreate all four of the 1942 carrier battles.

<text>The Gamers was a wargaming company founded and run by Dean Essig in Homer, Illinois. Their distinction was the focus on a few series, with special rules for each individual game. This made it easier to play new games within a series that was well known to the players. Homercon, a convention for The Gamers games was held each September in Homer, IL from 1990 until 2012. This company was bought out by Multi-Man Publishing in 2001 who continues to publish new materials for the original Gamers series and new games and game series.

==Games==
The Gamers produce games in several different series:

* CWB – The &quot;Civil War Brigade Series&quot; simulates battles at the brigade level during the American Civil War.
* RSS/LoB – The &quot;Regimental Sub-System Series / Line of Battle&quot; simulates battles at the regimental level during the American Civil War.g
* TCS – The &quot;Tactical Combat Series&quot; simulates 20th century platoon level battles.
* OCS – The &quot;Operational Combat Series&quot; simulates 20th century battles at levels ranging from battalions to divisions.
* SCS – The &quot;Standard Combat Series&quot; is a general system which is easy (yet still challenging) and allows simulation of a wide range of battles.
* NBS – The &quot;Napoleonic Brigade Series&quot; simulates brigade level battles during the Napoleonic Wars.
* BCS – The &quot;Battalion Combat Series&quot; simulates 20th century battles at the battalion level.

<text>The Bishop of Aberdeen (originally Bishop of Mortlach, in Latin Murthlacum) was the ecclesiastical head of the Diocese of Aberdeen, one of Scotland&#x27;s 13 medieval bishoprics, whose first recorded bishop is an early 12th-century cleric named Nechtan. It appears that the episcopal seat had previously been at Mortlach (Mòrthlach), but was moved to Aberdeen during the reign of King David I of Scotland. The names of three bishops of Mortlach are known, the latter two of whom, &quot;Donercius&quot; and &quot;Cormauch&quot; (Cormac), by name only. The Bishop of Aberdeen broke communion with the Roman Catholic Church after the Scottish Reformation. Following the Revolution of 1688, the office was abolished in the Church of Scotland, but continued in the Scottish Episcopal Church. A Roman Catholic Diocese of Aberdeen was recreated in 1878.

==Pre-Reformation bishops==
===List of known bishops of Mortlach===

===List of known bishops of Aberdeen===
The Bishopric of Aberdeen, as the Bishopric of Aberdeen, appears to date from the 1130s, as does the list of known bishops. 
==Post-Reformation bishops==

===Church of Scotland succession===
===Scottish Episcopal Church succession===
===Restored Roman Catholic succession===
(Any dates appearing in italics indicate &quot;de facto &quot; continuation of office. The start date of tenure below is the date of appointment or succession. Where known, the date of installation and ordination as bishop are listed in the notes together with the post held prior to appointment.)

The modern Bishop of Aberdeen is the Ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aberdeen in the Province of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh. The diocese covers 29,068 km2. The see is in the City of Aberdeen where the seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Mary of the Assumption. The Apostolic Vicariate of the Northern District (formerly the Apostolic Vicariate of the Highland District) was elevated to diocese status on 4 March 1878. The current bishop is the Right Reverend Hugh Gilbert, 11th Bishop of Aberdeen.

<doc id="1082338" wikidata="Q1054486" url="?curid=1082338" title="Game Designers' Workshop">
<text>Game Designers&#x27; Workshop (GDW) was a wargame and role-playing game publisher from 1973 to 1996. Many of their games are now carried by other publishers.

==History==
Game Designers&#x27; Workshop was originally established June 22, 1973. The founding members consisted of Frank Chadwick, Rich Banner, Marc Miller, and Loren Wiseman. GDW acquired the Conflict Games Company from John Hill in the early 1970s.

GDW published a new product approximately every twenty-two days for over twenty years. In an effort to bridge the gap between role players, board wargamers and miniature wargamers, the company published RPGs with fantastic settings alongside games with realistic themes including rulesets for 15mm and 20mm miniatures set during the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the modern era; and boardgames involving these eras such as the &quot;Air Superiority&quot; series and &quot;Harpoon&quot;.

The company disbanded February 29, 1996 after suffering financial troubles.

<doc id="1082339" wikidata="Q130215" url="?curid=1082339" title="Pablo Aimar">
<text>Pablo César Aimar (born 3 November 1979) is an Argentine former professional footballer and current assistant coach of the Argentina national team. During his career, he played as an attacking midfielder.

After starting his senior career at River Plate in 1996, Aimar amassed La Liga totals of 215 games and 32 goals over eight seasons with Valencia and Zaragoza from 2001 to 2008, before spending five years in Portugal with Benfica, winning a combined nine major titles with the three teams.

Aimar earned 52 caps for the Argentina senior team over ten years, representing the nation in two FIFA World Cups and two Copa América tournaments, as well as a FIFA Confederations Cup. He reached the final of the 2005 Confederations Cup and the 2007 Copa América with the Argentine national side.

In 2018, Aimar joined the Argentina national team as an assistant coach. During his tenure, the team won the 2021 Copa América, the 2022 Finalissima, the 2022 World Cup, and the 2024 Copa América.

==Club career==
=== River Plate ===
Aimar&#x27;s football career begun in earnest when he was offered the chance to play for Estudiantes de Río Cuarto by youth coach Alfie Mercado. He trained with the club&#x27;s academy three times a week and it was there that he was spotted by River Plate who offered the chance to join their own academy. Aimar&#x27;s father initially prevented him from joining River as he felt he was too young to be playing football, but relented after manager Daniel Passarella personally asked him to allow his son to play. Having turned down the opportunity to attend medical school to pursue a career in football, Aimar made his debut for River on 11 August 1996 against Colón. His first goal for the club came on 20 February 1998 against Rosario Central. Aimar lifted five titles with River between 1996 and 2000, scoring 21 goals and recording 28 assists in 82 league appearances for the club, with his final appearance coming on 17 December 2000 in a 3–2 loss to Lanús.

=== Valencia ===
In January 2001, Spanish La Liga side Valencia signed Aimar from River for a club-record fee of €24 million (£13 million). He made his debut for the club the following month against Manchester United and drew praise from three-time Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Johan Cruyff for his performance after the match. The following weekend he scored on his La Liga debut, netting in a 2–0 away win over Las Palmas. Aimar immediately became a key figure in Valencia&#x27;s midfield under Héctor Cúper and helped the club reach the 2001 UEFA Champions League final, where they lost to Bayern Munich on penalties.

In the season which followed, Cúper left for Internazionale, and was replaced by Rafael Benítez. Aimar appeared in a total of 33 league games and scored 4 goals as Valencia were crowned 2001–02 La Liga champions for the first time in 31 years, ending as the club&#x27;s third-highest goalscorer across all competitions for the season. The season thereafter, Aimar jointly topped the Champions League assists table alongside Rui Costa of Milan with five assists to his name, this despite Valencia being eliminated at the quarter-final stage. The club endured further disappointment by ending the league season in fifth place.

The club&#x27;s failures were soon forgotten, however, as Valencia completed a league and UEFA Cup double the following season. Despite making more than 30 appearances for the season and playing an influential role in the club&#x27;s UEFA Cup triumph, Aimar was sidelined for large parts of the season in what was to set an injury-plagued tone to his career.

Following a breakdown between Benítez and Valencia&#x27;s sporting director Jesús García Pitarch, the former left his position at the club and was replaced by Italian manager Claudio Ranieri for the 2004–05 season. A combination of injury concerns and tactical changes from the manager saw Aimar struggle under Ranieri and found himself being employed as a substitute more frequently than before. The Italian departed the club in February and was replaced by Antonio López, who in turn was replaced by Quique Sánchez Flores for the following season. With Valencia in decline, Aimar decided to leave the club at the end of the 2005–06 season having amassed over 200 appearances for the club over the course of five-and-a-half seasons.

=== Zaragoza ===
In the summer of 2006, Aimar joined fellow top flight club Real Zaragoza on a four-year deal for a reported fee of €11 million, with the club describing the deal as the most important signing in the club&#x27;s history. At Zaragoza, he was reunited with compatriot and former Valencia teammate Roberto Ayala, who himself had joined the club earlier in the month. Aimar made his league debut on 27 August in a 2–3 away loss against Deportivo de La Coruña and went on to make 32 appearances across all competitions, scoring five goals and helping the club to a sixth-place finish in the league. The following season was a disastrous one for Aimar and Zaragoza as the club, fraught with poor performances and financial mismanagement were relegated from La Liga. Zaragoza&#x27;s relegation saw Aimar bring an end to his time in Aragon, having made 57 appearances during his two-season stay with the club. During his stint with Zaragoza, he obtained dual-Spanish nationality, having lived in the country since 2001.

=== Benfica ===
On 17 July 2008, Aimar signed a four-year contract with Portuguese side Benfica for a fee of €6.5 million. After struggling with injuries initially, he finished the campaign with a string of strong performances and was able to add a Taça da Liga title to his name.

In the 2009–10 season, Aimar was reunited with former River Plate teammate Javier Saviola, who was let go by Real Madrid following his own injury struggles. The two combined as double &quot;trequartista&quot; to support striker Óscar Cardozo alongside fellow Argentine Ángel Di María on the wing. The quartet formed the Primeira Liga&#x27;s most dangerous attack, with Benfica scoring 78 goals on their way to a league and cup double.

Aimar had become a fan favourite at the Estádio da Luz but injuries continued to plague him, and his game time reduced in the coming seasons. In spite of this, he helped the club to its third and fourth consecutive Taça da Liga titles. On 6 June 2013, after 179 official appearances, 17 goals and 34 assists, Aimar announced he was leaving Benfica and thanked the club for &quot;five wonderful years&quot;.

=== Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim ===
On 7 August 2013, Tunku Ismail Ibrahim, the president of Malaysian club Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim, confirmed that Aimar had signed a two-year contract with the team. Upon arrival, he became the highest paid player ever to feature in the Malaysia Super League. He made his debut in the league six months after signing, in a 2–0 win against Perak FA. Prior to making his debut, Aimar had previously played at the Larkin Stadium, home of Johor, before with Argentina in the 1997 Youth World Cup. He ultimately made 8 appearances for the club and scored two goals before a spate of injuries resulted in him being released on 21 April 2014. Aimar did earn a champions medal for his time with JDT, though, as the club went on to lift the Super League title at the end of the season.

=== Return to River Plate ===
On 5 January 2015, Aimar returned to River Plate for the club&#x27;s pre-season training, stating that he would sign with the club only if he could deal with the physical demand after having undergone surgeries to his heel and not having played since leaving Johor Darul Ta’zim in April 2014. On 31 May, he played as substitute in a home win against Rosario Central in the Primera División. Aimar announced his retirement on 14 July 2015 after River Plate coach Marcelo Gallardo informed him that he was not included in the club&#x27;s squad for the semi-final stage of the Copa Libertadores. Gallardo said Aimar was &quot;suffering&quot; and had struggled with injuries through the pre-season.

=== Estudiantes de Río Cuarto ===
On 16 January 2018, Aimar played in a friendly match for his youth club Estudiantes de Río Cuarto. After the match, he announced that he would be joining the squad ahead of the Copa Argentina fixture against Sportivo Belgrano on 23 January, in order to fulfill his wish of making an official appearance for the club where he began and spent eight years.

The Copa Argentina match took place at Estudiantes&#x27; home stadium &quot;Estadio Ciudad de Río Cuarto&quot;. Aimar was picked in the starting line up and wore the captain&#x27;s armband, coming close to opening the score with a shot that was parried by the goalkeeper, before getting subbed off in the 50th minute. The match ended in a goalless draw, which was not enough to see Estudiantes through the next round after a 2–1 loss in the first leg. His brother Andrés was also in the line-up of Estudiantes. Afterwards, Aimar confirmed that he had no intention of making a definitive comeback and that this was indeed his farewell match from football.

==International career==
Aimar first represented Argentina at youth levels. Along with future senior team players Esteban Cambiasso and Juan Román Riquelme he won the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship and went on to earn 52 senior caps following his debut in 1999, scoring eight international goals in total. He represented Argentina at the 1999 and 2007 editions of the Copa América, at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, and at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.

In the 2002 World Cup, for which he was picked ahead of Riquelme, Aimar appeared against England, subbing in for Juan Sebastián Verón in the 1–0 loss, which led coach Marcelo Bielsa to start him against Sweden at the latter&#x27;s expense.

Aimar scored the last goal of the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup during Argentina&#x27;s 4–1 loss in the final to champions Brazil. He also appeared with the national side in the 2007 Copa América, scoring a goal in a 4–1 win against the United States in his team&#x27;s opening group match of the competition; Argentina went on to reach the final of the tournament, losing out to Brazil once again, this time 0–3, with Aimar coming on as a second-half substitute for Cambiasso.

After several months in the sidelines, Aimar received another international callup in October 2009, for decisive 2010 World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Uruguay. In the match against the former he repaid the faith placed in him by coach Diego Maradona, assisting Gonzalo Higuaín for Argentina&#x27;s opener with a through ball, in an eventual 2–1 win.

==Style of play==
An elegant, technically gifted and creative attacking midfielder with a small frame, Aimar was a right-footed player with a vast array of skills and an eye for goal. He excelled in a free role as an advanced playmaker where he was best able to utilise his dribbling skills, vision and passing ability to create chances for teammates and orchestrate attacking moves. Moreover, he was a free kick specialist. His skills and playing style saw him earn comparisons with Diego Maradona in his youth. Due to his talent and flamboyance, he was given the nicknames &quot;El Payaso&quot; (the clown) and &quot;El Mago&quot; (the wizard) throughout his career. As a youth, compatriot Lionel Messi stated in 2002 that Aimar was one of his biggest influences as a player. In addition to his playing ability, Aimar also drew praise for his leadership qualities; however, despite his talent, he struggled with injuries throughout his career.

==Coaching career==
Aimar was appointed as coach of the Argentina national under-17 football team in July 2017. His under-17 team won the South American U-17 Championship in 2019.
He was part of the Argentina managerial team who won the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

==Personal life==
Aimar&#x27;s younger brother, Andrés, was also a professional footballer and a midfielder. He represented several teams in his country – starting his career at River Plate – also playing for a few months in Israel. In October 2022 Aimar&#x27;s mother died.

<doc id="1082342" wikidata="Q7598125" url="?curid=1082342" title="Stand and Deliver (Adam and the Ants song)">
<text>&quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; is a song by British new wave band Adam and the Ants, released as the lead single from their third studio album, &quot;Prince Charming&quot; (1981). It was the band&#x27;s first No. 1 hit in the UK. The phrase &quot;stand and deliver — your money or your life&quot;, used in the lyrics, is commonly associated with highwaymen in 18th century England.

==Release==
Adam and the Ants&#x27; previous single, &quot;Antmusic&quot;, debuted on the UK Singles Chart on 6 December 1980. It spent nine weeks in the top 10, peaking at No. 2, but was denied the No. 1 position by the re-release of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; after his murder in New York City on 8 December 1980.

&quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; became the band&#x27;s first No. 1 when it debuted at the top spot on 3 May 1981, and remained there for five weeks. Listed as the third best-selling single of 1981, it has sold 1.03 million copies in the UK, and was in 2023 included on the Official Charts Company&#x27;s list of the UK&#x27;s best-selling singles of all time at number 141.
On the US Dance chart, &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; peaked at #38.

Copies of the single &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; b/w &quot;Beat My Guest&quot; were included as a free bonus item with some vinyl copies of the US version of the album &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; on Epic Records. Epic&#x27;s cassette edition appended the two tracks to each end of either side of the tape. A slightly different version of &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; was then featured on their follow-up LP, &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, released in November 1981.

==Music video==
The costume and general plot of the video show a strong influence from the 1973 Monty Python sketch &quot;Dennis Moore&quot;, although the highwayman scenario had also recently formed the basis for the &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; series on UK television, starring Richard O&#x27;Sullivan in the title role. It features Adam Ant dressed as a &quot;dandy highwayman&quot; who threatens his victims with the mirror image of their unfashionable selves and who is captured and escapes being hanged from the gallows with help from his accomplices (his band members).

The video&#x27;s opening sequence of Adam Ant putting on his make-up before going out on a robbery became a defining visual image for Adam Ant in the years that followed; a still from this was used as the sleeve for the band&#x27;s next single. The video also features the second appearance of Amanda Donohoe, who had also appeared in the previous video for &quot;Antmusic&quot;. At the time, she was Adam Ant&#x27;s girlfriend.

==Charts==
===Weekly charts===
===Year-end charts===
==&quot;Beat My Guest&quot;==
It was fairly common for Ant to record new versions of his pre-1980 compositions for the B-side of his singles. For this single, an old Ant song dating back at least to May 1977 was used. &quot;Beat My Guest&quot; was the first song Adam and the Ants played at their official debut gig at the Institute of Contemporary Arts restaurant on 10 May 1977. A full band recording was made in the same 14 July 1977 Chappell Studios recording session that had produced the version of Plastic Surgery featured in Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Jubilee&quot;. The version on the B-side of this single was recorded in August 1980 during sessions for the &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot; album and featured the band&#x27;s previous bass player Kevin Mooney.

==Legacy==
&quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; has been covered by Poppy and by indie bands (Society Burning, Lynyrd&#x27;s Innards, among others). Sugar Ray provided the first notable cover on their 1997 release, &quot;Floored&quot;.

In 2008, it was featured as part of the &quot;Burnout Paradise&quot; soundtrack.

In 2011, it was featured in &quot;Saints Row: The Third&quot; on the in-game radio station The Mix 107.77.

In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation&#x27;s 15th favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.

The CBBC show &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; based their Dick Turpin song on it.

==No Doubt version==
In 2009, American rock band No Doubt recorded a cover version of &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;. They performed the song while playing a fictional 1980s band, Snowed Out, in the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; episode &quot;Valley Girls&quot;, airing 11 May 2009, and also performed the song on their 2009 tour during the encore. It was eventually included on the deluxe edition bonus disc of the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Push and Shove&quot;, released on 21 September 2012.

==&quot;Save the Gorilla&quot;==
In 2003, Adam Ant embarked upon an ill-fated attempt to raise awareness of the plight of the endangered mountain gorilla in Central Africa by reworking &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; into &quot;Save the Gorilla&quot;. This was to have been the lead track of a five track EP (with the remaining four tracks all being covers chosen for a jungle/primate theme) of which 2000 copies were pressed. Co-writer Marco Pirroni and the original song publishers EMI Publishing blocked its release just days before its intended release on 17 November, and the EP was withdrawn. One EP track, a cover of &quot;Jungle Rock&quot;, eventually surfaced on collaborator Boz Boorer&#x27;s 2008 solo album &quot;Miss Pearl&quot;.

<text>GMT Games is a California-based wargaming publisher founded in 1990. The company has become well known for graphically attractive games that range from &quot;monster games&quot;, of many maps and counters, to quite simple games suitable for introducing new players to wargaming. They also produce card games and family games. The current management and creative team includes Tony Curtis, Rodger MacGowan, Mark Simonitch, and Andy Lewis.

==History==
GMT&#x27;s name comes from the first name initials of founders Gene Billingsley, Mike Crane, and Terry Shrum. Crane and Shrum later left GMT and founded the Fresno Gaming Association.

In the 1990s GMT pioneered a pre-order system called &quot;Project 500&quot; or &quot;P500&quot;, where customers pre-order a title and production does not begin until a set minimum of orders had been reached. This system has been adopted by other wargame publishers. GMT was successful during the 1990s, when other war game publishers were failing, which has been credited in part to their innovative P500 system.

GMT is known for publishing the COIN series of games, which started with &quot;Andean Abyss: Insurgency and Counterinsurgency in Colombia&quot; by Volko Ruhnke, a CIA instructor. Most COIN titles feature four playable factions commanding guerrilla forces or conventional military forces, both trying to win the hearts and minds of the local population. The games focus on historical conflicts such as the Cuban Revolution, Vietnam War, Gallic Wars, American Revolution, War in Afghanistan, and others.

GMT&#x27;s best-known game may be &quot;Twilight Struggle,&quot; a card-driven strategy game about the global Cold War. In 2018, GMT began creating Windows and mobile adaptations for some of their titles, including &quot;Twilight Struggle&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth: The War on Terror&quot;.

GMT was about to publish &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; in 2019, but pulled the title after controversy erupted about its subject matter.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; called GMT &quot;the modern hobby&#x27;s highest-profile wargame publisher&quot; and characterized P500 as a &quot;Kickstarter before Kickstarter that allowed fans to vote with their wallets on which GMT games should come to market&quot;. &quot;Wargamer Magazine&quot; called them a &quot;house-name in table-top wargaming&quot;. &quot;VICE News&quot; said they are &quot;one of the biggest and most successful [companies], with one of the largest libraries.&quot;

==Published games==
Some of the better-known games produced by GMT Games include:

* &quot;18XX&quot; series - strategy economic board games about railway construction and investing in railroad companies.
* &quot;Battle Line&quot;
* &quot;Chandragupta&quot;
* &quot;COIN&quot; series - a card-driven action board game series based on counterinsurgency and irregular warfare.
* &quot;Combat Commander&quot; series - a card-drive game, simulating tactical warfare usually in World War 2.
* &quot;Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients&quot; - a block game with card-driven action, based upon tactical combat in the Classical Period.
* &quot;Dominant Species&quot;
*&quot;Down in Flames&quot; series of air combat cards games that includes &quot;Rise of the Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Eighth Air Force&quot;
* &quot;Europe Engulfed&quot;
* &quot;Fields of Fire&quot;
* &quot;Here I Stand&quot;
* &quot;MBT&quot; series - wargame series that is modeling the hypothetical clash set in 1987 between US and Soviet forces in Germany. Later expansion added British, West German, and Canadian forces.
* &quot;Next War&quot; series - wargame series that is based on hypothetical war on modern times.
* &quot;Panzer&quot; series - a detailed, tactical-level, World War II game based in the European theater, currently with 4 expansion sets.
* &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;
*&quot;Space Empires 4X&quot;
* &quot;Sword of Rome&quot;
* &quot;SPQR&quot;
* &quot;Twilight Struggle -&quot; card-driven board game, based on the Cold War.
* &quot;Wing Leader&quot; series - aerial combat wargames series with side-scrolling views, mainly based on World War II era aircraft.

<doc id="1082345" wikidata="Q1591356" url="?curid=1082345" title="Bishop of Dunkeld">
<text>The Bishop of Dunkeld is the ecclesiastical head of the Diocese of Dunkeld, one of the largest and more important of Scotland&#x27;s 13 medieval bishoprics, whose first recorded bishop is an early 12th-century cleric named Cormac. However, the first known abbot dates to the 10th century, and it is often assumed that in Scotland in the period before the 12th century, the roles of both bishop and abbot were one and the same. The Bishopric of Dunkeld ceased to exist as a Catholic institution after the Scottish Reformation but continued as a royal institution into the 17th century. The diocese was restored (with a different boundary) by Pope Leo XIII on 4 March 1878; it is now based in the city of Dundee.

==List of known abbots==
Dunkeld Abbey was an offshoot of Iona, perhaps founded in the early 9th century, in the reign of Caustantín mac Fergusa, King of the Picts. It is not clear when its abbots got independence from the Abbots of Iona, but a notable event is the alleged transfer of the relics of Columba to Dunkeld during the reign of the Scoto-Pictish king Cináed mac Ailpín. Its abbots, like many Gaelic abbots of the period, took a strong role in secular affairs, hence the term &quot;lay abbot&quot;. The following is a list of known abbots of Dunkeld; the list is not exhaustive.
While it is true that medieval churchmen took an active part in secular affairs (some fought in battles), that didn&#x27;t make them in any sense &quot;lay.&quot; They were still consecrated bishops or abbots. A &quot;lay abbot&quot; was the secular lord of the abbey&#x27;s lands. Since an abbey&#x27;s property was often extensive, it was lucrative plum. Medieval monarchs enjoyed considerable authority over the church, and doubtless, these positions were awarded to royal favorites.

==List of known pre-Reformation bishops==
The Bishopric of Dunkeld was one of the largest in medieval Scotland. However, in 1200, half of its territory was used to create the new Bishopric of Argyll.

===List of Schism anti-bishops===
==List of post-Reformation bishops==

===Church of Scotland succession===
In 1560 the Church of Scotland broke its ties with Rome.
===Scottish Episcopal Church succession===
===Roman Catholic succession===
The Bishop of Dunkeld is the Ordinary of the Catholic Diocese of Dunkeld in the Province of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh. The diocese covers an area of 9,505 km2. The see is in the City of Dundee where the seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew. The post Reformation diocese was restored by Pope Leo XIII on 4 March 1878. The Right Reverend Stephen Robson is the 9th bishop of the diocese since its restoration.

<doc id="1082352" wikidata="Q1837136" url="?curid=1082352" title="Bishop of Galloway">
<text>The Bishop of Galloway, also called the Bishop of Whithorn, is the ecclesiastical head of the Diocese of Galloway, said to have been founded by Saint Ninian in the mid-5th century. The subsequent Anglo-Saxon bishopric was founded in the late 7th century or early 8th century, and the first known bishop was one Pehthelm, &quot;shield of the Picts&quot;. According to Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical tradition, the bishopric was founded by Saint Ninian, a later corruption of the British name Uinniau or Irish Finian; although there is no contemporary evidence, it is quite likely that there had been a British or Hiberno-British bishopric before the Anglo-Saxon takeover. After Heathored (fl. 833), no bishop is known until the apparent resurrection of the diocese in the reign of King Fergus of Galloway. The bishops remained, uniquely for Scottish bishops, the suffragans of the Archbishop of York until 1359 when the pope released the bishopric from requiring metropolitan assent. James I formalised the admission of the diocese into the Scottish church on 26 August 1430 and just as all Scottish sees, Whithorn was to be accountable directly to the pope. The diocese was placed under the metropolitan jurisdiction of St Andrews on 17 August 1472 and then moved to the province of Glasgow on 9 January 1492. The diocese disappeared during the Scottish Reformation, but was recreated by the Catholic Church in 1878 with its cathedra at Dumfries, although it is now based at Ayr.

==Pre-Reformation bishops==

===List of known Anglo-Saxon bishops of Whithorn===

Heathored is described as the successor to Beadwulf by some accounts. His inclusion on the list as a Bishop of Whithorn is not credible.

===List of known bishops of Galloway/Whithorn===
==Post-Reformation bishops==

===Church of Scotland succession===
===Scottish Episcopal Church succession===
===Restored Roman Catholic succession===
The modern Bishop of Galloway is the Ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Galloway in the Province of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh.

The diocese was resurrected on 4 March 1878 from the Vicariate Apostolic of the Western District. The church of Saint Andrew in Dumfries served as pro-cathedral until it was destroyed by a fire in May 1961 and the seat moved to Ayr in 1962. The diocese covers an area of 9,332 km². The see is in the Ecclesiastical City of Ayr. Until 2007 the seat was located at the Cathedral Church of the Good Shepherd which was built in 1957. In early 2007 Pope Benedict XVI accepted the petition of Right Reverend John Cunningham, the 7th Bishop of Galloway, to move the seat to St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Ayr. After this took place, the Church of the Good Shepherd was closed and largely demolished.

<text>Moves was a wargaming magazine originally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.), which also published manual wargames. Their flagship magazine &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot; (&quot;S&amp;T&quot;), was a military history magazine featuring a new wargame in each issue. While S&amp;T was devoted to historical articles, &quot;Moves&quot; focused on the play of the games. Each issue carried articles dealing with strategies for different wargames, tactical tips, and many variants and scenarios for existing games. As time passed, reviews of new games also became an important feature. While the majority of the articles dealt with SPI games, the magazine was open to and published many articles on games by other companies.

Founded by Jim Dunnigan, &quot;Moves&quot; began publication in 1972. SPI carried a huge inventory of their games and was very successful as a direct mail marketer of their games. But with the rise of role-playing games and multimillion-dollar sales for that arm of gaming, SPI expanded into hobby shops and increased its market. However, retail meant significantly higher print runs and lower margins, and with the rapid inflation of the 1970s, the rise in paper costs put them in a financial bind. When the recession of 1980-81 hit, the company found itself short of cash and unable to continue without a loan. TSR appeared to be a savior, making the loan a promissory note, but then reversed course and demanded payment. &quot;Moves&quot; were among the assets acquired by TSR. The final issue (#60) of the original run was published in December 1981.

A second run of issues began publication in 1991 with issue #61, when 3W ceased publication of &quot;The Wargamer&quot; in favor of restarting the well-known &quot;Moves&quot; title. It was bought, along with &quot;Fire &amp; Movement&quot; and &quot;Strategy &amp; Tactics&quot;, by Decision Games and continued publishing into the 21st Century.

<text>Dunston Pillar is a Grade II listed stone tower in Lincolnshire, England and a former &#x27;land lighthouse&#x27;. It stands beside the A15 road approximately south of Lincoln near the junction of the B1178 (also known as Tower Lane), in the parish of Dunston, north of Sleaford. Closed to the public. On private land.

== History ==

The original land lighthouse was commissioned by Sir Francis Dashwood (better known as the founder of the Knights of St Francis, which became the Monks of Medmenham, later called a Hellfire Club) in 1751 as a gift to his wife Sarah (Ellys) Dashwood, who feared crossing the dark heath near her childhood home, Nocton. The purpose of the land lighthouse was to improve the safety of 18th-century travellers crossing a particularly treacherous area of the county known for its many incidents of robbery by highwaymen. In the 1843 &quot;Journal of the Agricultural Society&quot; it was described as the &quot;only land light-house ever raised&quot;.

The structure originally stood high, with a staircase inside the tower and a large octagonal lantern on top to aid travellers crossing the wild heathland south of Lincoln. The lantern was regularly lit until 1788 and was used for the last time in 1808 by which time improvements in the local road network had made it effectively obsolete.

Sir Francis landscaped the base of Dunston Tower with a plantation of trees and a bowling green. It became a popular gathering place for picnics, tea parties, quoits and cards. A two-storey dining hall was later added. The vicar of Welbourn called it &quot;the Vauxhall&quot; of Lincolnshire, and the Lincoln Club was formed to arrange entertainments there.


In 1808, the lantern was destroyed in a storm and was replaced in 1810 by the 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire, in celebration of the Golden Jubilee of George III, with a Coade stone (lithodipyra) statue of King George III sculpted by Joseph Panzetta for Eleanor Coade.

In 1940, the pillar was considered to be a hazard to low-flying aircraft approaching nearby RAF Coleby Grange, and the tower&#x27;s height was lowered by to reduce the risk of accident. At this time the oversize statue of George III was removed and broken up; the surviving bust can be seen in the grounds of Lincoln Castle. The statue is a listed building in its own right.

The tower remains a well-known landmark and to this day is clearly visible beside the busy road at .

<text> (died June 1180), also known as the Takakura Prince, and as Minamoto no Mochimitsu (源 以光), was a son of Emperor Go-Shirakawa of Japan. He is noted for his role in starting the Genpei War.

Believing that Taira no Kiyomori was causing suffering, Mochihito supported the Minamoto clan in their conflict against the Taira. At the same time, Minamoto no Yorimasa led the Minamoto clan in supporting Mochihito&#x27;s bid for the Imperial Throne. In May 1180, Yorimasa sent out a call to other Minamoto leaders, and to the monasteries (Enryakuji, Miidera and others) that Kiyomori had offended; he asked for aid against the Taira, in the name of Prince Mochihito.

Learning of this, Kiyomori sent men after Mochihito, who retreated to Miidera, at the foot of Mount Hiei, but discovered that the warrior monks of Miidera, for various political reasons, could not rely on the support of any other monasteries. Thus, he fled once more, along with a small Minamoto force, across the River Uji, to the Phoenix Hall of the Byōdō-in. There they were caught by the Taira forces, and the Battle of Uji was fought. The bridge was the site of much of the fighting, and the planks were famously smashed to impair the ability of the Taira to cross, but eventually the Minamoto were forced back into the Phoenix Hall, where Yorimasa committed seppuku. Mochihito escaped, but was captured on his way and killed soon afterwards.

<doc id="1082360" wikidata="Q2719655" url="?curid=1082360" title="Andy Williams (Jamaican footballer)">
<text>Andrew Williams (born 23 September 1977) is a Canadian-Jamaican retired footballer who last played as a midfielder for Real Salt Lake in Major League Soccer.

==Career==

===College===
Williams played college soccer for the University of Rhode Island where he remains the team&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, with 52 goals and 45 assists.

Williams is one of 22 college players to be part of the 40-40 club, having both 40 goals and 40 assists in their college career. As of 2018, he is the most recent member of the 40-40 club.

===Professional===
After spending a couple of years in his home country with Real Mona, Williams joined Major League Soccer in 1998 with the Columbus Crew, with whom he would play for two seasons. In 2000, he moved to the Miami Fusion, but would only remain there one year before going to the New England Revolution. Williams played in 2001 and beginning of 2002 with New England, before moving to the MetroStars in a six-player deal in the middle of the 2002 season. He only lasted half a season with the Metros, soon traded again, to the Chicago Fire, with whom he played for two years.

Williams became the second player in Real Salt Lake history when he was their first selection in the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft. He became the first player in MLS history to play for six teams. In his ten years in the league, Williams has scored 27 goals and added 78 assists.
After leading Jamaica to the Caribbean title in 2008, Williams suffered through the prolonged illness of his wife during the 2009 season, which culminated with Real Salt Lake winning the MLS Cup in November 2009. The Williams family received further good news in late 2009/early 2010 as Marcia Williams&#x27; cancer went into remission. In 2010, Williams returned to Real Salt Lake focused and re-energized.

Williams&#x27; contract with Real Salt Lake ended after the 2011 season and he opted to participate in the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. After he was not selected in Stage 1 of the draft, Williams announced his retirement from professional soccer on 5 December 2011.

In 2014 Andy Williams joined the coaching staff for Real Salt Lake when new head coach, Jeff Cassar, named him as an assistant coach (Midfield coach) and in addition to his assistant coach duties. Andy oversaw and coached the reserve team for Real Salt Lake.
Williams became Head Scout at Real Salt Lake, and has since played an integral part in the signings of several players.

===International===
Despite being something of a journeyman in Major League Soccer, Williams has been a stalwart for the Jamaica national team. He has 97 caps with the team and 13 goals, and was often the focal point of their offense, running the team from the central midfield. Williams played for his country in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, making one substitute appearance. Williams retired from the Jamaican team following their failure to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Despite his initial retirement, Williams was called in for a June 2008 friendly vs. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, in which he played the full 90. Williams was also called in for Jamaica&#x27;s 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign and played five games, scoring against Canada in a 1–1 draw.

==Personal life==
Andy Williams was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but grew up in Kingston, Jamaica. His father, Bobby Williams, played for the Jamaica national team in the 1960s. He married Shauna Williams on April 24, 2021.

<text>The Archbishop of Glasgow is an archiepiscopal title that takes its name after the city of Glasgow in Scotland. The position and title were abolished by the Church of Scotland in 1689; and, in the Catholic Church, the title was restored by Pope Leo XIII in 1878. In the Scottish Episcopal Church, it is now part of the Episcopal bishopric of Glasgow and Galloway.

The present Catholic archbishop is William Nolan, who was installed on 26 February 2022.

==History==
The Diocese of Glasgow originates in the period of the reign of David I, Prince of the Cumbrians, but the earliest attested bishops come from the 11th century, appointees of the Archbishop of York. The episcopal seat was located at Glasgow Cathedral. In 1492, the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese by Pope Innocent VIII. After the Scottish church broke its links with Rome in 1560, the archbishopric continued under the independent Scottish church until 1689 when Episcopacy in the established Church of Scotland was finally abolished in favour of Presbyterianism, requiring bishopric continuity to occur in the disestablished Scottish Episcopal Church.

In the following centuries Roman Catholicism slowly began a process of re-introduction, culminating in 1829 with legalisation through the Catholic Emancipation Act. A new papally-appointed archbishopric in the Roman Catholic Church was introduced when the Vicariate Apostolic of the Western District was elevated to archdiocese status on 4 March 1878 on the restoration of the Scottish hierarchy, and then to metropolitan archdiocese status on 25 May 1947.

In 1978, Scoon was appointed Governor-General of Grenada by Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of the Prime Minister, Sir Eric Gairy. However, the following year, the New Jewel Movement — led by Maurice Bishop and Scoon&#x27;s former pupils, Bernard Coard and Hudson Austin — overthrew Gairy in a popularly supported, nearly bloodless coup.

Initially arrested by the militants, Scoon was soon released with an apology. The insurgents wanted to continue Grenada&#x27;s status as a constitutional monarchy and retain the position of Governor-General to represent the monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. Scoon and Bishop managed to maintain a semi-normal working relationship, despite the fact that Scoon strongly opposed the Marxist-Leninist principles of Bishop&#x27;s leftist government. The revolutionaries regarded Scoon as a useful figurehead who would smooth international recognition for their new regime and also facilitate their relations with Canada and the United Kingdom. Scoon was happy to remain in office, providing a degree of stability in the situation, despite irritation at the curtailment of some of his privileges. He played tennis with Bishop and maintained his reputation for discretion.

===Role in the 1983 U.S. invasion===
Bishop was in turn deposed by a counter-coup and executed on 12 October 1983, which was orchestrated by Bernard Coard, Bishop&#x27;s erstwhile friend and governing partner. In the course of a continuing power struggle, Bishop and three of his closest ministers were executed on 19 October by People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army soldiers loyal to the Coard faction. A 16-member military council led by Hudson Austin then declared martial law and asserted iron-fisted control over the fractured nation. Scoon, acting through secret diplomatic channels, asked the United States and concerned Caribbean nations to intervene to restore peace and order to the island. The invasion coalition maintained that Scoon was within his rights to do so, acting under the reserve powers vested in the Crown. However, an independent expert examination later found a dubious constitutional basis for Scoon&#x27;s call for foreign intervention and his assumption of executive and legislative power. On 25 October, the invasion of Grenada (codenamed Operation Urgent Fury) was launched by a joint U.S.-Caribbean force to depose Austin&#x27;s rule.

When the invasion occurred, one of the first steps was to free Governor-General Scoon, a task assigned to United States Navy SEALs. A SEAL unit arrived by Blackhawk helicopter under fire, and became trapped with Scoon at his official residence in the capital, St. George&#x27;s. After a day-long encirclement, Scoon, his family and staff, and 22 SEALs were liberated by Marines from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. The U.S. and Caribbean governments quickly reaffirmed Scoon as the Queen&#x27;s only legitimate representative in Grenada — and hence the only lawful authority on the island. On 27 October, the text of a letter from Scoon, dated 24 October, was publicly released, in which he requested armed intervention. The letter was cited as evidence that the invasion was not a unilateral U.S. act, but a regional police action. After the invasion, however, Scoon was anxious for U.S. forces to leave as soon as possible, stating a fortnight after the intervention that he &quot;cannot see people from abroad coming in to change our minds or souls and [the] whole heart of a society&quot; and that &quot;it is important that within the shortest possible time that we should live and work in a situation where security support takes the form of a police operation that will increasingly come under the command of a Grenadian or West Indian commissioner of police.&quot;

As per Commonwealth constitutional practice, Scoon became interim head of government and appointed an advisory council, which in turn named Nicholas Brathwaite as chairman and interim prime minister until post-invasion elections were held in 1984. Scoon retired from his post in 1992.

==Later life==
Scoon published a book entitled &quot;Survival for Service&quot; that provided a personal account of his experiences as Governor-General. In it, he denied writing the 24 October letter, saying it had been delivered to him in draft form on 26 October, after he was rescued. He did, however, confirm that he had asked for U.S. and Caribbean intervention. The accuracy of some of this book has been questioned by Richard Hart.

Scoon died on 2 September 2013. Although the cause of death was not announced, he had been a diabetic for many years.

<text>Lawrence O&#x27;Bryan Branch (November 28, 1820 – September 17, 1862) was an American politician who served as a representative for North Carolina in the U.S. Congress and a Confederate brigadier general in the American Civil War. He was killed in action at the Battle of Antietam. He owned 40 slaves.

==Early life and career==
Branch was born in Enfield, North Carolina to Major Joseph Branch and Susan Simpson O&#x27;Bryan Branch. His childhood home, The Cellar, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. His family moved to Williamson County, Tennessee but his mother died when he was five and his father died in 1827. His uncle, Secretary of the Navy John Branch (then serving as Governor of North Carolina) assumed his guardianship and took him back to North Carolina. Branch moved to Washington City with his uncle when the latter took the position as Secretary of the Navy and he was tutored by Salmon P. Chase. He pursued a preparatory course under a private teacher in Washington, D.C., before going on to train at North Carolina&#x27;s Bingham Military Academy. He also attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for a short time and, in 1838, graduated first in his class from Princeton College before going to study law in Nashville, Tennessee, where he also owned and edited a newspaper.

In 1840, Branch moved to Tallahassee, Florida and was admitted to the bar to practice law by a special act of the legislature. Just one year later, he went to fight in the Seminole Wars. In 1844, he married Nancy Haywood Blount and they had four children. In 1852, he moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he continued to practice law and became president of the Raleigh &amp; Gaston Railroad Co. He also served as an elector on the Franklin Pierce ticket in 1852. Branch was elected as a Democrat to the 34th, 35th, and 36th Congresses (March 4, 1855 - March 3, 1861) but was not a candidate for renomination in 1860. On December 29, 1859, he challenged Galusha Grow to a duel after the two exchanged insults on the House Floor. Both men and their seconds were arrested by District of Columbia police before the duel could take place. On December 2, 1860, he was appointed, (but declined), the position of Secretary of the Treasury by President James Buchanan.

==Civil War==
Branch entered the Confederate Army, in May 1861, as a private in the Raleigh Rifles. Later that month he accepted the office of state quartermaster general, but resigned it for service in the field. In September he was elected colonel of the 33rd North Carolina. He was appointed brigadier general in January 1862. After the Battle of New Bern, his brigade was attached to A.P. Hill&#x27;s Division of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s Corps. He was the senior brigadier general in Hill&#x27;s division. Branch&#x27;s brigade fought at the Battle of Hanover Courthouse, the Seven Days Battles, Cedar Mountain, Second Manassas, Chantilly, and Harper&#x27;s Ferry

===Antietam (Sharpsburg)===
On September 17, 1862, he led his troops on a rapid march from Harpers Ferry to Sharpsburg, Maryland where the Battle of Antietam was raging. Branch arrived on the field around 2:30 PM, in time to help stop the Union advance, thus saving General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s right flank from a crushing defeat. Soon after this victory, Branch stood talking with fellow brigadier generals Maxcy Gregg, Dorsey Pender, James J. Archer, along with Hill and General Lee when a Federal sharpshooter, seeing the group, fired a shot that hit him in the right cheek and exited behind his left ear, killing him instantly. The bullet also wounded General Gregg in the thigh. Branch fell dead into the arms of a staff officer.

===Dates of rank===
* Private, May 1, 1861
* Colonel, September 1, 1861
* Brigadier General, January 16, 1862

==Legacy==
A memorial cannon now stands at the location where Branch was killed. Five other memorial cannons are placed throughout the Antietam Battlefield marking the locations other commanders lost their lives. Branch is buried at the Old City Cemetery, Raleigh, North Carolina.

Author Armistead Maupin is Branch&#x27;s great-great-grandson.

<doc id="1082371" wikidata="Q8039486" url="?curid=1082371" title="Wyatt Creech">
<text>Wyatt Beetham Creech (born 13 October 1946) is a retired New Zealand politician. He served as the 14th deputy prime minister of New Zealand in Jenny Shipley&#x27;s National Party government from August 1998 to December 1999.

==Early life==
Creech was born in Oceanside, California, United States. His father, Jesse Wyatt Creech, hailed from North Carolina. Jesse had enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1939. He served in the 3rd Defense Battalion, which saw action at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the Battle of Midway Island in June 1942, and through the whole Guadalcanal Campaign from 7 August 1942 until early 1943.

Creech&#x27;s mother, a New Zealander, met his father when the 3rd Defense Battalion was deployed to Masterton, New Zealand, for rest and recovery following the successful conclusion of the Guadalcanal Campaign. When Creech was three months old, the family returned to New Zealand, settling in Wairarapa where his father became a sheep and beef farmer. Creech received his primary education in Masterton and his secondary education in Wanganui at Wanganui Collegiate. Initially Creech farmed at his family farm before obtaining an agricultural qualification at Massey University.

Following completion of that course, Creech travelled extensively overseas including an overland drive from India to the United Kingdom (passing through as well as India, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Italy, Switzerland and France).

Further travel took him extensively through Eastern Europe (including Russia). On his return to New Zealand he obtained a degree double majoring in political science and international politics from Victoria University of Wellington. After completing his degree, Creech again travelled overseas this time with his travels focussed on North America. He subsequently returned to Wairarapa and established a vineyard in the newly developing wine growing region of Martinborough.

==Entry into politics==



In the 1987 election, Creech contested the Wairarapa seat for the National Party. On election night, Creech won on the provisional vote count by 65 votes, and attended the first National caucus. The official count (completed two weeks later) reversed the election night provisional count and the constituency was won by the incumbent Labour Party MP, Reg Boorman by seven votes. Creech challenged that result with a petition under the provisions of the Electoral Act; supported initially by MPs Roger McClay and Winston Peters (who had been involved in recounts in Taupo and Hunua) but not the party hierarchy, according to Creech&#x27;s account in a book by Ross Meurant. A Judicial Recount, the initial step, saw Boorman&#x27;s lead reduced to one vote.

Creech then launched a full Electoral Petition on two counts. First, that a number who had voted in the election were not qualified to vote in the Wairarapa constituency on various grounds (including failure to qualify under the residency rules), and second, that Boorman had violated laws that set a limit on election spending by candidates. Boorman in his counter challenge also challenged a number of votes on various grounds. In all, more than 200 votes were reviewed by the Electoral Court. The process took eleven months to complete. On 12 July 1988, the Electoral Court found in Creech&#x27;s favour on both counts in its judgement on the Wairarapa Election Petition, and he took his seat immediately with a majority of 34 votes (9994 to 9960). Over his period as MP for Wairarapa his majority significantly increased from this narrow initial victory, increasing to over 7 thousand votes by the .

===Cabinet minister===
When the National Party won the 1990 election, Creech was appointed to the Cabinet of the fourth National government as its most junior member. Initially, his two main roles were Minister of Revenue (until 1996) and Minister of Customs (until 1993). Over the three terms of National-led governments he held a number of other Cabinet portfolios, including Associate (later Deputy) Minister of Finance (1991–1996), Minister for State Owned Enterprises (1993), Minister of Employment (1994–1996), Minister of Education (1996–1999), Minister for Courts (1997–1998), and Minister of Health (1999).

Creech chaired the cross party committees of MPs that developed the Superannuation Accord and the Employment Accord. Creech supported Jenny Shipley&#x27;s December 1997 party-room coup against Prime Minister Jim Bolger, and Creech became Deputy Leader of the National Party on 8 December 1997.

===Deputy Prime Minister===
In August 1998, the coalition between the National Party and New Zealand First broke down, and New Zealand First&#x27;s Winston Peters was sacked as Deputy Prime Minister. Shipley appointed Creech to fill the vacancy. However, barely a year later, the Shipley government was heavily defeated by Labour. Prior to this election, Creech had stood aside from contesting the Wairarapa Electorate as the National Party candidate and became a List MP. Under National Party rules, his position as Deputy Leader automatically put him in the second position on National&#x27;s party list, assuring his reelection despite National&#x27;s heavy losses. He was appointed a member of the Privy Council just before the election.

Creech became Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Minister of Health under Shipley. Creech remained as the party&#x27;s deputy leader until February 2001, when he chose to stand down. He was replaced by Bill English. Creech did not stand for re-election in the 2002 election.

==Post-politics career==
Following his retirement from politics, Creech headed up a small group that took advantage of the opportunities created by the deregulation of the dairy industry by the founding of the Open Country Cheese Company, located near Matamata, in Waikato. This has now grown into Open Country Dairy Co Ltd with both milk powder and cheese production facilities in Waharoa (near Matamata), Waikato, Awarua (near Invercargill) and Wanganui. The original cheese company was formed on 28 November 2001 (the date on which the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2001 received the Royal Assent. Manufacturing commenced in October 2004.

He stood down from the board of this company in 2008. In 2007 Creech and his associates launched as an offshoot from the commodity product manufacturing operation Open Country a new specialty cheese production focussed operation Kaimai Cheese (named after the local mountain range) and served from commencement as its Chairman.

He stood down from the board of this company in 2013 when their assets were sold to a new producer. In 2009 he joined the board of NZ Windfarms. retiring from that board in December 2013. Creech also served for a two-year period on the boards of Seales Limited, a Waikato-based stock feed manufacturing firm, the Cognition Education Trust, a trust supporting education research in New Zealand. he then joined the board of Healthcare Holdings Limited (providing various community-based health services).

In September 2009, Creech joined the New Zealand Fire Service Commission as Deputy Chair. As of mid 2014 he serves as Chair of the New Zealand Fire Service Commission and Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga (replacement Crown entity for the New Zealand Historic Places Trust) and Deputy Chair of Healthcare Holdings Limited.

In 2009–2010, Creech was commissioned by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of Local Government to head a review of the performance of Environment Canterbury. Their report was highly critical of the performance and capability of the organisation, and while the recommendations were controversial, were fully implemented by the government.

Creech served as part of the Solomon Islands International Election Observer Team in the 2001 General Election in that nation. He also led the New Zealand Election Observer Team in the August 2010 General Election in Solomon Islands. He also served on the International Election Observer Team for the Falkland Islands referendum on its future status in 2013.

Creech served from December 2004 until June 2006 as a director of investment and property company Bluechip. He resigned in June 2006. The company failed in November 2008. As former directors, Creech and John Luxton (who resigned in October 2006) were included (2012) in two lawsuits which alleged breach of their duty to investors. No in-court proceedings in relation to this claim eventuated, and in 2014 all legal claims against the former directors were abandoned.

In 2014, he was appointed chair of Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Board by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Chris Finlayson.

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Creech was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2003 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a Member of Parliament.

<text>The Archbishop of Cardiff-Menevia is the ordinary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cardiff-Menevia.

The position came about after the merger of the Archdiocese of Cardiff and the Diocese of Menevia in 2024, after the positions of bishops of those dioceses were held by the same person, Mark O&#x27;Toole. The archdiocese covers an area of and spans the historic county of Herefordshire and eastern South Wales. The metropolitan see of the previous archdiocese was in the city of Cardiff where the archbishop&#x27;s seat was located at the Metropolitan Cathedral Church of St David and the seat of the Diocese of Menevia was in St Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral, Swansea.

With the exception of the second archbishop, Francis Mostyn, born in Flintshire and of local descent, the Welsh connections of the archbishops and bishops have been extremely weak. Ireland, London and the English provinces have supplied a majority.

The see is currently held by Mark O&#x27;Toole, the 1st Archbishop of Cardiff-Menevia. He was originally the 8th and last Archbishop of Cardiff and 12th and last Bishop of Menevia, who was appointed by the Holy See on 27 April 2022 and installed at St David&#x27;s Cathedral, Cardiff on 20 June and St Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral, Swansea on 23 June 2022.

==History==
The Vicariate Apostolic of the Welsh District was created out of the Western District of England and Wales in 1840. The Welsh District covered all of the principality of Wales and the English county of Herefordshire. On the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales in 1850, the Welsh District was divided. The southern half became the Diocese of Newport and Menevia and the northern half became part of the Diocese of Shrewsbury. In 1895, the diocese lost territory on the creation of the Vicariate Apostolic of Wales, which became the diocese of Menevia in 1898. As a result, the see changed its name to simply the diocese of Newport. Following further reorganisation of the Catholic Church in Wales in 1916, the diocese of Newport was elevated to an ecclesiastical province and changed its name to the archdiocese of Cardiff. The archbishop has jurisdiction over the bishops of Menevia and Wrexham.
The Diocese of Menevia was merged into the Archdiocese of Cardiff, to become the Archdiocese of Cardiff-Menevia in 2024.

<doc id="1082384" wikidata="Q184500" url="?curid=1082384" title="John Scotus Eriugena">
<text>John Scotus Eriugena, also known as Johannes Scotus Erigena, John the Scot or John the Irish-born ( – c. 877), was an Irish Neoplatonist philosopher, theologian and poet of the Early Middle Ages. Bertrand Russell dubbed him &quot;the most astonishing person of the ninth century&quot;. The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; states that he &quot;is the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period. He is generally recognized to be both the outstanding philosopher (in terms of originality) of the Carolingian era and of the whole period of Latin philosophy stretching from Boethius to Anselm&quot;.

He wrote a number of works, but is best known today for having written &quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot; (&quot;The Division of Nature&quot;), or &quot;Periphyseon&quot;, which has been called the &quot;final achievement&quot; of ancient philosophy, a work which &quot;synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries&quot;. The principal concern of &quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot; is to unfold from &quot;φύσις&quot; (&quot;physis&quot;), which John defines as &quot;all things which are and which are not&quot;, the entire integrated structure of reality. Eriugena achieves this through a dialectical method elaborated through &quot;exitus&quot; and &quot;reditus&quot;, that interweaves the structure of the human mind and reality as produced by the &quot;λόγος&quot; (&quot;logos&quot;) of God.

Eriugena is generally classified as a Neoplatonist, though he was not influenced directly by such pagan philosophers as Plotinus or Iamblichus. Jean Trouillard stated that, although he was almost exclusively dependent on Christian theological texts and the Christian Canon, Eriugena &quot;reinvented the greater part of the theses of Neoplatonism&quot;.

He succeeded Alcuin of York (c. 735–804) as head of the Palace School at Aachen. He also translated and made commentaries upon the work of Pseudo Dionysius the Areopagite and was one of the few Western European philosophers of his day who knew Greek, having studied it in Ireland. A later medieval tradition recounts that Eriugena was stabbed to death by his students at Malmesbury with their pens, although this may rather be allegorical.

==Name==
The form &quot;Eriugena&quot; is used by John Scotus to describe himself in one manuscript. It means &quot;Ireland (Ériu)-born&quot;. &quot;Scottus&quot; in the Middle Ages was the Latin term for &quot;Irish or Gaelic&quot;, so his full name translates as &quot;John, the Irish-born Gael&quot;. &quot;Scotti&quot; was the late Latin term for the Irish people, with Ireland itself being Scotia (or in the Medieval period &quot;Scotia Major&quot;, to distinguish it from Scotia Minor, i.e. modern Scotland). The spelling &quot;Scottus&quot; has the authority of the early manuscripts until perhaps the 11th century. Occasionally he is also named &quot;Scottigena&quot; (&quot;Irish-born&quot;) in the manuscripts.

According to Jorge Luis Borges, John&#x27;s byname may therefore be construed as the repetitious &quot;Irish Irish&quot;.

He is not to be confused with the later, Scottish philosopher John Duns Scotus.

==Life==
Johannes Scotus Eriugena was educated in Ireland. He moved to France (about 845) at the invitation of Carolingian King Charles the Bald. He succeeded Alcuin of York (735–804), the leading scholar of the Carolingian Renaissance, as head of the Palace School. The reputation of this school increased greatly under Eriugena&#x27;s leadership, and he was treated with indulgence by the king. Whereas Alcuin was a schoolmaster rather than a philosopher, Eriugena was a noted Greek scholar, a skill which, though rare at that time in Western Europe, was used in the learning tradition of Early and Medieval Ireland, as evidenced by the use of Greek script in medieval Irish manuscripts. He remained in France for at least thirty years, and it was almost certainly during this period that he wrote his various works.

Whilst eating with King Charles the Bald, John broke wind. This was acceptable in Irish society, but not in Frankish. The King is then said to have said &quot;John, tell me, what separates a &quot;Scottus&quot; (Irishman) from a &quot;sottus&quot; (a fool)?&quot;. John replied &quot;Oh, just a table&quot;, and the king laughed.

The latter part of his life is unclear. There is a story that in 882 he was invited to Oxford by Alfred the Great, laboured there for many years, became abbot at Malmesbury, and was stabbed to death by his pupils with their &quot;styli&quot;. Whether this is to be taken literally or figuratively is not clear, and some scholars think it may refer to some other Johannes. William Turner says the tradition has no support in contemporary documents and may well have arisen from some confusion of names on the part of later historians.

He probably never left France, and the date of his death is generally given as 877. From the evidence available, it is impossible to determine whether he was a cleric or a layman; the general conditions of the time make it likely that he was a cleric and perhaps a monk.

==Theology==
Eriugena&#x27;s work is largely based upon Origen, St. Augustine of Hippo, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, St. Maximus the Confessor, and the Cappadocian Fathers. Eriugena&#x27;s overall view of reality, both human and divine, was strongly influenced by Neoplatonism. He viewed the totality of reality as a &quot;graded hierarchy&quot; cosmology of gradual declensions from the Godhead, similar to Proclus, and likewise saw in all things a dual movement of procession and reversion: that every effect remains in its cause or constitutive principle, proceeds from it, and returns to it. According to Deirdre Carabine, both &quot;ways&quot; must be understood as intrinsically entwined and are not separate movements or processes.&quot;For the procession of the creatures and the return of the same are so intimately associated in the reason which considers them that they appear to be inseparable the one from the other, and it is impossible for anyone to give any worthy and valid account of either by itself without introducing the other, that is to say, of the procession without the return and collection and vice versa.&quot; John Scotus Eriugena was also a devout Catholic. Pittenger argues that, too often, those who have written about him seem to have pictured John as one who spent his life in the endeavor to dress up his own personal Neoplatonism in a thin Christian garb, but who never quite succeeded in disguising his real tendency. &quot;This is untrue and unfair. Anyone who has taken the trouble to read Erigena, and not merely to read about him, and more particularly one who has studied the &quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot; sympathetically, cannot question the profound Christian faith and devotion of this Irish thinker nor doubt his deep love for Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God. In the middle of long and some what arid metaphysical discussions, one comes across occasional passages such as the following, surely the cry of a passionately Christian soul: &quot;O Domine Jesu, nullum aliud praemium, nullam aliam beatitudinem, nullum aliud gaudium a te postulo, nisi ut ad purum absque ullo errore fallacis theoriae verba tua, quae per tuum sanctum Spiritum inspirata sunt, intelligam&quot; (Migne ed., ioioB).&quot; The Greek Fathers were Eriugena&#x27;s favourites, especially Gregory the Theologian, and Basil the Great. Of the Latins he prized Augustine most highly. The influence of these was towards freedom and not towards restraint in theological speculation. This freedom he reconciled with his respect for the teaching authority of the Church as he understood it.

=== On the Body and Blood of the Lord ===

The first of the works attributed to Eriugena during this period was a pseudepigraphal treatise on the Eucharist, &quot;On the Body and Blood of the Lord&quot;. In it, he seems to have advanced the doctrine that the Eucharist was merely symbolical or commemorative, an opinion for which Berengar of Tours was at a later date censured and condemned at the Council of Vercelli in 1050. As a part of his penance, Berengarius is said to have been compelled to publicly burn this treatise. We now know this treatise was not written by Eriugena, but written by Ratramnus of Corbie. An English translation survives as 

=== &quot;De Divina Praedestinatione&quot; ===
Eriugena was considered orthodox by his authorities and a few years later was selected by Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, to defend the doctrine of liberty of will against the extreme predestinarianism of the monk Gottschalk (Gotteschalchus), whose view of predestination pre-figured the Calvinist position. The Catholic Church opposed Gottschalk&#x27;s position because it denied the inherent value of good works and condemned him at the Council of Quiersy 835. The treatise &quot;De Divina Praedestinatione&quot; composed for this occasion has been preserved, and it was probably from its content that Eriugena&#x27;s orthodoxy became suspect. Eriugena argues the question of predestination entirely on speculative grounds, and starts with the bold affirmation that philosophy and religion are fundamentally one and the same. Even more significant is his handling of authority and reason. Eriugena offered a brief proof that there can be predestination only for the good, for all folk are summoned to be saints.

Augustine&#x27;s view of predestination prefigured the debate as such: human beings cannot will what is good without the action of divine grace. Since they are dependent upon grace, it follows that human beings cannot save themselves; that means, some people are predestined to salvation.

Eriugena&#x27;s view, as he sets it out in this &quot;rather hastily written treatise&quot;, is that because God is simple and unchangeable, there can be nothing at all that can be predestined. Eriugena explains God&#x27;s predestination as God&#x27;s knowledge of the primordial causes. Carabine outlines Eriugena&#x27;s argument against double-predestination as follows: God cannot predestine the human will, and people are blessed or punished because of their own free will. Since the free will of human beings can be misused, sins must be the fault of individuals. Sin and evil, and the fact that some souls are damned, cannot imply a change in God or a defect in God&#x27;s power; if we accept the view of Gottschalk, God is responsible for sin and evil. Eriugena&#x27;s way out of this difficult position is based on the Neoplatonic idea that God as good is simply existence and, therefore, the opposite of non-being. Evil and sin are negations that do not, in fact, exist and cannot be caused by God.

&quot;In addition to the arguments based on the dialectical understanding of being and non-being and the unity of God&#x27;s nature, Eriugena also invokes the principles of negative theology in his answer to Gottschalk&#x27;s heresy. Foreknowledge and predestination imply temporal notions in God, who transcends time. Since God is simple and unchanging, ideas, signs, and language cannot properly signify the divine nature.&quot;

Thus, God cannot predestine any soul to damnation; rather, human sinfulness creates its own hell. This was, in brief, the case Eriugena presented to Hincmar for scrutiny. On one hand, against Gottschalk, Eriugena had followed Augustine in that the faults of the wicked and their resulting damnation are their own responsibility. But since Eriugena had denied the possibility of the predestination of the elect to eternal bliss, he had contradicted Augustine; for this reason, Hincmar ultimately rejected the treatise.

The work was warmly assailed by Drepanius Florus, canon of Lyons, and Prudentius, and was condemned by two councils: that The Council of Valence III 855, and that of Langres in 859. By the former council his arguments were described as &quot;Pultes Scotorum&quot; (&quot;Irish porridge&quot;) and (&quot;an invention of the devil&quot;).

===Translation of the &quot;Corpus Areopagiticum&quot;===
At some point in the centuries before Eriugena, a legend had developed that Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris and patron saint of the important Abbey of Saint-Denis, was the same person as both the Dionysius the Areopagite mentioned in Acts 17.34, and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a figure whose writings were not yet being circulated in the West in the ninth century. Accordingly, in the 820s ambassadors from the Byzantine emperor to the court of Louis the Pious donated to Louis a Greek manuscript of the Dionysian corpus, which was immediately given to the Abbey of Saint Denis in the care of Abbot Hilduin, who proceeded to direct a translation of the Dionysian corpus from Greek into Latin, based on this single manuscript.

Soon after, probably by the middle of the ninth century, Eriugena made a second Latin translation of the Dionysian corpus, and much later wrote a commentary on &quot;The Celestial Hierarchy&quot;. This constitutes the first major Latin reception of the Areopagite. It is unclear why Eriugena made a new translation so soon after Hilduin&#x27;s. It has often been suggested that Hilduin&#x27;s translation was deficient; though this is a possibility, it was a serviceable translation. Another possibility is that Eriugena&#x27;s creative energies and his inclination toward Greek theological subjects motivated him to make a new translation.

Eriugena&#x27;s next work was a Latin translation of Dionysius the Areopagite undertaken at the request of Charles the Bald. A translation of the Areopagite&#x27;s writings was not likely to alter the opinion already formed as to Eriugena&#x27;s orthodoxy. Pope Nicholas I was offended that the work had not been submitted for approval before being given to the world, and ordered Charles to send Eriugena to Rome, or at least to dismiss him from his court. There is no evidence, however, that this order was carried out.

At the request of the Byzantine emperor Michael III (c. 858), Eriugena undertook some translation into Latin of the works of Pseudo-Dionysius and added his own commentary. With this translation, he continued in the tradition of St. Augustine and Boethius in introducing the ideas of Neoplatonism from the Greek into the Western European intellectual tradition, where they were to have a strong influence on Christian theology.

He also translated St. Gregory of Nyssa&#x27;s &quot;De hominis opificio&quot; and St. Maximus Confessor&#x27;s &quot;Ambigua ad Iohannem&quot;.

=== &quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot; ===
==== Scope of the work ====
Eriugena&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot; (&quot;On the Division of Nature&quot;) or &quot;Periphyseon&quot;, is arranged in five books. It has been called the &quot;final achievement&quot; of ancient philosophy, a work which &quot;synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries.&quot; The form of exposition is that of a catechetical dialogue between a theologian and his pupil, and the method of reasoning is the ancient syllogistic. Nature (&quot;Natura&quot; in Latin or &quot;physis&quot; [φύσις] in Greek) is the name of the most comprehensive of all unities, that which contains within itself the most primary division of all things, that which is (being) and that which is not (nonbeing). It is presented, like Alcuin&#x27;s book, as a dialogue between Master and Pupil. Eriugena anticipates St. Thomas Aquinas, who said that one cannot know and believe a thing at the same time.

Eriugena explains that reason is necessary to understand and interpret revelation. &quot;Authority is the source of knowledge, but the reason of mankind is the norm by which all authority is judged.&quot;

Sergei N. Shushkov has challenged the dominant strains of Eriugena scholarship in pointing out these key points regarding the approach to the structure, internal progression and purpose of the &quot;De Divisione Naturae:&quot;
# Rather than the specific divisions of Nature, the modes of interpreting being and non-being are to the true constitutive subject-matter of each book of the Periphyseon (hence, of the five parts of his system, yet four divisions).
# The fourfold division of Nature is to be interpreted not as a basic structure of the system offered by Eriugena, but as a means of introducing dialectic to the body of theology through discourse and negation of St. Augustine&#x27;s specific metaphysical hierarchy, indicating the way of resolution of the cardinally theological contradiction (God does and does not create at the same time).
# Thus one should not associate Eriugena&#x27;s work with exploration of the division of God&#x27;s Nature but rather reinterpret it as an immense anti-division project to be understood as an important turn in the history of Christian thought entirely focused on the truth of God&#x27;s unity and perfection, and the lived human life assenting to it.

==== The fourfold divisions of nature ====

The Latin title refers to these four divisions of nature:

# Creating and not created. 
# Created and creating.
# Created and not creating.
# Not creating and not created.

The first is God as the ground or origin of all things; the second, Platonic ideas or forms as &quot;logoi,&quot; following St. Maximus and Augustinian exemplarism; the third, corporeal world of phenomena and formed matter world; and the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, and that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. The third division is the dialectical counterpart to the first, the fourth to the second. The inspiration of this division comes from Augustine&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot;, &quot;The cause of things, therefore which makes but is not made, is God; but all other causes both make and are made.&quot; The first and fourth divisions are to be understood of God, regarded alternately as the efficient and sustaining cause of all as dependent upon Him, and the &quot;teleological&quot; end of all: Let us then make an “analytical” or regressive collection of each of the two pairs of the four forms we have mentioned so as to bring them into a unity. The first, then, [and] fourth are one since they are understood of God [alone]. For He is the Principle of all things which have been created by Him, and the end of all things which seek Him so that in Him they may find their eternal and immutable rest. For the reason why the Cause of all things is said to create is that it is from it that the universe of those things which have been created after it (and) [by it] proceeds by a wonderful and divine multiplication into genera and species and individuals, and into differentiations and all those other features which are observed in created nature; but because it is to the same Cause that all things that proceed from it shall return when they reach their end, it is therefore called the end of all things and is said neither to create nor to be created. For once all things have returned to it nothing further will proceed from it by generation in place and time (and) genera and forms since in it all things will be at rest and will remain an indivisible and immutable One. For those things which in the processions of natures appear to be divided and partitioned into many are in the primordial causes unified and one, and to this unity they will return and in it they will eternally and immutably remain. But this fourth aspect of the universe, which, like the first also, is understood to exist in God alone, will receive a more detailed treatment in its proper place, as far as the Light of Minds shall grant (us). Now what is said of the first and fourth, that is to say, that neither the one nor the other is created since both the one and the other are Onefor both are predicated of Godwill not be obscure, I think, to any who use their intelligence aright. For that which has no cause either superior to or equal with itself is created by nothing. For the First Cause of all things is God, whom nothing precedes (nor) is anything understood (to be) in conjunction with Him which is not coessential with Him. Do you see, then, that the first and fourth forms of nature have been reduced to a unity?These divisions are not to be understood as separated and within the nature of God, but rather they are not God at all but our thought of God because we are compelled, by the very constitution of our minds, to think of a beginning and an end. The second and the third divisions, however, do not merely exist in our thought, but in things themselves and are the things in themselves, in which causes and effects are actually divided. The second division represents the primordial causes, of which the &quot;Logos&quot; is the unity and the aggregate. All that we see divided and a multiplicity in nature is one in the primal causes. The third division represents the created universe; it is all that is known in generation, in time and in space. These divisions of Nature do not mean that God is the genus of the creature, or the creature a species of God, though Gregory Nazianzen does say, &quot;pars Dei sumus&quot;, which is a metaphorical use of language, to express the truth that in God we live and move and have our being, which Eriugena himself follows. The four divisions are an example of analysis descending from the most general to the most special, and then reversing the process, and resolving individuals into species, species into genera, genera into essences, and ‘essences into the wisdom of the Deity, from where all these divisions arose and where they end.

==== Modes of non-being ====
Next in importance to the fourfold division of Nature for the understanding of Eriugena&#x27;s philosophy, is his fivefold division of non-being. It is fundamental to Erigena&#x27;s scheme that Nature, as the general name for all things, comprises both the things which are and the things which are not. All that is perceived by the senses or understood by the intellect is said to be (&quot;esse&quot;). The five modes of non-being are as follows:

# Non-being as the ineffable Godhead: All that by reason of the excellence of its nature (&quot;per excellentiam suae naturae&quot;) escapes the reach of the senses and of the intellect. The essence of all things belongs to this category. Whatever is known is a kind of accident of the underlying, unknown and unknowable substance. We know anything by quality and quantity, form, matter, difference, time and space. But the essence of it, to which these attach themselves, we cannot know. Since this essence cannot be known by us, it does not exist for us. 
# Non-being as the inaccessibility of the higher to the lower: Derived from the first mode of non-being, in the order of Nature, the affirmation of the higher existence is the denial of the lower, and the denial of the lower existence is the affirmation of the higher. Anything is, in so far as it is ‘known by itself or by what is above it; it is not, in so far as it cannot be comprehended by what is below it.
# Non-being as all latent or seminal or potential existence: All men who will ever exist were potentially created in the first man; all plants that will ever exist now exist potentially in the seed of existing plants. But in this sense, actual existence is existence, and potential existence is non-existence. 
# Non-being as that which is phenomenal and material: All that exists by generation as a form of matter in space and time, and is liable to increase and decrease. All this is not, in the full sense of being. Only what is solely comprehended by the intellect is real being. All else is appearance and not reality.
# Non-being as sin: This last mode of non-being belongs only to human nature. Man properly is in so far as he is in the image of God: in so far a he loses the image of God through sin, he is not. When is restored to him in Christ, he is again, as St. Paul the Apostle says: &quot;Who calleth the things that are not as though they were.&quot;

==== Cataphatic and apophatic theology ====
This dimension of Eriugena&#x27;s theology consists largely of his direct intellectual inheritance from Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. While the same predicate may rightly be affirmed and denied of God, the affirmation is metaphorical () yet truly indicative, the denial is literal (). This depends upon the fact that every human thought involves a contrary, and God, as the Absolute, is beyond all oppositions, for he is the reconciliation and the resolution of contraries and tensions. Therefore, for Eriugena, God may be said to be , as he is conceived to be the essence of all that is, yet strictly he is not (of which the contrary is ) because God is beyond opposition, so he is more appropriately . Similarly, he is more-than-good and more-than-goodness, more-than-eternal, and more-than-eternity. The use of phrases like these is the attempt to unite the affirmation and the negation in one statement, since the Absolute involves both the positive and the negative. But, as Eriugena sees it, every one of these attempts to express the nature of God by is really a negation. To say that God is superessential is not to say what he is, but what he is not. God indeed is beyond all words, and all thought, for he surpasses all intellect, and is better known by not knowing, and is more truly denied in all things than affirmed.

==== Theophany ====
It is therefore one of Eriugena&#x27;s fundamental tenets that it is impossible to know God as He is. We know that He is, but not what He is. He is known to be only through the things He has created, that is, He is known only by theophany, as Dionysius the Areopagite before him argued. The sense which Eriugena attaches to this phrase is not particularly clear or consistent. It seems generally to mean every manifestation of God through the medium of the creation. But it is only the devout soul that is prepared to receive the higher manifestations, and it is only to such souls that these are given. The words of Maximus are quoted as a definition of theophany in the narrower sense. &quot;As far as the human mind ascends in love, so far the divine wisdom descends in mercy.&quot; The &quot;creation&quot; of the world is in reality a &quot;theophania&quot;, or showing forth of the Essence of God in the things created. Just as He reveals Himself to the mind and the soul in higher intellectual and spiritual truth, so He reveals Himself to the senses in the created world around us. Creation is, therefore, a process of unfolding of the Divine Nature. Theophany, therefore, in this more restricted sense, is, on the part of man, an ascent to God in which every good desire and deed is a step, and on the part of God, a revelation of Himself to the human spirit in such fashion as our intelligence can understand.

==== The nature of God ====
God is (&quot;ánarkhos&quot;), that is; without beginning, uncaused, the absolutely self-sufficient, uniquely possessing &quot;aseitas&quot;. The essence of God is incomprehensible, as is the οὐσία of all that exists. But as our human intellect, which is one and invisible in itself, yet manifests itself in words and deeds, and expresses its thought in letters, and figures, so the Divine Essence, which is far above the reach of our intellect, manifests itself in the created universe. In this sense, it may even be said to be created, in those things which are made by it and through it and in it. Eriugena is fundamentally following St. Paul the Apostle here in saying that the Divine Nature is &quot;made&quot;, where the Word of God is born in the heart. So the Divine Nature may, in this strictly qualified sense, be said to create itself inasmuch as it creates from itself the nature of things.

===== Filioque =====
While God is , strictly speaking Eriugena argues, only the Father is ἄναρχος, since the Son and the Spirit have a &quot;&quot; in the Father and are generated and cospirated respectively. While Eriugena does rely on the Greeks even more so than the Western Fathers, and at times does show sympathy to Constantinople, he is a staunch defender of the theology of the filioque clause. Eriugena argues that, as the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, so the Son is born of the Father through the Holy Spirit both in the Incarnation and, in a much different sense, in baptism.

==== Intersubjectivity ====
Moran refers to the communicating intelligences (i.e., the human merged with and in God) within Eriugena&#x27;s theological schema as constituting an &quot;intersubjective&quot; domain of circular figuration which Eriugena inherits from Boethius: &quot;Eriugena does not have a modern understanding of the self-enclosed isolated subject. Rather, he has the idea of a &quot;nous&quot; which as a &#x27;circular&#x27; motion around God, and can come into a unity with Him.&quot; Likewise, Boethius’ description in the Consolation notes that the relation between Providence and Fate is as a set of concentric orbits around an axis, with Providence as the unmoved axis itself and Fate as occupying the outermost orbits, which must traverse ever longer distances around that center. For both Eriugena and Boethius, to the degree to which a soul can infuse itself with the Godhead, which is the omnipresent center, it can also be absorbed in its undivided, non-dual nature, and cease to experience the distension of being torn in multiple directions thus attaining beatitude.

Additionally, Moran argues that the notion of intersubjectivity is in Eriugena&#x27;s philosophy, and it is &quot;anti-hierarchical, bubble-like&quot;. Eriugena writes of a communion that occurs in the mind through intellectual penetration such that whenever the intellect knows something perfectly, it is &quot;made in that thing and becomes one with it.&quot; Eriugena explication of his cosmological schema reveals how the traditional hierarchy of angels placed above the human is uniquely transfigured by Christian revelation and folded through the soul&#x27;s proximity to the divine:If you look more closely into the mutual relation and unity which exist between intelligible and rational natures, you will at once find that not only is the angelic nature established in the human but also the human is established in the angelic. For it is created in everything of which the pure intellect has the most perfect knowledge and becomes one with it. So closely indeed were the human and angelic natures associated, and so they would be now if the first man had not sinned, that the two would have become one. Even as it is this is beginning to happen in the case of the highest men, from whom are the firstborn among the celestial natures. Moreover the angel is made in man, through the understanding of angel which is in man, and man is in the angel through the understanding of man which is established in the angel. For, as I have said, he who has a pure understanding is created in that which he understands. So the intelligible and rational nature of the angel is created in the intelligible and rational nature of man, just as the nature of man is created in the nature of angel, through the mutual knowledge by which angel understands man and man angel.Becoming-other through mutual embrace or absorption represents a medieval complication of the purely top-down hierarchies often representative of classical Neoplatonism. They are complicated insofar as, at one level of structure the hierarchy remains, but at another level, it is transcended and included in a wider notion of a single divine-self (i.e., network-refraction). A later medieval concordance is found with St. Thomas Aquinas, who in the thirteenth century wrote that, when a spiritual entity exists fully and completely in something, it contains that thing and is not contained by it. Gardiner notes how that is similar to Object-Orientated-Ontology, that in the relationship of knowing, a subject is brought into contact with an Other outside of the self, not in the interior of that Other, but rather in the interior of the relationship-with-that-Other-as-object.

==== Learned ignorance ====
In Eriugena&#x27;s &quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot;, the most excellent part of our nature as moving is nous, and as essence it is οὐσία. All emanation or &quot;division,&quot; and all return or &quot;analysis&quot; begins and ends in οὐσία. It is known only in this &quot;exitus-reditus&quot; process; immediately it is knowable neither generically nor in particulars. According to Wayne J. Hankey, the ambiguity that was in Boethius is absent from Eriugena, who is far more confident in his trinitarianism: οὐσία names the One, the Godhead shared between persons. The Divine &quot;nothingness by excellence&quot; is &quot;beyond all things which are and which are not&quot;. By plunging into this divine nature, which is said &quot;not to be,&quot; &quot;because of its ineffable excellence and incomprehensible infinity”, Eriugena follows Pseudo-Dionysius&#x27;s apophaticism into its extremes towards &quot;the ineffable and incomprehensible and inaccessible brilliance of the divine goodness, unknown to any intellect&quot;, and so beyond the activity of intellect. The mystical attainment of this ascent to God is through a learning of ignorance; a trained effort towards going beyond discursive thought. According to Trouillard, learned ignorance is essential to human dignity and its cosmic role:God does not know himself. And the reason for this ignorance, is that God is nothing… God… remains… inaccessible to all thought and is communicable only as motion. Therefore we distinguish in God, so to speak, two levels: that of the Deity, which is an irremediably obscure centre, and that of God the Creator, who, by the rays which he projects, makes himself known through his creatures… Our spirit is in itself a silent spontaneity and, nonetheless, manifests itself to the outside and to itself by signs and figures… Because it is in the image of God our mind is nothingness, and this is why it expresses the totality of the universe. Becoming the meanings which it emits, it creates itself in them, and nevertheless however refuses to define itself by its own creations.God is intimately woven to the human as the human is to Divinity. Eriugena came to understand human nature as more than being, &quot;that in which all things could be found,&quot; but rather became; “that in which all things are created.” The human is the workshop of creation; as the &quot;imago Dei&quot;, the human is the image of the creator. It is the medium in which God knows and creates himself out of his own unknowing nothingness, precisely because, uniquely among beings, the human possesses all the forms of knowing and ignorance, including sensation. Donald Duclow explains the indissoluble marriage between the two:Eriugena places the human being among the primordial causes within the divine Word. He further describes humanity as created in God&#x27;s image and likeness, with two basic features: (1) a self-ignorance whereby humanity knows only that it is, not what it is; and (2) a self-knowledge that embraces all creation, visible and invisible. In the first, the human being reflects God&#x27;s unknowable transcendence. In the second, the human being becomes – in Maximus&#x27;s phrase – “the workshop of all things, officina omnium,” and faithfully mirrors God&#x27;s creative Wisdom. Simultaneously transcending and embracing the whole created order, humanity thus becomes a precise image of its divine exemplar.This is why Eriugena, while being a master of the dialectic of a Greek Rationalist flavour, is able to paradoxically &quot;praise ignorance more than knowledge&quot;. It is precisely this kicking away of discursive multiplicity which can only gesture towards but never fully capture God that accords better to God:For the human mind does know itself, and again does not know itself. For it knows that it is, but does not know what it is. And as we have taught in the earlier books it is this which reveals most clearly the Image of God to be in man. For just as God is comprehensible in the sense that it can be deduced from His creation that he is, and incomprehensible because it cannot be comprehended by any intellect whether human or angelic nor even by Himself what He is, seeing that He is not a thing but is superessential: so to the human mind it is given to know one thing only, that it is – but as to what it is, no sort of notion is permitted; and, a fact which is stranger still and, to those who study God and man, more fair to contemplate, the human mind is more honoured in its ignorance than in its knowledge; for the ignorance in it of what it is is more praiseworthy than the knowledge that it is, just as the negation of God accords better with the praise of His Nature than the affirmation, and it shows greater wisdom not to know than to know that Nature of Which ignorance is the true wisdom and Which is known all the better for not being known. Therefore the Divine Likeness in the human mind is most clearly discerned when it is only known that it is, and not known what it is; and, if I may so put it, what it is, is denied in it, and only that it is, is affirmed. Nor is this unreasonable. For if it were known to be something, then at once it would be limited by some definition, and thereby would cease to be a complete expression of the Image of its Creator, Who is absolutely unlimited and contained within no definition, because He is infinite, beyond all that may be said or comprehended, superessential.

==== Alleged pantheism ====
&quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot; was condemned by a council at Sens by Honorius III (1225), for appearing to promote the identity of God and creation, and by Gregory XIII in 1585. According to Max Bernhard Weinstein, Eriugena argued on behalf of something like a panentheistic definition of nature. Lutheran theologian Otto Kirn severely criticised Weinstein, claiming sweeping generalisations and shallow assertions pertaining to Eriugena and other such Neoplatonic theologians. Eriugena maintained that for one to return to God, he must first go forth from Him and so Eriugena himself denied that he was a pantheist. Étienne Gilson also argued that Eriugena&#x27;s alleged pantheism derived from a misunderstanding of the nature of &quot;division&quot; in the Periphyseon. Gilson writes that when we read Eriugena, &quot;nature&quot; is not meant as a totality of which God and creatures are parts; or as a genus of which God and creatures would be species. God is not all things, nor are all things God and Eriugena explicitly tells us that such a conception is a monstrosity. The division of nature signifies the act by which God expresses himself in hierarchical declension, and makes himself known in a hierarchy of beings which are other than, and inferior to, him by being lesser grades of reality; &quot;yet, in point of fact, Erigena only means that each and every creature is essentially a manifestation, under the form of being, of what is above being. The &quot;esse&quot; of a being is but a light radiated by the &quot;superesse&quot;, which is God.&quot;

Historian of philosophy Frederick Copleston summarized the matter thus:
If one takes a particular set of isolated statements of John Scotus one would have to say that he was either a pantheist or a theist. For example, the statement that the distinction between the second and third stages of Nature is due only to the forms of human reasoning is in itself clearly pantheistic, while the statement that the substantial distinction between God and creatures is always preserved is clearly theistic. It might seem that we should opt for one or the other set in an unqualified manner, and it is this attitude which has given rise to the notion that John Scotus was a conscious pantheist who made verbal concessions to orthodoxy with his tongue in his cheek. But if one realises that he was a sincere Christian, who yet attempted to reconcile Christian teaching with a predominantly neo-Platonic philosophy or rather to express the Christian wisdom in the only framework of thought which was then at hand, which happened to be predominantly neo-Platonic one should also be able to realise that, in spite of the tensions involved and the tendency to rationalise Christian dogma, as far as the subjective standpoint of the philosopher [i.e., of John Scotus] was concerned a satisfactory reconciliation was effected.

==== Apocatastasis ====
Eriugena is believed to have held to a form of &quot;apocatastasis&quot; or universal reconciliation, which maintains that the universe will eventually be restored under God&#x27;s dominion. His form of &quot;apocatastasis&quot; however is fairly unique. It is not Christian Universalism, but rather part of a broader Neoplatonic eschatology. As the cosmos for Eriugena gradually unfolds the grades of reality from the Godhead, so too will the various grades enfold into each other in a cosmic return to God, of which the Incarnation of Christ is a necessary tool for such a reversion. After the resurrection, the division between the sexes shall be abolished and elevated man will be as the fall had never happened for the elect. The body of each person will return to the soul from which it was separated such that, &quot;life will become sense; sense will become reason and reason will become pure thought. A fourth stage will return the human soul to its primary cause or Idea and, together with the soul, the body it has reabsorbed...The fifth and last moment of this universal &quot;analysis&quot; will bring the terrestrial sphere back to Paradise. As this movement will propagate itself from sphere to sphere, nature and all its causes will let themselves be progressively permeated by God as air is by light. From that time and on, there will be nought else but God.&quot;

However for Eriugena, this deification does not result in annihilation, because he believes that things are more real in their primordial causes than in themselves, and as such he evades the Origenistic &quot;apocatastasis&quot; whereby the lower grades of reality are annihilated. So, while everything has indeed returned to God in Eriugena&#x27;s account, material hell is a &quot;pagan superstition&quot;, eternal punishment remains as &quot;the supernatural distinction between the chosen and the condemned will remain whole and will persist eternally, but each one will be beatified or punished in his own conscience.&quot;

==Influence==
Eriugena&#x27;s work is distinguished by the freedom of his speculation, and the boldness with which he works out his logical or dialectical system of the universe. He marks a stage of transition from ancient philosophy to the later scholasticism. For him, philosophy is not in the service of theology. His assertion that philosophy and religion are fundamentally one and the same is repeated almost word for word by many of the later scholastic writers, but its significance depends upon the selection of one or other term of the identity as fundamental or primary. For Eriugena, philosophy or reason is first or primitive; authority or religion is secondary, derived. Eriugena&#x27;s influence was greater with mystics, especially Benedictines, than with logicians, but he was responsible for a revival of philosophical thought which had remained largely dormant in western Europe after the death of Boethius.

Eriugena is generally classified as a neoplatonist, though was not influenced directly by such philosophers as Plotinus or Iamblichus. Jean Trouillard stated that, although he was almost exclusively dependent on Christian theological texts and the Christian Canon, Eriugena, &quot;reinvented the greater part of the theses of Neoplatonism.&quot;

=== St. Bernard of Clairvaux ===

Within the twelfth-century Cistercian Order, alongside William of Saint-Thierry, St. Bernard of Clairvaux&#x27;s mystical theology was greatly influenced by the work of Eriugena. His influence came to Bernard through two principal texts;

* i) Eriugena&#x27;s translation of St. Maximus the Confessor.
* ii) &quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot; itself.

From both St. Maximus and Eriugena he borrows the Dionysian concept of &quot;excessus&quot; and a milder version of Eriugena&#x27;s Neoplatonic reversion and procession but blending it further with the Johannine account of God as Love. 

=== St. Hildegard von Bingen ===

St. Hildegard&#x27;s &quot;Ordo Virtutum&quot; and &quot;Scivias&quot; express much of an influence from Eriugena. Following in the Irish theologian&#x27;s footsteps, Hildegard boldly admits the possibility of an individual who is raised above the angel, implying an intersubjective contact within the Godhead. In this unique medieval interpretation of the ontological scale, the Platonic mean serves not as a lower reflection but as a type of interface linking divine and sublunary worlds within the mind of its user. A common theme which she borrows from him also is the notion of cosmological, top-down hierarchies that both contain, and are transcended by, the human as &quot;Imago Dei&quot;. Hildegard also follows Eriugena on his account of intersubjectivity as well as his view of the soul&#x27;s return through the cosmos to God. 

=== Nicholas of Cusa ===

As Catà argues, the philosophical relationship between John Eriugena and dialectician Nicholas of Cusa, connecting directly two different thinkers through six centuries, is a fundamental moment in the history of Christian Neoplatonism. Cusanus is the most significant interpreter of Eriugena&#x27;s thought, between Eckhart and the German Idealism. &quot;The strong influence of the Irish philosopher on Cusanus’ work is decisive. The idea of God as the infinite One wherein all beings are contained; and the conception of the universe as a self-creation of God, elaborated by Eriugena, constitute the fulcrum of Cusanus’ metaphysical system.&quot;

=== Modern philosophy ===
Leszek Kołakowski, a Polish Marx scholar, has mentioned Eriugena as one of the primary influences on Hegel&#x27;s, and therefore Marx&#x27;s, dialectical form. In particular, he called &quot;De Divisione Naturae&quot; a prototype of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;. Eriugena&#x27;s systematic earned the reputation as the &quot;Hegel of the ninth century,&quot; among German Hegelian scholars.

==Legacy==

Eriugena gives his name to the John Scottus School in Dublin. John Scotus also appeared on the Series B £5 note, in use between 1976 and 1992.

Bertrand Russell called him &quot;the most astonishing person of the ninth century&quot;. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states he &quot;is the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period. He is generally recognized to be both the outstanding philosopher (in terms of originality) of the Carolingian era and of the whole period of Latin philosophy stretching from Boethius to Anselm&quot;.

===William of Malmesbury===
William of Malmesbury&#x27;s humorous anecdote illustrates both the character of Eriugena and the position he occupied at the French court. The king having asked, (What separates a sot [drunkard] from an Irishman?), Eriugena replied, (&quot;Only a Table&quot;).

William of Malmesbury is not considered a reliable source on John Scotus Eriugena by modern scholars. For example, his reports that Eriugena is buried at Malmesbury is doubted by scholars who say that William confused John Eriugena with a different monk named John. William&#x27;s report on the manner of Eriugena&#x27;s death, killed by the pens of his students, also appears to be a legend. &quot;It seems certain that this is due to confusion with another John and that the manner of John&#x27;s death is borrowed from the Acts of St. Cassian of Imola. Feast: (at Malmesbury), 28 January.&quot;

<text>Ernie Reyes Jr. (born January 15, 1972) is an American actor and martial artist, known for his acting work in films such as &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;, &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (1985), as Donatello&#x27;s stuntman in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1990), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot; (1991), &quot;Surf Ninjas&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Rundown&quot; (2003). He has also done stunt work in films such as &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, as well as motion capture stunts in films such as &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. His TV work includes season 3 episode 4 of &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, dramas such as the short-lived &quot;Sidekicks&quot; (in which he co-starred with Gil Gerard), and &quot;&quot; and reality TV series such as &quot;Final Fu&quot;.

==Early life==
Reyes was born in San Jose, California, to actor/stuntman Ernie Reyes Sr. and is the grandson of Filipino immigrants. He has three brothers and two sisters, one of whom, Lee, is a boxer and another, Santino Ramos, is a filmmaker/artist. By age 6, Reyes had joined his father&#x27;s West Coast Demo Team.

==Career==
Reyes made his film debut at age 13 in the 1985 film &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;. The same year he shared the screen with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brigitte Nielsen in &quot;Red Sonja&quot;. During this time, he also had his own television series, &quot;Sidekicks&quot;, a spin-off of the original Walt Disney one-time special &quot;The Last Electric Knight&quot;, alongside Gil Gerard presented by Michael Eisner. He also appeared in an episode of the hit television series &quot;MacGyver&quot; in 1988. Reyes had starring roles in &quot;Surf Ninjas&quot;, and notably as Keno, the pizza delivery boy, in the second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, &quot;The Secret of the Ooze&quot;. He also served as the martial arts stunt double for Donatello in the first &quot;Ninja Turtles&quot; film. He later appeared in films such as &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; playing Zing and in &quot;The Rundown&quot; alongside WWE wrestler Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson. Reyes guest starred in three episodes of the TV series &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot; alongside David Carradine.

In 2006, Reyes hosted the MTV martial arts reality show &quot;Final Fu&quot;.

Reyes has a professional fight record of 3–0 in Strikeforce which was a large mixed martial arts organization but started out as a Muay Thai and kickboxing organization. Ernie fought Anthony Elkaim the WKA ISKA Champion. Reyes knocked out the champion in the 3rd round. His next two fights would be won by decision, including a unanimous decision over Veasna Thach, which aired on ESPN. Ernie Reyes Jr.&#x27;s fight against the champion Anthony Elkaim also aired on ESPN.

Reyes has done motion capture stunts for blockbuster films such as &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. He also played a cemetery warrior in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; who gets killed by his own poison dart. Reyes guest starred on &quot;&quot; &quot;The Frozen Lake&quot; and “Expiration Date” playing &quot;Jay Thapa&quot;, a Nepalese soldier who is an expert in knife-fighting.

==Personal life==

In June 2015, it was reported that Reyes was suffering from kidney failure and was in need of a transplant. According to his sister, Reyes undergoes dialysis three times per week for four hours each day. His family set up a GoFundMe campaign to help raise $75,000 for his medical expenses. In August 2022, Reyes revealed that the transplant had been successful and that he was healthy.

Reyes married his wife Lisa in 2009. They have two children, Lotus Blossom and Phoenix.

<text>The Bishop of Menevia was the ordinary of the Diocese of Menevia in the Province of Cardiff in the Catholic Church in Wales.

The Diocese of Menevia covered an area of roughly consisting of Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire, the City and County of Swansea and the ancient counties of Brecknockshire and Radnorshire. The see was in Swansea, where the seat was located at Saint Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral.

The Vicariate Apostolic of Wales was elevated to diocese status on 12 May 1898. The present territory of the Diocese dates from the restructuring of the Province of Cardiff by Pope John Paul II on 12 February 1987. The seat of Bishop was vacant following the retirement of Rt. Reverend Thomas Burns, S.M. in July 2019. The Diocese was overseen by the Apostolic Administrator The Most Reverend Archbishop George Stack of the Archdiocese of Cardiff. Following Stack&#x27;s retirement in 2022, Pope Francis appointed Bishop Mark O’Toole as metropolitan archbishop of Cardiff and bishop of Menevia, Wales, uniting the two sees &quot;in persona Episcopi&quot;.

The estimated Catholic population of the Diocese was 26,266 out of a total population of 788,550 (3.3%).

The diocese was merged in 2024 into the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cardiff-Menevia.

<doc id="1082394" wikidata="Q8099087" url="?curid=1082394" title="Cycle ball">
<text>Cycle-ball, also known as &quot;radball&quot; (from German), is a sport similar to association football played on bicycles. The two people on each team ride a fixed gear bicycle with no brakes or freewheel. The ball is controlled by the bike and the head, except when defending the goal.

==History==
The sport was introduced in 1883 by American artistic cyclist, Nicholas Edward Kaufmann. The first match was played on September 14 that year between Kaufmann and fellow artistic cyclist John Featherly. Its first world championships were in 1929. In the early 20th century, the sport spread to Germany; in the modern day, Germany is the location of the sport&#x27;s largest fanbase. Cycle-ball is also popular in Austria, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. The most successful players were the Pospíšil brothers of Czechoslovakia, world champions 20 times between 1965 and 1988.

Closely related is artistic cycling in which the athletes perform a kind of gymnastics on cycles.

== Rules ==
The game is played by two teams of two players in a field of 11 meters length by 9 meters width.

==Championships==
*UCI Indoor Cycling World Championships since 1930 (Men) / 2023 (Women) / Artistic since 1956/1959 / Pair 1986 / Quartets 2003
*Cycle-ball at the 2005 and 2007 Asian Indoor Games
*Cycle-ball at the 1989 World Games
*European Cycleball Championship since 1967
*15th Asian Indoor Indoor Cycling Championships in Hong Kong 2024

<text>Oberpfaffenhofen is a village that is part of the municipality of Weßling in the district of Starnberg, Bavaria, Germany. It is located about from the city center of Munich.

==Village==
The village is home to the Oberpfaffenhofen Airport and a major site of the German Aerospace Center (&quot;Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt&quot;, DLR). In 1983, the first West-German astronaut, the physicist Ulf Merbold, flew to space on board a Space Shuttle in a Spacelab mission that was partly supervised by the German Space Operations Center located at Oberpfaffenhofen.

The research center in Oberpfaffenhofen houses the DLR, including the Columbus Control Center which DLR operates for the European Space Agency and Airbus Defence and Space, and also some Fraunhofer Institutes and other scientific institutes. From 2014, OHB group moved the division which formerly was Kayser-Threde, from Munich to Oberpfaffenhofen.

Also situated in Oberpfaffenhofen is the industrial area of (the now insolvent) Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH (later part of Fairchild Dornier). The aircraft manufacturer shared the airfield with the DLR.

During the occupation of Germany the airport was designated Oberpfaffenhofen Air Force Depot which also served as the maintenance depot for the aircraft that were utilized during the Berlin Airlift of 1948–49.

<text>The Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh is the ordinary of the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh. The archdiocese covers an area of 5,504 km2. The metropolitan see is in the City of Edinburgh where the archbishop&#x27;s seat (&quot;cathedra&quot;) is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Mary. The eighth and current archbishop is Leo Cushley.

== History ==
After the Scottish Reformation, the Catholic Church abandoned the hierarchy and for nearly a century Catholics in Scotland were under the jurisdiction of the English prefects and vicars apostolic. In 1653, the Prefecture Apostolic of Scotland was established, which was elevated to the Vicariate Apostolic in 1694. On 23 July 1727, Scotland was divided into the Vicariates Apostolic of the Lowland District and the Highland District, each headed by a vicar apostolic. On 13 February 1827, Scotland was divided again into three vicariates apostolic; the Eastern District (formerly the Lowland District), the Northern District (formerly the Highland District), and the Western District (created from parts of the other two districts). On the restoration of the Scottish hierarchy by Pope Leo XIII on 15 March 1878, part of the Eastern District was elevated to the status of a metropolitan archdiocese with the title St Andrews and Edinburgh.

<text>The Game Boy Sound System (GBS) is a file format containing Nintendo Game Boy sound driver data designed for the Game Boy sound hardware.

GBS rips are an arduous task often involving debuggers and compiled assembly code, as there was no uniform sound driver for each Game Boy game. As a result, GBS players and the files themselves emulate just enough of the original hardware and ROM data to play back the music driver and data.

==Players==
*Kobarin Media Player - Includes a front end, supports GBS and many chiptune formats natively, has a Winamp plugin converter.
*Audacious - *nix player that accepts GBS.
*Chipamp - Winamp plug-in bundle compiled by OverClocked ReMix allowing playback of over 40 chiptune and tracker formats
*gbsplay - Open source player (Linux, *nix) (and XMMS plugin in older versions)
*NEZPlug++ - Winamp plug-in that currently supports the most up-to-date implementation of the GBS format. 
*Audio Overload - A media player capable of playing a variety of audio formats from vintage consoles and computers.

<text>The coat of arms of Victoria is the official heraldic symbol of the Australian state of Victoria. Victoria was the second state of Australia to gain arms, granted on 6 June 1910 by royal warrant of King George V. The state had been named in 1851 after his grandmother, who reigned at the time. The current version of the arms was granted 28 March 1978 in the royal warrant issued by Queen Elizabeth II.

== Description ==
The shield of arms shows a blue (azure) field with five argent stars (one of eight points, two of seven points, one of six points and one of five points) arranged to represent the Crux Australis.

The helm facing to the left is situated above the shield and is bearing the torse and originates from the frequent illustrations of early arms incorporating a helmet. This helmet is referred to as a closed or tilting helm, which was used by knights in the Late Medieval and Renaissance eras.
The mantling or lambrequin that surrounds the helmet has two sides, one of colour and the other of a metal. The tinctures are correspondent to the colours of the shield of arms, being azure (blue) and argent (silver).

The crest is a kangaroo holding St Edward&#x27;s Crown, on a wreath or torse of azure (blue) and silver, which are the official colours of the state. The wreath is situated on top of the helmet, with both the kangaroo and the helmet facing the left side of the shield.

The supporters are derived from their function of supporting the shield on either side. While the supporters of other Australian states&#x27; coat of arms are generally animals, they are human figures. The figure on the left, dexter, wears a laurel wreath crown along with a silver gown and an azure stole whilst holding a branch of olive. The action of her carrying an olive branch in her exterior hand, represents &quot;Peace&quot;. The figure corresponding, sinister wears a chaplet of corn along with a silver gown and gules stole whist grasping onto a cornucopia. The action of her supporting a cornucopia with her exterior hand represents &quot;Prosperity&quot;.

The motto &quot;Peace and Prosperity&quot; is represented by the supporters on both sides of the shield. This motto is also the first to be in English amongst the coats of arms of Australia. With dexter, figure on the left representing &quot;Peace&quot; and sinister, figure on the right representing &quot;Prosperity&quot;.

The compartment consists of the pink form of the common heath (&quot;Epacris impressa&quot; Labill), &quot;pink heath&quot; which is situated on a grassy mound. This provides base for both the supporters and the shield.

=== Blazon ===
The first arms authorised by King George V on 6 June 1910 included a formal description, or blazon of the arms. This was as follows:

* Arms: &quot;&quot;Azure, five Stars Argent representing the Constellation of the Southern Cross.&quot;
* Crest: &quot;On a Wreath of the Colours, Argent and Azure, a demi-Kangaroo proper holding in the paws an Imperial Crown Or.&quot;
* Supporters: &quot;Dexter, a Female Figure (representing Peace) proper vested Argent cloaked Azure wreathed round the temples with a Chaplet and holding in the exterior hand a branch of Olive also proper; and Sinister, a like figure (representing Prosperity) vested Argent cloaked Gules wreathed round the temples with a Chaplet of Corn and supporting with the exterior hand a Cornucopia proper.&quot;
* Motto: &quot;Peace and Prosperity&quot;&quot;

== Symbolism ==
The Crux Australis, more commonly known as the Southern Cross is considered to be Australia&#x27;s oldest symbol. Although the Southern Cross has had many different meanings, the symbol has been used since 1823 to represent Australia. The symbol is found on the Australian national flag. One of the designers of the flag, Ivor William Evans at age 14, intended for the Southern Cross to represent the four cardinal values by Dante: prudence, temperance, justice and fortitude. This constellation of five stars can only be seen within the southern hemisphere, uniting Australians under the same sky.

Supposedly deriving from the customs of ancient Greece, the olive branch held upon by Dexter is a symbol of peace. This symbol is coupled by the word &quot;Peace&quot;, hence together symbolising peace.

The cornucopia represents the abundance and nourishment that was provided to the ancient Greek god, Zeus, the king of gods during his infant years. This symbol consists of a goat&#x27;s horn overflowing with an abundant supply of nourishment. Half of the motto, &quot;Prosperity&quot; is represented through Sinister supporting the horn of plenty.

The symbolic languages of flora such as pink heath was originally a reflection of the Enlightenment&#x27;s interests in astronomy and natural history. During the meeting of representatives of Victorian government departments, societies, and individuals in 1951, it was declared that the pink heath be adopted as the official floral emblem for the state of Victoria. The desire for the flower to represent the state is a part of colonial habit of deference. Governor Dallas Brooks had made the proclamation 12 November 1958. This was as follows:
The Victorian coat of arms is composed of colours that correspond to those used in the Victorian State tartan. Historically, tartans were used as an everyday garb which eventually developed into a symbol of clan kinship. The Victorian State tartan is an emblem that officially represents the state. The tartan was designed after the arms by Betty Johnson in November 1998. The colours of the tartan include blue, white, green, and pink. Each of these colours was designed to represent an element of the arms. Blue represents the colour of the shield. White represents stars on the Southern Cross. Green represents the olive branch and pink represents the pink heath. These colours together represent Victoria.

== Development and change ==

The creation and development request for the Victorian coat of arms to be made begun in late 1909, following the creation of the coat of arms of Australia in 1908. The Victorian Government requested elements of the state badge that was used in Victoria since 1877 to be incorporated into the arms. These elements consisted of a Southern Cross and an Imperial Crown. Without much difficulty all elements of the state badge were implemented, and the design had been approved by the 23rd premier of Victoria, John Murray, by February 1910.

By 6 June 1910, King George V had signed a royal warrant granting the state of Victoria an armorial identification. This version had remained the formal symbol of Victoria until 1973.

The coat of arms of Victoria (Australia) had undergone some reinterpretation and modification before obtaining its finalised version.

The former coat of arms granted by royal warrant of King George V did not include a compartment. It was only until 11 November 1958 when the pink form of the common heath became the proclaimed floral emblem of Victoria, the desire of this flower to be included in the armorial bearing rose.

Meeting the desires of adding the formally proclaimed floral emblem of Victoria, Queen Elizabeth II had issued a royal warrant on 28 March 1973. This royal warrant had added the pink heath along with a grassy mound compartment to provide a base for the supporters and the flower. Although the new armorial bearing had slight modifications, the majority had remained the same. However, with the new armorial bearing being implemented, this had given the opportunity for some elements of the bearing to be reinterpreted.

The depictions of the crown held by the demi-kangaroo have varied throughout the years, in accordance with the different monarchs&#x27; that were in reign at the time. Prior to the reign of Elizabeth II in 1953, the Tudor Crown or the Imperial Crown was officially used widely as a symbol in heraldry within the Commonwealth realms and the United Kingdom. However, Elizabeth preferred the St Edward&#x27;s Crown and this preference was implemented in 1974. The same warrant that added the pink heath and the compartment, had also reinterpreted the previously known Tudor Crown to St Edward&#x27;s Crown.

== Legal status ==
The Victorian coat of arms is the formal symbol of Victoria, being &quot;the most prestigious branding devices available to the Victorian Government and agencies&quot;.
The coat of arms is never to be used without permission, restrictions are in place for their use and reproduction. Commercial use and advertising purposes including the use of the Victorian Government Insignia is not permitted. Victoria is the only state or territory to have specific legislation for its coat of arms which allows action of prosecuting an offender if the coat of arms is used without permission.

The unauthorised use of the arms is subjected to penalty under the Unauthorised Documents Act 1958.

For the use of the arms, formal requests must be submitted, addressing the executive director, Strategic Communication, Engagement and Protocol Branch and Department of Premier and Cabinet through writing. This will only be submitted and emailed to the Department of Premier and Cabinet for processing.

<text>The Maniototo Plain, usually simply known as The Maniototo, is an elevated inland region in Otago, New Zealand. The region roughly surrounds the upper reaches of the Taieri River and the Manuherikia River. It is bounded by the Kakanui Range to the north and the Rock and Pillar Range to the southeast. It has a harsh, dry climate, ranging from over 30 °C in mid-summer to -15 °C in mid-winter.

The region is sparsely populated, with the largest centres being Ranfurly, Naseby, Wedderburn and Oturehua.

Part of the Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands the land surrounding the plain is hilly, with many outcrops of rock which also break up the plain in places.

During the 1860s the region was one of the sites of the Otago gold rush, and relics from that era can still be seen around the towns of Kyeburn, Naseby, and St. Bathans.

Sheep farming is the major source of income. The area is closely associated with the sport of curling. Naseby has the only indoor curling rink and the only natural luge track in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Demographics==
The Maniototo statistical area covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Maniototo had a population of 1,635 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 81 people (5.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 69 people (4.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 693 households, comprising 837 males and 798 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.05 males per female. The median age was 48.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 279 people (17.1%) aged under 15 years, 228 (13.9%) aged 15 to 29, 726 (44.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 399 (24.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 90.8% European/Pākehā, 9.5% Māori, 0.7% Pasifika, 5.0% Asian, and 1.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 11.9, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 42.0% had no religion, 49.5% were Christian, 0.2% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.2% were Hindu and 0.9% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 177 (13.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 327 (24.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $29,100, compared with $31,800 nationally. 150 people (11.1%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 678 (50.0%) people were employed full-time, 225 (16.6%) were part-time, and 18 (1.3%) were unemployed.

== Maniototo County Council ==
Maniototo County Council existed between June 1877 and October 1989, when it became part of the Central Otago District Council. It was larger than the statistical area, at and included the ridings of Mount Ida (Naseby), Hyde, St Bathans, Serpentine, Kyeburn, Puketoi and Idaburn. The county offices were moved from Naseby to Ranfurly in 1936.

==Name==
The original Māori name for the area is &quot;Māniatoto&quot;, &#x27;plains of blood&#x27;, which either referred to the red tussock that covers the landscape or to old battles.

Early Pākehā settlers knew the area as Napiers Plain after Peter Napier, who purchased a run there in the 1850s.

&#x27;Maniatoto&#x27; was the official name adopted by the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand in 1928, but the county council preferred &#x27;Maniototo&#x27;, possibly because it had already installed a large sign with that spelling. 

While the New Zealand Geographic Board reaffirmed the Maniatoto spelling in 1948, it changed the official name to &quot;Maniototo&quot; in 1954 due to &quot;long and accepted usage&quot;.

In late May 2024, the Central Otago District Council (CODC) rejected a motion to rename Maniototo Community Board to its correct Māori name Māniatoto. While the CODC acknowledged the error, the majority of councillors voted against the name change since it was not supported by the community board. According to board member and Councillor Stu Duncan, 90% of the community opposed the name change. Mayor of Central Otago Tim Cadogan was the only member of the Council to support the name change.

== Environment ==

The Maniototo plains are home to an array of native New Zealand wildlife and plants. The Otekake Conservation Park managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation can be found at the northern end of the plains.

The Upper Taieri River flows through the Maniototo plains and is one of the only scroll plains in the Southern Hemisphere. The scroll plain works its way across the Maniototo and once flowed into an oxbow lake near the township of Kokonga. The lake was drained through agricultural practices. Today, there is much work underway through an initiative called &quot;Tiaki Maniototo&quot; the local community, farmers and business to restore the scroll plain and enrich the biodiversity that can be found here.

The Maniototo is home to native species of New Zealand freshwater fish known as Galaxias. Rare Roundhead Galaxias (Galaxias anomalus) and Flathead Galaxias (Galaxias depressiceps) can be found in many creeks, streams and rivers across the plains and there is much work underway to protect their habitats from damage and introduced species such as trout. Some rare species of Galaxias are only found on the Maniototo.

== In popular culture ==
In the novel &quot;Living in the Maniototo&quot; by Janet Frame, the region acts as a metaphor for the &#x27;bloody plain&#x27; of the human imagination.

The scenery between Omakau and Ranfurly appeared in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy as the location for many of the scenes set in Rohan.

The cast and crew of the Jane Campion film The Power of the Dog which stars Benedict Cumberbatch stayed in Naseby while filming in the Ida Valley in the Maniototo.

<text>Liverpool Road is a street in Islington, North London. It covers a distance of between Islington High Street and Holloway Road, running roughly parallel to Upper Street through the area of Barnsbury. It contains several attractive terraces of Georgian houses and Victorian villas, many of which are listed buildings. There are a number of pubs, small businesses and restaurants along its route, as well as some secluded garden squares. The vast majority of the street is residential, with a bustling shopping and business area at the southern, Angel, end.

==History==

Liverpool Road was formerly named the &quot;Back Road&quot;, one of a trio of roads with Upper Street and Lower Street (later renamed Essex Road) meeting at the Angel Inn.
By the late 16th century the Back Road ran mostly through open country from Holloway Road at a point named Ring Cross to the High Street in Islington village. It bypassed Upper Street and connected with lanes across the western part of the parish. The Back Road was primarily a drovers&#x27; road where cattle would be rested before the final leg of their journey to Smithfield Livestock Market. Pens and sheds known as layers or lairs were erected along the road to accommodate the animals.

Around 1761, a turnpike tollgate was erected just beyond the Angel Inn at the entrance to Islington village at the end of White Lion Street. It was moved in about 1800 nearer to Liverpool Road, but proving a cause of accidents because of a sharp turn, in 1808 it was moved again to a final position midway between the two sites. In 1766, an Act of Parliament fixed a site for a tollgate at the northern end of Liverpool Road at the junction with Holloway Road.

Suburban development began to the south of Holloway Road around the late 1760s with the construction of Paradise Row at the northern end of Liverpool Road.

During the period after the Napoleonic Wars, a rapid rise in population put a premium on building land contiguous to London. Starting in the 1820s, plots in Barnsbury were sold on building leases and a flood of speculative building followed.

The developments along Liverpool Road were mostly on fields belonging to different owners, leading to a remarkable number of subsidiary names, including:
* Bride, Anns, Barford, Manchester, Park, Barnsbury, Barnsbury Park, King Edward, Wellington, Strahan, Cloudesley, Elizabeth, Felix, Liverpool and Paradise Terraces
*Felix, Seymour, Morgans, Park, Chapel and Trinidad Places; Park Place West
*Albion, Felix, Oldfield and Lowther Cottages
*Barnsbury and Albion Villas
*Paradise and Mount Rows
* Nowells Buildings
The Back Road became known as Liverpool Road in 1826, taking its name from the Tory Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, known for his repressive measures to maintain order after the Peterloo Massacre of 1819. The name change was formalised in 1868 when the Vestry decided that &quot;the Liverpool Road be so called from the Upper Street to Holloway Road and the houses re-numbered alternately&quot;. Many of the subsidiary names continued to be used for years afterwards.

The house building developments were originally planned for the &quot;comfortably off&quot;, wanting to move from congested central London to the more rural suburb of Islington. However, from the 1850s the new railways tempted suburban dwellers to more distant and still countrified areas. Barnsbury was gradually abandoned by the prosperous, and its houses turned into tenements and flats with absentee landlords. The 1860s saw an influx of clerks, schoolmasters, printers, jewellers, milliners, dressmakers, servants and bricklayers. Censuses show house occupancy changing from single households with a servant, to multiple household occupancy, although Charles Booth&#x27;s poverty map of c.1890 still shows most Liverpool Road households as &quot;Fairly comfortable. Good ordinary earnings&quot;. In the first half of the 20th century the street, as with much of Islington and its population, became impoverished.

Liverpool Road suffered damage from high explosives during the Second World War, including:
*Nos. 309/311/313 Liverpool Road took a direct hit during a bombing raid on the night of 19 October 1940 and were completely destroyed. The present Wynn Court was later built on the site.
*St Mary Magdalene school and the surrounding area were destroyed by a bomb on 7/8 October 1940.
*Granary Square 1940/41
*London Fever Hospital
*On 6 December 1944 a V-2 rocket landed close to Liverpool Road at the junction of Mackenzie and Chalfont Roads, on the site of the present Paradise Park. The Prince of Wales pub was devastated, killing 68 and injuring 99 people, in the worst V-2 attack on Islington.

After the Second World War much housing in Islington was chronically neglected and damaged, and was taken into local authority ownership. Many older properties were demolished and replaced with council housing, including in Liverpool Road.

Starting about 1960 middle class and professional householders began returning to Islington, to houses which were once elegant but now, more often than not, were endowed with Victorian plumbing hardly suited for modern living. Journalists, architects, lawyers, accountants, teachers and designers were attracted by the style and size of the Regency and Victorian houses and squares and the opportunity to acquire large, characterful properties at prices they could afford, with easy access to the City of London, Westminster and the West End. Consequently, house values soon soared, a trend which has continued to the present.

Liverpool Road today houses a diverse community of different ethnicities and varying levels of income, occupying a mixture of houses and flats, which are owned or rented, both privately and as social housing.

==Famous residents==
No. 379 Liverpool Road was the residence of Robert Seymour, known for his caricatures and for his illustrations for &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; by Charles Dickens. In 1836 he had several disagreements with Dickens over the illustrations for &quot;Pickwick&quot;, and may also have been depressed about his finances and career. In the early hours of 20 April, he walked out into the summer-house in the garden behind his home (then named 16 Park Place West) and wrote a farewell to his &quot;Best and dearest of wives&quot;, blaming only his &quot;own weakness and infirmity&quot;. He set up his fowling piece (shotgun) with a string on its trigger, and shot himself dead. 

A commemorative plaque at no. 60 Liverpool Road marks a top floor studio where Derek Jarman, English film director, gay rights activist and author lived between 1967 and 1969. It was here he worked on artwork and costumes for Sadler’s Wells Opera’s production of Don Giovanni in 1968.

No. 533 Liverpool Road displays a blue plaque unveiled by the Huguenot Society in 2017, commemorating the British artist Peter Paillou, best known for his paintings of birds. The terrace was built in 1766 as Paradise Row, and Paillou lived in the house between 1776 and 1780.

Other residents have included:

*Jenny Logan (1942- ), actress, most familiar as the &quot;Shake n&#x27; Vac&quot; lady, lived at no. 323
*Anton Rodgers (1933-2007), actor, lived at no. 323
*Jane Tryphoena Stephens (1812?-1896), actress, kept a tobacconist’s shop at no. 39 before taking to the stage in 1840
*Laurence Edmondson (1986-present), Formula 1 Journalist, owns a flat, which he uses when not travelling with the F1 grand prix circuit.

==Places of interest==

===Chapel Market and Angel Central===

At its southern, Angel end, Liverpool Road parts from Islington High Street at the former Pied Bull pub. Moving northwards, the street passes Chapel Market, Angel Central shopping centre, and other shops and supermarkets until reaching Tolpuddle Street.
From there onwards, the remaining 90% of the length of the street is primarily residential, with a few small businesses.

=== Royal Agricultural Hall ===
The Royal Agricultural Hall (originally named the Agricultural Hall) was the primary exhibition site for London until the Second World War and the largest building of its kind, holding up to 50,000 people.

It was built in 1862 by the Smithfield Club on the site of William Dixon&#x27;s cattle lairs, at a cost of £32,000. The construction was inspired by the Crystal Palace, which had been designed for the Great Exhibition of 1851. The original purpose of the Agricultural Hall and its location were related specifically to its proximity to Smithfield, the great livestock market, and took advantage of Liverpool Road’s function as a cattle route. The hall was 75 ft high and the arched glass roof spanned 125 ft. It was built for the first annual Smithfield Show in December 1862 but was subsequently popular for other purposes, including recitals and the Royal Tournament. The most glamorous event to take place was the Grand Ball held for the Belgian Volunteer regiments during their visit to England in July 1867. Other events at the &quot;Aggie&quot; included military tournaments, walking matches, missionary exhibitions, musical recitals, dairy shows, balls, mule and donkey shows, revivalist meetings, circuses, dog shows, motorcycle and cycle shows, trade fairs, and in 1870 a bullfight. In 1884 the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; was added because of the number of visits by Queen Victoria and members of the Royal Family. 

In 1943, after the nearby Mount Pleasant sorting office was bombed, the building was requisitioned for use during World War II and never re-opened to the public. It continued as a sorting office until 1971, then lay empty and deteriorating until eventually the main hall was redeveloped as the Business Design Centre in the 1980s. The remainder of the building was demolished and the main entrance moved from Liverpool Road to the Upper Street side.

The Royal Agricultural Hall features as the location for a Victorian walking match in Peter Lovesey&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Wobble to Death&quot;, and its BBC Radio&#x27;s Saturday Night Theatre adaptation.

Liverpool Road is unusual in being one of the few streets in London to have a &quot;high pavement&quot;. This was constructed in the 1860s to protect pedestrians from being splashed by the large numbers of animals using the road to reach the then-new Agricultural Hall. As a consequence, the pavement is approximately above the road surface for some lengths of the street.

=== London Fever Hospital ===
Old Royal Free Place and Old Royal Free Square were originally the London Fever Hospital, and then from 1948 an annexe to the Royal Free Hospital. 
The London Fever Hospital moved to Kettle Field on Liverpool Road in 1848 from its earlier premises at King&#x27;s Cross when the site was needed as part of the site for the Great Northern Railway terminus at King&#x27;s Cross Station. Despite much local opposition, Liverpool Road was believed to be a much better position for a fever hospital because it was on the top of a gravel ridge, high and well drained, and thought likely to be free of the miasma, or bad air, held to cause disease.

The architect for the new hospital was Charles Fowler, who received the commission due to the influence of the Earl of Devon. The circumstances caused some controversy: a competition had been held to choose a design, and one by David Mocatta had been formally decided upon by the committee, but it was set aside and Fowler was brought in to carry out the work. Fowler designed the red-brick, colonnaded façade in Palladian style, with two wings. The front façade consisted of the front elevation with three blocks linked by single-storey colonnades very much as seen today. The central block and colonnades were intended to house offices, stores and the committee room. The Victorians used this design to disguise the wards of typhoid and scarlet fever patients, who were admitted from 1849. Behind were two flanking blocks which were occupied by &#x27;superior class wards&#x27;, incorporating the latest ideas of the time for healthy nursing.

In 1862 Charles Dickens described the hospital as &quot;not only the single hospital of its kind in London but probably the best hospital of its kind in Europe&quot;.

The hospital suffered bomb damage during World War II, became part of the Royal Free in 1948, and eventually closed in 1975. From 1990 the surviving buildings were converted to residential use.

===Holy Trinity Church===

Islington is known for its large (about 30) number of garden squares, and Liverpool Road’s route is near to several, including Cloudesley, Gibson, Milner, Lonsdale, Barnsbury, and Arundel Squares. The squares mostly date to the early 19th century when they were included in building plans as an attractive and fashionable amenity to justify charging higher rents from wealthier occupants of the surrounding houses. Cloudesley Square is accessed between nos. 141 and 143 Liverpool Road, from where Holy Trinity Church is visible.

Cloudesley Square was the earliest Barnsbury square to be built, in 1826–9. The centre is occupied by Holy Trinity Church, which was designed by the young Charles Barry in the newly fashionable Perpendicular style and recognisably copying King’s College Chapel, Cambridge. A handsome painted window commemorates Richard Cloudesley who died in 1517 and bequeathed to the parish the piece of ground called the &quot;Stony Field&quot; (hence nearby Stonefield Street) upon which the church is built, asking that thirty requiem masses a year should be said for the repose of his soul forever. He bequeathed in his will an allowance of straw for the prisoners of Newgate, King&#x27;s Bench, Marshalsea prisons and the mad inmates of Bedlam, gowns valued at 6s 8d each for the poor and a number of bequests. These are still administered by the Cloudesley charity. 

The church was declared redundant in the 1960s and remained empty until 1980 when it was leased by a Nigerian Pentecostal community, the Celestial Church of Christ. Possession was returned to the Diocese of London in 2018.

=== Islington workhouse ===
Islington workhouse was formerly located off Liverpool Road. A workhouse had been operating at nearby locations since 1729, until the first purpose-built building was constructed in 1777 in spacious grounds off the passage then known as &quot;Cut Throat Lane&quot;, now the west range of Barnsbury Street, at the junction with Liverpool Road. It ceased to be a workhouse in 1872 and the buildings were demolished and a new block erected at the south-east of the site as the district relieving offices, labour bureau and smallpox vaccination centre. No. 281 Liverpool Road, the curious asymmetrical turreted building of 1872 at the corner, was used until 1969 as the Registrar’s Office for Births, Deaths and Marriages. All the surviving buildings have now been converted to residential use.

The original Liverpool Road route passed along the present Lonsdale Place, off Barnsbury Street. Topographer Samuel Lewis wrote in 1842 that &quot;the course of [Liverpool] road, which once passed in a direct line from the south to the front of the workhouse, and thence turned, easterly, to the top of Barnesbury-street, was changed into its present route in 1796; and by this alteration two dangerous angles, the cause of frequent accidents, were removed&quot;.

===College Cross===

Between nos. 220 and 222 Liverpool Road, a short road leads into College Cross. Here the Church Missionary College stood from 1825 to 1915 on the site of the present Sutton Dwellings. The college was built by the Church Missionary Society on the site of a large 18th century botanic garden. 

===Thomas Cubitt houses===

Nos. 230-254 Liverpool Road, part of the former Manchester Terrace (c.1827) and backing on to College Cross, is one of the few developments in this area known to be by Thomas Cubitt, with segmental arched windows.

=== Samuel Lewis Trust Dwellings and Laycock Green ===
The Samuel Lewis Trust Dwellings and adjacent Laycock Green (formerly the site of the Liverpool Buildings) are on the former Laycock Farm.

&quot;Laycock’s Farm &amp; Cattle Lairs&quot; started as early as 1720. Charles Laycock, Jnr. who died in 1777 was &quot;one of the greatest goose-feeders and wholesale poulterers in the kingdom&quot;. Richard Laycock, who died in 1834 was the proprietor of one of the largest dairies in the country and one of the richest dairy-farmers of his day. Over 500 acres were farmed around Liverpool Road and Upper Street, stretching south as far as what is now Islington Park Street, formerly known as Kettle Lane. Cattle being driven to Smithfield would often feed and rest overnight in the cattle lairs which remained until the 1890s in the street named after him. His lairs were covered, and hence more profitable than many others along Liverpool Road. 

In 1882 the Improved Industrial Dwellings Co. Ltd. built four sets of model dwellings, Liverpool Buildings, on part of the farm site at the western end of Highbury Station Road. These had been demolished by 1990, and the land was landscaped as a public park named Laycock Green.

Samuel Lewis was a wealthy financier and philanthropist, who left an endowment of £670,000 for the purpose of establishing a charity to provide housing for the poor. The Samuel Lewis Trust was set up in 1901 and the Samuel Lewis Trust Dwellings at Liverpool Road was the first of eight London housing projects. The estate of 323 dwellings opened on 4 April 1910 and was built by Wallis and Sons Ltd at a cost of £101,000. The buildings were designed by C S Joseph and Smithem and consist of five rows of blocks with trees between them, including notable pollarded planes, and small island gardens set in paved areas. Nikolaus Pevsner described the estate as &quot;the best illustration in Islington of the tremendous improvement in standards of planning and humane appearance that became apparent in the best working class housing around 1900&quot;. The units each had a coal bunker, and there was a bath underneath a wooden top in the kitchens.

In 2001, the Trust celebrated its centenary year and changed its name to Southern Housing Group.

===St Mary Magdalene Church and Gardens===

St Mary Magdalene Church is situated in gardens between Liverpool Road and Holloway Road. It was built in 1814 to a design by William Wickings as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St. Mary&#x27;s farther south on Upper Street. The site chosen had space for both the church and a churchyard and burial ground. However, its final cost, £32,636, was so high that a committee of investigation was appointed, which found that much of it was wasted thanks to an absence of a specific contract. Its design drew little praise. It became a parish church in its own right in 1894, and is now part of the parish of Hope Church Islington.

The actress Jane Russell attended a couple of services at the church in November 1954, while she was filming &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot;.

The church gardens are the church&#x27;s old burial ground. As the land approached the end of its useful life as a burial plot at the end of the 19th century, an Act of Parliament was passed to allow the transition from remembrance gardens into a public park. Many of the tombs and headstones were removed, the land enlarged and formal rose gardens added.

===St Mary Magdalene Academy===

A welcome benefit of the building of St Mary Magdalene Church was a new parochial school, built at the rear alongside what became Liverpool Road, opening in 1815 on half an acre of land and catering for 400 children. It ran on the Madras System (hence the nearby Madras Place), reducing costs by using the abler pupils as &quot;helpers&quot; to the teacher, passing on the information they had learned to other students. On 7th/8 October 1940, a bomb destroyed the school and the surrounding area. A new building was opened in 1954, as a voluntary aided Church of England primary school, junior mixed and infants. The building was rebuilt in 2007, and the school became St Mary Magdalene Academy, with a primary school and a secondary school including sixth form.

===Ring Cross===
Liverpool Road ends at Holloway Road, at the junction formerly known as Ring Cross. Historian John Nelson wrote in 1811: &quot;The wide part of the highway where the Back Road terminates has been timeout of mind called RING CROSS, probably from a cross standing here antecedent to the Reformation&quot;.
A gibbet is alleged to have been in this area where criminals were publicly exhibited in chains, and may have been executed by hanging. 

==Transport==

Liverpool Road crosses the railway lines which form part of London Underground&#x27;s Victoria line and Great Northern&#x27;s Northern City Line, as well as London Overground&#x27;s East and North London lines. The bridge over the railway lines marks the change from the N1 to the N7 postcode.

The first tramway in Islington was opened in 1871 by the North Metropolitan Tramways Co. from the Nag&#x27;s Head, Holloway Road, to the Angel via both Upper Street and Liverpool Road, and on to Finsbury Square. It was extended to Archway Tavern and Finsbury Park in 1872. Liverpool Road proved to be &quot;probably the least revenue-providing thoroughfare of any length in London through which trams operated&quot;, and the service was halted in 1913. There has been no tram or bus service along the road since.

In 2003, traffic calming measures were introduced along the road to reduce the volume and speed of traffic. After changes in 2019 to the layout of Highbury Corner, there was a substantial increase in vehicles rat running along Liverpool Road and other nearby roads to avoid the disruption caused by the new layout, resulting in significantly increased noise and pollution. Residents are lobbying Islington Council for mitigation measures.

<text>lftp is a command-line program client for several file transfer protocols. lftp is designed for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is developed by Alexander Lukyanov, and is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

lftp can transfer files via FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, FISH, SFTP, BitTorrent, and FTP over HTTP proxy. It also supports the File eXchange Protocol (FXP), which allows the client to transfer files from one remote FTP server to another.

Among lftp&#x27;s features are transfer queues, segmented file transfer, resuming partial downloads, bandwidth throttling, and recursive copying of file directories. The client can be used interactively or automated with scripts. It has Unix shell-like job control, and a facility for scheduling file transfers for execution at a later time.

==Development history==
lftp was initially developed as part of the ftpclass package. Subsequently it grew and became a more capable program (e.g., mirroring capability was added), and was renamed to lftp in February 1997. The initial goals of development were robustness, automatic resuming of transfers, and increasing transfer speed by transferring parts of a file in parallel using several connections as well as by protocol pipelining. Version 2.0 introduced HTTP and IPv6 support in 1999, more protocols were added later.

<text>&quot;Nevsky Prospekt&quot; () is a short story by Nikolai Gogol, written between 1831 and 1834 and published in the collection &quot;Arabesques&quot; in 1835.

== Summary ==
Influenced strongly by the sentimental movement, the protagonist of &quot;Nevsky Prospekt&quot; is a pathetic and insignificant romantic, the narrator is chatty and unreliable (along the lines of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, the definitive sentimental novel), and realism dominates. The story is organized symmetrically; the narrator describes Nevsky Prospekt in great detail, then the plot splits to follow in turn two acquaintances, each of whom follows a beautiful woman whom he has seen on the street. The first story follows the romantic hero, the second follows his realistic foil. The story closes with the narrator once more speaking generally of Nevsky Prospekt.

The introduction describes Nevsky Prospekt, the central avenue of St. Petersburg, and its population at different times of the day. The narrator revels in the delights of the street, but he is filled with Poshlost, (defined by literary historian D. S. Mirsky as &quot;&#x27;self-satisfied inferiority,&#x27; moral and spiritual.&quot;) This is exemplified in the repeated admiring descriptions of mustaches, &quot;to which the better part of a life has been devoted.&quot; The description of the street ends abruptly, and the story shifts to the conversation of two acquaintances who have decided to split up to each pursue a different woman seen on the street.

The first story told is of a young, romantic painter, Piskarev, who follows a dark-haired woman (whom he likens to Perugino&#x27;s &quot;Bianca&quot;) to what turns out to be a brothel. However, his interest in the woman is completely innocent and chaste, so he is shocked by her true nature and flees. Back in his room, Piskarev dreams of her as a woman of wealth and virtue. Living only for his dreams, he develops insomnia and turns to opium to restore his ability to sleep and to dream. After dreaming of the woman as his wife, he decides to marry her, but when he returns to the brothel to propose the woman mocks him. Piskarev returns to his lodging and cuts his throat. His funeral is unattended.

The second story is of an officer, Lieutenant Pirogov. Crude and realistic, he is the romantic Piskarev&#x27;s foil. Pirogov follows a blonde woman to her home, but she turns out to be the wife of a German tinsmith. Returning when the husband is out, Pirogov attempts to seduce the woman, but he is caught with the woman in his arms and is flogged. Pirogov is at first furious and determined to seek revenge, but he is mollified by eating puff pastries, reading a reactionary newspaper and spending an evening dancing.

The story concludes with the narrator&#x27;s warning that &quot;Nevsky Prospekt deceives at all hours of the day, but the worst time of all is at night... when the devil himself is abroad, kindling the street-lamps with one purpose only: to show everything in a false light.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
*The fourth season of &quot;Infinity Train&quot; was inspired by Nevsky Prospekt. Particularly, the main characters, Ryan Akagi and Min-Gi Park, were based on romantic Piskarev and realist Pirogov. In the first episode of the season, the short story is even referenced when Min suggests &quot;Nevsky and the Prospekts&quot; as a band name for them.

<text>Arnold Geulincx (; 31 January 1624 – November 1669), also known by his pseudonym Philaretus, was a Flemish philosopher, metaphysician, and logician. He was one of the followers of René Descartes who tried to work out more detailed versions of a generally Cartesian philosophy. Samuel Beckett cited Geulincx as a key influence and interlocutor because of Geulincx&#x27;s emphasis on the powerlessness and ignorance of the human condition.

==Life==

Geulincx was born in Antwerp. He studied philosophy and theology at the University of Leuven and was made professor of philosophy there in 1646. He lost his post in 1658, possibly for religious reasons, or (as has been suggested) a combination of unpopular views and his marriage in that year. In September 1658, Geulincx became a medical doctor. He then moved north to the University of Leiden and converted to Calvinism. Initially he gave private lessons in philosophy. He was appointed reader in logic there in 1662 and professor by special appointment in 1665. Until 1662, Geulincx lived in poverty. He died in Leiden in November 1669, leaving most of his works, all written in Latin, to be published after his death. They were edited by Cornelis Bontekoe.

==Reputation==

Despite Geulincx&#x27;s thesis that God cannot act without an instrumentality of variety, he was strongly attacked in the early eighteenth century, for example, by Ruardus Andala and Carolus Tuinman, as a Spinozist. This criticism had originated from Christian Thomasius in 1710. The attack from Andala was on behalf of the &quot;true&quot; Cartesians, classing Geulincx as pernicious, with Burchardus de Volder, Jean LeClerc, Frederik van Leenhof, Pontiaan van Hattem and Willem Deurhoff. Geulincx was also attacked by the Pietist Joachim Lange, as part of a campaign against Christian Wolff; and regarded with Pierre Bayle as insidiously anti-Christian by Johann Franz Buddeus.

==Philosophy==

Geulincx summarized his philosophy in the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;it exists, therefore it is so&quot;). He believed in a &quot;pre-established harmony&quot; as a solution to the mind–body problem, dying 25 years before Leibniz&#x27;s better-remembered formulation of the idea. In Leibniz&#x27;s philosophy, the doctrine of pre-established harmony was linked with optimism, the notion of this world as the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot;. But Geulincx made no such linkage.

The occasionalism of Geulincx is ethical rather than cosmological in its inception. The first tract of his &quot;Ethics&quot; is a study of what in his terms are the cardinal virtues. Virtue according to Geulincx is the love of God and of Reason (III, 16–17; 29). The cardinal virtues are the properties of virtue which immediately flow from its very essence and have nothing to do with externals: diligence, obedience, justice, humility (III, 17). Humility divides his view of the world into two parts: one, the understanding of our relation to the world; and the other, the concept of our relation to God. Humility consists in the knowledge of self and the forsaking of self. I find in myself nothing that is my own but to know and to will. I therefore must be conscious of all that I do, and that of which I am not conscious is not the product of my own causality. Hence the universal principle of causality if you do not know how a thing is done, then you do not do it. He also states a form of this principle in his &quot;Metaphysica vera&quot;. Since, then, the movements of my body take place without my knowing how the nervous impulse passes to the muscles and there causes them to contract, I do not cause my own bodily actions. &quot;I am therefore a mere spectator of this machine. In it I form naught and renew naught, I neither make anything here nor destroy it. Everything is the work of someone else&quot; (III, 33). This one is the Deity who sees and knows all things. The second part of Geulincx&#x27;s philosophy is connected with Occasionalism as the effect with the cause. Its guiding principle is: Where you can do nothing there also you should desire nothing (III, 222). This leads to a mysticism and asceticism which however must not be taken too seriously for it is tempered by the obligation of caring for the body and propagating the species.

==Works==

All published in Latin, the works appearing in his lifetime were:
* &quot;Quaestiones Quodlibeticae&quot; (1653) with later edition &quot;Saturnalia&quot;;
* &quot;Disputatio medica inauguralis de febribus&quot; (1658);
* &quot;Logica fundamentis suis restituta&quot; (1662)
* &quot;Methodus inveniendi argumenta&quot; (1663)
* &quot;De virtute&quot; (1665).
* &quot;Opera philosophica&quot; Edited by J. P. N. Land, The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1891–1893 (3 vol.)

The &quot;De virtute&quot; was the first part of the &quot;Ethica&quot;, which ran to six parts when published posthumously.

English editions of Geulincx&#x27;s works:
* &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, trans. Martin Wilson, Christoffel Press, 1999.
* &quot;Ethics&quot;, trans. Martin Wilson, Brill, 2006.

==Influence==

He is cited by Samuel Beckett, whose character Murphy remembers the &quot;beautiful Belgo-Latin of Arnold Geulincx&quot; and in particular the gloomy nostrum (frequently repeated by Beckett to inquisitive critics) (roughly: &quot;Where you are worth nothing, there you should want nothing&quot;). In the novel &quot;Molloy&quot; (1950), Beckett&#x27;s eponymous character describes himself as &quot;I who had loved the image of old Geulincx, dead young, who left me free, on the black boat of Ulysses, to crawl towards the East, along the deck&quot;. Geulincx is also mentioned in Beckett&#x27;s short story &quot;The End&quot;.

A citation of Geulincx&#x27;s method of appears in the &quot;Third Essay&quot; of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Genealogy of Morals&quot;.

A quotation from his &quot;Ethics&quot; (, roughly &quot;In this world I can do nothing outside myself&quot;) is used as the epigraph to, and in a sense the title of, A.G. Mojtabai&#x27;s novel &quot;Mundome&quot; (1974).

<doc id="1082423" wikidata="Q289739" url="?curid=1082423" title="Étienne Gilson">
<text>Étienne Henri Gilson (; 13 June 1884 – 19 September 1978) was a French philosopher and historian of philosophy. A scholar of medieval philosophy, he originally specialised in the thought of Descartes; he also philosophized in the tradition of Thomas Aquinas, although he did not consider himself a neo-Thomist philosopher. In 1946 he attained the distinction of being elected an &quot;Immortal&quot; (member) of the Académie française. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

In 2009, the International Étienne Gilson Society was created “to promote the thought of Étienne Gilson and classical philosophy in the academy and culture.” It publishes a journal, &quot;Studia Gilsoniana&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Paris to a Roman Catholic family originally from Burgundy, Gilson attended the minor seminary at Notre-Dame-des-Champs, then finished his secondary education at the Lycée Henri IV. After finishing his military service, during which he began to read René Descartes, he studied for his &quot;licence&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degree), focusing on the influence of scholasticism on Cartesian thought. After studying at the Sorbonne under Victor Delbos (1862–1916), and Lucien Lévy-Bruhl and at the Collège de France under Henri Bergson, he finished his degree in philosophy in 1906. 

In 1908, he married Thérèse Ravisé of Melun, and he taught in the high schools of Bourg-en-Bresse, Rochefort, Tours, Saint-Quentin and Angers. In 1913, while employed in teaching at the University of Lille, he defended his doctoral dissertation at the University of Paris on &quot;Liberty in Descartes and Theology&quot; (&quot;La Liberté chez Descartes et la Théologie&quot;). 

His career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, as he was drafted into the French Army as a sergeant. He served on the front and took part in the Battle of Verdun as second lieutenant. He was captured in February 1916 and spent two years in captivity. During this time he devoted himself to new areas of study, including the Russian language and St. Bonaventure. He was later awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery in action.

In 1919, he became professor of the history of philosophy at the University of Strasbourg. From 1921 to 1932, he taught the history of medieval philosophy at the University of Paris. At the invitation of the Congregation of St. Basil, in 1929, he set up the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies in Toronto in conjunction with St. Michael&#x27;s College at the University of Toronto, which now hosts an annual Étienne Gilson Lecture. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1929. As an internationally renowned thinker, Gilson was first, along with Jacques Maritain, to receive an honorary doctorate in philosophy from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (&quot;Angelicum&quot;) in 1930.

He taught as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy at Indiana University for 1939-1940.
He also taught for three years at Harvard. He was elected to the Académie française in 1946. In 1948, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society.

With the death of his wife, Thérèse Ravisé, on 12 November 1949, Gilson endured a considerable emotional shock.

In 1951, he relinquished his chair to Martial Gueroult at the Collège de France to devote himself completely to the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies until 1968. He knew the Jesuit theologian and cardinal Henri de Lubac. Their correspondence has been published. Although Gilson was primarily a historian of philosophy, he was also at the forefront of the 20th century revival of Thomism, along with Jacques Maritain. His work has received critical praise from Richard McKeon.

==Work==

Gilson undertook an in-depth analysis of Thomism from a historical perspective. To Gilson, Thomism is certainly not identical with scholasticism in the pejorative sense, but rather a revolt against it. Gilson considered the philosophy of his own era to be deteriorating into a discipline which would signal humanity&#x27;s abdication of the right to judge and rule nature, relegating humanity into a mere part of nature, which in turn would give the green light for the most reckless of social adventures to play havoc with human lives and institutions. Against &quot;systems&quot; of philosophy, Gilson was convinced that a revival of the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas would lead to the way out of that danger zone.

In his time, Gilson was the leading scholar of the history of medieval philosophy as well as a highly regarded philosopher in his own right. His works continue to be reprinted and studied today – perhaps alone among &quot;Thomist&quot; philosophers, his work and reputation have not suffered from the general decline of interest in and regard for medieval philosophy since the 1960s.

<doc id="1082424" wikidata="Q5233753" url="?curid=1082424" title="USS Gurnard (SS-254)">
<text>USS &quot;Gurnard&quot; (SS-254), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gurnard.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Gurnard&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut, on 2 September 1941. She was launched on 1 June 1942, sponsored by Miss Suzanne Slingluff, and commissioned on 18 September 1942.

==Atlantic Patrol==
Following shakedown from New London, Connecticut, &quot;Gurnard&quot; sailed for Rosneath, Scotland, 2 November 1942 and reached that port 13 days later. Her first war patrol, 28 November to 27 December 1942, brought her to the Bay of Biscay where she lay off the Spanish coast awaiting German blockade runners bound for Spanish ports. The patrol was uneventful; no enemy ships were sighted and subsequently &quot;Gurnard&quot; returned to New London 9 February 1943 for repairs and alterations.

==Pacific Patrols==

=== Second, third, and fourth war patrols, May 1943 – January 1944 ===

After reaching Pearl Harbor 26 May, the submarine got underway 12 June for her second war patrol. She patrolled off Toagel Mlungui Passage and on 29 June saw action for the first time, damaging two Japanese merchantmen and surviving 24 depth charges thrown by an enemy destroyer. Varied damage was inflicted on other ships in these waters before &quot;Gurnard&quot; made her first kill, sinking cargo ship &quot;Taiko Maru&quot; at . on 11 June 1943. Having expended all torpedoes, the submarine returned via Midway Island to Pearl Harbor, arriving 26 July for refit.

On 6 September, she set sail once again, this time heading towards the South China Sea for her third war patrol. In the early hours of 7 October, a five-ship convoy came into view, prompting Gurnard to initiate a pursuit. By 01:39 on 8 October, Gurnard had closed in on the convoy and successfully sunk the cargo ship Taian Maru and the passenger-cargo ship Dainichi Maru west of Luzon. This highly successful patrol concluded on 28 October when Gurnard arrived at Pearl Harbor.

One month later she sailed on her fourth patrol to prowl off the southeast coast of Honshū and soon found good hunting. A convoy was sighted 24 December and at 07:10 &quot;Gurnard&quot; attacked. Two minutes later cargo ship &quot;Seizan Maru No. 2&quot; had broken in two and sunk; she was soon joined by cargo ship &quot;Tofuku Maru&quot;. Japanese destroyers attacked the submarine with over 80 depth charges without success. The crew celebrated by taking a couple of snaps of Mt. Fuji. They then had their Christmas dinner in Tokyo Bay. After damaging another merchantman on 27 December, &quot;Gurnard&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 7 January 1944. From there she was sent Stateside for overhaul.

=== Fifth, sixth, and seventh war patrols, April – November 1944 ===

Following overhaul at San Francisco &quot;Gurnard&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 16 April on her fifth war patrol, bound for the eastern Celebes Sea. On this patrol she chalked up one of the highest single-patrol tonnage scores of the Pacific war, attacking the Take Ichi convoy on 6 May and sinking 6,886-ton cargo ship &quot;Tenshinzan Maru&quot;, 6,995-ton passenger-cargo vessel &quot;Taijima Maru&quot;, and 5,824-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Aden Maru&quot;. Nearly a hundred depth charges rained down around her but she eluded the hunters and escaped undamaged. This vital convoy carried 40,000 troops intended to oppose Gen. MacArthur in New Guinea, and the embarked units suffered losses of nearly 50 percent. &quot;Gurnard&quot;&#x27;s next kill occurred 24 May when several torpedoes sent to the bottom the 10,090-ton tanker &quot;Tatekawa Maru&quot;. No further opportunities presented themselves; and &quot;Gurnard&quot; put in at Fremantle, 11 June 1944 with the completion of the patrol.

The submarine stood out on her sixth patrol 8 July for the Banda, Molucca, Celebes, Sulu, and Mindanao Seas. After topping off at Darwin she patrolled off the Peleng Straits and damaged one merchantman before returning to Fremantle 5 September.

&quot;Gurnard&quot;&#x27;s seventh patrol commenced 9 October after refit. While cruising off Borneo, she detected a five-ship enemy convoy. A successful attack was pressed home 3 November at the end of an 18-hour hunt, and two torpedoes demolished cargo ship &quot;Taimei Maru&quot;. &quot;Gurnard&quot; returned to her Australian port 17 November after this victory.

=== Eighth and ninth war patrols, December 1944 – May 1945 ===

The submarine&#x27;s eighth and ninth patrols (11 December 1944 – 1 February 1945 and 10 March – 9 May 1945) included reconnaissance off Camranh Bay and patrols with submarines and , but hunting was poor and no ships were sunk. &quot;Gurnard&quot; finished her final patrol at Pearl Harbor 9 May and put in at Mare Island, California, nine days later for a major overhaul. Following a round-trip voyage thence to Pearl Harbor and Midway, she returned to San Francisco 11 September 1945 and decommissioned there 27 November 1945.

&quot;Gurnard&quot; remained in reserve until 1 July 1949 when she reported to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for activation as an armory for naval reserve submarine training. Towed to Pearl Harbor 27 November to 9 December 1949, the submarine served there until returning under tow to Tacoma, Wash., 18 May 1953 to continue reserve training duties in that port until June 1960. She was then inactivated in preparation for disposal. Her name was stricken from the Navy List 1 May 1961. She was sold for scrapping 26 September 1961 to the National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California

==Awards==
* Navy Unit Commendation
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with six battle stars for service in World War II

&quot;Gurnard&quot;′s war patrols numbers two through seven were designated &quot;successful.&quot;

<text>Scientific [[essentialism]], a view espoused by Saul Kripke and Hilary Putnam, maintains that there exist essential properties that objects possess (or instantiate) necessarily. In other words, having such and such essential properties is a necessary condition for membership in a given natural kind. For example, tigers are tigers in virtue of possessing a particular set of genetic properties, but identifying (or appearance-based) properties are nonessential properties. If a tiger lost a leg, or didn&#x27;t possess stripes, we would still call it a tiger. They are not necessary for being a member of the class of tigers.

It is important, however, that the set of essential properties of an object not be used to identify or be identified with that object because they are not &quot;necessary and sufficient&quot;, but only necessary. Having such and such a genetic code does not suffice for being a tiger. We wouldn&#x27;t call a piece of tiger tail a tiger, even though a piece of tiger tail contains the genetic information essential to being a tiger.

Other advocates of scientific essentialism include Brian Ellis, Caroline Lierse, John Bigelow, and Alexander Bird.

<text>Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is a museum and art gallery in Glasgow, Scotland, managed by Glasgow Museums. The building is located in Kelvingrove Park in the West End of the city, adjacent to Argyle Street. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is one of Scotland&#x27;s most popular museums and free visitor attractions.

The art gallery and museum opened in 1901, and the collection encompasses natural history, Egyptian antiquities, design, architecture, medieval arms and armoury, Scottish history and the history of Glasgow. The building also houses one of Europe’s great civic art collections, including Scottish, European, African, Asian and Oceanic fine and decorative arts.

Kelvingrove re-opened in 2006 after a three-year, £27 million refurbishment and restoration, with the collections re-organised into two halves: Life and Expression. The Life galleries represent natural history, human history and prehistory. The Expression galleries include the fine art collections. The 22 galleries display over 8,000 objects. Notable exhibits include Salvador Dali’s &quot;Christ of St John of the Cross&quot;, Sir Roger the Asian elephant, the Avant armour, and paintings by the Glasgow Boys and the Scottish Colourists.

==Original museum==

The original Kelvingrove Museum opened in 1870 as the City Industrial Museum, Glasgow&#x27;s first municipal museum. It was housed in Kelvingrove House, a mansion which was built in 1783 and was originally the home of Lord Provost Patrick Colquhoun. Kelvingrove House stood to the east of the present art gallery museum, on the site now occupied by Kelvingrove Park&#x27;s skatepark. The Kelvingrove Museum&#x27;s growing collection led to a new wing being added to the house between 1874 and 1876. The original Kelvingrove House was demolished in 1899, with the museum wing being demolished in 1911.

==Creation (1888–1901)==

The construction of Kelvingrove was partly financed by the proceeds of the 1888 International Exhibition held in Kelvingrove Park. The gallery was designed by Sir John W. Simpson and E.J. Milner Allen, and opened in 1901 as the Palace of Fine Arts for the Glasgow International Exhibition held in that year. It is built in a Spanish Baroque style, follows the Glaswegian tradition of using Locharbriggs red sandstone, and includes an entire program of architectural sculpture by George Frampton, William Shirreffs, Francis Derwent Wood and other sculptors.

The centrepiece of the Centre Hall is a concert pipe organ constructed and installed by Lewis &amp; Co. The organ was originally commissioned as part of the Glasgow International Exhibition, held in Kelvingrove Park in 1901. The organ was installed in the concert hall of the exhibition, which was capable of seating 3,000 people. The Centre Hall of the then newly completed Art Gallery and Museum was intended from the beginning to be a space in which to hold concerts. When the 1901 exhibition ended, a Councillor urged the Glasgow Corporation (now Glasgow Council) to purchase the organ, stating that without it, &quot;the art gallery would be a body without a soul&quot;. Purchase price and installation costs were met from the surplus exhibition proceeds, and the organ was installed in the Centre Hall by Lewis and Co. The present case front in walnut with non-functional display pipes was commissioned at this time from John W. Simpson. Simpson was the senior partner of Simpson &amp; Milner Allen, architects of the gallery building.

There is an urban myth in Glasgow that the building was accidentally built back-to-front, and the architect jumped from one of the towers in despair upon realising his mistake. In reality, the grand entrance was always intended to face into Kelvingrove Park.

==Refurbishment (2003–2006)==
Kelvingrove was reopened by Queen Elizabeth II on 11 July 2006 after a three-year closure for major refurbishment and restoration. The work, which cost around £35million, was one-third funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and one-third by public donations to the appeal and included a new restaurant and a large basement extension to its display space to accommodate the 8,000 exhibits now on display. A new layout and wayfinding scheme was introduced to make the building more visitor-friendly, which was designed and executed by London-based museum design company, Event Communications. As part of the renovations a Spitfire (serial LA198) that had previously been operated by the No. 602 Squadron RAF (City of Glasgow) was hung from the ceiling above the life gallery.

Immediately after its 2003–2006 refurbishment, the museum was the most popular free-to-enter visitor attraction in Scotland, recording 2.23million visitors in 2007. These numbers made it the most visited museum in the United Kingdom outside London that year. From 2006 to 2009 the museum had 5 million visitors.

==Collections==
The museum&#x27;s collections came mainly from the original Kelvingrove Museum and the McLellan Galleries. It has one of the finest collections of arms and armour in the world and a vast natural history collection. The art collection includes many outstanding European artworks, including works by the Old Masters (Vecellio&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child with Saint Jerome and Saint Dorothy&quot;, Rembrandt van Rijn, Gerard de Lairesse, and Jozef Israëls), French Impressionists (such as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh and Mary Cassatt), Dutch Renaissance, Scottish Colourists and exponents of the Glasgow School.

The museum houses &quot;Christ of Saint John of the Cross&quot; by Salvador Dalí. The copyright of this painting was bought by the curator at the time after a meeting with Dalí. Between 1993 and 2006, the painting was moved to the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art.

The museum also contains a large gift of the decorative arts from Anne Hull Grundy, an art collector and philanthropist, covering the history of European jewellery in the 18th and 19th centuries.

<doc id="1082448" wikidata="Q64162" url="?curid=1082448" title="Ludwig von Pastor">
<text>Ludwig Pastor, ennobled as Ludwig von Pastor, [[Freiherr]] von Campersfelden (31 January 1854 – 30 September 1928), was a German historian and diplomat for Austria. He became one of the most important Roman Catholic historians of his time and is most notable for his &quot;History of the Popes&quot;. He was raised to the nobility by the Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1908 and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature six times.

==Early life==
Born in Aachen to a Lutheran father and a Catholic mother, Pastor was converted to Catholicism at ten, after his father&#x27;s death. He attended a Frankfurt gymnasium, where his teacher was Johannes Janssen who introduced him to historical studies.

Pastor studied in 1875 at Leuven, in 1875/76 at Bonn, where he became a member of the student corporation Arminia, and in 1877/78 at Vienna. Pastor taught at the University of Innsbruck, first as a lecturer (1881–87), then as professor of modern history (1887). His dissertation was titled &quot;Die kirchlichen Reunionsbestrebungen während der Regierung Karls V&quot; (The Church&#x27;s Attempts at Reunion During the Reign of Charles V). Pastor edited his mentor Janssen&#x27;s eight-volume &quot;Geschichte des deutschen Volkes&quot; (History of the German People) and published it from 1893 to 1926.

==&quot;History of the Popes&quot;==
Janssen had made him aware of Leopold von Ranke&#x27;s &quot;History of the Popes&quot;. This determined the field he would take for his own, becoming in a sense a Catholic anti-Ranke. His approach was that the apparent shortcomings of the Papacy reflected flaws of their times. Pastor consulted archives throughout Catholic Europe and, during his first trip to Italy in 1881, his seriousness ensured the patronage of Pope Leo XIII, who opened to him the contents of the Vatican Library, which had previously been held unavailable to scholars.

He was granted privileged access to the Secret Vatican Archives, and his history, largely based on hitherto unavailable original documents, superseded all previous histories of the popes in the period he covered, which runs from the Avignon Papacy of 1305 to Napoleon&#x27;s entrance in Rome, 1799. He also investigated the archives of public and private libraries and archives in Italy and Europe, demonstrating an extraordinary capacity for work and rare sagacity in discovering interesting documents.

Pastor decided to begin his work with the papacy of Pope Clement V (1305–1314) and the onset of the Avignon Papacy, so that he could concentrate his research on surviving documents. His dispassionate and frank papal history concentrated on individual popes rather than on the developments of papal institutions. Pastor&#x27;s tomes span the pontificates of 56 popes, from Clement V to Pius VI. 
He combined painstaking scholarship with erudition. The result of his research was his &quot;Geschichte der Päpste seit dem Ausgang des Mittelalters&quot; in sixteen volumes. The &quot;opus magnum&quot; was subsequently translated into English and published as &quot;History of the Popes From the Close of the Middle Ages&quot;.

Pastor began his work in 1886 and wrote throughout the pontificates of Leo XIII, Pius X, Benedict XV and Pius XI, publishing fifteen volumes. The 16th and final volume was published posthumously in 1930. The English translations were published between 1899 and 1953.

==Academic memberships, honours and offices==
In 1901, Pastor was appointed director of the Austrian Historical Institute in Rome, which he headed (with an interruption 1914-1919) until his death.

He also was a member of the Emperor Franz-Joseph Academy in Prague, corresponding member of the Società Colombaria in Florence, member of the Papal Academy in Rome, of the Academy of Cracow and the Académie Royale d&#x27;Archéologie de Belgique in Antwerp. He achieved an honorary membership of the Academy of St Luke in Rome, an honorary doctorate at the University of Leuven, and membership in the historical section of the Görres Society.

He received the positions of Commander of the Papal Order of St Sylvester Pope and Martyr, of Knight of the Papal Order of Saint Pius IX, of Commander of the Austrian Order of Franz Joseph and of the Royal Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.

Emperor Francis Joseph I elevated him to the nobility in 1908 and gave him the title Freiherr von Campersfelden in 1916. In 1921 he was appointed the Republic of Austria&#x27;s ambassador to the Holy See, and died in Innsbruck in 1928.

==Works==

<text>Land law is the form of law that deals with the rights to use, alienate, or exclude others from . In many jurisdictions, these kinds of property are referred to as real estate or real property, as distinct from personal property. Land use agreements, including renting, are an important intersection of property and contract law. Encumbrance on the land rights of one, such as an easement, may constitute the land rights of another. Mineral rights and water rights are closely linked, and often interrelated concepts.

Land rights are such a basic form of law that they develop even where there is no state to enforce them; for example, the claim clubs of the American West were institutions that arose organically to enforce the system of rules appurtenant to mining. &quot;Squatting&quot;, the occupation of land without ownership, is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon.
Indigenous land rights is also a perennial related issue.

==National sovereignty==
Sovereignty, in common law jurisdictions, is often referred to as absolute title, radical title, or allodial title. Nearly all of these jurisdictions have a system of land registration, to record fee simple interests, and a land claim process to resolve disputes.

==Land rights==

Indigenous land rights are recognized by international law, as well as the national legal systems of common law and civil law countries. In common law jurisdictions, the land rights of indigenous peoples are referred to as aboriginal title. In customary law jurisdictions, customary land is the predominant form of land ownership.

Land reform refers to government policies that take and/or redistribute land, such as a land grant.

Land rights refer to the inalienable ability of individuals to freely obtain, use, and possess land at their discretion, as long as their activities on the land do not impede on other individuals&#x27; rights. This is not to be confused with access to land, which allows individuals the use of land in an economic sense (i.e. farming). Instead, land rights address the ownership of land which provides security and increases human capabilities. When a person only has access to land, they are in constant threat of expulsion depending on the choices of the land owner, which limits financial stability.

Land rights are an integral part of Land Laws, as they socially enforce groups of individuals&#x27; rights to own land in concurrence with the land laws of a nation. Land Law addresses the legal mandates set forth by a country in regards to land ownership, while land rights refer to the social acceptance of land ownership. Landesa takes the stance that although the law may advocate for equal access to land, land rights in certain countries and cultures may hinder a group&#x27;s right to actually own land. Laws are important, but they must be backed up by cultural tradition and social acceptance. Therefore, laws concerning land ownership and land rights of a country must be in agreement.

Globally, there has been an increased focus on land rights, as they are so pertinent to various aspects of development. According to Wickeri and Kalhan, land ownership can be a critical source of capital, financial security, food, water, shelter, and resources. The UN Global Land Tool organisation has found that rural landlessness is a strong predictor of poverty and hunger, and negatively impacts Empowerment and the realisation of Human rights. In order to home in on this critical problem of inadequate land rights, The Millennium Development Goal 7D strives to improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers. This includes increased land rights for impoverished people, which will ultimately lead to a higher quality of life.

Although land rights are fundamental in achieving higher standards of living, certain groups of individuals are consistently left out of land ownership provisions. The law may provide access to land, however, cultural barriers and poverty traps limit minority groups&#x27; ability to own land. In order to reach equality, these groups must obtain adequate land rights that are both socially and legally recognised.

==Limits of national jurisdiction and sovereignty==

==Land rights and women==
Several scholars argue that women&#x27;s lack of sufficient land rights negatively affects their immediate families and the larger community, as well. With land ownership, women can develop an income and allocate this income more fairly within the household. Tim Hanstad claims that providing sufficient land rights for women is beneficial because, once women can exercise those rights the following will be promoted:
* Women will be less likely to contract and spread HIV/AIDS as they do not have to resort to prostitution
* Women will be less likely to be victims of Domestic violence
* Their children will be more likely to get an education and stay in school longer
* Women will be better positioned to get access to Microcredit

In many parts of the world, women have access to land in order to farm and cultivate the land; however, there are traditions and cultural norms which bar women from inheriting or purchasing land. This puts women in a place of dependence on their husbands, brothers, or fathers for their livelihood and shelter. Should there be an illness, domestic violence, or death in the family, women would be left landless and unable to either grow crops for food, or rent land for profit. Land ownership for women is a crucial form of security and income, increasing Empowerment and decreasing Poverty.

===India===
Kanakalatha Mukund makes the important point that although women in India have the legal right to own land, very few actually do as a result of the patriarchal practices which dominate the nation. Up until recently, Indian women have been left out of laws regarding the distribution of public land and were forced to rely on the small possibility of obtaining private land from their families. Inheritance laws which cater towards men are one of the key issues behind inequality in land rights. According to Bina Agarwal, land ownership defines social status and political power in the household and in the village, shaping relationships and creating family dynamics. Therefore, inheritance of land automatically puts men above women both in the household, and in the community. Without political pull in the village, and with limited bargaining powers within the household, women lack the voice to advocate for their own rights.

Another issue with land rights in India is that they leave women completely dependent on the lives of their husbands. A study by Bina Agarwal found that in West Bengal, prosperous families turn destitute when the male head of the household dies, as women are not permitted to take over their husband&#x27;s land. Also, due to cultural tradition, the higher the status of the woman, the less likely she is to have any developed skills that would be useful in finding work. These women are forced to beg for food and shelter once their husbands die because they have not been allowed to gain work experience.

Bina Agarwal argues that land ownership significantly decreases the chance of domestic violence against Indian women. Owning property elevates women to a higher status within the household, allowing more equality and bargaining power. In addition, owning property separately from their husbands allowed women an opportunity of escape from abusive relationships. Agarwal concluded that the prospect of a safe shelter outside of the main household decreases the longevity of domestic violence.

Land rights are critical for women in India due to the heavily patriarchal society in which they live. Cultural perspectives play a key role in the acceptance of equality within land ownership. Women owning land ultimately benefits the household and society as a whole.

The most recent advance towards equality in land rights in India was the Hindu Succession Act of 2005. This act aimed to remove the gender discrimination which was present in the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. In the new amendment, daughters and sons have equal rights to obtain land from their parents. This act was both a legally and socially important move for women&#x27;s rights to land. Not only did it legally mandate equality in land succession, it also validated women&#x27;s roles as equals in society.

===Uganda===
Uganda&#x27;s 1995 Constitution enforces equality between men and women, including the acquisition and ownership of land. However, research from Women&#x27;s Land Link Africa reveals that women remain excluded from land ownership due to customs and deeply ingrained cultural habits. Even when women save up enough money to purchase land, the land is signed in their husband&#x27;s name, while women sign as the witness. Inheritance practices are a particular obstacle which reduces women empowerment, as well. Land is passed down through male lineage which reinforces women&#x27;s exclusion from land ownership. Another detriment to equality, pointed out by Women&#x27;s Land Link Africa, is that women lack sufficient knowledge about the rights they have under the law to own land. Rural, illiterate women do not even have access to the new constitution which guarantees them land rights.

Although the 1995 Constitution provides for equality between men and women, there are still gaps in the law which affect women&#x27;s rights to land. The law protects the rights to land of wives in marriage; however, it does not address the needs of widows or divorcees. Consequentially, these women are left landless and without the protection land offers. Also, women have a difficult time taking cases to court due to corruption and expensive trials. The trials concerning land take so long to process that many women do not even attempt to seek legal assistance.

Women&#x27;s Land Link Africa provides suggestions to alleviate inequality in land ownership. Rural women can be educated about their rights through radio campaigns, community discussions, educational outreach programs, and public forums. The cultural nuances must be addressed in policies and community leaders can be educated about inclusion of minority groups. Also, the law itself can address the rights of widows and divorcees in addition to the rights of married women.

<text>The [[Palace of Sports]] ( ) is an indoor sport-concert complex situated in the center of Kyiv, Ukraine. The complex is an independent state enterprise.

==History==
It was built between 1958 and 1960, to design of Mykhailo Hrechyna and Oleksiy Zavarov, as a major indoor sports arena and was opened on 9 December 1960. Constructivist Architecture, an artistic movement sporting mostly simple geometric forms was used in the design.

In the first 50 years, the Sports Palace was the venue for 16 world championships, 28 European championships, 42 championships of the USSR and more than 4,000 concerts and theatre shows as stage performances. In addition, there were around 400 exhibitions and fairs. The events attracted more than 24 million visitors.

===Renovations===
In 1980–1982, the Palace of Sport was reconstructed (by the Kyivproject Institute and the Kyiv Zonal Scientific Research Institute for Experimental Design). The lighting and technical facilities were almost completely modernized, the interiors and halls were expanded and otherwise illuminated, the palace was equipped with numerous changing rooms and sideboards.

The Palace of Sports was confirmed by officials as the host venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 in September 2004. However, in order to host the contest, the facilities had been brought up to the standard required by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). At the end of December 2004, work began on the renovation of the hall, for which approximately 4 million francs were allocated. Renovation works were to be finished by 20 April, however, they were completed at the beginning of May. The arena could accommodate over 5,000 seated spectators. Additionally 2,000 press delegates were catered for.

A further reconstruction took place from October 2010 in preparation to host matches for the 2011 IIHF World Championship Division I. As part of the reconstruction, the backstage space was completely re-equipped, six sports locker rooms were installed, the hall lighting was modernized, and the ventilation, air-conditioning, heating and fire safety systems were completely replaced. In addition, a modern quadrilateral display appeared above the arena. In the stands, plastic seats were installed in the colors of the national flag: the total number of seats is 6,900 for sporting events, increased to 9,800 when in concert-mode.

==Events==
The venue hosts indoor sports games, concerts, major exhibitions and trade fairs.

===Sport===

The hall hosts ice hockey, basketball and boxing competitions. The home teams have included the ice hockey club Sokil Kyiv and the basketball clubs BC Kyiv and BC Budivelnyk.

Major sporting events to be held at the arena include the 2012 Professional Hockey League All-Star Game, 2013 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship and 2013 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships.

===Eurovision===
It hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, which required the facilities to be brought up to the standard stipulated by the European Broadcasting Union. Four years later, the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009 was hosted in the venue. It is one of the two venues to have hosted both the junior and adult versions of the song contest (The other being Rotterdam Ahoy which hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007 and the Eurovision Song Contest 2021).

===Concerts===
The Sports Palace is also a popular venue for concerts, having been the venue for Didier Marouani and Space on 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 of July 1983, Ace of Base, Backstreet Boys, Black Eyed Peas, Britney Spears, Deep Purple, Judas Priest, A-ha, Jamiroquai, Jean Michel Jarre, Moby, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Muse, Placebo, Limp Bizkit, The Rasmus, Christina Aguilera, Anastacia, Lenny Kravitz, Chris Rea, Lara Fabian, Depeche Mode, Sting, Marilyn Manson, The Prodigy and others.
