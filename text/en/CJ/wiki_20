<text>Clomifene, also known as clomiphene, is a medication used to treat infertility in women who do not ovulate, including those with polycystic ovary syndrome. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include pelvic pain and hot flashes. Other side effects can include changes in vision, vomiting, trouble sleeping, ovarian cancer, and seizures. It is not recommended in people with liver disease or abnormal vaginal bleeding of unknown cause or who are pregnant. Clomifene is in the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) family of medication and is a nonsteroidal medication. It works by causing the release of GnRH by the hypothalamus, and subsequently gonadotropin from the anterior pituitary.
Clomifene was approved for medical use in the United States in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Its introduction began the era of assisted reproductive technology.

Clomifene (particularly the purified enclomiphene isomer) has also been found to have a powerful ability to boost or restore testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. It can be used to enhance performance in sports and is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
==Medical uses==

===Reproductive medicine===
Clomifene is one of several alternatives for inducing ovulation in those who are infertile due to anovulation or oligoovulation. Evidence is lacking for the use of clomifene in those who are infertile without a known reason. In such cases, studies have observed a clinical pregnancy rate 5.6% per cycle with clomifene treatment vs. 1.3%–4.2% per cycle without treatment. Clomifene has also been used with other assisted reproductive technology to increase success rates of these other modalities.

Clomifene has been effectively used to restore spermatogenesis in trans women looking to have biological children. The effect of feminizing hormone therapy on fertility is not clear, but it is known that it can prevent sperm production.

==== Testosterone replacement therapy ====
Clomifene is sometimes used in the treatment of male hypogonadism as an alternative to testosterone replacement therapy. It has been found to increase testosterone levels by 2–2.5 times in hypogonadal men at such dosages. Despite the use of questionnaires in testosterone replacement comparator trials being called into question, clomifene&#x27;s lower cost, therapeutic benefits, and greater value towards hypogonadism improvement have been noted.

Clomifene consists of two stereoisomers in equal proportion: enclomifene and zuclomifene. Zuclomifene has pro-estrogenic properties, whereas enclomifene is pro-androgenic, i.e. it promotes testosterone production through stimulation of the HPG axis. For this reason, purified enclomifene isomer has been found to be twice as effective in boosting testosterone compared to the standard mix of both isomers. Additionally, enclomifene has a half-life of just ten hours, but zuclomifene has a half-life on the order of several days to a week, so if the goal is to boost testosterone, taking regular clomifene may produce far longer-lasting pro-estrogenic effects than pro-androgenic effects.

==== Gynecomastia ====
Clomifene has been used in the treatment of gynecomastia. It has been found to be useful in the treatment of some cases of gynecomastia but it is not as effective as tamoxifen or raloxifene for this indication. It has shown variable results for gynecomastia (probably because the zuclomifene isomer is estrogenic), and hence is not recommended for treatment of the condition. Pure enclomifene isomer is likely to be more effective than clomifene at treating gynecomastia, because of the lack of the zuclomifene isomer (as noted above).

Due to its long half-life, zuclomifene can be detected in urine for at least 261 days after discontinuation (261 days after discontinuation with a half-life of 30 days, there is still 0.24% of the peak level of zuclomifene being excreted, whereas with a half-life of ten hours, enclomifene reaches the same 0.24% level in less than four days).

== Prohibited use in sports ==
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibits clomifene under category S4 of hormone and metabolic modulators. It can be present as an undeclared ingredient in black market products available online to enhance athletic performance. Like other substances with anabolic properties, clomifene leads to increased muscle mass in males.

Because clomifene can enhance egg production in hens, athletes may inadvertently consume the substance through contaminated food. A WADA study found that clomifene given to laying hens migrates into their eggs but was able to develop a method of distinguishing egg ingestion from doping.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications include an allergy to the medication, pregnancy, prior liver problems, abnormal vaginal bleeding of unclear cause, ovarian cysts other than those due to polycystic ovarian syndrome, unmanaged adrenal or thyroid problems, and pituitary tumors.

==Side effects==
The most common adverse drug reaction associated with the use of clomifene (&gt;10% of people) is reversible ovarian enlargement.

Less common effects (1–10% of people) include visual symptoms (blurred vision, double vision, floaters, eye sensitivity to light, scotomata), headaches, vasomotor flushes (or hot flashes), light sensitivity and pupil constriction, abnormal uterine bleeding and/or abdominal discomfort.

Rare adverse events (&lt;1% of people) include: high blood level of triglycerides, liver inflammation, reversible baldness and/or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

Rates of birth defects and miscarriages do not appear to change with the use of clomifene for fertility. Clomifene has been associated with liver abnormalities and a couple of cases of hepatotoxicity.

===Cancer risk===
Some studies have suggested that clomifene if used for more than a year may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. This may only be the case in those who have never been and do not become pregnant. Subsequent studies have failed to support those findings.

Clomifene has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of malignant melanomas and thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer risk was not associated with the number of pregnancies carried to viability.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Selective estrogen receptor modulator activity====
Clomifene is a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivative that acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). It consists of a non-racemic mixture of zuclomifene (~38%) and enclomifene (~62%), each of which has unique pharmacologic properties. It is a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER). Clomifene activates the ERα in the setting of low baseline estrogen levels and partially blocks the receptor in the context of high baseline estrogen levels. Conversely, it is an antagonist of the ERβ. Clomifene has antiestrogenic effects in the uterus. There is little clinical research on the influence of clomifene in many target tissues, such as lipids, the cardiovascular system, and the breasts. Positive effects of clomifene on bone have been observed. Clomifene has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in women.

Clomifene is a long-acting ER ligand, with a nuclear retention of greater than 48 hours. Clomifene is a prodrug being activated via similar metabolic pathways as the related triphenylethylene SERMs tamoxifen and toremifene. The affinity of clomifene for the ER relative to estradiol ranges from 0.1 to 12% in different studies, which is similar to the range for tamoxifen (0.06–16%). 4-Hydroxyclomifene, a major active metabolite of clomifene, and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen), a major active metabolite of tamoxifen, show 89–251% and 41–246% of the affinity of estradiol for the ER in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, respectively. The ER affinities of the isomers of 4-hydroxyclomifene were 285% for (&quot;E&quot;)-4-hydroxyclomifene and 16% for (&quot;Z&quot;)-4-hydroxyclomifene relative to estradiol. 4-Hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphene has similar affinity to 4-hydroxyclomifene for the ER. In one study, the affinities of clomifene and its metabolites for the ERα were ~100 nM for clomifene, ~2.4 nM for 4-hydroxyclomifene, ~125 nM for &quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphene, and ~1.4 nM for 4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphene.

Even though clomifene has some estrogenic effect, the antiestrogenic property is believed to be the primary source for stimulating ovulation. Clomifene appears to act mostly in the hypothalamus where it depletes hypothalamic ERs and blocks the negative feedback effect of circulating endogenous estradiol, which in turn results in an increase in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse frequency and circulating concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

In normal physiologic female hormonal cycling, at seven days past ovulation, high levels of estrogen and progesterone produced from the corpus luteum inhibit GnRH, FSH, and LH at the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. If fertilization does not occur in the post-ovulation period the corpus luteum disintegrates due to a lack of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This would normally be produced by the embryo in the effort of maintaining progesterone and estrogen levels during pregnancy.

Therapeutically, clomifene is given early in the menstrual cycle to produce follicles. Follicles, in turn, produce the estrogen, which circulates in serum. In the presence of clomifene, the body perceives a low level of estrogen, similar to day 22 in the previous cycle. Since estrogen can no longer effectively exert negative feedback on the hypothalamus, GnRH secretion becomes more rapidly pulsatile, which results in increased pituitary gonadotropin release. (More rapid, lower amplitude pulses of GnRH lead to increased LH and FSH secretion, while more irregular, larger amplitude pulses of GnRH leads to a decrease in the ratio of LH to FSH.) Increased FSH levels cause the growth of more ovarian follicles, and subsequently rupture of follicles resulting in ovulation. Ovulation occurs most often 6 to 7 days after a course of clomifene.

In normal men, 50 mg/day clomifene for eight months has been found to increase testosterone levels by around 870 ng/dL in younger men and by around 490 ng/dL in elderly men. Estradiol levels increased by 62 pg/mL in younger men and by 40 pg/mL in elderly men. These findings suggest that the progonadotropic effects of clomifene are stronger in younger men than in older men. In men with hypogonadism, clomifene has been found to increase testosterone levels by 293 to 362 ng/dL and estradiol levels by 5.5 to 13 pg/mL. In a large clinical study of men with low testosterone levels (&lt;400 ng/dL), 25 mg/day clomifene increased testosterone levels from 309 ng/dL to 642 ng/dL after three months of therapy. No significant changes in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, or prolactin levels were observed, although total cholesterol levels decreased significantly.

====Other activities====
Clomifene is an inhibitor of the conversion of desmosterol into cholesterol by the enzyme 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase. Concerns about possible induction of desmosterolosis and associated symptoms such as cataracts and ichthyosis with extended exposure precluded the use of clomifene in the treatment of breast cancer. Continuous use of clomifene has been found to increase desmosterol levels by 10% and continuous high doses of clomifene (200 mg/day) have been reported to produce visual disturbances.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Clomifene produces &quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphene, clomifenoxide (clomifene &quot;N&quot;-oxide), 4-hydroxyclomifene, and 4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphene as metabolites. Clomifene is a prodrug most importantly of 4-hydroxyclomifene and 4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphene, which are the most active of its metabolites. In one study, the peak levels after a single 50 mg dose of clomifene were 20.37 nmol/L for clomifene, 0.95 nmol/L for 4-hydroxyclomifene, and 1.15 nmol/L for 4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphene.

Clomifene has an onset of action of five to ten days following course of treatment and an elimination half-life about four to seven days. In one study, after a single 50 mg dose of clomifene, the half-life of clomifene was 128 hours (5.3 days), of 4-hydroxyclomifene was 13 hours, and of 4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphenewas 15 hours. Individuals with the CYP2D6*10 allele showed longer half-lives for 4-hydroxyclomifene and 4-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-desethylclomiphene. Primarily due to differences in CYP2D6 genetics, steady state concentrations and individual response to clomifene are highly variable.

Most clomifene metabolism occurs in the liver, where it undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. Clomifene and its metabolites are excreted primarily through feces (42%), and excretion can occur up to 6 weeks after discontinuation.

==Chemistry==
Clomifene is a triphenylethylene derivative. It is a mixture of two geometric isomers, the cis enclomifene (&quot;(E)&quot;-clomifene) form and trans zuclomifene (&quot;(Z)&quot;-clomifene) form. These two isomers contribute to the mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties of clomifene. The typical ratio of these isomers after synthesis is 38% zuclomiphene and 62% enclomiphene. The United States Pharmacopeia specifies that clomifene preparations must contain between 30% and 50% zuclomiphene.

==History==
A team at William S. Merrell Chemical Company led by Frank Palopoli synthesized clomifene in 1956; after its biological activity was confirmed a patent was filed and issued in November 1959. Scientists at Merrell had previously synthesized chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. Clomifene was studied in the treatment of advanced breast cancer during the period of 1964 to 1974 and was found to be effective but was abandoned due to concerns about desmosterolosis with extended use. Short-term use (e.g. days to months) did not raise the same concerns and clomifene continued to be studied for other indications.

Clinical studies were conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application; clomifene was third drug for which an IND had been filed under the 1962 Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that had been passed in response to the thalidomide tragedy. It was approved for marketing in 1967 under the brand name Clomid. It was first used to treat cases of oligomenorrhea but was expanded to include treatment of anovulation when women undergoing treatment had higher than expected rates of pregnancy.

The drug is widely considered to have been a revolution in the treatment of female infertility, the beginning of the modern era of assisted reproductive technology, and the beginning of what in the words of Eli Y. Adashi, was &quot;the onset of the US multiple births epidemic&quot;.

The company was acquired by Dow Chemical in 1980, and in 1989 Dow Chemical acquired 67 percent interest of Marion Laboratories, which was renamed Marion Merrell Dow. In 1995, Hoechst AG acquired the pharmaceutical business of Marion Merrell Dow. Hoechst in turn became part of Aventis in 1999, and subsequently a part of Sanofi. It became the most widely prescribed drug for ovulation induction to reverse anovulation or oligoovulation.

===Regulation===
Clomifene is included on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of illegal doping agents in sport. It is listed because it is an &quot;anti-estrogenic substance&quot;.

==Research==
Clomifene has been used almost exclusively for ovulation induction in premenopausal women, and has been studied very limitedly in postmenopausal women.

Clomifene was studied for treatment and prevention of breast cancer, but issues with toxicity led to abandonment of this indication, as did the discovery of tamoxifen. Like the structurally related drug triparanol, clomifene is known to inhibit the enzyme 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase and increase circulating desmosterol levels, making it unfavorable for extended use in breast cancer due to risk of side effects like irreversible cataracts.

<doc id="1085938" wikidata="Q37544" url="?curid=1085938" title="Romance copula">
<text>In some of the Romance languages the copula, the equivalent of the verb &quot;to be&quot; in English, is relatively complex compared to its counterparts in other languages. A copula is a word that links the subject of a sentence with a predicate (a subject complement). Whereas English has one main copula verb (and some languages like Russian mostly express the copula implicitly) some Romance languages have more complex forms.

Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and some other Romance languages have more than one copula verb. Conversely, French and certain others have only one. The development of copula verbs in Romance languages is explained by the fact that these are ultimately derived from three Latin verbs: 
*  &quot;to be&quot; (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &#x27;, as in English&#x27;). The verb &#x27; was an irregular, [[suppletion|suppletive verb]], with some of its forms (e.g.&#x27; &quot;I was/I have been&quot;) taken from the Proto-Indo-European root &#x27; meaning &quot;to become&quot; (as in English&#x27;).
*  &quot;to stand&quot; or &quot;to stay&quot; (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &#x27;, as in English&#x27; and German &quot;&quot;).
*  &quot;to sit&quot; (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &#x27;, as in English&#x27;). 

As the Romance languages developed over time, the three separate Latin verbs became just one or two verbs in the Romance languages.

The reduction of three separate verbs into just one or two appears to have occurred as follows:
*The irregular infinitive was remodeled into .
* and forms sounded similar in Latin once the latter reduced to , and sounded even more similar after stress shifted in Spanish infinitives to the penultimate vowel. As a result, parts of the conjugations of erstwhile were subject to being integrated into conjugation paradigms associated with , eventually .
* itself remained a separate verb, but (later ) and were similar in some meanings, so that, especially in the Western Romance languages, evolved into a second copula, with a meaning of &quot;to be (temporarily or incidentally)&quot;; was then narrowed to mean &quot;to be (permanently or essentially)&quot;.

The development of two copular verbs in this manner occurred most completely in Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan. In other languages, most usages of English &quot;to be&quot; are still translated by :
*In Italian, the infinitive &quot;essere&quot; continues Latin as existential &#x27;to be&#x27;, while &quot;stare&quot; has the primary meaning &quot;to stay&quot; and is used as a copula only in a few situations: to express one&#x27;s state of physical health (&quot;sto bene&quot; &quot;I am well&quot;); to form progressive aspects (&quot;sto parlando&quot; &quot;I am speaking&quot;); and (especially in the south of Italy) with the meaning of &quot;to be located&quot;, although a distinction can be expressed in most varieties of Italian: &quot;è in cucina&quot; &#x27;it&#x27;s in the kitchen (where it usually is)&#x27; versus &quot;sta in cucina&quot; &#x27;it&#x27;s in the kitchen (where it isn&#x27;t usually located)&#x27;. 
*In Old French, the verb &quot;ester&quot; &lt; maintained the Proto-Romance meaning of &quot;to stand, stay, stop&quot;. In modern French, this verb has almost totally disappeared (see below for the one exception), although the derivative verb of &quot;rester&quot; (&quot;to remain&quot;) exists, and some parts of the conjugation of &quot;ester&quot; have become incorporated into &quot;être&quot; &quot;to be&quot; &lt; . As a result of this complex evolution, even though French has a single verb for &quot;to be&quot; (&quot;être&quot;), its conjugation is highly irregular.

==History==

In English, it is possible to say &quot;there stands...&quot; instead of &quot;there is...&quot; in certain contexts. In Latin, too, it became common to eschew in favour of and say where things &quot;stood&quot; instead of where they &quot;were&quot;. With time, it became common to use this verb to express other states.

Today, Spanish, Galician, Portuguese, Catalan, and (to a lesser extent) Italian commonly use two copulas, one from each of the Latin verbs. The others use just one main copula, from .

There is also a notable tendency for a derivative of the supine of () to replace the past participle of verbs deriving from (which in Latin had no supine). Examples:
*Italian has &quot;stato&quot; as the past participle of not only &quot;stare&quot; but also &quot;essere&quot;, instead of the expected &quot;essuto&quot; (which, along with &quot;suto&quot;, we encounter only in mediaeval texts).
*Standard Catalan has &quot;estat&quot; as the past participle of not only &quot;estar&quot; but also &quot;ésser&quot;. However, many people use forms such as &quot;sigut&quot; or &quot;sét&quot;, which are considered also standard for colloquial speech.
*French has &quot;été&quot; as the past participle of &quot;être&quot;, which had a complex phonetic development like many words of the language: → /sˈtatu/ (Vulgar Latin) &gt; /esˈtæðo/ (Proto-Gallo-Romance) &gt; /esˈteθ/ (early Old French) &gt; /ehˈte/ (late Old French) &gt; /eːˈte/ (Middle French) &gt; /ete/ (Modern French).
;Notes
*Following the standard practice, Latin verbs are quoted here in the first person singular of the present indicative. In other words, is literally &quot;I am&quot;, rather than &quot;to be&quot;. Their infinitives were and .
*Although it is normal to use lower case when writing Latin in modern times, this article, dealing as it does with etymology, presents Latin in the capital letters used by the Romans, and modern innovations such as , , ligatures, macrons, and breves have been avoided.
* Only the basic simple tenses are given in the conjugation tables, but all languages below have also numerous compound tenses.

==Spanish==

===Spanish copulas===

The Spanish copulas are &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot;. The latter developed as follows:
: → *&quot;estare&quot; → &quot;estar&quot;

The copula &quot;ser&quot; developed from two Latin verbs. Thus its inflectional paradigm is a combination: most of it derives from (to be) but the present subjunctive appears to come from (to sit) via the Old Spanish verb &quot;seer&quot;.

E.g. derivation from :

: → &quot;sea&quot; (1st person singular, present tense, subjunctive mood)

Derivation from :

: → &quot;somos&quot; (1st person plural, present tense, indicative mood)

The infinitive (on which the modern future and conditional are based) could have derived from either or both:

: → &quot;èssere&quot; (as in Italian) → &quot;ésser&quot; (as in Catalan) → &quot;ser&quot;
: → *&quot;seder&quot; → &quot;seer&quot; → &quot;ser&quot;

In the early part of the second millennium, in texts such as the &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot;, &quot;ser&quot; was still used mostly as in Latin, and there was little place for &quot;estar&quot;; sentences like &quot;Es pagado, e davos su amor&quot;, &quot;He is satisfied, and he gives you his favour&quot; are found, where modern Spanish might have &quot;Queda contento,&quot; or &quot;Está satisfecho, y le da su favor&quot;.

As the centuries went by, &quot;estar&quot; spread in use. Today, &quot;ser&quot; is used to express the fundamental nature, identity, essence, or characteristics of something – what it &quot;really is&quot;, while &quot;estar&quot; expresses the state or condition something &quot;happens to be in&quot;. Indeed, &quot;ser&quot; is etymologically related to the English words &quot;essence&quot; and &quot;is&quot;, and &quot;estar&quot; with &quot;state&quot;, &quot;status&quot;, &quot;standing&quot;, &quot;stance&quot; and &quot;stay&quot;. The distinction is parallel with the concept of essence versus accident. 

The verb &quot;quedar&quot; (which also has the specific meanings of &quot;to remain&quot;, &quot;to be as a result&quot; and others) is often used in a similar way to &quot;estar&quot;. It derives from the Latin ( in the infinitive), &quot;to rest&quot;.

;Ser

;Estar

===Nuance===

:&quot;Él es sucio&quot; = &quot;He is dirty&quot; (i.e. &quot;He is a dirty person&quot; – characteristic)
:&quot;Él está sucio&quot; = &quot;He is dirty&quot; (i.e. &quot;He has some dirt on him&quot; – state)

:&quot;Es abierta&quot; = &quot;She is open&quot; (i.e. &quot;She is an open sort of person&quot; – characteristic)
:&quot;Está abierta&quot; = &quot;It is open&quot; (probably referring to a door or window – state)

:&quot;Es triste&quot; = &quot;[It/he/she] is sad&quot; (i.e. gloomy – characteristic)
:&quot;Está triste&quot; = &quot;[It/he/she] is sad&quot; (i.e. feeling down – state)

:&quot;¿Cómo eres?&quot; = &quot;What are you like?&quot; (i.e. &quot;describe yourself&quot; – characteristics)
:&quot;¿Cómo estás?&quot; = &quot;How are you?&quot; (i.e. &quot;how are you doing?&quot; – state)

With adjectives referring to beauty and the like, &quot;ser&quot; means &quot;to be&quot;, and &quot;estar&quot; means &quot;to look&quot;.
:&quot;¡Qué bonita es!&quot; = &quot;Wow, she is so beautiful&quot; (characteristic)
:&quot;¡Qué bonita está!&quot; = &quot;Wow, she is looking so beautiful / she is done up so nicely&quot; (state)

The differentiation between &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;state&quot; makes sense when talking about the states of life and death: &quot;Él está vivo&quot; (He is alive), &quot;Él está muerto&quot; (He is dead). &quot;Estar&quot; is used for both alive and dead, since they are both states, although being dead is considered a permanent state.

&quot;Ser&quot; is used when stating the stage of life at which a person is. The old, the young, etc. are seen as groups that one can belong to. It is a question of identity:
:&quot;Él es viejo&quot; = &quot;He is old&quot;
:&quot;Él es un viejo&quot; = &quot;He is an old man&quot;
:&quot;Cuando ella era niñita&quot; = &quot;When she was a little girl&quot;
However, age can also be presented not as a matter of identity but a state:
:&quot;Él está viejo&quot; = &quot;He is looking old&quot; / &quot;He got old&quot;

The use of &quot;estar&quot; gives a certain special nuance to some verbs. For example, &quot;estar guapa&quot;, though it has the sense of &quot;to be beautiful&quot;, also emphasizes the use of make-up and clothes to create a beautiful look. &quot;Ser sucio&quot; instead of the more usual &quot;estar sucio&quot; means to be the sort of person who is likely to be dirty.

The adjective &quot;loco&quot; (&quot;mad&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot;, &quot;insane&quot;) is always used with &quot;estar&quot; in Spain, as the implication is that the person &quot;has gone mad&quot; (i.e. a change of state). It is possible to give it a permanent nuance, but only by using it as a noun: &quot;Él es un loco&quot;, &quot;He is a madman&quot;. &quot;Ser loco&quot; is used in certain regions in Latin America, however, meaning a permanent insanity as opposed to &quot;estar loco&quot; meaning have gone mad or acting crazy.

The expression &quot;como una cabra&quot; (with the implied &quot;loco&quot; omitted) is used with &quot;estar&quot; to mean &quot;mad as a hatter&quot;, &quot;crazy as a loon&quot;. &quot;Ser como una cabra&quot; would literally mean, &quot;to be like a goat&quot;.

&quot;Ser&quot; is used with adjectives of fundamental belief, nationality, sex, intelligence, etc. The use of &quot;estar&quot; with &quot;francés&quot; (&quot;French&quot;) would sound quite odd to native Spanish speakers, as though it meant, &quot;to feel a bit French&quot;. Similarly, &quot;no estar católico&quot; does not mean, &quot;to no longer be Catholic&quot;, but is a colloquial expression meaning &quot;to feel under the weather&quot;.

It is often stated that the difference between the two verbs corresponds to &quot;permanent&quot; versus &quot;temporary&quot;, but it is more accurate to describe the distinction as one of &quot;essential nature&quot; versus &quot;state or condition&quot;. The &quot;essential nature&quot; of things does sometimes change, and this is reflected in the language. For example, someone who had been depressed for a prolonged period, and then had a life changing experience like a new career or long-term relationship, might say &quot;ahora yo soy feliz&quot;, meaning, &quot;now I am happy&quot;.

===Specific constructions requiring &quot;ser&quot;===
A special use of &quot;ser&quot;, which expresses neither a nature nor a state but an action, is the formation of the passive voice:
:&quot;Ellos han sido asesinados&quot; = &quot;They have been murdered&quot;
:&quot;Tú serás juzgada&quot; = &quot;You will be judged&quot;

===Specific constructions requiring &quot;estar&quot;===

====Past participles====

&quot;Estar&quot; is usually used with adjectives that derive from past participles of verbs since the use of &quot;ser&quot; would sound like a verb in the passive voice. Such adjectives in any case generally refer to states:
:&quot;La frontera está cerrada&quot; = &quot;The border is closed&quot;
:&quot;Estoy casado&quot; = &quot;I am married&quot; (&quot;Soy casado&quot; is also possible; &quot;I am single&quot;, &quot;I am widowed&quot;, etc. can use &quot;ser&quot; or &quot;estar&quot; as well)

A special example of this tendency is what happens with words indicating prohibition and suchlike. If an adjective not deriving from a verb were used, then the meaning would definitely require &quot;ser&quot;. To say the same thing with a past participle, &quot;estar&quot; (or &quot;quedar&quot;) is required, in order to differentiate it from the use of &quot;ser&quot; with a past participle implying an action expressed in the passive voice:
:&quot;Es ilegal fumar en este vuelo&quot; = &quot;It is illegal to smoke on this flight&quot; (straightforward case of &quot;ser&quot;)
:&quot;Está prohibido fumar en este vuelo&quot; = &quot;It is prohibited to smoke on this flight&quot; (&quot;estar&quot; necessary to distinguish the sentence from the following one)
:&quot;Ha sido prohibido fumar en este vuelo&quot; = &quot;It has been prohibited (i.e. made against the rules) to smoke on this flight&quot; (This is an example of the passive voice. This use of &quot;ser&quot; in the perfect tense is similar to the use of &quot;estar&quot; in the present tense; the former expressing an event in the past, the latter expressing its current effect.)

This fine nuance is not encountered in other Romance languages, which do not go to such lengths to distinguish between passives and similar-sounding phrases.

====Location====
&quot;Estar&quot; is used to refer to physical location. In Spanish, location is regarded as a state, and therefore is indicated with &quot;estar&quot;, even in those cases (e.g. &quot;Madrid está en España&quot; &quot;Madrid is in Spain&quot;) when one might think that it is something so permanent and fundamental that it could be logical to use &quot;ser&quot;. The use of &quot;estar&quot; for location may be easier for English speakers to grasp if they recall that it is derived from Latin , &quot;to stand.&quot;

With immobile things, &quot;quedar&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;estar&quot;, especially when there is a reference to a length of time, or a remaining distance, e.g.:
:&quot;¿A cuánto queda la playa?&quot; / &quot;¿A qué distancia queda la playa?&quot; = &quot;How far away is the beach?&quot;
:&quot;Aún queda lejos&quot; = &quot;There is still quite some way&quot; / &quot;It is still far&quot;
:&quot;El bar queda a cinco minutitos&quot; = &quot;The bar is five minutes away&quot;

However, &quot;ser&quot; can sometimes occur with words such as &quot;aquí&quot;, which can mislead learners into thinking that physical location can be expressed with &quot;ser&quot;. In fact, the verb in this case identifies the place rather than expressing where it is. For example, one might say to a taxi driver the following phrases, to indicate that one has arrived:
:&quot;Está aquí&quot; = &quot;It is here&quot;
:&quot;Es aquí&quot; = &quot;It is here&quot;

The difference becomes clear if &quot;aquí&quot; is changed to &quot;esta calle&quot;:
:&quot;Está en esta calle&quot; = &quot;It is in this street&quot;
:&quot;Es esta calle&quot; = &quot;It is this street&quot;

&quot;Es aquí&quot; and &quot;es esta calle&quot; express the idea that &quot;this is the place&quot;, a concept quite different from what is expressed by &quot;estar&quot;.

The only case in which true location is expressed by &quot;ser&quot; is when an event rather than a physical thing is referred to:
:&quot;¿Dónde es la fiesta?&quot; = &quot;Where is the party?&quot;
:&quot;¿Dónde está la discoteca?&quot; = &quot;Where is the nightclub?&quot;

===Words requiring &quot;ser&quot;===
&quot;Ser&quot; is always used when the complement is a noun or pronoun, regardless of whether the speaker intended to express a fundamental essence (though in practice speakers do tend to express this):
:&quot;Él es una persona sucia&quot; = &quot;He is a dirty person&quot;
:&quot;Ella es una persona abierta&quot; = &quot;She is an open person&quot;
:&quot;Yo soy la víctima&quot; = &quot;I am the victim&quot;

However, it is not always easy to know what is a noun. For example, &quot;pez&quot; is a noun meaning &quot;fish&quot;, but &quot;estar pez&quot; is a colloquial expression meaning &quot;not to have a clue&quot; or &quot;to be at sea&quot; at a given activity.

===Words requiring &quot;estar&quot;===

&quot;Estar&quot; must be used when the complement is &quot;bien&quot; or &quot;mal&quot;, no matter what meaning is intended.
:&quot;Este libro está muy bien&quot; = &quot;Este libro es muy bueno&quot; = &quot;This book is very good&quot; (nature)
:&quot;Estoy muy mal&quot; = &quot;Estoy muy malo&quot; = &quot;I am feeling terrible, ill&quot; (state)

===Total change of meaning with specific adjectives===
Many adjectives change in meaning entirely depending on the verb used, sometimes meaning almost the opposite. In each case, the meaning which is more of a &quot;nature&quot; goes with &quot;ser&quot; and the meaning which is more of a &quot;state&quot; goes with &quot;estar&quot;.
====Happiness====
Although &quot;sadness&quot; is expressed straightforwardly with &quot;estar triste&quot;, &quot;happiness&quot; is a little trickier. The quality of being joyous, lively and happy is expressed with &quot;ser alegre&quot;. This can describe people, music, colours, etc. &quot;Estar alegre&quot; expresses the state of being merry, which in practice may sometimes mean &quot;drunk&quot;, &quot;tipsy&quot;.

A person who is fundamentally happy in life is said to &quot;ser feliz&quot;; indeed &quot;la felicidad&quot; is that &quot;happiness&quot; for which humans strive. This happiness often turns out to be a transitory state, a person may nevertheless declare &quot;yo soy feliz&quot; as a statement of optimism that goes beyond the description of today&#x27;s mood that is expressed by any phrase with &quot;estar&quot;. As for such moods, they can be expressed with &quot;estar feliz&quot;.

When not a state but a change of state is referred to, the expression is &quot;quedar contento&quot; or &quot;alegrarse&quot;: &quot;Ella quedó muy contenta cuando yo le dije que ella había ganado&quot; = &quot;she was very glad when I told her that she had won&quot;; &quot;Yo me alegro de que vosotros hayáis llegado&quot; = &quot;I am glad that you (plural) have come&quot;.

In the excerpt from the &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot; above, one can see that &quot;to be happy&quot; a thousand years ago was &quot;ser pagado&quot; (meaning &quot;to be paid&quot; in current Spanish).

==Portuguese==

===Portuguese copulas===

The Portuguese copulas are &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot;. As in Spanish, &quot;estar&quot; derived from Latin / :
: → *&quot;estare&quot; → &quot;estar&quot;
The copula &quot;ser&quot; developed both from and . Thus its inflectional paradigm is a combination of these two Latin verbs: most tenses derive from and a few from . E.g. derivation from :
: → &quot;seer&quot; → &quot;ser&quot; (infinitive)
: → &quot;seja&quot; (1st person singular, present tense, subjunctive mood)
E.g. derivation from :
: → &quot;som&quot; → &quot;sou&quot; (1st pers. sing., present tense, indicative mood)
: → &quot;era&quot; (1st pers. sing., imperfect past tense, indicative mood)
: → &quot;fui&quot; (1st pers. sing., preterite tense, indicative mood)

;Ser
;Estar

=== Usage ===

The distinction between the two verbs is very similar to that of Catalan. Compared to Spanish, &quot;estar&quot; is a little less used. The main difference between Spanish and Portuguese lies in the interpretation of the concept of state versus essence and in the generalisations in some constructions. There is perhaps a little more of a concept of permanent versus temporary, rather than essence versus state. For example, unlike Spanish, Portuguese does not require &quot;estar&quot; with past participles; in this case, it follows the general rule regarding state/essence.
:&quot;A cadeira é&quot; [&quot;feita&quot;] &quot;de madeira&quot; = &quot;The chair is made of wood&quot;.
The word &quot;feita&quot;, &quot;made&quot;, is usually omitted.
:&quot;Eu sou casado&quot; = &quot;I am married&quot;.
The same applies to sentences expressing interdictions:
: &quot;É proibido fumar neste voo&quot; &quot;Smoking is forbidden on this flight&quot;.

However, there are some nuances in these verbs in the passive voice. In this case, the use of &quot;ser&quot; or &quot;estar&quot; depends on the tense of the verb. E.g.: to say that somebody is not allowed to smoke, only &quot;estar&quot; can be used in the present tense:
: &quot;Está proibido de fumar&quot; [&quot;pelo pai&quot;] = &quot;He has been forbidden from smoking [by his father]&quot;; literally &quot;He is forbidden to smoke [by the father]&quot;.
In past tenses, both &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot; can be used, conveying a different meaning:
: &quot;Foi proibido de fumar&quot; = &quot;He was forbidden from smoking&quot; [action].
: &quot;Estava proibido de fumar&quot; = &quot;He was forbidden from smoking&quot; [result].

Portuguese counts location as permanent and fundamental, and accordingly uses &quot;ser&quot;, or the more specific secondary copula &quot;ficar&quot; (to stay), from Latin , &quot;to place/set&quot;:
:&quot;Lisboa fica em Portugal&quot; &quot;Lisbon is [located] in Portugal&quot;.
:&quot;Onde é/fica o apartamento dela?&quot; &quot;Where is her flat/apartment?&quot;
but:
:&quot;A cidade está (situada) a 10 quilômetros da capital.&quot; &quot;The city is (situated) 10 km from the capital.&quot;

====Nuance====

:&quot;Como és?&quot; = &quot;What are you like?&quot; (i.e. &quot;Describe yourself&quot; – characteristics).
:&quot;Como estás?&quot; = &quot;How are you?&quot; (i.e. &quot;How are you doing?&quot; – state).

:&quot;Ele é triste&quot; = &quot;He is sad&quot; (i.e. gloomy – characteristic).
:&quot;(Ele) está triste&quot; = &quot;He is [feeling] sad&quot; (i.e. feeling down – state).

:&quot;Ela é aberta&quot; = &quot;She is open&quot; (i.e. &quot;She is an open-minded sort of person&quot; – characteristic; this sentence can also have a pejorative meaning).
:&quot;Ela está aberta&quot; = &quot;It is open&quot; (probably referring to a door or window – state).

:&quot;É sujo&quot; = &quot;It is dirty&quot; (i.e. &quot;It is a dirty place/thing&quot; – characteristic).
:&quot;Está sujo&quot; = &quot;It is dirty&quot; (i.e. &quot;The place is/looks dirty [now]&quot; – state).

With adjectives referring to beauty and the like, &quot;ser&quot; means &quot;to be&quot;, and &quot;estar&quot; means &quot;to look&quot;.
:&quot;Que linda ela é!&quot; = &quot;She is so beautiful!&quot; (characteristic).
:&quot;Que linda ela está!&quot; = &quot;She looks so beautiful!&quot; (state).

As in Spanish, the differentiation between &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;state&quot; makes sense when talking about the states of life and death: &quot;Está vivo&quot; (He is alive); &quot;Está morto&quot; (He is dead).
Notice the important difference between &quot;ser morto&quot; (to be killed) and &quot;estar morto&quot; (to be dead):
:&quot;Ele foi morto&quot; [&quot;por um ladrão&quot;] = &quot;He was killed [by a burglar]&quot;.

&quot;Louco&quot; (mad) can be used with &quot;ser&quot; or &quot;estar&quot;, giving different connotations:

:&quot;És louco!&quot; = &quot;You are mad!&quot; (characteristic).
:&quot;Estás louco!&quot; = &quot;You have gone mad!&quot;/ &quot;You are acting crazy&quot; (state).

&quot;Ser&quot; is used with adjectives expressing:
* fundamental belief: &quot;Não sou católico&quot; &quot;I am not a Catholic&quot;;
* nationality: &quot;És português&quot; &quot;You are Portuguese&quot;;
* gender: &quot;É um homem&quot; &quot;He is a man&quot;;
* intelligence: &quot;Somos espertos&quot; &quot;We are clever&quot;, etc.

&quot;Estar católico&quot; is used with the same sense as in Spanish:

:&quot;Eu não estou muito católico&quot; = &quot;I am not feeling very well&quot; (perhaps mean-spirited or ill or drunk).
:&quot;O tempo hoje não está muito católico&quot; = &quot;The weather is not very reliable today&quot;.

Apart from this exception, due to its different meanings, &quot;estar&quot; cannot be used for nationality, gender, or intelligence, but one can say &quot;Estou abrasileirado&quot; (I have acquired Brazilian ways – state) or &quot;Estás americanizado&quot; (You have been Americanised – state).
The same applies for the difference between &quot;É um homem&quot; &quot;He is a man&quot; and &quot;Está um homem&quot;, meaning, &quot;He has grown up to be a man&quot;.

&quot;Ficar&quot;, apart from its use as &quot;to stay&quot;, and the use mentioned above as a copula translated as &quot;to be located&quot;, is extensively used for a change of state (sometimes quite sudden), being translated as &quot;to get&quot; or &quot;to become&quot;:
: &quot;Fiquei rico&quot; = &quot;I got rich.&quot;
: &quot;Ficou triste&quot; = &quot;He became sad.&quot;

==Catalan==

===Catalan copulas===
The Catalan copulas developed as follows:
: → &quot;éssere&quot; → &quot;ésser&quot; → &quot;esser&quot; → &quot;ser&quot;
: → *&quot;estare&quot; → &quot;estar&quot;
: → &quot;seure&quot;

The last three forms of the first verb survive in modern Catalan. &quot;Ésser&quot; is considered the most standard, followed by &quot;ser&quot; and, distantly, &quot;esser&quot;. The verb &quot;seure&quot; remains as a distinct verb and is not considered a copula.


;Estar
===Usage===

In Catalan, &quot;ésser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot; work in a way intermediate between those of Italian and Portuguese. A complete description of its rules of usage is as follows:

* When referring to inanimate objects, &quot;ser&quot; is used to tell about either permanent conditions inherent to the object (for example &quot;és vermell&quot;, &quot;it is red&quot;), unfinished qualities, or non-permanent conditions when there is no implication that there has been or there will be a change in state (for example, &quot;la sopa és calenta&quot;, &quot;the soup is hot.&quot;) &quot;Ser&quot; is used to talk about a quality of an inanimate object in a given moment (without paying attention to other moments) or exactly the opposite: a quality of an inanimate object which is expected to be true in all moments of the existence of said object. Most uses of past participles as adjectives fall into this category when referring to inanimate objects.
* When referring to inanimate objects, &quot;estar&quot; is used to tell about non-permanent conditions when there is an implication of a finished change of state, an implication of a state in a known point of an evolution, or a temporal condition which is expected to change. In some way, &quot;estar&quot; introduces an adverbial sense to adjectives (for example, &quot;la sopa està calenta&quot;, &quot;the soup is hot&quot;, as in &quot;it has come to be hot.&quot;) Thus, both using &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot; is correct in many contexts, but there is a difference in nuance.
* When referring to animate objects, &quot;ser&quot; is only used to tell about permanent conditions (for example &quot;és boig&quot;, &quot;he is insane&quot;; &quot;és mort&quot;, &quot;he is dead.&quot;) Things traditionally thought of as permanent conditions also fall under this category, most notably &quot;ser casat/da&quot;, &quot;to be married&quot;, and related terms. &quot;Ser&quot; is also used with the past participle of some unaccusative verbs such as &quot;néixer&quot;, which in medieval and dialectal Catalan made their compound tenses with &quot;ser&quot;.
* When referring to animate objects, &quot;estar&quot; is only used to tell about non-permanent conditions (for example &quot;estàs molt guapa&quot;, &quot;you look good&quot; as in &quot;better than usual.&quot;)
* With fixed prepositional locutions, &quot;estar&quot; is most often used (for example, &quot;està en perill&quot;, &quot;he/she/it is in danger&quot;; &quot;està a punt&quot;, &quot;he/she/it is ready.&quot;)
* When referring to location, &quot;ser&quot; is used when no time context is given (for example, &quot;els llibres són als prestatges&quot;, &quot;the books are on the shelves.&quot;)
* When referring to location, &quot;estar&quot; is used when there is a sense of permanence (for example &quot;estic a Barcelona&quot;, &quot;I live in Barcelona&quot;) or of a concrete time lapse (for example &quot;hi vam estar dues hores&quot;, &quot;we were there for two hours.&quot;) In this case, pronominal particles might be added to the verb to emphasise the sentence (for example, &quot;ens hi vam estar dues hores.&quot;)
* &quot;Estar&quot; is always used with modal adverbs (for example &quot;estic bé&quot;, &quot;I am all right&quot;).
* &quot;Estar&quot; is used to form the present continuous form &quot;estar&quot; + gerund, although some linguists think this is not a genuinely Catalan form, even though it is found on Medieval literature, for example that of Ausiàs March. Another undoubtedly genuine but perhaps too literary form is &quot;ser a&quot; + infinitive.
* &quot;Estat&quot; is used as the past participle of not only &quot;estar&quot; but also &quot;èsser/ser&quot; by many speakers, and this is considered the universal form. However, many other speakers use a traditional regular past participle of &quot;èsser/ser&quot;: &quot;sigut&quot;, which is also accepted as standard in Central Catalan, although many linguists and speakers see it as colloquial. Another accepted form is &quot;sét&quot;, unlike the Valencian form &quot;segut&quot;, which causes confusion with the past participle of the verb &quot;seure&quot;, &quot;to sit.&quot;

This can be summed up in five simple rules:

# &quot;Ser&quot; is always used to apply adjectives to inanimate objects except if there is a cause or a time lapse given for the condition of the adjective.
# &quot;Estar&quot; is always used to apply adjectives to animate objects if it is not a permanent state or characteristic of such animate object. However, there are some things that nowadays can be changed but before could not (or were not expected to), which work like permanent characteristics (for example, nationality, beliefs, sex, looks, being married, degree of intelligence and degree of sanity.) Of course, even those can be expressed with &quot;estar&quot; if the animate object is acting as if they were his characteristics but they are not, or if the characteristics are more emphasised than usual. For example, &quot;és molt socialista&quot;, &quot;she/he&#x27;s a convinced socialist&quot; vs. &quot;estàs molt socialista!&quot;, &quot;you are being very socialist!&quot;; &quot;és molt maca&quot;, &quot;she is very beautiful&quot; vs. &quot;està molt maca&quot;, &quot;she looks very beautiful&quot;, as in &quot;better than usual&quot;; &quot;és mort&quot;, &quot;he is dead&quot; vs. &quot;està com mort&quot;, &quot;he is acting as if he were dead.&quot;
# &quot;Ser&quot; is always used for locations except if there is a time lapse given or if the location actually means that someone works or lives in the indicated place.
# &quot;Estar&quot; is always used with modal adverbs and equivalents like fixed prepositional locutions.
# &quot;Estar&quot; is always used to express a point of an evolution or scale (for example, &quot;els termòmetres estan a 20 graus&quot;, &quot;thermometers are at 20 degrees.&quot;)

&quot;Animate objects&quot; refers mainly to people, animals, and whatever is thought to be sentient (for example, a child playing with a doll will probably treat it as an animate object).

==Italian==

===Italian copulas===
The Italian copulas did not undergo the same development as in other languages, having preserved the Vulgar Latin forms &quot;essere&quot; and &quot;stare&quot;.

;Essere
;Stare
=== Usage ===

&quot;Essere&quot; is the main copula. &quot;Stare&quot; refers to state rather than essence, but more narrowly than in Spanish. &quot;Essere&quot; is used for almost all cases in which English uses &quot;to be&quot;. It therefore makes sense to concentrate on the few uses of &quot;stare&quot;.
*&quot;Stare&quot; means &quot;to be&quot;, &quot;to be feeling&quot;, or &quot;to appear&quot; with &quot;bene&quot;, &quot;male&quot;, &quot;meglio&quot;, &quot;come?&quot;, etc.: &quot;Come stai?&quot; &quot;How are you?&quot;, &quot;Sto bene&quot; &quot;I am well.&quot;
*&quot;Stare&quot; is used to form continuous forms of tenses: &quot;sto aspettando&quot; &quot;I am waiting&quot;, &quot;Stavo parlando con...&quot; &quot;I was speaking with...&quot;
*&quot;Stare&quot;&#x27;s past participle &quot;stato&quot; has replaced that of &quot;essere&quot;, and so &quot;stato&quot; is used for &quot;been&quot; in all senses.
*&quot;Starci&quot; (lit. &quot;To stay in it&quot;) means &quot;to fit&quot; or &quot;to assent to a proposal.&quot;
*&quot;Stare&quot; can be an alternative to &quot;restare&quot; &quot;to stay.&quot;
*&quot;Stare&quot; is occasionally &quot;to be located.&quot; This is very common in the south of Italy for both transient and durable location, but only for durable location in the North. &quot;Sta a Napoli&quot; means &quot;He/she is in Naples&quot; in the South but &quot;He/she lives in Naples&quot; in the North.

Like the Spanish &quot;quedar&quot;, Italian uses &quot;rimanere&quot;, from Latin (both meaning &quot;to remain&quot;), in the sense of &quot;to be as a result&quot;; e.g. &quot;È rimasta incinta&quot; = &quot;she became pregnant (as a result)&quot;.

==Sicilian==

===Sicilian copulas===
The Sicilian copulas developed as follows:
: → &quot;èssere&quot; → &quot;(es)sere&quot; → &quot;siri&quot;
: → &quot;stare&quot; → &quot;stari&quot;

;Siri
;Stari

;Notes

#The simple future is no longer in use.
#The conditional tense of &quot;stari&quot; has also fallen into disuse.

=== Usage ===

In Sicilian, the meanings and usages of these two copulas are not as broad as in the other languages. &quot;Siri&quot; is the dominant copula, even more so than in the other Romance languages and is used for almost all cases in which English uses “to be”. &quot;Stari&quot; has been relegated to only a few common uses:

*&quot;Stari&quot; is used in combination with the gerund to form the progressive aspect: = &quot;I am speaking&quot;.
*&quot;Stari&quot;’s past participle, &quot;statu&quot;, replaced that of &quot;siri&quot; and thus &quot;statu&quot; is used for “been” in all senses.
*&quot;Stari&quot; has also replaced all other words meaning, &quot;to reside&quot;: = &quot;I live in the United States&quot;.
*&quot;Stari&quot;, in combination with &quot;addritta&quot;, is also used to mean, “to stand up”.
*&quot;Stari&quot; in combination with the preposition &quot;pi&quot; can comport two meanings,
** 1) when followed by a verb it means “about to” or “ready to”: = &quot;I am about to go&quot;, &quot;I am leaving&quot;; and
** 2) in reference to an abbreviation, it means, “to stand for”: &quot;«USA» sta pi Stati Uniti di Mèrica&quot; = &quot;&#x27;USA&#x27; stands for United States of America.&quot;
*&quot;Stari-cci&quot;, most likely an Italianism, is sometimes used to mean, “to fit”: = &quot;does this suit fit me [well]?&quot; (cf. Italian &quot;non ci sto&quot; &#x27;I don&#x27;t fit in here/there&#x27;).

&quot;Siri&quot; is no longer in use as an auxiliary verb. &quot;Aviri&quot; has completely replaced it in all verbs.

==Occitan==
Occitan has just one copula, estre; which is also written èsser, ester, estar in diverse dialects.

;Estre
==French==

Modern French has only one copula. Old French, however, had &quot;estre&quot; ( → &quot;essere&quot; → *&quot;essre&quot; → &quot;estre&quot;) and &quot;ester&quot; ( → *&quot;estare&quot; → &quot;estar&quot; → &quot;ester&quot;). The latter meant to ‘stand’, ‘stay’ or ‘stop’, and might have been used as a copula in a similar way to other Romance languages. With phonetic evolution, the forms of each verb tended to be confused with one another, with the result that &quot;estre&quot; finally absorbed &quot;ester&quot;; around the same time, most words beginning with &quot;est-&quot; changed to &quot;ét-&quot; or &quot;êt-&quot;. The modern form of the verb is &quot;être&quot;.

The only clear traces of &quot;ester&quot; (or &quot;éter&quot; if we bear in mind the loss of the &quot;s&quot;) in the modern copula are the past participle and the imperfect. Instead of the *&quot;étu&quot; one would expect, we find &quot;été&quot; – just what we would expect from &quot;ester&quot;/&quot;éter&quot;. The same tendency to use past participles derived from (the supine of ) to replace the past participles of the main copula is also seen in Italian and Catalan. The Old French imperfect was &quot;iere&quot; (from Latin ); this was replaced in Middle French by the imperfect of &quot;ester&quot;, which was &quot;estois&quot; (from Vulgar Latin *&quot;estaba&quot;, Latin ).

The present participle and all imperfect forms of &quot;être&quot; are regular and correspond to what one would expect for a verb with the stem &quot;êt-&quot;; however, they could also be considered as deriving from &quot;éter&quot; since the forms coincide.

All other forms of &quot;être&quot; are from rather than .

&quot;Ester&quot; also survives in the infinitive in the set phrases &quot;ester en justice&quot; and &quot;&quot;, which translate the Latin term meaning &quot;to appear in court&quot;, &quot;to stand before the court&quot;. &quot;Ester en justice&quot; has come to mean, &quot;to act in a lawsuit&quot;, i.e. to appear in court as a party. This is a highly defective verb and mostly exists in the infinitive, although present and past participle are infrequently used as well.

;Être

== Romansh ==

Romansh has just one copula, &quot;esser&quot;. &quot;Star&quot; means, &quot;to reside&quot;.

;Esser
==Romanian==
&quot;A fi, fire&quot; is the copula in Romanian. These infinitive forms evolved from the passive verb , &quot;to become&quot;, &quot;to be made&quot;:

: → &quot;fiere&quot; → &quot;fire&quot; → *&quot;fir&quot; → &quot;fi&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;)

In Latin was used suppletively as the passive voice of &quot;to do&quot;, &quot;to make&quot;. However, in the Vulgar Latin dialects spoken in modern-day Romania, its evolved form &quot;fiere&quot; replaced &quot;essere&quot;, maybe due to the similarity between the stems &quot;fi-&quot; of and &quot;fu-&quot; of (which is not coincidental, as both stems descend from the Proto-Indo-European verb &quot;*bʰuH-&quot;).

Other forms of the verb &quot;a fi&quot; are derived from : &quot;sunt, ești, , suntem, sunteți, sunt&quot; in the present tense and &quot;eram, erai, era, eram, erați, erau&quot; in the imperfect.

&quot;A sta&quot; (stare) ( → &quot;sta&quot;) means &quot;to stay&quot; or even &quot;to stand&quot;, &quot;to stand still&quot; or &quot;to dwell/reside&quot; e.g. &quot;a sta in picioare&quot;, as in Italian &quot;stare in piedi&quot; or &quot;unde stai?&quot; – &quot;where do you live/reside?&quot;

<text>Nikki Cox (born )is an American actress, known for her roles on the television series &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;The Norm Show&quot;, and &quot;Nikki&quot;.

== Career ==
Cox began her career at the age of four, when she appeared as a dancer in several ballet productions and TV specials. She began acting at the age of ten, making appearances in several movies and guest-starring on shows such as &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, &quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot;, and &quot;Blossom&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1993 to 1995, and had a recurring role on the Saturday morning program &quot;California Dreams&quot;.

Her appearances on various TV shows led to her first prime-time role as Tiffany Malloy on the sitcom &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot;, which ran on The WB from 1995 to 1999 for a total of five seasons. Her brother Matthew guest-starred on a handful of episodes, including one where he wore a &quot;Ghostface&quot; mask (the type of mask featured in &quot;Scream&quot;).

After &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot; was cancelled (she appeared in all 100 episodes), Cox went on to portray Taylor Clayton, a former call-girl turned social worker on the ABC television sitcom &quot;The Norm Show&quot; which lasted for three seasons (she appeared in 27 of its 54 episodes). Next she starred as Nikki White in &quot;Nikki&quot;, another sitcom vehicle that lasted for two seasons on The WB (2000–2002).

The most successful show Cox co-starred in following her time on &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot; was on the NBC TV drama &quot;Las Vegas&quot; from 2003 to 2007 for a total of four seasons. She played Mary Connell for 88 episodes. However, Cox would not appear on the fifth and final season of the show. On May 20 and 23, 2005, her &quot;Las Vegas&quot; character crossed over to NBC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Passions&quot; to coincide with the arrival of two new characters introduced on &quot;Las Vegas&quot;.

In 2006, she became the spokesmodel for the online gaming website Sportsbook.com. In 2009, she provided the voice of Jenna in &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust&quot;. That same year, she also appeared in &quot;Lonely Street&quot;, a comedy, starring Robert Patrick, Jay Mohr, Ernie Hudson, and Lindsay Price. In 2016, Cox was nominated as the sole writer for Mohr&#x27;s album &quot;Happy. And A Lot&quot; for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.

== Personal life ==
Cox dated co-star Kevin Connolly from &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot; while the two were on the show. In 1997, she was engaged to Bobcat Goldthwait, 16 years her senior, who voiced the character of Mr. Floppy on that same show.

On December 29, 2006, she married comedian/actor Jay Mohr in Los Angeles. The two met on the set of &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. In December 2008, Mohr petitioned a Los Angeles court to allow him to legally add her last name to his, changing his name to Jon Ferguson Cox Mohr. Cox and Mohr have a son. On the May 16, 2017, episode of &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot;, Mohr confirmed that he and Cox were &quot;in the middle&quot; of a divorce. Their divorce was finalized in August 2018.

<doc id="1085971" wikidata="Q7111327" url="?curid=1085971" title="Ouse Bridge (M62)">
<text>The Ouse Bridge is a reinforced concrete plate girder bridge that spans River Ouse between Goole and Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It carries the M62 and is situated between junctions 36 and 37. It was built between 1973 and 1976 by Costain and was designed by Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick &amp; Partners. The bridge was officially opened to traffic on 24 May 1976 by nine-year-old Martin Brigham.

==History==
Traffic to and from Hull to the A1 historically went over Boothferry Bridge, on the A614, which was a swing bridge.

The position of the bridge and the M62 resulted from a study carried out in 1964 by Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick &amp; Partners. They would also design the bridge. It is a haunched girder bridge.

===Regional position===
The extension of the M18 (from the current M180), the M62, and the first part of (what would become) the M180 (to Scunthorpe only) was announced in Hull in September 1965. At that time, it would be five years before the M62 would cross the Pennines, and the Humber Bridge would not be given firm funding until the 1966 Kingston upon Hull North by-election in January 1966. The extension of the M180 would also require a similar bridge over the Trent which, like the Ouse Bridge, was the final part of that motorway section to open (in 1979, three years later). The Humber Bridge began construction (on the south-side embankment) in July 1972, and the Ouse Bridge followed only six months later; both were being built at the same time, and the Humber Bridge opened five years after the Ouse Bridge. Costain built the southern approach road from the Humber Bridge to the A1077 at the same time as the Ouse Bridge, including a viaduct with seven concrete box spans. Both sides of the Humber and Ouse would be linked in February 1977. At the time of opening of the Ouse Bridge, the Humber Bridge was projected to cost £40 million, and to be completed by 1978. The M18 was projected, at the time, to open by mid-1978, but opened in February 1979.

===Design===
In the early stages an immersed tube tunnel was considered, which was thought to be too expensive. The superstructure was designed by Redpath Dorman Long and G Maunsell &amp; Partners. of the River Ouse had to be bridged. The area was in the Boothferry district of Humberside. The gradient of the road on the approach to the bridge is 1 in 33.

==Construction==

The Ouse Bridge Contract for £6.75 million (£ million in ) was awarded on Friday 5 January 1973 to a consortium of Costain Civil Engineering and Redpath Dorman Long. At that time there were 76 miles of M62 from Tarbock to Ferrybridge. 

A box girder was asked for, but the consortium submitted a plate girder instead. A box girder design was not chosen due to recent accidents, and an inquiry by the Institution of Structural Engineers.

7,000 tons of steel came from RDL plants in Teesside and Scunthorpe. There were steel supply problems. The embankment started construction on Monday 22 January 1973. Main construction started on Saturday 1 April 1973, by the 2,000 ton American floating crane &#x27;Big R&#x27;, with a 180-ft-high jib, which could lift 100 tons; the ship was built in 1961 for the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel. Bob Adams from Virginia and John Anderson from Portland Oregon worked on the bridge for Raymond Concrete Pile Company subsidiary. There were 120 large steel cylinder piles of diameter and long driven into the ground by a self-elevating platform barge with a steam hammer.

For the concrete, sand came from Pollington and also PFA from nearby coal power stations. There were 96 piles in the river. 

Steel erection of girders was to begin in December 1973, but started in October 1974. The roadway was supported by a lattice of girders from the beams.

On Sunday 20 July 1975 three 86-ton 100-ft girders on the centre pier in the river slipped, with a partial collapse of a military trestle on pier 15.

The last section was fitted at 2pm on Tuesday 14 October 1975
===Opening===
It was opened on 24 May 1976 by nine-year-old Martin Brigham, who had been handed the scissors at the last moment by Minister of Transport John Gilbert, Baron Gilbert, who was to have opened it. It was the last section of the main part of the M62 to open, comprising . The M62 had taken 15 years and cost £190 million. The A63 Caves Bypass and M62 Balkholme sections (built by Clugston Construction) had opened on 19 February 1976. The Balkholme to Caves section was the first use on a UK motorway of continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP), which has no transverse joints.

===Repair===
In 2022, a partial failure of a joint on the eastbound carriageway was identified after it was discovered that increased vibration from traffic had started to damage the concrete under lane three and a bridge joint, which allows the carriageway to expand and contract with the weather. Temporary bridging plates were installed over the damaged bridge joints as a temporary mitigation measure, followed by the critically damaged joints on the eastbound carriageway being replaced by spring 2023. It was then delayed to reopen in August 2024 which has since been delayed again till further notice.

<text>Brooke Louise Hanson, OAM (born 18 March 1978) is an Australian former competitive swimmer, Olympic gold medallist, world champion, and former world record-holder.

==Swimming career==
A swimmer since the age of four, Hanson was the youngest swimmer on the Australian national team at the 1994 Commonwealth Games, where she finished fourth in the 200-metre breaststroke. However, she would not qualify for another major international competition for eight years, until she qualified for the 100- and 200-metre breaststroke at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. At the 2003 World Aquatics Championships, she would finish second in the 50-metre breaststroke and sixth in the 100-metre breaststroke.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Hanson won a gold medal as part of the Australian 4×100-metre medley relay team by swimming the breaststroke leg in a preliminary heat (Leisel Jones swam the breaststroke leg in the final). Jones&#x27; selection was the source of much discussion, and rumours spread of conflict between the two. She also won silver in the 100-metre breaststroke, finishing 0.01s ahead of Jones.

Several weeks later, Hanson competed at the 2004 FINA Short Course World Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana. Most of the medal-winners from the recently finished Olympics chose not to attend which allowed Hanson to win six gold medals, five of which were for individual events.

2005 was a difficult year for Hanson. She was defeated by both Jade Edmistone and Leisel Jones in the 50- and 100-metre breaststroke at the Australian Championships. At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Hanson missed the medals in both the 100-metre breaststroke and the 200-metre individual medley, but claimed bronze in the 50-metre breaststroke.

She admitted after the 2006 Commonwealth Games trials that she had been close to retiring. She missed qualification for the 50- and 100-metre breaststroke events, where the three positions were claimed by Jones, Edmistone and Tarnee White respectively. She qualified for the 200 m breaststroke and individual medley, and claimed silver in the latter event behind young teammate Stephanie Rice.

She swims with the Nunawading Swimming Club in Melbourne.

== Career after swimming ==
In 2006, she joined the health and lifestyle program &quot;What&#x27;s Good For You&quot; team and was a presenter in the second series of the show. At the 2007 Logies, she was nominated for Most Popular Female New Talent for her role in the show.

In 2008, she auditioned unsuccessfully for &quot;Gladiators&quot; on the Seven Network.

== Personal life ==
On 17 June 2007, Hanson was taken to hospital after collapsing after an apparent electric shock after climbing out of a spa at a pool and spa show in Melbourne. An investigation by Energy Safe Victoria found no fault with the spa.

Hanson is married to Jared Clarke and they have four children. Their son Jack died in 2012 at nine months of age due to chronic lung disease.

<doc id="1085977" wikidata="Q1267104" url="?curid=1085977" title="Bureau of Prohibition">
<text>The Bureau of Prohibition (or Prohibition Unit) was the United States federal law enforcement agency with the responsibility of investigating the possession, distribution, consumption, and trafficking of alcohol and alcoholic beverages in the United States of America during the Prohibition era. The enumerated enforcement powers of this organization were vested in the Volstead Act. Federal Prohibition Agents of the Bureau were commonly referred to by members of the public and the press of the day as &quot;Prohis,&quot; or &quot;Dry Agents.&quot; In the sparsely populated areas of the American west, agents were sometimes called &quot;Prohibition Cowboys.&quot; At its peak, the Bureau employed 2,300 dry agents.

== History ==

=== Volstead Act and formation in the Department of the Treasury ===

==== Prohibition Unit ====
The Prohibition Unit was formed to enforce the National Prohibition Act of 1919 (Volstead Act) which enforced the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution regarding the prohibition of the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. When it was first established in 1920, it was a unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Daniel C. Roper, strenuously objected to absorbing the responsibilities of managing a prohibition organization, as he believed they were beyond the scope and mandate of his Bureau which had primarily been responsible for investigating tax violations.

Initially, there were 960 dry agents in the Prohibition Unit.

==== Elevation to Bureau status ====
House Resolution 10729, passed by the 69th Congress, became law on March 3, 1927 and simultaneously created two new bureaus out of Treasury&#x27;s efforts: the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Prohibition. The new bureau would consist of a Commissioner of Prohibition, an assistant commissioner, two deputy commissioners, a chief clerk, and their staffs. On April 1, 1927, with 10729 becoming effective, the organizational restructuring was officially completed, and prohibition was elevated from Unit status to Bureau status.

=== Transfer to the Department of Justice ===
On July 1, 1930, the Prohibition Bureau was transferred from the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice (DOJ).

=== Mission ===
The Bureau of Prohibition&#x27;s main function was to stop the sale and consumption of alcohol. Agents would be tasked with eliminating illegal bootlegging rings, and became notorious in cities like New York and Chicago for raiding popular nightclubs.

Agents were often paid low wages, and the Bureau was notorious for allowing many uncertified people to become agents. Doing so strengthened the bureau, as they were able to hire agents in greater numbers.

In 1929, the Increased Penalties Act (Jones Law) increased penalties for violations previously set in the Volstead Act. First time offenders were now expected to serve a maximum of five years and a $10,000 fine as opposed to the previous six months and $1,000 fine. This strengthened animosity toward Prohibition agents, as many of them (such as Major Maurice Campbell, Prohibition administrator of New York City), were already hated for their raids on popular clubs frequented by New York City&#x27;s elite.

=== Transfer to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ===
Early in 1933, with the repeal of Prohibition imminent, as part of the Omnibus Crime Bill, the Bureau was briefly absorbed into the Bureau of Investigation (BOI). The Prohibition Bureau was demoted from Bureau status to Unit status and became the FBI&#x27;s Alcohol Beverage Unit (ABU). Though part of the FBI on paper, J. Edgar Hoover, who wanted to avoid liquor enforcement and the taint of corruption that was attached to it, continued to operate it as a separate, autonomous agency in practice.

=== Repeal of Prohibition and dissolution ===
In December 1933, once repeal became a reality and the only federal laws regarding alcoholic beverages were limited to their taxation, the ABU was removed from the FBI and the DOJ and returned to Treasury, where it became the Alcohol Tax Unit, ultimately evolving into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF).

== Leadership and organization ==

=== Directors of Prohibition, Internal Revenue ===
Prior to the 1st of April 1927, the chief duties for leadership of prohibition enforcement and investigation were vested in the Director of the Prohibition Unit.
* James E. Jones
* John H. Kramer

=== Commissioners ===
After April 1927, with the elevation of the Prohibition Unit to the Bureau of Prohibition, the chief administrator of the organization was the Commissioner of Prohibition.
* Acting Prohibition Commissioner Roy Asa Haynes
* Prohibition Commissioner James M. Doran
* Prohibition Commissioner Henry W. Anderson

=== District headquarters offices ===
In the summer of 1925, the 48 state enforcement districts were abolished and replaced with 22 federal prohibition districts, closely aligned with the Federal Judicial districts. This number would grow by 1929 to 27 districts.

Offices not seen above:
* Twenty-Third District, Honolulu, Hawaii
* Twenty-Fourth District, San Juan, Puerto Rico

== Narcotics Division ==

With the establishment of the Prohibition Unit in 1920, leadership established a Narcotics Division with the enumerated powers to investigate all violations of the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, taking over the duties of investigations and enforcement from the agents of Revenue&#x27;s Miscellaneous Division. Narcotics Agents and Narcotics Inspectors in these early days primarily were responsible for investigating medical licenses for the distribution of narcotics, but their duties evolved over the course of the decade. Narcotics Agents overall secured more convictions to federal prison for Harrison Act violations than their Dry Agent counterparts did for Volstead Act violations.

In the single fiscal year of 1920, more than half a million dollars were budgeted for narcotics enforcement. The requirements for entry into the Narcotics Division were far more stringent than for their dry agent counterparts; narcotics recruits were required to have an accredited bachelor&#x27;s degree in pharmacology or medicine.

=== Deputy Commissioner for Narcotics ===

Levi Nutt developed the Narcotics Division - sometimes called the Narcotics Field force prior to 1927, and was appointed the position of Assistant Commissioner for Narcotics. His position would absorb the dual capacity as Secretary of the Federal Narcotics Control Board with its establishment in 1922. He was a registered pharmacist, who had worked with Treasury since 1900. He led the Division to the arrest of tens of thousands of drug addicts and dealers in the 1920s. After 1927, with the elevation of Prohibition to Bureau status, he was promoted to Deputy Commissioner for Narcotics.

==== Rothstein Scandal ====
Nutt&#x27;s biological son Rolland Nutt and son-in-law L. P. Mattingly were attorneys for racketeer and gangster Arnold Rothstein in tax matters. After an investigation into the relationship, in 1930 a grand jury found no criminal impairment of Narcotics Division activities, but Nutt lost his position as chief of the Narcotics Division.
==== Anslinger ====
Harry J. Anslinger assumed his duties as the Assistant Commissioner for Narcotics. On July 1, 1930, the Narcotics Division would be merged into the newly established Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) under the leadership of Anslinger, the first United States Commissioner of Narcotics. Anslinger remained the Commissioner of Narcotics until his retirement in 1965. The FBN is considered a predecessor to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

=== Prohibition Service fallen officers ===
The first narcotics agent to lose his life in the line of duty was Charles Wood, fatally shot in the back after a two-hour gunfight following a whiskey raid in El Paso, Texas.
=== Narcotics Field Divisions ===
The Narcotics Division consisted of between 100 - 300 Narcotics Agents and Inspectors based out of 15 Narcotics Field Divisions;

== Industrial Alcohol and Chemical Division ==
In 1925, the Industrial Alcohol and Chemical Division was headed by James M. Doran.

With the Prohibition Reorganization Act of 1930, this division was elevated to Bureau status and became the Bureau of Industrial Alcohol.

== Audit Division ==
In 1925, the Audit Division was headed by J.M. Young.

== Famous agents ==
=== The Untouchables ===

The most famous dry agent of the bureau was undoubtedly the &quot;Untouchable&quot; Eliot Ness. The group of agents that Ness oversaw, &quot;The Untouchables,&quot; were by far the most famous group of prohibition agents. Ness was overseen by the northwest district administrator, Malachi Harney, based out of the Chicago Prohibition Office. Their fame resulted from their investigation to capture and arrest the infamous Chicago gangster Al Capone. They earned their nickname after members of the Chicago Outfit repeatedly failed to bribe or intimidate them, proving they were not as easily corrupted as other prohibition agents. Through their efforts, Capone was indicted on 5000 separate counts of conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act, though it was ultimately decided not to bring these charges to trial, but rather to concentrate on income tax violations. Nevertheless, the Untouchables gained national acclaim, in particular, Eliot Ness, who ran the group.

=== Georgia Hopley ===
The first female prohibition agent was Georgia Hopley. In early 1922, Hopley was sworn in as a general agent, serving under Federal Prohibition Commissioner Roy A. Haynes. Her appointment made news around the country. Her hiring encouraged local law enforcement agencies to hire more women to investigate women bootleggers.

=== Frank Hamer ===
Frank Hamer was an American lawman and Texas Ranger who led the 1934 posse that tracked down and killed criminals Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. His service in the Bureau of Prohibition was brief but eventful while stationed in El Paso, the scene of countless gunfights during the Prohibition era. He participated in numerous raids and shootouts, and he was involved in a gun battle with smugglers on March 21 which resulted in the death of Prohibition Agent Ernest W. Walker. Hamer transferred to Austin in 1921, where he served as Senior Ranger Captain.

=== Tom Threepersons ===
Tom Threepersons was an American lawman, who claimed to be the son of a Cherokee chief. He is considered to have been one of the last of gunfighters of the Old West. He invented the &quot;Tom Threepersons holster.&quot; In 1916, he joined the U.S. Army, and served under General Jack Pershing in pursuit of Pancho Villa in Mexico. He was later assigned to Fort Bliss on the Texas–New Mexico state line. On June 10, 1922, Threepersons was appointed as a Prohibition Agent for El Paso, where he worked for 90 days.

=== Two-Gun Hart ===

Ironically, while Chicago gangster Al Capone was one of the biggest targets of investigation for the dry agents of the Chicago prohibition office and their Untouchables, Capone&#x27;s eldest biological brother was himself a dry agent, or &quot;prohibition cowboy&quot;. Richard James &quot;Two-Gun&quot; Hart, born James Vincenzo Capone, had lost communication with his family at age 16 after fleeing New York City following a gang brawl. Hart kept his familial relationship a secret from most of his coworkers.

=== Izzy and Moe ===
The two-agent team of Isidor &quot;Izzy&quot; Einstein and Moe Smith, working out of the New York City office, compiled the best arrest record in the history of the agency. Izzy and Moe, as they would later be called, had 4,932 arrests while confiscating over five million bottles of alcohol. The duo would disguise themselves as street vendors, fishermen and many other undercover roles. Both investigators were also able to speak multiple languages, and this skill was also helpful when they were working undercover. In late 1925, Izzy and Moe were laid off in a reorganization of the bureau of enforcement. A report in &quot;Time&quot; magazine suggested they had attracted more publicity than wanted by the new political appointee heading the bureau, although the press and public loved the team.

Other famous lawmen who, at some point, carried a Prohi badge include James L. &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; Asher, Chicagoan Pat Roche, and Hannah Brigham.

==Corruption and public opinion==
On September 9, 1927, Assistant Treasury Secretary Seymour Lowman issued the following statement to the world&#x27;s press:

&quot;There are many incompetent, crooked men in the prohibition service. Bribery is rampant, and there are many wolves in sheep&#x27;s clothing. We are after them. Some days my arm gets tired signing orders of dismissal. I want to say, however, that there are a lot of splendid, fearless men in the service, and, fortunately they greatly outnumber the crooks.&quot;

=== Public opinion ===
The major obstacle faced by the Bureau was that the Volstead Act and the Prohibition of alcohol was widely unpopular, controversial, and divisive in American society. In 1929, the number of speakeasies and bars was double the number from before prohibition began. 

=== The mob infiltrates the bureau ===
Despite their mandate to stop consumption of alcohol, many prohibition agents reportedly accepted bribes in exchange for ignoring illegal trade in liquor, which has been ascribed, in part, to their relatively low wages. It was rumored that many agents imbibed the alcohol which they were responsible for confiscating. The public perception of Bureau agents was not favorable. Some prohibition agents became notorious for killing innocent civilians and harassing minor bootleggers, while ignoring gangsters and their rich customers.

=== The Ku Klux Klan and Prohibition enforcement ===
Temperance was often used as a smokescreen for many variations of bigotry to include xenophobia, white supremacism, nativism, anti-catholicism, eugenicism, and Manifest destiny. Their perception maintained an observation of the correlation that the target of their bigotry was an alcoholic; that many of the Catholic, Italian, Eastern European, and Irish immigrants to the United States were associated with public drunkenness.

Many of the members of the Anti-Saloon League joined the new Ku Klux Klan with the influx of immigrants to America at the turn of the century, which took a vigilante militia role in prohibition enforcement; they would extrajudicially target those suspected of violating the Volstead Act.

=== Black speakeasies and Prohibition enforcement ===
Certain speakeasies and hooch joints of the prohibition era were owned by black Americans searching for economic stability less than fifty years after the passage of the 15th Amendment, and have been called the birthplace of the jazz age. By the fact of their existence, these speakeasies were defying the law, and formed intimate business relationships with the bootleggers and gangsters that traded in illicit alcohol.

However, many of the leaders of the prohibition movement were also the most prominent voices in black American equality and civil rights. The list of prominent black &#x27;drys&#x27; (prohibitionists) includes Frederick Douglass, Martin Delany, Sojourner Truth, F.E.W. Harper, Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Booker T. Washington.

This dichotomy created a complex relationship between black Americans and their interpretation of freedom. No matter the relationship between black Americans and prohibition, this complicated the Bureau&#x27;s ability to enforce the Volstead Act.

==In popular culture==
* Eliot Ness&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, went on to become a bestseller and was later adapted into two television series (in 1959 and 1993) and a feature film.
* &quot;Izzy and Moe&quot;, a TV-movie starring Jackie Gleason and Art Carney, was loosely based on the real life Isador Einstein and Moe Smith.
* The Bureau of Prohibition is featured prominently in the HBO period crime series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, particularly through the character of Agent Nelson Van Alden.
* Ken Burns and Lynn Novick&#x27;s documentary &quot;Prohibition - Unintended Consequences&quot; on PBS covers the exploits of the Prohibition Bureau as part of The Prohibition Film Project.

<text>Franziska van Almsick (; born 5 April 1978) is a retired German swimmer, former world record holder in 200 metres freestyle. She was multiple World and European champion, in both Long and Short Course Championships.

==Career==

Her career began at the SC Dynamo Berlin in East Germany. Franziska van Almsick won 2 gold medals at the World Championships, 18 gold medals at the European championships and 4 gold medals at the European championships (SC).

At the World Championships in 1994, her teammate Dagmar Hase qualified for the 200 metre freestyle final as the eight best swimmer, leaving Franziska only with the ninth best qualification time. Therefore, Hase abandoned her start place and offered it to van Almsick, who then won the gold medal in the final bettering the world record.

Franziska won her first Olympic medals in 1992 at the Barcelona Olympic Games aged only 14. She won a Silver and Bronze respectively in 200 m freestyle and 100 m freestyle. In other team events, she won a Silver and Bronze respectively in 4x100 m medley relay and 4x100 m freestyle relay for the German swimming team.

She has the distinction of having the most career Olympic medals, ten, without ever winning a gold medal. She ended her career at the Athens Olympic Games in 2004.

In 1993, she was named by &quot;Swimming World magazine&quot; as the Female World Swimmer of the Year.

In 1995, she was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as &quot;the swimmer who united a nation&quot;, due to her status as &quot;the first big star of German reunification&quot;.

==Personal life==
She has two sons, born in 2006 and 2013. Her family resides in Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

In 1993, evidence revealed that her mother Jutta, a sports coach, had been a Stasi informer, though Jutta disputed this.

<text>Sallins () is a town in County Kildare, Ireland, situated 3.5 km north of the town centre of Naas, from which it is separated by the M7 motorway. Sallins is the anglicised name of &quot;Na Solláin&quot; which means &quot;the willows&quot;.

In the Central Statistics Office census of 2022, Sallins had a population of 6,269 people, more than double the 2,922 inhabitants recorded in the 2002 census. It is the tenth largest settlement in Kildare and the 80th largest in Ireland. 
Sallins grew as a result of its position on both the Grand Canal and the Dublin to Cork railway line. Historically, the major employers in the town were Odlums Flour Mills and a meat factory, although both have now closed.

Theobald Wolfe Tone is buried near Sallins in Bodenstown graveyard. Each summer, Irish republicans of various political and paramilitary groupings congregate at Sallins to hold commemorations at Tone&#x27;s grave.

== History ==
Sallins developed as a village with the opening of the Grand Canal to traffic in 1779 and a passenger service in 1780.

In the last decades of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century, Sallins was a popular spot for visitors to the grave of Wolfe Tone to congregate before marching to the gravesite. Many visitors would take the train from Dublin to Sallins and walk the 2.5 km to Tone&#x27;s grave in Bodenstown.

On 31 March 1976, a Cork to Dublin mail train was robbed and approximately £200,000 was stolen at a small farm crossing on the main train line near Sallins.

In the 1990s and 2000s Sallins became a commuter town of Dublin. The population grew significantly and increased sevenfold between 1996 and 2022.

==Transport==
The village&#x27;s railway station serves both Sallins itself and neighbouring Naas, as reflected in its official name of &quot;Sallins and Naas&quot;. Originally named just &quot;Sallins&quot;, it opened on 4 August 1846 and was the junction for the Tullow branch, which included the original &quot;Naas&quot; station. It closed in 1963, and was renamed &quot;Sallins &amp; Naas&quot; upon re-opening in 1994, as part of the Kildare &quot;Arrow&quot; commuter rail project.
A feeder bus operates between the station and the centre of Naas (Poplar Square &amp; Post Office). The station was the location of the Sallins Train robbery, Ireland&#x27;s largest train robbery, which occurred on 31 March 1976. Several hundred thousand pounds were stolen from a CIÉ train. Several people were tried for the robbery and jailed and the case eventually was adjudged a significant miscarriage of justice.

==Sport and amenities==
Sallins GAA has its grounds in the centre of the village which include a championship sized pitch, a clubhouse, and dressing rooms. The GAA club has been in existence since 1885.

The village is also home to the soccer club Sallins Celtic, and the Sallins Dramatic Society.
The canal near the village is used for fishing and boating. The Leinster Aqueduct is situated nearby, mid-way along the canal between Sallins and Caragh. This is the point where the Grand Canal crosses the River Liffey. In 2015, a passenger boat service began operating offering cruise excursions to Leinster Aqueduct and Digby Lock.

Each year since 2004 during August, the Sallins Community Festival is held which includes some local activities, including a beauty contest called &#x27;Queen of the Waterways&#x27;.

Sallins has one national (primary) school. As of 2020, Sallins National School (also known as St Laurences National School), had over 680 pupils enrolled.

<text>The Theban Mapping Project is an archaeological expedition devoted to Ancient Egypt. It was established in 1978 by the Egyptologist Dr. Kent R. Weeks at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1985, it was moved to the American University in Cairo. The Project&#x27;s original goal was to create an archaeological map of the Valley of the Kings, and that was published as the &quot;Atlas of the Valley of the Kings&quot; in 2000. Since 2001, the Project has also developed a management plan for the Valley of the Kings, which is funded by the World Monuments Fund.

The website had not been online for several years, due to lack of funding. However, with new funds having been made available by the American Research Center in Egypt, it went online again in January 2021, with new features and data.

<doc id="1085995" wikidata="Q1016909" url="?curid=1085995" title="Burrell Collection">
<text>The Burrell Collection is a museum in Glasgow, Scotland, managed by Glasgow Museums. It houses the art collection of Sir William Burrell and Constance, Lady Burrell. The museum opened in 1983 and reopened on 29 March 2022 following a major refurbishment. It was announced as the winner of the Art Fund Museum of the Year in July 2023. It is the only non-national museum to be the outright winner twice.

==History==

The eclectic collection was acquired over many years by Sir William Burrell, a wealthy Glasgow shipping magnate and art collector, and his wife Constance, Lady Burrell, who then gave it to the city of Glasgow Corporation in 1944. Throughout his collecting career, Burrell lent many of the works in his collection to special exhibitions and for display in museums. Sometime , he decided that he was going to donate his entire collection to the public.

Burrell then began the process of finding a home for the remaining 6,000 items. He initially wanted it to go to London, which he saw as the centre of the art world. He approached the Westminster government with the idea that he would leave his collection to the nation as a separate government institution, like the Wallace Collection. Although the government took the offer seriously, it had more pressing wartime priorities. Burrell then approached London County Council with a similar offer. Negotiations got to an advanced stage, but in the end the cost of maintaining the collection proved too much and the offer was declined.

Burrell then turned to Glasgow. He had already gifted 48 paintings and 30 prints to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in 1925, and much of his collection was already on semi-permanent display there, particularly the Chinese works. The museum had recently appointed Dr T. J. Honeyman as director, a man whom Burrell admired and trusted. His influence was instrumental in Burrell&#x27;s final decision to offer his collection to the city of Glasgow.

==Finding a home for the collection==
A memorandum of agreement between William and Constance and the Corporation of Glasgow was signed in April 1944. Burrell had clear intentions regarding the collection&#x27;s location, contents and display, and the agreement stated that the collection was to be housed by Glasgow Corporation &quot;in a suitable distinct and separated building&quot; that was to be &quot;within of Killearn, Stirlingshire, and not less than from Glasgow Royal exchange.&quot;

Burrell donated £450,000 for the construction of a museum for his collection, but finding a suitable site for it was not easy. The city had immediately started making investigations, and by the late 1940s, at least eight different sites were considered. Mugdock Castle Estate, near Milngavie, was seriously considered, even though it was much closer to Glasgow than the stipulated . In 1951, the Dougalston estate, also near Milngavie, was gifted to Glasgow by the widow of a Glasgow shipbuilder on the condition that the Burrell Collection be constructed on the site. Preparations got to an advanced stage, but in 1955, the National Coal Board announced plans to sink a coal mine nearby. All plans for the Burrell Collection were abandoned and the collection remained in storage for many years.

The ideal solution finally arrived with the offer of Pollok House and its estate to the city of Glasgow. This was the ancestral home of the Stirling-Maxwells on the south side of Glasgow. It was only from the city centre, but its parkland made it an ideal rural setting that was within the spirit of Burrell&#x27;s ambitions for his museum. After long and protracted negotiations, the government stepped in with financial support of £250,000 for the museum. In 1967, the Pollok estate was transferred to the city, and preparations to build the Burrell Collection finally got underway.

==Building==
In 1970, an architectural competition was launched to identify a suitable architect for the museum. The competition brief made it clear that whilst the competitors were to comply with Burrell&#x27;s exacting conditions, they were at liberty to design &quot;a fine modern building&quot; which would make the most out of both the collection and the site. The closing date for the competition for the museum building in 1971 was delayed by a postal strike, allowing time for the eventual winning architect Barry Gasson to complete his entry, designed in collaboration with John Meunier and Brit Andresen, all tutors at Cambridge University&#x27;s School of Architecture.

As the project progressed, the costs increased, and this jeopardized the museum. Glasgow Corporation approached the government for additional support. The Secretary of State for Scotland promised to meet 50 per cent of the estimated £9.6 million cost in recognition that the Burrell Collection was not just important for Glasgow, but was a national treasure that would benefit the country as a whole.

Construction work commenced on 3 May 1978 and continued over the next five years. The building was influenced by Scandinavian design. The architects used the orientation of the building to bring in as much natural light as possible, while still protecting the vulnerable parts of the collection. The integration of the building, its rural setting, and the collection was central to the architects&#x27; thinking, and the way in which the objects were built into the structure ensured that the museum became a part of the collection rather than simply being a space in which Burrell&#x27;s objects were housed.

The building is L-shaped in plan and is tailored to house and display the collection, with larger pieces such as Romanesque doorways built into the structure, at the same time giving views out into the park over formal grassed areas to the south and into adjacent woodland to the north.

The entrance, through a 16th-century stone archway built into a modern red sandstone gable, leads to a shop and other facilities, then on to a central courtyard under a glazed roof, adjacent to the reconstructions of three rooms from the Burrells&#x27; home, Hutton Castle near Berwick-on-Tweed: the wood-panelled drawing room, hall, and dining room complete with their furnishings. Galleries on two levels house various smaller artefacts, over a basement storage level, and at the lower level a restaurant gives views over the lawn to the south.

The museum was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 21 October 1983. More than a million visitors passed through its doors in the first year, and the Burrell Collection quickly established itself as one of Glasgow&#x27;s most-loved buildings. It was named as Scotland&#x27;s second greatest post-war building (after Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia&#x27;s St Peter&#x27;s Seminary, now derelict) in a poll of architects by &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine in 2005.

===Awards for the original building===
The Burrell Collection received the following awards after it first opened in 1983:

* British Tourism Authority Come to Britain Trophy, 1984

* Civic Trust Award, 1985
* Eternit Architecture Prize, 1985
* Designer Award, Interior Design Category, 1986
* International Academy of Architecture Gold Award, 1987

The building was awarded A-listed status by Historic Scotland in February 2013 in recognition of its position as one of the country&#x27;s finest examples of 1970s architectural design.

===2016–2022 refurbishment===
In 2016, the museum was closed for refurbishments. The £68.25 million project aimed to repair the building, make it more sustainable, and increase gallery space. On 29 March 2022, the museum reopened to the public, with King Charles III visiting on 13 October 2022 to officially re-open the venue.

==Collection==
Containing over 9,000 objects, the Burrell contains an important collection of medieval art including stained glass and tapestries, oak furniture, medieval weapons and armour, Islamic art, artefacts from ancient Egypt and China, Impressionist works by Degas and Cézanne, modern sculpture and a host of other artefacts from around the world, all collected by Burrell. Paintings from five centuries and artworks spanning six millennia are found in the collection.

===Chinese art===
Burrell started collecting Chinese antiques . He acquired items from all periods of Chinese history; including Neolithic burial urns, carved jades, porcelain from the Tang dynasty, bronze ritual vessels, earthenware figures, and antique furniture. The collection now includes one of the most significant holdings of Chinese art in the UK.

===Islamic art===
Islamic antiques donated by Burrell to the museum include: Hispano-Moresque lustreware, ceramics and carpets from Iran and the Mughal Empire, as well as embroideries and textiles from Turkey and Uzbekistan. One highlight is The Wagner Garden Carpet from 17th century Iran as one of the most remarkable garden carpets to have survived to the present.

===Medieval art===
====Gothic art====
The museum has a collection of religious art from the medieval period. This includes wood and stone sculptures, wooden church furnishings and architectural fragments. One of these items is the Temple Pyx. 

====Tapestries====
The collection has over 200 tapestries and carpets.

====Stained glass====
The museum is home to more than 700 stained glass panels from across Europe in the collection, including many examples of Gothic, Renaissance, and Romanesque styles. Much of the glass has heraldic motifs.

In 2013, a project was commenced to conserve and research the museum&#x27;s collection of stained glass from the Carmelite church at Boppard-am-Rhein, Germany. The 34 panels that make up the Burrell collection of Boppard windows have a combined surface area of 14 square metres.

===French art===
The collection includes an array of French art from Realist painting to Impressionism, including works by Bonvin, Boudin, Corot, Courbet, Daubigny, Daumier, Degas, Fantin-Latour, Manet and Millet.

Burrell had a particular appreciation for Degas and with more than 20 works by the artist, the museum now holds one of the greatest collections of Degas&#x27;s works in the world.

==Claims for Nazi-looted art==
During the 1930s and 1940s, many artworks came onto the market as a result of forced auction sales of works belonging to Jewish collectors by the Nazis. Burrell acquired works from a number of dealers during this time. Although he was not aware of it at the time, subsequent research shows that a number of works originated from forced sales. Following the establishment of the UK government&#x27;s Spoliation Advisory Panel in 2000, Glasgow Museums listed works from the Burrell Collection on the official spoliation website whose provenance had gaps between 1933 and 1945. This has enabled two cases to be successfully resolved by the Spoliation Advisory Panel:

* A still life by Chardin from the sale of the stock of A. S. Drey, a Jewish-owned gallery in Munich. The panel agreed in 2004 that the painting had been subject to a forced sale and that it should be restituted to its rightful owners. The heirs accepted an &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment of £10,000 from Glasgow City Council and the painting remains in the collection.
* A Swiss early 16th-century tapestry, &quot;The Visitation&quot;, from the collection of Emma Ranette Budge, a Jewish art collector from Hamburg, The panel concluded in 2014 that Burrell&#x27;s acquisition was the result of a forced sale. Glasgow City Council agreed to make an &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment to Budge&#x27;s Estate that reflected the current market value of the tapestry. In consideration of this payment, Budge&#x27;s Estate released any claim over the tapestry and it remains in the collection.

==Transport links==
The nearest railway station to the Burrell Collection is Pollokshaws West (approximately a 10-minute walk), with trains to Glasgow Central normally operating four times per hour (three times an hour on Sundays).

Pollok House, administered by the National Trust for Scotland, is also situated in Pollok Country Park.

A free shuttle bus is also available, linking key points in the park from the Burrell Collection to Pollok House. One of the stops is located inside the park, nearby Pollokshaws Road, entrance and continues in a loop throughout the park.

<text>The Wealden iron industry was located in the Weald of south-eastern England. It was formerly an important industry, producing a large proportion of the bar iron made in England in the 16th century and most British cannon until about 1770. Ironmaking in the Weald used ironstone from various clay beds, and was fuelled by charcoal made from trees in the heavily wooded landscape. The industry in the Weald declined when ironmaking began to be fuelled by coke made from coal, which does not occur accessibly in the area.

==Resources==

Iron ore in the form of siderite, commonly known as iron stone or historically as mine, occurs in patches or bands in the Cretaceous clays of the Weald. Differing qualities of ore were extracted and mixed by experienced smelters to give the best results. Sites of opencast quarries survive from the pre-Roman and Roman eras, but medieval ore extraction was mainly done by digging a series of minepits about five metres in diameter and up to twelve metres deep with material being winched up in baskets suspended from a wooden tripod. This was less destructive of the land as spoil from one pit was used to backfill the previous pit allowing continued land use.

The fuel for smelting was charcoal, which needed to be produced as close as possible to the smelting sites because it would crumble to dust if transported far by cart over rough tracks. Wood was also needed for pre-roasting the ore on open fires, a process which broke down the lumps or nodules and converted the carbonate into oxide. Large areas of woodland were available in the Weald and coppicing woodlands could provide a sustainable source of wood. Sustainable charcoal production for a post-medieval blast furnace required the timber production from a radius of a furnace in a landscape that was a quarter to a third wooded. Forging and finishing of the iron from bloomeries and blast furnaces also required large quantities of charcoal and was usually carried out at a separate site.
Water power became important with the introduction of blast furnaces and finery forges in the late medieval period. Blast furnaces needed to operate continuously for as long as possible and a series of ponds were often created in a valley to give a sustainable flow for the waterwheel. A campaign, as the production run was known, usually ran from October through to late spring when streams began to dry up, although Lamberhurst Furnace driven by the River Teise ran continuously for more than three years in the 1740s. Finery forges with three or four waterwheels to drive bellows and hammers needed more water than a furnace at times, although continuity was not as important. They tended to be sited downstream from a furnace if they were in the same valley. Ponds were created by building a dam known as a pond bay, which often served as a road, across one of the many valleys in the undulating Wealden landscape. In 1754 one furnace was so drought-stricken that its manager considered hiring workmen to turn the wheel as a treadmill. This need for continuous water power was an incentive in the development of the water-returning engine, a waterwheel driven by water raised by a steam engine pump.

==Prehistoric ironmaking==
So far only about two dozen sites have been identified where iron was made before the Roman invasion, mostly scattered across East Sussex and the Vale of Kent. A large site at Broadfield, Crawley is the westernmost place where smelting has been ascertained, although there is a possible site associated with an Iron Age enclosure at Piper&#x27;s Copse near Northchapel in the western Weald. Continuity of pottery styles from the Iron Age into the early Roman period makes precise dating of many sites to before or after the Roman conquest difficult. Carbon dating has identified a site at Cullinghurst Wood, Hartfield to between 350 and 750 BC.

During his invasions of Britain in 55 and 54 BC Julius Caesar noted iron production near the coast, possibly at known sites at Sedlescombe and Crowhurst Park near Hastings.

==Roman ironmaking==

The Romans made full use of the brown- and ochre-coloured stone in the Weald, and many of their roads there are the means of transport for the ore, and were extensively metalled with slag from iron smelting. The sites of about 113 bloomeries have been identified as Roman, mainly in East Sussex. The Weald was in this period one of the most important iron-producing regions in Roman Britain. Excavations at a few sites have produced tiles of the &quot;Classis Britannica&quot;, suggesting that they were actually run by, or were supplying iron to this Roman fleet. Total iron production has been estimated at 750 tons per year, but under 200 tons per year after 250 AD.

==Medieval==
The invasion and settlement of the Weald by Saxons seems to have brought a complete end to the Romano-British iron industry. No evidence of iron smelting has been found after the end of Roman rule until the ninth century when a primitive bloomery was built at Millbrook on Ashdown Forest, with a small hearth for reheating the blooms nearby. The date of this site has been established by radiocarbon and archaeomagnetic methods. The technology used there was similar to a slightly earlier furnace excavated in the eastern Netherlands, indicating that knowledge of Romano-British methods had been completely lost and replaced by the Saxons&#x27; own method. Evidence of forging of iron blooms in settlements close to the South Downs does indicate that smelting may have been going on at other undiscovered sites. It was usual for settlements concentrated along the Downs to have outlying parcels of land in the Weald for summer grazing. It is likely that smelting was carried out during the summer and the iron blooms taken back to the main settlement to work on in the winter.

In all some 30 unpowered medieval bloomery sites are known in the Weald, but most of these remain undated. Accounts survive of the operation of just one, at Tudeley near Tonbridge in the mid-14th century.

==Powered bloomeries==
From about the 14th century, water-power began to be applied to bloomeries, but fewer than ten such sites are suspected.

==The introduction of the blast furnace==
A new ironmaking process was devised in the Namur region of what is now Belgium in the 15th century. This spread to the &quot;pays de Bray&quot; on the eastern boundary of Normandy and then to the Weald. The new smelting process involved a blast furnace and finery forge. It was introduced in about 1490 at Queenstock in Buxted parish. The number of ironworks increased greatly from about 1540.

==The mature industry==

Nearly 180 sites in all were used for this process, having a furnace, a forge or both between the 15th century and 18th century. Waterpower was the means of operating the bellows in the blast furnaces and for operating bellows and helve hammers in finery forges. Scattered through the Weald are ponds still to be found called ’Furnace Pond’ or ’Hammer Pond’. The iron was used for making household utensils, nails and hinges; and for casting cannon. The first blast furnace was recorded at Buxted in 1490.

The industry was at its peak towards the end of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign. Most works were small, but at Brenchley one ironmaster employed 200 men. Most of them would have been engaged in mining ore and cutting wood (for charcoal), as the actual ironworks only required a small workforce. The wars fought during the reign of Henry VIII increased the need for armaments, and the Weald became the centre of an armaments industry. Cast-iron cannon were made in the Weald from 1543 when Buxted&#x27;s Ralf Hogge cast the first iron cannon for his unlikely employer: a Sussex vicar who was gunstonemaker to the king.
In the 16th century and the early 17th century, the Weald was a major source of iron for manufacture in London, peaking at over 9000 tons per year in the 1590s. However, after 1650, Wealden production became increasingly focused on the production of cannon; and bar iron was only produced for local consumption. This decline may have begun as early as the 1610s, when Midland ironware began to be sold in London. Certainly after Swedish iron began to be imported in large quantities after the Restoration, Wealden bar iron seems to have been unable to compete in the London market.

Cannon production was a major activity in the Weald until the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, but a cut in the price paid by the Board of Ordnance drove several Wealden ironmasters into bankruptcy. They were unable to match the much lower price that was acceptable to the Scottish Carron Company, whose fuel was coke. A few ironworks continued operating on a very small scale. With no local source of mineral coal, the Wealden iron industry was unable to compete with the new coke-fired ironworks of the Industrial Revolution. The last to close was the forge at Ashburnham. Little survives of the furnace and forge buildings, although there are still scores of the industry&#x27;s hammer and furnace ponds scattered throughout the Weald.

Steel production was never widespread in the Weald, with most high quality steel being imported from Spain, the Middle East, or Germany. A steel forge was built upstream from Newbridge Furnace on Ashdown Forest around 1505 but had ceased production by 1539. The Sydney family, with mills at Robertsbridge forge and at Sandhurst in Kent, produced steel using skilled German workers, but faced strong competition from German suppliers. In the 17th century a steel forge existed at Warbleton in Sussex.

==St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral==
The Lamberhurst Foundry is believed to have been the maker in 1710–14 of some of the earliest cast-iron railings produced in England, which they made for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, despite the objections of Christopher Wren, who did not want a fence around the Cathedral at all, and said that if there had to be one it should be of wrought rather than cast iron. The railings surrounded the cathedral, including seven gates. It weighed two hundred tons and cost six pence a pound. The total cost was £11,202. No further railings are known to have been cast in the Weald. Other early uses of cast iron railings were at Cambridge Senate House and at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.

<text>The Nevis River is in Otago, New Zealand. It flows north for through rough country before meeting the Kawarau River, of which it is a tributary. A prominent rock outcrop close to this junction is known as the Nevis Bluff.

The river was one of the sites of the Otago gold rush of the 1860s. Today, the region around the river is known for tourism and wine production. New Zealand&#x27;s highest bungy jumping operation, the Nevis Highwire is above the river.

A Water Conservation Order protects the river for its wild and scenic character and for recreational use, especially fishing and kayaking. The Water Conservation Order made provision for damming the river for hydro-electric development. Fish and Game New Zealand applied to have this provision revoked and in 2013, after a public process with consideration by a special tribunal and the Environment Court, the Environment Minister decided to prevent damming of the river.

Nokomai patterned mire, in the upper catchment, is part of a relatively unmodified wetland on several square kilometres of the southern Garvie Mountains. It is possibly the largest such area in Australasia and is dominated by grasses, sedges and mosses, with shallow pools, small islands and clumps of low vegetation. The mire drains north via Roaring Lion Creek to the Nevis and south via Dome Burn to the Waikaia River. A small part of the mire is in the Nokomai catchment.

<text>The Matukituki River is a short braided river in the Southern Alps of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Both its West Branch and East Branch originate from the Main Divide mountain ranges near Mount Aspiring / Tititea. Their largely glacier-fed waters each flow for approximately before joining near Camerons Flat. After this confluence, the Matukituki River leaves the boundaries of Mount Aspiring National Park and continues for another to exit into Lake Wānaka at the lake&#x27;s southwestern edge.

Six glaciers feed tributary streams to the Matukituki River, the largest being the Upper Volta Glacier, Rob Roy Glacier, Maud Francis Glacier, and the Avalanche Glacier.

From Camerons Flat onwards, the river is increasingly braided until it passes through a narrow gorge and under the West Wanaka bridge just before Lake Wānaka.

== History ==
Most of the Southern Alps started over 220 million years ago as sediment and rock on top of volcanic rocks on the seafloor. Intense heat and pressure consolidated the rock, and then uplifted it to form the Main Divide. The present landscape was shaped by glacial processes during the ice ages, when huge glaciers filled and scoured out the valleys.

The area around Mount Aspiring, called Tititea by the Māori, has a long history of Māori tribes coming from as far as Coastal Otago and the Foveaux Strait to the inland lakes to collect kākāpō, kererū, kākā and tūī from the forest. Moa would have also have lived along the forest edges for the first 200 years of Māori settlement.

The historic Māori &quot;iwi&quot; (tribes) of Kāti Māmoe and Ngāi Tahu both had named settlements around the shores of Lakes Wānaka and Hāwea, including Nehenehe on the northern banks of the mouth of the Matukituki River, which they called &quot;Mātakitaki&quot;. Ovens for cooking &quot;tī kōuka&quot; (cabbage tree) roots have been found at several sites on the lake shore. Ngāi Tahu recorded Mātakitaki as a (food-gathering place) for (eels), (cabbage tree root), and (bracken fernroot).

The first European to see Mount Aspiring was government surveyor John Turnbull Thompson in 1857. The West Matukituki Valley was explored by James Hector in 1862. Sheep and cattle farming began progressing up the valley in the 1870s.

==Fauna and flora==
Today, beech is the dominant forest in the Matukituki Valley. Red beech prefers warmer valley sites, and is common just below Aspiring Hut. Silver beech grows increasingly towards the wetter, western end of the valley, while mountain beech dominates the drier, eastern end. The understory of the typically open forests supports a variety of ferns and mosses. Above the tree line, at about , stunted, sub-alpine shrub land gives way to alpine tussock grasslands and fell fields.

Insect-eating birds such as pīwakawaka, tomtit and rifleman thrive in the beech forest, whereas the seed-eating kākāriki specifically prefers areas of red beech. Paradise shelduck thrive on the river flats, and in summer, spur-winged plover and oystercatchers are a common sight on farmland and along the drive from Wānaka. The valley is also home to the kea, whio, South Island robin, rock wren, the South Island long tailed bat, and several species of lizards.

==Tourism==
The Matukituki River valley is home to a ski resort (Treble Cone), a jetboat operator (River Journeys) and numerous tramping (walking) trails providing access to landmarks such as the Rob Roy Glacier, the Dart Saddle, and the Cascade Saddle. The unsealed Wanaka - Mount Aspiring Road follows the river&#x27;s true right for most of its course, past the confluence of the East Branch and West Branch, and part-way along the West Branch to a Department of Conservation NZ car park at the Raspberry Creek shelter.

The most popular walk in the area is the Rob Roy Glacier walk, which leads up a side valley to a view point beneath Rob Roy Glacier. The walking track crosses the Matukituki River West Branch over a swing bridge.

<text>Matthew Phipps Shiell (21 July 1865 – 17 February 1947), known as M. P. Shiel, was a British writer, remembered mainly for supernatural horror and scientific romances. His work was published as serials, novels, and as short stories. &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; (1901, revised 1929) remains his most often reprinted novel.

==Biography==

===Caribbean background===
Matthew Phipps Shiell was born on the island of Montserrat in the West Indies. His mother was Priscilla Ann Blake; his father was Matthew Dowdy Shiell, most probably the illegitimate child of an Irish Customs officer and a female slave. Shiell was educated at Harrison College, Barbados.

===Early years in the UK===
Shiell moved to England in 1885, eventually adopting Shiel as his pen name. After working as a teacher and translator, a series of his short stories began to be published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; and other periodicals. His early literary reputation was based on two collections of short stories influenced by Poe published in the Keynote series by John Lane – &quot;Prince Zaleski&quot; (1895) and &quot;Shapes in the Fire&quot; (1896) – considered by some critics to be the most flamboyant works of the English decadent movement. His first novel was &quot;The Rajah&#x27;s Sapphire&quot; (1896), based on a plot by William Thomas Stead, who probably hired Shiel to write the novel.

===Serial publication===
Shiel&#x27;s popular reputation was made by another work for hire. This began as a serial contracted by Peter Keary (1865–1915), of C. Arthur Pearson Ltd, to capitalise on public interest in a crisis in China (which became known as the Scramble for Concessions).

&quot;The Empress of the Earth&quot; ran weekly in &quot;Short Stories&quot; from 5 February – 18 June 1898. The early chapters incorporated actual headline events as the crisis unfolded, and proved a success with the reading public. Pearson responded by ordering Shiel to double the length of the serial to 150,000 words, but Shiel cut it back by a third for the book version, which was rushed out that July as &quot;The Yellow Danger&quot;.

Some contemporary critics described this novel as a fictionalisation of Charles Henry Pearson&#x27;s &quot;National Life and Character: A Forecast&quot; (1893). Shiel&#x27;s Asian villain, Dr. Yen How, has been cited as a possible basis for Sax Rohmer&#x27;s much better-known Dr. Fu Manchu. Dr. Yen How was probably based on the Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925), who had first gained fame in England in 1896 when he was kidnapped and imprisoned at the Chinese embassy in London until public outrage pressured the British government to demand his release. Similar kidnapping incidents occurred in several of Shiel&#x27;s subsequent novels. &quot;The Yellow Danger&quot; was Shiel&#x27;s most successful book during his lifetime. Shiel himself considered the novel hackwork, and seemed embarrassed by its success. It was a likely influence on H.G. Wells in &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (1908), Jack London in &quot;The Unparalleled Invasion&quot; (1910), and others.

His next novel was another serial contracted by Pearson to tie into the Spanish–American War. &quot;Contraband of War&quot; ran in &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Weekly&quot; 7 May – 9 July 1898, again incorporating headline events into the serial as the war progressed. It was published as a book the following year.

===Genre innovator===

Around 1899–1900, Shiel conceived a loosely linked trilogy of novels which were described by David G. Hartwell in his introduction to the Gregg Press edition of &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; as possibly the first future history series in science fiction. Each was linked by similar introductory frame purporting to show that the novels were visions of progressively more distant (or alternative?) futures glimpsed by a clairvoyant in a trance. Notebook I of the series had been plotted at least by 1898, but would not see print until published as &quot;The Last Miracle&quot; (1906). Notebook II became &quot;The Lord of the Sea&quot; (1901), which was recognised by contemporary readers as a critique of private ownership of land based on the theories of Henry George.

Shiel&#x27;s lasting literary reputation is largely based on Notebook III of the series which was serialised in &quot;The Royal Magazine&quot; in abridged form before book publication that autumn as &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; (1901). &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; is an important text of early British science fiction, a dystopian, post-apocalytic novel that tells the tale of Adam Jeffson, who, returning alone from an expedition to the North Pole, discovers that a worldwide catastrophe has left him as the last man alive. Demonstrative of the speculative, philosophical impulse that pervades Shiel&#x27;s work, &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; engages with Victorian developments in the sciences of geology and biology, tending to home in on their dark sides of geological cataclysm and racial decline in keeping with what has been termed the &quot;fin-de-siècle&quot; &#x27;apocalyptic imaginary&#x27;, while ultimately putting forward a positive if unorthodox view of catastrophe.

Shiel had married a young Parisian-Spaniard, Carolina Garcia Gomez in 1898; she was the model for a character in &quot;Cold Steel&quot; (1900) and several short stories. (The Welsh author and mystic Arthur Machen and decadent poet Theodore Wratislaw were among the wedding guests.) They separated around 1903 and his daughter was taken to Spain after Lina&#x27;s death around 1904. Shiel blamed the failure of the marriage on the interference of his mother-in-law, but money was at the heart of their problems. Shiel was caught between his desire to write high art and his need to produce more commercial fare. When his better efforts did not sell well, he was forced to seek more journalistic work, and began to collaborate with Louis Tracy on a series of romantic mystery novels, some published under Tracy&#x27;s name, others under the pseudonyms Gordon Holmes and Robert Fraser. The last of their known collaborations appeared in 1911.

===Edwardian times===
In 1902, Shiel turned away from the more dramatic future war and science fiction themes which had dominated his early serial novels and began a series which have been described as his middle period romantic novels. The most interesting was the first, serialised as &quot;In Love&#x27;s Whirlpool&quot; in &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Saturday Journal&quot;, 14 May – 3 September 1902, and published in book form as &quot;The Weird o&#x27;It&quot; (1902). Shiel later described it as a &quot;true Bible or Holy Book&quot; for modern times, in which he had attempted to represent &quot;Christianity in a radical way.&quot; This novel was far from hackwork, and besides apparent autobiographical elements (including a minor character based on Ernest Dowson with whom Shiel is rumoured to have roomed briefly in the 1890s), contains some of his finest writing, but it was not reprinted in England, nor formally published in America.

Shiel returned to contemporary themes in &quot;The Yellow Wave&quot; (1905), an historical novel about the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. The novel was a recasting of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; into the ongoing war with leading families of the two nations standing in for the feuding Capulets and Montagues of Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Shiel modelled his hero on Yoshio Markino (1874–1956), the Japanese artist and author who lived in London from 1897–1942. In February 1904, Shiel had offered to Peter Keary to go to the front as a war correspondent with letters of introduction from Markino. He may have met Markino through Arthur Ransome who dedicated &quot;Bohemia in London&quot; (1907) to Shiel and used him as the model for the chapter on &quot;The Novelist.&quot;

Faced with declining sales of his books, Shiel tried to recapture the success of &quot;The Yellow Danger&quot; when China and Sun Yat-sen returned to the headlines during the Chinese Revolution of 1911–1912. Though a better novel in most respects, &quot;The Dragon&quot; (1913), serialised earlier that year as &quot;To Arms!&quot; and revised in 1929 as &quot;The Yellow Peril&quot;, failed to catch the public&#x27;s interest. As the hero of the story had oddly predicted, Shiel turned away from novels for ten years.

=== 1914 conviction for child molestation===
It was once popularly believed that Shiel had spent time in prison for fraud; however, it was discovered in 2008 that in 1914 Shiel had actually been convicted under the Criminal Law Amendment Act (1885) for &quot;indecently assaulting and carnally knowing&quot; his 12-year-old &quot;de facto&quot; stepdaughter. Unrepentant, Shiel served sixteen months hard labour in prison, complaining to the Home Secretary about the law, though he assured his publisher Grant Richards in a letter that he had been treated well. Shiel&#x27;s discussion of his crime is disingenuous; he conceals from Richards the identity of his victim in addition to misleading him about her age, and instead refers to &quot;love-toyings&quot; with an older girl on the cusp of maturity. Nor does Shiel mention that he had known both the girl and her mother&#x27;s sisters long before his conviction, perhaps intimately, as contemporary letters from one of the sisters to Shiel suggest. Court records described Shiel as a &quot;clerk and metal worker&quot;; one of the witnesses was a metal worker and the records may have transposed some information. He appealed the conviction unsuccessfully.

The case was reported in &quot;The Vote&quot;, a weekly women&#x27;s suffrage newspaper, on 4 December 1914 in its &quot;Protected Sex&quot; section. The article states that Shiel (misspelled as Sheil) denied the whole story and that the &quot;case was remarkable for the philosophical discussions on sex&quot; by Shiel who conducted his own defence. Shiel was described as having a &quot;purient mind&quot; [sic] by the presiding Judge, Mr Justice Coleridge. The article was rediscovered in 2019, 11 years after MacLeod&#x27;s initial discovery.

It is too early to assess whether this new revelation about Shiel will have an impact upon his literary legacy. However, as Macleod argues in her essay, young heroines abound in Shiel&#x27;s novels, where they are romanticised, idealised and sexualised through the eyes of the male author. She cites the example of the two-thousand-year-old Rachel in &quot;This Above All&quot; (1933), who is portrayed as part &quot;child,&quot; part &quot;harlot,&quot; part &quot;saint&quot;, since she still inhabits the young girl&#x27;s body she possessed when raised from the dead and thus rendered immortal by the Biblical Christ. Lazarus (also a 2,000-year-old immortal for the same reason) is warned ruefully against her: “If Rachel and you co-habit without some marriage-rite, you may see yourself in prison here in Europe, since it cannot be believed that she is as old as fourteen.”

===Georgian times===
Over the next decade Shiel wrote five plays, dabbled in radical politics and translated at least one, though probably more, pamphlets for the Workers Socialist Federation. In 1919, he married his second wife, Esther Lydia Jewson (née Furley) (August 16, 1872 – February 16, 1942). Esther Lydia&#x27;s first husband was William Arthur Jewson (July 12, 1856 - April 26, 1914), a prominent musician who had been born in London and died of a heart attack. Shiel and Esther travelled in Italy in the early 1920s, probably living largely off her income, and separated around 1929, but did not divorce. The separation was precipitated by Shiel&#x27;s sexual interest in and possible abuse of Esther Lydia&#x27;s young female relatives. Shiel then lived at Harold&#x27;s Cross, close to Esther Lydia&#x27;s house, &#x27;The Kiln&#x27; at Wisborough Green, West Sussex.

He returned to writing around 1922 and between 1923 and 1937 published a further ten or so books, as well as thorough revisions of five of his earlier novels. Shiel spent most of his last decade working on a &quot;truer&quot; translation of the Gospel of Luke with extensive commentary. He finished it, but half of the final draft was lost after his death in Chichester.

In 1931, Shiel met a young poet and bibliophile, John Gawsworth, who befriended him and helped him obtain a Civil List pension. Gawsworth talked Shiel into allowing him to complete several old story fragments, sometimes roping literary friends like Oswell Blakeston into helping. The results were largely unsuccessful, but Gawsworth used them as filler in various anthologies with his name prominently listed as co-author.

===Redonda: the legend of the kingdom===
As King Felipe, Shiel was purportedly the king of Redonda, a small uninhabited rocky island in the West Indies, situated a short distance northwest of the island of Montserrat, where Shiel was born.

The Redonda legend was probably created out of his imagination by Shiel himself and was first mentioned publicly in a 1929 booklet advertising the reissue of four of his novels by Victor Gollancz Ltd. According to the story Shiel told, he was crowned King of Redonda on his 15th birthday in 1880. However, there is little evidence that Shiel took these claims seriously. His biographer, Harold Billings, speculates that the story may have been an intentional hoax foisted on the gullible press. At this late date, verifying or discrediting the story may be impossible.

On his death, John Gawsworth became both his literary executor and his appointed heir to the &quot;kingdom&quot;. Gawsworth took the legend of Redonda to heart. He never lost an opportunity to further elaborate the tale and spread the story to the press. Gawsworth supposedly kept the ashes of Shiel &quot;in a biscuit tin on the mantelpiece, putting a pinch in the stew for special guests.&quot;

==Legacy==
Excluding the collaborations with Tracy, Shiel published over 30 books, including 25 novels and various collections of short stories, essays and poems. Arkham House issued two posthumous collections, &quot;Xelucha and Others&quot; (1975) and &quot;Prince Zaleski and Cummings King Monk&quot; (1977). &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot; remains his best known and most reprinted novel. It has been variously described as both a neglected masterpiece and the best of all Last Man novels. It was credited as the loose inspiration for the film, &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; (1959), starring Harry Belafonte, Inger Stevens, and Mel Ferrer. Stephen King cited it as an influence on his novel &quot;The Stand&quot;.

Some of the short stories continue to be reprinted, but many of his other novels, including the middle period romantics, have been nearly forgotten. As of January 1, 2018, all of the works published during Shiel&#x27;s lifetime have entered the public domain in the United Kingdom and all other countries with a copyright term of Life of the Author plus 70 years.

<doc id="1086031" wikidata="Q2160826" url="?curid=1086031" title="Cranbrook, Kent">
<text>Cranbrook is a town in the civil parish of Cranbrook and Sissinghurst, in the Weald of Kent in South East England. It lies roughly half-way between Maidstone and Hastings, about southeast of central London.

The smaller settlements of Sissinghurst, Swattenden, Colliers Green and Hartley lie within the civil parish. The population of the parish was 6,717 in 2011.

== History ==

The place name Cranbrook derives from Old English &quot;cran bric&quot;, meaning Crane Marsh, marshy ground frequented by cranes (although more probably herons). Spelling of the place name has evolved over the centuries from &quot;Cranebroca&quot; (c. 1100); by 1226 it was recorded as &quot;Cranebroc&quot;, then Cranebrok. By 1610 the name had become Cranbrooke, which evolved into the current spelling.

There is evidence of early activity here in the Roman period at the former Little Farningham Farm where a substantial iron working site was investigated in the 1950s. In 2000 the site was the subject of a Kent Archaeological Society fieldwork project to establish the extent of the site and the line of the Roman road from Rochester to Bodiam, which was published in 2001. The site had earlier produced a number of clay tiles bearing the mark of the Roman Fleet, or Classis Brittanica who may have been overseeing the work.

Edward III brought over Flemish weavers to develop the Wealden cloth industry using wool from Romney Marsh; Cranbrook became the centre of this as it had local supplies of fuller&#x27;s earth and plenty of streams that could be dammed to drive the fulling mills. Iron-making was carried on at Bedgebury on the River Teise, an industry which dates back to Roman times. The tributaries of the River Beult around Cranbrook powered 17 watermills at one time. In 1290 the town received a charter from Archbishop Peckham, allowing it to hold a market in the High Street.

Baker&#x27;s Cross on the eastern edge of the town is linked to John Baker, Chancellor of the Exchequer under Queen Mary, a Catholic. Legend holds that he was riding on his way to Cranbrook in order to have two local Protestants executed, when he turned back after the news reached him that Queen Mary was dead. Different versions of the legend have it that he heard the parish church bells ringing, or that he was met by a messenger. The place where this happened was, in the words of biographer and historian Arthur Irwin Dasent, &quot;at a place where three roads meet, known to this day as Baker&#x27;s Cross&quot;.

Popular legend also has it that Baker was killed at Baker&#x27;s Cross; although in fact he died in his house in London.

The town developed around the &quot;King&#x27;s High Road&quot; (now named as High Street, Stone Street and Waterloo Road) until the Second World War. Following the war, additional housing was built adjacent to the historic centre – the Wheatfield Estate to the north and the Frythe Estate to the south. In the 1970s, a Conservation Area was designated in the town centre. Most of the buildings on High Street, Stone Street and The Hill are listed.

== Governance ==
In 1974 Cranbrook Rural District was merged into the Borough of Tunbridge Wells. In 2010 Francis Rook of the Liberal Democrats won one of the three council seats in the Benenden and Cranbrook ward from the Conservatives to become one of only 6 non-Conservative councillors out of 48 in the borough.

The name of the parish council was changed from Cranbrook Parish Council to Cranbrook and Sissinghurst Parish Council in 2009. The parish council is based in the Old Fire Station on Stone Street.

== Geography ==
Located on the Maidstone to Hastings road, it is five miles north of Hawkhurst. Baker&#x27;s Cross is on the eastern outskirts of the town.

Cranbrook is on the Hastings Beds, alternating sands and clays which are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding clays and so form the hills of the High Weald. The geology of the area has played a major role in the town&#x27;s development, deposits of iron ore and fuller&#x27;s earth were important in the iron industry and cloth industry respectively.

== Demography ==
At the 2011 census, Cranbrook had 6,717 residents. The Kent Structure Plan calls it the smallest town in Kent, although Fordwich has a town council and just 381 residents.

== Economy ==
Since the decline of the cloth trade, agriculture became the mainstay of the economy.

The first bank was opened in Cranbrook in 1803 by Samuel Waddington. It closed in 1805. In 1804, the Cranbrook Bank was opened. It changed its name to the Weald of Kent Bank in 1812 and then to Bishop &amp; Co&#x27;s Bank in 1813 before being declared bankrupt in October 1814.

The Tooth family of Great Swifts, near Cranbrook, established a brewery at Baker&#x27;s Cross. A large part of their trade was the export of beer to Australia. Subsequently, John Tooth emigrated to Australia in the early 1830s, traded for a time as a general merchant, and then in 1835, with his brother-in-law, John Newnham, opened a brewery in Sydney. He named the brewery Kent Brewery, which continued to 1985. Meanwhile, the brewery at Cranbrook had been sold to one William Barling Sharpe, whose daughter had married the local estate agent, William Winch. The brewery Sharpe &amp; Winch was established in Baker&#x27;s Cross at some point prior to 1846 by William Barling Sharpe (who is buried with his wife, Ann, in the cemetery at Westwell, and his daughter, Elizabeth Louisa, who married William Francis Winch). The brewery assumed the name Sharpe &amp; Winch in 1892, and was purchased and taken over by Frederick Leney &amp; Sons Ltd, a Wateringbury company, in 1927. The brewery were responsible for the mock-Tudor extension to the 18th century &quot;Baker&#x27;s Cross House&quot; (a Grade II listed building).

== Culture and community ==
During the 19th century, a group of artists known as the &quot;Cranbrook Colony&quot; were located here. The Colony artists tended to paint scenes of domestic life in rural Kent – cooking and washing, children playing, and other family activities.

Queen&#x27;s Hall Theatre, part of Cranbrook School, sponsors many theatre groups, including the Cambridge Footlights and Cranbrook Operatic and Dramatic Society (CODS). Cranbrook Town Band, founded in the 1920s, is a British-style brass band, which performs regular concerts in the Queen&#x27;s Hall, St Dunstan&#x27;s Church and around Kent.

There have been many plans to create a community hub, starting with a proposal to convert the old council offices. The focus then switched to a £2m building planned on Wilkes Field, next to the Co-op carpark. plans included small community rooms and three large day rooms which could convert into a hall for 300 people, along with a day care centre, council offices, public toilets and even the police station. In April 2016 residents voted against the parish council taking out the £2m loan required for the project, but in September 2016 the Borough Council approved a £20m regeneration plan that would create shops, flats and a community centre.

== Cultural references ==
Cranbrook is the name of a hymn tune written by Canterbury cobbler Thomas Clark around 1805, and later used as a tune for the Christmas hymn &quot;While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks&quot;. The tune later became associated with the Yorkshire song &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot;.

== Landmarks ==
There are many medieval buildings in the area. At Wilsley Green, to the north of the town, is a Grade I-listed Wealden hall house and cloth hall that dates to the late 14th century. There are a number of medieval cloth halls around the town – the George Hotel is in one dating to 1400, there are two more further down the High St on the north side dating from the late 15th century and 16th century. There are 15th century examples at Goddards Green Farm on Angley Rd, Hill House on The Hill, and on Friezley Lane.

Glassenbury Park is a late-15th-century manor house on the road to Goudhurst with a 1730s front block, remodelled in 1877–79 by Anthony Salvia. Wilsley Hotel was originally built in 1864–70 as a home for the Colony artist John Callcott Horsley, designer of the first Christmas card twenty years earlier. The architect was Richard Norman Shaw in his first important domestic commission. The war memorial was erected on Angley Road in 1920.

=== Windmills ===

Over the years there have been four windmills in and around Cranbrook of which only the Union Mill survives and dominates the local skyline. It was built in 1814 for Henry Dobell, who went bankrupt five years later. Then the mill was run by a union of creditors until 1832. The Russell family ran it for the next 128 years, when it was sold to Kent County Council, who have restored it. The mill is kept in working order to this day. It stands ¼ mile (400 m) southeast of the church.

Cranbrook Common smock mill had common sails and was winded by hand. It was marked on the Ordnance Survey map covering the area which was published between 1858 and 1872. The mill was last worked in 1876 and was demolished on 9 August 1902. The mill stood 1¾ miles (2.8 km) north north east of the church.

Windmill Hill is thought to have been home to a smock mill that was moved to Sissinghurst c. 1814. It stood ¼ mile (400 m) west north west of the church. This mill was marked on Emanuel Bowen&#x27;s map of Kent (1736) and also on Andrews, Drury and Herbert&#x27;s map of Kent, 1769. The latter also shows a mill at Saint&#x27;s Hill, 1 mile 5 furlongs (2.6 km) north east of the church.

== Transport ==
The junction of the A262 (Lamberhurst – Biddenden) and the A229 (Rochester – Hawkhurst) pass near Cranbrook. Cranbrook is served by Arriva Southern Counties buses.

The Hawkhurst Branch Line ran a short distance from the town, but Cranbrook railway station, which was southwest of the centre, stopped operations on 12 June 1961. The nearest operating station is at Staplehurst.

== Education ==
Rainbow Pre-school provides early years education in the centre of town. Cranbrook Church of England Primary School has been on its current site in Carriers Road since 1985; it was placed in special measures from November 2013 until June 2015. Colliers Green Primary School also lies within the parish, to the north-west of Cranbrook. Dulwich Preparatory School (3–13) at Coursehorn to the east of town, is a legacy of the World War II evacuation of Dulwich College Preparatory School from London. Alumni include Sophie, Countess of Wessex and its buildings include two cloth halls, one dating from the 15th century and one from the 16th century.

Cranbrook School (13–18) is a voluntary-aided grammar school, dating back to 1518. A third of the pupils are boarders. The schoolhouse built in 1727 is now the Headmaster&#x27;s House. The school&#x27;s observatory is named after alumnus and NASA astronaut Piers Sellers; it houses the 22.5 inch Alan Young telescope operated by the Cranbrook and District Science and Astronomy Society (CADSAS).

High Weald Academy (11–18), formerly known as Angley School, was a comprehensive school. It was formed by the merger of Mary Sheafe Girls&#x27; School and Swattenden Boys&#x27; School in the 1970s and became Kent&#x27;s first specialist sports college in 2000. In September 2012 it was taken over by the Hayesbrook Academy Trust (now the Brook Learning Trust) who run the Hayesbrook School in Tonbridge. The school closed in 2022.
== Religious sites ==

St Dunstan&#x27;s Church is known as the &quot;Cathedral of the Weald&quot;; its 74 feet-high tower, completed in 1425, has a wooden figure of Father Time and his scythe on the south face. It also contains the prototype for the Big Ben clock in London.

Cranbrook Strict Baptist Chapel was built in 1787 and is the only survivor of two Strict Baptist chapels within a short distance in the village centre; Providence Chapel is now closed. Cranbrook Congregational Church was built in Neo-Gothic style in 1857, replacing an earlier chapel. It remains Congregational, having stayed outside the United Reformed Church denomination. The Catholic St Theodore&#x27;s Church opened in 1958.

== Sport ==
In 1652, a court case brought at Cranbrook by church authorities against John Rabson and others refers to &quot;a certain unlawful game called cricket&quot;, one of the sport&#x27;s earliest references. The court, however, ruled that the game was &quot;not&quot; unlawful. Kent County Cricket Club played two first-class cricket matches on School Field, Cranbrook in the 1850s and two on Swifts Park, an estate just north-east of the town, in the 1860s.

Cranbrook Juniors Football Club (CJFC) play in the Crowborough &amp; District Junior Football League. Home matches are played on the Rammell Field, Cranbrook on Saturday mornings.

Cranbrook Rugby Club (CRFC) play their home matches on the various rugby pitches situated around the town, including the Jaeger and Scott fields. The clubhouse is based at the Cranbrook Rugby Club, on Angley Road. Age groups range from Under 7s to the senior adult teams.

The Weald Sports Centre has indoor and outdoor facilities, including tennis courts, an indoor sports hall, a swimming pool and a dance studio. Cranbrook joggers club runs routes around Angley Woods and Bedgebury Forest.

There was an open-air swimming pool on the Frythe Estate, which closed when the Weald Sports Centre opened in 2000.

<text>The Servant is a 1963 British drama film directed by Joseph Losey. It was written by Harold Pinter, who adapted Robin Maugham&#x27;s 1948 novella of the same name. The film stars Dirk Bogarde, Sarah Miles, Wendy Craig and James Fox.

The first of Pinter&#x27;s three film collaborations with Losey, &quot;The Servant&quot; is a tightly constructed film about the psychological relationships among the four central characters and examines issues relating to social class.
==Plot==
Wealthy Londoner Tony, who says that he is part of a plan to build cities in Brazil, moves into his new house, and hires Hugo Barrett as his manservant. Barrett appears to take easily to his new job, and he and Tony form a quiet bond, retaining their social roles. Relationships begin shifting, however, when Tony&#x27;s girlfriend Susan meets Barrett. She is suspicious of Barrett and asks Tony to dismiss him, but he refuses.

To bring his lover, Vera, into his world, Barrett convinces Tony that the house also needs a maid. When Tony finally agrees, Barrett hires Vera on the pretext that she is his sister. Barrett encourages Vera to seduce Tony. Later, when Tony and Susan return early from a vacation, they find Barrett and Vera sleeping together. Believing that the two are siblings, he flies into a rage at Barrett, who then reveals that they are not related and she is his fiancée. He and Vera then make it clear that Tony was sleeping with her, to Susan&#x27;s dismay. After Tony dismisses them, Susan departs silently.

At this point, Tony has become reliant on Barrett and Vera. He becomes a drunkard, which is exacerbated by Susan&#x27;s refusal to answer his calls. Eventually, Tony encounters Barrett in a pub, who spins a tale about Vera having made fools of them both. He begs Tony to re-engage him as his manservant, and he agrees.

Gradually the two reverse roles, with Barrett taking more control and Tony retreating into infantilism. Barrett also insinuates Vera back into the house. Susan arrives and attempts to convince Tony to come back to her. She finds him totally dependent on Barrett who keeps him supplied with alcohol and prostitutes. She walks through the sordid scene, and suddenly kisses Barrett, who forcefully returns her attentions. As he grows more brutal, Susan struggles to free herself from his embrace, and Tony, rising from his drunken stupor, attempts to intervene. However, he trips and falls onto the floor, causing all the prostitutes to laugh at him. Tony then has an outburst and Barrett orders everyone to leave. Before departing, Susan slaps Barrett with the jeweled collar of her coat. Barrett is shocked, but quickly recovers and places her coat on her shoulder as she leaves. He then walks upstairs where Vera is waiting for him, passing Tony, who is slumped on the ground and clutching a drink.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;The Servant&quot; was directed by Joseph Losey, an American director who spent the last part of his career and life in England, after being blacklisted by Hollywood in the 1950s.
His health was poor during production, causing Bogarde to provide significant assistance with the direction and finishing the film.

The film is based on &quot;The Servant&quot;, a 1948 Robin Maugham novella. The screenplay, written by Harold Pinter, stripped the plot to a more economical and chilling storyline. Pinter also appeared in the film, as a restaurant patron in one scene with a speaking part.

Writing for the British Film Institute, film critic Nick James noted:

&quot;It was Losey who first showed Robin Maugham&#x27;s novella &quot;The Servant&quot; to Bogarde in 1954. Originally separately commissioned by director Michael Anderson, Pinter stripped it of its first-person narrator, its yellow book snobbery, and the arguably anti-Semitic characterisation of Barrett—oiliness, heavy lids—replacing them with an economical language that implied rather than stated the slippage of power relations away from Tony towards Barrett.&quot;

Losey&#x27;s other collaborations with Pinter, &quot;Accident&quot; and &quot;The Go-Between&quot;, share a resemblance to &quot;The Servant&quot; in that these offer the same savage indictment of the waning English class system, a theme which had been rarely addressed in British cinema.

==Music==
The soundtrack by John Dankworth includes the song &quot;All Gone&quot;, sung by his wife Cleo Laine. Her three different renditions of the song provide distinct emotional impacts throughout the film.

Folk guitarist Davy Graham makes a brief cameo playing the song &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;.

==Release==
The film was shown at the 24th Venice International Film Festival in September 1963. It was also selected to represent Britain at the first New York Film Festival the same month, with Losey returning to the United States for the first time in 10 years to attend the festival.

The film opened at London&#x27;s Warner Theatre on 14 November 1963.

It was re-released in 2013 to mark its 50th anniversary.

==Reception==

=== Critical ===
Upon release, &quot;Variety&quot; commended the film for its direction, acting and the &quot;sharp incisive dialog&quot; in Pinter&#x27;s screenplay, writing: &quot;&quot;The Servant&quot; is for the most part strong dramatic fare, though the atmosphere and tension is not fully sustained to the end.&quot; They also noted &quot;the standout performance by Bogarde, for whom the role of the servant is offbeat casting&quot; and &quot;the noteworthy performance of James Fox, a newcomer with confident flair, who assuredly suggests the indolent young man about town.&quot;

Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The Observer&quot; called it &quot;a triumph&quot; and wrote &quot;the thing that is most exhilarating about the film is that it has been written by someone who is obviously excited by the cinema and made by someone who obviously respects words&quot;.

Richard Roud writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Ann Pacey of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; claimed it was &quot;a masterpiece&quot;.

In 2013, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic suggested that &quot;The Servant&quot; was the coldest film ever made, calling it &quot;brilliantly icy&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a rating of 90% and an average rating of 8.1/10 from 51 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Thanks in no small part to stellar work from director Joseph Losey and screenwriter Harold Pinter, &quot;The Servant&quot; strikes at class divisions with artful precision.&quot;

On Metacritic, it holds an average rating of 94/100, based on the reviews of nine critics.

=== Box office ===
The film grossed £238,893 in the United Kingdom and £150,383 overseas for a worldwide total of £389,276.

In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked &quot;The Servant&quot; as the 22nd-greatest British film of all time.

==Retrospective appraisal==
Critic Robert Maras, art critic at the World Socialist Web Site notes the significant of the film among Losey’s contemporaries:&quot;&quot;The Servant&quot; was widely praised in European filmmaking circles and helped encourage a period of greater social and psychological realism in British cinema.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot;, critic Dan Callahan reports that &quot;The Servant&quot; “consolidated” Losey’s reputation internationally.

Film historian David Thomson writes:

==Home media==
In 2001, &quot;The Servant&quot; was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment. In June 2023, a 4K digital restoration of the film was released on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection.

<doc id="1086040" wikidata="Q586868" url="?curid=1086040" title="Ipatovo kurgan">
<text>Ipatovo kurgan refers to kurgan 2 of the Ipatovo Barrow Cemetery 3, a cemetery of kurgan burial mounds, located near the town of Ipatovo in Stavropol Krai, Russia, some northeast of Stavropol.

With a height of , it was one of the largest kurgans in the area. It was completely investigated in 1998–1999, revealing thirteen phases of construction and use, from the 4th millennium BCE to the 18th century.

The first grave may have been a burial of the Maykop culture, which was destroyed by later graves. The earliest extant grave contained two young people, buried in a sitting position, dating to the late 4th millennium.

The large Ipatovo mound displayed three wagon burials of the Early and Late Catacomb cultures 

On top of the kurgan was a Sarmatian grave of the 3rd century BCE. A woman had been buried here in extended position on the back, together with an exceptionally rich treasure of grave-goods: six solid golden necklets, two golden spiral bracelets, two golden finger rings made from Hellenistic coins, a gilded wooden cup decorated with zoomorphic figures, a short sword with gold-decorated pommel (the presence of a weapon in a woman&#x27;s grave is not an unusual feature in Sarmatian contexts) and a gold-covered scabbard, a sheet gold buckle, a gilded wooden cosmetics container, and clay vessels.

In the final phase, over one hundred simple graves were dug into the southern slope of the barrow; probably 18th century burials of the nomadic Turkic Nogai people.

<doc id="1086042" wikidata="Q1058871" url="?curid=1086042" title="WWE New Year's Revolution">
<text>WWE New Year&#x27;s Revolution is a professional wrestling event produced by WWE, a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 2005 and its name is a play on the Western tradition of New Year&#x27;s resolutions, being held in early January each year the event is produced.

It was originally held as a pay-per-view (PPV) event from 2005 to 2007. To coincide with WWE&#x27;s brand extension, New Year&#x27;s Revolution was held exclusively for wrestlers from the Raw brand for its three years as a PPV event. In 2008, New Year&#x27;s Revolution was removed from the schedule when the company reduced the number of PPVs per year after the discontinuation of brand-exclusive PPVs following WrestleMania 23 in April 2007. In January 2020, WWE revived the event&#x27;s name for a series of WWE Live shows for Raw and SmackDown titled the New Year&#x27;s Revolution Tour; this tour was not held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The name was used again for a special episode of &quot;Friday Night SmackDown&quot; on January 5, 2024.

The PPV event was notable for featuring the Elimination Chamber match during its first two years. Also notable was the 2006 event, which saw the first Money in the Bank cash-in match. After John Cena had retained the WWE Championship in an Elimination Chamber match, Edge used his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Cena to win the championship.

==History==
New Year&#x27;s Revolution was an annual January pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The name was a play on the Western tradition of New Year&#x27;s resolutions. The first New Year&#x27;s Revolution took place on January 9, 2005, and aired live on PPV from San Juan, Puerto Rico, which was the first PPV event produced by WWE to be held in Puerto Rico. The main event was an Elimination Chamber match, a special elimination-based professional wrestling match type that was promoted on rare occasions in WWE at that time with a total of six participants. The original Elimination Chamber structure was 16-feet-high and weighed 10-tons. It was composed of two miles of chain, steel grating, and plexiglass pods (two wrestlers started the match while the other four were contained in the pods with one each let into the match at random every five minutes). 

The 2006 event also featured an Elimination Chamber match as the main event, which also saw the first Money in the Bank cash-in, where Mr. Money in the Bank Edge used the contract and defeated WWE Champion John Cena right after Cena had retained the title in the Elimination Chamber match. The annual Elimination Chamber match was then moved to the December to Dismember PPV later that year, thus the 2007 New Year&#x27;s Revolution event did not feature the Elimination Chamber match. The New Year&#x27;s Revolution PPV was then canceled in 2008, after WWE reduced the number of PPVs per year after the discontinuation of brand-exclusive PPVs following WrestleMania 23 in April 2007.

In 2002, WWE held a draft that split its roster into two distinctive brands of wrestling, Raw and SmackDown, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. New Year&#x27;s Revolution was produced exclusively for wrestlers of the Raw brand all three years the PPV was held. In April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name with the &quot;WWE&quot; abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism.

In January 2020, after 13 years since the 2007 PPV, WWE revived the New Year&#x27;s Revolution name for a series of WWE Live shows called the New Year&#x27;s Revolution Tour, which were held as supershows, featuring wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown. The tour began on January 4 and was scheduled for a total of nine shows. The tour was cut short as the ninth and final show, which was scheduled for March 15, had to be canceled due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic just a few days beforehand. The pandemic caused WWE to suspend its live touring schedule until July 2021, thus a New Year&#x27;s Revolution Tour was not held that year.

While not part of the New Year&#x27;s Revolution chronology, WWE reintroduced a New Year&#x27;s-themed event, which took place as the January 6, 2021, episode of &quot;NXT&quot; entitled , a name previously used by former rival World Championship Wrestling for a December 1999 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. WWE also produced a 2022 pay-per-view event called Day 1, which unlike New Year&#x27;s Revolution, it took place on New Year&#x27;s Day itself, and it was WWE&#x27;s first PPV and livestreaming event to take place on New Year&#x27;s Day.

During the December 22, 2023, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, the brand&#x27;s General Manager Nick Aldis announced the revival of New Year&#x27;s Revolution. It was scheduled to be held as a special episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on January 5, 2024, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This in turn marked the first SmackDown-branded New Year&#x27;s Revolution, the first to air as a television special, and the fourth overall to be broadcast on any outlet. It was also the final event in WWE&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Knockout Week, a week-long programming of New Year&#x27;s-themed shows.

==Reception==
The 2005 event never reached Billboard.com&#x27;s top ten list for Recreational Sports DVDs. The first week the event appeared on the Billboard chart, it ranked 19th. The following week, the event ranked 17th, only to drop off the chart the next week. The 2006 event ranked third on its first week in the chart&#x27;s top ten list. The following week, the DVD reached second on the list, and remained in the top ten for five weeks until the week of April 8, 2006, when the event dropped to 11th. The 2007 event ranked second in its first week in the top ten. The DVD remained in the top ten for four weeks until the week of March 31, 2007, when it ranked 11th.

&quot;Canadian Online Explorer&quot;&#x27;s professional wrestling section rated the 2005 event a three out of ten stars. The main event was rated a seven out of ten stars. The 2006 event was given a rating of three out of ten stars also, with the main event being rated six out of ten stars. The 2007 event was rated six out of ten stars, the highest for the PPV&#x27;s three-year run. The main event for 2007 was given a six out of ten stars rating, the same as the previous year&#x27;s main event.

==Events==
===Pay-per-view and televised events (2005–2007, 2024)===
As a pay-per-view event, only three New Year&#x27;s Revolutions were held, beginning in 2005 with the final in 2007. All three events were held exclusively for wrestlers from the Raw brand. The 2024 event was a SmackDown-exclusive show as it was held as a television special episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;.


===New Year&#x27;s Revolution Tour (2020)===
The New Year&#x27;s Revolution Tour was originally scheduled to be a tour of nine WWE Live shows, however, the final show was canceled due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ninth and final show had been scheduled to be held on March 15 at the Covelli Centre in Youngstown, Ohio, but Ohio governor Mike DeWine issued a ban of mass gatherings of over 100 people or more. Below are the eight shows that were held for the 2020 tour. These house shows were held as supershows, featuring wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown.

<doc id="1086069" wikidata="Q5645969" url="?curid=1086069" title="Hampden, New Zealand">
<text>Hampden, a small town in North Otago, New Zealand, lies close to the North Otago coast, 35 kilometres south of Oamaru and 80 kilometres north of the city of Dunedin, to both of which it is connected by State Highway 1.

The township&#x27;s population at its largest was about 560, but by 2009 it had dwindled to approximately 230. Hampden is named in honour of the English politician John Hampden by early surveyor W. B. D. Mantell, possibly influenced by the location of a public house, The Hampden Hotel, at the site.

==Geography==
Hampden is situated beside a broad bay stretching from Aorere Point to Moeraki Point, on a coastal plain which rises westward to the foothills of the Horse Range and the Kakanui Range. The soil of this surrounding plain overlies a limestone formation. The Moeraki Boulders are located two kilometres south of Hampden. Much of the town lies between the Big Kuri (Kurinui) and Little Kuri Creeks.

The streets of Hampden run in a rectangular grid pattern centred on the main highway and the railway. They are named after English locations, such as Lancaster, Shrewsbury, Worcester, and Norfolk. There is surfing on the Kātiki straight, as well as trout-fishing in the Waianakarua and Shag Rivers.

==History==
The settlement was founded in the 1860s, with the first sale of land sections dated to March 1863. By 1865, there were two public houses in the area, The Hampden Hotel and The Clyde Hotel, and both a cemetery and mechanics&#x27; institute were in place by 1870. early industry in the area included the harvesting of flax and timber.

A borough was proclaimed in 1879, with the first mayor being William Murcott. The borough existed until the 1960s, and Hampden is now part of the Waitaki District.

==Demographics==
Hampden is described as a rural settlement by Statistics New Zealand, and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the larger Waihemo statistical area.

There were 156 households, comprising 156 males and 177 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.88 males per female, with 48 people (14.2%) aged under 15 years, 30 (8.8%) aged 15 to 29, 168 (49.6%) aged 30 to 64, and 90 (26.5%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 86.7% European/Pākehā, 15.9% Māori, 1.8% Pasifika, and 2.7% Asian. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 54.9% had no religion, 34.5% were Christian, 0.9% were Hindu and 1.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 30 (10.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 81 (27.8%) people had no formal qualifications. 18 people (6.2%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally.

Sheep farming is the primary economic activity of the region and is augmented by farming of other livestock.

The Hampden Energy Forum, established in 2007, has grown into a community self-help scheme that involves nearly everyone in the settlement, growing from a small group of enthusiasts who were concerned about the future of small rural communities in &quot;post-oil&quot; days. At the inaugural meeting to establish the Forum, more than one third of the town&#x27;s population attended. The forum won the Trustpower Community Award in 2008.

<text>Percy Morris Beard (January 26, 1908 – March 27, 1990) was an American college and international track and field athlete who specialized in the high hurdles event, and won an Olympic silver medal. Beard later became a nationally prominent college track and field coach at the University of Florida.

== Athletic career ==

Percy Beard was born in Hardinsburg, Kentucky in 1908. He became a world-class hurdler at Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now Auburn University) in Auburn, Alabama. After graduating from Auburn with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil engineering in 1929, he later competed for the New York Athletic Club in Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) competition. He set a world record of 14.2 seconds in the 120-yard high hurdles in 1931 and tied the record again in 1934. A seven-time national AAU high hurdles champion, Beard won the silver medal in the 110-meter high hurdles event at the 1932 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, finishing second behind U.S. teammate George Saling.

== Coaching career ==

Following his competition running career, Beard later became the head coach of the Florida Gators track and field at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, serving from 1937 to 1964. Under Beard, the Gators won the Southeastern Conference (SEC) outdoor track and field championship twice and were the runners-up four times. While he was the Gators&#x27; head coach, he founded the Florida Relays in 1939, which became one of the country&#x27;s top collegiate track and field events. He used his Auburn civil engineering background to develop all-weather running tracks and unveiled the first full-scale all-weather track at the 1959 Florida Relays.

== Legacy and honors ==

Beard was a member of the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Hall of Fame, and was elected to the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1981. The University of Florida honored Beard by naming its track and field facility, Percy Beard Track, for him in 1978. He was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as an &quot;honorary letter winner&quot; in 1976.

Beard died in Gainesville in 1990; he was 82 years old. He was survived by his wife Sara, and their three sons.

<text>Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) models are often presented without clarifying the viewpoint represented by the model. By default, these models denote an implementation viewpoint that visualises the structure of a computer program. Mixed viewpoints do not support the fundamental separation of interfaces from implementation details, which is one of the primary benefits of the object-oriented paradigm.

In object-oriented analysis and design there are three viewpoints: The business viewpoint (the information that is domain specific and matters to the end user), the specification viewpoint (which defines the exposed interface elements of a class), and the implementation viewpoint (which deals with the actual internal implementation of the class). If the viewpoint becomes mixed then these elements will blend together in a way which makes it difficult to separate out and maintain the internals of an object without changing the interface, one of the core tenets of object-oriented analysis and design.

<text>The Moeraki Boulders (officially Moeraki Boulders / Kaihinaki) are unusually large spherical boulders lying along a stretch of Koekohe Beach on the wave-cut Otago coast of New Zealand between Moeraki and Hampden. They occur scattered either as isolated or clusters of boulders within a stretch of beach where they have been protected in a scientific reserve. These boulders are grey-coloured septarian concretions, which have been exhumed from the mudstone and bedrock enclosing them and concentrated on the beach by coastal erosion. Especially in recent years, the boulders have been a popular tourist attraction.

== Description ==
The most striking aspect of the boulders is their unusually large size and spherical shape, with a distinct bimodal size distribution. Approximately one-third of the boulders range in size from about in diameter, the other two-thirds from . Most are spherical or almost spherical, but a small proportion are slightly elongated parallel to the bedding plane of the mudstone that once enclosed them.

Neither the spherical to subspherical shape or large size of the Moeraki Boulders is unique to them. Virtually identical spherical boulders, called Koutu Boulders, are found on the beaches, in the cliffs, and beneath the surface inland of the shore of Hokianga Harbour, North Island, New Zealand, between Koutu and Kauwhare points. Like the Moeraki Boulders, the Koutu Boulders are large, reaching in diameter, and almost spherical. Similar boulder-size concretions, known as Katiki Boulders, are also found on the north-facing shore of Shag Point some south of where the Moeraki Boulders are found. These concretions occur as both spherical cannonball concretions and flat, disk-shaped or oval concretions. Unlike the Moeraki boulders, some of these concretions contain the bones of mosasaurs and plesiosaurs.

Similar large spherical concretions have been found in many other countries.

== Composition ==

Detailed analysis of the fine-grained rock using optical mineralogy, X-ray crystallography, and electron microprobe has determined that the boulders consist of mud, fine silt and clay, cemented by calcite. The degree of cementation varies from being relatively weak in the interior of a boulder to quite hard at its outside rim. The outside rims of the larger boulders consist of as much as 10 to 20% calcite because the calcite not only tightly cements the silt and clay but has also replaced it to a significant degree.

The rock comprising the bulk of a boulder is riddled with large cracks called septaria that radiate outward from a hollow core lined with scalenohedral calcite crystals. The process or processes that created septaria within Moeraki Boulders, and in other septarian concretions, remain an unresolved matter for which a number of possible explanations have been proposed. These cracks radiate and thin outward from the centre of the typical boulder and are typically filled with an outer (early stage) layer of brown calcite and an inner (late stage) layer of yellow calcite spar, which often, but not always, completely fills the cracks. Rare Moeraki Boulders have a very thin innermost (latest stage) layer of dolomite and quartz covering the yellow calcite spar.

The composition of the Moeraki Boulders and the septaria that they contain are typical of, often virtually identical to, septarian concretions that have been found in exposures of sedimentary rocks in New Zealand and elsewhere. Smaller but otherwise very similar septarian concretions are found within exposures of sedimentary rocks elsewhere in New Zealand. Similar septarian concretions have been found in the Kimmeridge Clay and Oxford Clay of England, and at many other locations worldwide.

== Origin ==
The Moeraki Boulders are concretions created by the cementation of the Paleocene mudstone of the Moeraki Formation, from which they have been exhumed by coastal erosion. The main body of the boulders started forming in what was then marine mud, near the surface of the Paleocene seafloor. This is demonstrated by studies of their composition; specifically the magnesium and iron content, and stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon. Their spherical shape indicates that the source of calcium was mass diffusion, as opposed to fluid flow. The larger boulders, in diameter, are estimated to have taken 4 to 5.5 million years to grow while of marine mud accumulated on the seafloor above them. After the concretions formed, large cracks known as &quot;septaria&quot; formed in them. Brown calcite, yellow calcite, and small amounts of dolomite and quartz progressively filled these cracks when a sea level drop allowed fresh groundwater to flow through the mudstone enclosing them.

== Documentation and oral tradition ==

Local Māori legends explained the boulders as the remains of eel baskets, calabashes, and kūmara washed ashore from the wreck of Āraiteuru, a large sailing canoe. This legend tells of the rocky shoals that extend seaward from Shag Point as being the petrified hull of this wreck and a nearby rocky promontory as being the body of the canoe&#x27;s captain. Their reticulated patterning on the boulders, according to this legend, are the remains of the canoe&#x27;s fishing nets.

In 1848, Walter Mantell sketched the beach and its boulders, more numerous than now. The picture is now in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington.

Swiss manufacturers originally launched Araldite DIY adhesive products in 1946. The first batches of Araldite epoxy resins, for which the brand is best known, were made in Duxford, England in 1950.

Araldite adhesive sets by the interaction of an epoxy resin with a hardener. Mixing an epoxy resin and hardener together starts a chemical reaction that produces heat – an exothermic reaction.
It is claimed that after curing the bond is impervious to boiling water and to all common organic solvents.

== History ==
Aero Research Limited (ARL), founded in the UK in 1934, developed a new synthetic-resin adhesive for bonding metals, glass, porcelain, china and other materials. The name &quot;Araldite&quot; recalls the ARL brand: &quot;ARaLdite&quot;. 

De Trey Frères SA of Switzerland carried out the first production of epoxy resins. They licensed the process to Ciba AG in the early 1940s and Ciba first demonstrated a product under the tradename &quot;Araldite&quot; at the Swiss Industries Fair in 1945. Ciba went on to become one of the three major epoxy-resin producers worldwide. Ciba&#x27;s epoxy business was spun off and later sold in the late 1990s and became the advanced materials business unit of Huntsman Corporation of the US.

== Notable applications ==
* Despite a widespread myth, Araldite was not used in the production of the De Havilland Mosquito aircraft in the 1940s. Another Aero Research Limited glue was used, called Aerolite, which was not an epoxy resin, but a gap-filling urea-formaldehyde adhesive. 
*Araldite adhesive is used to join together the two sections of carbon composite which make up the monocoque of the Lamborghini Aventador.
* The use of Araldite adhesive in architecture to bond thin joints of pre-cast concrete units was pioneered by Ove Arup in Coventry cathedral and the Sydney Opera House. At Coventry cathedral, Araldite adhesive was used to bond its columns and fins, while at Sydney Opera House, Araldite adhesive was used to bond the rib sections of the shells, since a traditional concrete joint would have slowed construction, as it would need 24 hours to cure before stressing.
* Highmark Manufacturing uses Araldite epoxy resin in the manufacture of advanced ballistic protection body armour.
* Schlösser Metallbau, a manufacturer of metal parts for railway carriages, uses Araldite epoxy resin to bond aluminium profiles of cab doorframes on the DBAG Class 423 Siemens Bombardier train.
* Fischer Composite Technology GmbH uses the Araldite RTM System to produce carbon composite side blades for the Audi R8.
* Araldite epoxy resin is commonly used as an embedding medium for electron microscopy.
* Some Flamenco guitarists (e.g. Paco Peña) use it to reinforce their fingernails.
* Brian May used it to seal some of the pickups in his homemade Red Special guitar to reduce microphonic feedback.

== Advertising ==
In 1983, British advertising agency FCO Univas set up a visual stunt presentation of the strength of Araldite adhesive by gluing a yellow Ford Cortina to a billboard on Cromwell Road, London, with the tagline &quot;It also sticks handles to teapots&quot;. Later, further to advertise the strength of Araldite, a red Cortina was placed on top of the yellow Cortina, with the tagline &quot;The tension mounts&quot;. Finally, the cars were removed, leaving a hole on the billboard and a tagline &quot;How did we pull it off?&quot;.

<text>Stephen Batchelor (born 7 April 1953) is a Scottish Buddhist author and teacher, known for his writings on Buddhist subjects and his leadership of meditation retreats worldwide. He is a noted proponent of agnostic or secular Buddhism.

== Early life and early education ==
Batchelor was born in Dundee, Scotland, in 1953. When he was three years old, his family relocated briefly to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where his parents separated. He relocated with his mother Phyllis (b. 1913) to England, where he was raised in a humanist environment with his younger brother David in Watford, Hertfordshire. He attended Watford Grammar School for Boys, leaving in February 1972.

==Buddhism studies and career==
At age eighteen, he embarked on an overland journey which eventually led him to India. He settled in Dharamsala, the capital-in-exile of the Dalai Lama, and studied with Geshé Ngawang Dhargyey at the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives. He was ordained as a novice monk in the Gelug tradition in 1974. A few months after ordination, he sat a ten-day Vipassana meditation retreat with the Indian teacher S.N. Goenka, which proved a lasting influence on his practice, and aroused his curiosity about other traditions of Buddhism.

He left India in 1975 to study Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and doctrine under the guidance of Geshe Rabten. He initially studied at the Tibet Institute Rikon and later in Le Mont-Pèlerin, both located in Switzerland. During this time, he also assisted Geshé Rabten in establishing the Tharpa Choeling, which is now known as Rabten Choeling. The following year, he received full ordination as a monk. In 1979 he moved to Germany to work as a translator for Geshé Thubten Ngawang at the Tibetisches Institut in Hamburg.

In April 1981, Batchelor travelled to Songgwangsa Monastery in South Korea to undergo training in Zen Buddhism under the guidance of Kusan Sunim. At the monastery, he met Martine Fages, a Frenchwoman who had ordained as a nun in 1975. He remained in Korea until the autumn of 1984, when he left for a pilgrimage to Buddhist sites in Japan, China and Tibet.

Following the death of Kusan Sunim, Batchelor and Martine Fages laicised in February 1985 and married in Hong Kong, then returned to England and joined the Sharpham North Community near Totnes, Devon. Over the course of the next fifteen years Batchelor lived at Sharpham, he became coordinator of the Sharpham Trust (1992) and co-founder of the Sharpham College for Buddhist Studies and Contemporary Enquiry (1996). Throughout this period he worked as a Buddhist chaplain at Channings Wood Prison. From 1990 he has been a Guiding Teacher at Gaia House meditation centre in Devon and since 1992 a contributing editor of &quot;&quot;. In August 2000, he and Martine moved to Aquitaine, France, where they live in a village near Bordeaux.

As a lay Buddhist author, teacher, and self-designated scholar, he has increasingly turned his attention to the earliest teachings of Buddhism as recorded in the Pali canon. Additionally, he has shown an increasing interest in Hellenistic philosophies, particularly the skeptical philosophy of Pyrrhonism and Montaigne&#x27;s approach to Pyrrhonism.

Batchelor is a member of the core faculty of Bodhi College, which focuses on interpreting the early texts of Buddhism, such as the Pali Canon, in a manner applicable to the modern world. He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Center for Pragmatic Buddhism.

<doc id="1086083" wikidata="Q4384383" url="?curid=1086083" title="X-ray absorption fine structure">
<text>X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is a specific structure observed in X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). By analyzing the XAFS, information can be acquired on the local structure and on the unoccupied local electronic states.
==Atomic spectra==

The atomic X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) of a core-level in an absorbing atom is separated into states in the discrete part of the spectrum called &quot;bounds final states&quot; or &quot;Rydberg states&quot; below the ionization potential (IP) and &quot;states in the continuum&quot; part of the spectrum above the ionization potential due to excitations of the photoelectron in the vacuum. Above the IP the absorption cross section attenuates gradually with the X-ray energy. 
Following early experimental and theoretical works in the thirties, in the sixties using synchrotron radiation at the National Bureau of Standards it was established that the broad asymmetric absorption peaks are due to Fano resonances above the atomic ionization potential where the final states are many body quasi-bound states (i.e., a doubly excited atom) degenerate with the continuum.

==Spectra of molecules and condensed matter==

The XAS spectra of condensed matter are usually divided in three energy regions:

===Edge region===

The edge region usually extends in a range of few eV around the absorption edge. The spectral features in the edge region i) in good metals are excitations to final delocalized states above the Fermi level; ii) in insulators are core excitons below the ionization potential; iii) in molecules are electronic transitions to the first unoccupied molecular levels above the chemical potential in the initial states which are shifted into the discrete part of the core absorption spectrum by the Coulomb interaction with the core hole. Multi-electron excitations and configuration interaction between many body final states dominate the edge region in strongly correlated metals and insulators.
For many years the edge region was referred to as the “Kossel structure” but now it is known as &quot;absorption edge region&quot; since the Kossel structure refers only to unoccupied molecular final states which is a correct description only for few particular cases: molecules and strongly disordered systems.

=== X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure ===

The XANES energy region extends between the edge region and the EXAFS region over a 50-100 eV energy range around the core level x-ray absorption threshold.
Before 1980 the XANES region was wrongly assigned to different final states: a) unoccupied total density of states, or b) unoccupied molecular orbitals (kossel structure) or c) unoccupied atomic orbitals or d) low energy EXAFS oscillations.
In the seventies, using synchrotron radiation in Frascati and Stanford synchrotron sources, it was experimentally shown that the features in this energy region are due to multiple scattering resonances of the photoelectron in a nanocluster of variable size. Antonio Bianconi in 1980 invented the acronym XANES to indicate the spectral region dominated by multiple scattering resonances of the photoelectron in the soft x-ray range
and in the hard X-ray range.
In the XANES energy range the kinetic energy of the photoelectron in the final state is between few eV and 50-100 eV. In this regime the photoelectron has a strong scattering amplitude by neighboring atoms in molecules and condensed matter, its wavelength is larger than interatomic distances, its mean free path could be smaller than one nanometer and finally the lifetime of the excited state is in the order of femtoseconds.
The XANES spectral features are described by full multiple scattering theory proposed in the early seventies.
Therefore, the key step for XANES interpretation is the determination of the size of the atomic cluster of neighbor atoms, where the final states are confined, which could range from 0.2 nm to 2 nm in different systems.
This energy region has been called later (in 1982) also near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), which is synonymous with XANES.
During more than 20 years the XANES interpretation has been object of discussion but recently there is agreement that the final states are &quot;multiple scattering resonances&quot; and many body final states play an important role.

=== Intermediate region ===

There is an intermediate region between the XANES and EXAFS regions where low n-body distribution functions play a key role.

=== Extended X-ray absorption fine structure ===

The oscillatory structure extending for hundreds of electron volts past the edges was called the “Kronig structure” after the scientist, Ralph Kronig, who assigned this structure in the high energy range ( i.e., for a kinetic energy range - larger than 100 eV - of the photoelectron in the weak scattering regime) to the single scattering of the excited photoelectron by neighbouring atoms in molecules and condensed matter. 
This regime was called EXAFS in 1971 by Sayers, Stern and Lytle. 

 and it developed only after the use of intense synchrotron radiation sources.

== Applications of x-ray absorption spectroscopy ==
X-ray absorption edge spectroscopy corresponds to the transition from a core-level to an unoccupied orbital or band and mainly reflects the electronic unoccupied states. EXAFS, resulting from the interference in the single scattering process of the photoelectron scattered by surrounding atoms, provides information on the local structure. Information on the geometry of the local structure is provided by the analysis of the multiple scattering peaks in the XANES spectra.
The XAFS acronym has been later introduced to indicate the sum of the XANES and EXAFS spectra.

<text>Wrightbus is a Northern Irish bus manufacturer and a pioneer of the low-floor bus. The company was established in 1946 by Robert Wright and was later run by his son William Wright, until it was acquired in 2019 by British businessman Jo Bamford.

==History==
===1940s to 1970s – Early years===
Wrightbus was founded in 1946 as Robert Wright &amp; Son Coachbuilders. In its early years it rebodied lorries. In 1978, the company released its first aluminium-structured bus bodywork.

===1990s – Breakthrough into bus bodybuilding sector===

Wright&#x27;s breakthrough into the mainstream bus bodybuilding sector came in the early 1990s. The Handybus was a midibus body offered on a variety of chassis but was most successful on the emerging Dennis Dart, attracting reasonably-sized orders from a variety of operators including London Buses, Go Ahead Northern, Ulsterbus and Citybus (Belfast). This was followed by a move into the full-size single deck market with the Endeavour which was fitted to Dennis Javelin, Leyland Tiger and Scania K93 chassis, and enabled Wright to develop its highly successful Endurance body which competed with the Alexander Strider and Northern Counties Paladin for orders on Volvo B10B and Scania N113CRB chassis.

Other Wright products introduced in this period included two Mercedes-Benz-based products, the O405 based Cityranger and the OH1416 based Urbanranger. The latter was launched around the time bus operators in the UK began switching to low floor chassis and consequently only attracted a handful of orders. However, Wright had become well established in the bus bodybuilding sector by then, and was able to exploit the opportunities the low-floor revolution would offer it from the mid-1990s onwards.

====Low-floor====
In 1993, the Pathfinder on low floor Dennis Lance SLF and Scania N113CRL chassis was unveiled.

The Axcess-Ultralow was introduced in 1995 and offered on the Scania L113 chassis. At this time it was selling in reasonable numbers to UK bus operators, but unlike other bodybuilders who could only offer the L113 with step-entrance bodies, Wright modified it by removing the middle section of the chassis and thus offered UK bus operators one of the first mainstream low-floor body/chassis combinations. A major customer for the Axcess-Ultralow was FirstGroup, taking approximately 240.

Next up was the Volvo B10L based Liberator introduced at the end of 1995: National Express ordered 120 in 1997. This would be followed by the Renown body built on the Volvo B10BLE chassis, which went on to become the standard bus of the Blazefield Group.

===2000s===

Robert Wright &amp; Son was restructured in 2000, with the bus building operation rebranded to Wrightbus as a part of the Wright Group. Companies formed alongside Wrightbus in the Wright Group were Expotech, handling the export of the group&#x27;s technologies and international joint ventures such as Chance Coaches, and CustomCare, an aftermarket support operation servicing buses delivered by both Wrightbus and other bus manufacturers.

After production of the Volvo B10BLE ceased in 2001, Wrightbus developed the Wright Eclipse body for the new Volvo B7L chassis, which, due to its vertical rear engine, was not popular with many operators. Nevertheless, Wright did not lose custom and many operators such as Ulsterbus switched to the incline-engined Scania L94UB, on a similar Wright Solar body. Another bodywork which resembles the Solar/Eclipse range is the Meridian, which was bodied on the MAN A22 full low-floor single-deck chassis.

Wrightbus&#x27; first double-decker bus, the Wright Eclipse Gemini, was launched on the Volvo B7TL chassis in 2001. A similarly-styled bus entered service with Arriva London in August 2003 as the Wright Pulsar Gemini on the VDL DB250 chassis. Large operators of Gemini-bodied Wrightbus buses included Arriva, the FirstGroup, the Go-Ahead Group, Lothian Buses and National Express&#x27; West Midlands, Coventry and Dundee operations.

In November 2004, Wrightbus announced it was returning to producing bodies for minibuses at the Coach &amp; Bus 2004 expo with the launch of the low-floor Satellite body, which was to be built on the Iveco Daily-based Irisbus LoGo 65C17 chassis cowl. The body, capable of seating between 24 and 28 passengers with room for a wheelchair through the application of a drop-centre frame, was expected to be launched in mid-2005. In July 2005, however, Wrightbus announced that the Wright Satellite had been place on &#x27;indefinite hold&#x27; in favour of further developing the Wright StreetCar and other Euro IV products.

===2010s===

One of the company&#x27;s most notable products is the New Routemaster London bus, introduced in February 2012 as an update of the AEC Routemaster. Production ended in 2017 when the 1,000th New Routemaster left the production line.

Since May 2013, Wrightbus began building its own chassis, the StreetLite single-decker and StreetDeck double decker. However, they still continue to produce bodywork for the Volvo B5TL, Volvo B5LH and Volvo B8RLE.

In 2016, the Wright SRM was introduced on the Volvo B5LH. It was an adaptation of the New Routemaster body onto Volvo&#x27;s hybrid chassis at a shorter length of , with only six sold to RATP Dev subsidiary London United that same year.

====Administration and acquisition by Jo Bamford====
Between September and October 2019, Wrightbus entered administration with the suspension of 1,300 jobs at its factory. At the time Deloitte was appointed as the company&#x27;s administrators, Wrightbus was £60 million in debt, with £38.1 million of that debt owed to the Bank of Ireland.

During the six years prior to Wrightbus going into administration, it was reported that Jeff Wright, the owner of the company, had donated £15 million to a church he had founded in 2007, Green Pastures Church. This led to protests on 29 September 2019 which were joined by many of the company&#x27;s former workers, including members of the Wright family.

On 11 October 2019, a deal was reached in principle between Jo Bamford (son of Anthony Bamford, chairman of the construction equipment manufacturer JCB) and the Wright family for the land used by the factory, a sticking point in negotiations to sell the firm. A deal was made with the administrators eleven days later, with Jo Bamford&#x27;s Bamford Bus Company concluding a takeover of the company.

Since the takeover of Wrightbus, Bamford has been committed to creating a market for hydrogen buses with a reconfigured StreetDeck that is powered by hydrogen. In 2020, Bamford said he planned to build 3,000 buses of this type by 2024.

===2020s===

Wrightbus has followed two strategies towards achieving zero emission: creating battery-powered and fuel cell (powered by hydrogen) vehicles. Early orders following the introduction of Wright&#x27;s Electroliner and Hydroliner range included the Go-Ahead Group, who placed orders for fuel cell buses for its Metrobus fleet on the Fastway bus rapid transit service, and Translink of Northern Ireland, who placed an initial order for 38 battery electric buses.

Wrightbus announced in February 2023 that it was planning to build a green hydrogen production facility on its Ballymena site in partnership with Hygen Energy, capable of producing enough hydrogen to fuel up to 300 buses per day with the option to triple its production in line with future demand for the fuel. Funding for the construction of electrolysers at the facility was secured from the first round of the UK government&#x27;s £37.9 million UK Net Zero Hydrogen Fund in March 2023. Wrightbus was later granted up to £534,000 million in funding from the UK government-sponsored Advanced Propulsion Centre fund in September 2023 to develop a driveline based on the GB Kite Hydroliner for a hydrogen fuel cell-powered coach, which will be intended as a functional &quot;technology demonstrator&quot;. A driveline demonstrator capable of a range of was unveiled in September 2024 at the Cenex net-zero mobility show in Bedfordshire, with development work on the coach set to complete by 2025 before it takes to the road during 2026.

In June 2024, Wrightbus announced it had formed NewPower, a new subsidiary headquartered at the former Arrival Bus factory in Bicester, Oxfordshire, aimed at facilitating battery electric repowering of existing diesel Wrightbus buses, such as the StreetDeck, Gemini 2 and New Routemaster. At a cost of over £200,000, the repowering process involves the removal of the diesel drivetrain and ensuing fitment of a Voith Electric Drive System coupled with NMC battery packs and a Grayson HVAC system, all capable of being performed over a period of three weeks at a factory capacity of six buses being converted at one time. Wrightbus also announced it had opened a bus refurbishment business a short distance from the NewPower facility, which is aimed to complete external and internal refurbishments of buses following their battery electric conversions.

====Rightech====
On 29 January 2025, Wrightbus launched its &#x27;Rightech&#x27; sub-brand with the announcement of the Rightech RB6 and RB9 single-deck battery electric buses, produced in collaboration with Chinese bus and coach manufacturer King Long, and entered into truck manufacturing with the additional announcement of the Rightech RT75, a battery electric box truck produced in collaboration with JAC Motors and able to be specified at either a or wheelbase. Each model is available in both left- and right-hand drive variants for the UK and European bus and truck markets.

==Exports==
In 1997, an order for 25 Wright Crusader-bodied Dennis Darts was delivered to Australian operator ACTION. Between 2003 and 2006, Hong Kong operator Kowloon Motor Bus received a total of 164 Wrightbus three-axle double-deckers; 100 of them were on Volvo Super Olympian and 64 of them were on Volvo B9TL chassis. In 2009, Kowloon Motor Bus had ordered a total of 291 buses, including one demonstrator with two-axle, and all buses were in service in 2012. In 2010, the first of 450 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2-bodied Volvo B9TLs was delivered to SBS Transit, Singapore till end 2012.

In 2011, Wrightbus International was established. A contract was awarded by SBS Transit for 565 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodied Volvo B9TLs and delivered since January 2013 till June 2015. In November 2012, a contract for 50 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodied Volvos was awarded by Kowloon Motor Bus. These were sent in knock-down kit (CKD) form from Northern Ireland and assembled in China and followed by another 85, including two 12.8-metre-long demonstrators. In September 2013, Wrightbus entered into a partnership with Daimler Buses to manufacture buses in Chennai, India.

In March 2014, orders were secured from Hong Kong operators Citybus and New World First Bus for 51 bodies on Volvo B9TL chassis. These were sent in CKD form from Northern Ireland and assembled in Malaysia. In July 2014, SBS Transit ordered a further 415 Eclipse Gemini 2-bodied Volvo B9TLs which will be delivered from August 2015 till 2017, increasing the total to 1,430 by 2017. A single Eclipse Gemini 3-bodied Volvo B8L prototype was exported to Singapore for trial with SBS Transit but was subsequently sold to A&amp;S Transit, a private bus operator in Singapore.

<text>Torbernite, also known as chalcolite, is a relatively common mineral with the chemical formula Cu[(UO2)(PO4)]2(H2O)12. It is a radioactive, hydrated green copper uranyl phosphate, found in granites and other uranium-bearing deposits as a secondary mineral. 
The chemical formula of torbernite is similar to that of autunite in which a Cu2+ cation replaces a Ca2+ cation. Torbernite tends to dehydrate to metatorbernite with the sum formula Cu[(UO2)(PO4)]2(H2O)8.

== Etymology and history ==

Torbernite was found for the first time at Georg Wagsfort Mine near Johanngeorgenstadt in the Erzgebirge Mountains in Saxony. It was first mentioned in 1772 by Ignaz von Born in his work &quot;Lythophylacium Bornianum&quot;, calling it &quot;mica viridis crystallina, ibid.&quot; (green crystalline mica from Johanngeorgenstadt, Sax.; &quot;ibid.&quot; = &quot;as the item above&quot;). In 1780 Abraham Gottlob Werner uses Born&#x27;s work and describes the mineral in more detail, calling it at first &quot;grüner Glimmer&quot; (green mica), later naming it &quot;torbernite&quot; in honour of the Swedish mineralogist and chemist Torbern Olof Bergman (1735–1784).

== Classification ==
According to the International Mineralogical Association (IMA), which last updated its list in 2009, the Nickel-Strunz system lists torbernite in the section of &quot;uranyl phosphates and arsenates&quot;. There it is part of the sub-section &quot;UO2 : RO4 = 1 : 1&quot;, forming the autunite group along with autunite, heinrichite, kahlerite, kirchheimerite, metarauchite, nováčekite-I, nováčekite-II, saléeite, uranocircite I, uranocircite II, uranospinite, xiangjiangite and zeunerite with system number &quot;8.EB.05&quot;.

Dana groups the mineral into the class &quot;phosphates, arsenates and vanadates&quot;, into the section &quot;hydrated phosphates etc.&quot; into an unnamed group with metatorbernite, number 40.02a.13.

== Crystal structure ==
Torbernite crystallises in the tetragonal space group &quot;I&quot;4/&quot;mmm&quot; with the lattice parameters &quot;a&quot; = 7.0267(4) Å und &quot;c&quot; = 20.807(2) Å and 2 formula units per unit cell.

In a study in 2003, using fresh, synthetic crystals, Locock and Burns have compared the crystal structures of the copper uranyl phosphates torbernite, Cu[(UO2)(PO4)]2(H2O)12 and metatorbernite, Cu[(UO2)(PO4)]2(H2O)8 with those of the copper uranyl arsenates zeunerite, Cu[(UO2)(AsO4)]2(H2O)12, and metazeunerite, Cu[(UO2)(AsO4)]2(H2O)8. In these studies they were able to finally analyse the crystal structure of torbernite for the very first time, and to get a significantly more precise analysis for the structure of metatorbernite, compared with previous studies (Makarov and Tobelko &quot;R&quot;1 = 25%, Ross et al. &quot;R&quot;1 = 9.7%, Stergiou et al. &quot;R&quot;1 = 5.6%, Calos and Kennard &quot;R&quot;1 = 9.2% vs. Locock und Burns &quot;R&quot;1 = 2.3%).

The study shows that torbernite is isostructural to zeunerite, and metatorbernite is isostructural to metazeunerite. All four compounds are of the layered autunite type with the [(UO2)(XO4)]− structural motif (with X = P or As). The Cu2+ ions are coordinated in a square-planar fashion by water molecules in all these compounds, and further coordinate to the uranyl oxygen atoms, forming octahedra with Jahn-Teller distortion. The additional water molecules are held in the crystal structure only by hydrogen bridges.

== Metatorbernite ==

Torbernite dehydrates readily to metatorbernite with the sum formula Cu[(UO2)(PO4)]2(H2O)8. It forms as torbernite withers, and can also be obtained by artificially heating torbernite above 75 °C. The crystals are rather opaque and only weakly translucent with a glassy lustre.

Metatorbernite crystallises tetragonally-dipyramidally in space group &quot;P&quot;4/&quot;n&quot; with the lattice parameters &quot;a&quot; = 6.9756(5) Å and &quot;c&quot; = 17.349(2) Å and 2 formula units per unit cell.

The crystal structure of metatorbernite is different from torbernite as every second uranyl phosphate layer is moved about one half of the length of the crystallographic &quot;a&quot;-axis in the directions [100] and [010]. The analysis by Locock and Burns confirms the finding by Stergiou et al., that the Cu2+ ions only have an 88% crystallographic occupancy. The authors assume that by protonation of some of the water molecules there is a charge compensation for electronic neutrality, as it is discussed with the mineral chernikovite. The same is postulated by the same authors for autunite. Due to the limitations of X-ray diffraction this postulate is practically not verifiable with this method.

The analysis by Locock and Burns shows eight molecules of water per formula unit in metatorbernite. This is in accord with the works by Arthur Francis Hallimons and Kurt Walenta, who show that the different steps of hydration between torbernite and metatorbernite have clear boundaries, and the water content of each compound remains constant and does not vary, in contrast for instance, as seen in minerals of the zeolite group. Therefore, sum formulae indicating varying degrees of water for torbernite and metatorbernite must not be used.

== Properties ==

=== Morphology ===
The mineral is often encountered as small thin tabular crystals, but may also be flaky or powdery. More rare are thicker plates, resembling a stacked deck of cards. More frequent than these are dipyramidal forms.

=== Physical and chemical properties ===
Because of its uranium content of about 48% the material is strongly radioactive. According to the sum formula a specific activity of 85.9 kBq/g can be given (for comparison: natural potassium: 0.0312 kBq/g).

Contrary to its calcium analogue autunite the mineral does not fluoresce. 
The mineral is very brittle. Its hardness (Mohs) is between 2 and 2.5.

== Occurrence and localities ==

Torbernite forms as a secondary mineral on the oxidation zone of uranium ores. It is often found in paragenesis with autunite, metatorbernite, uraninite, zeunerite and, very rarely, with gauthierite.

Torbernite is relatively common, and world-wide there are more than 1100 documented localities known by 2022. In Germany it is known not only from its type locality Johanngeorgenstadt, but also from other areas in the Ore Mountains, as well as from the Black Forest, Fichtel Mountains, Bavarian Forest, Thuringian Forest. Further localities are in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, France, Gabon, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

== Precautions ==

Because of the inherent toxicity of uranium compounds, samples of this mineral should be kept in air tight glass jars.

<text>Transdev Blazefield is a bus group, which operates local and regional bus services across Greater Manchester, Lancashire, North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, England. Formed in August 1991, the group has been a subsidiary of French-based operator Transdev since January 2006.

==History==
Blazefield Travel was formed in August 1991, following the sale of AJS Group, owned by former East Yorkshire Motor Services managing director, Alan Stephenson. The company was sold in a management buyout to former directors, Giles Fearnley and Stuart Wilde – a deal valued at £2.2 million. The sale included seven of the company&#x27;s eight remaining bus firms at the time, as well as 300 vehicles and 12 depots. Initially, there were seven operating subsidiaries: Keighley &amp; District, Harrogate &amp; District, Harrogate Independent Travel, Sovereign Bus &amp; Coach, Sovereign Harrow and Welwyn Hatfield Line.

In September 1987, AJS Group purchased West Yorkshire Road Car Company from the National Bus Company. In April 1988, London Country North East was sold by the National Bus Company, the last of 72 subsidiaries to be privatised. Prior to the sale, the company was split in two, with County Bus &amp; Coach and Sovereign Bus &amp; Coach.

In August 1989, operations in Bradford and Leeds were transferred to Yorkshire Rider. The remaining operations were subsequently split into smaller companies: Keighley &amp; District, Harrogate &amp; District and York City &amp; District. In July 1990, operation of local bus services in York were also transferred to Yorkshire Rider.

Cambridge Coach Services was an operator of coach services, day tours, short breaks and charters. The company began operations on 20 May 1990, following the sale of Premier Travel Services to Cambus Holdings. Cambridge Coach Services was operated by Blazefield Holdings between August and November 1991.

Following sale to the Blazefield Group, expansion soon followed, with the purchase of Cambridge Coach Services in November 1991, along with 14 vehicles and Lucketts of Watford trading as Luckybus (not to be confused with Lucketts Travel on the South Coast). Ingfield of Settle was purchased in April 1992, and was merged with Keighley-based Northern Rose to form Ingfield–Northern Rose.

In 1986, Harrogate Independent Travel was set up by a number of West Yorkshire Road Car Company drivers, in a bid to challenge their former employer. The company was subsequently purchased by AJS Group in April 1989, before being merged with Harrogate &amp; District in 1993. Harrogate &amp; District further expanded in October 1996, following the transfer of bus operations in Ripon from Cowie Group.

In 1994, Blazefield purchased Borehamwood Travel Services, along with 43 vehicles – 22 of which were AEC Routemasters. The company was later renamed London Sovereign. In the same year, Ingfield–Northern Rose purchased Whaites Coaches of Settle. By this time, the group owned around 380 vehicles.

In 1998, Huntingdon &amp; District was created with the operations of Premier Buses, owned by Julian Peddle. It was sold to Cavalier of Sutton Bridge in 2004.

In April 2001, Stagecoach sold their operations in Blackburn, Bolton and Clitheroe to the Blazefield Group, which rebranded them as Burnley &amp; Pendle and Lancashire United. The sale was valued at £13 million. In August 2002, the depot in Bolton was sold to Blue Bus and Coach Services.

Over the next three years, Blazefield gradually withdrew from its operations in the south of England. In 2002, London Sovereign was sold to Transdev S.A., with Huntingdon &amp; District sold to Cavalier Travel the following year. In 2004, operations in St Albans were sold to Centrebus. In early 2005, the Competition Commission cleared Blazefield&#x27;s deal to sell what was left of London Sovereign to Arriva Shires &amp; Essex.

In January 2006, French-based operator Transdev acquired the Blazefield Group, along with 305 vehicles.

In August 2006, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council announced that after 125 years of municipal ownership, Blackburn Transport had been sold to Transdev Blazefield. The sale was finalised in January 2007. Eight months later, Accrington Transport and Northern Blue were acquired, along with the transfer of staff and 65 vehicles.

In August 2008, Top Line Travel and Veolia Transport were purchased. The company further expanded in February 2012, following the purchase of York Pullman&#x27;s local bus operations. The sale included the transfer of 31 staff and 17 vehicles.

Following the granting of approval on 20 December 2017, Rossendale Transport Limited was sold by Rossendale Borough Council on 12 January 2018. The sale saw the company&#x27;s 240 staff and 102 vehicles join Transdev Blazefield – a move which saw the investment of £3 million in a new fleet of high-specification vehicles for routes in and around Bury, Rochdale and Rossendale.

In August 2020, Transdev took over operation of Leeds Bradford Airport&#x27;s bus route network from previous operator Yorkshire Tiger, branding the network as Flyer, alongside acquiring their depot in Idle.

In April 2021, Transdev agreed terms with Arriva to purchase the Yorkshire Tiger operation in West Yorkshire. The sale was completed in July 2021, following which the operation was rebranded Team Pennine, with a two-tone pink livery introduced.

==Fleet and operations==
As of October 2024, Transdev Blazefield has eight operating subsidiaries:

* The Blackburn Bus Company
* The Burnley Bus Company
* Flyer
* The Harrogate Bus Company
* The Keighley Bus Company
* Rosso
* Team Pennine
* Yorkshire Coastliner
The company also operates key routes such as:

* The 36 
* Red Express (X41) 
* The Witch Way (X43) 
* Coastliner (840 and 843) 
The company operates a total of 515 vehicles from ten depots across Yorkshire and the North West of England. The frontline fleet includes buses manufactured by Alexander Dennis (Enviro200, Enviro200 MMC and Enviro400 MMC), Mellor (Strata), Mercedes-Benz (eCitaro), Optare (Solo SR, Tempo and Versa), Plaxton (President), Volvo (7900e) and Wrightbus (Eclipse Gemini, Eclipse Urban).

<doc id="1086109" wikidata="Q6610183" url="?curid=1086109" title="List of closed railway stations in Sydney">
<text>The city of Sydney has been served by an extensive network of railway lines since the Main Suburban railway line opened in 1855, with over 70 railway stations in Sydney having been subsequently closed. Many of the stations closed as a result of the closure of the railway lines which they were located on.

==Closed lines==
There are several closed lines in Sydney. Dates refer to each railway line&#x27;s opening and closure dates and are not necessarily reflective of passenger service dates.
* The Abattoirs railway line (1911-1996), from Lidcombe to Abattoirs.
* The Camden railway line (1882-1963), from Campbelltown to Camden.
* The Holsworthy railway line (1918-1977), from Liverpool to Holsworthy.
* The Kurrajong railway line (1926-1952), from Richmond to Kurrajong.
* The Potts Hill railway line (1912-1966), from Regents Park to Potts Hill.
* The Prospect Quarry railway line (1902-1926), from Toongabbie to Prospect.
* The Rogans Hill railway line (1923-1932), from Westmead to Rogans Hill.
* The Rookwood Cemetery railway line (1864-1948), serving Rookwood Cemetery.
* The Ropes Creek railway line (1942-1986), from St Marys to Ropes Creek.
* The Warwick Farm Racecourse railway line (1889-1991), from Glenfield to Warwick Farm Racecourse.
* The Woronora Cemetery railway line (1900-1947), from Sutherland to Woronora Cemetery.

==Converted lines==
There are several railway lines that have been either fully or partially converted for other purposes. The dates refer to each railway line&#x27;s existence as part of the wider Sydney Trains and freight railway network.

Fully converted lines
* The Epping to Chatswood railway line (2009-2018), converted to form part of the Sydney Metro Northwest line.
* The Rozelle–Darling Harbour Goods railway line (1855-1996), converted to form part of the Inner West Light Rail.
* The Royal National Park railway line (1886-1991), converted to a heritage tramway for the Sydney Tramway Museum.

Partially converted lines
* The Bankstown railway line (1895-2024), converted to form part of the Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest line.
* The Carlingford railway line (1885-2020), converted to form part of the Parramatta Light Rail.
* The Sandown railway line (1888-2019), converted to form part of the Parramatta Light Rail.

== Stations ==
&#x27;Suburb&#x27; refers to the location of the station itself and may not correlate with the suburb served, such as which was located in Elderslie but served the suburb of Kirkham.&lt;br&gt; Stations that were closed and later rebuilt or reopened have been noted through multiple dates.&lt;br&gt; &#x27;Replacement&#x27; refers to stations that were opened either directly after the former station&#x27;s closure, or built later at the same location.&lt;br&gt; For ease of access, linkage to railway lines and suburbs are repeated throughout the table.

in after a station name means &quot;industrial station&quot;: stations built especially for workers. Many of these lines and stations also served non-worker passengers, such as the Sandown line.&lt;br&gt;
* after a station name means &quot;renamed before closure&quot;, with some renamed several times. Stations are referred to by their final name before closure.&lt;br&gt;► after a replacement station means &quot;later renamed as&quot;.&lt;br&gt; after a replacement name indicates a Sydney Trains station.&lt;br&gt; after a replacement name indicates a Sydney Metro station.&lt;br&gt; after a replacement name indicates a Sydney Light Rail stop.&lt;br&gt; +/- after a replacement station&#x27;s name indicates that it lies close to the disused station but is slightly displaced (and may not run along the same line).

The following railway stations in Sydney have been closed:

<text>Prince Far I (23 March 1945 – 15 September 1983) was a Jamaican reggae deejay and producer, and a Rastafarian. He was known for his gruff voice and critical assessment of the Jamaican government. His track &quot;Heavy Manners&quot; used lyrics about government measures initiated at the time against violent crime.

==Biography==
He was born Michael James Williams in Spanish Town, Jamaica. Williams&#x27; first job in the music industry was as a deejay on the Sir Mike the Musical Dragon sound system, also working as a security guard at Joe Gibbs&#x27; studio, and later as a bouncer at Studio One, but after recording &quot;The Great Booga Wooga&quot; for Bunny Lee in 1969 (under the name King Cry Cry, a reference to his habit of breaking into tears when angered), he got the chance in 1970 to record for Coxsone Dodd when King Stitt failed to turn up for a session. Dodd was sufficiently impressed to release the resulting recordings, Williams now using the name Prince Far I at the suggestion of another producer he had worked with, Enos McLeod. With a unique deep bass voice and talking over style, preferring to describe himself as a &quot;chanter&quot; rather than a &quot;toaster&quot;, he became a popular reggae musician, styling himself &quot;The Voice of Thunder&quot;.

His first album, &quot;Psalms For I&quot;, featuring the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and various psalms, was dedicated to the illiterate who could not read the Bible for themselves. He then worked with Joe Gibbs on the second album, &quot;Under Heavy Manners&quot;, before being signed by Virgin Records for their &quot;Frontline&quot; label. Twelve albums followed between 1978 and 1981, including the highly regarded &quot;Cry Tuff Dub Encounter&quot; series of dub albums, produced by Williams and released on his Cry Tuff label, and featuring the Roots Radics under the pseudonym The Arabs. Spending an increasing amount of time in England, he also collaborated with UK On-U Sound Records including providing vocals in the reggae collective Singers &amp; Players and may be considered a mentor figure to Adrian Sherwood. His final live performance took place on 7 December 1982 at Band on the Wall, Manchester, where he performed with Suns of Arqa This performance is captured on his album &quot;Musical Revue&quot;. In 1983, he provided vocals on Suns of Arqa&#x27;s second LP Wadada Magic, and many of these vocals have been reused by the band repeatedly on a variety of tracks and remixes, ranging from their first album in 1980 to (so far) 2006. He is credited for vocals on the sleeve of each of the releases in question.

Later that year he recorded the album &quot;Umkhonto We Sizwe&quot; with producer Roy Cousins in Kingston. Before the album was finished he was shot at his home in Kingston, Jamaica, during a robbery, allegedly relating to a dispute over money, and died later in hospital.

Adrian Sherwood, deeply upset by the murder of his friend, took a production hiatus from his beloved reggae genre and in 1983 recorded with his group Circut and Neneh Cherry, &quot;Dead Come Alive&quot;. Prince Far I is also referred to by The Clash in their single &quot;Clash City Rockers&quot; and also by The Mountain Goats in the song &quot;Sept. 15th 1983&quot;, a reference to the date of his death.

<text>Mahdia ( &quot;&quot;) is a Tunisian coastal city with 76,513 inhabitants, south of Monastir and southeast of Sousse.

Mahdia is a provincial centre north of Sfax. It is important for the associated fish-processing industry, as well as weaving. It is the capital of Mahdia Governorate.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
The old part of Mahdia corresponds to the Roman city called Aphrodisium and, later, called Africa (a name perhaps derived from the older name), or Cape Africa. The Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees includes a no longer residential bishopric called Africa and, since there is no record of an episcopal see in Roman times called by either of these names (nor by that of Alipota, another Roman town that Charles Tissot suggested tentatively might be represented by present-day Mehdia), it is supposed that the episcopal see of Africa was established when the city was held by the Kingdom of Sicily, as a part of the Kingdom of Africa (1147–1160) and when Pope Eugene III consecrated a bishop for it in 1148. An inventory of movable property of the church of Africa (&quot;inventarium thesauri Africani&quot;) exists in an archive of the Cappella Palatina of Palermo in Sicily. Salim Dev identified Mahdia instead with ancient &quot;Ruspae&quot; or &quot;Ruspe&quot;, which is more commonly taken to have been at Henchir Sbia (or just Sbia), north of Mahdia, or at the ruins known as Ksour Siad. The most illustrious bishop of this see was Fulgentius of Ruspe. The Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees, which identifies the see of Africa as Mahdia, identifies Ruspe/Ruspae as Henchir Sbia.

The Mahdia shipwreck – a sunken ship found off Mahdia&#x27;s shore, containing Greek art treasures – is dated to about 80 BC, the early part of Roman rule in this region.

=== Islamic era ===
Muslim Mahdia was founded by the Fatimids under the Caliph Abdallah al-Mahdi and made the capital of Ifriqiya. As the then-newly-created Fatimid Caliphate was a Shi&#x27;a regime supported by a Berber Kutama military, the caliph may have been motivated to move his capital here so as to put some distance between his power base and the predominantly Sunni city of Kairouan (the traditional capital of Ifriqiya up to that point). Construction began in 916 and the new city was officially inaugurated on 20 February 921, although some construction continued afterward. In addition to its heavy fortified walls, the city included the Fatimid palaces, an artificial harbor, and a congregational mosque (the Great Mosque of Mahdia). Most of the Fatimid city has not survived to the present day. The mosque, however, is one of the most well-preserved Fatimid monuments in the Maghreb, although it has been extensively damaged over time and was in large part reconstructed by archeologists in the 1960s. Fragments of mosaic pavements from the palaces have also been discovered from modern excavations. 

In 1087, the town was attacked by raiding ships from Genoa and Pisa who burned the Muslim fleet in the harbor. The attack played a critical role in Christians&#x27; seizure of control of the Western Mediterranean, which allowed the First Crusade to be supplied by sea. The Zirid dynasty, which succeeded the Fatimids in the Maghreb, moved their capital here in 1057. Their rule was brought to an end by the Norman conquest of the city in 1148. In 1160 the city came under Almohad rule.

The role of the capital was taken over by Tunis in the 12th century during the Almohad era, which it remained during the Hafsid Dynasty. Later the city was subject to many raids. In 1390 it was the target of the Barbary Crusade, when a French army laid siege to the city but failed to take it.

The city was captured by the Spaniards in 1550. A Spanish garrison remained there until 1553. Charles V then offered the charge of the town to the Order of Saint John who ruled Malta but they refused it deeming it too expensive. The emperor ordered the Viceroy of Sicily, Juan de Vega, to dismantle Mahdia despite it being a strategically important stronghold. The demolition tasks were carried out by Hernando de Acuña. Shortly after Mahdia was reoccupied by the Ottomans, but only to live by fishing and oil-works, and the town lost its logistic and commercial importance. It remained under Turkish rule until the 19th century.

During the Nazi Occupation of Tunisia in World War II, Mahdia was the site where Khaled Abdelwahhab hid approximately two dozen persecuted Jews.

<text>James Christopher Adkins (born November 10, 1975) is an American musician who is best known as the lead guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter of the rock band Jimmy Eat World.

== Career ==

=== Jimmy Eat World (1993–present) ===

Adkins grew up in Mesa, Arizona, and had been playing guitar since the age of two. He has cited Def Leppard&#x27;s song &quot;Photograph&quot; as an early influence that sparked his desire to become a guitarist, and had also learned songs by hair metal bands such as Mötley Crüe. Although he had an early preference for virtuosic guitar players, he broadened his horizons after being introduced to Fugazi by a cousin in Nebraska, where his family comes from. Adkins has also stated that Drive Like Jehu is his favorite guitar-based band, and his love of the band inspired him to seek out drummer Mark Trombino to produce 1996&#x27;s &quot;Static Prevails&quot;. To date, Trombino has produced four of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s records.

While attending Mountain View High School, Adkins formed a band named Sonic Pudding which later changed its name, first to I Ate The Sandbox and then to Schon Theory. This band&#x27;s style leaned towards West Coast alternative rock bands such as Drive Like Jehu and Rocket from the Crypt. Adkins co-formed Jimmy Eat World in 1993 after being invited by drummer Zach Lind, who Adkins had known since preschool, to form a band with him. Around this time, Adkins teamed up with Joel Leibow to help promote Mesa as a touring spot for musicians in order to build up a local scene. The band released their self-titled debut in 1994, with Adkins primarily on guitar and contributing lead vocals on only a single track, with his other vocal work being backing vocals. Adkins later attended Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff for a time until he was pursued by an agent from Capitol Records. Their second album &quot;Static Prevails&quot; saw guitarist Tom Linton and Adkins trading spots as the lead vocalist from track to track, and their album &quot;Clarity&quot; saw Adkins taking over lead vocals for all but one of the tracks.

As a result of the runaway critical success of &quot;Clarity&quot; and the things that surrounded it, Adkins was quoted a few months after its release as saying he had &quot;grown up a little bit,&quot; and also said of himself that &quot;I didn&#x27;t know quite as much as I thought I did when I was 18.&quot; Reflecting on the critical and commercial success of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Bleed American&quot; almost two decades after its release, Adkins claimed that his songwriting in the early days of Jimmy Eat World was &quot;100 percent&quot; unconscious (that is, spontaneous), but that over time he developed a conscious need to make sure each of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s records stand up on their own by having a reason for their creation.

Around 2013, Adkins had become sober and has credited his sobriety with enhancing his enjoyment of songwriting.

=== Solo work (2015–present) ===
In 2015, Adkins announced he would be doing his first solo tour following the release of his debut solo EP &quot;I Will Go&quot; that same year. In 2020, Adkins started a podcast named &quot;Pass-Through Frequencies&quot; wherein he interviews other musicians.

== Personal life ==
Adkins has three children with his ex-wife Amy. He resides in Phoenix, Arizona.

<doc id="1086133" wikidata="Q206206" url="?curid=1086133" title="Human Rights Day">
<text>Human Rights Day (HRD) is celebrated annually around the world on 10 December every year.

The date was chosen to honor the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s adoption and proclamation, on 10 December 1948, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the first global enunciation of human rights and one of the first major achievements of the new United Nations. The formal establishment of Human Rights Day occurred at the 317th Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on 4 December 1950, when the General Assembly declared resolution 423(V), inviting all member states and any other interested organizations to celebrate the day as they saw fit.

The day is normally marked both by high-level political conferences and meetings and by cultural events and exhibitions dealing with human rights issues. Besides, it is traditionally on 10 December that the five-yearly United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights and Nobel Peace Prize are awarded. Many governmental and non-governmental organizations active in the human rights field also schedule special events to commemorate the day, as do many civil and social-cause organisations.

==History==

Human Rights Day is the day in 1948 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The formal inception of Human Rights Day dates from 1950, after the Assembly passed resolution 423(V) inviting all States and interested organisations to adopt 10 December of each year as Human Rights Day. The popularity of the day can be shown by the fact that the commemorative Human Rights Day stamp issued by the United Nations Postal Administration in 1952, received approximately 200,000 advance orders.

When the General Assembly adopted the Declaration, with 48 states in favor and eight abstentions, it was proclaimed as a &quot;common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations&quot;, towards which individuals and societies should &quot;strive by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance&quot;. The measure was received by both advocates and critics alike as &quot;being more declarative than legislative, more suggestive than binding.&quot;

Although the Declaration with its broad range of political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights is not a binding document, it inspired more than 60 human rights instruments which together constitute an international standard of human rights. Today the general consent of all United Nations Member States on the basic Human Rights laid down in the Declaration makes it even stronger and emphasizes the relevance of Human Rights in our daily lives.

The High Commissioner for Human Rights, as the main United Nations rights official and his Office plays a major role in coordinating efforts for the yearly observation of Human Rights Day:

The 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights occurred on 10 December 2008, and the UN Secretary-General launched a year-long campaign leading up to this anniversary. Because the UDHR holds the world record as the most translated document (except for the Bible), organizations around the globe used the year to focus on helping people everywhere learn about their rights.

On 9 December 2001, President George W. Bush made a Presidential proclamation that Human Rights Week began on 9 December. He also made the same proclamation on 10 December 2008.

==Past observances==

==Date variance==
In South Africa, Human Rights Day is celebrated on 21 March, in remembrance of the Sharpeville massacre which took place on 21 March 1960. This massacre occurred as a result of protests against the Apartheid regime in South Africa. South African Human Rights Day was declared a national holiday when the ANC was elected as the government with Nelson Mandela as the first democratically elected leader. Parliament&#x27;s role on this day is to empower the people so that the democratic processes becomes known to all South Africans.

It is celebrated on 11 December in Kiribati.

<doc id="1086142" wikidata="Q2344355" url="?curid=1086142" title="Keymaker">
<text>The Keymaker is a fictional character, portrayed by Korean-American actor Randall Duk Kim, in the 2003 film &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. He is a computer program that can create shortcut commands, physically represented as keys, which can be used by other programs to gain quick access to various areas within the simulated reality of the Matrix. He appears as an elderly, bespectacled Korean man dressed in a button-down shirt, smock, and an apron hung with bunches of keys.

==Backstory and role==
The Keymaker is an &quot;Exile&quot;, a program whose usefulness has come to an end and that has chosen to hide in the Matrix rather than be deleted. The Oracle tells Neo that he will need the Keymaker&#x27;s help in order to reach the Source, the machine mainframe; however, he is being held captive by a dangerous Exile known as the Merovingian. Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity are rebuffed when they demand that the Merovingian release the Keymaker, but his wife Persephone betrays him and takes them to where the Keymaker is being held: a small room in which he toils over a key-cutting machine. Thousands of previously made keys hang in bunches on the walls.

Morpheus and Trinity, separated from Neo, flee with the Keymaker as the Merovingian&#x27;s Twins, the police, and three Agents (sent to terminate the Keymaker as he is an Exile) pursue them onto the city freeways. The Keymaker assists in the escape by quickly providing Trinity with the ignition key needed to start a motorcycle, saving her the time of waiting for hot-wiring instructions to be uploaded into her mind.

Following the escape, the Keymaker meets with three crews of Zion rebels to describe the security measures in place around the building which houses the door that leads to the Source. Two electric power stations must both be shut down in order to disable the alarm system, after which Neo will have only a short time to reach the Source before the building is destroyed by explosives; in addition, if the door is opened while the alarm is still active or if anyone other than Neo tries to open it, the explosives will detonate. As the other two crews attack the power stations, the Keymaker leads Neo and Morpheus to a hall within the building, filled with doors that represent backdoor access to other parts of the Matrix.

They are interrupted by the arrival of Agent Smith and dozens of copies he has made of himself. The Keymaker hurriedly opens a door, allowing Neo and Morpheus to take cover inside a room as the Smiths open fire, but sustains multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. Before dying, he gives Neo a single key on a chain around his neck—the one needed to reach the Source—and points Morpheus toward a door that will allow him to re-enter the Matrix proper.

==Role experience==
Casting director Mali Finn succeeded in bringing Kim to the attention of the Wachowskis, the creators of the &quot;Matrix&quot; series. &quot;Randall Duk Kim was cast for his talent, his presence and his voice,&quot; said Finn. After meeting the Wachowskis, Kim said he agreed to the Keymaker role &quot;without a single bit of hesitation.&quot; Kim described the Keymaker as a character that belongs in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; but then somehow ended up in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and then got lost in the Matrix. The Wachowskis&#x27; thoughts on Keymaker were coming on the spot as various takes were done. He is a creation of collaboration; for example, Lana Wachowski suggested that Kim cut his stride in half, so that the Keymaker&#x27;s movements appeared as more of a scurry, than a normal gait.

In an interview with Tim Lammers to promote the DVD release of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, Kim said, &quot;I&#x27;m so happy to be part of such a wonderful tale as this. I was a fan before I even got the audition call for &quot;Reloaded&quot;&quot;. &quot;When I got the part, you could hardly keep me from flying off the ground,&quot; Kim gleefully recalled. Despite the elaborate set-up and tireless hours, Kim said he could not get enough of the &quot;Matrix&quot; experience. &quot;On every single day of that shoot I felt like a little kid on big adventure,&quot; Kim enthused. &quot;And working for [the Wachowskkis], they&#x27;re childlike in their creativity—it&#x27;s just contagious&quot;. Kim said further that the stunt drivers in the freeway motorcycle chase scene were some of the most amazing people he had ever met. &quot;That was real. I would say Carrie and I did about three-quarters of what&#x27;s seen up there,&quot; he revealed. Kim was backed by professional motocross racer David Barrett in a jump that was a double on the Ducati motorcycle used in the freeway chase. In a June 2001 interview, stunt player Debbie Evans said it was &quot;pretty ambitious, because those bikes aren&#x27;t made to do that sort of thing, but we pulled it off&quot;.

The Keymaker also appears in the short lampoon &quot;MTV Movie Awards Reloaded&quot;, produced for the 2003 MTV Movie Awards.

<text>Oni () is a town in Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti region (&quot;mkhare&quot;), Georgia. Historically and ethnographically, it is part of Racha, a historic highland province in western Georgia. The town also serves as an administrative center of the Oni district (&quot;raioni&quot;).

Oni is situated in a deep gorge on the left bank of Rioni River, some above sea level and northwest of Georgia&#x27;s capital Tbilisi.

== History ==

The territory of modern-day Oni has been inhabited since the Bronze Age. Archaeology revealed the artifacts of Colchian culture, particularly a collection of Colchian coins dating back to the 6th–3rd centuries BC. Oni is first chronicled in the 15th century, though a legend has it that the town was founded by the 2nd BC king Pharnajom of Iberia. Located on the crossroads from Northern Caucasus, Kartli (central Georgia), Imereti (western Georgia) and Lower Rach’a, Oni developed into a typical late medieval commercial town and was contested between the kings of Imereti and the princes of Rach’a. The town was absorbed by Imperial Russia in 1810, and made it, in 1846 the administrative center of the Racha Uyezd of the Kutaisi Governorate. During the Soviet Union, the town was united with a number of surrounding villages into the Oni district, which is currently administered as a part of the Racha-Lechkhumi and Lower Svaneti region.

In recent decades Oni has suffered from earthquakes and a series of avalanches. A particularly severe earthquake occurred on 29 April 1991. The earthquake measured 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale with a maximum MSK intensity of IX (&quot;Destructive&quot;), the most powerful ever recorded in the Caucasus Mountains, and caused significant damage to the infrastructure of Oni.
Despite a post-Soviet tendency towards migration, Oni still retains a small number of Jewish families – remnants of once powerful and large historic Jewish community, Georgia&#x27;s third largest, after those of Tbilisi and Kutaisi. The Oni Synagogue was built in the 1880s by a Polish architect and the builders were Greek Jews from Thessaloniki.

Oni and its environs house a number of historical monuments, including the ruins of medieval forts and Georgian Orthodox churches. A popular spa, Shovi, and Utsera are located some from Oni, on the southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus mountains. The Racha Regional Museum, located in Oni, has an impressive collection of 14000 unique artifacts from the fields of archaeology, ethnography, numismatics, natural history, fine art, historical documents, manuscripts, and printed books.

==Demographic==
The vast majority of the population is of Georgian origin and are Christians Orthodox.
The largest ethnic minority is the Ossetian people.

There was a large community of Georgian Jews which explain the presence of the Oni Synagogue but they emigrated to Israel after the fall of USSR and only a few remain to look after synagogue.

<text>3/24 (, &quot;tres vint-i-quatre&quot;) is a Catalan free-to-air television channel owned and operated by Televisió de Catalunya (TVC). It&#x27;s the TVC&#x27;s all-news network, launched on 11 September 2003.

==History==

3/24 was launched on 11 September 2003 as an initiative of the Catalan public television to develop digital terrestrial television in Catalonia.

In April 2015, the channel stopped broadcasting in the Balearic Islands, along with channels El 33 and Super3 (which run under the same frequency) as a result of the reorganisation of the regional radio space, returning in December of that same year.

During the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020, the channel began sharing its broadcasts with TV3.

On 16 January 2024, 3/24 switched its 576i SD feed to 1080i HD, as did all the other TVC channels.

==Contents==
3/24 devotes exclusively to live news and information, including news, traffic (morning), sports and stock markets from Borsa de Barcelona. 

Most of the day, under the title &quot;Notícies 3/24&quot;, the channel features a 30-minute informational cycle. At night, it broadcasts &quot;Món 3/24&quot;, a world news and talk show programme. In addition, a special Aranese language news cycle is broadcast twice everyday under the name &quot;3/24 Aranés&quot; which, unlike the Aran version of &quot;Telenotícies comarques&quot;, is watchable from all broadcast territories with the aim of encouraging and aiding viewers learning the language.

3/24 also broadcasts sports-related programmes such as &quot;3/24 Esports&quot; also simulcasted by channel Esport3.

<doc id="1086161" wikidata="Q7501082" url="?curid=1086161" title="Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association">
<text>The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees&#x27; Association (SDA) is a private sector trade union in Australia, representing retail, fast-food and warehousing workers, and has branches in each state and territory. Its membership is predominantly in casual and insecure employment within retail and fast food establishments. The union also represents a significant membership of workers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.

The main categories of workers covered by the SDA are retail, fast food and warehousing workers but the SDA also covers reserve and backdock employees, pharmacies, footwear repairing, modelling, and hairdressing/beauty. The SDA has overlapping with other trade unions and their areas of coverage, such as the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union in the case of retail meat employees and the United Workers Union&#x27;s coverage of warehousing employees and bakers employees.

The SDA has branches across Australia. There is the Victorian Branch; New South Wales &amp; ACT Branch; Newcastle &amp; Northern Branch; Queensland Branch; South Australian/Northern Territory &amp; Broken Hill Branch; Western Australian Branch; and the Tasmanian Branch. The SDA is affiliated to several organisations, which include the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the global union federation, UNI Global Union. Through its affiliation to the ALP, the union has maintained strong political involvement.

==History==

=== Early history ===
During the 1890s and the early 1900s, the predecessors of the SDA first came into existence in most states, particularly through &#x27;Early Closing Associations&#x27; focused on restricting shop trading hours. These Associations had begun campaigning for a reduction in working hours from 14 to 12 hours a day as early as 1844.

In 1908, unions representing retail and warehousing workers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia combined to become the Shop Assistants and Warehouse Employees Federation of Australia. It was registered as a union under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904.

Over time, unions in Tasmania, Newcastle, Broken Hill and Western Australia became part of the national union. In 1972, the union changed its name to the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees&#x27; Association.

In the 1940s and 50s, the union was involved with the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s (ALP) Industrial Groups that were organised to counter communists in the unions. These unions de-affiliated themselves with the Victorian ALP during the ALP split of 1955. The SDA re-affiliated with the Australian Labor Party in the 1980s under Labor leader Bob Hawke and is currently a member of the Labor Right faction of the party.

=== Women ===
During the war years of the 1940s the retail industry changed from being a substantially male occupation to having large numbers of women. The SDA was instrumental in achieving equal pay for women in 1975, with women comprising more than 65% of the SDA&#x27;s membership as of 2010.

The union was heavily involved in achieving the 44-hour working week in 1945 and then the 38-hour week in 1984. Other achievements include winning redundancy pay in 1986, four weeks annual leave in 1974 and 12 months maternity leave in 1979.

In 1987, the SDA helped facilitate compulsory employer payments of 3% superannuation for employees paid into industry fund REST Super with joint union-employer directors.

=== Recent history ===
In 1991, the Australian Hairdressers, Wigmakers and Hairworkers Employees&#x27; Federation and the Mannequins&#x27; &amp; Models&#x27; Guild of Australia merged with the SDA.

The SDA has a history of campaigning across the broader union movement. It was the biggest financial contributor to unions in the 1998 Australian waterfront dispute and the &#x27;Your Rights At Work&#x27; campaign, which is credited with overturning John Howard&#x27;s WorkChoices laws. It continues this tradition today through its contribution to the ACTU&#x27;s &quot;Change The Rules&quot; campaign focused on reforming Australian industrial relations in the lead up to the 2019 federal election.

The SDA was led for 36 years from 1978 to 2014 by National Secretary Joe de Bruyn. De Bruyn was previously Senior Vice President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions ACTU and was President of global union federation UNI Global Union from 2010 to 2014. He did not stand for re-election in 2014 and former NSW Branch Secretary Gerard Dwyer was elected National Secretary by the SDA&#x27;s National Council. De Bruyn remained the SDA&#x27;s honorary National President until he was replaced by Victorian Branch Secretary Michael Donovan 2018.

In the 1980s, under the leadership of de Bruyn, the SDA strongly supported the Polish free trade union movement, Solidarity. The SDA brought Solidarity on tour to Australia to pressure the repressive, communist Polish Government as well as financially support charities that assisted Poland in its transition from communism.

In 2015, ABC&#x27;s Four Corners reported widespread wage theft and exploitation at 7-Eleven franchise stores. In response, the SDA established a hotline and dedicated team of industrial officers to help workers recover lost wages. The union has made numerous submissions calling for a reform of the Franchise Code of Conduct.

Following the 2017 launch of Amazon in Australia, the SDA and the Transport Workers Union formed the &quot;Online Retail &amp; Delivery Workers Alliance&quot;. The alliance is part of a global movement led by UNI Global Union and its affiliates to organise workers in Amazon fulfilment centres.

== Industrial activity ==

===Youth wages===

Australia operates a system of youth wages where it is legal for workers under the age of 21 to be paid a percentage of the adult wage rate for their job. The SDA has campaigned and called for the abolition of junior wages for decades.

In 2013 the SDA began a national campaign to end youth wages for workers aged 18 years of age and the retail industry. This commenced with a case at the Fair Work Commission to remove the ninety percent rate for 20-year-olds in the retail award. The Fair Work Commission ruled in favour of the SDA&#x27;s application in 2014 and the 20-year-old rate began to phase out in the retail award from 2015.

===Customer violence and abuse===

In 2017, the SDA launched a national public awareness campaign &quot;No One Deserves a Serve&quot; to combat what the union described as the growing problem of violence and abuse directed at retail workers by customers. A survey conducted by the union of 6,000 retail and fast food workers found that more than 85 per cent had experienced abuse from customers. Almost three-quarters (74 percent) of respondents were women, and 65 percent of respondents worked in front end services (like cashiers and registers) and just over half (51 percent) of respondents said that no action was taken after they reported an incident.

In 2018, the SDA launched its campaign &quot;Don&#x27;t Bag Retail Staff&quot; in response to the highly publicised ban of free single-use plastic bags introduced in some states.

===Public holidays===

The SDA has advocated for protecting and expanding public holiday rights and entitlements across all Australian states and territories.

South Australia &amp; Northern Territory

In South Australia, the SDA spearheaded the campaign to achieve part-day public holidays after 6pm on Christmas Eve and New Year&#x27;s Eve. In 2012, the South Australian government legislated these new part-day public holidays into law - making it a national first. The same was achieved in the Northern Territory in 2015.&lt;ref name= &quot;SDA SA/NT website&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

New South Wales &amp; Newcastle

The SDA NSW and Newcastle branches launched the &quot;Take The Time&quot; campaign to protect retail closures on key public holidays, such as Christmas Day and Boxing Day, Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Anzac Day.

In 2015, the NSW government introduced changes to the Retail Trading Act to allow for a trial of retail trading on Boxing Day. As part of the &quot;Take The Time&quot; campaign, the SDA strongly opposed moves to permanently allow stores to open on Boxing Day - or any remaining trading-free days.

Victoria

In 2015, the SDA successfully campaigned for the creation of an Easter Sunday public holiday. In the same year, the Friday before AFL grand final day was also gazetted as a newly created public holiday. Following efforts by the SDA, Victoria increased its number of public holidays to 13 days per year - the highest number in the nation.

Western Australia

In 2017, the SDA Western Australian branch launched a campaign to have Easter Saturday and Easter Sunday legislated as formal public holidays. The campaign was launched amid criticism that WA only had 10 official public holidays a year - the lowest of any state or territory.

Queensland

In 2017, the SDA Queensland branch successfully campaigned for and won Easter Sunday as a legislated public holiday. It was the first new public holiday achieved in Queensland since Anzac Day in 1927.

The Queensland branch continues to campaign for Christmas Eve and New Year&#x27;s Eve part-day public holidays.

===Industrial approach===
As a result of the SDA&#x27;s coverage, the union claims it is moderate and responsible in its approach to industrial relations. Academics Robin A. Price, Janis Bailey and Amanda Pyman have argued that though &quot;referred to pejoratively as a &#x27;business union&#x27;&quot;, the union &quot;has been remarkably successful as an organisation, as measured by a number of indicators, including growth and size, and pay increases relative to statutory minimum conditions&quot;. Research conducted by Ernst &amp; Young has found that Australia ranks second (with Denmark ranked first) out of 12 countries when comparing the average monthly retail industry wage on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis.

==Criticisms==
In &quot;Hart v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd and Bi-Lo Pty Ltd [2016] FWCFB 2887&quot; (31 May 2016), the Full Bench of the Fair Work Commission (FWC) refused to approve an enterprise agreement for Coles Supermarkets on the basis that it did not pass the &#x27;better off overall test&#x27; (BOOT). The FWC&#x27;s decision effectively overturned a practice used by many unions since the 1980s and endorsed by the ACTU in the &quot;Daimaru Case&quot; in 1992. Following this decision, some media outlets criticised the union for poor outcomes in its workplace negotiations due to the union bargaining for industry-wide conditions with a result of beneath-award pay outcomes for members, despite the newly applied test not taking into account above Award conditions including Annual Leave Loading. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; claimed that a quarter of a million workers across several major employers had been underpaid as a result of the union&#x27;s negotiations, labelling it a &quot;national wages scandal&quot;. Penalty rates, for working at night or on weekend, were scrapped in some agreements in return for higher base rates at all hours.

The union has also been criticised for its close relationship with employers, which &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; has labelled &quot;a longstanding and cosy partnership&quot;. One controversial aspect of this has been the widely used practice across many industries of paying an administration charge for payroll deduction of union dues from major companies. The union defended the arrangements, citing the importance of payroll deductions for members who work fluctuating hours.

==Political activity ==
The SDA is affiliated with the Australian Labor Party and is one of the most powerful unions in the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s Labor Right faction. The union has been a leading supporter of many significant Labor Party reforms including Medicare, Compulsory Superannuation and abolishing John Howard&#x27;s WorkChoices laws. The SDA&#x27;s Victorian branch was the largest individual donor to the Victorian Labor Party in 2013–14, giving $315,667.

SDA Secretary, Gerard Dwyer, is currently an elected member of the Australian Labor Party National Executive. Present federal members of Australia&#x27;s parliamentary Labor Party that have a close association with the SDA include House of Representatives members Tony Burke, Nick Champion and Amanda Rishworth and Senators Catryna Bilyk, Raff Ciccone, Don Farrell, Deborah O&#x27;Neill and Helen Polley. Historically, the SDA leadership has taken some socially conservative positions especially concerning issues like abortion, IVF, and same-sex marriage in Australia. In 2016, the SDA formally declared neutrality on the issue of same sex marriage with the National Executive of the SDA adopting a policy of supporting the right of members of the ALP to act according to their conscience on the matter. Prior to this, several SDA-aligned Labor MPs expressed public support for same-sex marriage in opposition to the SDA leadership including Kate Ellis, Amanda Rishworth and Nick Champion.

<doc id="1086163" wikidata="Q1500444" url="?curid=1086163" title="HMS Lion (1910)">
<text>HMS &quot;Lion&quot; was a battlecruiser built for the Royal Navy in the 1910s. She was the lead ship of her class, which were nicknamed the &quot;Splendid Cats&quot;. They were significant improvements over their predecessors of the in terms of speed, armament and armour. This was in response to the first German battlecruisers, the , which were very much larger and more powerful than the first British battlecruisers, the .

&quot;Lion&quot; served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s battlecruisers throughout World War I, except when she was being refitted or under repair. She sank the German light cruiser during the Battle of Heligoland Bight and served as Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s flagship at the Battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland. She was so badly damaged at the first of these battles that she had to be towed back to port and was under repair for more than two months. During the Battle of Jutland she suffered a serious propellant fire that could have destroyed the ship had it not been for the bravery of Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey, the gun turret commander, who posthumously received the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded. The fire destroyed one gun turret which had to be removed for rebuilding while she was under repair for several months. She spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although she did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917. She was put into reserve in 1920 and sold for scrap in 1924 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Design==
The &quot;Lion&quot;-class battlecruisers were designed to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the &quot;Moltke&quot; class as the German ships were to the &quot;Invincible&quot; class. The increase in speed, armour and gun size forced a 65 per cent increase in size over the &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class. &quot;Lion&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. The ship displaced at normal load and at deep load.

===Propulsion===

&quot;Lion&quot; had two paired sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two propeller shafts using steam provided by 42 Yarrow boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , but achieved more than during her trials, although she did not exceed her designed speed of . She carried of coal, and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of .

===Armament===
&quot;Lion&quot; mounted eight BL Mk V guns in four twin-gun turrets, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; from front to rear. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL Mark VII guns, most of which were mounted in casemates. The two guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were given gun shields during 1913–1914 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action. The starboard forward group of 4-inch guns was removed after April 1917.

She was built without anti-aircraft (AA) guns, but a single quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder (57 mm) Hotchkiss gun on a high-angle mounting was fitted from October 1914 to July 1915. A single QF AA gun was added in January 1915, and another the following July. Two  submerged torpedo tubes were fitted, one on each broadside; fourteen torpedoes were carried.

===Armour===
The armour protection given to the &quot;Lion&quot;s was heavier than that of the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s; their waterline belt of Krupp armour measured thick amidships. It thinned to 4 inches towards the ships&#x27; ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The upper armour belt had a maximum thickness of over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to abreast the end turrets. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour, except for the turret roofs which used . The thickness of the nickel steel deck ranged from . Nickel steel torpedo bulkheads 2.5 inches thick were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. After the Battle of Jutland revealed her vulnerability to plunging shellfire, of additional armour, weighing approximately , was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs.

===Wartime modifications===
&quot;Lion&quot; received a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing of the guns under the command of the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship&#x27;s roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.

By early 1918 &quot;Lion&quot; carried a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on flying-off platforms fitted on top of &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Lion&quot; was laid down at the Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth, on 29 November 1909. She was launched on 6 August 1910 and was commissioned on 4 June 1912. Upon commissioning, &quot;Lion&quot; became the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which was renamed the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) in January 1913. Rear Admiral Beatty assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913. &quot;Lion&quot;, along with the rest of the 1st BCS, made a port visit to Brest in February 1914 and the squadron visited Russia in June, where &quot;Lion&quot;″s officers entertained the Russian imperial family aboard while in Kronstadt.

===World War I===
====Battle of Heligoland Bight====

&quot;Lion&quot;″s first action was as flagship of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. Beatty&#x27;s ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case the large ships of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary. The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but &quot;Cöln&quot; remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. Beatty, however, was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser directly to his front. He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at close range–under . At 13:10 Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Beatty&#x27;s main body encountered the crippled &quot;Cöln&quot; shortly after turning north and she was sunk by two salvos from &quot;Lion&quot;.

====Raid on Scarborough====

The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would actually conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty&#x27;s 1st BCS, now reduced to four ships, including &quot;Lion&quot;, as well as Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender&#x27;s 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.

Admiral Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 05:15 and fought an inconclusive action with them. Warrender had received a signal at 05:40 that the destroyer was engaging enemy destroyers although Beatty had not. The destroyer spotted the German armoured cruiser and her escorts at about 07:00, but could not transmit the message until 07:25. Admiral Warrender received the signal, as did the battlecruiser , but Beatty did not, despite the fact that &quot;New Zealand&quot; had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty. Warrender attempted to pass on &quot;Shark&quot;″s message to Beatty at 07:36, but did not manage to make contact until 07:55. Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched &quot;New Zealand&quot; to search for &quot;Roon&quot;. She was being overhauled by &quot;New Zealand&quot; when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 09:00. Beatty ordered &quot;New Zealand&quot; to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.
The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank; Beatty&#x27;s ships passed to the north while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast. This left a gap between them through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. The light cruiser spotted the light cruiser and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30 Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper&#x27;s ships, however, those were some 50 km (31 mi) behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty&#x27;s ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.

====Battle of Dogger Bank====

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. However, the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty. Contact was initiated at 07:20 on the 24th when the British light cruiser &quot;Arethusa&quot; spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35 the Germans had spotted Beatty&#x27;s force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his north-west were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to &#x27;s maximum speed of if they were British battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, &quot;Lion&quot;, her sister and , were doing in pursuit and &quot;Lion&quot; opened fire at 08:52 at a range of . The other ships followed a few minutes later but, hampered by the extreme range and decreasing visibility, they did not score their first hit on &quot;Blücher&quot; until 09:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 09:11, at a range of , and concentrated their fire on &quot;Lion&quot;. They first hit her at 9:28 on the waterline with a shell that flooded a coal bunker. Shortly afterwards a shell from &quot;Blücher&quot; hit the roof of &#x27;A&#x27; turret, denting it and knocking out the left gun for two hours. At 09:35 Beatty signalled &#x27;Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy&#x27;s line&#x27;, but &quot;Tiger&quot;″s captain, believing that &quot;Indomitable&quot; was already engaging &quot;Blücher&quot;, fired at , as did &quot;Lion&quot;, which left unengaged and able to continue to engage &quot;Lion&quot; without risk. However, &quot;Lion&quot; scored the first serious hit of the battle when one of her shells penetrated the working chamber of &quot;Seydlitz&quot;″s rear barbette at 09:40 and ignited the propellant lying exposed. The resulting fire spread into the other turret and burnt out both of them, killing 159 men. &quot;Seydlitz&quot; returned the damage at 10:01 with a shell that ricocheted off the water and pierced &quot;Lion&quot;″s five-inch armour aft, although it failed to explode. However, the resulting hole flooded the low power switchboard compartment and eventually shorted out two of &quot;Lion&quot;″s three dynamos. scored the most telling hits on &quot;Lion&quot; at 10:18 when two shells struck her port side below the waterline. The shock was so great that her captain, Ernle Chatfield, thought that she had been torpedoed. One shell pierced the five-inch armour forward and burst in a wing compartment behind the armour. It drove in a piece of armour and flooded several compartments adjacent to the torpedo flat and the torpedo body room. One splinter put a hole in the exhaust pipe of the capstan engine which eventually contaminated the auxiliary condenser with saltwater. The other shell hit further aft and burst on the six-inch portion of the waterline belt. It drove in two armour plates about and flooded some of the lower coal bunkers. At 10:41 a 283 mm shell burst against the eight-inch armour of &#x27;A&#x27; barbette, but only started a small fire in the &#x27;A&#x27; turret lobby that was quickly put out, although the magazine was partially flooded when a false report was received that it was on fire as well. Soon afterwards &quot;Lion&quot; was hit by a number of shells in quick succession, but only one of these was serious. A shell burst on the nine-inch armour belt abreast the engine room and drove a armour plate about two feet inboard and ruptured the port engine&#x27;s feedwater tank. By 10:52 &quot;Lion&quot; had been hit fourteen times and had taken aboard some of water which gave her a list of 10° to port and reduced her speed. Shortly afterwards her port engine broke down and her speed dropped to .
In the meantime &quot;Blücher&quot; had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers; her speed had dropped to and her steering gear had been jammed. Beatty ordered to attack her at 10:48. Six minutes later Beatty spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90° turn to port to avoid the submarine, although he failed to hoist the &#x27;Submarine Warning&#x27; flag because most of &quot;Lion&quot;″s signal halyards had been shot away. Almost immediately afterwards &quot;Lion&quot; lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water which knocked out all remaining light and power. He ordered &#x27;Course Northeast&#x27; at 11:02 to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper. He also hoisted &#x27;Attack the rear of the enemy&#x27; on the other halyard although there was no connection between the two signals. This caused Rear-Admiral Sir Gordon Moore, temporarily commanding in , to think that the signals meant to attack &quot;Blücher&quot;, which was about to the northeast, so they turned away from the pursuit of Hipper&#x27;s main body and engaged &quot;Blücher&quot;. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze.

&quot;Lion&quot;″s starboard engine was temporarily shut down due to contaminated feed water, but it was restarted and &quot;Lion&quot; headed home at when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her around 12:45. At 14:30 the starboard engine began to fail and her speed was reduced to . &quot;Indomitable&quot; was ordered to tow &quot;Lion&quot; back to port at 15:00, but it took two hours and two tries before she could start to tow &quot;Lion&quot;, and a further day-and-a-half to reach port at speeds of , even after &quot;Lion&quot;″s starboard engine was temporarily repaired.

&quot;Lion&quot; was temporarily repaired at Rosyth with timber and concrete before sailing to Newcastle upon Tyne to be repaired by Palmers; the Admiralty did not wish it known that she was damaged badly enough to require repair at either Portsmouth or Devonport Dockyards lest that be seen as a sign of defeat. She was heeled 8° to starboard with four cofferdams in place between 9 February and 28 March to repair about of bottom plating and replace five armour plates and their supporting structure. She rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet, again as Beatty&#x27;s flagship, on 7 April. She had fired 243 rounds from her main guns, but had only made four hits: one each on &quot;Blücher&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;, and two on &quot;Seydlitz&quot;. In return she had been hit by the Germans sixteen times, but only suffered one man killed and twenty wounded.

====Battle of Jutland====

On 31 May 1916 &quot;Lion&quot; was the flagship of Admiral Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty&#x27;s ships did not spot the Germans to their east until ten minutes later. Almost immediately afterwards, at 15:32, he ordered a course change to east-south-east to position himself astride the Germans&#x27; line of retreat and called his ships&#x27; crews to action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.
This began what was to be called the &#x27;Run to the South&#x27; as Beatty changed course to steer east-south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed almost immediately afterwards by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, &quot;Lion&quot; and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. &quot;Lion&quot;, as the leading British ship, engaged , her opposite number in the German formation. &quot;Lützow&quot;″s fire was very accurate, and &quot;Lion&quot; was hit twice within three minutes of the Germans&#x27; opening fire. By 15:54 the range was down to , and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57. &quot;Lion&quot; scored her first hit on &quot;Lützow&quot; two minutes later, but &quot;Lützow&quot; returned the favour at 16:00 when one of her 305 mm shells hit &#x27;Q&#x27; turret at a range of . The shell penetrated the joint between the nine-inch turret faceplate and the 3.5-inch roof and detonated over the centre of the left-hand gun. It blew the front roof plate and the centre faceplate off the turret, killed or wounded everyone in the turret, and started a fire that smouldered, despite efforts to put it out that had been thought to have been successful. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the eight full propellant charges in the turret working room at 16:28. They burned violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting. The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors, and the magazine would probably have exploded if it had not already been flooded. Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey, the mortally wounded turret commander, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded.
At 16:11 &quot;Lion&quot; observed the track of a torpedo fired by &quot;Moltke&quot; pass astern, but it was thought that the torpedo was fired by a U-boat on the disengaged side. This was confirmed when the destroyer reported having spotted a periscope before the torpedo tracks were seen. The range had grown too far for accurate shooting so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This resulted in &quot;Lion&quot; hitting &quot;Lützow&quot; again at 16:14, but &quot;Lützow&quot; hit &quot;Lion&quot; several times in return shortly afterwards. The smoke and haze from these hits caused &quot;Lützow&quot; to lose sight of &quot;Lion&quot;, and she switched her fire to at 16:16. By 16:25 the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. However, it was too late for &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, which was hit multiple times in quick succession about that time, and her forward magazines exploded. At 16:30 the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty&#x27;s ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer&#x27;s battleships, but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen-point turn to starboard in succession.

&quot;Lion&quot; was hit twice more, during what came to be called the &#x27;Run to the North&#x27;, after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty&#x27;s ships maintained full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet. At 17:40 they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 17:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 18:35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-south-east, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 18:44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south-south-east four minutes later searching for Hipper&#x27;s ships. Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of &quot;New Zealand&quot; and then slowed down to eighteen knots and altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet. At this moment &quot;Lion&quot;″s gyrocompass failed, and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again. At 18:55 Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer&#x27;s T, and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 19:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.
This manoeuvre was successful, and the British lost sight of the Germans until 20:05, when the light cruiser spotted smoke bearing west-north-west. Ten minutes later she had closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and had engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. &quot;Inflexible&quot; opened fire at 20:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. Shortly after 20:30 the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve&#x27;s II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans were able to fire only a few rounds at them because of the poor visibility and turned away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 20:40. After this Beatty changed course to south-southeast and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 02:55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course.

&quot;Lion&quot; and the rest of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth on the morning of 2 June 1916 where she began repairs that lasted until 19 July. The remains of &#x27;Q&#x27; turret were removed during this period and not replaced until later. She had been hit a total of fourteen times and suffered 99 dead and 51 wounded during the battle. She fired 326 rounds from her main guns, but can only be credited with four hits on &quot;Lützow&quot; and one on . She also fired seven torpedoes, four at the German battleships, two at &quot;Derfflinger&quot; and one at the light cruiser without success.

===Post-Jutland career===
She rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet, again as Beatty&#x27;s flagship, on 19 July 1916 without &#x27;Q&#x27; turret, but then had the turret replaced during a visit to Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick that lasted from 6 to 23 September. In the meantime, on the evening of 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers. Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having realised their mistake the Germans then shaped course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home, the British having lost two cruisers to submarine attacks and the Germans having a dreadnought damaged by torpedo.
&quot;Lion&quot; became the flagship of Vice-Admiral W. C. Pakenham in December 1916 when he assumed command of the Battlecruiser Fleet upon Beatty&#x27;s promotion to command of the Grand Fleet. &quot;Lion&quot; had an uneventful time for the rest of the war, conducting patrols of the North Sea as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces. The 1st BCS, including &quot;Lion&quot;, sailed on 12 December in a futile attempt to intercept the German destroyers that had sunk the convoy en route to Norway earlier that day, but returned to base the following day. &quot;Lion&quot;, along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. When the High Seas Fleet sailed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 to be interned, she was among the escorting ships. Along with the rest of the 1st BCS she guarded the interned ships until she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919 and then placed in reserve in March 1920. Paid off on 30 March 1922, despite a press campaign to have her saved for the nation as a memorial, &quot;Lion&quot; was sold for scrap on 31 January 1924 for £77,000 to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty.

<text>The US Navy Steel Band was the first all-American and only military steel band. It was organized in 1957 by Rear Admiral Daniel V. Gallery, from the band assigned to him, while he was commander of the Tenth Naval District in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The band was originally called Admiral Dan&#x27;s Pandemonaics and this remained as a subname after they became the US Navy Steel Band. The band was stationed in Puerto Rico until 1973, when they moved to New Orleans, LA. From there, stationed at Naval Support Activity New Orleans in the Algiers section of the city, they increased their performance schedule. Between 1973 and 1979 alone the band traveled over a million and a half miles, and performed as many as 500 concerts a year. They were disbanded in 1999.

Their first recording, in 1957, under the direction of Chief Musician Charles A. Roeper, on the Decca label, was an LP called &quot;Pan-Demonia&quot;. Among their other recordings are an LP called &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; that was co-issued by the Puerto Rico Council and the U. S. Navy League; it features numerous popular songs of the day and some traditional Puerto Rican songs (all instrumentals).

<text>Groß-Umstadt is a town in the district of Darmstadt-Dieburg in the Bundesland (federal state) of Hesse in Germany. It is near Darmstadt and Frankfurt, in the southeastern part of the Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, just north of the Odenwald mountain range.

The population is about 21,000. Half of them live in Groß-Umstadt itself, the remainder in eight other districts which were incorporated by the &quot;Hesse State Municipal Reform Act&quot; in the 1970s:
* Dorndiel
* Heubach
* Kleestadt
* Klein-Umstadt
* Raibach
* Richen
* Semd
* Wiebelsbach (also includes village Frau-Nauses).

==History==
Traces of palaeolithic habitation have been identified outside the town.

The settlement of Civitas Auderiensium was founded at Dieburg in AD 125 in the context of the Roman occupation of the section of the province of Germania Superior on the right bank of the Rhine. The foundation was followed by an orderly settlement and Romanisation of the district, and a market for agricultural produce was established. The main building of a Roman &quot;villa rustica&quot; has been excavated under the current town church. This villa remained until the collapse of the Alemanni around AD 300. The town&#x27;s history over the following 450 years until the first documentary evidence of the town is unclear. Alemannic and later Frankish tombs point to a settlement in the area of the town. The siting of the church in the core area of the former villa indicates an uninterrupted settlement, or at least to awareness of the previous settlement.

===Early mediaeval period===
After the conquest of Alemannic territory by the Franks, they established royal fortifications in order to secure control of the area. One such was undoubtedly established in Umstadt, the center of government of the &quot;Umstaedter Mark&quot;, which included the current municipalities of Otzberg, Höchst im Odenwald, Breuberg and Schaafheim as well as Umstadt itself. At that time Umstadt had the status of a market town as well as a church and the seat of a Count. The first documentary evidence of the district was in 743 under the name of &quot;Autmundisstat&quot;, which signified &quot;Autmund&#x27;s town&quot; (possibly Edmund&#x27;s). Another possible origin of the name is &quot;ad montes&quot; (near the mountains). In 766 Princely Abbey of Fulda acquired the ownership of the &quot;Umstaedter Mark&quot;, and by 985 it owned three churches, mills and vineyards here.

===Late mediaeval period===
By 1263 or earlier, Umstadt had obtained town privileges as well as a town wall.

Konrad IV of Hanau incurred substantial debts in connection with his election as Prince Abbot of Fulda in 1373. He attempted to recoup these debts from the Princely abbey of Fulda after he came to power. Thus in 1374 he mortgaged the Otzberg Castle, the town of Hering and parts of Umstadt to his nephew Ulrich IV for 23,875 guilders &quot;(florins)&quot;. Other parts were taken over by Electoral Palatinate, resulting in a condominium. There is physical evidence for this in two palaces: the &quot;Hanau Palace&quot; () which originated from the first moated palace at the town&#x27;s NE corner, and the &quot;Palatinate Palace&quot; () at the opposite corner. Between these were the mansions of the burghers of the town, including the seat of the Wambolts of Umstadt, which soon eclipsed the palaces of both lords of the town.

===Early modern period===
In 1504 the town was conquered by Landgrave Wilhelm II of Hesse, who occupied it until the ownership of the town was clarified by the Diet of Worms in 1521. This resulted in another condominium, this time between Hesse and the Palatinate. As compensation Hanau received 12,000 guilders and several nearby villages, viz. Harpertshausen, Kleestadt, Langstadt and Schlierbach.

Under this common ownership the town developed until shortly before the Thirty Years&#x27; War; the still extant town hall was built from 1596.

During the war the town was protected by its strong fortifications, preventing major destruction, but nevertheless there was great suffering, not least during the plague in 1634–36.

The town was briefly occupied and laid waste by a force of 600 dragoons under the Marquis of Barbistere in December 1688 during the War of the Palatine Succession.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In 1802 the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt took over the joint dominion of the town, which was the 2nd most important town of the district of Dieburg which was founded at that time. From 1857 the town adopted the name of Gross-Umstadt to distinguish it from Klein-Umstadt and Wenigumstadt. Many factories were established in the town after it obtained a railway connection.

In the election of 1933, 60% of the inhabitants voted for the Nazis, and in 1938 the town&#x27;s synagogue was desecrated. After WW2 the town&#x27;s population grew to about 22,500 following several expansions to its boundaries. There is now a substantial Portuguese community.

<doc id="1086173" wikidata="Q3278236" url="?curid=1086173" title="Mess dress uniform">
<text>Mess dress uniform is the most formal (or semi-formal, depending on the country) type of evening-wear uniform used by military personnel, police personnel, and other uniformed services members. It frequently consists of a mess jacket, trousers, white dress shirt and a black bow tie, along with orders and medals insignia. Design may depend on regiment or service branch, e.g. army, navy, air force, marines, etc. In modern Western dress codes, mess dress uniform is the supplementary alternative equivalent to the civilian black tie for evening wear. Mess dress uniforms are typically less formal than full dress uniform, but more formal than service dress uniform.

Prior to World War II, this style of military uniform was largely restricted to the British and United States Armed Forces, although the French, German, Swedish and other navies had adopted their own versions of mess dress during the late 19th century, influenced by the British Royal Navy.

While mess dress uniform is predominantly worn at occasions by commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers, it may also be worn as an optional uniform by some senior enlisted personnel. It is also sometimes worn by members of royal courts or certain civilian uniformed services.

==Name==
Mess dress uniform is also known as &quot;mess uniform&quot; and, more informally, as &quot;mess kit&quot;.

==Australia==

The Australian Army has separate mess kits for summer and winter. The summer mess kit is a white jacket, almost identical between different branches of the army. The winter mess kit is made of thicker material, with jackets in the colour (scarlet or dark blue) of the wearers&#x27; corps. The winter mess dress includes a waistcoat. Both kits have the same barrathea blue trousers, but trousers vary in the colour and width of leg stripe denoting corps. Women&#x27;s mess attire is the same, except that women may wear a skirt instead of trousers. Both versions are worn with a bow tie and white shirt; Marcella for winter and plain for summer.

The Royal Australian Air Force has different mess uniforms for summer and winter. The summer mess kit is marked out by a white jacket while the winter jacket is dark blue.

==Belgium==
The official name of the Belgian Armed Forces mess dress is &quot;Tenue 1C&quot; or &quot;Spencer&quot;. It is worn only after 18:00 hours, at ceremonies in the presence of the King, a member of the royal family or a foreign head of state. It can also be worn when civilians are in white or black tie.

It consists of a dark-blue jacket with two golden buttons linked by a chain closure, dark-blue trousers and a low-cut marcella waistcoat. The waistcoat is of the regimental or corps colour. Regimental colours also figure on the edge of the shoulder straps. This is matched by a white dress shirt and a black bow tie. The ranks are embroidered onto the peak lapels of the jacket, except for the Navy, where the rank curls are placed at the bottom of the sleeves.

The spencer dress is allowed for all ranks. Generals and cavalry, horse artillery or logistical officers may wear spurs. 
Women wear similar dress, with a long dark blue skirt, and black lace instead of the bow tie.

It is distinct from 1A Dress (&quot;Groot Galatenue&quot;/&quot;Grande Tenue de Gala&quot;) or 1B Dress (&quot;Galatenue&quot;/&quot;Tenue de Gala&quot;), which resembles the British Army N°1 Blue Dress. These orders are worn for weddings, military ceremonies and &quot;repas de corps&quot;.

An oversea version with a white jacket is available to Navy personnel (Tenue 5H1).

==Canada==

Mess dress is worn as formal evening attire for mess dinners. Uniforms range from full mess dress (with dinner jackets, cummerbunds or waistcoats) to service dress worn with a bow tie for individuals not required to own mess dress (non-commissioned members and members of the Reserve Force). Mess dress is not provided at public expense. All commissioned officers of the Regular Force are required to own mess dress within six months of being commissioned.
The winter mess dress (No. 2) for the Royal Canadian Navy consists of a navy blue jacket with gold laced rank insignia worn on the sleeve, gold-laced navy blue trousers worn by all commissioned officers (unlike in the Royal Navy they are not restricted to captains and flag officers), white shirt with soft or wing collar, and a white waistcoat. Officers of the rank of Captain(N) and above wear a tailcoat instead of the standard jacket. NCMs trousers are the same pattern, but without gold lace down the seam. Miniatures of medals earned are worn on the left lapel; regular size qualification badges earned are worn on the left sleeve, above the rank insignia (as they are worn in the Royal Navy for naval aviators). Summer mess dress (No. 2A) is similar except that a white jacket with rank insignia on navy blue shoulder boards (gold covered for flag officers) is worn, with either a waistcoat or cummerbund.

The winter standard pattern mess dress (No. 2) for the Canadian Army consists of a scarlet jacket with rank insignia worn on soft shoulder loops, scarlet-laced dark blue (almost black) trousers, white shirt with soft or wing collar and dark blue waistcoat. The details of regimental distinctions vary by regiments and are defined in detail in the Canadian Forces Dress Instructions. Miniature medals are worn on the left breast below miniatures of qualification badges earned. The summer standard pattern mess dress is similar except that a white jacket with rank insignia worn on black shoulder boards, and cummerbund, is worn. Army reserve regiments are authorized to wear mess dress that is distinctive to the regiment and which can consist of jackets of different cuts (for example high collar) and colours, rather than the standard pattern mess dress. Authorized summer dress (No. 2A), consisting of the white jacket in lieu of scarlet, varies from regiment to regiment, but typically is not authorized for NCMs below the rank of Warrant Officer.

The winter mess dress of the Royal Canadian Air Force consists of a midnight blue jacket with gold rank insignia worn on the sleeve, black-laced midnight blue trousers, white shirt with soft collar, and a cummerbund in the colours of the Royal Canadian Air Force tartan. Miniature medals are worn on the left breast above miniatures of qualification badges earned. The summer mess dress (No. 2A) is similar except that a white jacket with rank insignia worn on midnight blue shoulder boards is worn, and is authorized as an optional order for RCAF officers only.

No. 2B is authorized as an alternative for Regular Force officers who have not yet purchased mess uniform, and for Reserve Force officers and all NCMs as they are not required to purchase mess uniform. It applies to all three elements and consists of the standard service dress uniform appropriate to the element (rifle green for the Army, navy blue for the RCN and light blue for the RCAF), a white long-sleeved shirt (as issued to navy personnel) and a black bow tie. Undress ribbons and nametag are worn.

No. 2C is a relaxed, ship-board only order of mess uniform, worn by members of all elements when dining formally onboard HMC Ships at sea. It consists of the service short sleeve shirt and service dress trousers appropriate to the element, and a cummerbund in black or authorized regimental colours. Name tag, medals/ribbons are not worn.

No. 2D is the CF standard pattern mess dress, now superseded, which was authorized for wear prior to the reversion to separate environmental uniforms for Army, Navy and Air Force. It is identical to Air Force No. 2 dress, except that buttons and other accoutrements reflect the unified CF uniform prevalent from 1968 to circa 1987. It is authorized for wear by personnel who had joined &quot;and acquired their mess uniform&quot; before the re-establishment of distinctive environmental uniforms.

==France==

Until World War II officers of the French Army wore their full dress (&quot;grande tenue&quot;) uniforms for evening as well as daytime formal and ceremonial occasions. Naval officers however had a special mess uniform similar in style to that of the Royal Navy.

Since the 1950s, officers of all service branches of the French Armed Forces, including joint services such as the Health Service, have a mess dress known as &quot;Tenue 1A&quot;.

It consists of a night blue jacket with ornamented shoulder straps with rank insignia, night blue trousers, a white shirt, a black bow tie, a night blue cummerbund, black polished shoes and black socks.

Women wear a similar uniform, with a night blue long skirt, a white satiny shirt and a white satiny bow tie.&lt;br&gt;
Headdress, a night blue cloak and white gloves may be worn outside only.

Fourragères and aiguillettes are not worn, with the exception of the aiguillette obtained for individual merits.&lt;br&gt;
Miniature medals are worn for most decorations, only the recipients of national orders above the rank of Commandeur may wear the collar and sash.

An overseas version with a white jacket is available.

==Germany==
Mess uniforms were worn by officers of the Imperial German Navy, though not by army officers. During the 1930s in Nazi Germany, officers of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) had the option of purchasing mess dress uniforms. SS mess dress resembled a double-breasted dinner jacket, with collar tabs and white piping.

In modern Germany, mess dress is a permitted uniform for officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) of the Bundeswehr attending white or black tie festive social occasions. Female soldiers wear a long dark-blue skirt and a white blouse with the &quot;Bundesadler&quot; (&quot;Federal Eagle&quot; coat of arms) on the right collar. This is combined with a long scarf across the chest and a dark blue short velvet jacket. A variant with a short white silk jacket combined with a blue blouse is also permitted. Purses and other accessories may be carried.

The basic mess dress (&quot;Grundform&quot;) for men consists of a jacket with a chain closure, trousers with black silk trim strips, and either a cummerbund (army, air force, navy) or a &quot;Torerobund&quot; (a torero-style waist sash, for the army and air force). These sashes or cummerbunds are of black fabric for the army and dark blue for the air force and navy. The chain is gold for the navy and for army and air force generals; others wear a silver chain. This is matched by a white dress shirt (with a concealed placket; no stand-up collars, ruffles, or embroidery) and a black bow tie and black or black patent leather shoes.

As a variation, a black smoking jacket with black silk collar and black silk-covered passant (Army, Air Force) may be worn instead. The ranks are embroidered onto the epaulettes. The jacket is worn without cuff titles, collar patches, or any other coloured insignia. In the navy, rank insignia is placed on the sleeves. Activity, proficiency, or specialist badges are often included in the embroidered portion. Miniature versions of any orders and decorations are worn from ribbons.

==Greece==
The mess dress of the Hellenic Armed Forces, adopted in 1953, resembles the &quot;rolled collar&quot; jacket, waistcoat and trousers pattern of the British Army as described in this article. It is classed as no. 4 dress. Colours are those of the historic full dress uniform of the particular branch or service (e.g. medium green with crimson facings for armored cavalry officers, dark blue with red facings for infantry officers). A white version is authorized for summer wear.

==Indonesia==
The Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) version of the mess dress uniform is categorized in the &quot;PDU&quot; (&quot;Pakaian Dinas Upacara&quot;) or &quot;full dress uniform&quot; type &quot;II&quot; / PDU No. 2. It is only worn by officers, and is worn when attending state-level banquets and official receptions in or outside the country.

==Israel==
In keeping with the Israel Defense Forces&#x27; doctrine of a People&#x27;s Army, mess uniform is not worn inside Israel. It takes the form of a khaki service uniform rather than the special evening dress as worn by many other nations. It is only worn abroad, either by military attachés or by senior officers on official state visits. These rules also apply to the IDF dress uniform. Because of the small number of uniforms required they are bespoke tailored for the specific officer. The mess uniforms are the only Israeli army order of dress to include a tie, and have a summer version and a winter version.

==Jamaica==
Both senior non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers of the Jamaica Defence Force may wear (No. 5 Dress) mess kit.

==New Zealand==

The Royal New Zealand Navy, New Zealand Army, and Royal New Zealand Air Force have mess uniforms of similar style to those worn by the equivalent British and Australian services.

New Zealand Army mess uniforms authorised for officers were simplified about 2000 in that the distinctive corps and regimental colours previously worn were replaced by a universal scarlet and blue pattern with only insignia distinguishing one branch or unit from another.

Royal New Zealand Air Force mess dress consists of grey/blue jackets, trousers and waistcoats with white shirts and black bow ties. Any medals are displayed above the left breast pocket. Individual flying squadron colours appear on mess dress belts worn by officers. Senior NCOs (sergeants, flight sergeants, and warrant officers) also wear mess dress for various special functions.

==Norway==

The Norwegian Army has no specific mess uniform, but uses its parade uniform or service uniform as appropriate.

The Royal Norwegian Navy uses a navy blue hooded jacket and waistcoat. As in the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the mess jacket is used with a white waistcoat for gala events.

==Russia and the former USSR ==

While officially the Soviet and post-Soviet military forces do not wear mess uniform, a version of it was introduced in July 1969 for senior generals only (), who wore light-grey tunics on special occasions (mostly reception of state awards). This uniform was abandoned in the 1990s but reintroduced under President Putin, again for senior generals only. The grey tunic uniform should be distinguished from the blue or dark green full-dress parade uniform regularly worn on holidays and ceremonies ().

==Sweden==
===Full mess dress===

Swedish full mess dress (known as &quot;stor mässdräkt&quot;) is formal wear to be worn on occasions when a civilian would wear white tie or a morning dress. The Swedish Army code for full mess dress is m/86, the navy is m/1878, and the air force m/1938. The numbers represent the year in which the style was introduced. The full mess dress is thus the equivalent of full dress uniform for units which don&#x27;t have their unit-specific full dress uniform traditions.

The uniforms consist of:
* dark blue mess jacket
* white waistcoat; a white waist sash for female personnel
* dark blue long trousers with piping; dark blue long skirt for female personnel
* dress coat; female personnel wear a white spread-collared, ruffle front blouse
* black bow tie
* dark blue cap (with certain variations between the branches)
* black socks
* black plain-toe, lace-up shoes (patent leather is an option); female personnel wears black ladies&#x27; shoes (again with variations)
* white gloves

Additional clothing includes a cloak (akin to the boat coat), galoshes, and a scarf, as well as any medals. With the full mess dress one may also wear braces or a waistcoat in one&#x27;s branch colours.

===Lesser mess dress===
The &quot;lesser&quot; (&quot;liten&quot;) and &quot;full&quot; (&quot;stor&quot;) mess dress are two uniforms of the Swedish Armed Forces uniform subgroup of &quot;social uniforms&quot; (&quot;sällskapsuniformer&quot;). Aside from mess dress, this group also includes &quot;formal wear&quot; and &quot;society wear&quot;. The Swedish lesser mess dress is the equivalent of the civilian black tie. It is the same as the British &quot;mess undress&quot; or the American &quot;mess dress blues&quot;.

It differs from the full mess dress in a number of ways:
* the waistcoat/waist sash is dark blue; white is permitted if the gathering includes civilians
* there is no piping on the trousers

Mess dress is a permitted uniform, in that it is allowed to be worn on defined occasions, but possession is not obligatory. There is always a corresponding form of obligatory uniform that may be worn as an alternative (army: m/87 A, navy: m/48, air force: m/87). Full mess dress is thus matched by &quot;högtidsdräkt&quot; (formal wear) and the lesser mess dress by &quot;sällskapsdräkt&quot; (society wear). Formal wear is the same as parade dress, when worn at the equivalent of a white tie occasion. &quot;Society wear&quot; is the service dress uniform, when worn to a black-tie occasion. Formal and society wear (rather than mess dress) are the mandatory uniform types for any military event, funeral, parade, state visit, or any other non-festive occasion.

==United Kingdom==
===The Royal Household===

The officers of some ceremonial military corps, such as the Yeomen of the Guard and Gentlemen at Arms, are authorised to wear the evening dress of the Royal Household court uniform as a mess dress.

===Royal Navy===

The Royal Navy distinguishes between mess dress, which is now the equivalent of civilian white tie, and mess undress, which is the equivalent of black tie.

Before 1939, there were three forms of evening dress:

* Ball dress (No. 2) – undress tailcoat, gold epaulettes, gold-laced trousers, white waistcoat, black bow tie, cocked hat
* Mess dress (No. 7) – mess jacket, gold-laced trousers, blue waistcoat, black bow tie, peaked cap. 
* Mess undress (No. 8) – mess jacket, plain trousers, blue waistcoat, black bow tie, peaked cap.

Today, there are only two forms of evening dress:

* Mess dress (No. 2A) – mess jacket, plain navy blue mess trousers, white waistcoat, black bow tie, peaked cap. 
* Mess undress (No. 2B) – mess jacket, plain navy blue mess trousers, blue waistcoat or black cummerbund, black bow tie, peaked cap.

Officers of the rank of captain and above wear gold-laced trousers (the gold lace stripes are nicknamed &quot;lightning conductors&quot;), and may wear the undress tailcoat (without epaulettes), with either mess dress or mess undress. The undress tailcoat is so named to distinguish it from the full dress tailcoat that was worn during the day with full dress (No. 1), which is worn in a modified form by admirals today as ceremonial day dress. Both the undress tailcoat and the mess jacket are double-breasted, with peaked lapels and six gilt buttons, but cut to be worn single-breasted and fastened at the front with two linked gilt buttons. The undress tailcoat is fitted with scallop-flapped hip pockets with three gilt buttons on each pocket. Rank is indicated on the undress tailcoat and mess jacket by gold lace on the sleeves. When tropical rig is ordered, a white, double breasted mess jacket with a shawl collar is worn instead of the blue, with shoulder boards to indicate rank. The peaked cap can (optionally) be worn with both mess undress and mess dress.

Senior rates-Warrant Officers (of both grades), Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officer- may either wear their Number 1 Dress uniform with a bow tie and medal ribbons, or they may optionally wear a navy blue mess jacket with shawl collar that is worn with the black cummerbund and a white Marcella shirt and navy blue mess trousers. The relevant cuff buttons indicating rate are worn by Petty Officers and Chief Petty Officers, and miniature rate badges are worn on the upper left arm of the mess jacket by petty officers, and on the sleeve by both grades of Warrant officers. Miniature medals are also worn. Trade badges are not worn in this rig. In tropical climates, either a white bush jacket (as in number 1 rig) is worn with medal ribbons, or optionally; a white mess jacket similar to that worn by officers is optionally worn, only without shoulderboards.

Mess dress and mess undress are today worn with a soft marcella-fronted shirt with a soft collar. Stiff marcella-fronted shirts and stiff wing collars were previously worn with all forms of evening dress, but were abolished first for mess undress, and finally in the mid-1990s for mess dress. Rear admirals and above may continue to wear the stiff shirt and collar with mess dress. Cummerbunds, which may be worn with mess undress instead of the blue waistcoat and with Red Sea rig (No. 2C), are frequently decorated with badges or colours proper to the ship or establishment in which the officer serves. For example, HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; – Black Watch tartan; HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; – green with the ship&#x27;s logo (three crossed trumpets) in gold; Royal Naval Engineering College (RNEC) – engineers&#x27; purple with the RNEC lettering in gold. Traditionally, half-Wellington boots were worn with mess dress and mess undress, but today shoes are more common. The optional outer garment worn with evening dress is the boat cloak, which is a knee-length navy blue cloak lined with white silk, with four gilt buttons, and fastened at the neck with two gilt lions&#x27; heads joined with a chain. Miniature medals are worn with both mess dress and mess undress, though previously medal ribbons only were worn with mess undress on routine occasions, such as by the officer of the day. Officers who are members of orders of chivalry wear their stars and ribbons as appropriate.

The Elder Brethren of Trinity House are authorised to wear a mess dress based upon that of a Royal Navy captain.

===British Army===
Mess uniforms first appeared in the British Army in about 1845, initially utilizing the short &quot;shell jacket&quot; worn since 1831. This working jacket was worn open over a regimental waistcoat for evening dress. The original purpose was to provide a relatively comfortable and inexpensive alternative to the stiff and elaborate full-dress uniforms then worn by officers for evening social functions such as regimental dinners or balls. With the general disappearance of full dress uniforms after World War I, mess dress became the most colourful and traditional uniform to be retained by most officers in British and Commonwealth armies. Immediately after World War II the cheaper &quot;blue patrols&quot; were worn for several years as mess dress, but by 1956 the traditional uniforms had been readopted.

The formal designation of the most commonly worn mess uniform in the British Army is &quot;No. 10 (Temperate) Mess Dress&quot;. The form varies according to regiment or corps, but generally a short mess jacket is worn, which either fastens at the neck (being cut away to show the waistcoat, this being traditionally the style worn by cavalry regiments and other mounted corps), or is worn with a white shirt and black bow tie (traditionally the usual style for unmounted regiments, corps, and services). Since regimental amalgamations, the &quot;cut away&quot; or cavalry-style jacket has been adopted by some British Army infantry regiments such as the Royal Regiment of Wales, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, and corps such as the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps and the Royal Logistic Corps. Officers of the Foot Guards, Royal Engineers, the Parachute Regiment, the Royal Army Medical Corps, and the Royal Regiment of Scotland amongst others still wear the infantry style of jacket.

The colours of mess jackets and trousers reflect those of the traditional full dress uniforms of the regiments in question, as worn until at least 1914. Jackets are, therefore, usually scarlet, dark blue, or rifle green, with collars, cuffs, waistcoats, or lapels in the former facing colours of the regiments in question. In the case of those regiments which have undergone amalgamation, features of the former uniforms are often combined. Waistcoats are often richly embroidered, though with modern modifications, such as a core of cotton for gold cording instead of the thick gold cord which made these items very expensive prior to World War II. Non-commissioned officers&#x27; mess dress is usually simpler in design, but in the same colours as officers of their regiment.

Most British Army regiments&#x27; mess dress incorporates high-waisted, very tight trousers known as overalls, the bottoms of which buckle under leather Wellington or George boots. Ornamental spurs are usually worn by cavalry regiments and corps that traditionally were mounted; some other regiments and corps prescribe spurs for field officers, since in former times these officers would have been mounted. The Rifles do not wear spurs at any rank, following Light Infantry traditions since historically no Light Infantry officer rode on horseback. Scottish regiments wear kilts or tartan trews, and some wear tartan waistcoats as well.

In &quot;No. 11 Warm Weather Mess Dress&quot;, a white drill hip-length jacket is worn with either a waistcoat in the same material or a cummerbund of regimental pattern. Blue and various shades of red or green are the most common colours for the cummerbund. Trousers or overalls are the same as in No. 10 Dress.

Female officers and soldiers wear mess jackets in a pattern similar to those of their male counterparts over dark-coloured ankle-length evening dresses. Black hand bags may be carried, and black evening shoes are worn.

===Royal Air Force===

No. 5 Mess dress in the Royal Air Force is similar to that in the Royal Navy, except that the jacket and trousers are in mid-blue. For the most formal white tie occasions, such as state dinners, court balls and royal evening receptions, a white bow tie is worn with a white waistcoat (No. 5A). For all other evening events, a black bow tie with a mid-blue waistcoat (No. 5B) or a slate grey cummerbund (No. 5) is worn. Cummerbunds of a particular squadron or unit design may also be worn. Among Scottish-based units, a kilt of grey Clan Douglas tartan was initially authorised, but the recently approved official RAF tartan is now authorised. The tartan, designed in 1988, was officially recognised by the Ministry of Defence in 2001. A variation of No. 1 Service Dress (SD) is also permitted; the usual blue shirt and black tie are replaced with a white shirt and black bow tie. This dress is referred to as No. 4 Mess Dress. In warm weather regions, a lightweight white jacket is substituted for the No. 5 mid-blue jacket. This uniform is designated No. 8 mess dress..

For women, mess dress currently consists of the same style high-waisted blue-grey single-breasted jacket and white marcella shirt as men, a small bow tie and cummerbund, and a straight ankle-length blue-gray skirt, worn with patent-leather court shoes and barely-black tights or stockings. Unlike the gentlemen officers&#x27; jacket, which has a pointed lapel, the ladies&#x27; jacket features a shawl collar. From the 1970s and prior to the introduction of current women&#x27;s mess dress in 1996, female officers wore a royal blue Empire line dress made of crimplene material with a loose mandarin neck, long sleeves, and an ankle length hem. Rank was indicated on a small enamelled brooch worn near the neck.

===British police===

Police officers may wear mess dress to formal dinners if appropriate, but is it most typically worn by officers who have achieved the rank of superintendent or above. The mess dress of the Metropolitan Police is dark blue with black cuffs and a black &#x27;roll&#x27; collar having an embroidered badge (Brunswick star) on each lapel. That of the commissioner includes a two-inch oak leaf lace strip on the trousers and a set of aiguillettes. A matching black waistcoat is worn and badges of rank are displayed on the epaulettes.

==United States==
The use of mess dress in the United States Uniformed Services started in the early 20th century.

===U.S. Army===

In 1902, when the U.S. Army adopted its last standing collar blue uniform for full dress, a modified form of civilian tail coat was also introduced for evening dress, worn with a white tie and vest. This was known as the special uniform for evening wear. At the same time, a mess uniform resembling the British pattern was authorized for less formal evening occasions. The short mess jacket was either dark blue or white, according to climate. After 1911 the blue jacket included lapels in branch color (yellow for cavalry, red for artillery, light blue for infantry, and so on). The individual officer could wear full dress or either of the evening dress alternatives for social functions. In view of the expense involved, it was usually senior officers who appeared in mess or evening dress uniforms. While the blue full dress was worn from 1902 to 1917 by all ranks for ceremonial parades within the continental United States, the two optional evening uniforms were authorized only for officers.

The various blue uniforms ceased to be worn after 1917. However, the white mess uniform for commissioned and warrant officers was authorized again in 1921. In 1928, wearing of the full range of blue dress uniforms was authorized for all ranks, but only when off duty, and at the expense of the individual. In practice, this meant that only the pre-1917 mess uniform, and to a lesser extent the special evening wear, reappeared in significant numbers.

After World War II, the evening dress and mess dress uniforms were reintroduced, with the tail coat having a single Austrian knot (trefoil) over the branch-of-service color (general officers had stars over an oak leaf braid), with the rank placed in the bottom opening of the knot. The mess jacket, intended for black-tie occasions, used an Austrian knot rank system with the branch insignia at the bottom. The number of knots indicated the officer&#x27;s rank: five for colonel, four for lieutenant colonel, three for major, two for captain, one for first lieutenant, and none for second lieutenant. This complicated system, which required that the braid be altered with a change of rank, was replaced with the evening coat style in 1972, using a single knot and the rank placed above the branch-of-service color. A white mess jacket for summertime wear was introduced in the 1950s. The &quot;special evening dress&quot; (tails) was finally abolished in 1969, although officers already in possession of this uniform could continue to wear it until 1975. It was replaced by the Army blue mess uniform, which in its modern form closely resembles that of 1911. It is common for soldiers to wear suspenders in their branch color with the army dress uniform trousers, although they are concealed under the coat. The uniform has two variations, the Army blue mess uniform and Army blue evening mess uniform.

The Army blue mess uniform is considered equivalent to black tie, and consists of the mess jacket, trousers, white semiformal dress shirt with a turndown collar, black bow tie, and black cummerbund. The Army blue evening mess uniform is considered equivalent to white tie/tails, and consists of the same jacket and trousers, but with a white formal dress shirt with a wing collar, white single-breasted vest, and white bow tie.
Miniature medals are suspended on ribbons one half the width of their normal counterparts, and are worn on the left lapel. Exceptions to the miniature medals are the Medal of Honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (although the PMF also includes an optional miniature version), and authorized foreign neck-borne decorations (e.g., Knight Commander of Order of the Bath, Commander of the Order of Military Merit, &quot;et al.&quot;) Individual and unit awards that consist of ribbons only are not worn on the mess uniform. Miniature versions of combat and special skill badges are worn above the miniature medals, along with miniature versions of Ranger and Special Forces shoulder tabs, made of enameled metal. Marksmanship and driver/mechanic badges are not worn on the mess uniform. Regimental distinctive insignia is worn on the right lapel. Identification badges worn on service uniform pockets, such as the Drill Sergeant Identification Badge, Presidential Service Badge, Recruiter Badge, Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Identification Badge, &quot;et al.&quot;, are worn between the top and middle buttons on the applicable side of the mess uniform.

The lapels of enlisted mess uniforms are uniformly dark blue, rather than utilizing a branch color. Enlisted rank insignia is worn on the sleeve in the same manner as on the service uniform tunic. Below, on both sleeves, are long service stripes in place of the shorter stripes used on the service uniform. The same longer service stripes were worn on both sleeves of the blue dress uniform tunic until the blue dress uniform was reconfigured to be the Army&#x27;s service uniform and replace the green service uniform.

===U.S. Air Force===
In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. Air Force formal uniform consisted of a civilian black tailcoat with added military sleeve braid and rank insignia. It could be worn as either a black tie or white tie combination. Due to the tails, it was not considered a mess dress uniform.

The original U.S. Air Force mess dress consisted of a short black jacket with black trousers, with a white jacket for summer wear. The jackets had satin lapels with matching satin sleeve braid. It entered service in the 1960s and was phased out in the 1980s. It is still sometimes worn by retired officers. The current mess dress is similar in cut and tailoring, but in a dark blue color for year-round wear.

The current pattern was introduced in 1981 and is also similar to the Royal Air Force design, except that the coat and trousers are dark blue. Dark blue bow ties and dark blue cummerbunds are used for black-tie affairs, and white bow ties with white waistcoats for white-tie affairs. Silver-trimmed shoulder boards and silver sleeve braid are worn rather than rank braids (enlisted members wear sleeve rank insignia instead of shoulder boards, and no silver sleeve braid), along with silver buttons. No hat is worn. General officers have solid silver shoulder boards and wider silver sleeve braid. Enlisted members also have the option to wear the semi-formal uniform, essentially an issued service dress with a white shirt substituted for the blue shirt, but many non-commissioned officers elect to purchase a mess dress. Women&#x27;s mess dress uniforms have a long skirt replacing the trousers and delete the button chain clasp for the coat. As of August 2020, females have the option to wear mess dress trousers.

Members of the Civil Air Patrol, the United States Air Force Auxiliary, may wear the U.S. Air Force mess dress uniform with distinctive Civil Air Patrol insignia and trim. The Civil Air Patrol mess dress uniform is identical to the U.S. Air Force mess dress uniform, except that the silver braid on the jacket and officer rank insignia (shoulder boards) of the U.S. Air Force mess dress uniform is replaced with dark blue braid, and a Civil Air Patrol seal device 3&quot; in size (either embroidered in bullion or finished in enamel) is worn in place of the middle button on the right side of the jacket. Members of the Civil Air Patrol NCO corps wear distinctive Civil Air Patrol NCO rank insignia in lieu of U.S. Air Force NCO rank insignia.

Civil Air Patrol cadets do not wear the U.S. Air Force mess dress uniform, but may wear the semi-formal uniform described above for U.S. Air Force enlisted members, consisting of the U.S. Air Force service dress uniform with the name-tag removed and with Civil Air Patrol distinctive insignia, a white dress shirt, and a U.S. Air Force satin blue bow-tie.

Military courtesy and etiquette requirements for these Civil Air Patrol uniform combinations are similar to those of the U.S. Air Force.

===U.S. Marine Corps===

The United States Marine Corps mess dress uniforms date from the late 19th century. Mess dress-style uniforms in the USMC are reserved for officers, and staff noncommissioned officers (SNCOs) of grade E6 and above (staff sergeant to sergeant major/master gunnery sergeant); NCOs and junior enlisted members wear dress blues or Service &quot;A&quot; (also known as &quot;Alphas&quot;) as their most formal uniform.

The uniform coat of commissioned and warrant officers is fastened at the neck, similar to that of the dress blue uniform, but is cut away, &quot;cavalry-style&quot;, to expose the white dress shirt and scarlet cummerbund (general officers have a scarlet vest with small gold buttons). This version is known as evening dress &quot;B,&quot; and is equivalent to formal &quot;black tie&quot; civilian attire. It is worn to formal dances, balls, dinners, and events such as the annual USMC Birthday Ball. Officers (all ranks) may wear, in lieu of the scarlet cummerbund or vest, a white vest for white tie events (known as the evening dress &quot;A&quot; uniform, and equivalent to &quot;white tie&quot; civilian attire for the most formal occasions such as a State Dinner or Presidential Inauguration Ball).
Officer rank, in gold or silver wire, is embroidered directly on the shoulder epaulettes, which are bordered with gold wire and scarlet piping. The collar and cuffs are also bordered in gold wire and scarlet, bearing a quatrefoil for warrant officers and company-grade officers, a single row of oak leaves for field officers, and a double row of oak leaves for general officers. The uniform is completed with midnight blue trousers with gold and red stripes. The individual also has the option to wear the boat cloak of dark blue broadcloth material lined with scarlet wool (for male officers and SNCOs) or an optional dress cape of dark blue polyester-wool tropical material lined with scarlet satin rayon cloth (for female officers and SNCOs).

Staff noncommissioned officers wear a double-breasted evening dress uniform similar to that of navy officers, with high waist dress blue trousers with blood stripe, scarlet cummerbund, and black bow tie. The jacket is cut so as to have no overlap, but with the sides clasped together. The grade chevrons are in the style of the 1890s, larger than other USMC enlisted grade chevrons, worn on each sleeve of the jacket. A white cummerbund with a white bow tie is authorized (for white tie events) for SNCO&#x27;s.

A summer white mess dress (see link for pictures of the obsolete uniforms), similar in design to U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard uniforms, but with shoulder epaulettes instead of rank boards, was worn until the mid-1990s when it was phased out.

===U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, Merchant Marine and others===

Officers and chief petty officers of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, NOAA Corps, and Merchant Marine use the same mess uniform, referred to as &quot;dinner dress&quot;. There are three styles of this uniform—dinner dress, dinner dress jacket, and tropical dinner dress.

Dinner dress uniforms, blue and white, are modifications of service dress blue or service dress white uniforms, with the service ribbons and breast insignia replaced by miniature medals and miniature breast insignia. Additionally, officers and chief petty officers wear an evening shirt and black bow tie with dinner dress blue.

Dinner dress blue jacket and dinner dress white jacket consist of a black waist-length jacket with gold buttons (officer) or silver buttons (petty officer first class and below). The jacket is double-breasted, but does not overlap, and is held with a clasp. (This, in contrast to double-breasted civilian evening jackets, which are worn fully open, or double-breasted smoking jackets which are worn fully overlapped and buttoned). Bullion or imitation bullion rank stripes are worn on the sleeves of the officers&#x27; blue jacket, and a rating badge and service stripes are worn by enlisted personnel. On the officers&#x27; dinner dress white jacket, hard shoulder boards are worn. A gold cummerbund is worn by officers and chief petty officers, and a black one by petty officers first class and below. Shirt studs and cuff links are gold for officers and chiefs and silver for petty officers first class and below. A hat or cap is not required with dinner dress jacket uniforms, but may be worn. For both genders, it must be worn with an outer garment, which is traditionally the boat cloak for males and cape for females. Females do not need to remove headgear indoors when wearing the tiara. The boat cloak, tiara, and cape, all being optional items, are very rarely seen.

Tropical dinner dress blue incorporates dinner dress blue trousers, summer white (short sleeve) shirt, an appropriate cummerbund, and miniature medals and breast insignia.

An additional uniform, formal dress (white tie), is optional for all commissioned officers, but may be prescribed for captains and above. This uniform is worn as an equivalent to civilian white tie dress. It is almost identical to the dinner dress blue jacket, except a wing collar shirt, white waistcoat, and white tie are worn. A formal blue tailcoat may also be prescribed.

Members of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary wear the same dinner dress uniforms as the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, but with a silver cummerbund and silver Coast Guard Auxiliary officer insignia in place of the gold insignia. Petty officers and below may, at their option, wear this same uniform, but with a black cummerbund and silver buttons.

==International organizations==

Various international organizations and civilian groups also use a form of mess dress. Several national first aid organization under the St John Ambulance umbrella use mess uniforms as a part of the national uniform dress. Each mess uniform varies from nation to nation; however, it generally reflects the colours of St John, being Black, silver (white or grey) and red. The organization&#x27;s cut and style, as well as accoutrements generally follow British military style.

<text>A mess kit is a collection of silverware and cookware designed for use by military personnel for food and military rations. They may also be used during camping and backpacking. There are many varieties of mess kits that militaries issue to their personnel that later become available to consumers.

==Mess tin==

A mess tin is an item in a mess kit, designed to be used over portable cooking apparatus. A mess tin can be thought of as a portable version of a saucepan, intended primarily for boiling but also useful for frying. Mess tins were originally a military design, but are also popular among civilian campers.

Mess tins are generally rectangular with rounded off edges - the rounded edges are easier to clean inside than a sharp corner. Most mess tins are supplied as a set, with one slightly larger than the other, allowing them to nestle together for easy packing. This arrangement is also useful when using the tins for boiling, as the smaller tin can be used to hold the liquid, with the larger tin placed on top to act as a lid. In order to save weight, some designs stick with a single mess tin with a lid, with the lid often having a secondary role as a frying pan.

==Military==
While functionally similar to a one-man civilian mess kit, military mess kits are designed to be even more compact, using their space as efficiently as possible. Thus lids will almost always be used for preparing, cooking, and/or eating, and usually come in two or three pieces. As such, it may sacrifice certain features, or use other features to complement it.

When in a large camp, it is common for soldiers to use either normal dining ware, or a multi-compartment mess tray similar to a TV dinner tray, but much larger.

===United States===
Prior to World War II, two factors influenced the design of the US Army&#x27;s M-1926, M-1932, and M-1942 mess kits. First, unlike most other armies of the day, the US mess kit was designed to serve men queuing in feeding lines and served in unit formations from large garrison-type field kitchens when not on daily combat operations. Secondly, US soldiers in the field were never expected to forage or to completely cook their rations, even in daily combat or front line service. Instead, when not used as a serving tray for company-size or larger units, the mess kit was used to re-heat pre-measured servings of the canned Reserve Ration. After 1938, it was used for the new C-ration, a canned combat ration with several menu precooked or dried food items. Today, though canned and dried combat rations have further evolved into the MRE, these can now be self-heated, and thus only a containment tray is required for most units.

The US Army&#x27;s flat ovoid M-1932 wartime-issue mess kit was made of galvanized steel (stainless steel in the later M-1942), and was a divided pan-and-body system. When opened, the mess kit consisted of two halves: the deeper half forms a shallow, flat-bottom, ovoid &quot;Meat can, body&quot;, designed to receive the &quot;meat ration&quot;, the meat portion of the pre-war canned &quot;Reserve Ration&quot;. The &quot;Meat can, body&quot;, with its folding handle extended, can double as a crude skillet. The &quot;Mess kit, plate&quot; (lid) is even shallower, and is pressed to form two compartments, with a center divide wide enough to accommodate the folding handle. The plate also has a very secure ring that is held in place by friction.

When stored, the &quot;Mess kit, plate&quot; is placed on top of the ovoid &quot;Meat can, body&quot;, while the stamped folding handle is folded over the inverse side of the plate&#x27;s center divider, and latched onto the edge of the body. It is further secured folding the lid&#x27;s ring toward the center of the mess kit, which locks onto another latch. In use, each piece may be used individually, or as a unitary three-compartment mess tray, accomplished by sliding the lid-plate&#x27;s center divider onto the folding handle, and securing it to the handle by the ring-and-latch mechanisms. When latched, the kit can be held in a ready position by the user in one hand to receive US Army&#x27;s &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;B&#x27; field kitchen rations. As the soldier passed along the mess line, food service personnel would dole out hot items first, often meat followed by vegetables, potatoes, and other side dishes, ostensibly separated by the tray dividers. While a soldier could use the handled &quot;Meat can, body&quot; from his kit to cook raw food, it is really too shallow and thin to serve as an effective skillet, and was usually restricted to heating the canned meat ration. After 1938, the &quot;Meat can, body&quot; was used to heat the meat and vegetable component of the C-ration, or to reconstitute breakfast items such as C-ration powdered eggs.

To complement the mess kit, soldiers used a stamped cup especially molded to fit over the bottom of the US Army&#x27;s standard one-quart (950 ml) canteen. This cup could be used to boil water for coffee, or for heating or reconstituting soup or other foods. During World War II, units preparing heated combat rations in the &quot;Meat can, body&quot; or canteen cup mainly used locally procured combustible materials or Sterno fuel units of jellied alcohol. The latter could be stored within an issued folding stove for deployment when heating food, soup, or coffee in the field.

After World War II, a specially-designed Esbit stove was issued to fit over the cup-and-canteen unit, similar to designs used in other armies.

During World War II, the German and Japanese Imperial Army used mess kits that were similar in several ways. In storage, their dimensions were similar to US mess kits, but were split widthwise instead of lengthwise, around two-thirds of the body, creating a pot with handle and a cup.

The German mess kit (&quot;Essgeschirr&quot;) was designed in 1908, a modification of a Swiss design from 1882. Originally, the base held two litres, marked into 1/4 sections, and the lid holding another 1/4. This model replaced the 1850 &quot;Kochgeschirr&quot;. The new 1908 &quot;Essgeschirr&quot; was made of aluminium and not designed for cooking; only to contain food distributed from field kitchens. The early models of the 1908 were painted in a distinct matte black.
In 1910, the aluminum handle was replaced with one of galvanised iron, as aluminum often got hot in the soldiers&#x27; hands. The 1908 model was in production until 1940. In 1931, a model later called &quot;Kochgeschirr 31&quot; (Cooking pot model 31) was developed. It was capable of cooking, and held 1.7 liters. With only very minor changes, this model remained in service with the German military (both East and West) as well as with the German disaster relief services (THW), which were painted grey.

They were mainly used in conjunction with a folding Esbit stove, which, when folded, could store Esbit pellets and occupy a very small area. The German mess kit was usually held together with a leather strap, which was used to fasten the mess kit to the soldier&#x27;s bread bag in combat order or assault pack of the webbing equipment in marching order.

The Japanese Army enlisted men&#x27;s mess kit, or (&quot;rice container&quot;), differed from other armies&#x27; mess kits in several respects. No attempt was made to conform the &quot;hangō&quot; to the Japanese one-liter M-94 oval water bottle, which was larger than that issued to the armies of some other nations. The &quot;hangō&quot; consisted of a brown kidney-shaped, oval-bottomed, heavy-gauge aluminum rice cooker pot with lid, and an insert tray stored inside the pot. The lid and tray were also used as serving plates. A simplified model, the &quot;Ro&quot;, was introduced later in the war, which lacked the pot insert.

The men cooked with &quot;hangō&quot;s over open fires or cans of jellied alcohol. In addition to its usefulness as a cooking vessel, the &quot;hangō&quot; was useful for carrying the cooked rice. During the Second World War, it was occasionally adopted by members of the United States Army and Chinese Army which had captured Japanese equipment, and later by the Viet Minh.

===Finnish===
The Finnish Defence Forces mess kit (&quot;kenttäkeittoastia&quot; or &quot;kenttäpakki&quot;) is almost identical to the &quot;German M31 mess kit design&quot;, but, unlike the latter, a &quot;lusikkahaarukka&quot; (a type of folding spoon-fork utensil) is included with a Finnish mess kit instead of a separate fork and spoon set. A lusikkahaarukka therefore cannot be stored inside a Finnish mess tin as it would cause excessive noise in the mess tin.

===Soviet/Russian===
During the Second World War the Soviet Army mess kit was a two-piece design similar to that used by the Wehrmacht forces that consisted of a large main canteen part, and a smaller saucepan component that also doubled as the mess tin lid. The kit also had a wire handle which many soldiers used to hang the mess kit from their web equipment or backpack. This design was supplemented in the mid-1980s with a second design that featured a metal water bottle held in the middle. The next layer of the set was a large canteen/cooking pot with a wire handle, then a smaller saucepan-type component with a folding metal handle. This last component fitted over the base of the larger cooking pot, the handle was then folded up and clipped over the cooking pot and the lip of the water bottle. This variant was often called &quot;VDV type&quot;. The mess set was sometimes issued with a pouch, although this was by no means certain and many soldiers simply hung it onto their equipment from the wire handle. Officers were often issued a satchel-type bag for their mess kits in keeping with their smart image. This latest design of mess kit continues to be used today in the armies of many former Soviet republics, but in recent years the military of the Russian Federation has stopped issuing mess kits to soldiers due to the lack of adequate supply owing to the size of newly formed combat units, lack of adequate domestic production, poor storage of existing units and the sale of Soviet-era stockpiles to civilians and third-party buyers.

===Swedish===
The Swedish Armed Forces &quot;Kokkärl m/1940&quot; mess kit is a complete package, similar in design to a German mess kit, but larger and oval-shaped. It breaks down into two parts, the first part being a steel stand/windshield/wood-burning stove (with a Svea alcohol burner unit), whilst the other part consists of two pots (usually aluminium). The larger pot has a wire handle, or bail, for suspending over a fire; the smaller has hinged handle. The two pots nest together and stow inside the windshield. The set is completed by a small plastic fuel bottle. It is recommended that the fuel bottle and burner unit be stored separately, outside the pots (since alcohol may otherwise seep out). A Swedish army plastic mug can also be fitted inside the pots.

The stove uses small sticks, wood chips, or pine cones as fuel. When using the alcohol burner, the Svea burner unit may advantageously be replaced with a Trangia replacement burner, which appears to be more efficient. 

===Swiss===
The Swiss mess kit (French &quot;&quot;) was originally introduced in 1875. This &quot;Runde Gamelle 1875&quot; was a pot made of tin-plated sheet steel with a lid and handle. It was however later deemed unsuitable and so in 1882 a revised design &quot;Einzelkochgeschirr Ord. 1882&quot; was introduced. This model is a canteen-cup system: a tall, one liter canteen, and a lid; the lid serves as a cup which can be fit inside the canteen, better heating its contents. The 1882 design later formed the basis of the modern &quot;German mess kit design&quot; as mentioned above. All models since 1882 were officially designated &quot;Einzelkochgeschirr&quot;, but soldiers kept calling them &quot;gamelle&quot;.

===British===
====1908 Pattern Mess Tin====
In the First World War, the British Army used a metal, two-piece, kidney shaped mess tin.

The 1874-model was made of tinplated steel and had a &quot;D&quot; plan view with rounded corners. The tray or cup piece had a folding handle that opened to the side. The tray also functioned as a deep lid for the pan. This change from the 1854-model allowed the use of the narrow and tighter curved side of the cup rim for drinking. It also permitted the tray to briefly be held over a fire. The corners of the square shaped bail were also more rounded.
The geometry of the older British mess tins was substantially different. The 1854-model was D-shaped in plan view and was made of tinplated iron. It was fabricated from front and back panels of sheet metal. The tray or cup nested inside the pan. The handle of the tray or cup folded inside but was on the flat &quot;back side&quot; forcing the user to drink from the broadly curved front. The lid was intermediate in depth, could be used as a plate, and set down securely on the pan. The bail was square shaped and the corners were tight curves.
The 1810 (181314)-model is semicircular or C-shaped in plan view and is made of tinplated iron. The tray of the 1810-model had no handle but nested inside the pan or lower section. The lid covered the pan and had a pull ring for easy removal, but apparently had no other intended use. The bail was curved.

====1937 Pattern Mess Tin====
A new pattern of mess tin was developed for the Web Equipment 1937 Pattern, which was a nested, two-piece rectangular mess tin with long, folding handles. An enamelled tin mug was used for drinking hot liquids. The water bottle of the 1908 Pattern Web Equipment was unchanged, though the web carrier was changed to incorporate the 1-inch-wide brace ends of the 1937 gear.

====Contemporary====
The British Armed Forces generally use mess tins for cooking in the field, although with the British Armed Forces primarily using Boil in the Bag rations, many soldiers prefer a single large metal mug, as one item can be used to cook food and to make and consume hot drinks, thereby cutting down on equipment weight. As such cups fit beneath the standard water bottle, they also take up less space in the soldiers&#x27; equipment. The mess tin or cup is usually used with the standard issue FireDragon folding burner &amp; fuel.

===Canadian===
====Historical====
Canadian mess equipment was similar to that used by the British in the first half of the 20th century, i.e., that issued with 1908 and 1937 Pattern Web Equipment. Canada issued its own 1951 Pattern Web Equipment, 1964 Pattern Web Equipment, and 1982 Pattern Web Equipment.

====Contemporary====
The use of aluminium in mess equipment has been identified as a health hazard, and plastics and disposables have become more common. In particular, the use of Individual Meal Packs (IMP) have become common, with chemical cooking bags. Messing from hayboxes/fresh rations in the field is often accomplished with disposable mess gear (i.e. paper plates).

==Camping==
A civilian mess kit, which may serve from one person to a family of eight, is a collection of common kitchen wares designed to be lightweight and easy to store. Such kits are typically constructed from aluminium, though enameled steel is also common, and some items (such as cutlery or plates) may be made of more expensive materials, such as titanium, to further save weight, or of plastic. A civilian mess kit usually contains at least a skillet, a kettle (which may also serve as a coffee pot), a plate, a cup (typically a Sierra cup), and cutlery. Utensils usually consist of forks, knives, and spoons, as at home, but may be replaced by specialty items like sporks or folding chopsticks. Kits usually come with either folding handles or a detachable handle which can be used with other cookware. Items are stored compactly by nesting them in other components; the whole kit may be placed in a stuff sack.

<doc id="1086183" wikidata="Q918285" url="?curid=1086183" title="Adrenocortical carcinoma">
<text>Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive cancer originating in the cortex (steroid hormone-producing tissue) of the adrenal gland.

Adrenocortical carcinoma is remarkable for the many hormonal syndromes that can occur in patients with steroid hormone-producing (&quot;functional&quot;) tumors, including Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, Conn syndrome, virilization, and feminization. Adrenocortical carcinoma has often invaded nearby tissues or metastasized to distant organs at the time of diagnosis, and the overall 5-year survival rate is about 50%.

Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare tumor, with incidence of one to two per million population annually. It has a bimodal distribution by age, with cases clustering in children under 5 and in adults 30–40 years old. The widely used angiotensin-II-responsive steroid-producing cell line H295R was originally isolated from a tumor diagnosed as adrenocortical carcinoma.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Adrenocortical carcinoma may present differently in children and adults. Most tumors in children are functional, and virilization is by far the most common presenting symptom(s), followed by Cushing&#x27;s syndrome and precocious puberty. Among adults presenting with hormonal syndromes, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome alone is most common, followed by mixed Cushing&#x27;s and virilization (glucocorticoid and androgen overproduction). Feminization and Conn syndrome (mineralocorticoid excess) occur in less than 10% of cases. Rarely, pheochromocytoma-like hypersecretion of catecholamines has been reported in adrenocortical cancers. Nonfunctional tumors (about 40%, authorities vary) usually present with abdominal or flank pain, varicocele, and renal vein thrombosis or they may be asymptomatic and detected incidentally.

All patients with suspected ACC should be carefully evaluated for signs and symptoms of hormonal syndromes. For Cushing&#x27;s syndrome (glucocorticoid excess), these include weight gain, muscle wasting, purple lines on the abdomen, a fatty &quot;buffalo hump&quot; on the neck, a &quot;moon-like&quot; face, and thinning, fragile skin. Virilism (androgen excess) is most obvious in women, and may produce excess facial and body hair, acne, enlargement of the clitoris, deepening of the voice, coarsening of facial features, cessation of menstruation. Conn syndrome (mineralcorticoid excess) is marked by high blood pressure, which can result in headache and hypokalemia (low serum potassium, which can in turn produce muscle weakness, confusion, and palpitations), low plasma renin activity, and high serum aldosterone. Feminization (estrogen excess) is most readily noted in men, and includes breast enlargement, decreased libido, and impotence.

==Pathophysiology==
The main etiologic factor of ACC is unknown, although families with Li–Fraumeni syndrome, caused by an inherited inactivation mutation in &quot;TP53&quot;, have increased risk. Several genes have been shown to be recurrently mutated, including &quot;TP53&quot;, &quot;CTNNB1&quot;, &quot;MEN1&quot;, &quot;PRKAR1A&quot;, &quot;RPL22&quot;, and &quot;DAXX&quot;. The telomerase gene &quot;TERT&quot; is often amplified while &quot;ZNRF3&quot; and &quot;CDKN2A&quot; are often homozygously deleted. The genes &quot;h19&quot;, insulin-like growth factor II (&quot;IGF-II&quot;), and &quot;p57kip2&quot; are important for fetal growth and development. They are located on chromosome 11p. Expression of the &quot;h19&quot; gene is markedly reduced in both nonfunctioning and functioning adrenal cortical carcinomas, especially in tumors producing cortisol and aldosterone. Also, a loss occurs of activity of the &quot;p57&quot; gene product in virilizing adenomas and adrenal cortical carcinomas. In contrast, &quot;IGF-II &quot;gene expression has been shown to be high in adrenal cortical carcinomas. Finally,&quot; c-myc &quot;gene expression is relatively high in neoplasms, and it is often linked to poor prognosis.

Bilateral adrenocortical tumors are less common than unilateral. The majority of bilateral tumours can be distinguished according to size and aspect of the nodules: primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, which can be sporadic or part of Carney complex, and primary bilateral macro nodular adrenal hyperplasia.Metastasis is most commonly to the liver and lung.

==Diagnosis==

===Laboratory findings===
Hormonal syndromes should be confirmed with laboratory testing. Laboratory findings in Cushing syndrome include increased serum glucose (blood sugar) and increased urine cortisol. Adrenal virilism is confirmed by the finding of an excess of serum androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone. Findings in Conn syndrome include low serum potassium, low plasma renin activity, and high serum aldosterone. Feminization is confirmed with the finding of excess serum estrogen.

===Imaging===
Radiological studies of the abdomen, such as CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging are useful for identifying the site of the tumor, differentiating it from other diseases, such as adrenocortical adenoma, and determining the extent of invasion of the tumor into surrounding organs and tissues. On CT, it shows heterogeneous appearance due to necrosis, calcifications, and haemorrhage. After contrast injection, it shows peripheral enhancement. Invasion of adjacent structures such as kidney, vena cava, liver, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are also common.

On MRI, it shows low intensity on T1-weighted images, and high T2 signal with strong heterogeneous contrast enhancement and slow washout. Haemorrhagic areas may show high T1-signal.

===Pathology===
Adrenal tumors are often not biopsied prior to surgery, so diagnosis is confirmed on examination of the surgical specimen by a pathologist. Grossly, ACCs are often large, with a tan-yellow cut surface, and areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. On microscopic examination, the tumor usually displays sheets of atypical cells with some resemblance to the cells of the normal adrenal cortex. The presence of invasion and mitotic activity help differentiate small cancers from adrenocortical adenomas.
Several relatively rare variants of ACC include:
* Oncocytic adrenal cortical carcinoma
* Myxoid adrenal cortical carcinoma
* Carcinosarcoma
* Adenosquamous adrenocortical carcinoma
* Clear cell adrenal cortical carcinoma

===Differential diagnosis===

Differential diagnosis includes: 
* Adrenocortical adenoma
* Renal cell carcinoma
* Pheochromocytoma
* Hepatocellular carcinoma

Adrenocortical carcinomas are most commonly distinguished from adrenocortical adenomas (their benign counterparts) by the Weiss system, as follows:

Total score indicates:
* 0-2: Adrenocortical adenoma
* 3: Undetermined
* 4-9: Adrenocortical carcinoma

==Treatment==
The only curative treatment is complete surgical excision of the tumor, which can be performed even in the case of invasion into large blood vessels, such as the renal vein or inferior vena cava. The 5-year survival rate after successful surgery is 50–60%, but unfortunately, many patients are not surgical candidates. A 2018 systematic review suggests that laparoscopic retroperotenial adrenalectomy appears to reduce late morbidity, time to oral fluid or food intake and time to ambulation when compared to laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy, however there is uncertainty about these effects due to very low-quality evidence. For outcomes such as all-cause mortality, early morbidity, socioeconomic effects, and operative and postoperative parameter, the evidence is uncertain about the effects of either interventions over the other.

Radiation therapy and radiofrequency ablation may be used for palliation in patients who are not surgical candidates. Minimally invasive surgical techniques remain controversial due to the absence of long-term data, with a particular concern for rates of recurrence and peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Chemotherapy regimens typically include the drug mitotane, an inhibitor of steroid synthesis, which is toxic to cells of the adrenal cortex, as well as standard cytotoxic drugs. A retrospective analysis showed a survival benefit for mitotane in addition to surgery when compared to surgery alone.

The two most common regimens are cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide (EDP) + mitotane, and streptozotocin + mitotane. The FIRM-ACT trial demonstrated higher rates of response and longer progression-free survival with EDP + mitotane than with streptozotocin + mitotane.

==Prognosis==
ACC, generally, carries a poor prognosis, with an overall 5-year survival rate of about 50%. Five-year disease-free survival for a complete resection of a stage I–III ACC is about 30%. The most important prognostic factors are age of the patient and stage of the tumor. Poor prognostic factors include mitotic activity, venous invasion, weight of 50 g or more, diameter of 6.5 cm or more, Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index of 4% or more, and p53 positive.

In its malignancy, adrenocortical carcinoma is unlike most tumours of the adrenal cortex, which are benign (adenomas) and only occasionally cause Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.

<doc id="1086213" wikidata="Q252230" url="?curid=1086213" title="Ram (album)">
<text>Ram (also stylised as &quot;RAM&quot;) is the only studio album credited to the husband-and-wife music duo Paul and Linda McCartney, and the former&#x27;s second album post-Beatles. Released on 17 May 1971 by Apple Records, it was recorded in New York with guitarists David Spinozza and Hugh McCracken, and future Wings drummer Denny Seiwell. Three singles were issued from the album: &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot; (McCartney&#x27;s first number 1 hit in America without the Beatles), &quot;The Back Seat of My Car&quot; and &quot;Eat at Home&quot;. The recording sessions also yielded the non-album single &quot;Another Day&quot;.

The album&#x27;s release coincided with a period of acrimony between McCartney and his former Beatle bandmates, and followed his legal action in the United Kingdom&#x27;s High Court to dissolve the Beatles partnership. John Lennon perceived slights in the lyrics to songs such as &quot;Too Many People&quot;, to which he responded with his song &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;. Although McCartney felt that he had addressed the criticisms he received with his 1970 solo debut, &quot;McCartney&quot;, &quot;Ram&quot; elicited a similarly unfavourable reaction from music journalists. It nonetheless topped the national album charts in the UK, the Netherlands and Canada. Today, &quot;Ram&quot; is held in high regard by many music critics and is often ranked as one of McCartney&#x27;s best albums. It has also been recognised as an early indie pop album.

In 1971, McCartney produced &quot;Thrillington&quot;, an instrumental interpretation of &quot;Ram&quot; that was released in 1977 under the pseudonym Percy &#x27;Thrills&#x27; Thrillington. In 2012, an expanded edition of &quot;Ram&quot; was reissued (&quot;Thrillington&quot; included) with over two dozen bonus tracks as part of the &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Ram&quot; was ranked number 450 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the greatest albums of all time.

==Background==
Paul McCartney and his family flew to New York City in October 1970 to begin working on the follow-up to &quot;McCartney&quot;. While the previous album had featured him playing every instrument, for &quot;Ram&quot;, McCartney decided to hold auditions for musicians, some of whom were brought in under the guise of recording a commercial jingle. Auditions were held in an attic on 45th Street for three days, where David Spinozza was recruited as guitarist by Linda, before auditions moved to a Bronx basement, where Denny Seiwell was brought in to play drums. McCartney once said he found Seiwell &quot;lying on a mattress&quot; in the basement. Midway through these sessions, Spinozza became unavailable and was replaced by Hugh McCracken.

==Songs and production==
The basic tracks for the album were taped at Columbia&#x27;s Studio B from 12 October to 19 November 1970, with additional vocal sessions between 6–11 December at Columbia&#x27;s Studio D, before the McCartneys returned to their Scottish farm for the Christmas holidays. Work continued at A&amp;R Recording Studios, New York, from the second week of January 1971 through to February. Playing guitar or piano and singing at the same time, Paul chose to overdub his bass later on. Although it was a collaborative project, Linda&#x27;s vocal duties were mostly limited to singing harmonies and backing Paul, who sang almost all of the lead parts. Linda sang co-lead on &quot;Long Haired Lady&quot;. The McCartneys&#x27; daughter Heather, who had been adopted by Paul the previous year, sang backing vocals on &quot;Monkberry Moon Delight&quot;.

&quot;Ram On&quot;, from the album&#x27;s first side, is reprised on the second side, before the album&#x27;s final track, &quot;The Back Seat of My Car&quot;. A group of New York-based freelancers including past and present members of the New York Philharmonic was brought in by McCartney to play on &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot;, &quot;Long Haired Lady&quot; and &quot;The Back Seat of My Car&quot;, as well as the McCartneys&#x27; song &quot;Another Day&quot;, with arrangements by George Martin. &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot; is in a similar vein to the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; medley, as the song consisted of several unfinished songs combined into one. Music videos were made for &quot;3 Legs&quot; and &quot;Heart of the Country&quot;, from footage that was filmed at High Park, Campbeltown on 5–6 June 1971, and edited together by Roy Benson.

The project moved to Sound Recording in Los Angeles, where much of the backing vocals were recorded. Producer Jim Guercio cancelled his honeymoon to oversee the project, but his direction was not followed by McCartney, and progress stalled. McCartney was unable to choose which of the 20+ recorded songs would be cut from the album. Guercio left the project to honour a previous booking, and Norwegian engineer Eirik Wangberg replaced him, finishing the album over the course of six weeks. McCartney gave Wangberg free rein to mix the songs as he saw fit, and sequence them for the album in any way he chose. Among the creative decisions made by Wangberg was the stitching together of two songs to make &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot;, and the introduction of thunder sound effects to that song; the thunder was taken from a monaural film clip, recorded by Wangberg onto two tracks with small differences to make artificial stereo. Paul and Linda were very happy upon hearing the final album mix.

The recording project also yielded the independent single &quot;Another Day&quot; and its B-side, &quot;Oh Woman, Oh Why&quot;, released in mid-February 1971. Session songs dropped from the album sequence included &quot;Little Woman Love&quot; and tracks later featured on Wings&#x27; 1973 album &quot;Red Rose Speedway&quot;: &quot;Get on the Right Thing&quot;, &quot;Little Lamb Dragonfly&quot; and &quot;Big Barn Bed&quot;. &quot;I Lie Around&quot;, issued as the B-side to Wings&#x27; 1973 single &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, was taped during these sessions. Also recorded was the first incarnation of &quot;Seaside Woman&quot;. McCartney also recorded &quot;Hey Diddle&quot;, &quot;A Love for You&quot;, &quot;Great Cock and Seagull Race&quot;, &quot;Now Hear This Song of Mine&quot;, &quot;Rode All Night&quot;, &quot;Sunshine Sometimes&quot; and &quot;When the Wind Is Blowing&quot;.

===References to the Beatles and others===
According to Peter Brown, the Beatles&#x27; former business associate, John Lennon believed that several of the songs on &quot;Ram&quot; contained personal jibes directed at himself and Yoko Ono, among them &quot;Dear Boy&quot; and, particularly, &quot;Too Many People&quot;. McCartney later conceded that some of the lyrics of &quot;Too Many People&quot; had been &quot;a little dig at John and Yoko&quot;, with &quot;preaching practices&quot; and &quot;you took your lucky break and broke it in two&quot; being direct references to Lennon. However, he claimed &quot;Dear Boy&quot; was directed at Linda&#x27;s ex-husband, and not Lennon. Brown also described the picture of two beetles copulating on the back cover as symbolic of how McCartney felt the other Beatles were treating him. George Harrison and Ringo Starr were said to interpret the track &quot;3 Legs&quot; as an attack on them and Lennon.

==Release==
&quot;Another Day&quot; / &quot;Oh Woman, Oh Why&quot; was released that February and became a worldwide Top 5 hit. In May, &quot;Ram&quot; was unveiled, on the 17th in the US and on the 21st in the UK. &quot;The Back Seat of My Car&quot; was excerpted as a UK single that August, only reaching number 39, but the US release of the ambitious &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot; proved much more successful, giving McCartney his first number 1 single since leaving the Beatles. The album reached number 1 in the UK and number 2 in the US, where it spent over five months in the Top 10 and went platinum. Despite the phasing-out of monaural albums by the late 1960s, &quot;Ram&quot; was pressed in mono with unique mixes that differ from the common stereo version. These were only made available to radio stations and are among the most valuable and sought-after of Paul McCartney&#x27;s solo records. The album has sold over 3 million copies.

In July, Northern Songs and Maclen Music sued Paul and Linda McCartney for violating an exclusive rights agreement by collaborating on &quot;Another Day&quot;. Although six of the eleven songs on &quot;Ram&quot; were also co-written with Linda, both parties agreed the issue of royalties for the album could be decided at a later date. In June 1972, Associated Television (ATV), which then owned Northern Songs, announced that &quot;all differences between them have been amicably settled&quot; and the McCartneys signed a new seven-year co-publishing contract between ATV and McCartney Music.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, &quot;Ram&quot; was poorly received by music critics. McCartney was particularly hurt by the harsh reviews − especially as he had attempted to address the points raised in criticism of his earlier album, &quot;McCartney&quot;, by adopting a more professional approach this time around. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jon Landau called &quot;Ram&quot; &quot;incredibly inconsequential&quot; and &quot;monumentally irrelevant&quot;, and criticised its lack of intensity and energy. He added that it exposes McCartney as having &quot;benefited immensely from collaboration&quot; with the Beatles, particularly John Lennon, who &quot;held the reins in on McCartney&#x27;s cutsie-pie, florid attempts at pure rock muzak&quot; and kept him from &quot;going off the deep end that leads to an album as emotionally vacuous as &quot;Ram&quot;&quot;. &quot;Playboy&quot; accused McCartney of &quot;substituting facility for any real substance&quot;, and compared it to &quot;watching someone juggle five guitars: It&#x27;s fairly impressive, but you keep wondering why he bothers.&quot; In &quot;NME&quot;, Alan Smith further called it &quot;an excursion into almost unrelieved tedium&quot; and &quot;the worst thing Paul McCartney has ever done&quot;. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, called it &quot;a bad record, a classic form/content mismatch&quot;, but Paul Levinson countered in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that the mismatch was &quot;in the wires and components of Christgau&#x27;s stereo&quot;. Christgau further felt that McCartney succumbed to &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; by overworking himself and obscenely producing a style of music meant to be soft and whimsical. In a slightly more positive note, Chris Charlesworth of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; found &quot;Ram&quot; an overall better record than &quot;McCartney&quot;, but still found it subpar to the recent releases of Harrison and Lennon. Charlesworth concluded: &quot;A good album by anybody&#x27;s standards and certainly far better than the majority released by British groups and singers. Trouble is you expect too much from a man like Paul McCartney.&quot; Writing four years later, Roy Carr and Tony Tyler from &quot;NME&quot; suggested that &quot;it would be naive to have expected the McCartneys to produce anything other than a mediocre record ... Grisly though this was, McCartney was to sink lower before rescuing his credibility late in 1973.&quot;

McCartney&#x27;s fellow ex-Beatles, all of whom were riding high in critical favour with their recent releases, were likewise vocal in their negativity. Lennon hated the album, dismissing his former songwriting partner&#x27;s efforts as &quot;muzak to my ears&quot; in his song &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; Starr told the UK&#x27;s &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;I feel sad about Paul&#x27;s albums ... I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s one [good] tune on the last one, &quot;Ram&quot; ... he seems to be going strange.&quot; In addition to conducting a war of words in the British music press, &quot;Crippled Inside&quot;, another track on Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; album, was also thought to be directed at McCartney. Early editions of &quot;Imagine&quot; included a postcard of Lennon pulling the ears of a pig in a parody of &quot;Ram&quot;″s cover photograph of McCartney holding a ram by the horns.

===Retrospect===

The 2012 reissue of &quot;Ram&quot; received an aggregate score of 86 out of 100 from Metacritic, based on twelve reviews – a score that the website defines as indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Reviewing this issue, &quot;Mojo&quot; said that &quot;today it sounds quintessentially McCartney&quot;. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;in retrospect it looks like nothing so much as the first indie pop album, a record that celebrates small pleasures with big melodies.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Jayson Greene similarly felt McCartney was &quot;inventing an approach to pop music that would eventually become someone else&#x27;s indie pop&quot;, and called &quot;Ram&quot; &quot;a domestic-bliss album, one of the weirdest, earthiest, and most honest ever made&quot;. Simon Vozick-Levinson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dubbed it a &quot;daffy masterpiece&quot; and &quot;a grand psychedelic ramble full of divine melodies and orchestral frippery&quot;.

David Quantick of &quot;Uncut&quot; felt that, although it is not as &quot;legendary&quot; as publicised, the album is &quot;occasionally brilliant and historically fascinating&quot; as &quot;post-Beatles mish-mash&quot;. Steven Hyden, writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, said that the &quot;lightweight&quot; style that was originally panned by critics is &quot;actually (when heard with sympathetic ears) a big part of what makes it so appealing.&quot; However, &quot;Q&quot; magazine still found &quot;Ram&quot; to be &quot;frustratingly uneven&quot;. In a retrospective review in 1981, Robert Christgau panned McCartney&#x27;s songs as pretentious &quot;crotchets ... so lightweight they float away even as Paulie layers them down with caprices.&quot;

==Reissues==
In 1977, McCartney supervised the release of an instrumental interpretation of &quot;Ram&quot; (recorded in June 1971 and arranged by Richard Hewson) with the release of &quot;Thrillington&quot; under the pseudonym of Percy &quot;Thrills&quot; Thrillington. &quot;Thrillington&quot; was later released as part of the 2012 super-deluxe release of &quot;Ram&quot;.

&quot;Ram&quot;, along with McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Wings over America&quot; and &quot;Tug of War&quot; albums, was issued in the US on compact disc on 18 January 1988. In 1993, the album was remastered and reissued on CD as part of &quot;The Paul McCartney Collection&quot; series with &quot;Another Day&quot; and &quot;Oh Woman, Oh Why&quot; as bonus tracks. That same year Digital Compact Classics released an audiophile edition prepared by Steve Hoffman.
On 21 May 2012 (in the UK) and 22 May (in the US), the album was reissued by McCartney&#x27;s current label, Hear Music as part of the &quot;Paul McCartney Archive Collection&quot;. This reissue included the mono mix, which had never been issued previously on compact disc, except by bootleggers. The mono version was also released commercially in 2012, albeit as a limited edition LP. The 2012 reissue was accompanied by a Record Store Day-exclusive edition of the &quot;Another Day&quot; single.

==Tributes==
In 2009, two tribute albums featuring all of the songs from the album were put together:
* &quot;Ram On L.A&quot; was compiled by the website &quot;Aquarium Drunkard&quot; and released as a digital download, featuring Los Angeles-based acts.
* &quot;Tom: A Best Show on WFMU Tribute to Ram&quot; was put together by WFMU DJ Tom Scharpling for the New Jersey radio station&#x27;s annual fundraising marathon as a CD made available exclusively to those who donated to his show. Artists included Aimee Mann, Death Cab for Cutie and Ted Leo, among others.

In 2012, Danish rock singer/songwriter Tim Christensen, American singer/songwriters Mike Viola and Tracy Bonham, and Christensen&#x27;s solo band the Damn Crystals did a one-off tribute show, performing &quot;Ram&quot; in full, along with other McCartney post-Beatles songs, at Vega in Copenhagen, in celebration of McCartney&#x27;s 70th birthday. In 2013, this tribute concert was released as the DVD/CD and DVD/2-LP album &quot;Pure McCartney&quot;.

In 2021, Denny Seiwell teamed up with Fernando Perdomo to produce &quot;Ram On: The 50th Anniversary Tribute to Paul and Linda McCartney&#x27;s Ram&quot;. The album has over 100 musicians from all over the world creating a new version of &quot;Ram&quot; and the single tracks &quot;Another Day&quot; and &quot;Oh Woman, Oh Why&quot;. The contributors included Seiwell, Spinozza, and Marvin Stamm from the original sessions, along with Davey Johnstone, Will Lee, Joey Santiago of the Pixies, Eric Dover formerly of Jellyfish, and Carnie Wilson. Cherry Red Records released the album on May 17, 2021.

<doc id="1086222" wikidata="Q7714193" url="?curid=1086222" title="The Architect (2006 film)">
<text>The Architect is a 2006 American drama film directed by Matt Tauber. Based on the 1996 play by David Greig, the plot is about architect Leo Waters (Anthony LaPaglia), who is confronted by angry residents of a housing complex he designed. The buildings have created a culture of crime in the neighborhood and the residents want them pulled down. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2006, and received a limited release in the United States on December 1, 2006.

==Plot==
Leo Waters is a successful architect, who also teaches architecture at a local university. He has a strained relationship with his family, including his wife Julia, a housewife who spends her time tending to their luxurious modern house, their son Martin, who recently dropped out of college and has no interest to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and become an architect, and their daughter Christina, whom he watches inappropriately at times.

Tonya Neely is a cleaning lady who lives in a state-funded high-rise public housing project Leo designed several years ago in Chicago&#x27;s South Side. Her son committed suicide and her eldest daughter is a young single mom. Meanwhile, Cammie, her youngest daughter attends a prestigious school on a scholarship and lives with a wealthy family Tonya knows from her work.

Tonya leads a community effort to demolish the housing project and build a new better one instead. In an attempt to gain support for her cause, Tonya reaches out to Leo in a lecture and asks him to sign her petition calling for the demolition of the project. He initially defends his work, but later comes up with an idea on how to improve the project by modifying its current design without the need for a complete demolition. He later invites Tonya to his house to share his vision but she is appalled by his proposed approach, especially as he has not bothered to visit the project since it was built.

Meanwhile, Martin travels to the housing project to see it for himself, and meets Shawn, young gay prostitute who lives in the project. Shawn had attempted suicide by jumping off a roof of a building, in the same manner Tonya&#x27;s own son killed himself.

Leo goes to the housing project to meet Tonya. He tells her that he agrees to sign her petition, but she informs him that the authorities have already agreed to demolish the project. Martin walks to the roof of one of the buildings, where he unexpectedly bumps into his own father, and they share a silent emotional gaze.

<doc id="1086223" wikidata="Q7774019" url="?curid=1086223" title="The Weathermen (band)">
<text>The Weathermen are a semi-satirical Belgium-based electronic and pop band.

== History ==
The Weathermen began as a joke. A couple of Americano-Belgians recorded some music and then sent it to a local record company via the US under the pretence they were a couple of enigmatic Americans trying to invade the European music scene. It worked and they were signed to Play It Again Sam (PIAS) Records who put out their first 12&quot; &quot;Old Friend Sam&quot; in 1985. They recruited the assistance of Tuxedomoon&#x27;s visual specialist Bruce Geduldig who adopted the alias of Chuck B, a debauched playboy vocalist. He brought even more humour and satire to the already amused Weathermen. The name &quot;The Weathermen&quot; was inspired from a line in famous folk/rock artist, Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; in which a line goes &quot;you don&#x27;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows&quot;

More singles followed, moving the band away from alternative dancey electronic music into slightly satirical poppy EBM music, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1987 that the song &quot;Poison&quot; brought them real attention. With tracks such as &quot;Punishment Park&quot;, the &quot;Black Album&quot; as a whole was like the soundtrack of a dark and tongue-in-cheek movie, something like the Marx Brothers remixing William Gibson. By this time, the group had slimmed down to &#x27;Chuck&#x27; and &#x27;Jimmy-Joe Snark III&#x27;; who was actually mild-mannered producer and keyboardist Jean-Marc Lederman who had worked with the likes of Fad Gadget, The The and Kid Montana.

The band continued in the vein of tongue-in-cheek pop, leaving behind their early harder sound, but they failed to repeat the success of &quot;Poison&quot; on a commercial level.

In 2001, a best of album was almost released by PIAS. Due to frustration and demands from the fanbase and a new generation who had discovered their music through research into other renowned Belgian acts such as Front 242 and A Split-Second, Jimmyjoe Snark III decided to reclaim the album from PIAS and publish it via a website. The only demands made on those downloading it being that they leave a comment in the guestbook. This brought a new legion of fans and enough interest for Jimmy-Joe &amp; Chuck to be thawed out of storage for the creation of some new music.

The album &quot;Deeper with The Weathermen&quot; was released in 2004, followed by &quot;Embedded with The Weathermen&quot; in 2006.

In 2007, PIAS released &quot;The Last Communiqué from The Weathermen&quot;, a compilation of their work from 1985 till 2006.

In 2010, Infacted Recordings released &quot;Ultimate Poison&quot;, a 15 tracks MCD loosely based around &quot;Poison&quot; and all its remixes, plus some unreleased tracks.

<doc id="1086224" wikidata="Q366838" url="?curid=1086224" title="Victor Ashe">
<text>Victor Henderson Ashe II (born January 1, 1945) is an American former diplomat and politician who served as United States Ambassador to Poland. From 1987 to 2004, he was mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee. Ashe is a Republican. Ambassador Ashe concluded his service as Ambassador to Poland on September 26, 2009.

==Early career==
Ashe was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, where he attended public school. He attended the Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts and subsequently the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. He graduated from Yale University in 1967 with a BA in history. At Yale, Ashe was a member of the Skull and Bones society, as was George W. Bush. In 1974 he earned his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Tennessee College of Law. Before becoming an elected official, Ashe worked as an intern for Congressman Bill Brock, and as a staff assistant for Senator Howard Baker.

In 1968 Ashe was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives; he was only 23 years old at the time. Significantly, during that time he championed passage of the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to eighteen, and authored legislation that lowered the age of majority to eighteen as well in 1971. After serving three terms in the State House, Ashe won the August 1974 Republican primary for a Tennessee Senate seat representing Knox County, Tennessee. In a lawsuit brought by a former legislator Ashe had defeated in 1972, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled Ashe ineligible to be the Republican nominee as he would not meet the minimum age qualification of 30 on the day of the general election in November. The Knox County GOP then nominated his mother, Martha Ashe, to replace him as the nominee. She was elected by the voters with the promise to resign in January 1975 when Ashe turned 30. Upon her resignation the Knox County Commission appointed Victor Ashe to replace her; he was later elected to the position and served for nine years.

From 1967 to 1973, during the Vietnam War, Ashe was a member of the United States Marine Corps Air Reserves. He was also the Executive Director of the Americans Outdoors Commission from 1985 until 1987.

He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1984 against future Vice President Al Gore.

==Mayor==
Ashe was elected to be the mayor of Knoxville in November 1987. He served 16 years as mayor, the longest term in the city&#x27;s history. As mayor, Ashe led several initiatives to improve Knoxville&#x27;s civic and financial footing. These initiatives focused on such things as waterfront development along the Tennessee River and the building of a convention center to attract tourism and business. The latter was a cause for controversy, with many residents saying that the city of Knoxville did not offer enough amenities to attract would-be events or shows to a convention center. Other initiatives included downtown redevelopment and sign and billboard control.

Ashe stressed diversity within his administration, noting when he left office the growth of minorities and women on commissions and boards during his time as mayor. While Ashe often had the support of the city council, he was unable to get it to institute a Police Advisory Review Committee to perform as a civilian review of police action, something which, in 1998, he felt was necessary to investigate the questionable deaths of three black men at the hands of police officers. At the time, hostility in the black community toward the police department was extremely high due to these deaths. Ashe circumvented the council and established the committee by executive order. Three years later, the council unanimously ratified the order, defusing growing protests for recall elections for Ashe and other councilors .

===Parkland and public domain===
As mayor, Ashe favored preserving buildings that had possible historic value, at one point threatening to put historic zoning restrictions on a building its owners wished to demolish.

Ashe was a strong supporter of parkland in the city, and during his tenure, parkland in Knoxville was increased from 700 to and of greenway was added. He initiated a program called &quot;Penny for the Parks&quot; to create a trust fund that would use a one cent tax and federal matching money to commit $250,000 a year for city parks, greenways and historic preservation. After leaving office, Ashe was awarded a Cornelius Amory Pugsley Medal, which was granted by the American Academy for Park and Recreation Administration in recognition of his work on greenways and public parks.

==Ambassador to Poland==

Ashe was sworn in as a US ambassador to Poland in June 2004; during Ashe&#x27;s tenure as mayor of Knoxville he, acting on the advice of Dr. Marek Pienkowski, helped to establish a sister city relationship with the city of Chełm, Poland, and led two delegations to that city.

One of the issues Ashe engaged in when he was appointed ambassador to Poland was the difficulty Poles have getting work and tourist visas for the United States. After Ashe met with President George W. Bush and Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski in Washington in 2005, Bush suggested that the visa rejection rate for Poles be lowered.

Ashe has also noted that Poland has a growing economy that offers many opportunities for US businesses. He is interested in having his own area of Knoxville and East Tennessee take advantage of such opportunities, and in 2005 advised a group of 16 Knoxville-area businesses to put together a trade mission to Poland.

On March 16, 2009 he was honoured by President of Poland Lech Kaczyński with Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, for his contribution to Polish-American cooperation. He was decorated on September 25, 2009 by Mariusz Handzlik, undersecretary of state in President&#x27;s Office.

==Board memberships==
Ashe was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service in 1996, and he served until 2000.

Ashe serves on the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the body which supervises the federal agencies which broadcast to foreign countries. In a 2013 report by the Office of Inspector General, Ashe was criticized as a board member &quot;whose tactics and personal attacks on colleagues and staff have created an unprofessional and unproductive atmosphere&quot;. Ashe was not directly named, but referred to as a &quot;former mayor,&quot; a description which fits only him. Ashe called the report &quot;unwarranted, unfair and factually incorrect&quot; and in his defense pointed to his support from labor.

== Yale Trustee Candidate==
In April 2020, Ashe announced his candidacy for the Yale Corporation, on a platform of reforming the Corporation election process while taking into account alumni voices.

==Personal life==
Ashe and his wife, Joan née Plumlee, have two children together. Ashe is the uncle of professional basketball players Mason Plumlee, Miles Plumlee, and Marshall Plumlee.

<doc id="1086225" wikidata="Q3537060" url="?curid=1086225" title="Simhavishnu">
<text>Simhavishnu (IAST: Siṃhaviṣṇu) also known as Avanisimha son of Simhavarman III and one of the Pallava kings of India, was responsible for the revival of the Pallavan dynasty. He was the first Pallava monarch whose domain extended beyond Kanchipuram (Kanchi) in the South. He was portrayed as a great conqueror in &quot;Mattavilasa Prahasana&quot; (drunken revelry), a drama written by his son Mahendravarman I.

==Reign==
Sailendra Nath Sen 575-600 AD.

T.V. Mahalingam 575–615 CE.

KAN Sastri 555–590 CE.

He ruled at least for 33 years based on the available Hero stones. However, there is no exact consensus as to Simhavishnu&#x27;s period on the throne.

==Expansion of kingdom==
When Simhavishnu ascended the throne, the Pallava dynasty was beginning to reassert its supremacy.

The southern peninsula of India was then ruled by five dynasties. The Pallavas, the Cholas and the Pandyas shared the power in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, parts of southern and eastern Karnataka border and Ceylon; the Cheras controlled Kerala and the Chalukyas controlled Karnataka. Simhavishnu, who was known for his gallant martial courage and judicial wisdom from a young age, overthrew the Kalabhras and conquered the region up to Kaveri, where he came into conflict with the Pandyas and Ceylon. He dispatched a naval expedition and occupied Malaya and Sri Lanka and established Kanchipuram as his capital. The presence of the Pallavas, much before further naval expeditions to Indo-China by their illustrious succeeding and contemporary empires such as the Pandiyans and the Cholas, is attested by the existence of specimen of art bearing striking resemblance in countries like Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, as well as scores of inscriptions in those lands in the Grantha script (a script in which both Tamil and Sanskrit can be written) in which the Pallavas were the first to specialize.

Simhavishnu led the revival of the Pallavas, and the period starting with him came to be known as the Greater Pallavas or Later Pallavas dynasty. The great struggle between the Pallavas and the Chalukyas, which would last for more than two centuries, began during the reign of Simhavishnu.

==Contribution to literature==
Simhavishnu is known to have been the patron of the Sanskrit poet Bharavi, who wrote of the duel between Siva and Arjuna known as Kirata Arjuneeya, after which Shiva blessed Arjuna with the divine Pashupatastra. The structure of Bharavi&#x27;s play suggests that it was written for &quot;koodiyattam&quot; plays for worship in temples during festivals. Kirata Arjuneeya is used as a subject for &quot;koodiyattam&quot; performances even today.

==Religious affiliation==
As with most Indian monarchs, Simhavishnu was also religious.

In the Udayendiram copper plates of Nandivarman II, Simhavishnu was a devotee of Vishnu. This is a noteworthy point as his son Mahendravarman I was a Jaina who opposed all the Shaivite practices before being converted to Shaivism. Simhavishnu&#x27;s portrait can be seen in the stone engraving at the Adivaraha Mandapam, an elegant shrine at Mahabalipuram. The monuments and temples in Mahabalipuram are achievements of the Pallava dynasty, and they still exist in Tamil Nadu. Simhavishnu was succeeded by his son Mahendravarman I.

<text>Al-ʿAbbās ibn Saʿid al-Jawharī (; ), known as Al-Jawhari, was a geometer who worked at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad and for in a short time in Damascus, where he made astronomical observations. Born (and probably dying) in Baghdad, he was probably of Iranian origin. His most important work was his commentary on &quot;Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot;, which contained nearly 50 additional propositions and an attempted mathematical proof of the parallel postulate.

Described as having superb knowledge of Greek, which was unusual for a Muslim scholar), Al-Jawhari is credited with a translation into Arabic of the Indian polymath Shanaq al-Hindi&#x27;s &quot;Book of Poisons&quot;.

<text>Stereolithography (SLA or SL; also known as vat photopolymerisation, optical fabrication, photo-solidification, or resin printing) is a form of 3D printing technology used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts in a layer by layer fashion using photochemical processes by which light causes chemical monomers and oligomers to cross-link together to form polymers. Those polymers then make up the body of a three-dimensional solid. Research in the area had been conducted during the 1970s, but the term was coined by Chuck Hull in 1984 when he applied for a patent on the process, which was granted in 1986. Stereolithography can be used to create prototypes for products in development, medical models, and computer hardware, as well as in many other applications. While stereolithography is fast and can produce almost any design, it can be expensive.

==History==
Stereolithography or &quot;SLA&quot; printing is an early and widely used 3D printing technology. In the early 1980s, Japanese researcher Hideo Kodama first invented the modern layered approach to stereolithography by using ultraviolet light to cure photosensitive polymers. In 1984, just before Chuck Hull filed his own patent, Alain Le Mehaute, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude André filed a patent for the stereolithography process. The French inventors&#x27; patent application was abandoned by the French General Electric Company (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and CILAS (The Laser Consortium). Le Mehaute believes that the abandonment reflects a problem with innovation in France.

The term “stereolithography” (Greek: stereo-solid and lithography) was coined in 1984 by Chuck Hull when he filed his patent for the process. Hull patented stereolithography as a method of creating 3D objects by successively &quot;printing&quot; thin layers of an object using a medium curable by ultraviolet light, starting from the bottom layer to the top layer. Hull&#x27;s patent described a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light focused onto the surface of a vat filled with a liquid photopolymer. The beam is focused onto the surface of the liquid photopolymer, creating each layer of the desired 3D object by means of crosslinking (generation of intermolecular bonds in polymers). It was invented with the intent of allowing engineers to create prototypes of their designs in a more time effective manner. After the patent was granted in 1986, Hull co-founded the world&#x27;s first 3D printing company, 3D Systems, to commercialize it.

Stereolithography&#x27;s success in the automotive industry allowed 3D printing to achieve industry status and the technology continues to find innovative uses in many fields of study. Attempts have been made to construct mathematical models of stereolithography processes and to design algorithms to determine whether a proposed object may be constructed using 3D printing.

==Technology==
Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process that, in its most common form, works by focusing an ultraviolet (UV) laser on to a vat of photopolymer resin. With the help of computer aided manufacturing or computer-aided design (CAM/CAD) software, the UV laser is used to draw a pre-programmed design or shape on to the surface of the photopolymer vat. Photopolymers are sensitive to ultraviolet light, so the resin is photochemically solidified and forms a single layer of the desired 3D object. Then, the build platform lowers one layer and a blade recoats the top of the tank with resin. This process is repeated for each layer of the design until the 3D object is complete. Completed parts must be washed with a solvent to clean wet resin from their surfaces.

It is also possible to print objects &quot;bottom up&quot; by using a vat with a transparent bottom and focusing the UV or deep-blue polymerization laser upward through the bottom of the vat. An inverted stereolithography machine starts a print by lowering the build platform to touch the bottom of the resin-filled vat, then moving upward the height of one layer. The UV laser then writes the bottom-most layer of the desired part through the transparent vat bottom. Then the vat is &quot;rocked&quot;, flexing and peeling the bottom of the vat away from the hardened photopolymer; the hardened material detaches from the bottom of the vat and stays attached to the rising build platform, and new liquid photopolymer flows in from the edges of the partially built part. The UV laser then writes the second-from-bottom layer and repeats the process. An advantage of this bottom-up mode is that the build volume can be much bigger than the vat itself, and only enough photopolymer is needed to keep the bottom of the build vat continuously full of photopolymer. This approach is typical of desktop SLA printers, while the right-side-up approach is more common in industrial systems.

Stereolithography requires the use of supporting structures which attach to the elevator platform to prevent deflection due to gravity, resist lateral pressure from the resin-filled blade, or retain newly created sections during the &quot;vat rocking&quot; of bottom up printing. Supports are typically created automatically during the preparation of CAD models and can also be made manually. In either situation, the supports must be removed manually after printing.

Other forms of stereolithography build each layer by LCD masking, or using a DLP projector.

== Materials ==
The liquid materials used for SLA printing are commonly referred to as &quot;resins&quot; and are thermoset polymers. A wide variety of resins are commercially available and it is also possible to use homemade resins to test different compositions for example. Material properties vary according to formulation configurations: &quot;materials can be soft or hard, heavily filled with secondary materials like glass and ceramic, or imbued with mechanical properties like high heat deflection temperature or impact resistance&quot;. Recently, some studies have tested the possibility to green or reusable materials to produce &quot;sustainable&quot; resins. It is possible to classify the resins in the following categories:
* Standard resins, for general prototyping
* Engineering resins, for specific mechanical and thermal properties
* Dental and medical resins, for biocompatibility certifications
* Castable resins, for zero ash-content after burnout
* Biomaterial resins, formulated as aqueous solutions of synthetic polymers like polyethylene glycol, or biological polymers such as gelatin, dextran, or hyaluronic acid.

== Uses ==

=== Medical modeling ===

Stereolithographic models have been used in medicine since the 1990s, for creating accurate 3D models of various anatomical regions of a patient, based on data from computer scans. Medical modelling involves first acquiring a CT, MRI, or other scan. This data consists of a series of cross sectional images of the human anatomy. In these images different tissues show up as different levels of grey. Selecting a range of grey values enables specific tissues to be isolated. A region of interest is then selected and all the pixels connected to the target point within that grey value range are selected. This enables a specific organ to be selected. This process is referred to as segmentation. The segmented data may then be translated into a format suitable for stereolithography. While stereolithography is normally accurate, the accuracy of a medical model depends on many factors, especially the operator performing the segmentation correctly. There are potential errors possible when making medical models using stereolithography but these can be avoided with practice and well trained operators.

Stereolithographic models are used as an aid to diagnosis, preoperative planning and implant design and manufacture. This might involve planning and rehearsing osteotomies, for example. Surgeons use models to help plan surgeries but prosthetists and technologists also use models as an aid to the design and manufacture of custom-fitting implants. For instance, medical models created through stereolithography can be used to help in the construction of Cranioplasty plates.

In 2019, scientists at Rice University published an article in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, presenting soft hydrogel materials for stereolithography used in biological research applications.

===Prototyping===

Stereolithography is often used for prototyping parts. For a relatively low price, stereolithography can produce accurate prototypes, even of irregular shapes. Businesses can use those prototypes to assess the design of their product or as publicity for the final product.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
One of the advantages of stereolithography is its speed; functional parts can be manufactured within a day. The length of time it takes to produce a single part depends upon the complexity of the design and the size. Printing time can last anywhere from hours to more than a day. SLA printed parts, unlike those obtained from FFF/FDM, do not exhibit significant anisotropy (structural non-uniformity) and there&#x27;s no visible layering pattern. The surface quality is, in general, superior. Prototypes and designs made with stereolithography are strong enough to be machined and can also be used to make master patterns for injection molding or various metal casting processes.

===Disadvantages===
Although stereolithography can be used to produce virtually any synthetic design, it is often costly (due to costlier machines compared to FFF, costlier resin and costly post-processing steps such as washing and curing), though the price is coming down. Since 2012, however, public interest in 3D printing has inspired the design of several consumer SLA machines which can cost considerably less.
Beginning in 2016, substitution of the SLA and DLP methods using a high resolution, high contrast LCD panel has brought prices down to below 200. The layers are created in their entirety since the entire layer is displayed on the LCD screen and is exposed using UV LEDs that lie below. Resolutions of .01mm are attainable.
Another disadvantage is that the photopolymers are sticky, messy, and need to be handled with care. Newly made parts need to be washed, further cured, and dried. The environmental impact of all these processes requires more study to be understood, but in general SLA technologies have not created any biodegradable or compostable forms of resin, while other 3-D printing methods offer some compostable PLA options. The choice of materials is limited compared to FFF, which can process virtually any thermoplastic.

<doc id="1086244" wikidata="Q7975733" url="?curid=1086244" title="Waxworm">
<text>Waxworms are the caterpillar larvae of wax moths, which belong to the family Pyralidae (snout moths). Two closely related species are commercially bred – the lesser wax moth (&quot;Achroia grisella&quot;) and the greater wax moth (&quot;Galleria mellonella&quot;). They belong to the tribe Galleriini in the snout moth subfamily Galleriinae. Another species whose larvae share that name is the Indianmeal moth (&quot;Plodia interpunctella&quot;), though this species is not available commercially.

The adult moths are sometimes called &quot;bee moths&quot;, but, particularly in apiculture, this can also refer to &quot;Aphomia sociella&quot;, another Galleriinae moth which also produces waxworms, but is not commercially bred.

Waxworms are medium-white caterpillars with black-tipped feet and small, black or brown heads.

In the wild, they live as nest parasites in bee colonies and eat cocoons, pollen, and shed skins of bees, and chew through beeswax, thus the name. Beekeepers consider waxworms to be pests. &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot; (the greater wax moths) will not attack the bees directly, but feed on the wax used by the bees to build their honeycomb. Their full development to adults requires access to used brood comb or brood cell cleanings—these contain protein essential for the larvae&#x27;s development, in the form of brood cocoons. The destruction of the comb will spill or contaminate stored honey and may kill bee larvae or be the cause of the spreading of honey bee diseases.

When kept in captivity, they can go a long time without eating, particularly if kept at a cool temperature. Captive waxworms are usually raised on a mixture of cereal grain, bran, and honey.

==Waxworms as a food source==
Waxworms are a commonly used food for many insectivorous animals and plants in captivity. 
These larvae are grown extensively for use as food for humans, as well as live food for terrarium pets and some pet birds, mostly due to their high fat content, their ease of breeding, and their ability to survive for weeks at low temperatures. They are recommended for use as a treat rather than a staple food, due to their relative lack of nutrients when compared to crickets and mealworms. Their high fat and food energy (caloric) density can also contribute to obesity in captive animals if they are fed waxworms too often, especially in animals with a low metabolism, such as reptiles.

Most commonly, they are used to feed reptiles such as bearded dragons (species in the genus &quot;Pogona&quot;), the neon tree dragon (&quot;Japalura splendida)&quot;, geckos, brown anoles (&quot;Anolis sagrei&quot;), turtles such as the three-toed box turtle (&quot;Terrapene carolina triunguis&quot;), and chameleons. They can also be fed to amphibians such as &quot;Ceratophrys&quot; frogs, newts such as Strauch&#x27;s spotted newt (&quot;Neurergus strauchii&quot;), and salamanders such as axolotls. Small mammals such as the domesticated hedgehog can also be fed with waxworms, while birds such as the greater honeyguide can also appreciate the food. They can also be used as food for captive predatory insects reared in terraria, such as assassin bugs in the genus &quot;Platymeris&quot;, and are also occasionally used to feed certain kinds of fish in the wild, such as bluegills (&quot;Lepomis macrochirus&quot;).

==Waxworms as bait==
Waxworms may be store-bought or raised by anglers. Anglers and fishing bait shops often refer to the larvae as &quot;waxies&quot;. They are used for catching some varieties of panfish, members of the sunfish family (Centrarchidae), green sunfish (&quot;Lepomis cyanellus&quot;) and can be used for shallow-water fishing with the use of a lighter weight. They are also used for fishing some members of the family Salmonidae, masu salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus masou&quot;), white-spotted char (&quot;Salvelinus leucomaenis&quot;), and rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;).

===Uses===
====Fishing====
Anglers use waxworms usually provided by commercial suppliers to catch trout.
Waxworms are popular bait for anglers in Japan. Anglers throw handfuls into the &quot;swim&quot; they are targeting, attracting the trout to the area. The angler then uses the largest or most attractive waxworms on the hook, hoping to be irresistible to the fish.

==Waxworms as an alternative to mammals in animal research==
Waxworms can replace mammals in certain types of scientific experiments with animal testing, especially in studies examining the virulence mechanisms of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Waxworms prove valuable in such studies because the innate immune system of insects is strikingly similar to that of mammals. Waxworms survive well at human body temperature and are large enough in size to allow straightforward handling and accurate dosing. Additionally, the considerable cost savings when using waxworms instead of small mammals (usually mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs) allows testing throughput that is otherwise impossible. Using waxworms, it is now possible to screen large numbers of bacterial and fungal strains to identify genes involved in pathogenesis or large chemical libraries with the hope of identifying promising therapeutic compounds. The later studies have proved especially useful in identifying chemical compounds with favorable bioavailability.

==Biodegradation of plastic==
Two species of waxworm, &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot; and &quot;Plodia interpunctella&quot; have both been observed eating and digesting polyethylene plastic (plastivory). The waxworms metabolize polyethylene plastic films into ethylene glycol, a compound which biodegrades rapidly. This unusual ability to digest matter classically thought of as non-edible may originate with the waxworm&#x27;s ability to digest beeswax as a result of gut microbes that are essential in the biodegradation process. Two strains of bacteria, &quot;Enterobacter asburiae&quot; and &quot;Bacillus sp&quot;, isolated from the guts of &quot;Plodia interpunctella&quot; waxworms, have been shown to decompose polyethylene in laboratory testing. In a test with a 28-day incubation period of these two strains of bacteria on polyethylene films, the films&#x27; hydrophobicity decreased. In addition, damage to the films&#x27; surface with pits and cavities (0.3–0.4 μm in depth) was observed using scanning electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy.

Placed in a polyethylene shopping bag, about 100 &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot; waxworms consumed almost of the plastic over the course of 12 hours in laboratory conditions.

A non-peer reviewed research study in 2020 questioned the ability of &quot;G. mellonella&quot; caterpillars to digest and biologically degrade polyethylene.

<text>Joseph Edward Smadel (1907–1963) was a U.S. medical doctor and virologist. He introduced chloramphenicol as treatment for rickettsial diseases. In 1962, he became the first recipient of the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research .

==Biography==
Smadel was born in Vincennes, Indiana, the son of medical doctor Joseph William Smadel and former nurse Clara Greene Smadel. He completed his undergraduate work at the University of Pennsylvania then obtained a medical degree from the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis in 1931. It was at Washington University that he met his future wife, Elizabeth Moore. Smadel was a member of the virological team that first recognized an outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis in 1933.

Smadel then moved on to New York City to work under scientists Homer Swift and Thomas M. Rivers at the Rockefeller Institute. While there, Smadel took a strong interest in the new field of virology. He formed a productive, long term professional association with Dr. Rivers, the two of them jointly publishing numerous articles. Utilizing the then new techniques of ultra-centrifugation and chemical fractionation, Smadel made significant contributions to the understanding of myxomatosis, viral encephalitis, variola, vaccinia, and psittacosis.

Smadel joined the U.S. Naval Reserve in December, 1940, but went on full-time active duty with the U.S. Army’s Medical Department Professional Service School (MDPSS) in August, 1942. (The MDPSS officially became the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in 1953 after a number of intermediate name changes.) The freshly commissioned Captain Smadel was assigned as Chief Virologist with the First Medical General Laboratory in the European Theater with the mission of controlling the outbreak of typhus fever in the Mediterranean region in May 1943. Following the Normandy invasion, he was assigned to an advanced field laboratory in France. Following the Allied victory in Europe, Lieutenant Colonel Smadel became the director of the Department Of Virus and Rickettsial Diseases with at the WRAIR, a position he held after his return to civilian life. Perhaps Smadel&#x27;s most notable professional achievement was the series of field studies in Kuala Lumpur in 1948 which established chloramphenicol as an effective treatment for typhus and typhoid fever.

In the 1950s, under Smadel&#x27;s direction, WRAIR established itself as one of the première institutes for the study of infectious diseases. Research programs there included the study of leptospirosis, plague, hemorrhagic fever, arboviral diseases, enteric diseases, cholera, and rickettsial diseases such as typhus.

Smadel after exerting much pressure on Jonas Salk and Basil O&#x27;Connor was in early 1954 given the assignment of writing the production protocols for the Polio Vaccine.

In 1956 Smadel left the institute to become the associate director of the National Institutes of Health. In 1963, he assumed a new position as chief, Laboratory of Virology and Rickettsiology, Division of Biologics Standards, National Institutes of Health, which he held until his death.

==Honors and accolades==
*In 1962, Smadel was awarded the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award.

<doc id="1086248" wikidata="Q549148" url="?curid=1086248" title="Persephone (The Matrix)">
<text>Persephone is a fictional character in &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise. She is portrayed by Monica Bellucci. In the films &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, Persephone is married to the Merovingian. She seems bored with her existence in the Matrix, and is dissatisfied with her husband (possibly because of his constant infidelities).

==Films==
In &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, Persephone meets Neo, Trinity and Morpheus when they come to talk with The Merovingian, her husband. Though her husband declines to help the human resistance, Persephone is sexually attracted to Neo and offers to help him if he kisses her with the same passion with which he has kissed Trinity. Reluctantly, he complies and she helps him free the Keymaker. Later, she kills one of her husband&#x27;s employees.

In &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, Persephone warns the Merovingian that Trinity would indeed kill everyone in Club Hel to free Neo from the Train Station, simply because she is in love. This suggests that Persephone perceives and understands love, and may be disheartened by the cynicism of her husband, who seems to be driven solely by greed and lust.

In &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, Persephone makes a quick cameo appearance through archive footage from &quot;Reloaded&quot; while Neo remembers his past adventures sixty years after bringing peace to humans and Machines. While the Merovingian and some of his henchmen are revealed to have survived The Analyst&#x27;s purge over the Matrix, Persephone&#x27;s status is unconfirmed.

==&quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;==
In the video game &quot;Enter The Matrix&quot;, Persephone encounters and takes a kiss from either Niobe or Ghost (depending on whose story the player follows). She seems to be able to deduce the feelings and emotions of those she kisses, noting Niobe&#x27;s love for Morpheus, or Ghost&#x27;s unrequited love for Trinity. She apparently takes deep pleasure in sampling the emotions of others.

==&quot;The Matrix Online&quot;==
In the MMO &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, Persephone gave the location of the Assassin&#x27;s hide-out to Zion operatives in a critical mission relating to the Death Of A Destroyer event.

==Cultural references==
The character&#x27;s name is taken from that of Persephone in Greek mythology, who is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter (Ceres), and whom Hades took to the underworld to be his queen.

Before shooting her husband&#x27;s employee in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, Persephone wonders aloud, &quot;How many people keep silver bullets in their gun?&quot;, implying that the employee is a werewolf. In behind-the-scenes footage, Persephone herself is compared to a &quot;vampire that seeks after emotions&quot; by actress Monica Bellucci.

==In popular culture==
In a 2012 survey by Empire Cinemas, Persephone was listed among the sexiest characters in cinema.

Likewise, Nettavisen declared in 2009 that the role of Persephone qualified Monica Bellucci as one of the 25 sexiest women of all time.

<doc id="1086249" wikidata="Q16951713" url="?curid=1086249" title="Sun City Agreement">
<text>The Sun City Agreement was an agreement signed between some of the warring parties in the Second Congo War on 2 April 2002 at the luxury South African casino resort of Sun City, as a result of the Inter-Congolese dialogue (ICD). Delegates hoped that this would be a historic &quot;final act&quot;, ending more than four years of war and setting up a government of national unity.

The agreement was witnessed by South African President Thabo Mbeki as well as the heads of state of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In his speech during the meeting, Mbeki praised the delegates who had spent 19 months involved in the ICD negotiations.

==Participants==
The partial agreement was reached between the government, the Ugandan-backed &quot;Mouvement de liberation du Congo&quot; (MLC) armed opposition group and a majority of civil society and unarmed political opposition groups. Unfortunately, the parties were not able to establish a new constitution and government, despite repeated attempts. 

However, another armed opposition movement, the &quot;Rassemblement congolais pour la democratie&quot; (RCD-Goma), backed by Rwanda, along with several parties of the unarmed political opposition including the &quot;Union pour la Democratie et le Progres Social&quot; (UDPS) of the veteran Congolese politician and former prime minister, Etienne Tshisekedi refused to sign the accord, which led to concerns about a return to violence.

==Treaty terms==
The agreement laid down a framework for providing the Congo with a unified, multi-party government and a timeline for democratic elections.

Among other stipulations, the agreement allowed Joseph Kabila to remain president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo during a transition period of two years, extendable to three, with Jean-Pierre Bemba (the leader of the MLC) serving as prime minister in a transitional government.

It was further stipulated that Kabila would share power with four vice-presidents - one from each of the two main armed opposition movements, one from the government and one from the unarmed political opposition. Ministries would be divided up and former opposition fighters would be integrated into the army and police.

After the conclusion of the accord, critics noted that there were no stipulations regarding the unification of the army, which weakened the effectiveness of the agreement. There were several reported breaches of the agreement, but initially it resulted in a reduction in the fighting.

There was also criticism that the delegates were not provided with a complete dossier of documentation at the end of the agreement (such as minutes of meetings, commission reports and resolutions), which hindered informed debate in the Congo. It was also felt that the principles which guided the formation of the follow-up organs of the Sun City Agreement were not clear.

The Sun City Agreement did not stop the conflict, as shown by subsequent events (see Second Congo War).

During the agreement, the delegates considered giving the country of the Democratic Republic of the Congo away to the Kingdom of Belgium in exchange for humanitarian aid and sending an intervention force to help the central government fight the Rwandan/Ugandan backed Congolese rebels.

<text>is a 2004 Japanese drama film about a guide dog, first released in Japan on 13 March 2004 and on DVD on 25 September 2004. It was also shown at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival in Canada on 17 September 2004.

The film is directed by Yōichi Sai and adapted from the original novel by Ryohei Akimoto and Kengo Ishiguro, based on a true story. Prior to the release of this film, NHK produced a TV drama adaptation of the novel, which aired from June 16 to July 28, 2003.

==Plot==
One day in Tokyo, a yellow Labrador Retriever puppy is born among a litter of five. This puppy is unique, wherein he has a bird-shaped mark on his left side. Following a simple communication test, he is selected to become a guide dog; hence his first parting. After being picked up by dog trainer Satoru Tawada, the puppy is flown to Kyoto to live with Isamu and Mitsuko Nii - a married couple who are &quot;puppy walkers&quot;, people who raise guide dogs for a year. There, the couple name him &quot;Quill&quot;, after discovering the word in an English-Japanese dictionary. As soon as Quill reaches the age of one, he is handed back to Tawada to undergo guide dog training; this becomes his second parting. At first, Quill has difficulty learning the basic skills, but one day, while tending to another dog, Tawada notices that Quill is excellent in waiting - an important trait in a guide dog.

During training, Quill is introduced to Mitsuru Watanabe, a blind journalist who has relied on a white cane since losing his eyesight. Watanabe, at first, is skeptical about using a guide dog, but after walking with Quill for the first time, he realizes that he can travel faster and safer with the dog. Watanabe then undergoes training to work with Quill; most of the training involves learning English-language commands, so as to not confuse Quill when other people around him are talking in Japanese. He fails the final examination after not listening to Quill&#x27;s warnings on obstacles, but they begin to work more cohesively for Watanabe to obtain his guide dog owner license. Quill moves in with Watanabe&#x27;s family and works with his master for two years. Then one day, Watanabe is confined to the hospital when his diabetes takes its turn for the worse, resulting in kidney failure. Quill is returned to the training center, where he works as a demonstration dog for two years before finally reuniting with Watanabe. Their walk, however, is their final one, as Watanabe dies a few days later. Quill&#x27;s third parting occurs after visiting Watanabe&#x27;s funeral.

Quill no longer works as a guide dog; instead, he becomes the center&#x27;s demonstration dog for seven years before he is reunited with the Nii family. He lives a happy and peaceful life for a year, but one day, while playing at the backyard, he falls off a step and breaks several bones. As they look over a dying Quill throughout the night, the couple thank him and tell him to tell those in heaven who he is. Quill passes away at the age of 12 years, 25 days.

==Box office==
&quot;Quill&quot; was a commercial success becoming the 21st highest-grossing film in Japan of 2004 earning $19,270,242.

== Reception ==
The film received generally positive reviews. Based on 19 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 80% rating and an average score of 6.7 out of 10. On Metacritic, the film has a 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics.

Roger Ebert scored the film at three out of four, commenting that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t use fake closeups to show the dog being cute or funny. It doesn&#x27;t dub Quill&#x27;s &#x27;dialogue&#x27; or even worse, use CGI to move his jaw and show him &#x27;speaking.&#x27; Quill is a dog, and that is quite enough.&quot;. David Nusair of &quot;Reelfilm&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half out of four, saying that &quot;while the movie does occasionally seem to dwell unnecessarily on some of the more unpleasant aspects of Quill&#x27;s life, this is the sort of movie kids will probably enjoy more than adults (yet grown-ups can easily watch this without checking the old watch every couple of minutes)&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD in the U.S. as Quill: The Life of a Guide Dog by Music Box Films on July 10, 2012.

<text>Robert Wedderburn (1762 – 1835/1836?) was a British-Jamaican radical and abolitionist of multiracial descent active in early 19th-century London. Wedderburn was born in Kingston, Jamaica, an illegitimate son of an enslaved Black woman, Rosanna, and Scottish sugar planter James Wedderburn. During his life, Robert Wedderburn sought to reconcile his political priorities and religious views. 

Influenced by millenarian ideas, he moved from Methodism and towards Unitarian leanings, before rejecting Christianity and embracing a deist outlook. An early freethinker, the combination of his deist views, associations with well-known radicals and atheists, and utopian political ideals, led to his arrest for breach of blasphemy laws. In 1824 he published &quot;The Horrors of Slavery&quot;, a tract which influenced the Abolitionist movement.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Robert Wedderburn was born in Jamaica in around 1762. His mother Rosanna was a black woman of dark brown complexion, and was enslaved in his white Scottish father&#x27;s house as a house worker. His father was James Wedderburn, a slave-owner and plantation owner who was born in Scotland, and was the son of Sir John Wedderburn, 5th Baronet of Blackness, who was executed for treason following the Jacobite rising of 1745. Following this catastrophe, the young James and his brother John Wedderburn of Ballendean fled Scotland for the West Indies. James Wedderburn settled in Kingston, making a living as a medical doctor before making his fortune as a sugar plantation owner. While in Jamaica he fathered children with several enslaved women.

While Rosanna was five months pregnant with his third child, having already given birth to two children prior to that, he sold her to her previous enslaver. 

James Wedderburn stipulated, however, that Rosanna&#x27;s child when born should be legally free, and he officially registered both Robert and an elder brother James as free men. In later years, James Wedderburn returned to live in Britain, where his legitimate son and heir Andrew Colvile defended his father when these details were made public in the British press, denied the paternity and further claimed Rosanna was both promiscuous and unable to control her temper. 

Although born free, Wedderburn was raised in a harsh environment, as his mother was often flogged due to her &quot;violent and rebellious temper&quot;. She was eventually re-sold away from her son, who was then raised by his maternal grandmother, a woman known as &quot;Talkee Amy&quot;.

To escape the insecurity and abuse of the plantation, Wedderburn signed on with the Royal Navy at the age of 16. On the ships, the quality of food and living conditions were abysmal, and it was during this time that Wedderburn became increasingly opposed to the method of punishments used by the Royal Navy.

===Arrival in Britain===
Robert Wedderburn arrived in Britain aged 17 and settled down in St. Giles, London, an ethnically diverse district of the city which was inhabited by numerous free people of colour, Jews, Indian sailors and Irish immigrants. During this period, Wedderburn found employment as a tailor, becoming trained in the profession; though he was also reported to have been involved in occasional incidents of petty theft.

Through means that remain unclear (it is possible that he had been an apprentice in Jamaica or had learned while in the Navy), Wedderburn eventually became a journeyman tailor. As he referred to himself as a &quot;flint&quot; tailor, this suggests he was registered in the book of trades and shared values typical of other artisans - including pride in his craft and a belief in economic independence. Unfortunately, the instability of his career made him increasingly susceptible to the effects of a trade recession, inflation and food shortages, and he was soon reduced to part-time mending work on the outskirts of town.

By now married and desperate for money during one of his wife&#x27;s pregnancies, Wedderburn visited his father&#x27;s family at Inveresk near Edinburgh. He recalled that his father did not deny him to be his son &quot;but called me a &quot;lazy fellow&quot;, and said he would do nothing for me. From his cook I had one draught of small beer, and his footman gave me a cracked sixpence&quot;. Wedderburn thereafter dabbled in petty theft and keeping a bawdy house. In 1824, &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot; published a letter from Robert Wedderburn addressed to William Wilberforce giving an account of his origins and his father&#x27;s failure to provide for him. It also published his alleged half-brother, Andrew Colvile&#x27;s, reply citing his father&#x27;s denial of paternity and threatening to sue the paper if it published any further slanders.

===Radicalism and activity===

In 1786, Wedderburn stopped to listen to a Wesleyan preacher he heard in Seven Dials. Influenced by a mixture of Arminian, millenarian, Calvinist, and Unitarian ideas, he converted to be a Methodist, and soon published a small theological tract called &quot;Truth Self Supported: or, a Refutation of Certain Doctrinal Errors Generally Adopted in the Christian Church&quot;. Although this work contained no explicit mention of slavery, it does suggest Wedderburn&#x27;s future path in subversive and radical political action. 

Wedderburn was sufficiently well known to be the subject of at least one satirical print by the caricaturist George Cruikshank, who in 1817 published &quot;A Peep into The City of London Tavern&quot; in which Wedderburn is caricatured alongside the social reformer Robert Owen. The central figure in Cruikshank&#x27;s 1819 print &quot;The New Union Club&quot; may also be a caricature of Wedderburn. 

Politically influenced by Thomas Spence, Wedderburn was an impassioned speaker and became de facto leader of the Spencean Society in 1817 after the nominal leaders were arrested on suspicion of high treason. Wedderburn published fiery periodicals advocating republican revolution, using violence if necessary, to bring about redistribution of property in Britain and the West Indies. In 1824, he published an anti-slavery book entitled &quot;The Horrors of Slavery&quot;, printed by William Dugdale and possibly coauthored by George Cannon.

To promote his religious message, he opened his own Unitarian chapel in Hopkins Street in Soho, London. After, he began to question Christian tenets. He was later associated with the freethought movement, including popular deists and atheists such as Richard Carlile. He also campaigned for freedom of speech.

===Prison===

Robert Wedderburn served several prison terms. According to Peter Linebaugh (2000) it is recorded that Wedderburn &quot;did time in Cold Bath Fields, Dorchester, and Giltspur Street Compter prisons for theft, blasphemy, and keeping a bawdy house.&quot; While imprisoned, alongside his associate Richard Carlile, Wedderburn wrote a letter to Francis Place.

In 1831, at the age of 68, he was arrested and sent to Giltspur Street Prison and sentenced to two years in jail, having been convicted of keeping a brothel. On his release he appears to have gone to New York City, where a newspaper records his involvement in a fraud case and refers to him as &quot;a tailor and breeches maker, field preacher, anti-bank deposite politician, romance writer, circulating librarian, and ambulating dealer in drugs, deism, and demoralization in general&quot;. He returned to London shortly after. His last mention in the historical record was in March 1834 when a Home Office informer listed him as present among the congregation at the Theobald&#x27;s Road Institute.

===Death and legacy===
The exact year of his death is unknown, although it appears to have been before official registers of death began to be kept in 1837. He may be the &quot;Robert Wedderborn&quot; who died aged 72 in Bethnal Green and was buried in a non-conformist ceremony on 4 January 1835.

Some have located Wedderburn&#x27;s deism, radicalism, and secularism within a history of British humanism. The Humanist Heritage website recalls that &quot;Wedderburn and others like him fostered a humanist tradition of rationalism, compassion, and tolerance, suffering the effects of blasphemy laws the like of which humanists continue to fight today.&quot;

==Descendants==
The British Labour politician Bill Wedderburn, Baron Wedderburn of Charlton, was a direct descendant of Robert Wedderburn.

<doc id="1086267" wikidata="Q2281146" url="?curid=1086267" title="Bruce Palmer">
<text>Bruce Palmer (September 9, 1946 – October 1, 2004) was a Canadian musician best known as the bassist in the folk rock band Buffalo Springfield, who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Early years==
Palmer was born in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, later moving with his family to Toronto, Ontario, where in the early 1960s he began pursuing a musical career. He started out playing with Robbie Lane and the Disciples, then graduated to a local, otherwise all-black group fronted by Billy Clarkson. Next came British invasion-inspired Jack London &amp; The Sparrows (which, after Palmer left, evolved into Steppenwolf). In early 1965 he left to join The Mynah Birds where he first met Neil Young who was playing lead guitar in the band. The Mynah Birds, fronted by future funk legend Rick James, had a bright future and were signed to the prestigious Motown Records to do some demo recordings before it was discovered that James was actually in Toronto to avoid serving in Vietnam with the United States Navy, from which he had gone AWOL. A planned single, &quot;It&#x27;s My Time&quot; b/w &quot;Go On and Cry&quot;, was withdrawn just prior to its scheduled release by Motown. Both sides of this single were included in the 2006 box set &quot;The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 6: 1966&quot;, released in a limited edition of 6000 by Universal label Hip-O-Select, marking the first time any of the 1966 Motown recordings by the Mynah Birds had seen the light of day.

The group was forced to disband, and Young and Palmer drove Young&#x27;s hearse to Los Angeles in the hope of meeting Stephen Stills, a journeyman folk musician with whom Young had played briefly in Canada two years earlier. Within two days of arriving in Los Angeles, Young and Palmer were driving on Sunset Boulevard and Stills was coming in the opposite direction. When Stills saw the Ontario licence plates, he turned around and pursued the hearse, pulled up beside them and realized who they were. Shortly after, the whole crew pulled into a carpark and introduced themselves. Thus they became the band Buffalo Springfield.

==With Buffalo Springfield==
Young, Palmer, and Stills, along with fellow-Canadian Dewey Martin on drums and Richie Furay on rhythm guitar and vocals, soon formed Buffalo Springfield. The band only had one major national hit, &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; (written and sung by Stills). In Los Angeles their popularity was rivaled only by The Byrds and The Doors. A number of other songs achieved mild prominence, such as &quot;Blue Bird,&quot; &quot;Mr Soul&quot;, &quot;Expecting to Fly&quot;, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, &quot;Down to the Wire&quot;, &quot;Flying On the Ground Is Wrong&quot;, &quot;Go and Say Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Woman&quot;, &quot;Out of My Mind&quot;, &quot;Sit Down, I Think I Love You&quot;, and &quot;On the Way Home&quot;.

Palmer was arrested on numerous occasions for drug possession. These legal problems, compounded by his predilection to stay home reading mystical texts, led to his being shunned by most of the group. Another arrest led to his deportation from the U.S. in January 1967. Palmer was replaced in the band by a rotating group of bassists that included Jim Fielder and Ken Koblun. Shortly thereafter, Young left the group due to tensions with Stills, and Buffalo Springfield played its most prominent concert at the hugely influential Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967 with Doug Hastings and David Crosby filling in for Young. During his time back in Toronto between January and May 1967, Palmer gigged briefly with the local band The Heavenly Government.

In late May, Palmer returned to the U.S. disguised as a businessman, in a suit and tie with his hair cut short, and rejoined the band (Young eventually returned as well). However, the group had lost trust in Palmer and continued to rely on session players despite his return. Palmer continued to rack up a lengthy arrest record, which included another drug possession bust and driving without a licence. In January 1968, Palmer was removed from the band and officially replaced by Jim Messina. He was deported again in March. After embarking on a tour opening for the Beach Boys, Buffalo Springfield disbanded on May 5, 1968, after a final concert at the Long Beach Sports Arena.

==Later years==
Palmer resurfaced in the summer of 1969 for two weeks as the bassist for Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young but was soon replaced by Motown prodigy Greg Reeves. In Toronto, Palmer gigged briefly with Luke &amp; The Apostles in early 1970. In February 1970, he illegally entered the U.S. again, because his attorney said if he did not re-enter and give a deposition in a civil suit, he would face financial ruin. The attorney lost track of Palmer and hired an investigator to find him. He was caught and arrested a year later in January 1971, in Los Angeles. He was deported for the final time in 1972.

In 1971, Palmer released his lone solo record, &quot;The Cycle Is Complete&quot;, on Verve Records. Primarily consisting of three long jams, &quot;Alpha-Omega-Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Oxo&quot;, and &quot;Calm Before the Storm&quot; (with an &quot;Interlude&quot; between the first two numbers), the album featured Palmer playing with the remnants of fellow L.A. psychedelic group Kaleidoscope, Toronto keyboard player Ed Roth and Rick James contributing jazzy scat vocals. The record has been described as a jazzier version of Skip Spence&#x27;s &quot;Oar&quot; or Syd Barrett&#x27;s two solo records – an aural, drug-induced nervous breakdown. The album was a commercial disaster, and Palmer seemingly retired from music.

In 1977, Palmer joined former Kensington Market singer/guitarist Keith McKie and lead guitarist Stan Endersby (formerly of local bands, The Just Us, and Mapleoak) in the Toronto-based group Village for local gigs.

In 1982–1983, Palmer was bassist in Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Trans&quot; Band, and playing a mixture of Young classics and electronica-infused material to audiences throughout America and Europe, as seen on &quot;Neil Young in Berlin&quot;, filmed in 1982.

Palmer was inducted with his Buffalo Springfield bandmates into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Personal life and death==
Palmer was married three times. He had three children.

He died of a heart attack on October 1, 2004, in Belleville, Ontario, at the age of 58.

In the audition Schultz yelled at Dash and while some of the other actresses burst into tears, Walton reacted by laughing. In the same year she made her film debut in &quot;Fistful of Flies&quot;. Her last episode of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; (&quot;The Full Circle&quot;) screened in mid-1999.

In 2009, Walton joined the cast of &quot;City Homicide&quot; in the semi-regular role of criminal profiler, Claudia Leigh. On 27 July 2013, it was announced that Walton had rejoined the cast of &quot;Home and Away&quot; in the recurring role of Jade Montgomery. She was on the show for two seasons.

<text>George Mark Paul Stroumboulopoulos (; Greek: Γεώργιος Μάρκος Παύλος Στρουμπουλόπουλος; born August 16, 1972) is a Canadian media personality, television host and podcaster. He is one of Canada&#x27;s most popular broadcasters and best known as formerly being a VJ for the Canadian music television channel MuchMusic. He was also the host and co-executive producer of the CBC Television talk show &quot;George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight&quot; (formerly &quot;The Hour&quot;) from 2005 to 2014. From 2014 to 2016, Stroumboulopoulos worked for Rogers Media, anchoring &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; and the &quot;NHL on Rogers&quot;. From 2009 to 2023, he was a radio host on CBC Music. Most recently, he joined Apple Music Radio as host of a Monday to Thursday live show.

==Early life==
Stroumboulopoulos was born in Malton, Ontario, a neighbourhood in Mississauga, Ontario, to a Greek father from Egypt and a Ukrainian mother. He was raised in Toronto, primarily by his mother and a close-knit extended family. After graduating from Ascension of Our Lord Secondary School, he graduated from the Radio Broadcasting program at Toronto&#x27;s Humber College in 1993.

==Career==

===Radio===
In spring 1993, Stroumboulopoulos worked at rock radio in Kelowna, British Columbia for a few months before getting a job offer at the Toronto radio station Fan 590 AM, working in talk radio. He then moved to CFNY-FM to host various shows including &quot;Live in Toronto&quot;.

===MuchMusic===
From 2000 to 2004, Stroumboulopoulos worked at MuchMusic as producer and host of &quot;The Punk Show&quot;, then host of &quot;The NewMusic&quot;, &quot;MuchLOUD&quot; and &quot;MuchNews&quot;.

===&quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;===
In 2004, Stroumboulopoulos was featured on CBC television&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; series as the advocate for Tommy Douglas, former Saskatchewan premier and regarded as Canada&#x27;s &quot;Father of Medicare&quot;. More than 1.2 million votes were cast over six weeks, as each of 10 advocates made their case for the top 10 nominees. George made a personal and passionate case for Tommy Douglas, who was named the winner of the contest.

===&quot;The Strombo Show&quot;===
Stroumboulopoulos hosted a long-running Sunday night talk radio show, &quot;The Strombo Show&quot;. Originally aired as a talk show on CFRB in Toronto and CJAD in Montreal, the show moved to the Corus network in November 2007 and the format changed to one of mainly music. &quot;The Strombo Show&quot; broadcast from 102.1 The Edge&#x27;s Toronto studio and on other radio stations in the Corus Entertainment network, including CFOX-FM in Vancouver, Power 97 in Winnipeg, FM96 in London and Y108 in Hamilton.

The show moved to CBC Radio 2 on November 8, 2009, and continued as a music-oriented freeform radio talk show until 2023.

===&quot;George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight/The Hour&quot;===

On January 17, 2005, the first episode of &quot;The Hour&quot; went to air. In the show&#x27;s seventh season, in 2010, the show&#x27;s name changed to &quot;George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight&quot;, and it was shortened from one hour to half an hour. &quot;George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight&quot; was a hybrid of news and celebrity and covered everything from politics, pop culture, the environment, human rights, entertainment, sports and more. It won eight Gemini Awards. There are a range of guests on the show from world leaders to celebrities and politicians. The show concluded at the end of the 2013–2014 season as Stroumboulopoulos moved to Rogers Communications.

===&quot;The One: Making a Music Star&quot;===

In July 2006, Stroumboulopoulos hosted the American reality television talent show, &quot;The One: Making a Music Star&quot; that aired on ABC in the United States, and CBC Television in Canada. It was advertised as a similar show to &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Rock Star&quot; but with the twist that contestants would &quot;live together in a fully functioning music academy&quot;, with their actions documented similar to the &quot;Big Brother&quot; format.

The show was reportedly the most expensive summer series in the history of the ABC network. Its first episode, on July 18, 2006, scored a low audience of 3.08 million viewers, and subsequent episodes had even fewer viewers. The series was cancelled after just two weeks (four episodes) with the final results undecided on July 27, 2006, with no plans for any further episodes.

===&quot;Stroumboulopoulos&quot; on CNN===
Stroumboulopoulos’ hour-long talk series for CNN, &quot;Stroumboulopoulos&quot;, aired during the late spring and the summer of 2013. It was taped before a live audience in Los Angeles, and featured interviews in a format similar to his CBC show. Sometimes, episodes did not air as scheduled. After airing seven episodes from June 14, 2013, to August 16, 2013, CNN did not renew the show.

===&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; and move to Rogers===
On March 10, 2014, Rogers Media, which had acquired exclusive national media rights to the National Hockey League, officially announced that Stroumboulopoulos would serve as the main host of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, beginning in October 2014, replacing Ron MacLean. Concurrently, CBC announced the cancellation of &quot;George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight&quot; after a 10-year run.

Strombo&#x27;s role on &quot;Hockey Night&quot;, which was part of an effort to appeal to younger viewers, received mixed reception. Viewers surveyed upon his introduction felt that he was not a &quot;credible&quot; successor to Ron MacLean, In a move which the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; speculated was meant to help re-gain viewership lost over the first two seasons of the contract (which was also credited to the poor performance of Canadian teams in the 2015–16 season), Sportsnet announced on June 27, 2016, that Stroumboulopoulos had been let go from Rogers, and that Ron MacLean would be reinstated.

===Apple Music===
Starting on August 18, 2020, George Stroumboulopoulos became the host for his new show called STROMBO on the newly created Apple Music Hits radio station on Apple Music&#x27;s live radio. The shows airs Monday to Friday every week at 6:00pm (PST).

He recently partnered with Apple Books to launch the book club &quot;Strombo&#x27;s Lit&quot;.

===Other works===
Stroumboulopoulos has also hosted a highly regarded documentary series of CBC, &quot;Love, Hate &amp; Propaganda&quot; which was based on examining how propaganda affected and lead to shape crucial events that occur in the 20th century. The documentary included War on Terror, Second World War, and the Cold War.

Over the course of his career, George has interviewed multiple sports stars, entertainment icons, and world leaders.

==Charity and public awareness==
Stroumboulopoulos and &quot;The Hour&quot; sponsored the &#x27;One Million Acts of Green&#x27; Internet Website challenge, calling on Canadians to register environmental acts they&#x27;ve done. The campaign registered over 1.6 million acts on the website. George and his family have been devoted to this cause also supported by Dr. David Suzuki.

Stroumboulopoulos is a strong advocate of social issues and has been actively partaking in many global initiatives and involved with numerous charitable initiatives, such as hosting the &#x27;HipHop4Africa&#x27; Mandela Children&#x27;s Fund Canada and CapAids February 2006 Toronto benefit. He has traveled to the Arctic for a special on literacy, youth culture and the loss of Inuit identity. He has been to Sudan with War Child Canada, and Zambia for a World AIDS Day special documentary. He also supports Make Poverty History. He joined other prominent Canadians in sharing views on global issues in the March 2010 issue of &quot;Upstream Journal&quot; magazine.

He was executive producer and co-host of &quot;Canada for Haiti&quot; television with Cheryl Hickey and Ben Mulroney to help the humanitarian crisis in Haiti after a devastating earthquake. He managed to raise over $27 million for the victims of Haitian earthquake.

He also presented at Vancouver&#x27;s EPIC Expo in May 2011 where he showed support for Fair Trade and the work of Fair Trade Vancouver.

<doc id="1086271" wikidata="Q1434215" url="?curid=1086271" title="Pomade">
<text>Pomade is a greasy, waxy, or water-based substance that is used to style hair. It generally gives the user&#x27;s hair a shiny, slick appearance. It lasts longer than most hair-care products, and often requires repeated washes for complete removal. The pomades of the 18th and 19th centuries consisted mainly of bear fat or lard. Lanolin, beeswax and petroleum jelly have been used extensively in modern pomades. The hold of pomades makes sculptured hairstyles such as the pompadour waves (hairstyle) possible.

==Fragrances==
Pomade also refers to a wax extract of fragrant flowers. They preserve the fragrances. Instead of using hot wax as the extractant, fats, such as tallow has been used. Related to pomades are other forms of extracting and preserving fragrances. These include concretes and resinoids.

==Names==
The English word &#x27; derives from French , itself from Italian , from (&quot;apple&quot;) and , used to form related nouns. In the Early Modern Period, pomades were ointments made from various kinds of fat and used to beautify both the skin and face. Mashed apples were added to help perfume the mixture. (The word was also infrequently used as a synonym for apple cider.) Modern pomades may contain fragrances but are usually not particularly fruity. Other English names for the ointment, drink, and hair treatment are pomate and pomatum from , the Medieval Latin form of the same name.

==History==

During the Roman era, soap was used as a pomade by some European tribes. In the 19th century, bear fat was usually the main pomade ingredient. In 1873 UK company Morgan&#x27;s Pomade was established selling Hair Darkening Pomade across the world. By the early 20th century, petroleum jelly, beeswax, and lard were more commonly used. Early 20th century examples of pomades include Murray&#x27;s Superior Pomade (originating in 1925), Sweet Georgia Brown Hair Dressing Pomade (originating in 1934) and Royal Crown Pomade (originating in 1936). Dixie Peach Hair Pomade was popular with teenage boys in the U.S. from World War II through the 1960s.

The concept of pomade can be traced back to ancient times. The ancient Egyptians, for instance, used a substance similar to pomade made from animal fats and other ingredients to style their hair and wigs. This practice was not only about appearance but also about hygiene and protection from the harsh sun.

Pomades were much more popular in the 1920s to 1950s than they are today, although they have made a comeback in the 2010s with recent alternations to the marketplace, which feature not only traditionally manufactured petroleum and oil-based pomades but also modern water-soluble pomades. Compared to oil-based pomades, water-based pomades wash out more easily.

Hairstyles from the 20th and 21st centuries involving the use of pomade include the ducktail, pompadour, and quiff. The Pompadour was a cultural phenomenon in the mid-1950s to 1964 and was worn by young actors and those in the new musical genre, Rock and Roll. Examples can be seen on Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and James Dean. In the 1980s, Rockabilly style Rock and Roll and the pompadour had a resurgence and was worn by musicians such as Brian Setzer and Chris Isaak.

== Modern resurgence ==
The reemergence of popular pomade use coincides with the rise in popularity of the disconnected undercut hairstyle. The hairstyle is characterized by buzzed or faded sides, and a much longer top which is disconnected from the side hairs. The undercut hairstyle was first popularized in the early 20th century as affordable barbershops used the newly invented hair clipper to quickly and cheaply shave the sides of men&#x27;s heads; leaving long top hairs that would be styled with pomade. During the 2010s, the style was featured in many popular period movies, especially World War II films, and in shows such as &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;. Celebrities such as athlete David Beckham and actor Brad Pitt were seen donning this style of hair. 

The heavy hold and slick look of pomade is very well suited to control the long hair of most undercut styles.

Today&#x27;s pomades fall under two main categories with some subcategories, the traditional oil-based pomade and the newer water-based and gel pomades.

Traditional oil-based pomades are generally subdivided into three more groups: heavy hold, medium hold, and light hold. Heavier pomades generally have a higher wax content and better hold their shape throughout the day. The higher wax content usually results in a lower shine pomade. Light holds, sometimes called a brilliantine, have a higher oil content and therefore are usually more shiny. This type of pomade has a wet look and a lower hold. Some prominent modern oil-based pomades are &quot;Reuzel, Lockhart&#x27;s,&quot; and &quot;Murray&#x27;s.&quot; 

The water-based pomades are split between gel-based pomades (Orthodox) and water-based (Unorthodox) pomades. Gel pomades come in different degrees of hold. Firm hold pomades dry much more stiff and are better at holding a particular style. However, they are generally less malleable and can only be restyled during the day by wetting the hair. These pomades generally contain hardening agents such as polyvinyl pyrolidone or vinyl pyrolidone. Some popular gel pomades include &quot;Suavecito&quot;, 
&quot;Layrite&quot; and &quot;Imperial&quot;. 

Unorthodox water-based pomades mimic the malleable qualities of oil-based pomades while still being able to be easily washed out like a gel pomade. Popular unorthodox water-based pomades include &quot;O&#x27;Douds&quot;, &quot;Shear Revival&quot;, &quot;Lockharts&quot;, and &quot;Flagship&quot; pomades.

==Natural versus traditional pomades==
The modern preference for natural hair care solutions has given rise to a reevaluation of traditional pomade formulations. While the word &quot;pomade&quot; has historically been associated with a variety of hair styling products, there has been a notable shift away from products containing petroleum. This movement has been driven by an increasing awareness of the problems associated with petroleum-based hair products and a growing demand for natural hair care alternatives that are both safe and effective for users.

Traditional pomades, often petroleum-based, have been found to possess certain qualities that can be detrimental to the hair and scalp health of consumers. A primary issue lies in their tendency to cause buildup, leading to clogged hair follicles, which can impede hair growth and result in scalp ailments. Furthermore, the presence of certain petroleum derivatives has raised concerns over their potential health risks, including the risk of irritation and more serious consequences from prolonged use.

In contrast, natural pomades are typically made from a blend of ingredients like shea butter, beeswax, and a variety of nourishing oils. These ingredients offer a stark difference in both intention and effect, aiming to provide nutrients and support for the hair and scalp, instead of merely offering styling hold. The benefits of natural ingredients over petroleum extend beyond avoiding negative side effects—they often contribute positively to the overall condition of the hair, promoting moisture retention and a healthy scalp environment.

The resurgence of natural hair grease reflects a broader consumer shift towards products that not only perform well but also align with a health-conscious lifestyle and ethical consumerism. As awareness and education about the benefits of natural hair care ingredients grow, so does the popularity of these safer, more beneficial alternatives in hair styling routines.

<doc id="1086286" wikidata="Q301792" url="?curid=1086286" title="Amanita fulva">
<text>Amanita fulva, commonly called the tawny grisette or the orange-brown ringless amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom of the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;. It is found frequently in deciduous and coniferous forests of Europe, and possibly North America.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Amanita fulva&quot; was first described by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774. Historically, both the tawny grisette and the grisette (&quot;A. vaginata&quot;) were placed in the genus &quot;Amanitopsis&quot; due to their lack of a ring, unlike other &quot;Amanita&quot; species. However this distinction is now seen as insufficient to warrant a separate genus. Today, &quot;A. fulva&quot; and similar ringless species of &quot;Amanita&quot; are placed in the section &quot;Vaginatae&quot; ss according to the classification of Bas.

==Description==

The cap is orange-brown, paler towards the margin, and darker (even very dark brown) in the center, up to in diameter. It develops an umbo when expanded, and has a strongly striated margin. Its surface is smooth, slightly sticky and slippery when moist and glistens; later it may dry. The gills are free, close, and broad. The flesh is white to cream. The stem or stipe is white and smooth or powdery, sometimes tinged with orange-brown and with very fine hairs. It is slender, ringless, hollow and quite fragile, tapering towards the top; up to 15 cm tall and 1–1.5 cm in thickness. The universal veil which initially encapsulates the fruiting body is torn and develops into a white, sack-like volva with characteristic rusty-brown blemishes. The cap is usually free of volval remnants. Infrequently, roughly polygonal pieces of the veil may remain on the surface.

The spores are white, 9 × 12 μm or (9.0-) 10.0–12.5 (-19.3) x (8.2-) 9.3–12.0 (-15.5) μm in size, globose; nonamyloid.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Amanita fulva&quot;, distributed throughout Europe, occurs in a variety of forests. It is generally found with oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;), birch (&quot;Betula&quot;), spruce (&quot;Picea&quot;), pine (&quot;Pinus&quot;), chestnut (&quot;Castanea&quot;) and alder (&quot;Alnus&quot;), with which it forms mycorrhizae. It is often found with birch in Scandinavia, while collections from southern Europe are usually from forests of oak, chestnut and pine. It grows in acidic soils and fruits from summer to late autumn (May to November in the UK). It is a common to scarce fungus, and is very common in Britain.

&quot;Amanita fulva&quot; is considered to be widely distributed in North America in deciduous and coniferous forests, although collections could possibly be of a different, yet undescribed species. In addition, the name &quot;Amanita fulva&quot; has in the past been misapplied to other North American taxa, such as &quot;A. amerifulva&quot; and others.

==Edibility==
&quot;Amanita fulva&quot; is one of the few good edible species in its genus. Though this particular species is considered edible, it must be identified with care as other members of the genus &quot;Amanita&quot; are poisonous and some are deadly. For this reason, consuming &quot;A. fulva&quot; can be dangerous and is not recommended. It is potentially toxic when raw and suitable for consumption only after cooking.

<doc id="1086289" wikidata="Q7890847" url="?curid=1086289" title="United States Office of Personnel Management">
<text>The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is an independent agency of the United States government that manages the United States federal civil service. The agency provides federal human resources policy, oversight, and support, and tends to healthcare (FEHB), life insurance (FEGLI), and retirement benefits (CSRS and FERS, but not TSP) for federal government employees, retirees, and their dependents.

OPM is headed by a director, who is nominated by the president. As of January 20, 2025, Charles Ezell is acting director.

==History==
The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 created OPM&#x27;s predecessor, the United States Civil Service Commission. On January 1, 1979, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978 took effect, dissolving the Commission and assigning most of its former functions—except the federal employees appellate function—to new agencies, with most assigned to the newly created U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) (, ).

The United States Office of Government Ethics, responsible for directing executive branch policies relating to the prevention of conflicts of interest on the part of federal executive branch officers and employees, was part of OPM until being spun off as an independent agency in 1989.

In 1996, OPM&#x27;s investigation branch was privatized, and USIS was formed. In 2014, after several scandals, OPM declined to renew its contract with USIS and brought background investigations back in house under the short-lived National Background Investigations Bureau. In 2019, responsibility for conducting federal background checks changed hands again when NBIB was dissolved and its functions were given to the Defense Security Service, part of the Department of Defense, which was reorganized into the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency for the purpose.

===Obama-era reform efforts===
In July 2013, Representative Blake Farenthold introduced the Office of Personnel Management Inspector General Act. The bill would increase oversight of OPM&#x27;s revolving fund. Farenthold introduced the bill as a response to accusations of fraud and concern about security clearance background investigations. The bill would fund the expenses for investigations, oversight activities, and audits from the revolving fund. The bill was in response to a discovery that between 2002 and 2012, OPM&#x27;s revolving fund had tripled, totaling over $2 billion, or 90% of OPM&#x27;s budget. In February 2014, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. The fund&#x27;s history dates to the early 1980s, where it was used for two main activities: training and background investigations for government personnel.

===2015 data breach===

In April 2015, hackers working on behalf of the Jiangsu State Security Department, a provincial branch of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, obtained access to 22.1 million SF-86 records of U.S. federal employees, contractors, and their friends and family. In one of the largest breaches of government data in U.S. history, information that was obtained and exfiltrated in the breach included personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers, names, dates and places of birth, and addresses.

New information about this security breach came to light on September 24, 2015. The agency then indicated that additional evidence showed that 5.6 million people&#x27;s fingerprints were stolen as part of the hacks, more than five times the 1.1 million originally estimated. The total number of people whose records were disclosed in whole or part, including Social Security numbers and addresses, remained at 21.5 million.

===First Trump administration proposal to merge into GSA===
Between 2018 and 2019, as part of a larger initiative to restructure the executive branch, President Donald Trump submitted a proposal to congress to merge OPM into the General Services Administration (GSA) while returning the federal personnel policy-making components under the direct authority of the Executive Office of the President of the United States to the Office of Management and Budget in the White House. Representative Gerry Connolly, chair of the Subcommittee on Government Operations under the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, fiercely criticized the proposal. During a congressional hearing, Connolly said: &quot;The administration wants to take over the merit policy-making functions and put them into the highly politicized environment of the White House itself, away from direct congressional oversight and inspector general review.&quot; Political pressure against the proposal peaked when a provision barring the president from transferring any function, responsibility, authority, service, system, or program until six months after the completion of an &quot;independent report&quot; by the federally chartered National Academy of Public Administration was added to the 1,120 page bill S-1790, a.k.a. the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.

===Second Trump administration workforce restructuring and security concerns===
To reduce the federal workforce, Trump established the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on January 20, 2025, and appointed Elon Musk as its leader. DOGE is leveraging OPM&#x27;s authority and influence to execute the Trump administration&#x27;s initiatives for restructuring the federal workforce.

Charles Ezell, OPM&#x27;s acting director, has been issuing guidance and memos to implement Trump&#x27;s executive orders, including his January 27 memorandum regarding Schedule F. This aligns closely with DOGE&#x27;s objectives and workforce restructuring plans.

Other efforts in line with DOGE&#x27;s goals include revising telework policies, considering the termination of recently hired federal employees, and instructing agencies to bypass certain regulations.

====Deferred resignation program====

In January 2025, the OPM launched a controversial &quot;deferred resignation&quot; program, offering federal employees the option to resign effective September 30, 2025, while continuing to receive pay and benefits until that date. The program was announced in an email headed &quot;Fork in the Road&quot;, framed as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reduce the federal workforce.

The proposal faced immediate backlash from federal employees and unions. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) warned workers not to accept the offer, citing concerns over potential benefit disputes and unclear legal protections. Legal experts also raised concerns about the program&#x27;s unprecedented nature, questioning its compliance with federal employment laws.

====Musk&#x27;s aides and congressional oversight====
According to &quot;Reuters&quot;, on January 20, Musk&#x27;s team took control of OPM&#x27;s headquarters. By January 31, it had revoked the access of several OPM senior career civil servants, blocking them from key government computer systems. This included access to the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, a comprehensive database storing sensitive information such as government employees&#x27; dates of birth, Social Security numbers, performance appraisals, and home addresses. Concerns were raised about lack of congressional oversight at OPM.

&quot;Wired&quot; reported that a group of six engineers aged between 18 and 24 who previously worked for Musk were overseeing significant U.S. government roles, particularly the OPM and DOGE. This development came as Musk&#x27;s influence expands into federal agencies under the Trump administration&#x27;s initiatives to reshape the federal workforce. Government watchdogs and unions have raised concerns about inexperienced peopleone of whom recently graduated from high schoolaltering federal policies and operations.

Government watchdogs and lawmakers have demanded transparency, questioning whether Musk&#x27;s associates had legal authority to oversee federal operations. The involvement of outsiders in federal decision-making raised ethics and security concerns, particularly as the administration pushed significant workforce reductions.

====Cybersecurity lawsuit over newly deployed email servers====
Simultaneously, OPM faced scrutiny over a newly deployed email system designed to send mass communications to federal employees. A lawsuit filed by two anonymous federal workers alleged that OPM failed to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) before launching the system, potentially exposing sensitive government communications.

Critics warned that the system lacked basic encryption protections, making it vulnerable to spoofing, phishing, and unauthorized access. Some federal IT departments reportedly advised employees to flag all messages from the new system as potential phishing attempts due to authentication concerns.

The cybersecurity controversy further exacerbated concerns over OPM&#x27;s security posture, especially given the agency&#x27;s history with the 2015 OPM data breach, which compromised over 21 million federal employees&#x27; personal records. As of early 2025, OPM had not confirmed whether the vulnerabilities had been mitigated, and the lawsuit remained ongoing.

==== Requirement for employees to report accomplishments ====
On February 22, 2025, the OPM sent an email to all federal employees, asking them to respond with &quot;what you accomplished last week&quot; by midnight EST on February 24. Shortly before the email went out, Musk posted about it on X, saying that &quot;Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.&quot; A claim that this action was unlawful was added to a pending lawsuit against the OPM for the mass layoffs of probationary workers. Some agencies instructed their employees not to respond to the email. On February 24, the OPM announced that employees were not required to respond to the email.

==Function==
According to its website, OPM&#x27;s mission is &quot;recruiting, retaining and honoring a world-class force to serve the American people.&quot; OPM is partially responsible for maintaining the appearance of independence and neutrality in the administrative law system. While technically employees of the agencies they work for, administrative law judges (ALJs) are hired exclusively by OPM, effectively removing any discretionary employment procedures from other agencies. OPM uses a rigorous selection process that ranks the top three candidates for each ALJ vacancy and then selects from those candidates, generally giving preference to veterans.

OPM is also responsible for federal employee retirement applications for FERS and CSRS employees. OPM makes decisions on federal employee regular and disability retirement cases. OPM also oversees FEHB and FEGLI, the health insurance and life insurance programs for federal employees. But it does not oversee TSP, which is handled by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), a separate independent agency.

At an underground limestone mine in Boyers, Pennsylvania, federal employees&#x27; retirements are processed on paper by hand, and the information is stored in file cabinets. On average, it takes 61 days to process a retirement.

<doc id="1086295" wikidata="Q229810" url="?curid=1086295" title="Josephine of Leuchtenberg">
<text>Josephine of Leuchtenberg (Joséphine Maximilienne Eugénie Napoléone de Beauharnais; 14 March 1807 – 7 June 1876), also Josefina, was Queen of Sweden and Norway from 8 March 1844 to 8 July 1859 as the wife of King Oscar I. She was also Princess of Bologna from birth and Duchess of Galliera from 1813. She was regarded as politically active during the reign of her spouse and acted as his political adviser, actively participating in government affairs. She is acknowledged as having introduced more liberal laws regarding religion.

==Early life==
Joséphine was born on 14 March 1807 in Milan, Italy. She was the first of six children of Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg (1781–1824), and his wife, Princess Augusta of Bavaria (1788–1851). Her paternal grandmother and namesake was Joséphine Tascher de La Pagerie, the first wife of Napoleon; she was given the name &#x27;Joséphine&#x27; by Napoleon&#x27;s request. Her maternal grandfather was King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria.

At birth, she was given the title &quot;Princess of Bologna&quot; by Napoleon, and later she was also made Duchess of Galliera. She spent her first seven years in Italy. The family spent their days in Villa Bonaparte in Milan and at their summer residence in Monza outside Milan. In 1812, they received a visit from the former Empress Joséphine. In 1813, her father Eugène turned down the offer from his father-in-law to join the forces against Napoleon. In 1814, Augusta joined her father at his military headquarters at Mantua, where she gave birth to Théodolinde de Beauharnais, Joséphine&#x27;s youngest sister. A little later, Joséphine and her siblings joined their mother in the fortress at Mantua in a procession of carriages with their courtiers. After the defeat of Napoleon that same year, her parents left for her maternal grandfather in Bavaria, and a little later, Joséphine and her siblings followed them in the company of Baron Darnay, earlier her father&#x27;s secretary. Reportedly, this was a memory that stayed with Joséphine. Her father was given the title Duke of Leuchtenberg and the former principality of Eichstätt in Bavaria as a fief. Her childhood is described as happy. The family spent their summers at Eichstätt and their winters in Munich with Augusta&#x27;s family.

==Education==
Joséphine could speak French, German and Italian and studied history and geography with Professor Le Sage; botany and natural science with Professor Martinus; mathematics, physics and astronomy with Professor Siebers.

==Marriage to the Crown Prince of Sweden and Norway==
Charles XIV John of Sweden feared the legitimist policy of the Congress of Vienna, and wished to give the House of Bernadotte connections through blood with old royal dynasties of Europe. The marriage of his son and heir to the throne, Crown Prince Oscar, was the solution to this problem, and in 1822, he finally forced his son to agree to marry and to make a trip to Europe to inspect a list of potential candidates for the position of Crown Princess and Queen. In this list, a Princess of Denmark was the first alternative; a Princess of Leuchtenberg was the second; a Princess of Hesse was the third and a Princess of Weimar was the fourth. Charles XIV John had chosen Josephine of Leuchtenberg as candidate number two, because she had connections both to the old dynasties of Europe through her mother, and to the House of Bonaparte through her father, and thus, she &quot;joined the new interests with the old&quot;, as he expressed the matter.

===Engagement and wedding===

Crown Prince Oscar declined marriage to a Danish Princess, but expressed his interest in the Princess of Leuchtenberg after his first meeting with Joséphine on 23 August 1822 in Eichstätt. The couple reportedly developed a mutual attraction and fell in love when they saw each other, and therefore, the marriage was accepted by both families and duly arranged. Joséphine took lessons in the Swedish language and corresponded with Oscar until the wedding. Her father was reportedly not against her conversion to Lutheranism, but the Swedish representatives had apparently thought it necessary to offer her the option to keep her religion. Although she was a devout Catholic, she agreed to raise her children in the Lutheran religion. She brought a Catholic priest, and regularly attended mass and confession in her private Catholic chapel. The Pope had given his consent to this. In Sweden, the law of 1781, &quot;Toleransediktet&quot;, declared freedom of religion for foreigners and immigrants, and Joséphine, as well as her mother-in-law Désirée, could be regarded as such. For Swedes, however, the conversion from the Lutheran Church to another religion formally meant confiscation of property and banishment from the country. The situation in Norway was similar. The Lutheran clergy was against the match, but the King had his way.

Princess Joséphine married the Crown Prince by proxy at the Palais Leuchtenberg in Munich on 22 May 1823. They also conducted a wedding ceremony in person on 19 June 1823 in Stockholm, Sweden. The first wedding ceremony was Catholic, and the second wedding ceremony was Lutheran. Through her mother (her maternal line of Hesse and upward through Hanau and Ansbach, Baden-Durlach and Kleeburg), Joséphine was a descendant of Charles IX of Sweden through a sister of Charles X Gustav of Sweden, making her children descendants of Gustav Vasa. Through her maternal grandfather, Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, she was also one of the descendants of Renata of Lorraine, granddaughter of Christian II of Denmark.

Josephine arrived in Sweden in the company of her mother-in-law, Queen Desideria, who had been absent for eleven years. They arrived in Manilla outside Stockholm 13 June 1823, where they were welcomed by King Charles XIV John, Crown Prince Oscar, military salutes and great crowds, and escorted to Haga Palace, where Josephine was embraced by Princess Sophia Albertina, Abbess of Quedlinburg. The second wedding ceremony took place six days later. Six days after her arrival in Sweden, her middle name &#x27;Napoléonne&#x27; was removed. This was because Sweden had fought against Bonaparte in the recent war. She had brought with her several pieces of exclusive jewelry made in Paris for her paternal grandmother, which are still among the possessions of the Royal Houses of Sweden, Denmark and Norway (via Louise and Märtha of Sweden). In Sweden, she was known by the Swedish version of her name: &quot;Josefina&quot;. In her retinue, she brought with her Bertha Zück, who she made her treasurer, and her Catholic confessor Jacob Lorenz Studach: until their death, they enjoyed such a close relationship that they were referred to as &quot;The Trio&quot;. Josephine was escorted to Sweden by a temporary lady-in-waiting, Countess Aurora Wilhelmina Brahe, but once arrived, Countess Elisabet Charlotta Piper and, from 1836, Countess Charlotta Skjöldebrand served as her &quot;Överhovmästarinna&quot; or senior lady-in-waiting.

==Crown Princess==
Josephine was a social success in Sweden from the moment of her arrival, both as a private person in the circles of high society as well as a public person, and was to become more popular as Queen than her predecessor and successor. Already as Crown Princess, she was able to play the representational part that her mother-in-law was not able to fulfill, and she played a great role in making the new dynasty popular in Sweden. In the summer of 1824, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess visited Christiania in Norway, where they engaged in many public appearances to make the monarchy popular. Oscar had been given the task of temporary Viceroy during his visit, and Josephine was present in a box when he appeared before the Storting. After this, they made a trip through Sweden to present her to the public. She was described as charming, beautiful and dignified, and she was also regarded as gifted: she impressed by being able to speak the Swedish language almost fluently at her arrival. At a ball in 1838 Fritz von Dardel described her: &quot;As for the Crown Princess, she was beautiful and dignified, perhaps too thin but very intelligent and quite delightful toward all. No one has anything to reproach her for other than for her Catholic religion.&quot;

Her relationship to her father-in-law was very warm. The King treated her with great affection and, for example, used to hide sweets in his pockets, which she searched through and, at one occasion, found a jewel hidden in a sweet. On 21 August 1823, Charles XIV John declared that this day, the same date he had been elected Crown Prince, should be the name day for Josephine, and henceforth be celebrated as Josephine-Day. The first such celebration took place that day at Drottningholm Palace, and Josephine Day was celebrated in Sweden for decades after that: it became a tradition for the public in Stockholm to travel to Drottningholm Palace at that day, where festivities had been arranged for them, and cheer for Josephine, who greeted them from a balcony. 
Her relationship with her mother-in-law, however, was somewhat tense during the first years, as Queen Désirée reportedly felt neglected by her spouse, and that her place as a Queen was overshadowed by Josephine&#x27;s popularity. After the initial years, however, the relationship between Josephine and Désirée became more friendly and harmonious.

The relationship between Josephine and Oscar was initially described as a mutually happy one, and the couple shared their interests in culture, painting, writing and singing. Oscar and Josephine had five children, of whom two were to become kings of Sweden and Norway. However, Oscar was known for his extramarital affairs, a fact that deeply tormented Josephine, who suffered from jealousy. Oscar was to resume his contact with Jacquette Löwenhielm after the wedding, though Josephine is initially not believed to have been aware of this: however, in 1826, she gave the first signs of being aware of his affairs in her diary, and in 1828, she wrote of painful suspicions of adultery and also that it pained her to be constantly pregnant. In 1832, a year after the birth of her last child, she wrote in her diary about the contemporary view that a woman was expected to endure a husband&#x27;s extramarital affairs: &quot;A woman should suffer in silence&quot;, and that she found this contemporary view unjust. In 1835, her pain over Oscar&#x27;s behavior caused her to take a trip to the spa Medevi to calm her nerves. Her husband&#x27;s relationship with the famed actress Emilie Högquist was well known. It was also not a temporary affair, but a serious relationship, which began in 1836 and resulted in two sons: Max in 1839 and Hjalmar in 1840. In 1837, Oscar and Emilie Högquist met in Bad Ems. Josephine described the years of Oscar&#x27;s relationship with Emilie Högquist as a walk &quot;through fire&quot;. Josephine and Oscar, however, continued to appear together in public, and her dignified behavior placed the sympathies on her side. Oscar became unpopular because of it, and King Charles XIV John reprimanded him for it out of sympathy for Josephine&#x27;s suffering. During her later years as Crown Princess, this situation, which contributed to a conflict between the monarch and the Crown Prince, introduced Josephine to politics as she became active as a mediator between her spouse and her father-in-law.

Josephine was interested in gardening and painting. Her interest in art was active and genuine. She supported the career of the painter (and Catholic convert) Sofia Adlersparre, and also encouraged the artistic interest and talent of her own daughter, Princess Eugénie, who became a talented amateur artist. In 1836, she received a visit from her mother and her brother and two sisters. In 1843, she visited her mother in Munich.

Josephine was very much involved in social reforms and philanthropy. At her arrival in Sweden, she formed a close relationship with Princess Sophia Albertine of Sweden, who introduced her to this work by engaging her in &quot;Välgörande Fruntimmerssällskapet&quot; (The Charitable Women&#x27;s Society) for the support of poor women. After the death of Sophia Albertine, she took over the protection of this organization, as she would do for the charity organizations of Queen Désirée and her daughter-in-law Queen Louise after their deaths. She also founded several charitable organizations herself. Already as a Crown Princess, she received petitioners asking for help twice a week, and her activity expanded over the years. Her main focus was the support of poor women and children. She founded the &quot;Sällskapet de fattigas vänner&quot; (&#x27;Friends of the Poor Society&#x27;) for poor widows in 1826; &quot;Sällskapet för uppmuntran av öm och sedlig modersvård&quot; (&#x27;Society for Tender and Proper Motherly care&#x27;) for the support of poor mothers in 1827; &quot;Sällskapet för arbetsamhetens uppmuntran&quot; (&#x27;Society for Work Encouagement&#x27;), an employment agency for women in 1833; and &quot;Kronprinsessans slöjdskola för fattiga flickor&quot; (&#x27;The Crown Princess&#x27;s Handcrafts School for Poor Girls&#x27;). . Josephine, though deeply religious and influenced by the Christian idea of charity, did not believe it to be the task of religion but of the state to provide welfare, and she kept the two issues separate in her charity work. In her library, there were works about early Christian socialism, which appear to have been thoroughly read.

Josephine had her own Catholic chapel at the Royal Palace. Privately, she is known to have tried to influence her mother-in-law to be more than a Catholic in name only: in 1844, her confessor stated that she had managed to convince her mother-in-law to attend confession for the first time in fifty years. Oscar always supported her religious rights, regardless of their personal relationship. As for the children, she could not interfere in their religion, however, she did speak with them of religion: she and her confessor sorted out everything they could find mutual in Catholicism and Lutheranism, and about these things, she felt free to talk about with her children without interfering.

Josephine took a great interest in Catholicism in Sweden and Norway. Upon her arrival, she found the Catholic congregation in Stockholm to be neglected. Among other things, it did not have a proper church building, and she felt that the current Catholic priest, Jean Baptiste Gridaine, who was also the confessor of her mother-in-law, damaged the reputation of the Catholics because of it. Upon the death of Gridaine in 1833, he was replaced by her own confessor Studach. 16 September 1837, the Sankta Eugenia Church in Stockholm was founded in her presence, the effort of her and Studach&#x27;s work: this was the first Catholic church in Scandinavia since the Reformation, and became the first apostolic vicariate in Scandinavia: Norway was incorporated in 1841. She attended mass there herself on Sundays.

==Queen of Sweden and Norway==

In 1844, Josephine became Queen of Sweden and Norway at the accession of her spouse. She was crowned in Sweden 28 September 1844. There had been some opposition: the religious debate was more heated in the 1840s than it had been in 1829, when Queen Desideria had been crowned, but Oscar solved the matter by declaring that he would not be crowned himself if she was not. In Norway, there was more serious opposition to the coronation of a Catholic. The official reason was that the ceremony was unnecessary, as the queen had no position in the Norwegian constitution, but it is acknowledged that the real reason was her religion: Queen Desideria had in fact not been crowned in Norway either. Because of this, Oscar refused to be crowned in Norway as well.

At the time Josephine became queen, Fredrika Bremer wrote of her, that she: &quot;... prefers to act out of her own pulse and will. Granted, I have not heard this from court, but I believe it to be the truth. Out of the two royal spouses, she is, without question, believed to be the stronger character.&quot; After Oscar ascended to the throne, he discontinued extramarital affairs. The relationship between Josephine and Oscar was repaired, and continued to be good during his reign and until his death. The degree of her political influence during the reign of Oscar is debated. She was said to have acted as his adviser and to have exerted influence in several matters. Reportedly, Oscar felt pressured by his responsibility, and relied upon her support. It is confirmed that, when a crisis occurred, the king and the queen withdrew in private to discuss the matter before the king made a decision. Their private conferences were witnessed by the curious court, who could sometimes observe them discussing the matter in the palace garden out of hearing range.

Foreign policy can be seen to have been affected by her sympathies and views. In her correspondence with her aunt, the Prussian queen Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria, it is evident that she actively negotiated for peace in the First Schleswig War of 1848. During the war, she informed her aunt that Sweden had decided to assist Denmark against Prussia to defend its independence, and that she hoped that Prussia would be willing to engage in peace negotiations. The result was that Prussia had Count Albert von Pourtalès sent to Sweden to enter in peace negotiations with Josephine personally. In parallel, she assured the Queen and King of Prussia of her personal regard and offered them a safe haven if they should ever be forced out of Prussia. She is confirmed to have played an important part in the secret diplomacy of Oscar I, where she also promoted her younger son, Oscar, before her elder son Charles. Her contact with Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie of the French is regarded to have been of certain importance during the 1850s European crisis. Josephine was by referred to as pro-French and anti-Russian. She was pointed out, among others by her son, Charles, to have been responsible for the November treaty between Sweden-Norway, France and Great Britain against Russian expansionism in 1855. 
Josephine is thought to have been the instigator of the laws providing equal inheritance for men and women in 1845, reforms in the prisons and social care, and the abolition of the guilds in 1846. During the European Revolutions of 1848, riots broke out in Stockholm 19 March 1848, called &quot;Marsoroligheterna&quot;, and continued for four days. Rebels on the streets demanded a Republic and tried to cause an armed rebellion. The royal family was, according to Count Löwenhielm, pale and seriously worried when he visited them at the time. Josephine reportedly asked Oscar not to fire at the crowds during the riots. Eventually, however, the riots were subdued with fire by the military. With the exception of suspicion in the religious question, however, Josephine&#x27;s involvement in politics does not appear to have been ill-regarded, but rather she was considered as a good influence.

Her Catholicism was the only thing which somewhat affected her popularity within some circles of society. Her religion combined with her reputed political activity caused rumours that she exerted undue influence in regards to religious issues. By the 1840s, there was an intense political debate about freedom of religion, which in parallel caused more anti-Catholicism in a country where the attitude had previously been indifferent, and this exposed Josephine more or less direct attacks in the press. She did in fact use her influence for the benefit of the Catholics, and she cooperated with Pope Gregory XVI in this issue. Josephine is believed to have been behind several laws regarding the religious policies. From 1851, she supported the first female Catholic order to be active in Sweden since the reformation, when the nuns of the Filles du Coer de Marie established themselves in Stockholm to take care of the Catholic children&#x27;s schooling. In 1853–1854, Swedish Lutherans were given the permission to attend Catholic sermons.

In 1853, there was a case where six Swedish women were reported to have converted to the Catholic faith. Josephine, who was at the time working to introduce freedom of religion, asked Oscar to convince the minister of religion to postpone the investigation against the women. This was also done. In 1856, Oscar expressed himself in favor of freedom of religion. However, in 1857, Oscar became ill and incapacitated, and Crown Prince Charles became regent. Charles, who was anti-Catholic, worked against his mother&#x27;s plans, and used the help of people such as the vicar Nils Johan Ekdahl, who belonged to the opponents of the Queen because of her religion and political influence. Ekdahl preached during this time, that as there had been no tolerance for Queen Christina of Sweden, who had been a Swede and a queen regnant and converted to Catholicism: &quot;...so much less would it be for a foreign Queen, who entered the nation by marriage&quot;. The six female converts were put on trial in 1858, after which they were banished and had their property was confiscated. However, by that time, that old law was considered to shame the reputation of Sweden and the banishment a scandal, and in 1860, Charles saw himself obliged to finally introduce freedom of religion. The female converts, who emigrated to Lyon in France, returned to Sweden after the introduction of freedom of religion.

Josephine was also Queen of Norway. She reportedly appreciated the Norwegian nature as it reminded her of Bavaria. She greatly influenced the interior of the Royal Palace in Christiania, which was completed in 1849, took an interest in Norwegian art and often visited art exhibitions in Christiania. The Oscarshall Palace was reportedly mostly inspired by her.

The year of 1852 has been described as hard for her: in the company of her husband, daughter Princess Eugénie and son Prince Gustaf, Duke of Uppland, she visited her mother on her death bed in Bavaria. On their way back, they visited Norway, where Gustaf died of pneumonia. In 1856, she had St. Olav Church (now St. Olav&#x27;s Cathedral), the first Catholic Church since reformation, ignited in Christiania in Norway.

She had a tense relationship with her eldest son. Charles had been deeply in love with her maid of honor Sigrid Sparre. This had happened during the same time when negotiations were being conducted to marry Charles to Louise of Prussia in 1846. Josephine had separated Charles and Sparre by expelling Sparre from court in 1848, though she did not manage to save the marriage alliance with Prussia. Charles never forgave Josephine for separating him from Sparre, and further more, it also caused him to be strongly anti-Catholic, because he blamed his mother&#x27;s decision on her Catholic confessor Jacob Lorenz Studach. Josephine also disliked Charles for being impulsive, economically irresponsible and morally loose. In 1852, the first time Charles served as regent, during the royal couple&#x27;s trip to Germany, it was noted that she said farewell to Charles and his advisers with the remark: &quot;Well, now we will leave, and the gentlemen will rule...&quot;, a comment perceived as cold and skeptical.

In 1857, Oscar I became ill. The illness of the monarch made it necessary for a regency, and crown prince Charles was seen as the obvious choice. Queen Josephine opposed Charles being appointed regent during the incapacity of the King. The rumors claimed that the reason was that she was aware of the fact that Charles would never allow her any influence on the affairs of state. During this time, there is a known occasion, which attracted attention. The King and the Queen showed themselves to the public in the capital in their carriage. At this point, the King was too weak to wave, but Josephine did in fact hold and moved his hand in a wave. She also nudged him to make him aware of what was happening. This caused rumors that she was afraid to lose her political position. Mathilda d&#x27;Orozco described this view in a contemporary letter where she defended the queen against it: &quot;She is pushing the King, it is said, the poor thing, to make him greet people, when they are out. She is guarding him, not as an angel of mercy, not as a slave of duty, a martyr - no, as a virago, concerned only for her reign. This is so hard, so ungrateful...&quot; In the autumn of 1857, she was forced to accept the appointment of Charles as regent. She gave him her appreciation for the advisers he had chosen, but this also meant the end of her political activity. Queen Josephine was admired for her selfless nursing of him the two years he was ill before his death.

==Queen dowager==
In 1859, Oscar died, thereby making Josephine queen dowager; although she was only officially titled as such in the late 1860s, when her mother-in-law, Queen Dowager Désirée, died. It is noted, that she followed the French tradition by wearing violet as a mourning colour rather than black: violet was her favourite colour in any event, and she would wear it for the rest of her life. As queen dowager, she lost all political influence and devoted herself to her charitable activities and her interest in the Catholic congregation and its issues.

Charles XV considered her too old fashioned and formal and their views were seldom shared. Charles XV made himself known for a decadent life style: he was rumored to engage in Oriental debaucheries with the Armenian Ohan Demirgian, and his life at the summer residence Ulriksdal Palace was compared to that at Versailles, which brought the crown in disrepute, something which had also been Josephine&#x27;s fear. Her relationship with Queen Louise has been described as very good. In 1866, she shared the royal couple&#x27;s negative views about the parliamentary reform. Queen Dowager Josephine was known for acting as nurse during illness in the family, and her relationship with Charles improved in his last years, when his health deteriorated and he became a Freemason and thereafter saw fewer differences in Catholicism and Protestantism.

Josephine kept informed about the political events, though she could no longer affect them. In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, she supported Austria against Prussia, whose expansionism she feared. In 1870, Josephine expressed how deeply she felt against the introduction of the new Catholic doctrine of Papal infallibility. She regarded this as a doctrine which would in high degree repulse the Catholic church in the eyes of the Protestant world. She reportedly suffered when her cousin Emperor Napoleon III of France was dethroned in 1870. After the Battle of Sedan, she assured the imprisoned Napoleon III that she would never forget that she was a member of the Beauharnais family. She invited the son of Napoleon III, the Prince Imperial, to Sweden, though he did not accept the invitation. She also expressed dislike of the annexation of the Papal States, and called 1870 a terrible year. Josephine nursed her daughter-in-law Queen Louise at her death bed in 1871.

In 1872, Charles XV died, and Josephine&#x27;s younger son Oscar II succeeded to the throne. At the time of Charles&#x27; death, Josephine was on a trip to see her sister, Amélie, former Empress of Brazil, in Portugal. On the way, she visited Paris and saw King Amadeo I and Queen Maria Vittoria of Spain in El Escorial. In Lisbon, her dying sister wished for her to see the Sintra National Palace and Monserrate Palace before her return. She returned to Sweden two days after the death of Charles. Upon the death of Jacob Lorenz Studach in 1873, Josephine negotiated with the Pope about who would be the most suitable replacement for missionary Bishop of the Catholic Church in Scandinavia. She wished to have the Bishop of Speyer, Bonifatius von Haneberg. The Pope however appointed Johann Georg Huber.

Josephine supported the first post-reformation Catholic Churches in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1862 and in Bergen, Norway in 1866. In 1865, she supported the foundation of the Catholic school of the nuns of the order of Saint Joseph of Chambéry in Oslo. She founded Stiftelsen Konung Oscar I:s minne (The Foundation of the Memory of Oscar I), a home and asylum for poor married women in 1873 and Stiftelsen Josephinahemmet (The Josephine Home Foundation) a home for poor Catholics in 1873: both these institutions were managed by the nuns of the German Order of Saint Elisabeth.

On 13 June 1873, Josephine celebrated what has been called the second biggest celebration of her life, when she received the public&#x27;s adoration during the celebration of her fifty years in Sweden. She was reportedly very moved, and her own words in a letter are often quoted: &quot;This was a day of a half a century, that I shall never forget until my dying day: my heart will always keep it in fond memory... at last, my dearest friend, have I with movement witnessed, how &quot;Protestant&quot; Sweden so unanimously celebrated a Catholic Queen. I thank and praise God for it...&quot;

In 1875, she visited Pope Pius IX in Rome, a pilgrimage she had long wished to make. She traveled incognito under the name &#x27;Countess of Tullgarn&#x27; and in the company of only four courtiers. On 22 May 1875 she reached Rome after Berlin, Munich and Innsbruck, and received King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, and was guided by him through town. She had a long history of contact with the Pope regarding her Catholic work in Scandinavia, and the Pope had in 1852 contemplated awarding her the Golden Rose, but refrained because he was afraid that this would be ill perceived in a Protestant country. 3 June 1875, Josephine was given communion by the Pope followed by a public dinner, alongside her niece Princess Mathilde Viano and her maid of honor Rosalie Muffat, who was the first non-royal woman to have done both. After Rome, she visited Naples, Bologna and Milan and saw former Empress Eugénie of France in Salzburg.

==Death==
Queen Josephine died in Stockholm in 1876 at the age of 69 and received a Catholic burial. Her last words were: &quot;I am going home now. I am very happy.&quot;

<text>Bingen am Rhein () is a town in the Mainz-Bingen district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

The settlement&#x27;s original name was Bingium, a Celtic word that may have meant &quot;hole in the rock&quot;, a description of the shoal behind the Mouse Tower (German: &quot;Mäuseturm&quot;), known as the &quot;Binger Loch&quot;. Bingen was the starting point for the &quot;Via Ausonia&quot;, a Roman military road that linked the town with Trier. Bingen is well known for, among other things, the legend about the Mouse Tower, in which Hatto II, the Archbishop of Mainz, was allegedly eaten by mice. Since the 19th century, the legend has increasingly been attributed to Hatto I, a predecessor of Hatto II. Saint Hildegard von Bingen, an important polymath, abbess, mystic and musician, one of the most influential medieval composers and one of the earliest Western composers whose music is widely preserved and performed, was born 40 km away from Bingen, in Bermersheim vor der Höhe. Bingen am Rhein was also the birthplace of the poet Stefan George, along with many other influential figures.

==Geography==

===Location===
Bingen is situated just southeast of the Rhine knee by the Bingen Forest (&quot;Binger Wald&quot; – actually a low mountain range), which rises west of the town. Rising to the north on the other side of the Rhine is the Rheingau range, the Taunus&#x27;s southwesternmost outcrop. In Bingen the river Nahe empties into the Rhine Gorge. Bingen forms the southern limit of the UNESCO Rhine Gorge World Heritage Site. The Rochusberg (mountain) is nearly completely surrounded by the town site.

===Constituent communities===
===Population development===

==History==

===Antiquity===
Even before the Romans came, people lived here, because the location favoured transport, being at the confluence of the Nahe and Rhine Rivers, and the Rhine&#x27;s entry into the gorge. The first settlement seems to have been a Celtic (Gaulish) settlement by the name of &quot;Binge&quot; – meaning &quot;rift&quot;. In the early first century AD, Roman troops were stationed in Bingen on the Rhine Valley Road, and rendered the local name as Bingium in Latin. There the Romans erected a wooden bridge across the Nahe and constructed a bridgehead castrum. A Roman Mithraic monument, which included a mutilated sculpture representing the nativity of Mithra from a rock, was discovered in Bingen; one of its inscriptions is dated 236.

===Medieval period===
The presbyter Aetherius of Bingen founded sometime between 335 and 360 a firmly Christian community. Bearing witness to this time is Aetherius&#x27;s gravestone, which can still be seen in Saint Martin&#x27;s Basilica. After the fall of the Limes, the town became a Frankish royal estate and passed in 983 by the Donation of Verona from Otto II to Archbishop Willigis of Mainz. Under Otto III the &quot;Binger Kammerforst&quot; (forest) came into being. Under Willigis, some way up the river Nahe, the stone &quot;Drususbrücke&quot; (bridge) was built.

The inhabitants of Bingen strove time and again for independence, which led in 1165 through disputes between the Archbishop of Mainz and the Emperor to destruction. In the 13th century, Bingen was a member of the Rhenish League of Towns. The building of Klopp Castle (&quot;Burg Klopp&quot;) in the mid 13th century could well be seen as being tied in with this development. A last attempt was the town&#x27;s unsuccessful participation in the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525. From the Archbishop the Cathedral Chapter of Mainz acquired the town in two halves in 1424 and 1438. Until the late 18th century Bingen remained under its administration. Like many towns in the valley, Bingen suffered several town fires and wars.

===Modern period===
From 1792 to 1813, the town was, as part of the &quot;département&quot; of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg – both names meaning &quot;Thunder Mountain&quot;), French after French Revolutionary troops had occupied the Rhine&#x27;s left bank. In 1816, after the Congress of Vienna, the town passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt while today&#x27;s outlying centre of Bingerbrück went to Prussia&#x27;s Rhine Province, making Bingen a border town until 1871, when the German Empire was founded.

On 7 June 1969, the formerly Prussian municipality of Bingerbrück was amalgamated. On 22 April 1972 came Dromersheim&#x27;s and Sponsheim&#x27;s amalgamation with Bingen. The epithet &quot;am Rhein&quot; has been borne since 1 July 1982.

For the State Garden Show in 2008 in Bingen, the Rhineside areas in the town underwent extensive modernization.

===Jewish history===
Benjamin of Tudela mentioned a Jewish community in Bingen in the mid-12th century. Christian inhabitants attacked the small Jewish quarter on Rosh Hashanah in 1198 or 1199, and the Jews were driven from the city. Jews again lived in Bingen as moneylenders in the middle of the 13th century under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Mainz. In 1343, French Jews settled in Bingen. In 1405, the archbishop declared a moratorium on one-fifth of the debts owed to Jews by Christians, and subsequently the archbishops repeatedly extorted large sums. Noted rabbis who taught in the small community included Seligmann Oppenheim, who convened the Council of Bingen (1455–56) in an unsuccessful attempt to establish his authority over the whole of Rhineland Jewry. After the proposal was opposed by Moses Minz, the matter was referred to Isaac Isserlein, who rejected the project. The Jews were again expelled from Bingen in 1507, and did not return until the second half of the 16th century. The Jewish population was 465 in 1933, and 222 in 1939 due to flight and emigration. The 169 Jews who remained in Bingen in 1942 were sent to concentration camps, and only four ultimately returned. The synagogue was demolished in 1945, and the community was not reestablished after World War II.

==Politics==

===Town council===
The council is made up of 36 members. The mayor since 2012 has been the CDU politician Thomas Feser. Seats are apportioned thus:

===Coat of arms===
The town&#x27;s arms show Saint Martin cutting off a piece of his cloak for a poor man and, in a small inescutcheon in dexter chief, the Wheel of Mainz.

Already 700 buildings are scientifically catalogued.

==Culture==

===Bingen 2008 State Garden Show===
Bingen was from 18 April to 19 October 2008 host for the Rhineland-Palatinate State Garden Show. The event was held along a 2.8 km stretch of the Rhine waterfront on 24 ha of exhibition area. With 1.3 million visitors, the expected number of 600,000 was greatly exceeded.

===Regular events===

==Economy and infrastructure==

The region is characterized economically by winegrowing, especially as in Bingen three winegrowing areas (Rheinhessen, Mittelrhein and Nahe) meet. The town is also the winegrowing &quot;Bereich&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;Bereich Bingen&quot;) namesake in German wine law.

Other industries that once did business in Bingen when there was a harbour have left the town over the years. The service industries here today are found mainly in the industrial park (Autobahn interchange Bingen-Ost / Kempten / Industriegebiet) and in the Scharlachberg commercial park.

Tourism also plays an important role.

===Resident businesses===
* NSM-Löwen (slot machines)
* Oerlikon Balzers Coating Germany GmbH

===Transport===

====Rail====
The main railway station, &quot;Bingen (Rhein) Hauptbahnhof&quot;, lies in the outlying centre of Bingerbrück. It is served by InterCity trains as well as one ICE line.

Bingen (Rhein) Stadt station lies 2 km farther east, right across from the historical harbour crane. This station is important only for local transport. There is also a stop in Bingen-Gaulsheim. The reason that two railway stations arose in Bingen is historical. The main railway station was originally a Prussian border station built by the Rhenish Railway Company on its West Rhine Railway, whilst the station in town belonged to the Hessian Ludwig Railway.

The stops at Drususbrücke on the Bingen Hbf-Bad Kreuznach line and Bingen-Kempten and Büdesheim-Dromersheim on the Bingen/Rhein Stadt–Alzey line are no longer served.

====Road====
Bingen lies next to Autobahnen A 60 and A 61, which are linked to the town by &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 9.

====Water====

Only private transport is still of importance today. The cargo harbour has been abandoned. The former winter harbour is now a marina.

There are landing stages of the tourist lines Köln-Düsseldorfer, Bingen-Rüdesheimer Fahrgastschifffahrt and Rösslerlinie. A passenger ferry and a car ferry link Bingen with Rüdesheim.

Until the late 1970s Bingen was a piloting station.
