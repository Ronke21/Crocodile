<text>This article lists the characters in the four series and three special episodes of the British sitcom Blackadder. &quot;Blackadder&quot; was notable for featuring actors playing many repeating characters across different eras of history, with Rowan Atkinson as the central character Edmund Blackadder, and Tony Robinson as his sidekick Baldrick, together with numerous other actors in one-off parts.

==Main characters==

===Edmund Blackadder===

* Prince Edmund &quot;The Black Adder&quot; (1): The least intelligent (while highest-ranked) of the Blackadder clan depicted in the series. He is very cowardly and often does not think things through. He despises but fears his family, and dislikes Lord Percy. His closest friend (arguably) is Baldrick, his manservant. On becoming Prince, he initially wants to be called &quot;the Black Vegetable&quot;, before Baldrick convinces him it is a bad idea (read, Baldrick suggests &quot;the Black Adder&quot; and he acted as if it was &quot;his&quot; idea). He accidentally kills his great-uncle, King Richard III, and is repeatedly visited by his ghost. He becomes Duke of Edinburgh and Lord of the Privy. It is a moot point as to whether or not he was the blood-son of the new king or the result of his mother maybe having an affair. At one point he becomes the Archbishop of Canterbury, but is eventually fired (to his relief). He has an arranged marriage to the nine-year-old Princess Leia of Hungary, which displeases him. He possibly has some witch blood in him, as his mother had learnt voodoo-esque magic. He is eventually dethroned as Duke of Edinburgh and gathers the other six most evil men in all England to form the Black Seal. They plan to kill the rest of the royal family and claim the throne, but instead betrayed Edmund, too. He is wounded after being tied to a torture chair, which mutilates his ears, hands and private parts. All his family and the Black Seal mistakenly drink poison and die, making Edmund king, but for all of thirty seconds as he also drinks the poison and dies.
* Edmund, Lord Blackadder (2): The great-grandson of Prince Edmund, Lord Blackadder is in the service of Queen Elizabeth I. He is one of the queen&#x27;s favourites, but is all too keenly aware of the limitations of this position (on several occasions she threatens to cut his head off, and quite happily teams up with Melchett to play practical jokes on him). He despises Lord Percy even more than his predecessor did, and thinks of Baldrick as a stupid animal, though he does not physically abuse him as his descendants do. He and Melchett dislike but tolerate one another. Lord Blackadder spends most of his time dodging death, in a variety of forms and from a variety of sources. During his stint as High Executioner, for example, he executed the wrong man at the wrong time, thereby facing a death warrant from the Queen. On another occasion, he was unable to pay back a £1,000 loan that he had taken from the Black Monks, and was threatened with being impaled by the baby-eating Bishop of Bath and Wells. He spent two years sailing the seas with Captain Rum, seeking a route around the Cape of Good Hope, but nearly died when he discovered that the captain has no crew and no ability to navigate a ship. He is eventually murdered (along with everybody else in the court) by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible.
* Mr. E. Blackadder, Esquire (3), The Butler to the Prince Regent. He is devious, cheeky and probably the most intelligent of all the Blackadders. He has problems keeping the Prince Regent (the later George IV) out of trouble. George is easy to trick and scam; Blackadder makes quite a profit out of selling George&#x27;s possessions, such as socks, when he is not looking. He treats Baldrick with a great deal of contempt, and frequently physically abuses him. Always looking for a way to improve his position, Mr. Blackadder finally gets his chance when George is challenged to a duel by the renowned swordsman, the Duke of Wellington. He switches clothes with the Prince Regent, and is defeated by Wellington, but survives thanks to a conveniently placed cigarette box that Wellington had given to him. Wellington takes this a sign that God is preserving the prince for greater things, and then murders &quot;the butler&quot; (George in disguise), feeling insulted by his disrespectful behaviour, leaving Blackadder free to continue posing as the Prince Regent. It should, perhaps, be noted that this is the only incarnation of Blackadder who we do not actually see killed at the conclusion of the series. It can be safely assumed that he went on to become King, since the TV film of the series, &quot;Blackadder Back &amp; Forth&quot; eventually mentions King Edmund III.
* Captain Edmund Blackadder (4), a disillusioned and cynical British Army Captain. He joined the army in the late 19th century and earned his stripes in the battle of Mboto Gorge in 1892, where he claims the army fought &quot;pygmies armed with sharpened kiwi fruit and mangoes&quot;. He therefore finds the prospect of fighting against armed soldiers who could actually kill him both distasteful and stupid. When the First World War started, he was sent to the trenches with Private Baldrick and Lieutenant George, both of whom he considers idiots but seems to have a genuine affection for. His service is further plagued by General Melchett, a maniac with seemingly no common sense or concern for the men under him, and Captain Kevin Darling, a short-tempered, by the books officer, who panders to Melchett in the hope of staying far away from the front line. Blackadder generally misses no opportunity to mock Darling&#x27;s name and take him down a peg in Melchett&#x27;s eyes. Captain Blackadder is a stone-cold realist and knows that if he and his men are sent &quot;over the top&quot;, most or all of them will die, and he therefore spends much of his time coming up with plans to avoid this possibility. In the end he, Baldrick, George and Darling are, in fact, sent over the top. To the sound of a slow, minimal piano version of the title theme, the four are seen in slow-motion, charging into the fog and smoke of no man&#x27;s land, with gunfire and explosions all around, before the scene fades into footage of a sunny poppy field and the sound of birdsong. The fate of the four is left ambiguous.
* Sir Edmund Blackadder (&quot;The Cavalier Years&quot;): A cavalier during the English Civil War who risks his property and life by his fidelity to the defeated King Charles I. When Baldrick fails to hide Charles from Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Roundheads, Sir Edmund struggles to plan an escape as the King&#x27;s execution draws closer. Baldrick takes up the offer of £1000 for executing the King, but Sir Edmund, initially enraged by this betrayal, declares he will do it himself. Just before the execution, Charles mistakes Sir Edmund&#x27;s intentions for a cunning plan to trick Cromwell and allow Charles and his son, the future Charles II, to flee to France. Knowing he cannot admit to his greed, Sir Edmund panicks and puts forward Baldrick&#x27;s suggestion for saving the King: cut off a pumpkin passed off as Charles&#x27; head. Later, with his house surrounded by the Roundheads, Sir Edmund declares he must fight for his future sovereign, but, not being a man of honour, disguises himself as a Roundhead and denounces Baldrick as &quot;royalist scum&quot;.
* Ebenezer Blackadder (&quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;): The proprietor of a &quot;moustache shop&quot;, aided by Baldrick, from which he makes a modest living every year. He is the nicest man in all England, giving away all of his money and property to anyone claiming to be in need. Of course, all his friends and neighbours see him as an easy touch and take full advantage of him, shamefully. For once (since the first Baldrick), this Baldrick seems to be the more intelligent of the two, as he tries to convince Blackadder not to give so freely. One Christmas Eve, after giving away the year&#x27;s profits, the Christmas tree, the modest Christmas gifts, and even his tiny turkey to a slew of greedy visitors, Blackadder is visited by a friendly spirit. The spirit inadvertently shows this Blackadder how his predecessors behaved and that his descendants will suffer if he continues to be so self-sacrificing, and how they will come to rule the galaxy if he changes his ways. Not a fool, Ebenezer decides to embark on a new way of life immediately. When Queen Victoria and Prince Albert come to grant him money and titles due to his kindness, he insults them, not realising they are the real Queen and consort, and in doing so loses out on fortune and wealth in his personal lifetime.
* Lord Edmund Blackadder / King Edmund III (&quot;Back and Forth&quot;): A modern-day trickster and a charmer. On the eve of the year 2000, he invites his friends over for dinner, intending to make money off them through an elaborate practical joke. Using what he claims are plans from one of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s notebooks, he has Baldrick build a time machine; he then bets his friends that he can go back in time and obtain any object they desire. To his surprise, the time machine, intended as a prop, actually works, and he winds up changing history. Blackadder is later revealed, after altering history one last time, to be the absolute monarch King Edmund III, with Baldrick as his puppet Prime Minister and with Maid Marian (from the Robin Hood legend) revealed to become his queen and bride as Queen Marian of Sherwood.

===Baldrick===

Baldrick is the name of several characters throughout the series. Each one serves as Blackadder&#x27;s servant and sidekick and acts as a foil to the lead character. Baldrick is the only character besides Blackadder himself to appear in all installments of the series, and can arguably be seen as Blackadder&#x27;s best friend despite Blackadder&#x27;s apparent contempt for him.

===Melchett===
Melchett (Stephen Fry) is a family line. There were two main Melchetts: Lord Melchett and General Melchett.

*&quot;Blackadder II&quot; – The first Melchett appeared in series two of &quot;Blackadder&quot;. He is Lord Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth I. Affectionately known to the Queen as &quot;Melchy&quot;, the earnest Lord Melchett has set himself up as her closest personal advisor and is always close to her. He guards his position jealously (sometimes seen in competition with Blackadder, a dynamic that would later be seen between Captains Blackadder and Darling, in season 4, set in WWI) and is always doing his best to please the Queen. Melchett attends the Annual Communion Wine-Tasting and is also able to officiate at marriage ceremonies, two facts which suggest that he has a career in the church alongside his duties to the Queen. Like the rest of the court, Melchett was killed at the end of the Blackadder II series finale episode, &quot;Chains&quot; by the psychopathic German Prince Ludwig the Indestructible, a master of disguise, Ludwig being played by Fry&#x27;s comedy partner, Hugh Laurie.
*&quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; – The Melchett dynasty has changed quite a bit in &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;; rather than being the snivelling, slimy, reserved, intelligent, obsequious sycophant that the Elizabethan era Lord Melchett was, General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett, VC KCB DSO is a loud, childish, unintelligent, incompetent, pompous warmonger who appears in the fourth series. The General Melchett character appearing in &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; reflects the popular caricature of First World War generals in that his preferred battle tactics and general attitudes towards warfare are stuck firmly in a bygone era. Melchett fails to understand or comprehend the basic concepts of modern trench warfare and is totally unable to come up with a new strategy that would suit it. Instead he continuously sends his men to a senseless death with seemingly no tactics at all. In &quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, Melchett also remarks that he is a General with a &quot;dicky heart&quot; and a &quot;wooden bladder&quot;. In the specials, &quot;Blackadder: the Whole Rotten Saga&quot; and &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Most Cunning Moments&quot;, Fry also revealed that the Melchett of &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; was much more aggressive, powerful and more insane than the Melchett of Blackadder II and that Melchett&#x27;s &quot;Baaaah!&quot; is caused by him having haemorrhoids.

Melchett shared the trademark bellow &quot;Baaah!&quot; with Fry&#x27;s earlier portrayal of Wellington, which would be delivered at random intervals for no apparent reason. In a BBC Four interview broadcast on 17 August 2007, Fry goes into some depth on the &quot;odd history&quot; of Melchett&#x27;s &quot;Baaah!&quot;, explaining that it began as early as his work in student productions of Shakespeare at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he would produce strange noises in order to amuse the audience. He also notes that Melchett&#x27;s &quot;Baaah!&quot; can be found (although in a more subtle form) in his other acting work such as &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot;.

In April 2020, Fry reprised his role as a descendant of Lord Melchett for &quot;The Big Night In&quot;, a telethon held during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a skit which he held a video call with Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, who made a surprise appearance.

===Lord Percy Percy===
Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny) is the name given to a pair of related characters. The Lord Percy of &quot;Blackadder II&quot; is the descendant of that seen in &quot;The Black Adder&quot;. The character derives his name from the real Percy family. Unlike the first two Blackadders and Baldricks, the two Lord Percys are almost identical; both are portrayed as dim-witted, gullible and foppish. In the first series, Percy is Duke of Northumberland, while in the second he is heir to the title. The title of Duke of Northumberland was not in fact held by a real person surnamed Percy until 1766, when Hugh Percy, born Hugh Smithson, was awarded the title, although the title of the Earl of Northumberland was granted to a Percy in 1377.

*&quot;The Black Adder&quot; – Percy is introduced in the first series as Percy, the Duke of Northumberland. In the first series, Percy accompanies both Prince Edmund and Baldrick on all their journeys. At one point, Percy becomes the bishop of Ramsgate when Edmund becomes the Archbishop of Canterbury; he also believes he has a finger bone belonging to Jesus Christ. However, Baldrick informs him that it is a fake by displaying his own collection of ten other &quot;Jesus fingers&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Black Seal&quot;, Percy accidentally puts poison in the castle&#x27;s entire wine supply while trying to rescue Prince Edmund from a group of maniacs. While rescuing Edmund, Percy inevitably kills him and the whole royal court when they drink the tainted wine. Percy and Baldrick run in and futilely shout, &quot;Don&#x27;t drink the wine!&quot; immediately after.
*&quot;Blackadder II&quot; – In this series, Lord Percy Percy is once again portrayed as a stupid &quot;upper-class twit&quot;. Percy has a much larger role in series two, however; this is illustrated by his almost total involvement in all of Blackadder&#x27;s pursuits (whether or not Blackadder actually welcomes his input). Percy is (among other things) temporarily the best man at Blackadder&#x27;s wedding, assistant Lord High Executioner and a shipmate on Blackadder&#x27;s ill-fated voyage to France (despite a pronounced aquaphobia stemming from a childhood incident where he was &quot;savaged by a turbot&quot;). At one point, while trying to master alchemy in an afternoon, Percy creates a green substance that Edmund sarcastically calls &quot;Green&quot; and attempts to turn it into something valuable. He is shown to have a terrible record with women; whilst the occasional girlfriend is mentioned, he is more often seen using rather unconvincing chat-up lines on various females, and, at one point, Baldrick, who was wearing a wig and a dress while acting as a bridesmaid. Percy promptly falls in love with him, not recognising Baldrick and even kissing him. Like the rest of the court, Percy dies at the end of the Blackadder II series finale episode, &quot;Chains&quot; at the hands of the psychopathic German Prince Ludwig the Indestructible (Hugh Laurie).
*&quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; - The episode Nob and Nobility features McInnerny portraying a French aristocrat by the name Le Comte de Frou Frou, who in the last act is revealed to be a false persona of the masked vigilante going by the name of Scarlet Pimpernel. McInnerny&#x27;s portrayal of the Pimpernel follows largely that of Percy, with his true identity being Sir Percy Blakeney in the Baroness Orczy novels where the character originates from.

===Darling===

Introduced in its fourth iteration, &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, Captain Kevin Darling (Tim McInnerny) is main character Captain Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson)&#x27;s intellectual peer and bitter rival (just like Melchett was in season 2); while Blackadder reluctantly serves in World War I trenches, Darling is safely stationed some distance from the front line. Darling is the sycophantic adjutant to Stephen Fry&#x27;s General Melchett. The character was originally conceived as &quot;Captain Cartwright&quot;; writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis were simply unable to think of a more amusing name for him. Eventually however, Stephen Fry suggested &quot;Darling&quot; would be a more comedic alternative; the series makes use of a recurring joke where his name is used or referred to for comedic effect.

====Awards and decorations====
In the series, Captain Darling is seen wearing the following ribbons:
Although Darling only features as a main character for one series of the original &quot;Blackadder&quot; run, several of his ancestors and descendants are also portrayed by McInnerny, in keeping with the series&#x27; ongoing motif of identical descendants. The &quot;Blackadder&quot; feature-length special &quot;&quot; (1999) introduced descendant character Archdeacon Darling, on better terms with the contemporary Blackadder. The time travel narrative of the special also allowed writers to introduce more historical Darlings to the series&#x27; chronology: the Duke of Darling, aide to the Duke of Wellington (Fry), and the Duc de Darling, assistant to Napoleon I (Simon Russell Beale). The final Darling, however, is also a Blackadder and was portrayed by Atkinson in BBC promotional materials in 2002; the name Sir Osmond Darling-Blackadder suggests an unknown familial union between Blackadders and Darlings at some point in their histories.

===George===

George (Hugh Laurie) appears in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; as the Prince Regent; Lt. The Hon. George Colthurst St Barleigh, an overexcited and keen young lieutenant in &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;; and Major George Bufton-Tufton, Viscount Bufton-Tufton and Roman consul Georgius in &quot;&quot;.

===Bob===
Bob is a pseudonym used by two characters, both female, both pretending to be male and both played by Gabrielle Glaister.

*&quot;Blackadder II&quot; – Kate, who goes by the pseudonym &quot;Bob&quot;, is one of the first characters to appear in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;. She is a somewhat naive young woman who insists on believing her mother is dead, despite her father&#x27;s insistence that she ran off with his brother. Her aging father informs her that due to his imminent dotage he must look to his daughter to sustain him, and suggests that the best way is for her to become a prostitute, which she refuses. After arriving in London, she disguises herself as a man and is hired as a manservant by Lord Blackadder, who casually kicks Baldrick out on to the streets. However, when Blackadder points out that &quot;Kate&quot; is a girl&#x27;s name, she quickly claims it is short for &quot;Bob&quot;. Blackadder becomes increasingly concerned about the attraction he feels for the boy. Eventually, after being prescribed a course of leeches by a doctor and an attempt to throw Bob out, he learns the truth (after Kate opens her doublet in front of him), and within several minutes they have had sex and become engaged. However, at the wedding, Kate is seduced by Blackadder&#x27;s best man, Lord Flashheart, and decides to run off with him, leaving Blackadder jilted at the altar.
*&quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; – The episode &quot;Major Star&quot; introduces General Melchett&#x27;s driver, Bob Parkhurst. Captain Blackadder recognises Bob&#x27;s gender immediately. She begs Blackadder not to give her away, explaining that all her brothers have signed up, and she wants &quot;to see how a war is fought, so badly&quot;. While Blackadder is not fooled, Lieutenant George is, failing to spot the truth even when she emerges from the shower wearing only a towel. So is Melchett, who, while attracted to the singer Gorgeous Georgina (utterly failing to recognise Lieutenant George in drag), is outraged when she is replaced by Bob whom he believes to be in drag herself. In &quot;Private Plane&quot;, she appears to have revealed the truth to Melchett, as she is shown dressed in a female uniform and goes by the name &quot;Bobbie&quot;, but still serves as Melchett&#x27;s driver. As the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps was founded in 1917, Bob may have learned of its formation after the events of &quot;Major Star&quot;, confessed her true sex and asked for a transfer to the WAAC. As in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, she is seduced by Squadron Commander the Lord Flashheart, and runs off with him, much to Blackadder&#x27;s annoyance.
*&quot;Upstart Crow&quot; – Glaister again played Bob, now judge Robert Roberts, in the sixth episode of Ben Elton&#x27;s 2016 sitcom about William Shakespeare.

===Lord Flashheart===
Lord Flashheart (Rik Mayall) is the name of two characters. The first Lord Flashheart appeared in a scene of the first episode of the second series of &quot;Blackadder&quot;. His descendant, Squadron Commander the Lord Flashheart, appeared as a major character in the fourth series in an episode called &quot;Private Plane&quot;. In the credits of this episode the name Flashheart is spelled Flasheart.

Lord Flashheart is boisterous and an arrogant womaniser, attractive to all the women he meets. He is extremely popular among his peers and becomes the centre of attention whenever he enters a room, usually by bursting through a door in a spectacular fashion. The two Flashhearts are stereotypes of a certain kind of hero (the Elizabethan swashbuckler and the World War I flying ace), slanted to emphasise the negative qualities associated with such characters such as narcissism, sexism and promiscuity. His catchphrases are &quot;Woof!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s do-oo-ooooo it!&quot;, while suggestively thrusting his pelvis. He commonly uses sexual innuendo in ordinary conversation, for example, &quot;Am I pleased to see you, or did I just put a canoe in my pocket?&quot; Rik Mayall later recalled, &quot;I was surprised when they asked me. Very honouring that they asked me. &#x27;Alright,&#x27; I said, &#x27;I&#x27;ll do it, as long as I get more laughs than Rowan.

The writing for Lord Flashheart seems to have been at least in part inspired by George MacDonald Fraser’s, adaptation of Harry Flashman.

The character of Robin Hood in &quot;&quot;, also played by Mayall, is essentially another version of Flashheart, with the same personality and mannerisms.

In Ben Elton&#x27;s 2016 sitcom &quot;Upstart Crow&quot;, Tim Downie&#x27;s character Christopher Marlowe resembles Flashheart.

===Queenie===
&quot;Queenie&quot; (Miranda Richardson) is a caricature of the historical figure Queen Elizabeth I of England featured in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;. Though she is only twice referred to as &quot;Queenie&quot; in the series, this name is commonly used by the general public. In contrast to the usual regal and austere depiction of Elizabeth I, Miranda Richardson&#x27;s portrayal is childish, spoiled and silly, possessing a fiery temper. Amanda Barrie&#x27;s portrayal of Cleopatra in the 1964 film &quot;Carry On Cleo&quot; as a childish seductress has been suggested as an inspiration for Richardson&#x27;s interpretation of Elizabeth I. It has been remarked that Queenie closely resembles the character Violet Elizabeth Bott featured in the &quot;Just William&quot; books of Richmal Crompton.

In &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, Richardson appears as Queenie and the future Queen Asphyxia. In &quot;Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth&quot;, she appears as present day Lady Elizabeth and Queenie.

Queenie&#x27;s immature behaviour is expressed in her desire to &quot;get squiffy and seduce nobles&quot; (and extort extravagant presents from them on pain of death). A naughty schoolgirl at heart, Queenie loves to party, play games and get drunk. If anyone fails to laugh at her jokes, they risk execution, but, to her followers&#x27; bemusement and frustration, she sometimes tires of their toadying and welcomes a more cynical approach – which is why she prefers Edmund Blackadder to Lord Melchett. Like Blackadder and the rest of her court, Queenie is later murdered at the hands of the evil Prince Ludwig the Indestructible, (Hugh Laurie), a German master of disguise who presumably after stealing her identity goes on to kill the remaining members of the court including Blackadder and Melchett before going on to rule England as Queen off-screen during the Blackadder II series finale episode, &quot;Chains&quot;.

Richardson appears in later series as characters not explicitly stated as being descendants of Elizabeth I, who had no known offspring (but may share common ancestors with her). In the fifth episode of &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, she plays Amy Hardwood, the seemingly-delicate wealthy industrialist&#x27;s daughter, whom the Prince Regent courts to get out of serious debt with her dowry, later revealed as a highwayman, the &quot;Shadow&quot;; and in the episode &quot;General Hospital&quot; of the fourth series, she plays Nurse Mary Fletcher-Brown who enjoys a fling with Blackadder, before being accused of being a German spy.

==Non-recurring major characters==

===Prince Ludwig the Indestructible===
Prince Ludwig the Indestructible (Hugh Laurie) appears in &quot;Chains&quot;, the final episode of &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, as the main antagonist and the final villain of the entire &quot;Blackadder II&quot; series. He is a German master of disguise who kidnaps Lord Blackadder and Lord Melchett in 1566 and imprisons them in his dungeon under the watch of two German guards who carried out the abduction and a Spanish inquisitorial co-conspirator. He had previously befriended Blackadder, Melchett and Queenie while disguised as other individuals, including Big Sally (a waitress at a pub in Dover), Fluffy (a sheep) and an unnamed stable boy. In his childhood his mother forced him to wear shorts at school. He also had dirty hair and spots. He was therefore bullied by his classmates, who gave him the nickname, &quot;Shorty Greasy Spot-Spot&quot;. He despises the name to such an extent that he flies into a rage whenever it is mentioned in his presence. As a result, he became a power-hungry megalomaniac, determined to fulfil his goal of becoming King of England by any means necessary. Once his men capture Blackadder and Melchett, he keeps them imprisoned in a dungeon, and sends a message to Queenie, giving her a week to decide whom she will save by paying the ransom. However, when the message arrives, Ludwig reveals that Queenie has in fact decided to keep the money and hold a big party instead, much to Blackadder&#x27;s shock and Ludwig&#x27;s disappointment. Blackadder and Melchett soon play ball, agreeing to give Ludwig information on how to infiltrate Richmond Palace and kill Queenie. Ludwig therefore changes their original death sentences to life imprisonment. After he departs, Blackadder and Melchett soon work together to outwit his guards, travelling back to England just in time for the costume party, where Blackadder exposes Ludwig who was posing as a cow; Blackadder realised that Ludwig&#x27;s cow outfit was too good, while Nursie who always went as a cow had an udder fixation. When Ludwig attempts to flee while swearing he&#x27;ll exact his revenge, Blackadder informs him that he will die and be buried, and throws a dagger at Ludwig that presumably either kills or wounds him off-screen, as the rest of the group celebrate the fact that Ludwig has been defeated. However, after the end credits have aired, it is revealed that Ludwig has resurfaced and, now disguised as Queenie after murdering her, has gone on to kill the entire main cast by using a dagger to cut their throats although it is implied that he broke Blackadder&#x27;s neck or strangled or suffocated Melchett. Ludwig is regarded as the most serious villain in the Blackadder franchise, having successfully murdered the main cast as well as being the only villain in the series not to have been killed off or even brought to justice for the crimes he committed. From a real-world point of view, this is part of Hugh Laurie&#x27;s continuous set of appearances in &quot;Blackadder&quot;, but the last of those in which he is only credited as a guest actor, Laurie having made his debut appearance in the previous Blackadder II episode, &quot;Beer&quot; as Simon Partridge or &quot;Farters Parters&quot; and &quot;Mr. Ostrich&quot;, a drunk. He remains one of two actors in the Blackadder series to have played two completely different characters in the same series, &quot;Blackadder II&quot; (the other being Rowan Atkinson himself, who played Mr. E. Blackadder and his Scottish cousin MacAdder in the &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; series finale episode, &quot;Duel and Duality&quot;). Laurie was the first to do so, with Atkinson second. Laurie would later join the main cast for &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; and &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;; possibly, they all share a common ancestor. (Lt. George had a German uncle, so this is not out of the question.)

===King Richard IV of England===
King Richard IV (Brian Blessed) is the father of Prince Harry and Prince Edmund Plantagenet (&quot;The Black Adder&quot;) and features in the first series. The character is very loosely based on the historical figure Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York, one of the Princes in the Tower who disappeared in 1483 (as the real-life Richard would have been approximately twelve if still alive in 1485). In the alternate chronology of &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, King Richard III of England (played by Peter Cook) is introduced as being a &quot;kind and thoughtful man&quot; who cherishes his nephews (the two princes) placed into his care, in contrast to the common historical portrait of Richard III as an usurper who likely murdered the princes. Richard, Duke of York grew into &quot;a big strong boy&quot; (the fate of his elder brother, Edward V of England, is left unmentioned), and becomes his uncle&#x27;s favourite, reflected by his being seated at the side of the king at the banquet on the eve of the Battle of Bosworth Field, which is a victory for the House of York during the Wars of the Roses. Richard is crowned King Richard IV of England after Richard III is accidentally killed by Edmund, and though he by far favours Harry over Edmund, he gradually comes to appreciate Edmund as a loyal son, and is genuinely saddened by Edmund&#x27;s imminent death in the final episode (unaware that Edmund had tried and failed to overthrow him). As he drinks a toast to his dying son&#x27;s honour, he and the entire royal court are killed after Lord Percy poisoned the entire vat of wine in an exaggerated attempt to kill the Black Seal, a group of assassins led by Edmund&#x27;s archenemy.

===Gertrude of Flanders===
Gertrude of Flanders (Elspet Gray) is the wife of King Richard of England, Scotland and Ireland and mother of Princes Harry and Edmund. In attitude, Gertrude is mostly distant and absent-minded. She had an affair with a Scottish laird, which may have resulted in Edmund&#x27;s birth. She often gives Edmund unwanted advice and embarrasses him. Her character&#x27;s name is never spoken in dialogue in &quot;Blackadder&quot;, but appears in the credits. She is also a skilled practitioner of witchcraft, which she uses to help Edmund escape execution. But she, along with her royal family, is killed in the series&#x27; finale, after drinking wine poisoned by Lord Percy.

===Nursie===
Nursie (Patsy Byrne), real name &quot;Bernard&quot;, appears in all six episodes of &quot;Blackadder II&quot; and two of the &quot;Blackadder&quot; specials; &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Once Queenie&#x27;s childhood nurse, by the time of her appearances in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, Nursie is either senile or otherwise irreversibly stupid, but remains at court at the side of the Queen for unknown reasons (possibly being kept-on as a lady&#x27;s companion, though her continued presence at &quot;Queenie&#x27;s&quot; side reinforces her portrayal as &#x27;childish&#x27;), as the Queen repeatedly treats Nursie with contempt. Nursie frequently embarrasses both the Queen and herself by openly recounting tales of the Queen&#x27;s childhood, prompting Queenie&#x27;s standard reply of &quot;Shut up, Nursie.&quot; She is also known for her complete non sequiturs in conversation. Lord Blackadder describes her as &quot;a sad, insane old woman with an udder fixation.&quot; In the series&#x27; finale episode, &quot;Chains&quot;, she is killed by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible (Hugh Laurie) along with the entire main cast. In &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, a vision of the future depicts her as the silliest of Queen Asphyxia XIX&#x27;s triple husbandoid.

Byrne later said that she was sometimes asked – in reference to a scene in the final episode of &quot;Blackadder II&quot; – whether she kept the cow costume in her wardrobe. She did not.

The real life basis for Nursie was Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s real governesses, Kat Ashley, Margaret Bryan and Blanche Parry.

===Harry, Prince of Wales===
Prince Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Plantagenet, Earl of March (1460–1498) (Robert East) was a main supporting character in &quot;The Black Adder&quot; (series 1). His Royal titles were the Prince of Wales, Earl of March, Captain of the Guard, Grand Warden of the Northern and Eastern Marches, Chief Lunatic of the Duchy of Gloucester, Viceroy of Wales, Sheriff of Nottingham, Marquess of the Midlands, Lord Po-Maker-In-Ordinary, and Harbinger of the Doomed Rat. A member of the House of York, Harry is the first son of King Richard IV of England (Brian Blessed) and Queen consort Gertrude of Flanders (Elspet Gray) and great-nephew of Richard III (Peter Cook). He has a younger brother (possibly his half-brother), Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh (Rowan Atkinson).

The first portrayal of Prince Harry in the &quot;Blackadder&quot; story world was in the pilot episode which was shot in 1982 but not broadcast until 2023. In this episode, which is set sometime during the Elizabethan Era, Harry&#x27;s character is one of two sons of the King and Queen of England. Although monarchs are not explicitly named, Harry may be intended as a fictional offspring of Queen Elizabeth I. This version of the character was played by the actor Robert Bathurst. Prince Harry made his first televised appearance (played by Robert East) in episode 1 of &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, entitled &quot;The Foretelling&quot;, in which the events of the first series are set up by rewriting a period of English history and telling the story of a fictional ruling monarch who succeeds Richard III after the Battle of Bosworth Field.

===Mrs Miggins===
Mrs Miggins (Helen Atkinson-Wood) plays a supporting role in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;. In &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, Mrs Miggins is referred to as a pie shop owner, but never appears. In the third series, Mrs Miggins plays a major role and appears in all episodes. She now owns a coffee shop that Blackadder visits regularly. In the final episode, she runs off with Blackadder&#x27;s Scottish cousin, MacAdder. Mrs Miggins is also briefly referenced in the final episode of &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;, when George suggests they could pass the time by singing along to &quot;music hall hits&quot;, one of them being &quot;Whoops Mrs Miggins, you&#x27;re sitting on my artichokes!&quot;

==Minor characters==
*Lord Angus (Valentine Dyall) – (&quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot;)
*Anon (Mark Arden) – a guard at the Royal Palace, along with Soft. (&quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot;, &quot;The Black Seal&quot;)
*Tally Applebottom (Jane Freeman) – a peasant with an apparent inability to stop laughing madly, she very nearly committed bigamy with Prince Edmund. (&quot;The Queen of Spain&#x27;s Beard&quot;)
*Thomas Applebottom (Howard Lew Lewis) – Tally Applebottom&#x27;s husband. He was not happy that Prince Edmund was attempting to marry his wife. He also appears in the prologue of &quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot; in which he dies of the Black Death. (&quot;The Queen of Spain&#x27;s Beard&quot;, &quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot;)
*Tom the Balladeer (Tony Aitken) – a minstrel who sings songs about the continued failures of Lord Edmund Blackadder (Elizabethan). Other than a brief scene in &quot;Money&quot;, the minstrel appeared only in the closing credits of each episode of &quot;Blackadder II&quot;, in the first episodes he annoys Blackadder, and gets hunted in the later episodes. In one episode, the minstrel appeared before Blackadder (coincidentally, the same one in which he had a brief appearance). In the last episode, Blackadder caught the minstrel and possibly drowned him. (&quot;Blackadder II&quot;)
*Beadle and the Enormous Orphans – Beadle, an orphan master (Denis Lill) and his enormous orphans (David Barber, Erkan Mustafa and David Nunn) appear in the Christmas special &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. Despite claiming to be poor, all three of the orphans are actually morbidly obese. They are, in fact, so fat that they must push and shove each other in order to all fit into a room, with Blackadder remarking that he is always afraid of &quot;bursting one of them and getting showered in two dozen semi-digested pies.&quot;
*Friar Bellows (Paul Brooke) – a member of The Black Seal and the clergy, Friar Bellows&#x27; godliness was somewhat less than complete given his fondness for fornication and murder. (&quot;The Black Seal&quot;)
*Ivor &quot;Jest Ye Not Madam&quot; Biggun (Geoffrey McGivern) – a politician who participated in the Dunny-on-the-Wold by-election in &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot;, standing for the &quot;Standing at the Back Dressed Stupidly and Looking Stupid Party&quot; (an early frivolous party and a parody of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party). Biggun loses the election to Baldrick, but, unlike the others, takes his defeat jovially, saying that: &quot;if you can&#x27;t laugh, what can you do?&quot;. His party&#x27;s policies included: &quot;the compulsory serving of asparagus at breakfast, free corsets for the under-fives, and the abolition of slavery&quot;, the last of which was apparently added &quot;for a joke&quot;.
* The baby-eating Bishop of Bath and Wells (Ronald Lacey) is an enforcer for a loan-sharking operation, The Bank of the Black Monks, in the second-series episode &quot;Money&quot;. Blackadder owes him and the bank £1,000, and when Blackadder cannot afford to pay, the bishop threatens to shove a hot poker into his rectum. Blackadder drugs the bishop and blackmails him by having the bishop sketched in bed with Lord Percy.
*Brigadier General Horace Bolsom (Geoffrey Palmer) – a candidate for the Dunny-on-the-Wold by-election in &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot;, standing for the &quot;Keep Royalty White, Rat Catching and Safe Sewage Residents Party&quot;. Possibly a parody of Bill Boaks, a regular by-election candidate on a Public Safety, Democratic Monarchist and White Resident ticket.
*Philip of Burgundy aka &quot;The Hawk/Thrush&quot; (Patrick Allen) – The deadly childhood rival of Prince Edmund, he was known to his enemies as &quot;The Hawk&quot; (or, when a child, &quot;The Thrush&quot;). Philip managed to wrest control of The Black Seal away from Edmund, leading to Edmund&#x27;s hideously violent but amusing death on a bizarre torture device, the &quot;amusing&quot; part coming from the feathers used to tickle Edmund under &quot;what&#x27;s left of [his] arms&quot;. Philip was poisoned by Baldrick and Percy along with the members of The Black Seal. (&quot;The Black Seal&quot;)
*Sir Talbot Buxomly MP (Denis Lill) – Member of Parliament for the village of Dunny-on-the-Wold in Suffolk, who was recruited by Mr. E. Blackadder and the Prince Regent in the &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; episode &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot; to prevent the Prince Regent from being removed from the Civil List in the House of Commons, but soon died as he sat on a chair while meeting the Prince, and left his seat open for a by-election in Dunny-on-the-Wold.
*Cain &amp; Abel (Bert Parnaby &amp; Roy Evans) – A pair of peasants with a great admiration for a faceful of manure. (&quot;The Archbishop&quot;, &quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot;, &quot;The Black Seal&quot;)
*Lord Chiswick (Stephen Tate) – a courtier to King Richard IV of England. His most significant function appeared to be keeping the King supplied with fresh horses, although he did occasionally curb his master&#x27;s fiery temper.
*Cordelia (Gretchen Franklin) – one of a triad of three haggard witches. Named Goneril, Regan and Cordelia after King Lear&#x27;s daughters, they foretell that Edmund shall become king, despite him referring to them as &quot;hideous crones&quot;, &quot;loathsome drabs&quot; and &quot;snaggle-toothed vultures&quot;. It is only after he leaves that they realise they have mixed him up with Henry Tudor. They appear to make this mistake frequently. The witches appeared in the episode, &quot;The Foretelling&quot;.
*Sir Justin de Boinod (Bill Wallis) – an English knight of Norman descent freshly returned from the Crusades, he and his drunken colleague Sir George de Boeuf attempted to murder Edmund Plantagenet, Archbishop of Canterbury after misunderstanding the King. However, they failed to fully replicate the murder of Thomas Becket and Edmund was merely excommunicated. (&quot;The Archbishop&quot;)
*Sir George de Boeuf (David Delve) – one of the two knights involved in the failed assassination of Prince Edmund during his tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury. (&quot;The Archbishop&quot;)
*Maria Escalosa, Infanta of Spain (Miriam Margolyes) – Infanta of Spain, Maria Escalosa was briefly engaged to Prince Edmund following an arranged marriage by the King for his own political gains. Expecting a ravishing Royal princess, Edmund was rather disappointed to discover she did not quite accord with his mental picture, being short and fat.
*Nurse Mary Fletcher-Brown (Miranda Richardson) – appears in the &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; episode &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Like Amy Hardwood in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, she has a &quot;&quot;fluffy bunny act&quot;, (her bedside manner), but is really a highly intelligent cynic. Though Prince George was originally disgusted by Amy&#x27;s stupid act, his descendant Lieutenant George thinks Nurse Mary is &quot;an absolute peach,&quot; and appears to be to the nursery under her care. She had a brief fling with Captain Blackadder, but this time it was he who was leading her on, suspecting her of being a German spy and eventually exposing her (calling her &quot;Nurse Fleischer-Baum&quot;&quot;) with three few-supposed facts. She was sent to be executed by firing squad, but when Blackadder learns that the real source of information being leaked to the Germans was an unwitting Lieutenant George (because of inter-familial relationships between British and German aristocrats), he rushes after her, and it is unclear as to whether or not she survives.
*Le Comte de Frou Frou (Tim McInnerny) – an apparently foppish, disgruntled, homesick French aristocrat in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;. The character was forced to flee his home country for England, in order to escape the French Revolution. He was later revealed to be a disguise adopted by Prince George&#x27;s friend Lord Topper, alias one half of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
*Mad Gerald (Rik Mayall) – a one-time cellmate of Prince Edmund whilst the latter was waiting to be eaten alive by snails, he had two friends: Mr Rat and Mr Key, which Gerald made from his own teeth (&quot;The Black Seal&quot;). Actor Rik Mayall later returned as Lord Flashheart in &quot;Blackadder II&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Bells&quot;, as Squadron Commander The Lord Flashheart in Blackadder Goes Forth&#x27;s &quot;Private Plane&quot; and as Robin Hood in &quot;&quot;.
*Goneril (Kathleen St John) – one of a triad of three haggard witches, modelled on the witches from Macbeth. Named Goneril, Regan and Cordelia after King Lear&#x27;s daughters, they foretell that Edmund shall become king, despite him referring to them as &quot;hideous crones&quot;, &quot;loathsome drabs&quot; and &quot;snaggle-toothed vultures&quot;. It is only after he leaves that they realise they have mixed him up with Henry Tudor (i.e. the genuine Macbeth). They appear to make this mistake frequently. The witches appeared in the episode, &quot;The Foretelling&quot;.
*Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig (Geoffrey Palmer) – the hard-nosed leader of the British Army during the First World War whose best advice for Blackadder to escape the final push was to stick two pencils up his nose and his underpants on his head so that he would be classed as insane and sent home, a plan which Blackadder had already tried - &quot;The phrase rhymes with clucking bell.&quot;.
*Amy Hardwood (Miranda Richardson) – chosen by Mr. E. Blackadder Esq. to be the bride of his master, the Prince Regent, due to his belief that her father, a bad-tempered northern industrialist, was extremely rich. However, upon the discovery that Mr. Hardwood wished his daughter to marry the prince for &quot;his&quot; money, Blackadder called it off, realising the Hardwoods were impoverished. She is later revealed as a highwayman, the Shadow.
*Keanrick and Mossop (Hugh Paddick and Kenneth Connor) – two actors who run a local theatre that Prince George frequents. Despite their flamboyant, over the top and unconvincing style of acting, George loves their performances, although he can never understand that they are not real. His butler, Mr. E. Blackadder Esq., is not as interested in their performances.
*Kate&#x27;s Father (Edward Jewesbury) – the father of &quot;Bob&quot;, or rather Kate. As he had grown too old to support himself and his daughter, he was in favour of the idea of Kate becoming a prostitute. Instead, she decided to go to London, disguise herself as a boy, and seek her fortune. (&quot;Bells&quot;)
*Jack Large (Big Mick) – also known as Unspeakably Violent Jack, the Bull-Buggering, Priest-Killer of No Fixed Abode, his fearsome reputation was somewhat undermined by his being somewhat less than five-foot tall. Jack was a member of The Black Seal and died after being poisoned by Baldrick and Percy. (&quot;The Black Seal&quot;)
*Princess Leia of Hungary (Natasha King) – In 1492, at the age of eight, she married the show&#x27;s central character, Prince Edmund, although she was originally betrothed to his brother, Prince Harry. A last-minute complication had changed matters, and Edmund was married to Leia instead of his original fiancée, Maria Escalosa, the Spanish Infanta (played by Miriam Margolyes). Three years later, Leia seemed uncomprehending or unconcerned at the prospect of her husband being burned as a witch.
*Reverend Lloyd (John Rapley) – The priest who nearly bigamously married Prince Edmund to Tally Applebottom via rather violent persuasion by Baldrick. Tally Applebottom&#x27;s husband Thomas made a well-timed interruption of the ceremony, accompanied by a large scythe. (&quot;The Queen of Spain&#x27;s Beard&quot;)
*MacAdder (Rowan Atkinson) – The nearly identical — though red-haired — Scottish cousin of Mr. E. Blackadder Esq. He is known as being the &quot;most dangerous man ever to wear a skirt in Europe&quot;. He believes he is rightful king of England and plans to incite rebellion, meaning his cousin is very frustrated with him. He is apparently a skilled swordsman, but also a kipper salesman and married to a woman named Morag back in Scotland though he initiates in an affair with Mrs. Miggins. He had two children; a boy named Jamie, and girl named Angus (instead of Agnes). Mr. Edmund Blackadder Esq. wants him to take his place in the duel with the Iron Duke of Wellington to which MacAdder replies: &quot;Why don&#x27;t I take the place of the Duke of Wellington and kill the prince?&quot; Edmund Blackadder tells MacAdder that if he does this he will incur the wrath of the bailiffs. MacAdder thereby declines and leaves for Scotland with Miggins, foiling Blackadder&#x27;s plan.
*Dougal MacAngus, 4th Duke of Argyll (Alex Norton) – The character appears in the episode &quot;Born to Be King&quot;. He is Supreme Commander of the King&#x27;s Army and the Fourth Duke of Argyll. Upon his return from a crusade against the Turks, he is rewarded for his bravery with Prince Edmund&#x27;s Scottish lands. Enraged, Edmund schemes to have him stabbed on stage during the entertainment.
*Messenger (David Nunn) – The character is presented as being clumsy and unintelligent and speaks with a strong estuary English accent. Each time the Messenger appears he enters a room and announces &quot;My Lord, news!&quot;. In &quot;The Queen of Spain&#x27;s Beard&quot;, he is one of three messengers bearing news about various European nobility, announcing &quot;Lord Wessex is dead!&quot;. King Richard&#x27;s retort, &quot;I like not this news! Bring me some other news!&quot; is based on a line from Shakespeare&#x27;s Richard III Act 4 Scene 4 in which Richard says, &quot;There, take thou that till thou bring better news,&quot; after hearing bad news from a messenger. The Blackadder Messenger is also prone to a kind of compulsive mimicry, mirroring Prince Edmund&#x27;s movements.
*Millicent (Nicola Bryant) is Blackadder&#x27;s rich, spoilt-rotten goddaughter in the Christmas special &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. She wears a ridiculously large bonnet with a feather and has a piercing cackle of a laugh that forces Blackadder to wear a pair of earmuffs.
*Master William Pitt the Even Younger was the fictional younger brother of William Pitt the Younger who took part in the Dunny-on-the-Wold by-election in &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot;, as a representative of the Whigs. Pitt the Even Younger was put up as a candidate against Baldrick by his older brother, Pitt the Younger, but the announcement was welcomed with only sarcasm, and Mr. E. Blackadder Esq. began to ask the name of the candidate, including names such as: Pitt the Toddler, Pitt the Embryo, and Pitt the Glint in the Milkman&#x27;s Eye, poking fun at Pitt the Younger&#x27;s adolescence.
*Queen Victoria (Miriam Margolyes) and Prince Albert (Jim Broadbent) are two main characters in the Christmas special &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. Victoria, while portrayed as being quite small and fat, with Blackadder remarking that she is &quot;the winner of &quot;the round Britain&#x27;s shortest, fattest, dumpiest woman&quot; competition,&quot; is not portrayed in a similar way to Queenie, being portrayed instead as kind-hearted and pleasant, with her favourite Christmas habit being going out posing as common folk with Albert to determine and reward the virtuous. Albert, meanwhile, is portrayed as somewhat dim-witted, being unable to keep secrets, thus causing him to inadvertently reveal his wife&#x27;s surprise presents, and having a thick German accent.
*King Richard III of England (Peter Cook) is a fictionalised version of the real Richard III of England. The series&#x27; first episode, &quot;The Foretelling&quot;, explains that King Richard III was actually a kind, benevolent ruler who doted on his nephews, and that his popular image as a murderous usurper is based on lies spread by his rival, Henry Tudor.
*Captain Redbeard Rum (Tom Baker) – A deranged seafarer who claims to have had his legs &quot;sliced clean off by a falling sail, and swept into the sea before [my] very eyes&quot; and possesses &quot;a beard you could lose a badger in&quot;. Rum is the sole captain with, according to Sir Walter Raleigh, few enough marbles to aid Blackadder in his trip around the Cape of Good Hope, and hence captains Blackadder&#x27;s voyage of discovery – a trip that was intended to be little more than to France and back, but somehow ends up in Australia. Unlike the average seafarer, Rum actually seems to prefer drinking his own urine to water. Percy notes that Rum began doing so before the water ran out.
*Mrs. Scratchit (Pauline Melville) is a woman who appears in &quot;Blackadder&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. While seemingly a weak and sweet-natured woman, she is actually a very greedy con artist who has a &quot;crippled&quot; son called Tiny Tom, who is, in fact, morbidly obese (weighing fifteen stone and is &quot;built like a brick privy&quot;.) She starts off swindling £17 off Blackadder in return for seventeen matchsticks, claiming it is needed to feed herself and her family, claiming they are too poor to afford any meals, apart from &quot;what Grandfather can scrape from under his big toenail.&quot;
*Lord Smedley (Nigel Planer) – An extremely annoying friend of George and one half of the Scarlet Pimpernel, the other half being his friend, Lord Topper. He is killed by a suicide pill given to him by Blackadder when he is disguised as Madame Guillotine in order to rescue him and Baldrick. (&quot;Nob and Nobility&quot;)
*Brigadier Sir Bernard Proudfoot Smith (Bill Wallis) – A patient with thick German accent at the hospital in the fourth series episode &quot;General Hospital.&quot; Captain Darling thinks he is the German spy, but he is revealed at the end of the episode to be the finest spy in British Army, who picked up &quot;a teensy-veensy bit&quot; of an accent while working long-term undercover in Germany.
*Baron von Richthoven (Ade Edmondson) – A German Flying ace who imprisons Blackadder behind enemy lines in the season four episode. (&quot;Private Plane&quot;)
*Lord Topper (Tim McInnerny) – An extremely irritating friend of Prince George, he is offered the chance to go and rescue a French aristocrat by Blackadder but he refuses. He then disguises himself as Le Comte de Frou Frou and is &quot;rescued&quot; by Blackadder and Baldrick. After being captured by an evil revolutionary (Chris Barrie) and escaping, he reveals himself to be Topper and, coincidentally, one half of the Scarlet Pimpernel, the other half being his friend, Lord Smedley, who had already been killed by a suicide pill given to him by Blackadder. When he is about to tell George the truth about his &quot;rescue&quot;, he is also killed the same way as Smedley, Blackadder slipping a suicide pill into his wine. (&quot;Nob and Nobility&quot;)
*Nathaniel, Lord Whiteadder (Daniel Thorndike) and Lady Whiteadder (Miriam Margolyes) are Blackadder&#x27;s Puritanical aunt and uncle in the episode Beer. Blackadder describes them as &quot;the most fanatical Puritans in England&quot; and is pleased to get a message that they are coming to his house to discuss their &quot;whopping great inheritance.&quot; Blackadder&#x27;s meeting with them coincides with a drinking competition Melchett and some friends have challenged him to. He is, therefore, forced to hold the two dinners in separate rooms. Despite his infamous Puritanism, he secretly breaks his vow of silence to thank Blackadder for a fantastic evening (following mishaps involving a phallic turnip, a drunken Edmund and Percy (who he believes to be a jester).)
*The Wise Woman (Barbara Miller) – A &quot;deranged druid&quot; (according to Blackadder) who Baldrick habitually used to cure medical complaints. Out of desperation, Blackadder decided to brave the &quot;swampy wilderness&quot; of Putney and seek her counsel to cure him of his &quot;homosexuality&quot; when he found himself attracted to &quot;Bob&quot;. She recommends Blackadder sleep with &quot;him&quot;, as that is what she tends to do with people she is attracted to — although she has to drug them first, due to her being &quot;so old and warty&quot;. Her subsequent alternative solutions are met with equal disdain; Blackadder vehemently refuses to kill &#x27;Bob&#x27;, declines the suggestion to kill himself, and treats the solution of killing everybody in the whole world — thus preventing anyone from learning his secret — with disdain. (&quot;Bells&quot;)
*The Witchsmeller Pursuivant (Frank Finlay) – During the episode &quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot;, plague breaks out and reports of strange and unexplained phenomena, such as &quot;two women claiming to have been raped by a fish&quot;, abound. The council of Lords recommends that &quot;The Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot; be sent for, in order to track down and eliminate the presumed cause of the ill omens. After Edmund mocks the Witchsmeller by referring to him as &quot;Old Big-nose&quot;, the Witchsmeller tricks Edmund into incriminating himself as a witch. During the ensuing trial, Edmund, Percy and Baldrick are found guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to be burned at the stake. However, the Queen provides Edmund with an apparent voodoo-doll of the Witchsmeller, which falls into the fire when Edmund is about to be burned, resulting in the Witchsmeller dying himself and Edmund being apparently cleared.

<text>Preben Elkjær Larsen (; born 11 September 1957) is a Danish former professional footballer who played as a striker.

Amongst others, he played with Hellas Verona in Italy, helping the club to the only major title of its history, the 1985 Serie A. Additionally, Elkjær scored 38 goals for the Denmark national team in 11 years, being a leading figure for the Danish side under coach Sepp Piontek that played at the Euro 1984 and the 1986 World Cup (a first-ever appearance), often hailed as the golden generation of Danish football by their countrymen. Elkjær won the Bronze Ball award at the latter competition. 
Widely regarded as one of the best forwards of the 1980s, Elkjær finished second in the Ballon d&#x27;Or awards in 1985, having been placed third the previous year, and going on to finish fourth in 1986. In Verona he is still remembered fondly, having earned the persisting nickname &quot;Il sindaco&quot; (the mayor) during his stint for the club. To this day, at least a few hundred voters in the city continue to write his name on their ballots at the mayoral elections. Renowned for his goal-scoring abilities and persona, he also remains one of the most popular sports personalities in his native Denmark. A well-known story in Copenhagen states that during the celebrations of the Danish qualification for the 1986 World Cup, religious graffiti emerged on a wall in Copenhagen, asking &quot;What would we do if Jesus returned tomorrow?&quot;. Over night, an answer had been sprayed on the wall replying &quot;Then we&#x27;ll move Elkjær out wide&quot;.

==Club career==

===Germany and Belgium===
Born 11 September 1957, in Copenhagen, Elkjær&#x27;s career started with Vanløse IF in 1976, where he stayed for just one season, playing 15 games and scoring seven goals. He then joined 1. FC Köln in Germany, at the time one of Europe&#x27;s leading clubs. With the team, he won the 1978 domestic Cup (his entire campaign consisted of nine minutes in the final, against Hertha BSC), but never got on with the manager or the harsh, disciplined atmosphere of a German dressing room, and eventually left. One falling out with the coach Hennes Weisweiler earned a legendary status in Denmark: Weisweiler approached Elkjær and said that he had been informed that the player had spent the early-morning hours at a nightclub in the company of a bottle of whiskey and a lady, and wanted to know if that was true. Elkjær replied that it was a lie; in fact it was a bottle of vodka and &quot;two&quot; ladies.

In February 1978, Elkjær moved to K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen in Belgium where he stayed for six years, the longest spell at any club during his entire career. There, he earned two nicknames: &quot;Chefen fra Lokeren&quot; (Lit: The Boss from Lokeren) and &quot;Den Gale Mand fra Lokeren&quot; (Lit: The Crazy Man from Lokeren), surpassing the 100-goal mark in official matches (98 in the Belgian First Division alone).

===Verona===
Twenty-seven-year-old Elkjær signed for Hellas Verona F.C. in Italy in the summer of 1984 and, in his first season with the team, he played an instrumental role as it won the Serie A title, the &quot;scudetto&quot;, for the first time in its history; he aided that conquest with a solo left-flank run against Juventus (a 2–0 home win), where he lost his right boot, kept on running with the ball and ended up shooting home with his bootless right foot. That season, Elkjær was Hellas Verona&#x27;s most costly player purchase. 

In 1984, Elkjær finished third and in 1985 second in the European Footballer of the Year awards, both times surpassed by Michel Platini, who played for Juventus. During his four-year spell at Verona, he never scored ten league goals in a season, but never netted fewer than seven goals, for a total of 48 official goals.

===Return to Denmark and retirement===
In 1988, Elkjær made a comeback in Danish football with Vejle BK. He came to the club as the biggest star in the country, and attracted great crowds to the club&#x27;s matches. Aged 31, he suffered a number of injuries while at Vejle, and had a hard time living up to the high expectations of the crowds, eventually retiring two years later, having only appeared in a total of 26 matches combined.

==International career==
While playing youth football for Frederiksberg Boldklub, Elkjær made his debut for the Danish under-19 national team, in October 1975. He played a total 11 games and scored six goals for the under-19 national team, including three in three games at the 1975 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship.

Elkjær made his debut for the under-21s in June 1976, scoring nine times in as many games; this included three goals in the quarter-finals of the 1978 European Under-21 Championship against Bulgaria, though Denmark were eliminated on the away goals rule.

On 22 June 1977, aged 19 years and 284 days, Elkjær made his debut for the senior national team, scoring both goals in a 2–1 win against Finland. He played a prominent role in UEFA Euro 1984, scoring two goals in four games, which helped pave the way for his move to Italian football. During the tournament, Denmark played attractive attacking football, but went out at the semi-final stage, losing to Spain on penalties. Elkjær missed Denmark&#x27;s last penalty kick attempt, sending the ball high over the goal.

Elkjær also represented Denmark at the 1986 FIFA World Cup as Denmark had qualified for that competition for the first time, eventually progressing from the group stage as winners, only to be once again knocked out by Spain. During the tournament, he scored four goals, including a hat-trick against Uruguay, being named the most dynamic and powerful striker of the tournament, and winning the Bronze Ball award as the third best player.

Euro 1988 was Elkjær&#x27;s last tournament participation for him. On 14 June 1988, he played the last game for his country, aged 30 years and 277 days, as Denmark lost 2–0 to West Germany, finishing with three group stage defeats. In total, he played 69 international games, and scored 38 goals.

==Style of play==
Elkjær is regarded as one of Denmark&#x27;s all-time greatest forwards. A notorious smoker, his playing style was, however, not short of breath, being dominated by a rock-like determination. He never seemed to give up on a lost ball – from time to time resulting in a goal.

His style was an unorthodox combination of physical confrontations and great dribbling abilities. Described as &quot;powerful and dynamic&quot;, Elkjær could hardly be stopped when going on his own, one of his trademarks. His aggression was matched by few, and whenever he would receive the ball with his back to the goal he would immediately turn with the ball and attempt to head for goal.

Elkjær&#x27;s aggressive style of play paired well with the calmness and vision of the younger Michael Laudrup when they played side by side on the national team, and they were named the &quot;most effective&quot; attacking duo of the 1986 World Cup.

At Hellas Verona, Preben Elkjær was one of the few players in the Serie A that didn&#x27;t have a specific role. Other than being expected to score goals, he was mostly given a carte blanche by coach Osvaldo Bagnoli. 

== Personal life ==
Elkjær authored an autobiography, &quot;Guldkjær&quot;. He was nicknamed both &quot;Guldkjær&quot; and &quot;Målkjær&quot;, Danish for, respectively, &quot;Goldkjær&quot; and &quot;Goalkjær&quot;. In the book, he mostly recalls his stay in Italy with Hellas Verona. 

Elkjær had several cars. One of them was a Porsche. He received the car as a token of gratefulness from the waiter at a restaurant after he helped Hellas Verona capture the Scudetto. To this day, Verona&#x27;s 1985 Scudetto is their only one.

After the 1984 Euros, where Denmark made it to the semi-finals, the Danish ministre of culture, Mimi Stilling Jacobsen, asked Elkjær to dance at a reception. He agreed.

==Retirement==
After his retirement from playing, Elkjær took on the job as head coach of Silkeborg IF in the &quot;Danish Superliga&quot; in 1995. 
In December 1996, he left the club to head TV sports channel &quot;TVS&quot;, a newly formed corporation between national TV stations DR and TV2, the Danish Football Association and telecompany Tele Danmark. The station was not a success, and was closed within a year of its opening.

Additionally, he works as a UEFA Champions League pundit for Danish TV3+, alongside Michael Laudrup and host Peter Grønborg. In October 2019 he had an operation to remove a gallstone in Belgium.

<text>David Peter Bergland (June 4, 1935 – June 3, 2019) was an American politician who was the United States Libertarian Party&#x27;s nominee for President of the United States in the 1984 presidential election, and also served twice as the chair of the Libertarian National Committee.

==Background==
Bergland was born June 4, 1935, in Mapleton, Iowa, the son of Gwendolyn (née McCalman) and Cedores P. Bergland.

==Political campaigns and activities==
A resident of California and a lawyer, Bergland ran unsuccessfully for office several times, always as a Libertarian. In 1974, he ran as a write-in candidate for California Attorney General. In 1978, Bergland ran for the California state senate district 36, receiving 5.8% of the vote to finish third out of the three candidates on the ballot.

Bergland received the party&#x27;s vice-presidential nomination in the 1976 presidential election, sharing the ticket with Roger MacBride. The MacBride/Bergland ticket received 172,553 votes (0.2%).

He served as the party&#x27;s national chair from 1977 to 1981, and from 1998 to 2000.

In 1980, Bergland ran for the United States Senate, finishing third of five with 202,410 votes (2.4%).

Bergland received the Libertarian Party&#x27;s presidential nomination in the 1984 presidential election. He and his running mate, Jim Lewis, received 228,111 votes (0.3%).

He managed the 2000 Libertarian presidential campaign of Harry Browne. Bergland endorsed the Free State Project in January 2006.

==Views==
In the 1980s, Bergland wrote a book entitled, &quot;Libertarianism in One Lesson&quot; (). The book explained the libertarian philosophy and touched on issues including the government as a nature of coercion, how libertarianism developed in America and how it is different from both liberalism and conservatism, the contention that taxation is theft, support of a foreign policy of non-intervention, free trade with other countries, gun rights, and criminal justice reform, opposition to drug and alcohol prohibition, public education, and Social Security.

==Death==
Bergland died on June 3, 2019, in Kennewick, Washington, one day short of his 84th birthday, of prostate cancer.

<text>Rings Around the World is the fifth studio album and the major label debut by Super Furry Animals. Released on 23 July 2001 by Epic Records in the United Kingdom, it was the first album by any artist to be simultaneously released on both audio CD and DVD. The record reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart and includes the singles &quot;Juxtapozed with U&quot;, &quot;(Drawing) Rings Around the World&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Not the End of the World?&quot;.

The album, which singer Gruff Rhys describes as &quot;a very ambitious project&quot;, was recorded between April and September 2000 at Monnow Valley Studios in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales and Bearsville Studios, New York with the band acting as co-producers alongside Chris Shaw. The majority of the songs on &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; were written by Rhys on guitar and piano with keyboardist Cian Ciaran contributing &quot;[A] Touch Sensitive&quot; and &quot;Miniature&quot; as well as collaborating with other members of the band on &quot;Run! Christian, Run!&quot;, &quot;Alternate Route to Vulcan Street&quot; and &quot;No Sympathy&quot;. Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and former Velvet Underground member John Cale make cameo appearances on the album.

Musically &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; is an eclectic record incorporating pop, prog, punk, jungle, electronica, techno and death metal. Rhys has offered several explanations of the album&#x27;s lyrical content, claiming the record is &quot;about Earth, and the pollution of space&quot; and also that it addresses the human condition. Critics meanwhile have referred to the record as &quot;thematically eccentric&quot; and lacking an &quot;overarching theme&quot;. Critical reception was generally positive, with the album being nominated for 2001&#x27;s Mercury Music Prize and placing at #1 in &quot;Mojo&#x27;s&quot; &quot;best albums of 2001&quot; feature. Some reviews claimed it to be the best record of the band&#x27;s career although the &quot;NME&quot; described it as the band&#x27;s worst album.

==Origins and recording==

&quot;Rings Around the World&quot; was the Super Furry Animals&#x27; first album for Epic Records following the demise, in 1999, of their previous label Creation and the success of 2000&#x27;s &quot;Mwng&quot;, which was issued on the band&#x27;s own label, Placid Casual. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that the band aimed to make a &quot;laid back and sort of wiped clean&quot; record with &quot;Rings...&quot;. In a 2008 interview with &quot;Uncut&quot; Rhys described the album as &quot;a very ambitious project&quot; stating that &quot;We were trying to make a blockbuster album that was going to be like The Eagles ... We were trying to make utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting.&quot; &quot;Rings...&quot; was originally going to be called &quot;Text Messaging is Destroying the Pub Quiz as We Know It&quot; and released as a double album containing 75–90 minutes of material with Rhys stating that he was &quot;into the excess of it, that was the whole point&quot;. The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of &quot;Rings...&quot;, making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.

Recording sessions began in April 2000 at Monnow Valley Studios in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales with co-producer Chris Shaw and engineer Eric Tew. The band moved to Bearsville Studios, New York before returning to Monnow Valley some months later where recording was completed in September 2000. Bearsville was chosen because of its drum and live rooms, which the band felt were desirable as they were using more microphones to capture audio for the surround sound mix included on the DVD version of the album than they would normally when simply recording in stereo. The group were mindful of the capabilities of surround sound and recorded sub-bass on tracks such as &quot;[A] Touch Sensitive&quot; and &quot;Juxtapozed with U&quot;, which could only be heard through a low-frequency subwoofer channel in the surround mix. The band recorded onto two-inch analogue tape until they had a take they were happy with, then transferred the results to Pro Tools where individual songs were edited and overdubs were added. According to Keyboardist Cian Ciaran this meant the band could &quot;edit some beats very precisely ... like the gated kicks at the end of the track &quot;Sidewalk Serfer Girl&quot;&quot;. Once they were happy with a song the group then transferred it back to tape before mixing took place as they liked the &quot;tape sound&quot;.

Rhys wrote many of the tracks on the album on acoustic guitar and piano and brought them to the band either as fully formed songs or as ideas which the group would then jam out. Ciaran wrote the songs &quot;[A] Touch Sensitive&quot; and &quot;Miniature&quot; and the intro and outro of &quot;Run! Christian, Run!&quot;. A jam between Cian and guitarist Huw Bunford resulted in &quot;Rings Around the World&#x27;s&quot; opening track &quot;Alternate Route to Vulcan Street&quot;. The pair looped a sample of drummer Dafydd Ieuan playing the bass drum and snare and recorded themselves playing along on piano and guitar into a sampler. They then &quot;chopped the playing up a bit&quot; and filtered the drums and guitar to &quot;give them more movement&quot;. Finally Rhys wrote lyrics and a string arrangement was added by Sean O&#x27;Hagan. Cian also contributed the second part of the song &quot;No Sympathy&quot;, sampling the &quot;mellow acoustic guitars&quot; from the first half to create a techno &quot;climactic ending&quot;.

Sessions for &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; saw the band concentrating on arrangements, particularly their vocal harmonies. On previous albums individual members of the group would &quot;keep singing until [they] came up with harmonies that worked&quot; but, encouraged by co-producer Chris Shaw, for &quot;Rings...&quot; the band took the time to work out harmonies in advance. The group used piano, keyboards or &quot;whatever was available&quot; to give themselves a starting note before the five band members and staff at the recording studio began trying ideas out. Occasionally Auto-Tune was used to &quot;re-pitch existing lines to see if different versions of them would counterpoint correctly&quot;, with the band then learning the new vocal lines and recording them as they did not want to use Auto-Tune on the finished album.

Paul McCartney is credited as providing &quot;celery and carrot&quot; on the track &quot;Receptacle for the Respectable&quot;. McCartney is alleged to have performed a similar role over thirty years earlier, chewing celery to form the percussion track of The Beach Boys song &quot;Vegetables&quot; from the album &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. The Super Furry Animals had met the ex-Beatle at the NME Awards when a drunk Ciaran persuaded him to let them remix some Beatles material, resulting in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Liverpool Sound Collage&quot; album. The band asked him to &quot;return the favour&quot; and appear on &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, recording his part over the phone. Huw Bunford has said of McCartney&#x27;s contribution: &quot;He took it with good nature. You kind of see how far you can go sometimes ... we figured we already had a bass and singers so we really didn&#x27;t need any more musicians. So we figured he could crunch vegetables&quot;. Former Velvet Underground member John Cale, a &quot;sort of childhood hero&quot; of Rhys&#x27;s, also makes an appearance on the album, playing piano on the song &quot;Presidential Suite&quot;. The Super Furry Animals had met Cale in Cardiff when they acted as his backing band for a song which appeared on the film &quot;Beautiful Mistake&quot;. They originally asked him to arrange strings for &quot;Presidential Suite&quot; but Cale turned them down reasoning that he would simply do what the band do: hum a melody to someone who could write the music down for him.

== Musical style ==

&quot;Rings Around the World&quot; is &quot;very cinematic&quot; and falls somewhere between the Super Furry Animals&#x27; 1999 album, the &quot;instantaneous, easy to grasp, and almost disposable&quot; &quot;Guerrilla&quot;, and its &quot;exact opposite&quot;, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Mwng&quot;. The band combined the technology they used for the former with the simplicity of the latter, which featured &quot;just the band playing in the studio&quot;. Singer Gruff Rhys has described the album as the band&#x27;s &quot;cosmic rock record&quot;.

The album is a &quot;kaleidoscopic blend of pop, prog, punk, psych, and electronica&quot;. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; describes it as similar to &quot;Guerrilla&quot; with &quot;Beach Boys-esque psychedelic pop ... put to techno undertones&quot; while the &quot;NME&quot; has called &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; an &quot;expensive, glossy production ... lush and widescreen&quot; and suggested that it &quot;reaches for an effect so modern that at times it sounds like it could&#x27;ve been made in the &#x27;80s&quot;. The first single, &quot;Juxtapozed with U&quot;, is reminiscent of both the Philadelphia soul music of the 1970s, and the &quot;plastic&quot; approximation of that music on David Bowie&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Young Americans&quot;, while &quot;No Sympathy&quot; has been described as the &quot;missing link between Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young-scatted harmonies, jungle hi-hats and berserk sampler techno&quot;. The &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; compared &quot;It&#x27;s Not the End of the World?&quot; to tunes such as The Kinks&#x27; &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, Dennis Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Forever&quot; and Jack Bruce&#x27;s &quot;Theme for an Imaginary Western&quot; while &quot;The Big Issue&quot; called &quot;Sidewalk Serfer Girl&quot; &quot;surf-punk electro pop&quot;. Elsewhere on the album the eclectic range of sounds continues from the trip hop of &quot;[A] Touch Sensitive&quot; to the Status Quo-esque &quot;(Drawing) Rings Around the World&quot; and the &quot;electro country rock&quot; of &quot;Run! Christian, Run!&quot;.

The track &quot;Receptacle For the Respectable&quot; reflects the eclecticism of the album as it &quot;undergoes a complete personality change&quot; over the course of its four-minute thirty-two-second duration, veering from prog rock to death metal. The song begins as an acoustic guitar-driven pop song and then shifts into a slower bridge section which leads to an even slower coda which has been compared to the music of Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; album and features Paul McCartney chewing carrots and celery to the beat. The track ends with a &quot;pantomime death metal&quot; section with Rhys&#x27;s &quot;distorted, bellowed vocals&quot; screaming the title phrase. According to Cian Ciaran, the song initially comprised just the first two parts when recorded at Monnow Valley Studios but, by the time the group relocated to Bearsville Studios, Rhys had written and added the third section. While there the band added the fourth section by &quot;pissing about with Pro Tools&quot;, looping the bass from the end of the third section &quot;by accident&quot; to create the musical backing. A fifth, hip hop, section was discussed but the band decided against it, reasoning that &quot;if you&#x27;re going to do a fifth bit, you&#x27;d probably do a sixth, and before you know where you are, you&#x27;re doing a concept album made up of nothing but bits!&quot;. According to the band, the track is the only time on the album where they tried to achieve comedy and &quot;completely went with [their] silly streak&quot;.

==Lyrical themes==

Singer and chief lyric writer Gruff Rhys has given several explanations of the lyrical themes present on the album. He has claimed that the record is &quot;about Earth, and the pollution of space: it&#x27;s about debris&quot; and that it was originally going to be a &quot;state of the planet concept album&quot; before the band decided against it. Rhys has also stated that the album is about the human condition, citing tracks such as &quot;Fragile Happiness&quot; and &quot;Receptacle For The Respectable&quot; as examples. Critics have referred to the album as &quot;thematically eccentric&quot; and lacking an &quot;overarching theme&quot; with &quot;The Independent&quot; claiming it leaps &quot;from religious fundamentalists to modern telecommunications and the old Hollywood star system with disorienting glee&quot;.

In contrast with 1999&#x27;s &quot;Guerrilla&quot;, which featured songs with &quot;self-consciously disposable, happy&quot; lyrics, the tracks on &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; are, according to Rhys, &quot;broodier and more revealing&quot;. The track &quot;No Sympathy&quot; was originally written for a film entitled &quot;Plop&quot;, which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week as though it were their last. Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary. &quot;Presidential Suite&quot;, about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, is &quot;a reflective look back at the decadent nineties&quot; during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if &quot;we need to know if he really came inside her mouth?&quot;. &quot;Juxtapozed with U&quot; addresses social injustice and is about &quot;house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich&quot; and has been described by Rhys as &quot;grotesque in its upness and lift&quot;. &quot;Sidewalk Serfer Girl&quot; was initially written about Patti White Bull, a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years, awaking in 1999, but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs, including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports. &quot;Receptacle for the Respectable&quot; is about simultaneously being in awe of, and being hurt by, a &quot;girl around town&quot; while &quot;It&#x27;s Not the End of the World?&quot; is &quot;a romantic song about growing old&quot;. &quot;Run! Christian, Run!&quot; was influenced by guitarist Huw Bunford&#x27;s interest in &quot;doomsday cult websites&quot;. Bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to Rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching Christian television shows during the band&#x27;s American tours. The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;(Drawing) Rings Around the World&quot;, is based on an idea put forward by Rhys&#x27; girlfriend&#x27;s father and is about &quot;all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around&quot;. &quot;Shoot Doris Day&quot; refers to shooting American singer and actress Doris Day with film—&quot;a very cinematic reference&quot; for a song which Rhys claims is &quot;over-the-top lyrically&quot;. The track is about &quot;how people change&quot; and also references Labour Party &#x27;spin doctor&#x27; Peter Mandelson, in the guise of &#x27;Victor Panache&#x27;.

==DVD==

The DVD of &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; contains the 13 songs featured on the album, along with 5 bonus tracks. These 18 songs are presented in surround sound and are accompanied by &quot;low budget&quot; music videos. The release also includes 16 remixes and interactive menus featuring ambient music created by the band. According to 
keyboard player Cian Ciaran the group were worried that &quot;doing a DVD might seem elitist, because only certain people have DVD players and systems, even now&quot; but reasoned that &quot;most people will have DVD playback systems at home within five years. Even if it doesn&#x27;t take off, the stereo version of the album will always be there&quot;. The DVD release received a &#x27;15&#x27; certificate from the British Board of Film Classification, meaning that no-one under the age of 15 could buy or rent it in the United Kingdom.

Ciaran has stated that the Super Furry Animals were &quot;very hands-on&quot; during the making of the DVD. Initially the band were mainly concerned with the sound quality, describing the presentation of the album&#x27;s tracks in surround sound as &quot;radical, like the change from mono to stereo&quot;. The group directed the surround sound mix themselves, instructing audio engineers to move instruments and vocal parts between speakers: &quot;We want that one bit of sound to travel from the centre, over our heads and finish on my right shoulder ... Let&#x27;s have the main vocal in the middle, then each harmony in its own speaker.&quot; They soon became equally as interested in the remixes, visuals and interactive elements however. Ciaran has described this process as &quot;not always a nice position to be in&quot; when, for example, they had to reject music videos they weren&#x27;t happy with. The band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album &quot;Guerrilla&quot; themselves. According to singer Gruff Rhys the band &quot;tended to go for illustrators who could [make videos] cheaply using Flash ... and artists who like to work&quot;. The directors were asked to make the visuals as &quot;extreme as possible&quot; in an effort to avoid making videos that looked like just &quot;another pop promo ... like MTV&quot; and, according to Ciaran, had to &quot;work even harder at creating something interesting&quot; due to the limited budget available. Many of those who made videos for the DVD release had no previous experience of making films resulting in a &quot;really fresh ... kind of scruffy&quot; end product. According to Rhys the band made separate music videos for &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;&#x27;s three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as &quot;pure art&quot; whereas they needed promotional videos that were more like adverts for the songs. Rhys has stated that the Super Furry Animals felt that fans placed too much emphasis on the videos on &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; rather than concentrating on the music, as a result of which the band used &quot;really bland images&quot; on the DVD release of their next album &quot;Phantom Power&quot;.

Although he enjoyed having so much control over the project Ciaran has claimed that it &quot;sometimes felt like it would never end&quot; and he was glad to get back to &quot;the music side of things&quot; upon the DVD&#x27;s completion. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that he found being involved with all aspects of the DVD release &quot;really exciting&quot; and particularly enjoyed working with &quot;so many people&quot;.

==Release==

&quot;Rings Around the World&quot; was released on CD, vinyl, MiniDisc and DVD on 23 July 2001 in the United Kingdom on Sony&#x27;s Epic imprint and was the world&#x27;s first simultaneous album/DVD release. The record reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart. In America &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; was released on 19 March 2002 by XL Recordings with a bonus CD featuring seven tracks which appear on the DVD version of the album. &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; was released on 25 September 2001 in Japan with two additional tracks, &quot;Tradewinds&quot; and &quot;Happiness Is a Worn Pun&quot;, added after &quot;Fragile Happiness&quot; at the end of the album. &quot;Juxtapozed with U&quot; was released as the first single from the album, reaching number 14 in the UK Singles Chart, followed by &quot;(Drawing) Rings Around the World&quot; in October 2001 which peaked at number 28. The third and final single to be taken from the album, &quot;It&#x27;s Not the End of the World?&quot;, was released in January 2002 and reached number 30 in the UK Singles Chart. The album has been certified gold in the United Kingdom, denoting sales of more than 100,000 copies.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rings Around the World&quot; received praise from critics with a score of 86 on Metacritic, denoting &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that the album&#x27;s combination of &quot;paisley, sun-heated, and layered&quot; music with Gruff Rhys&#x27;s &quot;satirical and heartfelt lyrics&quot; makes it &quot;timeless&quot; and the band&#x27;s best record. Adrian Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the record &quot;near-perfect&quot; and wrote that &quot;we should be thankful there are bands out there willing to throw everything they&#x27;ve got into a record just to see what happens&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; praised its &quot;accessible and adventurous&quot; nature, while &quot;The Independent&quot; opined that &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; &quot;represents a quantum jump beyond the Furries&#x27; previous work&quot; and described it as &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most engrossing – and, crucially, most entertaining – albums&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; stated that &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; was the band&#x27;s &quot;first truly flawless album&quot; and later named it the best album of 2001. &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; called &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; &quot;one of the, if not the, best releases of 2002&quot;, describing it as a &quot;mixture of sugar pop of yesteryear and modern Britpop&quot; resulting in a &quot;near perfect&quot; album. &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; was later nominated for 2001&#x27;s Mercury Music Prize.

In a review for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, Scott Plagenhoef wrote that on &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, the band are &quot;gleefully working outside of a scene or prototype&quot; and &quot;dabbling in a world of musical influences and Western hegemony, playing the merry prankster to Radiohead&#x27;s gloom – and all with a smile, and in three-part harmony&quot;. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the record, claiming that it &quot;shines brightly&quot; compared to the &quot;dead world of mainstream and indie rock in 2001&quot; but expressed disappointment that it is &quot;the first SFA album not to progress from its predecessor&quot;. Rob Brunner of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; claimed that at its best, the album &quot;recalls a lost Brian Wilson-style psychedelic marvel&quot;, but went on to state that it is &quot;at times marred by forced eccentricity&quot;, citing the &quot;heavy metal gorgon voice booming through &#x27;Receptacle for the Respectable&#x27;&quot; and the &quot;awful lite-rock homage&quot; &quot;Juxtapozed with U&quot; as examples. &quot;Q&quot; stated that, although songs such as &quot;(Drawing) Rings Around the World&quot;, &quot;Shoot Doris Day&quot; and &quot;Presidential Suite&quot; are &quot;excellent&quot;, the album features &quot;nothing to change anyone&#x27;s world&quot;, while the &quot;NME&quot; claimed that, despite containing some great songs, it is the band&#x27;s worst album. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; singled out &quot;Tradewinds&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, indicating a &quot;good song on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money.&quot;

<text>5,000,000 (*Tortelvis Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong) is Dread Zeppelin&#x27;s second full-length album. Recorded in early fall 1990, it was conceived and recorded during a three-week break from touring to support the surprisingly successful &quot;Un-Led-Ed.&quot; Produced by Jah Paul Jo and Rasta Li-Mon, the album once again featured their patented &quot;Zeppelin-Inna-Reggae-Style&quot; hybrid plus 3 original songs and a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Stir It Up&quot; and &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; by The Yardbirds. The album was released worldwide by I.R.S. Records in 1991.

The title is a reference to the Elvis Presley album &quot;50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;. The cover image is an homage to the Led Zeppelin album &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;.

==&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot;==
Producer/guitarist Jah Paul Jo had said that they left &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; off of &quot;Un Led-Ed&quot; on purpose so people would have to buy the second album, too.

&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was edited to be released as a single in the UK (vinyl and CD format). It was also offered as a 3&quot; CD in Japan. Dread Zeppelin&#x27;s version of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; is the B-side of the UK single.

A video to promote &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was proposed but never finished due to copyright considerations. The concept was a take-off on the Japanese film &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;, with a gargantuan Tortelvis fighting Godzilla. Many of Dread Zeppelin&#x27;s 1991 Japanese performances were filmed for inclusion in the video, but it was never completed.

&quot;Stir It Up&quot; by Bob Marley also got the Dread Zeppelin treatment. &quot;Stir it up, Charlie... put it in a blender and get real gone,&quot; vocalist Tortelvis is heard to mutter on the fade. The song also features electric sitar and a Moog Synthesizer the band claimed to find in Dave Stewart&#x27;s (Eurythmics) attic.

A video of &quot;Stir It Up&quot; was released in 1991 to promote the album. In it, various members of Dread Zeppelin appear as themselves and also as a backup singing group (The Michael Jordanaires) and Tortelvis as Bingo Master in Lederhosen at an Elk&#x27;s Lodge.

==Album cover==
Instead of the mystic man holding sticks on the cover of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, &quot;5,000,000&quot; has Tortelvis&#x27; towel and water man, Charlie Haj holding various pool cues and cleaning gear. The inside of the album is a telethon with people manning the telephones and the band posing beside a large-size mock up of a check. The credits for the album are pictured as a tear-stained thank-you speech presumably never given.

In the US, the cover is in color on the outside but black and white on the inside. UK and Japanese versions are full color inside and out.

In the UK, the album was released on vinyl and CD.

<text>Behāfarīd (Middle Persian: &quot;Weh-āfrīd&quot;, , also spelled &quot;Bihāfarīd&quot;) was an 8th-century Persian Zoroastrian heresiarch who started a religious peasant revolt with elements from Zoroastrianism and Islam. He believed in Zoroaster and upheld all Zoroastrian institutions. His followers prayed seven times a day facing the Sun, prohibited intoxicants, and kept their hair long and disallowed sacrifices of cattle except when they were decrepit. His revolt was quelled by the Abbasid general Abu Muslim, and he was executed by hanging. His followers, however, believed that he would descend again. Some of his followers joined the Ustadh Sis movement.

<text>Sant Tukaram Maharaj (Marathi pronunciation: ), also known as Tuka, Tukobaraya, Tukoba, was a Hindu, Marathi Saint of Varkari sampradaya in Dehu village, Maharashtra in the 17th century. He was a &quot;bhakt&quot; of the god Vithoba, also known as Vitthal, of Pandharpur. He is best known for his devotional poetry called Abhanga, which are popular in Maharashtra, many of his poems deal with social reform. His poems are included in the school and college syllabuses prominently in the state of Maharashtra.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Tukaram was born in modern-day Maharashtra state of India. His complete name was Tukaram Bolhoba Ambile.
He spent most of his later years in devotional worship, community kirtans (group prayers with singing) and composing Abhanga poetry.

Tukaram pointed out the evil of wrongdoings of society, social system and Maharajs by his and . He faced some opposition in society because of this. A man named Mambaji harassed him a lot, he was running a in Dehu and had some followers. Initially Tukaram gave him the job of doing puja at his temple, but he was jealous of Tukaram by seeing Tukaram getting respect among the village people. He once hit Tukaram by thorn&#x27;s stick. He used foul language against Tukaram. Later Mambaji also became admirer of Tukaram. He became his devotee.
Tukaram met Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj – a leader who founded the Maratha Empire; Their continued interaction is the subject of legends. Eleanor Zelliot states that Bhakti movement poets including Tukaram were influential in Shivaji&#x27;s rise to power. It is also happened that Tukaram Maharaj saved Chhatrapati Shivaji&#x27;s life from the chasing Mughals.

It is agreed by historians that Saint Tukaram died in 1650.

== Philosophy and practices ==

===Vedanta===

In his work of &quot;Abhangas&quot;, Tukarama repeatedly refers to four people who had a primary influence on his spiritual development, namely the earlier Bhakti Sants &quot;Namdev&quot;, &quot;Dnyaneshwar&quot;, &quot;Kabir&quot; and &quot;Eknath&quot;. Early 20th-century scholars on Tukaram considered his teachings to be Vedanta-based but lacking a systematic theme. JF Edwards wrote,
Late 20th-century scholarship of Tukaram, and translations of his &quot;Abhanga&quot; poem, affirm his pantheistic Vedantic view. Tukaram&#x27;s Abhanga 2877, as translated by Shri Gurudev Ranade of Nimbal states, for example, &quot;The Vedanta has said that the whole universe is filled by God. All sciences have proclaimed that God has filled the whole world. The Puranas have unmistakably taught the universal immanence of God. The sants have told us that the world is filled by God. Tuka indeed is playing in the world uncontaminated by it like the Sun which stands absolutely transcendent&quot;.

Scholars note the often discussed controversy, particularly among Marathi people, whether Tukaram subscribed to the monistic Vedanta philosophy of Adi Shankara. Bhandarkar notes that Abhanga 300, 1992 and 2482 attributed to Tukaram are in style and philosophy of Adi Shankara:

However, scholars also note that other Abhangas attributed to Tukaram criticize monism, and favor dualistic Vedanta philosophy of the Indian philosophers Madhvacharya and Ramanuja. In Abhanga 1471, according to Bhandarkar&#x27;s translation, Tukaram says, &quot;When monism is expounded without faith and love, the expounder as well as the hearer are troubled and afflicted. He who calls himself Brahma and goes on in his usual way, should not be spoken to and is a buffoon. The shameless one who speaks heresy in opposition to the Vedas is an object of scorn among holy men.&quot;

Tukaram denounced mechanical rites, rituals, sacrifices, vows and instead encouraged direct form of bhakti (devotion).

=== Kirtan ===
Tukaram encouraged kirtan as a music imbued, community-oriented group singing and dancing form of bhakti. He considered kirtan not just a means to learn about Bhakti, but Bhakti itself. The greatest merit in kirtan, according to Tukaram, is it being not only a spiritual path for the devotee, it helps create a spiritual path for others.

=== Social reforms ===

Tukaram accepted disciples and devotees without discriminating on the basis of gender. One of his celebrated devotees was Bahina Bai, a Brahmin woman, who faced anger and abuse of her husband when she chose Bhakti marga and Tukaram as her &quot;guru&quot;.

Tukaram taught, states Ranade, that &quot;pride of caste never made any man holy&quot;, &quot;the Vedas and Shastras have said that for the service of God, castes do not matter&quot;, &quot;castes do not matter, it is God&#x27;s name that matters&quot;, and &quot;an outcast who loves the Name of God is verily a Brahmin; in him have tranquility, forbearance, compassion and courage made their home&quot;. However, early 20th century scholars questioned whether Tukaram himself observed caste when his daughters from his second wife married men of their own caste. Fraser and Edwards, in their 1921 review of Tukaram, stated that this is not necessarily so, because people in the West too generally prefer relatives to marry those of their own economic and social strata.

David Lorenzen states that the acceptance, efforts and reform role of Tukaram in the &quot;Varakari-sampraday&quot; follows the diverse caste and gender distributions found in Bhakti movements across India. The rest include ten Brahmins and two whose caste origins are unknown. Of the twenty one, four women are celebrated as sant, born in two Brahmin and two non-Brahmin families. Tukaram&#x27;s effort at social reforms within &quot;Varakari-sampraday&quot; must be viewed in this historical context and as part of the overall movement, states Lorenzen.

== Literary works ==
Tukaram composed Abhanga poetry, a Marathi genre of literature which is metrical (traditionally the &quot;ovi&quot; meter), simple, direct, and it fuses folk stories with deeper spiritual themes.

Tukaram&#x27;s work is known for informal verses of rapturous abandon in folksy style, composed in vernacular language, in contrast to his predecessors such as Dnyandeva or Namdev known for combining similar depth of thought with a grace of style.

In one of his poems, Tukaram self-effacingly described himself as a &quot;fool, confused, lost, liking solitude because I am wearied of the world, worshipping Vitthal (Vishnu) just like my ancestors were doing but I lack their faith and devotion, and there is nothing holy about me&quot;.

&quot;Tukaram Gatha&quot; is a Marathi language compilation of his works, likely composed between 1632 and 1650. Also called &quot;Abhanga Gatha&quot;, the Indian tradition believes it includes some 4,500 &quot;abhangas&quot;. The poems considered authentic cover a wide range of human emotions and life experiences, some autobiographical, and places them in a spiritual context. He includes a discussion about the conflict between &quot;Pravritti&quot; – having passion for life, family, business, and &quot;Nivritti&quot; – the desire to renounce, leave everything behind for individual liberation, moksha.

Ranade states there are four major collations of Tukaram&#x27;s Abhanga Gathas.

=== Authenticity ===
The first compilation of Tukaram poems was published, in modern format, by Indu Prakash publishers in 1869, subsidized by the British colonial government&#x27;s Bombay Presidency. The 1869 edition noted, &quot;some of the [as received] manuscripts on which the compilation relied, had been &#x27;corrected&#x27;, &#x27;further corrected&#x27; and &#x27;arranged&#x27;.&quot; This doctoring and rewriting over about 200 years, after Tukaram&#x27;s death, has raised questions whether the modern compilation of Tukaram&#x27;s poems faithfully represents what Tukaram actually thought and said, and the historicity of the document. The known manuscripts are jumbled, randomly scattered collections, without chronological sequence, and each contains some poems that are not found in all other known manuscripts.

=== Books and translations ===
The 18th-century biographer Mahipati, in his four volume compilation of the lives of many Bhakti movement sants, included Tukaram. Mahipati&#x27;s treatise has been translated by Justin Abbott.

A translation of about 3,700 poems from Tukaram Gatha in English was published, in three volumes, between 1909 and 1915, by Fraser and Marathe. In 1922, Fraser and Edwards published his biography and religious ideas incorporating some translations of Tukaram&#x27;s poems, and included a comparison of Tukaram&#x27;s philosophy and theology with those of Christianity. Deleury, in 1956, published a metric French translation of a selection of Tukaram&#x27;s poem along with an introduction to the religious heritage of Tukaram (Deleury spells him as &quot;Toukaram&quot;).

Arun Kolatkar published, in 1966, six volumes of avant-garde translations of Tukaram poems. Ranade has published a critical biography and some selected translation.

Dilip Chitre translated writings of Sant Tukaram into English in the book titled &quot;Says Tuka&quot; for which he was awarded the &quot;Sahitya Akademi&quot; award in 1994. A selection of poems of Tukaram has been translated and published by Daniel Ladinsky.

Chandrakant Kaluram Mhatre has translated selected poems of Tukaram, published as &quot;One Hundred Poems of Tukaram&quot;.

== Legacy ==
===Maharashtra society===
Tukaram&#x27;s abhangs are very popular in Maharashtra. It became part of the culture of the state. Varkaris, poets and peoples study his poems. His poems are popular in rural Maharashtra and their popularity is increasing. Tukaram was a devotee of Vithoba &quot;(&quot;Vitthala&quot;)&quot;, an avatar of God Vishnu, synchronous with Krishna but with regional style and features. Tukaram&#x27;s literary works, along with those of sants Dnyandev, Namdev and Eknath, states Mohan Lal, are credited to have propelled Varkari tradition into pan-Indian Bhakti literature.

According to Richard Eaton, from early 14th-century when Maharashtra region came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, down to the 17th-century, the legacy of Tukaram and his poet-predecessors, &quot;gave voice to a deep-rooted collective identity among Marathi-speakers&quot;. Dilip Chitre summarizes the legacy of Tukaram and Bhakti movement sants, during this period of Hindu-Muslim wars, as transforming &quot;language of shared religion, and religion a shared language. It is they who helped to bind the Marathas together against the Mughals on the basis not of any religious ideology but of a territorial cultural identity&quot;.

===Mahatma Gandhi===
Mahatma Gandhi, in early 20th century, while under arrest in Yerwada Central Jail by the British colonial government for his non-violent movement, read and translated Tukaram&#x27;s poetry along with Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita and poems by other Bhakti movement poet-saints.

Sant Tukaram also had a profound influence on K. B. Hedgewar as the former&#x27;s quotes often found their way on the latter&#x27;s letterhead. One such letter dated April 6, 1940 bore the quote &quot;Daya tiche nanwa bhutanche palan, aanik nirdalan kantkache&quot;, meaning compassion is not only the welfare of all living beings, but also includes protecting them from harm&#x27;s way.

===Places associated with Tukaram===
Places associated with Tukaram in Dehu that exist today are:
*Tukaram Maharaj Janm Sthan Temple, Dehu – place where Tukaramji was born, around which a temple was built later
*Sant Tukaram Vaikunthstan Temple, Dehu – from where Tukaramji ascended to Vaikuntha (Abode of God) in his mortal form; there is a beautiful ghat behind this temple along the Indrayani river
*Sant Tukaram Maharaj Gatha Mandir, Dehu – modern structure; massive building housing a big statue of Tukaram; In the Gatha temple, about 4,000 abhangs (verses) created by Tukaram maharaj were carved on the walls.

===Movies and popular culture===

A number of Indian films have been made about the saint in different languages. These include:
*&quot;Tukaram&quot; (1921) silent film by Shinde.
*&quot;Sant Tukaram&quot; (1921) silent film by Kalanidhi Pictures.
*&quot;Sant Tukaram&quot; (1936) – this movie on Tukaram was screened open-air for a year, to packed audiences in Mumbai, and numerous rural people would walk very long distances to see it.
*&quot;Thukkaram&quot; (1938) in Tamil by B. N. Rao.
*&quot;Santha Thukaram&quot; (1963) in Kannada
*&quot;Sant Tukaram&quot; (1965) in Hindi
*&quot;Bhakta Tukaram&quot; (1973) in Telugu
*&quot;Tukaram&quot; (2012) in Marathi

Tukaram&#x27;s life was the subject of the 68th issue of Amar Chitra Katha, India&#x27;s largest comic book series.

Balbharti has included a poem of Tukaram in a Marathi school textbook

The government of India had issued a 100 rupee Silver commemorative coin in 2002.

<doc id="1111421" wikidata="Q5378246" url="?curid=1111421" title="English Electric KDF9">
<text>KDF9 was an early British 48-bit computer designed and built by English Electric (which in 1968 was merged into International Computers Limited (ICL)). The first machine came into service in 1964 and the last of 29 machines was decommissioned in 1980 at the National Physical Laboratory. The KDF9 was designed for, and used almost entirely in, the mathematical and scientific processing fields in 1967, nine were in use in UK universities and technical colleges. The KDF8, developed in parallel, was aimed at commercial processing workloads.

The KDF9 was an early example of a machine that directly supported multiprogramming, using offsets into its core memory to separate the programs into distinct virtual address spaces. Several operating systems were developed for the platform, including some that provided fully interactive use through PDP-8 machines acting as smart terminal servers. A number of compilers were available, notably both checkout and globally optimizing compilers for Algol 60.

==Architecture==
The logic circuits of the KDF9 were entirely solid-state. The KDF9 used transformer-coupled diode–transistor logic, built from germanium diodes, about 20,000 transistors, and about 2,000 toroid pulse transformers. They ran on a 1 MHz clock that delivered two pulses of 250 ns separated by 500 ns, in each clock cycle. The maximum configuration incorporated 32K words of 48-bit core storage (192K bytes) with a cycle time of 6 microseconds. Each word could hold a single 48-bit integer or floating-point number, two 24-bit integer or floating-point numbers, six 8-bit instruction syllables, or eight 6-bit characters. There was also provision for efficient handling of double-word (96-bit) numbers in both integer and floating-point formats. However, there was no facility for byte or character addressing, so that non-numerical work suffered by comparison. Its standard character set was a version of the Friden Flexowriter paper tape code that was oriented to Algol 60, and included unusual characters such as the Algol subscript 10. However, each other I/O device type implemented its own subset of that. Not every character that could be read from paper tape could be successfully printed, for example.

===Registers===
The CPU architecture featured three register sets. The &quot;Nest&quot; was a 16-deep pushdown stack of arithmetic registers, The &quot;SJNS&quot; (Subroutine Jump Nesting Store) was a similar stack of return addresses. The &quot;Q Store&quot; was a set of 16 index registers, each of 48 bits divided into &quot;Counter&quot; (C), &quot;Increment&quot; (I) and &quot;Modifier&quot; (M) parts of 16 bits each. Flags on a memory-reference instruction specified whether the address should be modified by the M part of a Q Store, and, if so, whether the C part should be decremented by 1 and the M part incremented by the contents of the I part. This made the coding of counting loops very efficient. Three additional Nest levels and one additional SJNS level were reserved to Director, the Operating System, allowing short-path interrupts to be handled without explicit register saving and restoring. As a result, the interrupt overhead was only three clock cycles.

===Instruction set===
Instructions were of one, two, or three syllables. Although the word &#x27;byte&#x27; had been coined by the designers of the IBM 7030 Stretch for a group of eight bits, it was not yet well known, and English Electric used the word &#x27;syllable&#x27; for what is now called a byte. Most arithmetic took place at the top of the Nest and used &quot;zero-address&quot;, one-syllable instructions, although address arithmetic and index updating were handled separately in the Q store. Q Store handling, and some memory reference instructions used two syllables. Memory reference instructions with a 16-bit address offset, most jump instructions, and 16-bit literal load instructions, all used 3 syllables.

Dense instruction coding, and intensive use of the register sets, meant that relatively few store accesses were needed for common scientific codes, such as scalar product and polynomial inner loops. This did much to offset the relatively slow core cycle time, giving the KDF9 about a third of the speed of its much more famous, but 8 times more expensive and much less commercially successful contemporary, the Manchester/Ferranti Atlas Computer.

===Multiprogramming (timesharing)===
The KDF9 was one of the earliest fully hardware-secured multiprogramming systems. Up to four programs could be run at once under the control of its elegantly simple operating system, the &quot;Timesharing Director&quot;, each being confined to its own core area by BA (Base Address) and NOL (Number of Locations) registers. Each program had its own sets of stack and Q store registers, which were activated when that program was dispatched, so that context switching was very efficient.

Each program could drive hardware I/O devices directly, but was limited by hardware checks to those that the Director had allocated to it. Any attempt to use an unallocated device caused an error interrupt. A similar interrupt resulted from overfilling (or over-emptying) the Nest or SJNS, or attempting to access storage at an address above that given in the NOL register. Somewhat different was the Lock-Out interrupt, which resulted from trying to access an area of store that was currently being used by an I/O device, so that there was hardware mutual exclusion of access to DMA buffers. When a program blocked on a Lock-Out, or by voluntarily waiting for an I/O transfer to terminate, it was interrupted and Director switched to the program of highest priority that was not itself blocked. When a Lock-Out cleared, or an awaited transfer terminated, and the responsible program was of higher priority than the program currently running, the I/O Control (IOC) unit interrupted to allow an immediate context switch. IOC also made provision to avoid priority inversion, in which a program of high priority waits for a device made busy by a program of lower priority, requesting a distinct interrupt in that case.

Later operating systems, including Eldon 2 at the University of Leeds, and COTAN, developed by UKAEA Culham Laboratories with the collaboration of Glasgow University, were fully interactive multi-access systems, with PDP-8 front ends to handle the terminals.

The Kidsgrove and Whetstone Algol 60 compilers were among the first of their class. The Kidsgrove compiler stressed optimization; the Whetstone compiler produced an interpretive object code aimed at debugging. It was by instrumenting the latter that Brian Wichmann obtained the statistics on program behaviour that led to the Whetstone benchmark for scientific computation, which inspired in turn the Dhrystone benchmark for non-numerical workloads.

==Reminiscence==
Machine code orders were written in a form of octal officially named &quot;syllabic octal&quot; (also known as &#x27;slob-octal&#x27; or &#x27;slob&#x27; notation,). It represented 8 bits with three octal digits but the first digit represented only the two most-significant bits, whilst the others the remaining two groups of three bits each. 

Within English Electric, its predecessor, DEUCE, had a well-used matrix scheme based on GIP (General Interpretive Programme). The unreliability of valve machines led to the inclusion of a sum-check mechanism to detect errors in matrix operations. The scheme used block floating-point using fixed-point arithmetic hardware, in which the sum-checks were precise. However, when the corresponding scheme was implemented on KDF9, it used floating point, a new concept that had only limited mathematical analysis. It quickly became clear that sum checks were no longer precise and a project was established in an attempt to provide a usable check. (In floating point (A + B) + C is not necessarily the same as A + (B + C) &quot;i.e.&quot; the + operation is not associative.) Before long, however, it was recognized that error rates with transistor machines was not an issue; they either worked correctly or did not work at all. Consequently, the idea of sum checks was abandoned. The initial matrix package proved a very useful system testing tool as it was able to generate lengthy performance checks well before more formal test packages which were subsequently developed.

There is a legend that the KDF9 was developed as project KD9 (Kidsgrove Development 9) and that the &#x27;F&#x27; in its designation was contributed by the then chairman after a long and tedious discussion on what to name the machine at launch—&quot;I don’t care if you call it the F—&quot;. The truth is more mundane: the name was chosen essentially at random by a marketing manager. (See also KDF8 for the parallel development and use of a commercially oriented computer.)

The EGDON operating system was so named because one was going to UKAEA Winfrith: in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s book &quot;The Return of the Native&quot; Winfrith Heath is called Egdon Heath. EGDON Fortran was called EGTRAN. Eldon was so named because Leeds University&#x27;s computer was located in a converted Eldon chapel.

<text>Mbongeni Ngema (10 May 1955 – 27 December 2023) was a South African playwright, lyricist, composer, director, choreographer, and theatre producer, best known for co-writing the 1981 play &quot;Woza Albert!&quot; and co-writing (with Hugh Masekela) the 1988 musical &quot;Sarafina!&quot;. He was known for plays that reflected the spirit of black South Africans under apartheid, and won much praise for his work, but was also the subject of several controversies. He died in a car accident on 27 December 2023.

==Early life and education==
Mbongeni Ngema was born on 10 May 1955 in Verulam, Natal (near Durban), the third of seven children of Gladys Hadebe and Zwelikhethabantu Ngema. Zwelikhethabantu was a policeman who had been born in the village of eNhlwathi, in kwaHlabisa, outside Mtubatuba, and was stationed at Verulam. This was a predominantly Indian area, but there were many Black residents too. After the 1950 Group Areas Act, Verulam was reclassified for Indians only, so black Africans were relocated, including the policeman&#x27;s children, to kwaHlabisa, to live with their grandfather. There Mbongeni and his siblings lived a rural life, getting up early to tend to the animals before school, which he attended until Standard Six.

He moved back to Verulam and then Durban to attend various high schools. In Umlazi, he attended Vukuzakhe High School, but dropped out in his final year and started playing music in local bands. He taught himself to play the guitar, inspired by his father.
==Career==
Ngema moved to Johannesburg, initially working in a fertilizer factory. There he played guitar backing for a workers&#x27; production, and was then asked to fill in for an actor who had fallen ill. He joined Gibson Kente&#x27;s theatre company as a singer and trainee actor, and was exposed to the work of Stanislavski, Peter Brook and Jerzy Grotowski. He acted in local productions in the 1970s. He later became a playwright, screenwriter, and librettist. 

He became well known in the 1980s after co-writing the comedy/drama &quot;Woza Albert!&quot; with fellow actor Percy Mtwa (1981; toured the U.S. 1984) and the multi-award-winning musical &quot;Sarafina!&quot; (premiered 1988). He wrote about and was known for his representation of the spirit of Black South Africans under the apartheid regime.

After founding his own theatre company, Committed Artists, Ngema trained young men who had no experience in acting. He wrote and in 1983 directed a production of the prison musical &quot;Asinamali&quot;, which, soon after its first performance in South Africa was raided by police and actors arrested. The story is based on a famous rent strike in a Durban township, and toured to New York City, premiering at the Roger Furman Theatre and being nominated for a Tony Award. The musical has been mounted around the world in various places, including Australia with an upcoming 2024 production in South Africa at the National Arts Festival. A film of the musical was released in 2017, co-written, directed by Ngema, in which he starred as Comrade Washington.

&quot;Sarafina!&quot; (1988), set in the Soweto uprising of 1976, was nominated for five Tony Awards, and was later also nominated for the Grammy Awards. The musical won 11 NAACP Image Awards, enjoyed a two-year run on Broadway, toured the US, Europe, Australia, and Japan, and was later adapted into a feature film starring Whoopi Goldberg, Leleti Khumalo, and Miriam Makeba. 

&quot;Township Fever&quot; (1990), about a major workers&#x27; strike, was very successful, and was produced in the U.S. after a production at the Market Theatre. In the same year, Ngema co-wrote (with Duma ka Ndlovu) and directed his first American work, &quot;Sheila&#x27;s Day&quot;, staged by African American theatre company Crossroads Theatre.

Ngema was one of the vocal arrangers for the Disney film &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), for which he earned a multi-platinum award for sales in excess of 6 million copies. Also in 1994, he co-wrote the song &quot;African Solution&quot; with Mfiliseni Magubane for the National Peace Committee, with all proceeds going to the committee to assist families affected by violence. The song was awarded gold and platinum discs.

&quot;Mama&quot; (1995) was a musical about Soweto gangsters. It was produced by The Playhouse Company and toured Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In the same year, Ngema presented &quot;The Best of Mbongeni Ngema&quot; at The Playhouse, and a CD and video of the performance was released.

In 1995, Ngema created &quot;Sarafina II&quot;, a musical addressing the AIDS epidemic in South Africa, which debuted in early 1996.

In 1997, Ngema was both composer and producer of his solo album &quot;Woza My Fohloza&quot;, which he showcased on a tour of South Africa. He wrote and composed &quot;Maria–Maria&quot;, and choreographed and directed a production which premiered at Wiesbaden in 1997 and then toured Germany and Austria before opening at The Playhouse.

Also in 1997, Ngema was appointed a visiting lecturer at the University of Zululand to teach his unique technique and subsequently produced the first CD released by the university&#x27;s music department.

In 1998, Ngema was inducted into the New York &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; in front of the Lucille Lortel Theatre in Manhattan, New York City, as one of the revered writers of the 21st century. In 2001 during the African Renaissance festival, his name was engraved on the entrance of the City Hall in Durban alongside those of Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Miriam Makeba, and other heroes of the liberation struggle.

The City of Durban commissioned Ngema to compose a song to celebrate the new millennium (2000). 

In 2003, he was appointed artistic director for the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

&quot;The House of Shaka&quot; (2005), a play inspired by the life of King Goodwill Zwelithini, was very well received by audiences in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.

A revival of &quot;Sarafina!&quot; was created as part of the &quot;10 Years of Democracy&quot; celebrations in 2004. After being approached by a Nigerian production company who had seen &quot;House of Shaka&quot;, the production was staged in Nigeria in December 2005, for a week in Lagos and then a week in Abuja, in its first tour of the African continent. It went on to play in London as well as playing at the Emperors Palace in Johannesburg from 1 June 2006.

In 2006, the South African government commissioned Ngema to write &quot;1906 Bhambada The Freedom Fighter&quot;, to celebrate the centenary of the Zulu Rebellion against the settler government in the colony of Natal, led by Bhambatha. It ran for two weeks in Pietermaritzburg.

&quot;Lion of the East&quot; was commissioned by Mpumalanga Province in 2009 to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Potato Strike which took place in Bethal in the former Eastern Transvaal, led by Gert Sibande.

In 2013, his play &quot;The Zulu &quot; received standing ovations at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown (Makhanda). It also played in Wiesbaden, Germany to excellent reviews, followed by a successful tour of Europe before returning to South Africa in 2000 to run at the Market Theatre, Johannesburg, and The Playhouse in Durban.

As a librettist, Ngema wrote the musical soundtrack for &quot;Sarafina – the movie&quot; (1992). He also composed several music albums, including &quot;Stimela SaseZola&quot;, which was at the time his biggest album in South Africa. He wrote and arranged numerous songs as well as arranging music for artists such as Michael Bolton, on the soundtrack for the 1989 film &quot;Sing&quot;. 
== Musical collaborations==
Ngema participated in a song called &quot;Take This Song&quot;, recorded with the reggae band Third World, co-writing the backing vocals.

In 2020 he released the album &quot;Freedom is Coming Tomorrow (Remix)&quot; with Emtee, Saudi, Gigi Lamayne, Tamarsha, Reason, Blaklez &amp; DJ Machaba, and Third World, and a single, &quot;Sophia&quot; in the same year.

In 1985 the album &quot;S&#x27;timela Sase Zola&quot;, with its title track of the same name, was one of his biggest hits in South Africa. The song was re-released on the 2002 album &quot;Jive Madlokovu!!!&quot; (2002), along with a music video featuring dancing by a large group of Zulu dancers.

In 2004, to celebrate 10 years of the new South Africa, he released &quot;Libuyile&quot; (&quot;Songs of Freedom&quot;).

Other albums include &quot;Township Fever&quot; (1991), &quot;Magic At 4am&quot; (1993), &quot;The Best Of Mbongeni Ngema&quot; (1995), &quot;Woza My-Fohloza&quot; (1997), and &quot;Sarafina!&quot; (2004).

Committed Artists launched as a record label in 2005, whose first two CD releases were Ngema&#x27;s &quot;My Baby&quot;, and &quot;Nikeziwe&quot;, a debut album for 23-year-old Jumaima Julius written by Ngema for her. He had heard her when she was working on a play at the South African State Theatre, and decided to mentor her.

==Personal life==
Ngema married Xoliswa Nduneni-Ngema in February 1982. After they divorced, Nduneni-Ngema published a memoir in which she accused him of abuse, which included allegations of rape. During the marriage, he had a long-running affair with actress Leleti Khumalo, starting when she was still a teenager. He remained married, with Nduneni-Ngema acting as his business partner during the making of the film of &quot;Sarafina&quot;, in which Khumalo starred. After the film&#x27;s release in October 1992, the couple divorced, and he married Khumalo.

Khumalo was 15 years younger than Ngema. They divorced in 2005 after she left him. She later called her marriage &quot;disgusting&quot;, saying that she was not allowed any freedom and had &quot;fourteen years of misery&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Ngema died in a head-on car collision on 27 December 2023, while returning from a funeral in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape; he was a passenger. Ngema was 68 at the time of his death.

Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa as well as the head of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, paid tribute to Ngema, saying that his &quot;masterfully creative narration of our liberation struggle honoured the humanity of oppressed South Africans&quot; and &quot;exposed the inhumanity&quot; of the apartheid regime. Opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters wrote that he was &quot;more than just an artist; he was a cultural icon, and a beacon of hope during some of our darkest times&quot;. Actress Sophie Ndaba posted a tribute to him on Instagram.

Works about Ngema and his works include &quot;Nothing Except Ourselves&quot; by Laura Jones (1994).

Ngema was buried on 5 January 2024.
==Controversies==
In 1996, the planned 12-month run of &quot;Sarafina II&quot; was cancelled due to corruption allegations, which implicated Ngema as well as the Minister of Health Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The play had been commissioned by the new post-apartheid government at a cost of (), which the Public Protector, South Africa&#x27;s anti-corruption watchdog, investigated. It found that the health department&#x27;s funding was an &quot;unauthorised expenditure&quot;, and its messaging about the HIV/AIDS epidemic was unsatisfactory. In 1997, Ngema was investigated for fraud concerning the spending of the R3m paid to him for the play.

In 2002 Ngema composed a song called &quot;AmaNdiya&quot;, which was critical of how the Indian people of KwaZulu Natal were treating its employees and paying them a pittance. This song was banned from public broadcast by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa, after the SA Human Rights Commission lodged a complaint. The judgment said that the song &quot;promoted hate in sweeping, emotive language against Indians as a race&quot;, and incited fear among Indians for their safety. Many people criticised the song and there was even a motion in parliament by ANC MP Alfred Maphalala to demand an apology. Nelson Mandela also called on Ngema to apologise for the lyrics.

In July 2019, Ngema was removed from his position as co-director of a production of &quot;Sarafina&quot; following allegations of sexual harassment and intimidation by a cast member.

<text>Sveriges fosterländska ungdomsförbund (Patriot Youth League of Sweden), an organization constituted on April 9, 1917, by representatives of the so-called National Democratic Youth Movement. The organization worked for preservation of monarchy and the official church.

One year after founding, the organization had 75 local units and around 6,000 members. An annual national meeting elected an eleven-member Central Committee which appointed a five-member Executive Committee. The organ of the organization was &quot;Nationaldemokraten&quot; (The National Democrat).

When Swedish speakers from Finland arrived to Sweden during the Finnish Civil War, the organization mobilized logistical support for them.

<doc id="1111427" wikidata="Q1350150" url="?curid=1111427" title="Peter Sarstedt">
<text>Peter Eardley Sarstedt (10 December 1941 – 8 January 2017) was a British singer-songwriter and instrumentalist. He was the brother of singers Eden Kane, a teenage pop idol and Clive Sarstedt, with both of whom he also recorded and performed as The Sarstedt Brothers. The Sarstedts had the distinction of being the only family from which three siblings separately attained chart success without any of them ever charting as a combined act.

Although his music was classified as pop, it generally encompassed ballads derived from traditional folk music rather than traditional rock and roll. He is best known for writing and performing the song &quot;Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?&quot;, which topped the UK Singles Chart in 1969. Set to a &quot;faux European waltz tune&quot; and described as &quot;a romantic novel in song&quot;, it won an Ivor Novello Award. The record remained Sarstedt&#x27;s biggest hit. He had one more hit single and one hit album but despite numerous releases never had chart success again.

He released the album &quot;England&#x27;s Lane&quot; in 1997, which continued the story of the fictional Marie-Claire in the song &quot;The Last of the Breed&quot;; a planned third installment titled &quot;Farewell Marie-Claire&quot; did not materialise. 

Sarstedt continued to tour mainly in 1960s revival-type shows, until his retirement in 2010 due to ill health.

==Early life==
Sarstedt was born as one of six in New Delhi in 1941 to English expatriates Albert James Sarstedt, an accountant and civil servant and his second wife Cora (nee Byrne) in what was then British India. His ancestors were long resident in India; his ancestor Christian Ludwig Wilhelm Sarstedt, was born in 1841 in Hanover, Germany and migrated to India where he died in 1893 Both of his parents had trained as classical musicians.

After Indian independence from Britain in 1947, Sarstedt&#x27;s parents managed a tea plantation in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, where Sarstedt attended Victoria Boys&#x27; School, a boarding school in Kurseong. He later moved to Calcutta; in 1954, Sarstedt&#x27;s father died and the family relocated to Britain, settling in south London just before the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll boom.

Sarstedt along with his two brothers Richard and Robin joined a skiffle group called &quot;The Fabulous Five&quot;, before establishing a group in 1960 called &quot;The Saints&quot;, with Richard as lead locallist and Peter playing bass guitar, whilst Richard was the first of the brothers to also establish a solo career in his own right also in 1960 and changing his name to Eden Kane, and becoming a teen idol having a hit record with &quot;Well I Ask You&quot; the following year in 1961. Peter would follow his older brother establishing his music career in the late 1960s, whist his younger brother Robin known as Clive Sarstedt would have a hit record with &quot;My Resistance is Low&quot; in 1976.

The Sarstedts had the distinction of being the first family where three siblings all attained separate chart success.

==Career==
===Hit recordings===
Sarstedt was best known for writing and performing his 1969 UK number one single, released on the United Artists label, &quot;Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?&quot;, a portrait of a poor-born girl, Marie-Claire, from Naples who becomes a member of the European jet set. The song topped the chart in 14 countries. and was awarded the 1970 Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. He later cited his first wife, Anita, as the inspiration for the song.

Lovely followed his earlier single &quot;I Am A Cathedral&quot; which didn&#x27;t attain chart success, and his debut self-titled vinyl LP album was released in 1969 and reached number eight on the British charts his follow-up single, &quot;Frozen Orange Juice&quot;, reached number 10 in the UK in 1969. However, subsequent releases failed to chart. Sarstedt&#x27;s recorded songs include &quot;Beirut&quot;, &quot;Take Off Your Clothes&quot;

Another selection from the album &quot;Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?&quot;, from which his single of the same title had been released, was an instrumental called &quot;Overture&quot;. Sarstedt composed it in collaboration with Ian Green and Ray Singer and it was later used as the theme music for Keep America Beautiful&#x27;s famous &quot;Crying Indian&quot; public service announcement, which starred Iron Eyes Cody.

===Touring===
In the 1980s and 1990s, Sarstedt frequently toured the southern UK as part of the &quot;Solid Silver &#x27;60s&quot; package tours, having returned to England after several years residing in Denmark. In the 1990s and 2000s, he continued to release new albums and tour. In 1997 he released the album &quot;England&#x27;s Lane&quot;, which featured the follow-up to &quot;Where Do You Go To&quot;, entitled &quot;The Last of the Breed&quot; and in 2006 an album of new material called &quot;On Song.&quot; He sang harmonies on &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice&quot; and &quot;The Last Thing on My Mind&quot; on Canadian singer Peter Thompson&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Taking a Dive (Heart First)&quot;.

===Popular culture===
New interest was sparked in his music after &quot;Where Do You Go To&quot; was used in the 2007 Wes Anderson films &quot;Hotel Chevalier&quot; and &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot;. In 2012 a compilation of songs called &quot;Highlights—the Demos&quot; was released.

===Later years===
Sarstedt&#x27;s final album, was a compilation released in 2013, was titled &quot;Restless Heart&quot;.

A third installment of &quot;Where Do You Go To&quot;, continuing the story of Marie-Claire, to be titled &quot;Farewell Marie-Claire&quot;, did not materialize.

<doc id="1111435" wikidata="Q4818002" url="?curid=1111435" title="Attack on Reginald Denny">
<text>Reginald Oliver Denny (born 1953) is a former construction truck driver who was pulled from his truck and severely beaten during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. His attackers, a group of black men who came to be known as the &quot;L.A. Four&quot;, targeted Denny because he was white. The attack was captured on video by a news helicopter and broadcast live on U.S. national television.

Four other black L.A. residents who had witnessed the attack on live television came to Denny&#x27;s aid, placing him back in his truck and driving him to the hospital. Denny suffered a fractured skull and impairment of his speech and his ability to walk, for which he underwent years of rehabilitative therapy. After unsuccessfully suing the City of Los Angeles, Denny moved to Arizona, where he worked as an independent boat mechanic and has mostly avoided media contact.

==Background==
On March3, 1991, an amateur video recording showed Rodney King, a black motorist, being badly beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers during an arrest. The outrage resulting from the acquittal of these police officers was the principal cause of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

Born in 1953 in Lansing, Michigan, Reginald Oliver Denny was a 39-year-old truck driver at the time of the attack. His parents moved to Sylmar, Los Angeles, when he was a child.

==Attack==
On April29, 1992, at 5:39p.m., Denny loaded his red dump truck with of sand to be delivered to a plant in Inglewood. On the way, he left the Harbor Freeway and took a familiar shortcut along Florence Avenue. He was listening to the radio, &quot;probably KKLA, a Christian channel,&quot; Denny said, &quot;or country station KZLA.&quot; At 6:46p.m., after he entered the intersection of Florence and Normandie Avenue, rioters threw rocks at his windows, and he heard people shouting for him to stop, forcing him to do so in the middle of the street.

Video footage taken from a helicopter by freelance journalists Bob Tur and Marika Gerrard showed Denny being pulled from his truck and beaten with fists, kicked, and struck with a cinder block before being rescued by four nearby residents. Timothy Goldman, a local resident who was filming on the ground at the corner of Florence and Normandie Avenues, captured a part of the scene. The attack has been described as a hate crime in which Denny, a white man, was targeted for his race in response to police brutality against King and the belief that the criminal justice system had failed to protect King&#x27;s civil rights.

Antoine Miller climbed up and opened the truck door, giving an unidentified man the chance to pull Denny out and throw him on the ground. Henry Watson stood on Denny&#x27;s neck to hold him down as a group of men surrounded him and Anthony Brown kicked him in the abdomen. As Watson walked away, two other unidentified men joined in the attack: one hurled a five-pound oxygenator stolen from Larry Tarvin&#x27;s truck at Denny&#x27;s head, and the other kicked him and hit him with a claw hammer. News footage showed Damian Williams throwing a cinder block at Denny&#x27;s head, then doing a football-style victory dance in the road and gesticulating gang signs. After the beating ended, some men threw beer bottles at the unconscious body and a man searched Denny&#x27;s back pockets, taking his wallet. Tur and Gerrard, observing the beating from their helicopter, reported that there were no police in the area.

Four black residents of South Central Los Angeles, Bobby Green Jr., Lei Yuille, Titus Murphy, and Terri Barnett, who had been watching the events on television, came to Denny&#x27;s aid. Green, also a truck driver, boarded Denny&#x27;s truck and drove him to the Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood.
Paramedics who attended to Denny said he suffered major trauma and came very close to dying. Soon after Green took him to the hospital, Denny suffered a seizure. His skull was fractured in 91 places and pushed into his brain. His left eye was so badly dislocated that it would have fallen into his sinus cavity had the surgeons not replaced the crushed bone with a piece of plastic. A crater remained in his forehead despite efforts to correct it.

==The &quot;L.A. Four&quot;==
The &quot;L.A. Four&quot; was a nickname given to the first four men charged with the attack on Denny: Damian Williams, Henry Watson, Antoine Miller, and Gary Williams.

Damian Monroe Williams (born March 17, 1973) was considered the most high-profile member of the four. Nicknamed &quot;Football&quot;, he was a high-school football star before dropping out in the 10th grade. Williams was identified on the video recording thanks to a large tattoo on his left arm related to the Crips street gang. He was mentioned in news reports and court records as a member of the 71 Hustlers, an affiliation of the Eight Trey Gangster Crips. Williams had several juvenile arrests but no convictions. His friends recalled him as being generous to children and devoted to caring for an older brother who had been beaten in a robbery. Williams faced the most serious charges of the four, including attempted murder, assault, and aggravated mayhem. His jury acquitted him on those charges and instead convicted him of only four misdemeanors and simple mayhem. He was given the maximum sentence of 10 years, but was paroled after serving four years. After his release, he was convicted in 2003 of second degree murder for his role in the 2000 killing of Grover Tinner, which took place at a house suspected of being used for selling narcotics. The victim&#x27;s sister disputed that Williams had shot at Tinner, and a coalition of community and religious leaders demanded his release, saying he was being targeted because of his involvement in the Denny case. He was ultimately convicted for participating in a crime resulting in a homicide and sentenced to 41 years in prison. he was incarcerated in Pelican Bay State Prison.

Henry Keith Watson was a 27-year-old former US Marine and ex-convict who had served time for armed robbery. After his release from prison, he married, had a daughter, and was working two jobs at the time of the attack.

Antoine Eugene Miller (May 5, 1972 – February 8, 2004) was a 19-year-old who lived with Damian Williams&#x27; family. Miller&#x27;s mother was not able to care for him, so as a child, Miller was sent to live with his grandmother. When he was 12, his grandmother killed his grandfather during an argument and was convicted of his murder, leaving Miller homeless. Miller had previously been arrested for misdemeanor drug charges, joyriding, and failing to appear in court. Miller was shot and killed at age 31 in a Hollywood nightclub in February 2004.

Gary Anthony Williams was a 33-year-old man described as a &quot;drifter&quot; and a &quot;hustler&quot; who begged at a local gas station. Although he claimed to work there, his arrest record listed him as unemployed.

==Trials==

On May 12, outgoing Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates started a search for three of Denny&#x27;s attackers, who were identified from the video of the beating. Gates himself arrested Damian Williams, while other officers arrested Henry Watson and Antoine Miller. Soon afterward, Gary Williams gave himself up to the police. The four arrested men were suspected to be part of the 83 Gangster Crips.

Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran was first asked to represent the men accused, but he refused. When offered to represent Denny, he obliged.

Judge John W. Ouderkirk granted Miller a separate trial on the grounds that the strong evidence against Watson and Damian Williams could harm his case; Miller was sentenced to 17 months in jail and 27 months on probation. Gary Williams was sentenced to three years in jail for attempting to rob Denny and assaulting another man.

Edi M.O. Faal was Damian Williams&#x27; defense attorney, and Earl C. Broadly was Henry Watson&#x27;s. On July 28, 1993, Watson&#x27;s and Williams&#x27; trial began. The two were charged with the assault of Denny as well as five other motorists and two firefighters who were driving past the intersection of Florence and Normandie shortly after the start of the Los Angeles riots on April 29. At the trial, Denny faced his attackers for the first time since they had assaulted him. On August 12, 1993, a jury of five whites, three blacks, three latinos, and one asian was chosen.

On August 19, Deputy District Attorney Lawrence Morrison delivered the opening statement and a week later, the videotape of the beating was shown. The doctors who treated Denny testified, describing his wounds and their efforts to repair them. Next to testify were witnesses of the beating and Denny&#x27;s rescuers. The prosecution rested on September 17, 1993. The defense began pleading on September 20, making a case for unpremeditated assault, with Faal challenging the video evidence and portraying Williams as a victim of poverty and racism. In the closing arguments, the defense attorneys claimed that Williams and Watson were being used as scapegoats for the L.A. riots. The prosecution counter-argued that the two had knowingly tried to kill Denny and were not victims.

Williams&#x27; lawyers successfully argued that he had not intended to kill Denny; he was found not guilty of attempted murder, assault, and aggravated mayhem, and convicted of four misdemeanors and simple mayhem, while Watson was convicted of a single misdemeanor assault charge. During a break in the trial, Denny approached Williams&#x27; mother, Georgiana, and hugged her. Watson was given credit for time served and was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation for the assaults of Denny and truck driver Larry Tarvin. Williams was denied bail and sentenced to a maximum of ten years for the assaults of Denny and four other people on December 7, 1993.

==Aftermath==
Denny sought to soothe racial tensions associated with his assault, reminding reporters that most of his rescuers were black, as were the doctors who treated him. He became friends with the four persons that saved him, and Green was hired by Denny&#x27;s employer Transit Mixed. Denny also sought to make peace with his attackers&#x27; families, saying that Watson had &quot;been through quite enough&quot; having been jailed for 17 months awaiting trial. Watson later apologized to Denny during an appearance on the &quot;Phil Donahue Show&quot;, where the pair shook hands.

As a result of the injuries he suffered during the attacks, Denny had to undergo years of rehabilitative therapy, and his speech and ability to walk were also damaged. During his recovery, he received over 27,000 get-well cards from supportive members of the community. After unsuccessfully suing the city of Los Angeles, Denny moved to Arizona to work as an independent boat motor mechanic. Denny has largely avoided the media and rarely spoken publicly about his ordeal.

In 1997, Damian Williams was released from prison early for good behavior, but in 2003, he was sentenced to 46 years to life in prison for the 2000 murder of drug dealer Grover Tinner. As of 2017, he is incarcerated at Centinela State Prison. Watson was re-arrested and sentenced to three years for a narcotics conviction and, after his release, owned and operated a limousine service in Los Angeles. On February 1, 2004, Antoine Miller was shot outside of a Hollywood nightclub during an altercation and died in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on February 8 at the age of 31. Gary Williams, Henry Watson, and Damian Williams gave interviews about the riots for the 2017 documentary &quot;Let It Fall: Los Angeles 1982–1992&quot;.

==Related litigation==
Video footage of Denny&#x27;s beating was taken from a helicopter by Bob Tur and Marika Gerrard, freelance reporters who ran the independent Los Angeles News Service (LANS). LANS sued several television stations that rebroadcast their footage for copyright infringement; at least one of these lawsuits was successful.

In July 2006, LANS sued YouTube in the United States District Court for the Central District of California for copyright infringement. LANS alleged in the lawsuit that, in the space of one week, a version of the video uploaded by a YouTube user was viewed over 1,000 times via the site. They argued this hurt their ability to license the video. YouTube requested summary judgment based on DMCA safe harbor, which was denied. LANS voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice, planning to join a class action against YouTube in New York. YouTube appealed both the dismissal and the summary judgment ruling. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal.

<doc id="1111455" wikidata="Q15579483" url="?curid=1111455" title="Carucate">
<text>The carucate or carrucate ( or ) was a medieval unit of land area approximating the land a plough team of eight oxen could till in a single annual season. It was known by different regional names and fell under different forms of tax assessment.

==England==
The carucate was named for the carruca heavy plough that began to appear in England in the late 9th century, which may have been introduced during the Viking invasions of England. It was also known as a ploughland or plough (, &quot;plough&#x27;s land&quot;) in the Danelaw and usually, but not always, excluded the land&#x27;s suitability for winter vegetables and desirability to remain fallow in crop rotation. The tax levied on each carucate came to be known as &quot;carucage&quot;. Though a carucate might nominally be regarded as an area of 120 acres (49 hectares), and can usefully be equated to certain definitions of the hide, its variation over time and depending on soil and fertility makes its actual figure wildly variable. The Danelaw carucates were subdivided into eighths: oxgangs or bovates based on the area a yoked pair of oxen could till in a year. In the rest of England, the land was reckoned in hides which were divided into four yardlands, later known as virgates.

==Scotland==
A ploughgate was the Scottish equivalent in the south and east of the country. Even more so than in England, the variable land quality in Scotland led to ploughgates of varying sizes, although the area was notionally understood as 100 Scots acres. Many sources say that four ploughgates made up a daugh, but in other places it would have appeared to have been the equivalent of one daugh exactly. As in the Danelaw, ploughgates were subdivided into oxgangs, again usually by eighths.

==Wales==
Cattle and oxen were a central part of the Laws of the ancient Celts, by the Welsh Middle Ages, oxen were an integral part of Welsh Law, and an important part of the legal valuations used in assessing land value, the wealth of personal holdings and determining compensations (such as the &quot;Galanas&quot;). Carucates are found throughout the Cyfraith Hywel (Law&#x27;s of Hywel Dda).

In 1086, the Domesday Book records a number of entries for commotes in Wales. These commotes, (that had come under Anglo-Norman possession, but were still part of Welsh law and customs) were assessed for military service and taxation. Whereas the English possessions obligations were given in hides, the Welsh obligations were rated in carucates. This was also true for Archenfield in Herefordshire which may indicate the area maintained the Welsh systems.

<text>Grawn () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Grand Traverse County in the U.S. state of Michigan. At the 2020 census, the community&#x27;s population was 816. The community is located within Blair Township on the border with Green Lake Township.

==History==
Grawn was founded in the 1870s as Blackwood after its first settler, James B. Blackwood. The Chicago and West Michigan Railway was built through Blackwood in 1890, and the village was renamed to Grawn Station, after Charles T. Grawn, the former superintendent of Central Michigan Normal School, and later the superintendent of Traverse City Area Public Schools. In the same year, the name was shortened to Grawn, and the village was given a post office with William H. Gibbs serving as the first postmaster. By 1905, potatoes had become the main crop of Grawn.

In December 1995, a fire broke out at Carl&#x27;s Tire Retreading Company in Grawn. The fire burned for 20 days and led to the evacuation of locals and of Blair Elementary School. In 2003, PFAS were found at the site and in local wells as a result of chemicals used to extinguish the fire.

The community of Grawn was listed as a newly organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning that it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

===Major highways===

<doc id="1111458" wikidata="Q2705820" url="?curid=1111458" title="Brown basilisk">
<text>The brown basilisk (Basiliscus vittatus), also commonly referred to as the striped basilisk or in some areas as the common basilisk, is a species of basilisk lizard in the family Corytophanidae. The species is native to Mexico, Central America and adjacent northwestern Colombia, and has been introduced into the U.S. state of Florida as an invasive species. The brown basilisk has large hind feet with narrow flaps of skin on the distal edge of each toe. The fact that it moves quickly across water gives it the appearance of &quot;walking on water&quot;.

==Description==
The male brown basilisk can reach in total length (including tail), but the female is somewhat smaller. It has a three-part dorsal crest on the head, along the back, and along the tail. Coloration is brown or olive brown with black crossbands. The crossbands are usually only on the flanks and on the dorsal crest. There is also a white stripe, which extends from the eyes to the rear legs. The male has a larger crest than the female. The brown basilisk weighs . It has long toes with sharp claws.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
The brown basilisk&#x27;s generic name &quot;Basiliscus&quot; is taken from the creature of Greek mythology made up of parts of a rooster, snake, and lion that could turn a man to stone by its gaze: the basilisk. This name derives from the Greek &quot;basilískos&quot; (βασιλίσκος) meaning &quot;little king&quot;. This generic name was given in Carl Linnaeus&#x27; 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

==Running on water==
Smaller brown basilisks can run about on the water without sinking. Young brown basilisks can usually run further than older ones. If the animal faces danger, it starts to run very fast on the surface of a river or a lake. The flaps on its hind feet are then opened and thus more surface area is provided for it to run on water.

==Behavior==
&quot;Basiliscus vittatus&quot; is in the same infraorder as the family Iguanidae. Like most reptiles, the brown basilisk is active during the day. Its outstanding camouflage allows it to remain motionless and very hard to detect. The maximum lifespan of the brown basilisk is probably around 7–8 years. In the wild, most die much sooner. 

==Reproduction==
Female brown basilisks lay about 2–18 eggs, five to eight times a year. Eggs hatch after about three months and the babies weigh around . It is hypothesized that they reproduce year-round, but males exhibit a peak in spermatogenic activity during the dry season and a peak in insemination and/or copulation at the beginning of the rainy season.

<doc id="1111473" wikidata="Q2383566" url="?curid=1111473" title="Well logging">
<text>Well logging, also known as borehole logging is the practice of making a detailed record (a &quot;well log&quot;) of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole. The log may be based either on visual inspection of samples brought to the surface (&quot;geological&quot; logs) or on physical measurements made by instruments lowered into the hole (&quot;geophysical&quot; logs). Some types of geophysical well logs can be done during any phase of a well&#x27;s history: drilling, completing, producing, or abandoning. Well logging is performed in boreholes drilled for the oil and gas, groundwater, mineral and geothermal exploration, as well as part of environmental and geotechnical studies.

==Wireline logging==
Different industries, as mining, oil and gas uses wireline logging to obtain a continuous record of a formation&#x27;s rock properties, also, groundwater consultants. Wireline logging can be defined as being &quot;The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services.&quot; Note that &quot;wireline logging&quot; and &quot;mud logging&quot; are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to &quot;TAH&quot; - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as hydrocarbon saturation and formation pressure, and to make further drilling and production decisions.

Wireline logging is performed by lowering a &#x27;logging tool&#x27; - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of a wireline into an oil well (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors. Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids. For this article, they are broadly broken down by the main property that they respond to.

The data itself is recorded either at surface (real-time mode), or in the hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a &quot;well log&quot; is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data. Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see Logging While Drilling), to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged.

Real-time data is recorded directly against measured cable depth. Memory data is recorded against time, and then depth data is simultaneously measured against time. The two data sets are then merged using the common time base to create an instrument response versus depth log. Memory recorded depth can also be corrected in exactly the same way as real-time corrections are made, so there should be no difference in the attainable TAH accuracy.

The measured cable depth can be derived from a number of different measurements, but is usually either recorded based on a calibrated wheel counter, or (more accurately) using magnetic marks which provide calibrated increments of cable length. The measurements made must then be corrected for elastic stretch and temperature.

There are many types of wireline logs and they can be categorized either by their function or by the technology that they use. &quot;Open hole logs&quot; are run before the oil or gas well is lined with pipe or cased. &quot;Cased hole logs&quot; are run after the well is lined with casing or production pipe.

Wireline logs can be divided into broad categories based on the physical properties measured.

===History===
Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger, who founded Schlumberger Limited in 1926, are considered the inventors of electric well logging. Conrad developed the Schlumberger array, which was a technique for prospecting for metal ore deposits, and the brothers adapted that surface technique to subsurface applications. On September 5, 1927, a crew working for Schlumberger lowered an electric sonde or tool down a well in Pechelbronn, Alsace, France creating the first well log. In modern terms, the first log was a resistivity log that could be described as 3.5-meter upside-down lateral log.

In 1931, Henri George Doll and G. Dechatre, working for Schlumberger, discovered that the galvanometer wiggled even when no current was being passed through the logging cables down in the well. This led to the discovery of the spontaneous potential (SP) which was as important as the ability to measure resistivity. The SP effect was produced naturally by the borehole mud at the boundaries of permeable beds. By simultaneously recording SP and resistivity, loggers could distinguish between permeable oil-bearing beds and impermeable nonproducing beds.

In 1940, Schlumberger invented the spontaneous potential dipmeter; this instrument allowed the calculation of the dip and direction of the dip of a layer. The basic dipmeter was later enhanced by the resistivity dipmeter (1947) and the continuous resistivity dipmeter (1952).

Oil-based mud (OBM) was first used in Rangely Field, Colorado, in 1948. Normal electric logs require a conductive or water-based mud, but OBMs are nonconductive. The solution to this problem was the induction log, developed in the late 1940s.

The introduction of the transistor and integrated circuits in the 1960s made electric logs vastly more reliable. Computerization allowed much faster log processing, and dramatically expanded log data-gathering capacity. The 1970s brought more logs and computers. These included combo type logs where resistivity logs and porosity logs were recorded in one pass in the borehole.

The two types of porosity logs (acoustic logs and nuclear logs) date originally from the 1940s. Sonic logs grew out of technology developed during World War II. Nuclear logging has supplemented acoustic logging, but acoustic or sonic logs are still run on some combination logging tools.

Nuclear logging was initially developed to measure the natural gamma radiation emitted by underground formations. However, the industry quickly moved to logs that actively bombard rocks with nuclear particles. The gamma ray log, measuring the natural radioactivity, was introduced by Well Surveys Inc. in 1939, and the WSI neutron log came in 1941. The gamma ray log is particularly useful as shale beds which often provide a relatively low permeability cap over hydrocarbon reservoirs usually display a higher level of gamma radiation. These logs were important because they can be used in cased wells (wells with production casing). WSI quickly became part of Lane-Wells. During World War II, the US Government gave a near wartime monopoly on open-hole logging to Schlumberger, and a monopoly on cased-hole logging to Lane-Wells. Nuclear logs continued to evolve after the war.

After the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance by Bloch and Purcell in 1946, the nuclear magnetic resonance log using the Earth&#x27;s field was developed in the early 1950s by Chevron and Schlumberger. Nicolaas Bloembergen filed the Schlumberger patent in 1966. The NMR log was a scientific success but an engineering failure. More recent engineering developments by NUMAR (a subsidiary of Halliburton) in the 1990s has resulted in continuous NMR logging technology which is now applied in the oil and gas, water and metal exploration industry.

Many modern oil and gas wells are drilled directionally. At first, loggers had to run their tools somehow attached to the drill pipe if the well was not vertical. Modern techniques now permit continuous information at the surface. This is known as logging while drilling (LWD) or measurement-while-drilling (MWD). MWD logs use mud pulse technology to transmit data from the tools on the bottom of the drillstring to the processors at the surface.

===Electrical logs===

====Resistivity log====

Resistivity logging measures the subsurface electrical resistivity, which is the ability to impede the flow of electric current. This helps to differentiate between formations filled with salty waters (good conductors of electricity) and those filled with hydrocarbons (poor conductors of electricity). Resistivity and porosity measurements are used to calculate water saturation. Resistivity is expressed in ohms.meter (Ω⋅m), and is frequently charted on a logarithm scale versus depth because of the large range of resistivity. The distance from the borehole penetrated by the current varies with the tool, from a few centimeters to one meter.

====Borehole imaging====
The term &quot;borehole imaging&quot; refers to those logging and data-processing methods that are used to produce centimeter-scale images of the borehole wall and the rocks that make it up. The context is, therefore, that of open hole, but some of the tools are closely related to their cased-hole equivalents. Borehole imaging has been one of the most rapidly advancing technologies in wireline well logging. The applications range from detailed reservoir description through reservoir performance to enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. Specific applications are fracture identification, analysis of small-scale sedimentological features, evaluation of net pay in thinly bedded formations, and the identification of breakouts (irregularities in the borehole wall that are aligned with the minimum horizontal stress and appear where stresses around the wellbore exceed the compressive strength of the rock).
The subject area can be classified into four parts:
# Optical imaging
# Acoustic imaging
# Electrical imaging
# Methods that draw on both acoustic and electrical imaging techniques using the same logging tool

===Porosity logs===
Porosity logs measure the fraction or percentage of pore volume in a volume of rock. Most porosity logs use either acoustic or nuclear technology. Acoustic logs measure characteristics of sound waves propagated through the well-bore environment. Nuclear logs utilize nuclear reactions that take place in the downhole logging instrument or in the formation. Nuclear logs include density logs and neutron logs, as well as gamma ray logs which are used for correlation.
 The basic principle behind the use of nuclear technology is that a neutron source placed near the formation whose porosity is being measured will result in neutrons being scattered by the hydrogen atoms, largely those present in the formation fluid. Since there is little difference in the neutrons scattered by hydrocarbons or water, the porosity measured gives a figure close to the true physical porosity whereas the figure obtained from electrical resistivity measurements is that due to the conductive formation fluid. The difference between neutron porosity and electrical porosity measurements therefore indicates the presence of hydrocarbons in the formation fluid.

====Density====

The density log measures the bulk density of a formation by bombarding it with a radioactive source and measuring the resulting gamma ray count after the effects of Compton Scattering and Photoelectric absorption. This bulk density can then be used to determine porosity.

====Neutron porosity====

The neutron porosity log works by bombarding a formation with high energy epithermal neutrons that lose energy through elastic scattering to near thermal levels before being absorbed by the nuclei of the formation atoms. Depending on the particular type of neutron logging tool, either the gamma ray of capture, scattered thermal neutrons or scattered, higher energy epithermal neutrons are detected. The neutron porosity log is predominantly sensitive to the quantity of hydrogen atoms in a particular formation, which generally corresponds to rock porosity.

Boron is known to cause anomalously low neutron tool count rates due to it having a high capture cross section for thermal neutron absorption. An increase in hydrogen concentration in clay minerals has a similar effect on the count rate.

====Sonic====

A sonic log provides a formation interval transit time, which is typically a function of lithology and rock texture but particularly porosity. The logging tool consists of at least one piezoelectric transmitter and two or more receivers. The time it takes for the sound wave to travel the fixed distance between two receivers is recorded as an &quot;interval transit time&quot;.

===Lithology logs===

====Gamma ray====

A log of the natural radioactivity of the formation along the borehole, measured in API units, particularly useful for distinguishing between sands and shales in a siliclastic environment. This is because sandstones are usually nonradioactive quartz, whereas shales are naturally radioactive due to potassium isotopes in clays, and adsorbed uranium and thorium.

In some rocks, and in particular in carbonate rocks, the contribution from uranium can be large and erratic, and can cause the carbonate to be mistaken for a shale. In this case, the carbonate gamma ray is a better indicator of shale content. The carbonate gamma ray log is a gamma ray log from which the uranium contribution has been subtracted.

====Self/spontaneous potential====

The Spontaneous Potential (SP) log measures the natural or spontaneous potential difference between the borehole and the surface, without any applied current. It was one of the first wireline logs to be developed, found when a single potential electrode was lowered into a well and a potential was measured relative to a fixed reference electrode at the surface.

The most useful component of this potential difference is the electrochemical potential because it can cause a significant deflection in the SP response opposite permeable beds. The magnitude of this deflection depends mainly on the salinity contrast between the drilling mud and the formation water, and the clay content of the permeable bed. Therefore, the SP log is commonly used to detect permeable beds and to estimate clay content and formation water salinity.
The SP log can be used to distinguish between impermeable shale and permeable shale and porous sands.

===Miscellaneous logs===

====Caliper====

A tool that measures the diameter of the borehole mechanically, using either 2 or 4 arms, or through high-frequency acoustic signals. Because most logs are dependent on borehole regularity to record accurately, the caliper log can indicate where logs are potentially compromised due to the borehole being either over-gauged (due to washout) or under-gauged (like mudcake buildup).

====Nuclear magnetic resonance====

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging uses the NMR response of a formation to directly determine its porosity and permeability, providing a continuous record along the length of the borehole.
The chief application of the NMR tool is to determine moveable fluid volume (BVM) of a rock. This is the pore space excluding clay bound water (CBW) and irreducible water (BVI). Neither of these are moveable in the NMR sense, so these volumes are not easily observed on older logs. On modern tools, both CBW and BVI can often be seen in the signal response after transforming the relaxation curve to the porosity domain. Note that some of the moveable fluids (BVM) in the NMR sense are not actually moveable in the oilfield sense of the word. Residual oil and gas, heavy oil, and bitumen may appear moveable to the NMR precession measurement, but these will not necessarily flow into a well bore.

====Spectral acoustic logging====
Spectral acoustic logging is an acoustic measurement technique used in oil and gas wells for well integrity analysis, identification of production and injection intervals and hydrodynamic characterisation of the reservoir. Spectral acoustic logging records acoustic energy generated by fluid or gas flow through the reservoir or leaks in downhole well components.

Acoustic logging tools have been used in the petroleum industry for several decades. As far back as 1955, an acoustic detector was proposed for use in well integrity analysis to identify casing holes.
Over many years, downhole acoustic logging tools proved effective in inflow and injectivity profiling of operating wells, leak detection, location of cross-flows behind casing, and even in determining reservoir fluid compositions. Robinson (1974) described how noise logging can be used to determine effective reservoir thickness.

====Corrosion well logging====
Throughout the life of the wells, integrity controles of the steel and cemented column (casing and tubing) are performed using calipers and thickness gauges. These advanced technical methods use non destructive technologies as ultrasonic, electromagnetic and magnetic transducers.

==Logging while drilling==

In the 1970s, a new approach to wireline logging was introduced in the form of logging while drilling (LWD). This technique provides similar well information to conventional wireline logging but instead of sensors being lowered into the well at the end of wireline cable, the sensors are integrated into the drill string and the measurements are made in real-time, whilst the well is being drilled. This allows drilling engineers and geologists to quickly obtain information such as porosity, resistivity, hole direction and weight-on-bit and they can use this information to make immediate decisions about the future of the well and the direction of drilling.
In LWD, measured data is transmitted to the surface in real time via pressure pulses in the well&#x27;s mud fluid column. This mud telemetry method provides a bandwidth of less than 10 bits per second, although, as drilling through rock is a fairly slow process, data compression techniques mean that this is an ample bandwidth for real-time delivery of information. A higher sample rate of data is recorded into memory and retrieved when the drillstring is withdrawn at bit changes. High-definition downhole and subsurface information is available through networked or wired drillpipe that deliver memory quality data in real time.

===Memory log===
This method of data acquisition involves recording the sensor data into a down hole memory, rather than transmitting &quot;Real Time&quot; to surface. There are some advantages and disadvantages to this memory option.
*The tools can be conveyed into wells where the trajectory is deviated or extended beyond the reach of conventional Electric Wireline cables. This can involve a combination of weight to strength ratio of the electric cable over this extended reach. In such cases the memory tools can be conveyed on Pipe or Coil Tubing.
*The type of sensors are limited in comparison to those used on Electric Line, and tend to be focussed on the cased hole, production stage of the well. Although there are now developed some memory &quot;Open Hole&quot; compact formation evaluation tool combinations. These tools can be deployed and carried downhole concealed internally in drill pipe to protect them from damage while running in the hole, and then &quot;Pumped&quot; out the end at depth to initiate logging. Other basic open hole formation evaluation memory tools are available for use in &quot;Commodity&quot; markets on slickline to reduce costs and operating time.
*In cased hole operation there is normally a &quot;Slick Line&quot; intervention unit. This uses a solid mechanical wire (0.072 - 0.125 inches in OD), to manipulate or otherwise carry out operations in the well bore completion system. Memory operations are often carried out on this Slickline conveyance in preference to mobilizing a full service Electric Wireline unit.
*Since the results are not known until returned to surface, any realtime well dynamic changes cannot be monitored real time. This limits the ability to modify or change the well down hole production conditions accurately during the memory logging by changing the surface production rates. Something that is often done in Electric Line operations.
*Failure during recording is not known until the memory tools are retrieved. This loss of data can be a major issue on large offshore (expensive) locations. On land locations (e.g. South Texas, US) where there is what is called a &quot;Commodity&quot; Oil service sector, where logging often is without the rig infrastructure. this is less problematic, and logs are often run again without issue.

==Coring==
Coring is the process of obtaining an actual sample of a rock formation from the borehole. There are two main types of coring: &#x27;full coring&#x27;, in which a sample of rock is obtained using a specialised drill-bit as the borehole is first penetrating the formation and &#x27;sidewall coring&#x27;, in which multiple samples are obtained from the side of the borehole after it has penetrated through a formation. The main advantage of sidewall coring over full coring are that it is cheaper (drilling doesn&#x27;t have to be stopped) and multiple samples can be easily acquired, with the main disadvantages being that there can be uncertainty in the depth at which the sample was acquired and the tool can fail to acquire the sample.

==Mudlogging==

&quot;Mud logs&quot; are well logs prepared by describing rock or soil cuttings brought to the surface by mud circulating in the borehole. In the oil industry they are usually prepared by a mud logging company contracted by the operating company. One parameter a typical mud log displays is the formation gas (gas units or ppm). &quot;The gas recorder usually is scaled in terms of arbitrary gas units, which are defined differently by the various gas-detector manufactures. In practice, significance is placed only on relative changes in the gas concentrations detected.&quot; The current oil industry standard mud log normally includes real-time drilling parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), lithology, gas hydrocarbons, flow line temperature (temperature of the drilling fluid) and chlorides but may also include mud weight, estimated pore pressure and corrected d-exponent (corrected drilling exponent) for a pressure pack log. Other information that is normally notated on a mud log include directional data (deviation surveys), weight on bit, rotary speed, pump pressure, pump rate, viscosity, drill bit info, casing shoe depths, formation tops, mud pump info, to name just a few.

==Information use==

In the oil industry, the well and mud logs are usually transferred in &#x27;real time&#x27; to the operating company, which uses these logs to make operational decisions about the well, to correlate formation depths with surrounding wells, and to make interpretations about the quantity and quality of hydrocarbons present. Specialists involved in well log interpretation are called log analysts.

<text>A carport is a covered structure used to offer limited protection to vehicles, primarily cars, from rain and snow. The structure can either be free standing or attached to a wall. Unlike most structures, a carport does not have four walls, and usually has one or two. Carports offer less protection than garages but allow for more ventilation. In particular, a carport prevents frost on the windshield.
A &quot;mobile&quot; and/or &quot;enclosed&quot; carport has the same purpose as a standard carport. However, it may be removed/relocated and is typically framed with tubular steel and may have canvas or vinyl type covering which encloses the complete frame, including walls. It may have an accessible front entry or open entryway not typically attached to any structure or fastened in place by permanent means put held in place by stakes. It is differentiated from a tent by its main purpose: to house vehicles and/or motorized equipment (a tent is to shelter people).

==History==
The term &quot;carport&quot; comes from the French term &quot;porte-cochère&quot;, referring to a covered portal. Renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright coined the term when he used a carport in the first of his &quot;Usonian&quot; home designs: the house of Herbert Jacobs, built in 1936 in Madison, Wisconsin.

Quoting from the Carport Integrity Policy for the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office:

As early as 1909, carports were used by the Prairie School architect Walter Burley Griffin in his design for the Sloane House in Elmhurst, Illinois (Gebhard, 1991: 110). By 1913, carports were also being employed by other Prairie School architects such as the Minneapolis firm of Purcell, Feick &amp; Elmslie in their design for a residence at Lockwood Lake, Wisconsin. In this instance, the carport was termed an &quot;Auto Space&quot; (Gebhard, 1991: 110). The late architectural historian David Gebhard suggested that the term &quot;carport&quot; originated from the feature&#x27;s use in 1930s Streamline Moderne residences (Gebhard, 1991: 107). This term, which entered popular jargon in 1939, stemmed from the visual connection between these streamlined residences and nautical imagery. In the 1930s through the 1950s, carports were also being used by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Usonian Houses, an idea that he may have gotten from Griffin, a former associate.

The W. B. Sloane House in Elmhurst, Illinois, in 1910, is credited as being the first known home designed with a carport.

In describing the carport to Mr. Jacob, architect Wright said, &quot;A car is not a horse, and it doesn&#x27;t need a barn.&quot; He then added, &quot;Cars are built well enough now so that they do not require elaborate shelter.&quot; Cars prior to this time were not completely water tight; the era of robotic-assembly, advanced materials, and perfect closure lines was still 50 years in the future.

The carport was therefore a cheap and effective device for protecting a car. Mr. Jacobs added: &quot;Our cheap second-hand car had stood out all winter at the curb, often in weather far below zero (Fahrenheit). A carport was a downright luxury for it.&quot;

==Solar canopy==
A solar canopy carport is a structure that elevates an array of photovoltaic panels above ground level so that the area under the panels can be used for other purposes. Many solar canopies are built over parking lots, where in addition to generating renewable power, they also protect the cars from sun, rain and snow. When the lot is not needed for parking, the covered area can be used for other purposes.

<text>Basarab II was the Voivode of the principality of Wallachia (1442–1443), and the son of the former Wallachian ruler Dan II of Wallachia. Basarab II ruled during a turbulent time in Wallachia, now part of present-day Romania, with his rule falling between that of the father and son rule of Vlad Dracul and Mircea II. His reign was extremely short, as during that period only the strongest could retain their hold on the region for any great length of time. He took over as ruler in August 1442, holding on to it only until the Autumn of 1443, when Vlad Dracul forced him out.

During that time, the power of the Ottoman Empire became stronger with each year, making them a constant threat to independent Wallachia. Anyone who ruled Wallachia had not only the Ottomans to deal with, but the internal conflicts of their own people. Politics had to be juggled between maintaining good relations with the Hungarian Kingdom, who were often needed as powerful allies against the invasions of the Ottomans, as well as maintaining at least semi-friendly relations with the Ottomans themselves.

In 1442, Hungarian hero John Hunyadi defeated the Ottomans in battle, and placed Basarab II in power, forcing Vlad Dracul and his family to flee. However, the following year Vlad Dracul regained the throne with Ottoman support, based on a new treaty that had the conditions that he make the usual annual tribute, in addition to sending Wallachian boys each year to be trained for service in the Ottoman army. To further show his loyalty, he sent to the Sultan two of his sons, Vlad Țepeș and Radu cel Frumos, as hostages. The elder of the two boys would go on to become the inspiration for the novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, by Bram Stoker. Basarab II was not killed by Vlad Dracul when the latter restored his rule, however he would be buried alive during the second reign of Vlad Tepes.

<text>Ishaq al-Turk was an Iranian rebel who started a rebellion in Khorasan against the Abbasid Caliphate, after the murder of Abu Muslim. Ishaq was a Zoroastrian, or a Khurramite.

After Abu Muslim&#x27;s murder at the orders of al-Mansur, Ishaq fled to Transoxania, and declared a revolt on al-Mansur. He claimed that Abu Muslim was a prophet who was sent to reform Zoroastrianism, thus starting one of many movements claiming prophethood or divinity for Abu Muslim. He also claimed descent from Yahya ibn Zayd. The Abbasid ruler of Khorasan had him captured and executed. His group continued to be known as al-Muslimiyya &quot;(followers of Abu Muslim Khorasani),&quot; and constitute the fundamental ideology of the sect well known as Bābak’iyyāh in the future.

He received the sobriquet &quot;Turk&quot; because of his frequent visits among the Turks of Transoxania.

<text>Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive lycopodian vascular plants belonging the order Lepidodendrales. It is well preserved and common in the fossil record. Like other Lepidodendrales, species of &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; grew as large-tree-like plants in wetland coal forest environments. They sometimes reached heights of , and the trunks were often over in diameter. They are often known as &quot;scale trees&quot;, due to their bark having been covered in diamond shaped leaf-bases, from which leaves grew during earlier stages of growth. However, they are correctly defined as arborescent lycophytes. They thrived during the Carboniferous Period (358.9 to 298.9 million years ago), and persisted until the end of the Permian around 252 million years ago. Sometimes erroneously called &quot;giant club mosses&quot;, the genus was actually more closely related to modern quillworts than to modern club mosses. In the form classification system used in paleobotany, &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; is both used for the whole plant as well as specifically the stems and leaves.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;&quot;, scale, and &quot;dendron&quot;, tree.

== Description and biology ==

=== Overview ===
&quot;Lepidodendron&quot; species were comparable in size to modern trees. The plants had tapering trunks as wide as at their base that rose to about and even , arising from an underground system of horizontally spreading branches that were covered with many rootlets. Though the height of the lycopsids make the plants similar to modern trees, the constant dichotomy of branches created a habit that contrasts with that of modern trees. At the ends of branches were oval-shaped strobili called &quot;Lepidostrobus&quot; that had a similar shape to modern cones of a spruce or fir.

=== Stem ===

The stem of the lycopsids had a unifacial vascular cambium, contrasting with the bifacial vascular cambium of modern trees. Though the bifacial cambium of modern trees produces both secondary phloem and xylem, the unifacial cambium of &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; lycopsid produced only secondary xylem. As the lycopods aged, the wood produced by the unifacial cambium decreased towards the top of the plant such that terminal twigs resembled young &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; stems. Compared to modern trees, the stems and branches of the lycopsids contained little wood with the majority of mature stems consisting of a massive cortical meristem. The nearly-uniform growth of this cortical tissue indicates no difference in growth during changing seasons, and the absence of dormant buds further indicates the lack of seasonality in &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; species. The outermost cortex of oldest stems developed into the bark-like lycopodiopsid periderm. The bark of the lycopsid was somewhat similar to that of &quot;Picea&quot; species, as leaf scars formed peg-like projections that stretched and tore as the bark stretched. To resist the bending force of wind, &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; depended on their outer bark rather than their vascular tissues, as compared to modern trees that rely mostly on their central mass of wood.

=== Leaves ===

The leaves of the lycopsid were needle-like and were densely spiraled about young shoots, each possessing only a single vein. The leaves were similar to those of a fir in some species and similar to those of &quot;Pinus roxburghii&quot; in others, though in general the leaves of &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; species are indistinguishable from those of &quot;Sigillaria&quot; species. The decurrent leaves formed a cylindrical shell around branches. The leaves were only present on thin and young branches, indicating that, though the lycopsid were evergreen, they did not retain their needles for as long as modern conifers. 
The leaf-cushions were fusiform and elongated, growing at most to a length of and a width of . The middle of leaf-cushions were smooth, where leaf scars were created when an abscission layer cut a leaf from its base. Each leaf scar was composed of a central circular or triangular scar and two lateral scars that were smaller and oval-shaped. This central scar marks where the main vascular bundle of the leaf connected to the vascular system of the stem. This xylem bundle was composed only of primary trachea. The two outer scars mark the forked branches of a strand of vascular tissue that passed from the cortex of the stem into the leaf. This forked strand is sometimes referred to as the &quot;parichnos&quot;. Surrounding this strand were parenchyma cells and occasionally thick-walled elements. Surrounding both conducting tissues was a broad sheath of transfusion tracheids. Below the leaf scar the leaf-cushion tapered to a basal position. In this tapering area, circular impressions with fine pits were present. These impressions were continuous with the parichnos scars near the top of the tapering portion. This is because the impressions are formed by aerenchyma tissue that developed in closely with the parichnos. Above the leaf scar was a deep triangular impression known as the &quot;ligular pit&quot; for its similarities to the ligule of &quot;Isoetes&quot;. In some leaf-cushions a second depression was present above the ligular pit. Though its purpose is unclear, it has been suggested that the depression may mark the position of a sporangium. As the branch of a &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; lycopsid grew the leaf-cushion only grew to a certain extent, past which the leaf-cushion stretched. This stretching widened the groove that separated the leaf-cushions, creating a broad, flat channel.

=== Underground Structures ===
The underground structures of &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; and similar lycopsid species known from the fossil record including &quot;Sigillaria&quot; are assigned to the form taxon, &quot;Stigmaria&quot;. The rootlets were dichotomously branched from the rhizomes similar to &quot;Isoetes&quot;. These rhizomorphic axes were shoot-like, and dichotomous branching of the rootlets structured the stigmarian systems. Rootlet scars can be seen from &quot;Stigmaria&quot; fossils where the root hairs used to be attached. Hyphae are occasionally present in the tissues of &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; lycopsids, indicating the presence of mycorrhizal associations.

=== Decay ===

Different fossil genera have been described to name the various levels of decay in &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; bark fossils. The name &quot;Bergeria&quot; describes stems that have lost their epidermises, &quot;Aspidiariu&quot; is used when cushions have been removed by deep decay, and &quot;Knorria&quot; is used when the leaf cushions and the majority of cortical tissues has decayed, with a shallow &quot;fluted&quot; surface remaining. However, it has been suggested that these are more likely growth forms than preserved bark types, as entire fossilized trunks have been discovered with dissimilar forms; if decay is assumed to be constant throughout the trunk, then different forms indicate growth rather than levels of decay. It is likely that the trunk of &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; lycopsids were subject to the growth forms &quot;Knorria&quot;, &quot;Aspidiaria&quot;, and &quot;Bergeria&quot; progressing up the trunk, respectively.

==Growth and reproduction==

During the early stages of growth, &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; grew as single, unbranched trunk, with leaves growing out of the scale leaf bases (cushions). Towards the end of the lycopod growth, the leaves on the lower part of the trunk were shed, and in &quot;Lepidodendron&quot;, the upper part of the trunk dichotomously branched into a crown. The rate of growth of arborescent lycophytes is disputed, some authors contended that they had a rapid life cycle, growing to their maximum size and dying in only 10 to 15 years, while other authors argue that these growth rates were overestimated. Rather than reproduce with seeds, &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; lycopsids reproduced with spores. The spores were stored in sporangia situated on fertile stems that grew on or near the main trunk. The fertile stems grew together in cone-like structures that clustered at the tips of branches.

==Distribution==
The lack of growth rings and dormant buds indicates no seasonal growth patterns, and modern plants with similar characteristics tend to grow in tropical conditions. However, &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; species were distributed throughout subtropical regions. The lycopsid inhabited an extensive area compared to tropical flora of the same time period, with lycopods growing as far north as Spitsbergen and as far south as South America, in a latitudinal range of 120°.

== Extinction ==
In Euramerica, &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; became extinct at the end of the Carboniferous, as part of a broader pattern of ecological change, including the increasing dominance of seed plants in lowland wetland forests, and increasingly arid-adapted vegetation across western Pangea. However, in the Cathaysia region comprising what is now China, wet tropical environmental conditions continued to prevail, with &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; (in its broad sense) only becoming extinct around the end of the Permian, around 252 million years ago, as a result of the extreme environmental disturbance caused by the Permian-Triassic extinction event.

<doc id="1111507" wikidata="Q670698" url="?curid=1111507" title="Vladislav II of Wallachia">
<text>Vladislav II (died 20 August 1456) was a voivode of the principality of Wallachia, from 1447 to 1448, and again from 1448 to 1456. The way Vladislav II came to the throne is debatable. The most accepted view is that Vladislav assassinated Vlad II Dracul, ruler of Wallachia, and was subsequently placed on the throne by John Hunyadi, on the other, Vladislav II was helped by the Ottomans to replace Dan III which was assigned by the Hungarians.

==Conflict with John Hunyadi==
It is not known if Vladislav II had been invited to take part in the Battle of Kosovo (1448) or not. It is certain, however, that he did not send any troops in aid and as a result, John Hunyadi took back the Transylvanian possessions of Făgăraș and Amlaș on 23 April 1452. Vladislav retaliated by embargoing all Wallachian trade to Brașov County, then part of Hunyadi&#x27;s Transylvania. However, on 15 November 1455, after Hunyadi informed the people of Brașov that the embargo would be lifted, Vladislav seized back Transylvanian possessions, and attacked the Făgăraș fortress and in the process burns a few Saxon villages. In response, Hunyadi gives Vlad III; a son of the rival Drăculești house of Basarab (the future Vlad the Impaler) military support and, with the help of the Saxons whose villages were burned down, disposed Vladislav II.

==Death==
On July 22, 1456, Vlad II Dracul&#x27;s son Vlad III Dracula led a small army of mercenaries into Wallachia, when they were intercepted by Vladislav and his men near Târgșor. The commanders agreed to settle the dispute in single combat, so Vladislav and Dracula engaged in hand-to-hand combat in front of their hosts until Vlad Dracula struck a killing blow to Wallachia&#x27;s Voivode.

Vladislav was not buried at the Snagov Monastery, which he founded; instead, he was buried at the Dealu Monastery. His gravestone is marked &quot;August 22, 1456&quot;, however, that was the date of the engraving and not the date of his death. By August 22, Vlad III had already replaced Vladislav on the throne of Wallachia.

==Legacy==

Vladislav founded the Snagov Monastery in 1453, where a wooden sculpted door has been preserved to this day, and is exhibited at the Religious Art Museum of Bucharest. At Mount Athos in 1450, Vladislav gave Koutloumousiou Monastery a charter and gave a gift of 10,000 Akçet to St. Elijah Skit.

<doc id="1111509" wikidata="Q48834201" url="?curid=1111509" title="Walton, Michigan">
<text>Walton, often referred to as Walton Junction, is an unincorporated community in the northern Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Fife Lake Township, Grand Traverse County, and lies immediately north of the Wexford County line.

== History ==
The railroad junction at Walton was established in 1872 with the completion of an extension of the Grand Rapids &amp; Indiana Railroad north from Clam Lake (now Cadillac). The extension include a wye junction, with one branch extending northeast to Fife Lake (eventually to Petoskey), and the other extending northwest to Traverse City. While the settlement was originally called Walton Junction, a post office by the name of Walton opened on February 14, 1873. It is unclear when this post office closed. Early on, the town gained a reputation due to its lack of law enforcement and for being a rowdy and dangerous locale.

The community grew as northerly rail traffic to Traverse City and Petoskey increased throughout the 1880s and 1890s. In 1890, the local publisher, DeWitt Clinton Leach, built a dam on a creek southwest of Walton, and established a cranberry bog. The bog was abandoned by the early 1920s.

In 1909, an extension of the Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad (M&amp;NE) opened through the community. This line, which eventually connected Mesick to Grayling, was obliterated in 1925.

In 1940, US Highway 131, which had originally run through the community, was shifted onto a newly constructed alignment east of town. Today, all that remains of Walton are a handful of residences and open plats. The original railroad junction is still used and operated by the Great Lakes Central Railroad.

== Geography ==
Walton is located in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The community lies immediately north of the Grand Traverse–Wexford county line. The community is roughly equidistant between Cadillac and Traverse City, being about north of Cadillac, and about southeast of Traverse City.

<text>Fatima Meer (12 August 1928 – 12 March 2010) was a South African writer, academic, screenwriter, and prominent anti-apartheid activist.

== Early life ==

Fatima Meer was born in the Grey Streets of Durban, South Africa, into a middle-class family of nine, where her father M.I. Meer, a newspaper editor of TIV (The Indian View), instilled in her a consciousness of the racial discrimination that existed in the country. Her mother was Rachel Farrell, the second wife of Moosa Ismail Meer. Her mother was orphaned and of Jewish and Portuguese descent. She converted to Islam and changed her name to Amina. When she was 16 years old in 1944, she helped raise £1 000 for famine relief in Bengal, India. She completed her schooling at the Durban Indian Girls High School. When she was still a student she mobilized students to found the Student Passive Resistance Committee to gather funds for the Indian community&#x27;s passive resistance campaign from 1946 to 1948. The committee led her to meet Yusuf Dadoo, Monty Naicker, and Kesaveloo Goonam. She subsequently attended the University of the Witwatersrand for one year where she was a member of a Trotskyism group that was affiliated to Non-European Unity Movement (NEUM). She went to the University of Natal, where she completed a Bachelor&#x27;s degree and Master&#x27;s degree in Sociology.

== Political activist ==
Meer and Kesaveloo Goonam became the first women to be elected as executive of the Natal Indian Congress (NIC) in 1950. She helped to establish the Durban and District Women&#x27;s League on 4 October 1952 as a group of 70 women. This organisation was started in order to build alliances between Africans and Indians as a result of the race riots between the two groups in 1949. Bertha Mkhize became the chairperson and Meer became the secretary of the league. The league undertook work such as organizing child care and distributing milk at Cato Manor. The League also gathered funds for victims of a tornado at Springs where Africans became homeless, and successfully collected £4000 for the Sea Cow Lake flood victims.

After the National Party gained power in 1948 and started implementing their policy of anti-apartheid, Meer&#x27;s activism increased and as a result of her activism, she was first &quot;banned&quot; in 1952 for three years. She was one of the founding members of the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW), established on 17 April 1954 in the Trades Hall on Rissik Street, in central Johannesburg, which spearheaded the historical women&#x27;s march at the Union Buildings, Pretoria, on 9 August 1956. She was one of the leaders of the Women&#x27;s March in 1956. At the same year, she organized a committee to gather funds for bail and support the families of Natal political leaders who were in the treason trial.

In the 1960s, Meer organised night vigils to protest against the mass detention of anti-apartheid activists without trial outside Durban prison. She was also one of the organisers of a week-long vigil at the Gandhi Settlement in Phoenix. The leader of the vigil was Sushila Gandhi. During the 1970s, Meer started to embrace Black Consciousness Ideology with South African Student Organisation (SASO) led by Steve Biko.

In 1975, Meer co-founded the Black Women&#x27;s Federation (BWF) with Winnie Mandela. Meer became the first president of the organisation. A year later, she was banned again for a period of five years. The banning order came after she attended a meeting of the Black Studies Programme where she was a key speaker with a speech entitled &quot;Twenty-Five Years of Apartheid Rule&quot;. In June 1976, after Soweto Uprisings, 11 women from BWF were arrested and detained under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act. They were placed in solitary confinement at Fort Prison on Johannesburg. She narrowly survived an assassination attempt shortly after her release from detention in 1976 when she was shot at her family home in Durban, but not harmed. Her son, Rashid, went into exile in the same year. She was attacked again and blamed the second attack on the Black Consciousness Movement and Inkatha Freedom Party.

During the 1980s, Meer founded Co-ordinating Committee of Black (Indian, Coloured, African) Ratepayers Organisations to oppose the injustices which were happening to the black townships caused by Durban municipality. She declined the offer of a seat in parliament in 1994, because of her preference for non-governmental work. In May 1999, Meer founded the Concerned Citizens&#x27; Group (CCG) to persuade Indian people not to vote for white parties in the next election.

She was a strong supporter of the Iranian Revolution and boycotted Salman Rushdie&#x27;s trip to South Africa in 1998, claiming that he was a blasphemer. She was involved in protests against the oppression and assault of the Palestinian people and the US-led invasion of Afghanistan. She founded Jubilee 2000 to campaign for the cancellation of Third World debt.

== Charity work ==
She published her book entitled &quot;Portrait of Indian South Africans&quot; in 1969 and donated all revenue from the sale of the book to the Gandhi Settlement for the needs to build Gandhi Museum and Clinic. She helped an operation to rescue 10 000 Indian flood victims at Tin Town which was located on the banks of the Umgeni River. Meer built temporary housing in a tent and organized relief food and clothing. Later, she successfully negotiated permanent settlement for them in Phoenix. Meer also founded and became a leader of Natal Education Trust which gather money from the Indian community to build schools in Umlazi, Port Shepstone and Inanda.

She founded Tembalishe Tutorial College at Gandhi&#x27;s Phoenix home to taught blacks in secretarial skills in 1979. Crafts Centre also established at the Settlement to taught screen printing, sewing, embroidery and knitting for unemployed, Both the college and the crafts Center were closed in 1982 following after Fatima detainment for breaching her banning order caused of supervising the work outside of Durban boundary. During the 1980s, she organised scholarships for ten students to go to United States and assisted the &quot;SAVE OUR HOMES COMMITTEE&quot;  which was founded by the Coloured community of Sparks Estate to seek justice for who were threatened by the Durban Municipality whom wanted to take their homes.They succeeded gain the compensation for the act. Through the cooperation with Indira Gandhi, she organized scholarship for South African students to study medicine and the political sciences in India. IBR does tutorial programmes to improve the low matric pass rate and Phambili High was founded in 1986 for African students.

In 1992,(2 years before the first democratic election) Fatima Meer founded the Clare Estate Environment Group as a response to the needs of shack dwellers and rural migrants. They have no right in urban areas and need clean water, sanitation and proper settlement. Khanyisa School Project was founded in 1993 as a preparatory school for underprivileged African children before they go to formal school. She was also founded Khanya Women&#x27;s Skills Training Centre in 1996, which teach 150 Black women in pattern-cutting, sewing, adult literacy and business management.

== Personal life ==
Fatima Meer married her first cousin in 1950, Ismail Meer. This was not uncommon in the Sunni Bhora community where she grew up. Ismail Meer was a prominent lawyer and anti-apartheid activist. He was an active member of the KwaZulu-Natal ANC provincial legislature. In the 1960s he was arrested and charged with treason, along with Nelson Mandela, and other activists. In 1995, Fatima Meer&#x27;s son Rashid died in a car accident. She is survived by two daughters Shehnaz, a Land Claims Court judge, and Shamim, a social science consultant.

== Academic and writer ==

Meer became a lecturer of sociology and a staff member of the University of Natal from 1956 to 1988. She was the first non-white person to hold that position. She was also a visiting professor at a number of universities in abroad. Meer became a fellow of the London School of Economics, and received three honorary doctorates. First, she received an Honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Swarthmore College (1984) and in Humane Letters from Bennet College in the United States (1994).

Moreover, he succeeded the same ruler (Radu cel Frumos in Basarab&#x27;s case) on four occasions. Two of his reigns also surrounded the last period in which Vlad III the Impaler ruled over Wallachia.

In 1479 he joined in the Battle of Breadfield, and died in December 1480.

<text>James Neil Hamilton (September 9, 1899 – September 24, 1984) was an American stage, film and television actor, best remembered for his role as Commissioner Gordon on the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series of the 1960s, having first played a character by that name in 1928&#x27;s &quot;Three Week-Ends&quot;. During his motion picture career, which spanned more than a half century, Hamilton performed in over 260 productions in the silent and sound eras.

==Acting career==
An only child, Hamilton was born in Lynn, Massachusetts. His show business career began when he secured a job as a shirt model in magazine advertisements.

After this, he became interested in acting and joined several stock companies, where he gained experience and training as an actor in professional stage productions. This allowed him to get his first film role, in Vitagraph&#x27;s &quot;The Beloved Impostor&quot; (1918). He got his big break in D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The White Rose&quot; (1923). He traveled to Germany with Griffith and made a film about the incredibly harsh conditions in Germany after World War I, &quot;Isn&#x27;t Life Wonderful&quot; (1924).

While he was filming &quot;America&quot; (1924), a soldier&#x27;s arm was blown off. Actor Charles Emmett Mack recalled: &quot;Neil Hamilton and I went to neighboring towns and raised a fund for him—I doing a song and dance and Neil collecting a coin.&quot;

Hamilton was signed by Paramount Pictures in the mid-1920s and became one of its leading men. He often appeared opposite Bebe Daniels. He played one of Ronald Colman&#x27;s brothers in Paramount&#x27;s original silent version of &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1926) and Nick Carraway in the first film of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1926), now a lost film. He starred with Victor McLaglen in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Mother Machree&quot; (1928), whose title became the catchphrase of Gordon&#x27;s associate Chief O&#x27;Hara (played by Stafford Repp) on the &quot;Batman&quot; television series almost four decades later. Machree is likely an English representation of the Irish phrase &quot;mo chroí&quot;, meaning &quot;my heart&quot;, and has identical pronunciation.

In 1930, Hamilton appeared in the original production of &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; (retitled &quot;Flight Commander&quot; after its remake), playing the squadron commander, who was played by Basil Rathbone in the 1938 remake. Hamilton was billed above newcomer Clark Gable in &quot;Laughing Sinners&quot; (1931), in which he played a cad who deserts Joan Crawford&#x27;s brokenhearted character. He originated the role of milksop Harry Holt, Jane&#x27;s fiancé, in &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; (1932), where he got top billing. Hamilton reprised the role in the pre-Code sequel &quot;Tarzan and His Mate&quot; (1934) at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He made five films in England in 1936 and 1937.

&quot;A&quot;-level work in Hollywood dried up for Hamilton by the 1940s, and he was reduced to working in serials, &quot;B&quot; films, and other low-budget projects. He starred as the villain in &quot;King of the Texas Rangers&quot; (1941), one of the Republic Pictures most successful movie serials.

In &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944), about life on the home front in World War II, Hamilton is seen only in still photographs as a serviceman away at war. His family&#x27;s travails during his absence are the center of the movie. Hamilton reportedly shot scenes for the movie before filmmakers decided to keep his character off-screen. He appeared in the film noir &quot;When Strangers Marry&quot; (1944) with Robert Mitchum.

In a 1970s book interview for &quot;Whatever Happened to...&quot;, Hamilton said he had been banned from A level work for insulting a studio executive. A Roman Catholic, Hamilton said that his faith got him through the difficult period of late 1942 to early 1944 when he could not obtain film employment and was down on his luck financially.

When television came along, Hamilton hosted &quot;Hollywood Screen Test&quot; (1948-1953), co-starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;That Wonderful Guy&quot; with Jack Lemmon (1949–50), at the same time as Hollywood Screen Test, and did guest shots on numerous series of the 1950s and 1960s, such as seven episodes of &quot;Perry Mason&quot;: in 1958 he played murder victim Bertrand Allred in &quot;The Case of the Lazy Lover&quot; and Grove Dillingham in &quot;The Case of the Drifting Dropout&quot; in 1964. He was in five episodes of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;. He appeared on &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo,&quot; &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, and &quot;The Cara Williams Show&quot;. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hamilton performed on Broadway in &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; (1945), &quot;The Men We Marry&quot; (1948), &quot;To Be Continued&quot; (1952), and &quot;Late Love&quot; (1953–54).

In 1960, actor Richard Cromwell was seeking a comeback of sorts in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s planned production of &quot;The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come&quot; but Cromwell died of complications from liver cancer. Producer Maury Dexter quickly signed Hamilton to replace Cromwell in the film, which co-starred Jimmie Rodgers and Chill Wills. During the 1960s, Hamilton appeared in three Jerry Lewis films: &quot;The Patsy&quot; (1964), &quot;The Family Jewels&quot; (1965), and &quot;Which Way to the Front?&quot; (1970).

Hamilton co-starred in the Season One episode of &quot;The Munsters&quot;, Autumn Croakus, as a conman named Malcolm. He also appeared as Police Commissioner James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon in all 120 episodes of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series (1966–68) as well as the 1966 film of the same name. Yvonne Craig, who played Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s daughter Barbara, said Hamilton &quot;came every day to the set letter perfect in dialogue and never missed a beat—a consummate professional.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hamilton was married to Elsa Whitmer from 1922 until his death in September 1984. They had one child.

Hamilton was a Roman Catholic, and a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.

Hamilton died at the age of 85 on September 24, 1984, in Escondido, California, after suffering a severe asthma attack. After his cremation, his ashes were later scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

<text>Callington () is a civil parish and town in east Cornwall, England, United Kingdom about north of Saltash and south of Launceston.

Callington parish had a population of 4,783 in 2001, according to the 2001 census. This had increased to 5,786 in the 2011 census.

==Geography==
The town is situated in east Cornwall between Dartmoor to the east and Bodmin Moor to the west. A former agricultural market town, it lies at the intersection of the south–north A388 Saltash to Launceston road and the east–west A390 Tavistock to Liskeard road.

Kit Hill is a mile north-east of the town and rises to with views of Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor and the River Tamar.

The hamlets of Bowling Green, Kelly Bray, Frogwell and Downgate are in the parish.

===Railway station===

Callington railway station was the terminus of a branch line from Bere Alston, the junction with the Southern Railway&#x27;s Tavistock to Plymouth line. The railway line beyond Gunnislake to the Callington terminus was closed in the 1960s, due to low usage and difficult operating conditions on the final sections of the line due to several severe gradients and speed restrictions. One can still travel by rail on the Tamar Valley Line from Plymouth as far as Gunnislake via Bere Alston, where trains reverse. For most of its journey the line follows the River Tamar. Gunnislake is the nearest railway station to Callington, although the nearest mainline station is at Saltash.

==Economy==
Food manufacturers Ginsters and The Cornwall Bakery (both wholly owned subsidiaries of Samworth Brothers) are the largest employers in the town.

Ginsters uses local produce in many of its products, buying potatoes and other vegetables from local farmers and suppliers.

Historic listed building The Old Clink on Tillie St, built in 1851 as a lock-up for drunks and vagrants, is now used as the offices for a local driving school.

There is also a Tesco supermarket, opened in 2010, which employs 200 local people.

==History and antiquities==
Callington has been postulated as one of the possible locations of the ancient site of &quot;Celliwig&quot;, associated with King Arthur. Nearby ancient monuments include Castlewitch Henge, with a diameter of 96 m and Cadsonbury Iron Age hillfort, as well as Dupath Well built in 1510 on the site of an ancient sacred spring.

Callington was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086); the manor had four hides of land and land for thirty ploughs. The lord had land for three ploughs with eleven serfs. Twenty-four villeins and fourteen smallholders had land for fifteen ploughs. There were also one and a half square leagues of pasture and a small amount of woodland. The income of the manor was £6 sterling.

In 1601 Robert Rolle (died 1633) purchased the manor of Callington, thereby gaining the pocket borough seat of Callington in Parliament, which in future served to promote the careers of many Rolles. He nominated to this seat his brother William Rolle (died 1652) in 1604 and 1614, his son Sir Henry Rolle (1589–1656), of Shapwick, in 1620 and 1624, his son-in-law Thomas Wise (died March 1641) of Sydenham in Devon, in 1625, and another son John Rolle (1598–1648),

In the 19th century, Callington was one of the most important mining areas in Great Britain. Deposits of silver were found nearby in Silver Valley. Today, the area is marked by mining remains, but there are no active mines. Granite is still quarried on Hingston Down.

The former Callington constituency, a rotten borough, elected two members to the unreformed House of Commons but was abolished by the Reform Act 1832. The town is now in the South East Cornwall constituency.

St Mary&#x27;s Church was originally a chapel of ease to South Hill; it was consecrated in 1438 and then had two aisles and a buttressed tower; a second north aisle was added in 1882. Unusually for Cornwall there is a clerestory; the wagon roofs are old. The parish church contains the fine brass of Nicholas Assheton and his wife, 1466.

In the churchyard there is a Gothic lantern cross. It was first mentioned by the historian William Borlase in 1752. Each of the four faces of the cross head features a carved figure beneath an ogee arch. The heads of these figures have been chiselled off, no doubt in the Commonwealth period.

==Governance==
Callington is one of a small number of towns to continue to appoint a Portreeve; originally a medieval revenue officer and now an honorary title given to the chairman of the town council. Callington Town Council has twelve members and covers the civil parish of Callington. At the Council elections in 2013 only ten candidates stood, eight Independents and two Mebyon Kernow Councillors. The current portreeve of the town is Peter Watson.

==Development==
In recent years, the town has seen much residential development with more, including social housing, planned for the next few years. The neighbouring village of Kelly Bray has almost doubled in size in recent years with houses still being built in the area. A housing estate named Meadowbrook is in the process of being built.

==Twinning==
Callington is twinned with Guipavas in Brittany, France, and Barsbüttel near Hamburg in Germany. It also has unofficial friendship links with Keila in Estonia.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from either the Caradon Hill or Redruth TV transmitters. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cornwall on 95.2 FM, Heart West on 105.1 FM and Pirate FM on 102.2 FM. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Cornish &amp; Devon Post&quot; which publishes on Thursdays.

==Sport==
Callington has both football and cricket teams. Callington Town Football Club (established 1989) has four adult teams playing in the South West Peninsula League, East Cornwall League, Duchy League and South West Regional Women&#x27;s Football League. They all play at Marshfield Parc, which backs onto Callington Community College. Callington Cricket Club has three teams playing in the Cornwall Cricket League and play their games at Moores Park. Callington Badminton Club plays on a Friday from 1900hrs till 2200hrs at the Community College sports hall. They play in the Plymouth &amp; District league and run two men&#x27;s teams, a Ladies team and a mixed/medley team. The club is open to all ages and abilities so everyone is welcome. Callington Bowling Club (established 1946) is based at Chantry Park, off the Liskeard Road. The club has men&#x27;s teams playing in the Cornwall League, East Cornwall League, and the Plymouth and District League. Ladies teams play in Rippon, Date, and Tamar Leagues. The club also run 3 mixed shortmat teams during the winter months.

<text>Basarab IV cel Tânăr (&quot;the Young&quot;), also known as Țepeluș (&quot;the little Impaler&quot;), (before 1444 ? – 23 March 1482) son of Basarab II, and grandson of Dan II (1422-1431) was 4 times the voivode of the principality of Wallachia between 1474 and 1482: from Oct to Dec 1474, from Jan 1478 to June 1480, from Nov 1480 to before July 1481, and again from Aug 1481 to July 1482.

This was during an unstable political climate in medieval Wallachia that had another 4 princes ruling for some periods of time in those years.

== Reigns ==

Basarab IV Țepeluș acceded first to the Wallachian throne in 1474, when with help from Transylvanian voivode Stefan Bathory he overthrew his first cousin Basarab III known as the &#x27;Old&#x27;. He was then removed from power within 2 months by Radu III (also called Radu the Handsome), his 2nd cousin, who was brought in by a large Ottoman army who was marching to punish Stephen III of Moldavia.

Following his first rule Basarab IV Țepeluș sought refuge back in the Hungarian territories, where he most likely spent most of his life up to that point. In summer 1476 he is dispatched to Transylvania with Vlad III Țepeș (Țepeș = the Impaler) who was preferred by king Matthias Corvinus and Stephen III for the throne of Wallachia &amp; subsequently moves to Moldavia where he was mentioned at the court of Stephen III. It is with the latter&#x27;s help that before Jan 1478 Basarab Țepeluș again ousted his cousin Basarab Laiotă and starts his 2nd and longest reign.

In 1479 Basarab IV was forced by Ali Koca Bey to side with Ottomans and take part in the Ottoman campaign against Transylvania, providing some 5,000 Wallachian troops to the campaign, where he faced his arch-rival cousin Basarab who had also been living in Transylvania since his overthrow in 1477. Basarab IV brought approx.: 2,000 infantry to the campaign, and with help from Hungarians defeated the combined forces of Wallachia and the Ottomans at the Battle of Breadfield.

In 1481, the same year Mehmed II died and conflict between his two surviving sons, Bayezid II and Cem erupted into open conflict, Vlad IV, the pious half-brother of Vlad III and Radu III, who until now had shown little interest the throne for himself before now was placed on the throne by Ştefan III., who had invaded Wallachia that June and routed Basarab IV at Râmnicu Vâlcea.

The 15th century was a very volatile time in Wallachia, with the throne passing first from one then to another of the many Princes and family members of both Branches of the House of Basarab that desired it, and soon enough (i.e. July 1481) Basarab IV was again Voivode of Wallachia, with Ottoman support. Ştefan made a last attempt to secure his influence in Wallachia the next summer. and within the year Basarab lost the throne again. Although Vlad IV was restored, he was soon forced to accept the Sultan&#x27;s suzerainty.

== Death ==
Basarab IV was killed during the clashes around Mar-Jul of 1482, perhaps due to a conspiracy led by the boyars of Wallachia. Others however suggest he died in battle by Ștefan III during Ștefan III&#x27;s invasion that year.

Later on, Neagoe Craiovescu, who had acceded to the throne of Wallachia under the name Neagoe Basarab, claimed that Basarab IV was his father by having had an affair with his mother Neaga, who was then married to grand boyar Pârvu Craiovescu. While the Craiovești clan was close with the Dănești branch of the Wallachian ruling family, the claim is highly questionable but was used later on to support its princely origins.

<text>AMF Bowling (AMF Bowling Worldwide) is a major operator of bowling centers and major manufacturer of bowling equipment.

The AMF brand continues in use by the following companies:

* In the United States and Mexico, for the AMF Bowling centers owned or operated by Bowlero Corporation.
* In the United Kingdom, for the AMF bowling centres owned by Hollywood Bowl Group.
* Worldwide, for bowling equipment manufactured and marketed by QubicaAMF Worldwide (some customized AMF-branded bowling balls separately manufactured and marketed by 900 Global).

The bowling centers are ten-pin bowling centers where bowling may be purchased per game, per hour, or as part of a birthday party or corporate event package. Many locations support bowling leagues. Because many of the AMF-branded bowling centers were acquired from other parties, some centers may use bowling equipment manufactured or distributed by other companies such as Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards and Switch International Bowling instead of AMF-branded equipment.

==History==
The American Machine and Foundry (known after 1970 as AMF, Inc.) moved into the bowling business after World War II, when AMF automated bowling equipment and bowling centers became profitable business ventures, and in subsequent years into many other manufacturing businesses. Aging production facilities and increasing quality control problems in some product lines caused sales declines in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The company&#x27;s vast diversified output proved difficult to efficiently manage, and the company began to experience losses. Bowling remained quite profitable, however, so the company began a campaign of expansion in this area, spending nearly $100 million on acquisitions of bowling centers in 1984 and 1985. In 1985, corporate raider Irwin L. Jacobs&#x27;s Minstar, Inc. bought AMF Inc. and began to sell its various business divisions.

Commonwealth Venture Partners, a group of private investors in Richmond, Virginia, paid $225 million in 1985 to purchase the bowling center and bowling products divisions, forming AMF Bowling Companies, Inc. (later known as AMF Bowling Worldwide). In 1996 Goldman Sachs paid $1.4 billion to buy the company from Commonwealth Ventures. AMF Bowling went public with its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1997. In 1998 its stock price plummeted as losses mounted, so expansion plans were put on hold. In 1999 the decision was made to downsize. By 2000 the company was more than $1 billion in debt and was delisted.

AMF Bowling entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the first time in April 2001, stating that it had “overextended itself by acquiring 260 additional bowling centers that it had struggled to manage,” and that the demand for bowling products had decreased. Private equity firm Code Hennessy &amp; Simmons bought the company in 2004 for $670 million to bring it out of bankruptcy. The transaction was financed in part by a $254 million sale and lease-back of 186 bowling centers to iStar Financial. Shortly after, the company began shedding its “non-core, foreign assets” to focus on improving the operations of its remaining centers. Fred Hipp, the former California Pizza Kitchen top executive who became president and CEO in 2004, said the strategy would now be to “bring as much focus as possible to the management of our core U.S. center and bowling products businesses.&quot; In 2005, AMF Bowling&#x27;s products division and Italian-based Qubica Worldwide formed a 50/50 joint venture, QubicaAMF Worldwide.

AMF Bowling went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in November 2012. In its filing the company cited the challenge of adjusting to “the marked shift in the average bowling customer”. In 2013, AMF Bowling was brought out of bankruptcy through its merger with Strike Holdings LLC (doing business as the bowling center operator Bowlmor Lanes), bringing all remaining bowling centers and the 50% interest in the QubicaAMF joint venture under the control of Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation). Bowlmor AMF sold its QubicaAMF joint venture interest to Qubica in 2014.

==Bowling centers==

At the formation of AMF Bowling in 1986, Commonwealth Ventures acquired the 110 AMF-owned bowling centers in the United States and abroad, as well as the 22 centers owned by one of the partners in Commonwealth Ventures, Major League Bowling Corp. Commonwealth then spent nearly $500 million revitalizing the bowling center business with a focus on expanding the appeal of bowling to league and casual bowlers. In 1991 the company hired former PepsiCo executive Mark Willoughby to head the bowling center business. Willoughby set out to make AMF Bowling the “McDonald&#x27;s of bowling”.

The company became the largest owner of bowling centers in the US in 1995 with the acquisition of Fair Lanes, which the year before had been through a leveraged buyout, filed for bankruptcy, and then emerged from it as it struggled to get the cash needed to renovate its centers. The addition of Fair Lanes&#x27;s 106 bowling centers brought AMF Bowling&#x27;s total to 205 centers in the US and 79 overseas.

When Goldman Sachs acquired the company in 1996, its strategy was to clean up purchased properties and create a national chain of amusement complexes. That year, the company bought Bowling Corporation of America from closely held Charan Industries, adding 50 more bowling centers. In that same year it purchased 43 centers from American Recreation Centers. In 1997, the company acquired 15 centers from Conbow Corporation. By the start of 1999, AMF Bowling operated 421 centers in the United States, 46 in Australia, 37 in the United Kingdom, and 41 in eight other countries.

After emerging from bankruptcy in 2005, the company sold its centers in Australia and the United Kingdom in 2004 and 2005.

When it entered bankruptcy for the second time in 2012, the company observed, “In the 1960s and 70s… the typical bowler was a blue collar factory worker who belonged to one or more bowling leagues. Today’s typical bowler comes from a broader swath of the middle-class, and is unlikely to bowl in a league. Non-league bowlers bowl less often. And when they do bowl, they expect nicer amenities – automatic scoring, a variety of food and beverage options, and more attractive facilities.” As evidence of the shift, the company noted that, “according to the United States Bowling Congress, in 1998 the nation’s three largest league bowling organizations had over 4.1 million members. Just a decade later, membership had declined by 36% to 2.6 million.” To respond to the change in the average bowling customer, AMF constructed nine upscale 300 Centers with “high-end bars and lounges designed with a modern décor” that drew “significant business through group events.” However, the Great Recession of 2008 eroded AMF&#x27;s ability to maintain and enhance its 262 existing US bowling centers and meant that people were bowling less often. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, AMF owned 27 bowling centers, leased 186 bowling centers through agreements with iStar Financial, and leased 57 under agreements with various other parties.

The 2013 merger brought the remaining US and Mexico centers under the control of a new entity, Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation), making it the largest owner and operator of bowling centers in the United States. In the three years prior to the reorganization, AMF Bowling had closed nine owned US centers and 33 leased US centers due to &quot;declining operating performance, unattractive options to renew leases, or an attractive sales opportunity.&quot; That left 257 AMF bowling centers in the United States and eight in Mexico passing to Bowlmor AMF at the time of the reorganization.

==Bowling equipment==

The American Machine and Foundry &quot;Pinspotter&quot;, developed in 1951 and first marketed in 1952, was one of the first fully automated pinspotters used in quantity in the bowling industry. When Commonwealth Ventures acquired the bowling center and bowling equipment divisions of AMF, Inc. to form AMF Bowling in 1985, its new company was already a major manufacturer of pinspotters, bowling pins, bowling balls, ball returns, lane surfaces, automatic scoring equipment, and other bowling equipment.

In 2005, AMF Bowling&#x27;s equipment division and Italian-based Qubica Worldwide formed a 50/50 joint venture, QubicaAMF Worldwide. The partnership combined Qubica&#x27;s expertise in automatic scoring technology and AMF Bowling&#x27;s technology in lane equipment and pinspotters.

In 2007, a new company, 900 Global, purchased the rights to sell customized bowling balls with the AMF logo. In February 2014, the principals of bowling ball manufacturer Storm Products, Inc. made a significant investment in 900 Global.

With AMF Bowling&#x27;s exit from bankruptcy in 2013, the 50% interest in the QubicaAMF joint venture was brought under the control of Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation).

In December 2014, the Qubica original founders acquired the 50% interest held by Bowlmor AMF (Bowlero), bringing the manufacturing and marketing of AMF-branded bowling equipment under the full control of QubicaAMF Worldwide.

<text>A notable molecule editor is a computer program for creating and modifying representations of chemical structures.

Molecule editors can manipulate chemical structure representations in either a simulated two-dimensional space or three-dimensional space, via 2D computer graphics or 3D computer graphics, respectively. Two-dimensional output is used as illustrations or to query chemical databases. Three-dimensional output is used to build molecular models, usually as part of molecular modelling software packages.

Database molecular editors such as Leatherface, RECAP, and Molecule Slicer allow large numbers of molecules to be modified automatically according to rules such as &#x27;deprotonate carboxylic acids&#x27; or &#x27;break exocyclic bonds&#x27; that can be specified by a user.

Molecule editors typically support reading and writing at least one file format or line notation. Examples of each include Molfile and simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES), respectively.

Files generated by molecule editors can be displayed by molecular graphics tools.

<doc id="1111562" wikidata="Q667216" url="?curid=1111562" title="Teesside International Airport">
<text>Teesside International Airport , formerly Durham Tees Valley Airport, is a medium sized international airport in the Borough of Darlington, County Durham, England. It primarily serves Teesside (including Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees) south and mid County Durham (including Darlington) and north North Yorkshire.

The airport has a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Public Use Aerodrome Licence (number P518) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers and for flight instruction. Tees Valley Combined Authority owns three-quarters of the airport and Teesside Airport Foundation owns the remainder.

Originally Royal Air Force (RAF) station Middleton St George, the aerodrome became Tees-Side Airport in 1964, Teesside International Airport in 1987, and Durham Tees Valley Airport in 2004 before reverting to Teesside International Airport in 2019 following a poll indicating 93% of locals preferred the name, with the change occurring on 25 July 2019. &#x27;Teesside Airport&#x27; was common on local road signs that were either placed before 2004 or on signs with limited space for the then airport title.

==History==
===RAF Middleton St George===

The aerodrome began life in January 1941 as Royal Air Force Station Middleton St. George or RAF Goosepool as known to the locals (though it has never officially held that name). It was the most northerly of all Bomber Command airfields, home to both RAF and Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons during WWII, and exclusively RAF post-war. Bombing missions from the station included those to Berlin, Hanover, Kassel, Mannheim and Munich. Of the many military aircraft based at the aerodrome, it is best known as home to the Avro Lancaster during the war and English Electric Lightning in the 1960s. In 1957, the runway was extended to its current length of 7,516 ft (2,291m). The RAF station was closed in 1964 and the airfield sold to the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

===Tees-Side Airport===

The former RAF Station was then developed into a civil airport. The first civilian flight from the newly named &quot;Tees-Side Airport&quot; took place on 18 April 1964 with a Mercury Airlines service to Manchester. On 1 November 1966, the international passenger terminal was opened by Princess Margaretha of Sweden.

The IATA code for the new airport was determined as MME; however, the meaning of this is disputed. Long term employees and tenants from the 1960s claim Middleton St George AerodroME, but because of the lack of certainty, the current management have unofficially adopted Middleton Military Establishment as a nod to the military origins. Middlesbrough Municipal AerodromE is also often quoted. However the latter seems unlikely as the Airport is actually located in Darlington, County Durham.

In the early days, the airport developed a network of mainly scheduled routes, with limited inclusive tour charter flights. The destinations were consistent but the airlines were not, with British Midland, BKS Air Transport, Dan-Air, Autair and Channel Airways all coming and going before the turn of the decade. In November 1969 British Midland returned when they were awarded the licence to fly the London Heathrow route, which they continued operating until 28 March 2009.

The 1970s saw a decline in regional services but a growth in holiday flights, courtesy of Northeast Airlines (a rebranded BKS Air Transport) and Britannia Airways, as well as overseas operators such as Aviaco, Spantax and Aviogenex amongst others.

On 19 October 1971, the Teesside Airport railway station opened, with a shuttle bus running between the station and the terminal.

In 1974, the shares were divided between the newly formed Cleveland and Durham County Councils. Also during the year, the CAA declared Tees-Side should be the primary airport for the North East of England, ultimately however Newcastle International Airport prospered.

The 1980s saw scheduled routes resurge thanks to home-grown airline Casair Aviation Services, who had started out as an air taxi operator in 1972. In October 1982, Casair merged with Genair of Liverpool and Eastern Airways of Humberside (the airline of the same name still based there today is a Phoenix company) under the Genair name, and one month later the first UK regional feeder franchise network was launched when Genair partnered with British Caledonian, trading under the British Caledonian Commuter Services banner. Unfortunately the new venture only lasted until July 1984 when Genair collapsed, causing the loss of 11 out of 18 routes for Tees-Side Airport. Luckily, the airport valued the services more than owed fees, leading to Casair being reborn and taking over Genair services to Glasgow and Humberside, which they operated initially on behalf of Air Ecosse and then independently.

On 11 December 1982, the airport chartered Concorde for the day, it would visit twice more before its retirement, on 23 August 1986 for the air show and 30 April 1995.

===Teesside International I===
In 1987, the airport was privatised, with Cleveland and Durham local authorities retaining their shares. As part of this process the airport rebranded from Tees-Side Airport to Teesside International Airport.

1990 saw the one millionth aircraft movement at the airport, in the form of a British Midland service to London Heathrow. In 1996 when Cleveland County Council was abolished, the airport ownership was divided amongst local Borough Councils. Passenger numbers grew steadily from 1993 based upon an expanding holiday charter business.

In 1994, Airtours arrived on the scene and from 1997 based a summer seasonal aircraft at the airport, this coupled with other tour operator expansion propelled the airport to new heights.

In 2002, the airport sought a strategic partner to assist with future development and Peel Airports Ltd was selected as the preferred company, taking a 75% stake in the airport, to be increased to 89% after 10 years, with a commitment to invest £20million over the first five years.

Peel brought Teesside into the low cost era by securing bmibaby who based initially one, later two aircraft at the airport, ultimately giving the airport its peak years.

===Durham Tees Valley===
On 21 September 2004, the airport was renamed Durham Tees Valley Airport at the request of bmibaby, who felt the new name placed the airport better geographically as many of the airport&#x27;s passengers, particularly those from outside the UK, were unfamiliar with the location of Teesside, whilst Durham was better known. The move was widely condemned by the local population who felt passionately about the name Teesside, and considered the term Tees Valley to be geographically inaccurate, as there is no such valley.

Shortly afterwards, a new access road, terminal front and terminal interior were completed. The remainder of a planned £56 million expansion and development programme would have enabled the airport to handle up to 3 million passengers annually. However the plan never materialised due to falling passenger numbers after 2006

In late summer 2006, bmibaby announced their surprise departure from Durham Tees Valley Airport. Peel were quick to replace them with Flyglobespan who opened an initial two-aircraft base.

Passenger numbers peaked in 2006 when the airport was used by 917,963 passengers. However, since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, numbers declined to 130,911 in 2017 before starting to rise again in 2018. A side effect of the crisis saw a number of airline bankruptcies or mergers, greatly reducing the number of potential operators for the airport to pursue. Those that merged consolidated at the larger regional airports, leading to the likes of Newcastle and Leeds expanding, whilst local airports such as Durham Tees Valley continued to struggle for several years.

In 2010, Vancouver Airport Services purchased a controlling 65% stake in Peel Airports Ltd and in December 2011, placed the airport up for sale. This led to the Peel Group purchasing their 75% share back on 10 February 2012 under a new subsidiary, Peel Investments (DTVA) Ltd.

In November 2010, the airport introduced the Passenger Facility Fee of £6 per adult to curb the airport&#x27;s losses. Passengers had to purchase a ticket from a machine before being allowed to proceed through security. Similar schemes were at the time already in place at other small English airports including Blackpool, Newquay and Norwich. Passenger numbers during 2011 were 15% lower compared to 2010.

On 11 January 2011, Ryanair left the airport after ending their service to Alicante Airport, having previously served Dublin Airport, Girona Airport and Rome Ciampino Airport. They decided to leave the airport before the introduction of the Passenger Facility Fee, being notoriously against such charges.

Other developments included new airfield lighting installed and during 2012, six-figure sums spent revamping the terminal building and renovating one of the World War II-era hangars.

On 30 October 2013, after it became clear the market wasn&#x27;t going to yield any further charter flights, the airport announced it would no longer accept such flights as part of cost-cutting plans that would see the airport diversify into a business airport. The airport stated it would instead focus on scheduled routes and non-passenger related aviation such as cargo/general aviation. The news was part of a master plan for the airport site, including residential and commercial development, released in November 2013. Peel would later reverse the decision with the return of Balkan Holidays to Burgas for summer 2019, with further large scale expansion from two major holiday companies lined up, but stopped because of the 2018 takeover.

In November 2013, Peel Group released a master plan titled &quot;Master Plan to 2020 and Beyond&quot;, covering the period up to 2050. This was followed up with a number of consultation events across the region with both the public and business community, the airport then took the feedback into consideration before releasing a final draft in April 2014.

Under the master plan, inclusive tour charter flights were axed as unprofitable. The cornerstone of the master plan was a housing estate which would have raised up to £30M to be reinvested back into the airport under a &#x27;Section 106&#x27; agreement. This resulted in heavy opposition from the local public. The houses were located on land too far removed from the existing airport infrastructure to be used for aviation development, and outline planning permission was received on 29 March 2017.

On 18 May 2017, Durham Tees Valley Airport announced significant investment to the airport&#x27;s terminal facilities. Alongside extensive renovations in the departures area, improved retail services were introduced under the new in-house &#x27;Xpress&#x27; brand. The first phase of investment was completed in September 2017, with the second phase starting in Autumn 2017. The airport&#x27;s Privilege Membership Club also faced improvements for passenger service upgrades.

Later in May 2017, Durham Tees Valley Airport introduced a new in-house ground handling service called Consort Aviation. Ground handling services are provided for general aviation, cargo and military aircraft.

During November 2017, the airport launched its &quot;Flying For The Future&quot; campaign to try to build support towards the airport and encourage more people to use the facility.

====2018 takeover====
On 4 December 2018, the Mayor of the Tees Valley Ben Houchen announced a £40M deal had been agreed to buy Peel Airport&#x27;s 89% majority shareholding in Durham Tees Valley Airport (made up of £35M for the airport and £5M for land with planning permission for 350 houses) which if approved would bring the airport back into public ownership for the first time since it was sold to Peel in 2003. Purchasing the airport was Houchen&#x27;s primary election pledge in his campaign in the 2017 Tees Valley mayoral election. The deal would be completed subject to ratification from the leaders of the five local authorities that made up the Tees Valley Combined Authority who were to vote on the deal in January 2019 at a purpose emergency TVCA meeting called by the Mayor. An established airport operator thought to be the Stobart Aviation had been lined up to run the facility.

Should the Mayor&#x27;s plan to buy back the airport be approved by TVCA, Houchen said he planned to give local residents the opportunity to decide whether to change the airport&#x27;s name back to Teesside International Airport. An online poll was conducted in December 2018 with the option of continuing with the Durham Tees Valley name or reverting to the airport&#x27;s former name of Teesside International. Of the 14,000 people who took part, 93% voted for the name to revert to Teesside International.

On 24 January 2019, the six TVCA leaders unanimously voted in favour of the plan, bringing the airport back under public ownership after 16 years in the private sector.

On 14 March 2019, the Mayor held a press conference at the airport confirming Stobart Aviation as the new airport operator. Stobart would invest in a 25% stake in the new holding company with the TVCA owning the majority 75% (it was expected that prior to this the individual local authority shares would be transferred across to the TVCA).

The takeover came at a time the airport was back on the rise, the 2017 terminal refurbishment was fuelling growth in passenger numbers, Peel had invested in a new £3.5M radar system which went live in 2021, and they had &quot;one of the largest increases in flights at the airport since the financial crash in 2007&quot; lined up from &quot;two major holiday companies&quot;, which the Mayor blocked in favour of using the start-up subsidies on solicitors and consults for the takeover instead. The airport announced a new summer holiday route to Majorca for the 2020 summer season and the renewal of the 2019 Burgas route also for 2020.

===Renaming to Teesside International===
On 25 July 2019, the airport was renamed Teesside International Airport, the name it operated under between 1987 and 2004.

In January 2020, flights to multiple destinations were announced by Eastern Airways to Belfast City, Cardiff, Dublin, Isle of Man, London City and Southampton, including a relaunch of their long established Aberdeen route. Routes to Newquay, Alicante and London Heathrow were later added, the latter for the first time in over a decade. By November, these routes were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A major global aircraft maintenance firm, Willis Lease Finance Corporation, were announced as a new tenant on 15 May 2020. They announced a £25M investment in the airport including two new hangars and a new Jet Centre facility on 18 July 2022. On 27 October 2020, TUI announced their return after nine years with a summer service to Majorca starting in May 2022. On 10 November 2020, Loganair announced flights to five destinations, all in competition with Eastern Airways, however Eastern never reinstated several of their routes following the pandemic leaving Loganair as the sole operator on most of them. On 25 November, Ryanair announced two flights a week to Palma de Mallorca and Alicante from June 2021. On 16 December 2020, a terminal refurbishment was announced including a second lounge, cafe and bar facilities, both landside and airside, as well as opening up previously closed areas.

In the 3 March 2021 annual Government budget announcement, the Tees Valley region was awarded Freeport status as well as Treasury North at Darlington (plus other departments announced since). Both expect to have long term benefits for the airport which is included as part of the freeport. On 23 April 2021, It was announced that the £6.00 passenger facility fee would be scrapped. On 12 May 2021, it was announced that duty-free shopping would return to the airport after an eight-year absence courtesy of World Duty-Free.

In 2021, Tees Valley Combined Authority announced a move from Cavendish House on Teesdale, Stockton-on-Tees to a new 1,360sq m base at the Teesside Airport site. The move completed in 2022.

On 7 February 2022, new details of a proposed Teesside Airport business park were announced. The new business park, based on the southside of the airport, will include a new 1.5 km link road running direct to the A67 and a new roundabout close to Wilkinson&#x27;s Plant Centre.

On 29 August 2022, the airport officially opened a new £2.5M cargo handling facility. The facility includes a purpose-built hangar with security screening technology, handling, freight-forwarding, customs clearage and storage. The facility can also be used for specialised charter flights for both air and road freight. Following the closure of Doncaster Sheffield Airport in November 2022, it is expected that some of their 10,000 tonnes of annual freight will now be handled by Teesside.

Teesside was the first airport in the UK to scrap the 100ml limit on liquids in hand luggage with the installation of new scanning equipment known as a C3 Scanner.

In August 2024 it was revealed that despite making a gross profit of £308,555 in the previous year, the airport still made an operating loss of £3M. The airport has also used £63M in taxpayer funded loans over four years.
Recently, Jet2 and Jet2Holidays have signed a contract with Willis aviation for maintenance.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and cargo flights to and from Teesside:


===Cargo===


==Other users==
Three multinational defence contractors are based on site. Draken Europe provide electronic countermeasure and aggressor training to the MoD using a fleet of Dassault Falcon 20 and Aero L-159E ALCA aircraft, and built a new hangar in 2022 to accommodate the latter. Serco operate their International Fire Training Centre, one of the largest in Europe, on the airport&#x27;s south side. Thales&#x27; calibration and flight inspection subsidiary is based at Teesside; it operates a Beech King Air and Diamond DA42 Twin Star.

US firm Willis Lease Finance Corporation subsidiary Willis Asset Management operate out of Hangar 2 at the airport and carry out maintenance and storage of a wide variety of commercial aircraft. Two further subsidiaries have since moved in: Willis Aviation Services are a ground handling company and Jet Centre by Willis now run the airport&#x27;s business aviation centre.

==Traffic statistics==
===Passengers and aircraft movements===
The airport saw strong growth from 1993 to 2006, when passenger numbers peaked at 917,963. Passenger numbers then declined steeply in the subsequent four years due to the financial crisis of 2007–2010. Passenger numbers continued to fall before stabilising in 2018 prior to the 2019 Covid pandemic that led to the almost complete shutdown of passenger air travel through most of 2020. Passenger numbers have since started to rise steadily in the years following Covid with new holiday destinations subsequently being introduced. Combined with the &quot;core&quot; business flights currently operating out of the airport, the owner&#x27;s long-term hope is of pushing passenger numbers beyond 1.4m in the next decade by attracting a low cost airline.

Freight volumes decreased at the airport from 2000 onwards, to effectively zero tonneage by 2010. Freight volumes began to increase again at the airport in 2023 as a result of a new cargo handling facility opening in late 2022. On 18 March 2024, it was announced that FedEx Express will schedule eight flights per week in and out of the airport by June 2024, significantly increasing freight volumes handled at the airport.



===Routes===
==Ground transport==

===Bus===
Stagecoach North East operates a bus service (No.6/6A) that runs from Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington to the airport hourly.

===Car===
The airport is situated off the A67 and is near the A1(M), A19 and A66 corridors. A significant upgrade to complete a fast link direct to the airport from the A66 was completed in 2008.

===Rail===
Currently, Dinsdale railway station, about 2 miles (3.2 km) away in the nearby village of Middleton St George, is the closest station with regular passenger services, as well as a direct bus link with the terminal.

As of April 2022, Teesside Airport railway station is temporarily closed. The station has always been sparsely served, receiving two trains per week until December 2017 when the service was reduced to just one train every Sunday. The airport is exploring the possibility of using more shuttle buses and &quot;horizontal escalators&quot; to boost patronage at the station in the future.

===Taxi===
Taxis are available directly outside the airport terminal.

<text>A form is a document which contains blank spaces (also named &quot;fields&quot; or &quot;placeholders&quot;) in which one can write or select an option. Forms can be distributed to several signatories at once, or made available on demand. Before being filled out, each copy of a form is usually identical, except, possibly, for a serial number. A form allows an organisation to collect a uniform set of data from many parties in a consistent manner.

Forms, when completed, vary in their purpose; for example, a form might be a statement, a request, or an order. A cheque may also be considered a form. In addition, there are several forms for taxes. An example is a tax return; filling one out is required in order for the amount of tax one owes to be determined. A form may also be a request for a tax refund.

Forms may be filled out in duplicate (or &quot;triplicate&quot;, meaning three times) when the information gathered on the form needs to be distributed to several departments within an organisation. This can be done using carbon paper.

== History ==
Forms have existed for a significant amount of time, with historians of law having discovered preprinted legal forms from the early 19th century that greatly simplified the task of drafting complaints and various other legal pleadings.

== Advantages ==
Advantages of forms include the following:
* One has to write less (while the printing is almost universally done in some automatic way).
* One is told or reminded what information has to be supplied.
* There is , for convenience in processing.
* Information is collected in writing and so can be reexamined later (the form can also include a signature field to allow someone to take responsibility for the accuracy of the information provided). 
* Simpler tasks, such as collecting or distributing data, can be separated in the workflow from more skilled processes, such as making decisions. Issuing and processing the forms may then be done by less skilled staff, or by a computer. The de-skilled task becomes issuing or completing the appropriate form for the circumstances, and then passing it on to the next step in the workflow. This might reduce costs and increase the volume of work that can be handled.

A form on a computer allows for conveniently typing in the variable parts (the input data). It can also ensure that all placeholders are filled in properly.

== Form structure ==
Like a usual document, a form typically contains fixed content. It also contains some placeholders which are meant to be filled in. Blank forms are generally not copyrightable in the US.

===Frame and fixed content===
The frame is the part of the document that never changes. It usually contains a title and textual instructions.

===Placeholders===
Placeholders, or fields, are boxes or spaces where one can write or type in order to fill out the form.

<doc id="1111566" wikidata="Q6417437" url="?curid=1111566" title="Kit Hill">
<text>Kit Hill (), at 334 metres high, dominates the area between Callington and the River Tamar in southeast Cornwall, England, UK. The word &#x27;Kit&#x27; comes from Old English for kite, a reference to birds of prey (and not specifically the red kite). Buzzards and sparrowhawks can still be seen on the hill. It is one of five Marilyn hills in Cornwall, the four others are Watch Croft, Brown Willy, Carnmenellis and Hensbarrow Beacon.

==Geography==
Kit Hill Country Park (which includes the hill and surrounding areas), was given to the people of Cornwall in 1985 to mark the birth of Prince William, by his father, the Duke of Cornwall (Prince Charles). It is managed by Cornwall Council, and consists of some 400 acres (152 hectares), making it the most dominant landscape feature in East Cornwall. Kit Hill is the highest point in the Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The hill was formed in the same way as nearby Bodmin Moor by the intrusion of magma into overlying sedimentary rocks. This caused the formation of many mineral deposits that were mined extensively in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

As the highest point of Hingston Down, Kit Hill is probably the best viewpoint in the southeast of Cornwall, with views of the Tamar valley, Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor. Kit Hill Country Park has a high wildlife population including deer and badgers, rabbits, rare moths and butterflies.

On the summit of Kit Hill is an artificial fort (a Civil War redoubt) and a folly built by Sir John Call of Whiteford, Stoke Climsland, built in the style of a low-walled Saxon castle.

==History==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that in 835 (corrected by scholars to 838 AD) Egbert king of the West Saxons defeated an army of Vikings and Cornish at &quot;Hengestdun&quot; = &quot;Stallion Hill&quot;, which is usually interpreted as being at Hingston Down.

Other notable artifacts on Kit Hill include Neolithic and Bronze Age barrows. The area around these is maintained by a ranger and volunteers, who also generally keep the vegetation on the hill under control.

==Mining==
The Country Park is steeped in mining history. Metals extracted included tin, silver, copper and tungsten.The main mines were:
* Kit Hill Summit Mines (which included a windmill near the present stack). These mines and shafts started about 1826: Kit Hill United closed in 1864.
* East Kit Hill Mine was worked from 1855 to 1909.
* Hingston Down mine (which worked westwards towards Kit Hill). This was a very early mine, and evidence shows it may have started in the 17th century: it closed in 1885.
* South Kit Hill Mine was worked from 1856 to 1884.

==Atomic Energy Authority==
In 1877 a company called Kit Hill Tunnel Ltd began work on both the south and north sides of the hill to create a tunnel which would be long. The southern portal was at Silver Hill, and that at the north was near a small mine called Excelsior. However, due to the toughness of the underlying bedrock, progress was costly and slow, and ceased about a year later. In 1881 a new company named Kit Hill Great Consols took over the setts of Kit Hill United and Excelsior mine. They deepened the North Engine Shaft to 112 fathoms and lengthened the tunnel running south to meet it. However, this too was proving too costly, and wound up in 1885, before it was half-way complete. Several later attempts were made to extend the Excelsior Tunnel, but by 1938, it was still only long.

However, in 1959 the Atomic Energy Authority took over operations, and used the tunnel for underground explosions. The activities were part of Operation Orpheus, and the Kit Hill events were the first part:
* Phase A: Small charges fired in a diameter cavity in granite and shale at depths of 100 to in the Excelsior Tunnel at Kit Hill.
* Phase B: Participation in the Operation Cowboy tests, where charges of would be detonated in diameter cavities at depths of in a salt mine in Louisiana, United States.
* Phase C: The tests at Greenside Mine in Cumbria, where a decoupled test and a coupled test would be carried out in andesite rock at a depth below surface of and the results compared. The charge sizes were chosen so that if the decoupling worked as predicted, the seismic signals would be similar in intensity.

==Railways==
Construction of The Tamar, Kit Hill &amp; Callington Railway started in 1864. The name was later changed to the East Cornwall Mineral Railway, and the line opened in 1872. Seven and a half miles long, it ran from Calstock&#x27;s river frontage, past Kelly Quay &amp; Drakewalls and the Gunnislake quarries, along the northern flank of Hingston Down to below Kit Hill at Kelly Bray, where an inclined tramway connected with it. It amalgamated with the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway crossing the Tamar above Calstock and onto the junction at Bere Alston.

The Gunnislake to Bere Alston section still survives as part of the Tamar Valley Line.

Some remnants, mainly the granite blocks, of the line can be found on the northern slopes of the Country Park site.

<text>The Ford Model K is an upscale automobile that was produced by Ford Motor Company. Introduced in 1906, the “K” replaced the earlier Model B. It was built at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant. The Model K was aimed at the top end of the market and featured an inline-6 (the only Ford six until 1941) giving 40 hp (30 kW). In typical Ford fashion, the Model K was the lowest priced six cylinder car, with among the best horsepower to weight ratio in its class. The wheelbase for 1906 was . For 1907 and 08, the Model was significantly improved with a longer wheelbase (120 inch), 20% more h.p., and stronger frame. It was also offered in both touring and runabout bodies.

Contrary to popular folklore, the Model K was a good seller for Ford Motor Company. In 1906, the first year it was offered, the Model K produced over 85 percent of Ford Motor Company&#x27;s new car profit (1906 Ford Motor Company internal audit records). 
In 1907, the second sales year of the Model K, almost 500 examples were sold, making it the best-selling six-cylinder model in the world.

As period journals reported, Ford Motor Company went in another direction, moving to one chassis, a mid-priced car, the Model T, leaving the multi-line business model used by most auto makers of the period. However, sales and profits from the Model K helped Ford Motor Company become the largest automaker in number of sales in 1907, and along with the Model N, was the only Ford model sold through three model years (1906–1908) prior to the advent of the Model T.

<text>The Heart of Princess Osra is an 1896 novel and is part of Anthony Hope&#x27;s trilogy of books which spawned the genre of Ruritanian romance. This collection of linked short stories is a prequel: it was written immediately after the success of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1894) and was published in 1896, but is set in the 1730s, well over a century before the events of the first novel and its sequel, &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; (1898). The stories are set in the fictional country of Ruritania, a Germanic kingdom, and deal with the love life of Princess Osra of the House of Elphberg. Osra is the younger sister of Rudolf III, the shared ancestor of Rudolf Rassendyll, the English gentleman who acts as political decoy in &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, and Rudolph V, the absolute monarch of Ruritania.

Literary scholar Shoshana Milgram Knapp has observed that Hope&#x27;s stories in the volume are both analytic of and acclamatory toward the inspiration of romantic love:
&quot;Osra&#x27;s physical beauty is a metaphor for spiritual beauty. Her name, the feminine form of &quot;Osric,&quot; is not an invention, but it is sufficiently unusual to suggest that the character is herself extraordinary, separated from life’s routine. Who will best love Osra? He who best knows her, and matches her. In Ruritania, love is the appreciation of the beloved’s uniqueness, accompanied by the commitment to rise to one’s best. And because Osra is not merely a prize to be valued, but a human being capable of valuing, she herself can learn what her suitors learn: that romantic love inspires extraordinary action.

&quot;The nine individual stories follow a pattern. A man meets Princess Osra, and immediately develops a consuming romantic passion for this extraordinary woman. In loyalty to his value, he performs an extraordinary act of courage, ingenuity, or passion. He does not act in order to win the princess’s affection, or to prove to her his worth. He performs his act, in most cases, without expecting Osra to recognize his deed, much less acknowledge or reward it. Sooner or later, Osra does in fact recognize and acknowledge the act; she does not, however, requite the love that inspired it.&quot;
Although &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; has been adapted many times for stage and screen, &quot;The Heart of Princess Osra&quot; has not.

<text>As described by the third of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion of classical mechanics, all forces occur in pairs such that if one object exerts a force on another object, then the second object exerts an equal and opposite reaction force on the first. The third law is also more generally stated as: &quot;To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.&quot; The attribution of which of the two forces is the action and which is the reaction is arbitrary. Either of the two can be considered the action, while the other is its associated reaction.

==Examples==

===Interaction with ground===
When something is exerting force on the ground, the ground will push back with equal force in the opposite direction. In certain fields of applied physics, such as biomechanics, this force by the ground is called &#x27;ground reaction force&#x27;; the force by the object on the ground is viewed as the &#x27;action&#x27;.

When someone wants to jump, he or she exerts additional downward force on the ground (&#x27;action&#x27;). Simultaneously, the ground exerts upward force on the person (&#x27;reaction&#x27;). If this upward force is greater than the person&#x27;s weight, this will result in upward acceleration. When these forces are perpendicular to the ground, they are also called a normal force.

Likewise, the spinning wheels of a vehicle attempt to slide backward across the ground. If the ground is not too slippery, this results in a pair of friction forces: the &#x27;action&#x27; by the wheel on the ground in backward direction, and the &#x27;reaction&#x27; by the ground on the wheel in forward direction. This forward force propels the vehicle.

===Gravitational forces===

The Earth, among other planets, orbits the Sun because the Sun exerts a gravitational pull that acts as a centripetal force, holding the Earth to it, which would otherwise go shooting off into space. If the Sun&#x27;s pull is considered an action, then Earth simultaneously exerts a reaction as a gravitational pull on the Sun. Earth&#x27;s pull has the same amplitude as the Sun but in the opposite direction. Since the Sun&#x27;s mass is so much larger than Earth&#x27;s, the Sun does not generally appear to react to the pull of Earth, but in fact it does, as demonstrated in the animation (not to precise scale). A correct way of describing the combined motion of both objects (ignoring all other celestial bodies for the moment) is to say that they both orbit around the center of mass, referred to in astronomy as the barycenter, of the combined system.

===Supported mass===
Any mass on earth is pulled down by the gravitational force of the earth; this force is also called its weight. The corresponding &#x27;reaction&#x27; is the gravitational force that mass exerts on the planet.

If the object is supported so that it remains at rest, for instance by a cable from which it is hanging, or by a surface underneath, or by a liquid on which it is floating, there is also a support force in upward direction (tension force, normal force, buoyant force, respectively). This support force is an &#x27;equal and opposite&#x27; force; we know this not because of Newton&#x27;s third law, but because the object remains at rest, so that the forces must be balanced.

To this support force there is also a &#x27;reaction&#x27;: the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude:

* F1. gravitational force by earth on object (downward)
* F2. gravitational force by object on earth (upward)
* F3. force by support on object (upward)
* F4. force by object on support (downward)

Forces F1 and F2 are equal, due to Newton&#x27;s third law; the same is true for forces F3 and F4.
Forces F1 and F3 are equal if and only if the object is in equilibrium, and no other forces are applied. (This has nothing to do with Newton&#x27;s third law.)

===Mass on a spring===
If a mass is hanging from a spring, the same considerations apply as before. However, if this system is then perturbed (e.g., the mass is given a slight kick upwards or downwards, say), the mass starts to oscillate up and down. Because of these accelerations (and subsequent decelerations), we conclude from Newton&#x27;s second law that a net force is responsible for the observed change in velocity. The gravitational force pulling down on the mass is no longer equal to the upward elastic force of the spring. In the terminology of the previous section, F1 and F3 are no longer equal.

However, it is still true that F1 = F2 and F3 = F4, as this is required by Newton&#x27;s third law.

==Causal misinterpretation==
The terms &#x27;action&#x27; and &#x27;reaction&#x27; have the misleading suggestion of causality, as if the &#x27;action&#x27; is the cause and &#x27;reaction&#x27; is the effect. It is therefore easy to think of the second force as being there because of the first, and even happening some time after the first. This is incorrect; the forces are perfectly simultaneous, and are there for the same reason.

When the forces are caused by a person&#x27;s volition (e.g. a soccer player kicks a ball), this volitional cause often leads to an asymmetric interpretation, where the force by the player on the ball is considered the &#x27;action&#x27; and the force by the ball on the player, the &#x27;reaction&#x27;. But physically, the situation is symmetric. The forces on ball and player are both explained by their nearness, which results in a pair of contact forces (ultimately due to electric repulsion). That this nearness is caused by a decision of the player has no bearing on the physical analysis. As far as the physics is concerned, the labels &#x27;action&#x27; and &#x27;reaction&#x27; can be flipped.

===&#x27;Equal and opposite&#x27;===
One problem frequently observed by physics educators is that students tend to apply Newton&#x27;s third law to pairs of &#x27;equal and opposite&#x27; forces acting on the same object.
This is incorrect; the third law refers to forces on two different objects. In contrast, a book lying on a table is subject to a downward gravitational force (exerted by the earth) and to an upward normal force by the table, both forces acting on the same book. Since the book is not accelerating, these forces must be exactly balanced, according to Newton&#x27;s second law. They are therefore &#x27;equal and opposite&#x27;, yet they are acting on the same object, hence they are not action-reaction forces in the sense of Newton&#x27;s third law. The actual action-reaction forces in the sense of Newton&#x27;s third law are the weight of the book (the attraction of the Earth on the book) and the book&#x27;s upward gravitational force on the earth. The book also pushes down on the table and the table pushes upwards on the book.
Moreover, the forces acting on the book are not always equally strong; they will be different if the book is pushed down by a third force, or if the table is slanted, or if the table-and-book system is in an accelerating elevator. The case of any number of forces acting on the same object is covered by considering the sum of all forces.

A possible cause of this problem is that the third law is often stated in an abbreviated form: &quot;For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,&quot; without the details, namely that these forces act on two different objects. Moreover, there is a causal connection between the weight of something and the normal force: if an object had no weight, it would not experience support force from the table, and the weight dictates how strong the support force will be. This causal relationship is not due to the third law but to other physical relations in the system.

===Centripetal and centrifugal force===
Another common mistake is to state that &quot;the centrifugal force that an object experiences is the reaction to the centripetal force on that object.&quot;

If an object were simultaneously subject to both a centripetal force and an equal and opposite centrifugal force, the resultant force would vanish and the object could not experience a circular motion. The centrifugal force is sometimes called a fictitious force or pseudo force, to underscore the fact that such a force only appears when calculations or measurements are conducted in non-inertial reference frames.

<text>In horse racing, the form of a horse is a record of significant events, mainly its performance in previous races. The form may identify the horse&#x27;s sire, dam and wider pedigree. It is used by tipsters and punters as an aid in the prediction of its performance in future races.

A typical way of showing a horse&#x27;s form, as published in newspapers and other media, is shown here.

 Number Colours Form Horse Name Age Weight Trainer Jockey 
 3 image 43-2F1 Mill Reef 3 11-12 A.Smith L.Piggott
 7 image 680U54 Glue Pot 3 11-10 B.Brown F.Dettori

Abbreviations used to decode the Form column can include:

Form is arranged chronologically from left (oldest) to right (newest).

So, in the example above, the horse Mill Reef gained a fourth place, followed by a third, then took some time out from racing, then gained a second followed by falling in the next race, and its latest result was a win.

The Model N diverged from its predecessors in that it was a front-engine car with a four-cylinder engine. The 15 hp straight-four drove the rear wheels via a long shaft. This was also the first American car to use vanadium steel. The car had a wheelbase of .

A successful model, 7000 cars were made before production ended in 1908. At , the car was viewed as highly affordable at the time; by contrast, the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout went for $650, Western&#x27;s Gale Model A was $500, the Brush Runabout $485, the Black $375, and the Success for $250. Maroon was the only factory color for the Model N.

==Model R==
The Model R was a higher trim level of the Model N with a larger body, wheels covered by full fenders, running boards, and oil lamps. Model R was $650, $150 above the $500 base Model N. The Model R was a 1907 model year offering, and 2500 were sold. Color was primarily dark green, with leather seats, brass fixtures, and a fuel tank holding . Other differences from the Model N included 30-inch tires, a rounded trunk, and a McCord mechanical oiler, rather than the Model N-style exhaust pressure oiler.

==Model S==
Two Model S styles were produced, a runabout and a roadster. The S runabout first appeared late in the 1907 model year, and was similar to the Model R, selling for $50 less than the R, at $700. Both models were sold for a short time before the R was discontinued for model/fiscal year 1908. The S roadster, like the R, had fenders attached to running boards, and a mechanical oiler. Differences from the R included Model N-style 28-inch tires and the pointed trunk.

The Model S Roadster was based on the same chassis as models N, R, and S runabout before it. Making its appearance during Ford fiscal/model year 1908, the S Roadster had an enclosed cowl, full fenders and fender aprons, and a third &quot;rumble&quot; seat. Like R and S runabouts, the SR used a McCord pressure oiler. Like Model R, the S Roadster was equipped with 30-inch tires. The S Roadster and Model K Roadster were the last models produced during the summer of 1908 as Ford retooled and prepared for the advent of the Model T. The S Roadster sold for $750. Extras such as a convertible top, gas lamps, and umbrella holders were available. 3,750 S Roadsters were sold between 1908 and 1909.

<text>The Republic of the Rif ( &quot;Jumhūriyyatu r-Rīf&quot;) was a confederate republic in the Rif, Morocco, that existed between 1921 and 1926. It was created in September 1921, when a coalition of Rifians and Jebala led by Abd el-Krim revolted in the Rif War against the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. The French would intervene on the side of Spain in the later stages of the conflict. A protracted struggle for independence killed many Rifians and Spanish–French soldiers, and witnessed the use of chemical weapons by the Spanish army—their first widespread deployment since the end of the World War I. The eventual Spanish–French victory was owed to the technological and manpower advantages despite their lack of morale and coherence. Following the war&#x27;s end, the Republic was ultimately dissolved in 1926.

==History==
=== Background ===

The French and Spanish empires both colonized Morocco, and in 1912 the Treaty Between France and Spain Regarding Morocco established Spanish and French protectorates there.

France&#x27;s general approach to governing the protectorate of Morocco was a policy of indirect rule, where they co-opted existing governance systems to control the protectorate. Specifically, the Moroccan elite and the sultans of Morocco were both left in control while being strongly influenced by the French government.

French and Spanish colonialism in Morocco was discriminatory against the native Rifians and Sahrawis and was highly detrimental to the Moroccan economy. Moroccans were treated as second-class citizens and discriminated against in all aspects of colonial life.

Infrastructure was discriminatory in colonial Morocco. The French colonial government built 36.5 kilometers of sewers in the new neighborhoods created to accommodate new French settlers, while only 4.3 kilometers of sewers were built in indigenous Moroccan communities. Additionally, land in Morocco was far more expensive for Moroccans than for French settlers. For example, while the average Moroccan had a plot of land 50 times smaller than their French settler counterparts, Moroccans were forced to pay 24% more per hectare. Moroccans were additionally prohibited from buying land from French settlers.

Colonial Morocco&#x27;s economy was designed to benefit French businesses at the detriment of Moroccan laborers. Morocco was forced to import all of its goods from France despite higher costs. Additionally, improvements to agriculture and irrigation systems in Morocco exclusively benefited colonial agriculturalists while leaving Moroccan farms at a technological disadvantage. It is estimated that French colonial policies resulted in 95% of Morocco&#x27;s trade deficit by 1950.

=== Rif War ===
Following the allowance of its interests and recognition of its influence in northern Morocco through the 1904 Entente Cordiale, 1906 Algeciras Conference and 1907 Pact of Cartagena, Restoration-era Spain occupied Ras Kebdana, a town near the Moulouya River, in March 1908 and launched the Melillan and Kert campaigns against the Riffian tribes between 1909 and 1912. In June 1911, Spanish troops occupied Larache and Ksar el-Kebir.

The Moroccan independence president Abd el-Krim (1882–1963) organized an armed revolution, the Rif War, against the Spanish and French colonial control of Morocco. The Spanish had faced unrest off and on from the 1890s, but in 1921 Spanish colonial troops were massacred at the Battle of Annual. Abd el-Krim founded an independent Republic, the Rif Republic, which operated until 1927 but had no formal international recognition.

France and Spain did not recognize the Republic and collaborated to destroy it. They sent in 200,000 soldiers, forcing Abd el-Krim to surrender in 1926. He was exiled in the Pacific until 1947. Morocco became quiet, and in 1936 became the base from which Francisco Franco launched the fascist coup of July 1936.

In 1921, local Rifians, under the leadership of Abd el-Krim, crushed a Spanish offensive led by General Manuel Fernández Silvestre at the Battle of Annual, and soon after declared the creation of an independent republic on 18 September 1921. The republic was formally constituted in 1923, with Abd el-Krim as head of state, and Ben Hajj Hatmi as prime minister.

Abd el-Krim handed the Spanish numerous defeats, driving them back to coastal outposts. With the war ongoing, he sent diplomatic representatives to London and Paris, in an ultimately futile attempt to establish legitimate diplomatic relations with other European powers.

In late 1925, the French and Spanish created a joint task force of 500,000 men, supported by tanks and aircraft. After 1923, the Spanish employed the use of chemical weapons imported from Germany. The Republic was dissolved by Spanish and French occupation forces on 27 May 1926, but many Rif guerrillas continued to fight until 1927. 

In April 1925, Abd el-Krim proclaimed the independent Republic in the Rif region of Spanish Morocco. He advanced south into French Morocco, defeating French forces and threatening the capital, Fes. The resident-general, Hubert Lyautey, was replaced as military commander by Philippe Pétain on 3 September 1925. On 11 October 1925, Théodore Steeg replaced Lyautey as resident-general with the mandate of restoring peace and making the transition from military to civilian government. Lyautey received very little recognition for his achievement in securing Morocco as a colony. Steeg would have been willing to give autonomy to the people of the Rif, but was overruled by the army.

Abd el-Krim surrendered to Philippe Pétain on 26 May 1926 and was deported to Réunion in the Indian Ocean, where he was held until 1947. Théodore Steeg said Abd el-Krim was a great leader and national and folk hero, but Abd el-Krim wanted &quot;neither [to be] exalted nor humiliated, but in time forgotten.&quot;

<text>Vlad IV Călugărul (&quot;Vlad IV the Monk&quot;; prior to 1425 – September 1495) was the Prince of Wallachia in 1481 and then from 1482 to 1495.

His father Vlad Dracul had previously held the throne, as had his brothers Mircea II and Radu the Handsome, and lastly Vlad III Dracula. The 15th century was a very volatile time in Wallachia, with the throne passing first from one then to another of the many princes that desired it. Both of his younger brothers, Vlad III and Radu, had been hostages for a number of years to the Ottoman Sultan, having been offered up to the Ottoman court by their own father, Vlad Dracul, in exchange for the Ottoman&#x27;s support of Vlad Dracul regaining his throne. His father had first gained the throne following the death of Vlad the Monk&#x27;s uncle.

Both his brothers Mircea II and Vlad III were able military commanders in the field, and both saw success in battle against the Ottomans. In 1447, his brother Mircea II and his father were both captured and brutally killed. Following this, Vlad III was placed on the throne by the Ottomans, but was forced off shortly thereafter by forces supported by John Hunyadi. This would begin a long quest by Vlad III to gain the throne, which he would do two more times. His longest time on the throne would be from 1456 to 1462, this being his reign of terror for which he would become best known, and which would lead to him being the inspiration for the novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, by Bram Stoker. His brother Radu gained the throne because he was the second in the line of succession, losing it several times to Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân. Radu died in January 1475, as the result of a long bout with syphilis, at which time Basarab naturally took the throne yet again, only to be forced off shortly thereafter in 1476 by Vlad III. Vlad III was killed in battle during December 1476, after which Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân was restored to the throne, only to be pushed off by Basarab Țepeluș cel Tânăr in November 1477.

Vlad the Monk was a contender to his brother&#x27;s throne as ruler of the principality of Wallachia for many years, but he took no active part in fighting for the throne until near the end of Vlad III&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1481, the same year Mehmed II died, conflict between his two surviving sons, Bayezid II and Cem, erupted into open conflict. Vlad was now placed on the throne by Ștefan III of Moldavia, who had invaded Wallachia that June and routed Basarab IV at Râmnicu Vâlcea. Soon enough Basarab IV was again Voivode of Wallachia, with Ottoman support. Ștefan made a last attempt to secure his influence in Wallachia, and within the year Basarab lost the throne again, after which he would reign until 1495. Although Vlad IV was restored, he was soon forced to accept the Sultan&#x27;s suzerainty.

In 1495, he helped build St. Nicholas Church, in Brașov, Transylvania. There is nothing historically that suggests his death that same year was anything other than natural. His fairly long reign by comparison to those before him was due in part to his having the support of Ștefan III of Moldavia. He was succeeded by his son, Radu cel Mare, who would reign until 1508, when he was ousted by his first cousin Mihnea cel Rău, son of Vlad the Impaler.

<text>Von (, &quot;Hope&quot;) is the debut studio album by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós, released on 14 June 1997 by Smekkleysa Records. Production lasted over two years, and the result sounded significantly different from the original recordings. The band considered scrapping the final result, but decided not as it would have made the process too long. In exchange for recording time, Sigur Rós painted the studio they recorded in.

&quot;Von&quot; was originally released in Iceland to positive reviews from critics, but went relatively unnoticed abroad. In the first year following its release, &quot;Von&quot; sold only 313 copies in Iceland. Following the band&#x27;s popular international releases &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot; and &quot;( )&quot;, it was re-released in the United Kingdom in 2004, and in the United States a month later. In 2005, &quot;Von&quot; and &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot; were declared platinum albums in Iceland, signifying domestic sales of over 5,000.

==Composition==
The sixth track consists of 18 seconds of silence, and gave name to Sigur Rós&#x27;s official website, &#x27;eighteen seconds before sunrise&#x27;. The last track starts with six minutes and fifteen seconds of silence, then consists of a portion of &quot;Myrkur&quot; played backwards, hence the name of &quot;Rukrym.&quot;

The tracks &quot;Hafssól&quot; and &quot;Von&quot; were later re-recorded with different arrangements, the former released as a B-side to the &quot;Hoppípolla&quot; single and both appearing on 2007&#x27;s &quot;Hvarf/Heim&quot;.

<text>Madge Blake (née Cummings; May 31, 1899 – February 19, 1969) was an American character actress best remembered for her role as Larry Mondello&#x27;s mother, Margaret Mondello, on the CBS/ABC sitcom &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, as Flora MacMichael on the ABC/CBS sitcom &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, and as Aunt Harriet Cooper in 96 episodes of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;. Gene Kelly had a special affection for her and included her in each of his films following her role in &quot;An American in Paris&quot;.

==Early life==
Blake and her husband James Lincoln Blake received a citation for some of their work from the U.S. government.

Blake was a first cousin of actor Milburn Stone (her mother and his father were sister and brother), who played the role of Doc Adams on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; Western series.

==Acting career==
She did not begin to study acting until she was 50 years old, when she enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse and took advantage of whatever influence or contacts Milburn Stone had to land acting roles.

Blake portrayed gushy gossip columnist Dora Bailey in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952). In the mid-1950s, she appeared on Rod Cameron&#x27;s &quot;City Detective&quot; and in Ray Milland&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Meet Mr. McNutley&quot;, renamed in the second season as &quot;The Ray Milland Show&quot;. Blake appeared in four episodes of the NBC sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot; (1954–1956) and twice on CBS&#x27;s &quot;December Bride&quot;, with Spring Byington. In 1958, she appeared in &quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot;, a Peabody Award-winning episode of the NBC anthology series &quot;Colgate Theatre&quot;. She also was a model for one of the fairies (Fauna) in Walt Disney&#x27;s animated version film &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959).

She appeared as Mrs. Porter, a babysitter, in the 1959 pilot of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;. About this time, she was cast in a guest-starring role in the sitcoms &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot;, with Joanne Dru on ABC, and &quot;Angel&quot;, with Annie Fargé on CBS.

Between 1957 and 1963, Blake had a recurring role as Flora MacMichael, the romantic interest of Walter Brennan&#x27;s Grandpa Amos McCoy on &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, a sitcom about a mountain family that relocated to Southern California. In 1960, she guest-starred in &quot;Tom Cuts Off the Credit&quot;, the premiere episode of the sitcom &quot;The Tom Ewell Show&quot;. The following year, she guest-starred in the episode &quot;A View of Murder&quot; of the syndicated crime drama &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot;.

Before her role on &quot;Batman&quot;, she had a recurring role on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; as the president of the Jack Benny Fan Club - Pasadena Chapter. She played Millie Brinkerhoff in the episode &quot;Instant Wedding&quot; in the 1963 NBC military drama &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; starring Gary Lockwood in the title role, and Larry Mondello&#x27;s mother on &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. Blake appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (broadcast in the U.S in September 1964) as Miss Comstock, an official from the Addams&#x27; children&#x27;s school. Blake also appeared in a memorable episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in 1957 with George Reeves guest-starring as Superman and in an earlier episode in 1954 as store clerk Mrs. Mulford. She played the mother of Joey Barnes on &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot; from 1961 to 1964. At one point, the producers of &quot;Batman&quot; wanted to fire Blake for unknown reasons. Adam West, with whom she had become friends, stood up for her and she kept her job. The next day, he found a freshly baked cake in his dressing room.

==Declining health and death==
Declining health caused Blake&#x27;s role as Aunt Harriet to be reduced, and with the introduction of Batgirl in the third and final season of &quot;Batman&quot;, she appeared in only two episodes that season in a guest role. Shortly before her death, she appeared as Mrs. Hardy in the episode &quot;The Con Man&quot; of the CBS sitcom &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;.

Blake was admitted to Huntington Memorial Hospital where she died at age 69, the result of a heart attack. She was interred beside her mother in the family plot at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery.

<text>A bougarabou (alternative spelling “Boucarabou”) is a set of drums commonly used in West Africa. The drums are single headed (cow skin), with an elongated goblet or roughly conical shape, usually placed on a single stand, and most commonly played in sets of three to four.

Until the last few decades the Bougarabou was played only one at a time, usually with one hand and a stick, but in the last generation or two (since the 1940s), possibly influenced from congueros in the western hemisphere, players play multiple drum setups. The drum is originally from the Jola (&quot;Jóola&quot;) people in the south of Senegal, the Casamance and the Gambia, the &quot;Jóola Buluf&quot;, the &quot;Jóola Fogny&quot; and the &quot;Jóola Kalunai&quot;.
The Jola call a single drum &quot;Búgarabu&quot; (the &quot;a&quot; is pronounced like in about) or &quot;Búgarab&quot;. As &quot;-ab&quot; or &quot;-abu&quot; represents the article, also &quot;Búgaar&quot;, the indefinite denotation, is used synonymously in everyday life whereas the Plural &quot;Wúgaraw&quot; is nearly not used.

The drumset is played by a single drummer, unlike many African tribal situations. The drummer also wears a series of metal bracelets called &quot;Siwangas&quot; in Buluf and Fogny dialect that contribute to the sound. The audience and the dancers form a circle and clap, often with wooden chunks (size 25–30 cm) of palm peduncles, and sing with the music, but it is unique in that a single drummer traditionally provides the drumming.
There are also some groups using a set of three or four drums and some more drums like djembe or other small Jola drums.

They are normally played with only the hands in a standing position. They have a full, deep, rich sound which can be heard for miles and is effective at all dynamic levels. They produce a kind of bass melody in the total rhythm. In other modern drumming situations, they are often used to back up djembes and tammas in a percussion group.

<text>The Albanian Fascist Militia (MFSH) (&quot;&quot;) was an Albanian fascist paramilitary group formed in 1939, following the Italian invasion of Albania. As a wing of the Italian Blackshirts (MVSN), the militia initially consisted of Italian colonists in Albania but later Albanian volunteers were also enlisted and made the majority of the group until it was disbanded in 1943. It was headquartered in Tirana.

==History==
The Albanian Fascist Militia (MFSH) dated 18.9.1939 was formed by Decree no. 91 of the deputy general and was part of the National Security Volunteer Militia headed by Commander General Mussolini. The militia was tasked with maintaining internal order at the request of the prime minister. Its recruitment was voluntary for all persons who met the requirements for membership of the Fascist Party. The officers were appointed by the General Command of the Voluntary National Security Militia, following the proposal of the Commander of the Albanian Fascist Militia (MFSH), after the Secretary of the Fascist Party was consulted. NCOs, graduates, black shirts were all appointed by the MFSH commander.
The MFSH consisted of one command, four legions and ten cohorts. It was fully funded by the state.

The militia was disbanded in 1943 following the surrender of Italy in World War II.

<doc id="1111609" wikidata="Q7010335" url="?curid=1111609" title="Local government in New Mexico">
<text>Local government in [[New Mexico]] consists of counties and municipalities.

== Counties ==
== Municipalities ==

A municipality may call itself a: village, town, or city. There is no distinction in the statutes and no correlation to any particular form (Mayor-Council, Commission-Manager, etc.).
Unless provided otherwise in a municipality&#x27;s charter, municipal elections are held on the first Tuesday in March of every even-numbered year. Elections are non-partisan, and election materials (cards, signs, ads, etc.) are exempted from the requirements for all other elections that the responsible party be identified (as in &quot;paid for by Committee to Elect Joe Candidate&quot;).

Municipalities are governed under Dillon&#x27;s rule, unless they elect to be governed by home rule. Currently, there are 10 home rule municipalities in New Mexico (Alamogordo, Albuquerque, Clovis, Gallup, Grants, Hobbs, Las Cruces, Los Alamos, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe), as well as two chartered cities (Las Vegas and Silver City).

== School districts ==
== Other bodies ==
In addition to municipalities, limited local authority can be vested in landowners&#x27; associations and districts. An example of the former is the Madrid Landowners&#x27; Association, which is the closest thing to local government in Madrid, New Mexico. Its authority comes from the restrictive covenants that are written into all deeds.

<text>Brianchon is a lunar impact crater that is located along the northwestern limb of the Moon. Due to its location, from the Earth the crater is seen from the edge and its visibility is somewhat affected by libration. Thus for a more detailed view, the crater must be viewed from orbit.

This crater lies just to the west of the crater Pascal, and Desargues is to the southeast. To the south of Brianchon along the limb is the crater Cremona, while Lindblad lies to the southwest just on the far side of the Moon.

Brianchon has been worn and eroded by a history of impacts that followed its creation. The most prominent of these are a pair of craters that lie across the northern rim, and Brianchon B which intrudes slightly into the southern rim. Brianchon A forms an outward bulge in the rim to the northwest, but otherwise merges seamlessly into the crater formation. There is also a concentric crater formation intruding into the exterion of the southeastern rim. The remainder of the outer wall has been rounded, and is covered in a number of tiny craterlets.

The floor of the crater is relatively level, and is marked by a multitude of tiny craterlets. The most prominent of these is a small, bowl-shaped crater just to the northwest of the midpoint. The southern portion of the crater floor in particular contains a grouping of several tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
These features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Brianchon.

<doc id="1111633" wikidata="Q1248041" url="?curid=1111633" title="Hypaspists">
<text>A hypaspist ( &quot;shield bearer&quot; or &quot;shield covered&quot;) is a squire, man at arms, or &quot;shield carrier&quot;. In Homer, Deiphobos advances &quot;&quot; () or under cover of his shield. By the time of Herodotus (426 BC), the word had come to mean a high status soldier as is strongly suggested by Herodotus in one of the earliest known uses:

A similar usage occurs in Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Rhesus&quot; and another in his &quot;Phoenissae&quot;. Xenophon was deserted by his hypaspist in a particularly sticky situation. A hypaspist would differ from a skeuophoros in most cases because the &quot;shield bearer&quot; is a free warrior and the &quot;baggage carrier&quot; was probably usually a slave.

The word may have had Homeric and heroic connotations that led Philip II of Macedon to use it for an elite military unit. This unit, known as the Hypaspistai, or hypaspists, was probably armed in the hoplite manner, with a large concave shield (Aspis) and a spear (Dory), in addition to spolas or linothorax body-armor, hoplite&#x27;s helmet, greaves and a xiphos or kopis sword (though their equipment was likely more ornate than main-line soldiers).

In contrast, the main Macedonian Phalanx consisted of the pikemen known as phalangites. These men were armed with the Sarissa, a pike of between 4 and 6.7m, a small flat shield and a shortsword called a Xiphos as a secondary weapon. The divergence in equipment and tactics between the traditional Greek Hoplite phalanx and the Macedonian Phalanx is attributed to Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great.

In set piece battles, the Macedonian Hypaspists were positioned on the flanks of the phalangite&#x27;s phalanx; in turn, their own flanks were protected by light infantry and cavalry. Their job was to guard the flanks of the large and unwieldy pike phalanx. The armored Phalangites with their sarissas were not particularly agile or able to turn quickly, so hypaspists would prevent attacks on the vulnerable sides of the formation. Their role was vital to the success of Philip&#x27;s tactics because the Macedonian phalanx was all but invulnerable from the front, and was, with five layers of iron spikes moving in unison, used as the anvil in a hammer and anvil tactic, where the Companion cavalry was the hammer that smashed the enemy against an anvil of thousands of iron spikes. As such an important yet vulnerable part of the Macedonian army, it needed protection for its main vulnerability, the flanks. The protection/remedy for this vulnerability was the Hypaspists, who were able to conduct maneuvers and use tactics, which, owing to their hoplite panoply of weapons and armor, would have been impossible (or at least much less effective) if performed by the phalangites.

All the references to a unit called &quot;Hypaspists&quot; are much later than the period of Philip, and modern historians have to assume that later sources, like Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC) and Arrian, had access to earlier records.

Arrian&#x27;s phrase ) has frequently been rendered as &#x27;lightest armed&#x27;, although Brunt concedes it is more properly translated as &#x27;nimblest&#x27; or &#x27;most agile&#x27;.

There has been a great deal of speculation by military historians ever since the late Hellenistic period about the elite units of Philip&#x27;s army. The hypaspists may have been raised from the whole kingdom rather than on a cantonal basis; if so, they were the king&#x27;s army rather than the army of the kingdom.

In the Hellenistic period, hypaspists apparently continued to exist, albeit in different capacities and under different names. The name lived on in the Seleucid, Ptolemaic and Antigonid kingdoms, yet they were now seen as royal bodyguards and military administrators. Polybius mentions a hypaspist being sent by Philip V of Macedon, after his defeat at the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC, to Larissa to burn state papers.

The actual fighting unit of hypaspists seems to have lived on in Macedonia as the corps of peltasts, whose status, equipment and role seems to have been almost exactly the same as that of the hypaspist under Philip. Originally consisting of 3,000 men, by the Third Macedonian War there were 5,000, most likely to accommodate their elite formation, the Agema.

Thomas was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales. He was orphaned at the age of 12, when his mariner father was lost at sea and his mother died only a few months later from cancer. He was subsequently brought up in a Dr Barnardo&#x27;s home; the story of this upbringing was the subject of his first, autobiographical, book, &quot;This Time Next Week&quot;.

Thomas attended Kingston Technical School and he then took a course in journalism at South-West Essex Technical College in Walthamstow. In 1949 he was called up for National Service and embarked on a two-year tour of duty in Singapore with the Royal Army Pay Corps. While there he was briefly involved with the military action against communist rebels in the Malayan emergency. He also began to write short articles for publication in English newspapers.

==Career==

Upon his return to England in 1951, Thomas resumed his work for the local newspaper group in north London where he had worked before his National Service, but within five years he was working for the Exchange Telegraph news agency, now Extel, and eventually with the &quot;London Evening News&quot; newspaper, first as a sub-editor, later as a reporter. He stayed with the &quot;Evening News&quot; until 1965, when he embarked full-time on his writing career.

In 1984, Thomas published &quot;In My Wildest Dreams&quot; recounting his childhood in South Wales, his days in Doctor Barnardo&#x27;s homes in London, his National Service in the Far East, and his career in journalism. His novels about 1950s British National Service such as &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot; spawned two film versions, in 1969 and 1977, while his &quot;Tropic of Ruislip&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Davies, The Last Detective&quot; have been adapted for television (the former as &quot;Tropic&quot; in 1979 and the latter having also spawned a film version, in 1981 and a TV series in 2003 with Peter Davison).

He was a subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1979 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at a Barnardo’s hostel in Kingston, Surrey.

His experiences as a British Army conscript in the Far East during the height of the Malayan emergency were recalled when he appeared in the BBC Radio 2 documentary &quot;Caught in the Draft&quot; in 1985. He joined ex-RAF national serviceman Bob Monkhouse and BBC Radio 2 drivetime presenter John Dunn in a programme filled with reminiscences about their years in uniform. He was also featured in the short-lived BBC One show &quot;Time of My Life&quot; in 1983. The show was presented by Noel Edmonds and Thomas was reunited with National Service colleague Reg Wilcock for the first time in 32 years. They duetted on &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot;, a song they used to sing frequently at the Liberty Club in Singapore.

Thomas was the subject of the first edition of BBC Wales&#x27; series &quot;Great Welsh Writers&quot;, broadcast on BBC One Wales on 25 February 2013. The programme featured interviews with Thomas, Peter Grosvenor, Frederick Forsyth and Tim Rice, as well as archive clips from earlier programmes.

==Honours==
In the 2005 New Year Honours, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to literature.

He died in Salisbury after a lengthy illness on 6 May 2014, aged 83.

<doc id="1111635" wikidata="Q3857906" url="?curid=1111635" title="Milizia Coloniale">
<text>The Milizia Coloniale was an all-volunteer colonial militia composed of members of the Fascist &quot;Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale&quot; (&quot;Volunteer Militia for National Security&quot;) or MVSN, commonly called the &quot;Blackshirts&quot;. It is considered unique in modern Italian military history, with its reputation matched only by the pre-unification paramilitary forces Redshirts.

The Milizia Coloniale was formed by Benito Mussolini in 1923. Its organization was based on the &quot;action squads&quot; he introduced in 1919 to counter communists and quash his enemies within the National Fascist Party. The militia organization had special branches that performed police functions covering infrastructure, postal services, and borders. For instance, there are Special Blackshirt units tasked with coastal defense. Based in Italian North Africa and Italian East Africa, the &quot;milizia coloniale&quot; recruited initially among Italian colonists, but later also among local Africans. By December 1931, the recruits reached 399,000.

The Milizia Coloniale saw action during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936 where 83 battalions were deployed. The colonial militia units involved in this campaign consisted seven legions (&quot;legioni&quot;):

* First Legion – Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
* Second Legion – Asmara, Eritrea
* Third Legion – Gondar, Ethiopia
* Fourth Legion – Massawa, Eritrea
* Fifth Legion – Mogadishu, Somaliland
* Sixth Legion – Jimma, Ethiopia
* Seventh Legion – Dessie, Ethiopia

Units from Italian East Africa were formed into the Africa Division, which was a light infantry division and was later destroyed in combat during the East African campaign. Forty six legions were also mobilized in World War II, with each legion serving under one Italian Army division. All remaining legions were destroyed during the Western Desert campaign during World War II.

<text>Sydney J. Van Scyoc (July 27, 1939 – June 17, 2023) was an American science fiction writer. Her first published story was &quot;Shatter the Wall&quot; in &quot;Galaxy&quot; in 1962. She continued to write short stories throughout the 1960s and in 1971, published her first novel, &quot;Saltflower&quot;. Other novels followed until 1992, when she abandoned writing to make and sell jewelry. Gordon Van Gelder, editor of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; published her first story in more than 20 years in the December 2004 issue. He stated in an introduction to the story that: &quot;in June 1992, after years of writing fiction, she became obsessed with jewelry making and spent a decade selling earrings and bracelets in the San Francisco Bay area. Last year she retired from that trade and now spends most of her time gardening and conferring with her cats...and, yes, writing again.&quot; Van Gelder would publish one more story in the December 2005 issue of his magazine and at that time stated in the introduction: &quot;Joyce Van Scyoc lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and spends all summer gardening until the October rains drive her inside.&quot;

According to book reviewer Dani Zweig, coming of age and human evolution are common themes in Van Scyoc&#x27;s books. In the novel &quot;Assignment Nor&#x27;Dyren&quot;, the two main characters are young humans off on an adventure visiting an alien world. Tollan Bailey has not been able to fit into the post-industrial work force of Earth, but the world Nor&#x27;Dyren provides an environment well suited to his interests. Laarica Johns is the other main human character, struggling to develop a career and escape from her over-protective parents. The theme of evolution is also present in &quot;Assignment Nor&#x27;Dyren&quot;, with questions raised about how human-like species must adapt to an environment that includes advanced technologies such as space travel.

<doc id="1111652" wikidata="Q624395" url="?curid=1111652" title="Distributed Universal Number Discovery">
<text>Distributed Universal Number Discovery (DUNDi) is a VoIP routing protocol that provides directory services for Asterisk systems.
With DUNDi peered nodes share dialplan information with each other. The protocol does not actually carry any calls, but rather provides addressing information.

Peers in a DUNDi cluster query other peers for a telephone number to which a call is requested by a user. The result of the query is a dial string for the Asterisk application &quot;Dial&quot;.

The protocol was invented by Mark Spencer, the author of Asterisk.

==Peers==
Asterisk PBX systems that use DUNDi are peered as a cooperating system of DUNDi nodes, each having certain configuration to access a DUNDI instance on at least one other node.

In the DUNDi configuration one can limit the number of consecutive lookups between peers by setting the TTL.
* A TTL of 1 means you only can ask the peers you know and they cannot ask further.
* A TTL of n means that the peer you ask for a lookup can redirect your lookup to the peers it knows, only with a TTL of n-1.

== Advertising extensions ==
Each DUNDi peer can advertise its own extensions and their context. E.g. if you can connect some local E.164 number(s), you can advertise these.

DUNDi configuration assigns a priority weight to each advertised extension. 
Low values represent a high priority and must be chosen first when more than one answer is received from a lookup.

== Example==
In the Asterisk CLI one can do a lookup by hand to test if a DUNDi configuration works.
 asterisk1*CLI&gt; dundi lookup 301@priv bypass
 1. 0 IAX2/priv:ByWFbOGKgGmZbM43BJHSZw@192.168.1.2/301 (EXISTS)
 from 00:0c:29:d2:d8:ec, expires in 3600 s
 DUNDi lookup completed in 113 ms
The above DUNDi lookup tells the PBX to ask the known peers if they know how to reach extension 301 in the &quot;priv&quot; network.
The answer consists of 6 parts:
* The used protocol to communicate is IAX2.
* The context-name is &quot;priv&quot;.
* The secret key of the PBX, which can redirect you to extension 301 is ByW[...]HSZw (this changes periodically)
* The address of this PBX is 192.168.1.2 (or some domainname, should be reachable by the calling party)
* The extension to call is 301 (this can be different from what you asked for, e.g. when calls from the outside are not allowed directly to an internal extension)
* &quot;EXISTS&quot; tells us the PBX is advertising this number. It is possible the PBX advertises a lot more extensions than really are connected, so it is no guarantee the extension can be reached.

In order to prevent the network from overloading and at the same time keep the responses as quick as possible, the involved peers will cache the lookups they see. Because the used keys may become invalid after some period, each lookup has some expiry date. This defaults to one hour.

When no context is given with a lookup, DUNDi defaults to the E.164 context. This means you are looking for normal (international) phone-numbers, like 0031201234567 (some bogus number in Amsterdam, the Netherlands)
In order to do so, you have to peer with at least one other peer in the &quot;E164 trust group&quot;. The peers in this group are bound to the Digium GPA (Digium General Peering Agreement) (PDF)

<text>The Wigham Richardson shipbuilding company was named after its founder, John Wigham Richardson (1837-1908), the son of Edward Richardson, a tanner from Newcastle upon Tyne, and Jane Wigham from Edinburgh.

==History==
The Company was set up with less than £5,000, given to Richardson by his father in 1860. This was enough for him to found the Neptune Shipyard at Wallsend.

Its first ship, a paddle steamer called &quot;Victoria&quot;, was launched on the River Tyne that summer. She was commissioned to carry passengers, carts and livestock between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, and is thought to have cost around £700.

At least part of Wigham Richardson&#x27;s success in the latter part of the 19th century was through the surge in demand for passenger ships, taking emigrants to the New World.

In 1903, Wigham Richardson merged with Swan and Hunter specifically to bid for the prestigious contract to build the . Their bid was successful, and she went on to capture the Blue Riband for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic - a record she held for two decades. Even today, she is the largest liner ever built on the Tyne.

The company flourished, and between 1906 and 1912, no other company in the world could match it in terms of the tonnage of shipping produced. In 1907, for example, 15% of the world&#x27;s shipping, in tonnage terms, was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson.

<text>Carharrack () is a civil parish and village in west Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated two miles (3 km) east of Redruth in a former mining area.

The parish is of a rural/residential character, albeit with an industrial (mostly mining) past and relics of the past abound, primarily in the form of abandoned and broken down engine house buildings. The parish is comparatively small in area, and is bounded to the north and northwest by St Day parish, to the east and southeast by Gwennap parish, and to the southwest and west by Lanner parish.

Until 1985, Carharrack was part of the parish of Gwennap but it became a civil parish in its own right with the first meeting of Carharrack Parish Council on 28 May 1985.

==Toponymy==
The derivation of the modern form of the name &quot;Carharrack&quot; is uncertain. Craig Wetherhill suggests it is a corruption of the Cornish &quot;ker/cayr Ardhek&quot; meaning Arthroc&#x27;s fort. Eric Rabjohns, a locally based local-historian, while acknowledging this possibility, also advances another two contenders. The first is that the name refers to a dwelling of religious purpose, a meeting place for travellers, originating from Carharrack&#x27;s proximity to the pilgrimage trail between Canterbury and St Michael&#x27;s Mount, which is known to have passed through the nearby villages of St Day to the north and Lanner to the south. The final option, again based on a corruption of the Cornish, this time of &quot;Car&quot; (or &quot;Caer&quot;) &quot;Harrack&quot; meaning a camp, enclosure, or settlement near the rock or Carn, presumably referring to the mass of Carn Marth whose granite bulk overshadows the village. Each derivative has a degree of evidence to support it.

==History==
Earliest references to the area appear around 1290, but references to dwellings on the current site only date from the 1700s. Boom years for the village were in the first half of the nineteenth century, with the expansion of the local mines which at peak employed several thousand people: Carharrack was the closest settlement and provided plenty of space for building. By the 1860s the copper industry in Cornwall was in decline and many residents emigrated in search of work.

A Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was opened in 1815. The grade II* listed building was altered in the late 19th and early 20th-century and is now a Methodist church. Carharrack church was opened on 20 February 1884 by Canon Phillpotts of Porthgwidden. It was built by Messrs Williams and Moyle for £600 and holds nearly 200 people. The eastern window is a memorial to Miss Rogers of Trevarthian.

During the latter part of the twentieth century the village suffered a progressive loss both of local employment and local facilities and although there have been various new housing developments around the village it now functions more as a dormitory village.

==Mining==

Carharrack is within the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, a World Heritage Site; it is in the Redruth Mining District of the designated area. The site of the Consolidated Mines, formed in 1782 by the amalgamation of Carharrack Mine and several other local tin and copper mines, is immediately east of the village. The mines were served by the Redruth and Chasewater Railway (an early narrow gauge line) which connected them to quays at Devoran on Cornwall&#x27;s south coast. The railway closed in 1915 and its course is now a long-distance footpath and cycleway, one of Cornwall&#x27;s Mineral Tramway Trails.

Carharrack is the type locality for the copper-arsenate mineral Olivenite, a crystalline lustrous rock which often has a green or olive hue.

==Culture and sport==
Local electronic musician Aphex Twin made a remix of his own track &quot;Ventolin&quot; titled &quot;Ventolin (Carharrack Mix)&quot;. The remix was first released on &quot;Ventolin Remixes&quot; in 1995 and was later included on the 1996 compilation &quot;51/13 Aphex Singles Collection&quot;. The village also has a brass band Carharrack and St Day which notably play for the St Day feast dances.

The village has a football team, Carharrack AFC, which play in the Cornwall Combination League. They were champions in season 2016–17.

===Cornish wrestling===
There have been Cornish wrestling tournaments held in Carharrack in a field adjoining the Steam Engine Inn.

<text>The typographer was an early typewriter invented by William Austin Burt. Intended to aid in office work, the machine worked by using a lever to press characters onto paper one at a time. It was the first typewriting machine to be patented in the United States, although Pellegrino Turri had made one in Italy in 1808. Perhaps because of its slow speed, or because there was not yet a wide market for typewriters, it was not a commercial success.

The working model that Burt constructed for his 1829 patent was destroyed in the 1836 Patent Office fire.

<text>Kirkwood is a well-formed lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, on the northern hemisphere, approximately 68 kilometers in diameter. It lies just to the northeast of the crater Sommerfeld, and Hippocrates is located to the east-northeast. It was named after American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood.

== Description ==

The perimeter of this crater is generally circular, with a few slight outward notches particularly to the southeast. It displays very little appearance of wear, and neither the interior nor the outer are marked by any craters of note.

The inner wall has slumped somewhat, and has formed a few -like structures. The interior ejecta spreads a good way across the inner floor, covering nearly half the diameter. At the midpoint appear several small hills producing a central peak formation.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kirkwood.

<doc id="1111682" wikidata="Q5917984" url="?curid=1111682" title="How May I Help You?">
<text>How May I Help You? is the second EP released by progressive metal act Sikth. The EP features the title track, Suffice and an experimental cover of Nick Cave&#x27;s &quot;Tupelo&quot;.

==Background==

===How May I Help You?===
&quot;A chapter of a fictional story... I have wanted to create something like this and really bring it to life for so long now - something that enables me to introduce a variety of characters which I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to work with.
This particular chapter focusses on a boy called Rodney, who&#x27;s starting to grow up. He&#x27;s the kind of person who can&#x27;t seem to let his emotions out. He&#x27;s always getting picked on and pushed around, which really winds him up. But even then he just can&#x27;t give vent to his feelings. When he finally gets a girlfriend, it seems as though none of that really matters any more - he starts to feel happy for the very first time. But then it all goes horribly wrong, which is too much for him and he flips out. His anger has at last been unleashed, but it&#x27;s done him no favours at all...&quot; Mikee Goodman.

The song was made into an animated video, which was written, directed and produced by Mikee Goodman, one of the band&#x27;s vocalists. The video won the best video award in &quot;The Big Cheese Magazine&quot;, as well as reaching number 1 on MTV UK and being an A-list video on MTV Asia.

===Suffice===
&quot;The first ever SikTh song, revamped here from its original incarnation. A piece of SikTh history. The idea was to get across a positive message. It starts at a point where everything is going well and you&#x27;re feeling good about life. then everything seems to go wrong all at once - thoughts of escape go through your mind, a thousand negative thoughts spin around your head, then a strong positive voice inside makes itself heard, hoping for a better tomorrow, however bad today may be...&quot; Mikee Goodman.

<doc id="1111684" wikidata="Q1827463" url="?curid=1111684" title="Mar Thoma Syrian Church">
<text>The Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church, often shortened to Mar Thoma Church, and known also as the Reformed Syrian Church and the Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar, is an autonomous Oriental Protestant Christian church based in Kerala, India. While continuing many of the Syriac high church practices, the church is Protestant in its theology and doctrines. It employs a reformed variant of the West Syriac Rite Divine Liturgy of Saint James, translated to Malayalam.

The Mar Thoma Church sees itself as continuation of the Saint Thomas Christians, a community traditionally believed to have been founded in the first century by Thomas the Apostle, who is known as Mar Thoma (&quot;Saint Thomas&quot;) in Syriac, and describes itself as &quot;Apostolic in origin, Universal in nature, Biblical in faith, Evangelical in principle, Ecumenical in outlook, Oriental in worship, Democratic in function, and Episcopal in character&quot;.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, Mar Thoma Christians lived in a few districts of Central Travancore (Pathanamthitta, Kollam, and Thiruvananthapuram districts) and Kunnamkulam (Thrissur district) in Kerala. Since that time they have spread with the 20th-century Indian diaspora to North America, Europe, the Middle East, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. According to the figures provided by the church itself, it currently has over 1 million members. Their mother tongue is Malayalam, the language of Kerala, and historically the variety known as Suriyani Malayalam was associated with them.

According to the 2011 Census of Kerala it was, with a membership of 405,089, the sixth largest Christian church in the state, coming after the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church (2,345,911), the Latin Catholic Church (932,733), the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (493,858), the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church (482,762), and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church (465,207).

== Definitions ==
Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church is commonly called the &quot;Mar Thoma Church&quot;. In official and legal records the church is referred to as Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar or as Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church. &quot;Malabar&quot; is a term used to denote the Kerala coast in earlier days. The original Church was referred to as the Church of Malabar by the Jesuits and as the Syrian Church of Malabar in Missionary Registers from 1801 onward. &quot;Malankara&quot; is an ancient name derived from the name &#x27;Maliankara&#x27;, Maliankara Island is on the Southwestern side of the Indian Peninsula. It is between Gokarnam and Kanyakumari the southernmost point of India. Kerala, the present southwestern state of India is only a part of Malankara. It is also thought to be a cognate of this name Maliankara, a place near Muziris, where Thomas the Apostle first landed in Kerala.

&quot;Mar Thoma&quot; is Aramaic, and means Saint Thomas. Members of the Mar Thoma Syrian Church are commonly called as Mar Thomiyar, Mar Thomites, or Mar Thoma Syrians. The original liturgical language used by Saint Thomas Christians was the East Syriac language which is a variant of Aramaic. The Reformation movement in the Malankara Syrian Church later resulted in the evolution of an independent indigenous Malankara church under the Mathoma Metropolitan, breaking all the ecclesiastical and temporal control from outside Malankara. In 1898, during the reign of Titus I Mar Thoma the church accepted as its name, &quot;Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church&quot; or &quot;Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar&quot; to comprise its order and heritage. The members of this church are known as Mar Thoma Nasrani or Mar Thoma Syrian Nasrani.

== Administration ==
The Mar Thoma Syrian Church has a well-defined constitution and has a democratic pattern of administration. The central administrative setup consists of the Metropolitan, the Episcopal Synod (&quot;Consisting of all the Bishops of the Church&quot;), the Prathinithi Mandalam (&quot;House of Representatives&quot;) and the Sabha Council (&quot;Executive body of the house of representatives / Mandalam&quot;), and the Vaideeka Selection Committee (&quot;to select candidates for the ordained ministry of the church&quot;).

The Central Administration of the Church is backed by the Dioceses. Each diocese has its own council and an assembly. The assembly members are elected by the individual parishes, and the diocesan council members are elected by the assembly.

All members of a parish are members of the Edavaka Sangham (General Body) and they also have the right to elect their representatives to the Diocesan Assembly and Prathinidhi Mandalam (Church Parliament).

The title of the head of the Church is &quot;Mar Thoma Metropolitan&quot;. He is ordained from among the duly-consecrated bishops (Episcopas) of the Church, the choice being ordinarily that of the senior-most among them. The present Mar Thoma Metropolitan is Theodosius Mar Thoma who resides at Poolatheen at Church Headquarters in Tiruvalla, Kerala. He is 21 Mar Thoma in the line of continuation after the re-establishment of the Mar Thoma episcopacy after the Oath of the Koonan Cross (1653).

If the Metropolitan is personally satisfied that he has difficulty continuing to perform the duties pertaining to his office, he may relinquish the powers and responsibilities of Metropolitan. Then he becomes the Mar Thoma Metropolitan Emeritus and is addressed as &quot;Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan&quot;. The present &quot;Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan is Philipose Chrysostom Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan.

To assist the metropolitan there are &quot;Episcopas&quot;, the senior-most among them is called the Suffragan Metropolitan.

=== Administrative divisions ===
For administrative purposes, the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church is divided into 13 dioceses or popularly called &#x27;Bhadhrasanams&#x27; () headed by a Metropolitan or by an Episcopa.
They are:
== Metropolitans and bishops ==
=== Present episcopal synod ===
The present members of the Episcopal Synod of Mar Thoma Church are:
*Theodosius Mar Thoma
*Euyakim Coorilos
*Joseph Barnabas
*Thomas Timotheos
*Isaac Philoxenos
*Abraham Paulos
*Mathews Makarios
*Gregorios Stephanos
*Thomas Theethos

=== Mar Thoma Metropolitans ===
The excommunication of Reformist bishops and their followers by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch in 1875, the Synod of 1876 (Mulanthuruthy) and the Royal Court Verdict of 1889 were turning points in the history of the Malankara Syrian Church of Malabar. The Reformist (Metran) faction continued to consecrate bishops to the Malankara See without the consent of Patriarch as they claimed Malankara church is independent of the Syrian Church. Before the death of Malankara Metropolitan Mathews Athanasius, he consecrated Thomas Athanasius as Suffragan bishop of Malankara Church. Following the death of Mathews Athanasius, the suffragan succeeded as the Metropolitan of the Malankara See in 1877 which led to a schism in the Malankara church. Those who supported reformation loyally followed the Malankara Metropolitan who was legally evicted from the Malankara Syrian Church. He died in 1893 without consecrating a successor and suggesting a new name for the church. The Metropolitan of Malabar Independent Syrian Church stepped in and consecrated Titus Mar Thoma as the new bishop.

For the consecrations, from 1917 onward bishops from other churches were invited as guests. But the consecration was done only by the Metropolitan and was assisted as a witness by the other Bishops of the Mar Thoma Church and of the Malabar Independent Syrian Church.

=== Clergy ===
&quot;Semmasan&quot; (deacons):
The Sabha Prathinidhi Mandalam elects a Vaidika Selection board to select candidates for the ordained ministry of the church through recommendations (letters from bishops-clergy by the level of exposure in church or by personal sponsorships of bishops or written support pledged from bishops), exams (English, General knowledge and Bible) and pre- and post- theological training interviews (with theological-sociological aspects and scrutiny through psychological and health evaluations).

Following a Malankara Church tradition and from diasporic influence, the church follows a compulsory twelve-month (or 24 months with relocation, if failed in the first attempt) unpaid missionary service to those who are inclined to be a priest, before selection process as a &quot;Tithe of Youth&quot; program for &quot;evaluation purposes&quot;. Additionally, this program was challenged in youth meets of the church at the time of its conception on the basis of non-guarantee in an entry, fast-changing world, career stagnation, and other economic factors and have arrived at a discussion level resolution of implementing this process after the pursual of their theological training and integrating the &quot;Deacon&quot; status during the time period under mentorship which enables the church to fill up NGO&#x27;s, projects and mission fields with trained and theologically equipped individuals for staff duties and pastoring, thus avoid stress and negligence that would be otherwise imparted on the youth. During the intensive field training, when the inclined candidate is counted to be worthy for the controlled influx in church duties, the trained and experienced Deacons can be nominated for ordinations as Kassessas, by each diocese as the allotment.

&quot;Kassessa&quot; (clergy priests):
Persons receiving ordination as ministers shall be duly ordained deacons. They all have had their Bachelor of Divinity degree from the Mar Thoma Theological Seminary, Kottayam, Kerala, or from other recognized theological seminaries of India. The wife of a Kassissa is known as &quot;Baskiamma&quot; derived from&quot; Baskiyomo in Syriac.

Vicars general:
From among the clergy who have completed 25 years of service in the ordained ministry and not less than sixty years of age are selected according to their contributions and ordained as vicars general. In the absence of the diocesan bishop, they may be appointed as deputy head of the bishopric.

== History ==
Thomas Christians are popularly and traditionally called as &quot;Syrian Christians&quot;, in view of the Syriac liturgy (a variant of the classical form of Aramaic) used in church services since the early days of Christianity in India.

The Saint Thomas Christians remained as Church of Malabar with fraternity relationship with Church of East, Church of Antioch, Church of Alexandria, etc. till the Advent of Portuguese and Jesuits of Roman Catholic church in the 15th century. Thereafter, the Christians of St Thomas had been influenced by many belief streams at different points of time. These influences have later resulted in serious rifts and in the breaking down of the monolithic apostolic church to different fragments under different faith streams. They were organised as a Church in the 8th century, served by foreign bishops, and with a hereditary local chief called Archdeacon &quot;(Arkadiyokon)&quot;. In the 16th century the overtures of the Portuguese &quot;padroado&quot; to bring the Saint Thomas Christians into the Latin Church of the Catholic Church led to the first of several rifts in the community and the establishment of &quot;Pazhayakoor&quot; (Catholic) and &quot;Puthenkoor&quot; factions. Since that time further splits have occurred, and the Saint Thomas Christians are now divided into several denominations, each with their own liturgies and traditions.
=== First century BC ===

On the southwestern side of the Indian peninsula; between the mountains and the Erythraean Sea (now the Arabian Sea); stretching from Kannur to Kanyakumari was the land called Cherarajyam, which was ruled by local chieftains. Later this land came to be known as the Malabar region and (now Kerala). Muziris (near Kochi) was the important entry port. After the discovery of Hippalus, every year 100 ships arrived here from various parts of the then known world, including Red Sea ports.

According to the Bible, during the time of Moses and Solomon, the Malabar Coast traded spices and luxury articles with Israel (I Kings 9:26–28, 10:11, 22; 2 Chronicles 8:18, 9:21).

Excavations carried out at Pattanam (near Kochi) from 2005 provided evidence that the maritime trade between Kerala and the Mediterranean ports existed even before 500 BC or earlier. It is possible that some of those traders who arrived from the west, including Jews, remained in Kerala.

While Augustus (31 BC- 14 AD) was the Roman emperor and Herod the Great (37–4 BC) was King of Judea, ambassadors from Malabar visited the Emperor according to an account of Nicolaus of Damascus. Certain nasrani writings hypothesize that these ambassadors were the Biblical Magi of Matthew 2:1, as a tradition.

=== First 15 centuries ===

==== Arrival of Saint Thomas ====
Saint Thomas Christians believe that Thomas the Apostle arrived in the Malabar Coast around AD 52. He landed at Muziris (now estimated as Pattanam, near Kochi on the Malabar Coast), after his first mission in the Parthian empire, during the era of King Gondophares It is believed that St. Thomas itinerated for 30 years in Kerala and proceeded to the East coast of India from Malankara and died a martyrs&#x27; death at a place called Mylapore-Chinnamalai in Tamil Nadu.

The Nazarenes in Malabar were either proselytized from mainstream Judaism by &#x27;Mar Thomas&#x27; or &#x27;Mar Bartholomeu&#x27;. Pantaneius&#x27;s reference to the gift of &#x27;Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew&#x27; by Bartholomeu to the Nazereans in Malabar is a clear pointer to the fact that Mar Thomas did evangelize Malabar, It could be further stated that either Mar Nathanael () aided in Mar Thomas&#x27; mission in India for a brief time before heading to Armenia or bar-Tau&#x27;ma, Son of Thomas assisted in his father&#x27;s missionary activities per norms in , this could also explain why most of the priests in the order of St. Thomas were later allowed to be married, which led to the prerogative of sacerdotalism to certain groups/families and to people supported by them.

==== First Christians ====
In early Christian times, &#x27;Nazranis&#x27; was not a separate religion, but a sect in the Jewish community. The term was used to denote followers of Jesus of Nazareth. (Acts. 24:5; 28:22). &#x27;Khristianos&#x27; (or Christians) was initially used largely to refer non-Jewish people who followed Christ (Acts 11:26). In Kerala, the sect was known as &#x27;Nazraani Margam&#x27;. Margam in Malayalam means, &#x27;The Way&#x27;. (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22). Thus, the word Nazraani clearly shows that many who joined them were Jews. But in Kerala, this name was replaced by the word &#x27;Christians&#x27; in the 20th century.

The earliest families within the Jewish community to accept the path of Christianity through St. Thomas, later intermarried with the ethnic local community and Brahmins of the 6th century. This led to the upbringing of marginal class or &#x27;sambandham&#x27; Brahminic family clans like Pakalomattom, Sankarapuri and Kalli to a different socioeconomic status, they are now widely accepted as the first families who adopted an emigre way of life or &#x27;Christianity&#x27; in Kerala. According to recent DNA research by Dr. Mini Kariappa, a significant number of Knanaya&#x27;s share their ancestral roots with the West Eurasian gene pool of Jews.

==== Administration ====
Saint Thomas Christians were administratively under the single native dynastic leadership of Arkadyaqon (East Syrian term for an ecclesiastical head with extensive administrative powers, deriving from Greek αρχιδιάκονος = archdeacon) commonly referred as &quot;Jathikku Karthavyan&quot; ( Malayalam term meaning &quot;Leader of The Community&quot;). The Malankara Church believes that St. Thomas appointed elders at every place he preached to lead the believers. He prayed and laid his hands upon them, in the same way as the other disciples did (Book of Acts 6:1–6; 8:14–17; 13: 1–3). This was the system used until the arrival of Portuguese. By 1500, Malankara Church had Parish elders and a Church leader. Before the arrival of Portuguese, Latin was unknown to Malankara people. In the ‘&#x27;Decrees of The Synod of Udayamperoor&#x27;’ presented to the St. Thomas Christians in their mother tongue Malayalam, Malankara Mooppen was the name used to refer the Church leader, except on three occasions. During the period of Colonialism, (i.e., from the 16th century), the Portuguese Jesuits began deliberate attempts to annex the community into the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, and in 1599 AD, they succeeded in their attempt through the infamous Synod of Diamper. Resentment against these forceful measures led the majority of the community under their Arkadyaqon Thomas to swear an oath never to submit to the Portuguese, known as the Coonan Cross Oath in 1653. For the first time in 1653, the Church leader was given the title Mar Thoma when Thomas Arkadyaqon was consecrated as Mar Thoma I. The present head of the Mar Thoma Church is the twenty-first Mar Thoma.

==== Pantaenus from Alexandria ====
In the 2nd century (189-190 AD) AD, Pantaenus, the Philosopher and Missionary sent by Bishop Demetrius of Alexandria to India, found that there were many Christians in India with a Persian Bishop and that they had a copy of the Gospel according to Matthew in Aramaic. These Christians were the early evangelists of Malankara Church.

==== Arrival of Knanaya Nazranis ====
During the time of King Shapur II (310–379) of Persia, a group of 400 immigrants (72 families) from Persia arrived in Malabar under the leadership of merchant Knai Thomman. They were engaged in trade and settled down in Kodungallur. Another immigration from Persia occurred around 825 under the leadership of Persian merchant Marwan Sabriso, with two Bishops, Sapro and Prodh. Together they were known as Knanaya/Kanai people. They continued to remain partially in an endogamous group within the Nasrani community. They cooperated with the Malankara Church, attended worship services together but remained a separate identity. By the 10th century, in Malabar there were two Nazrani groups, the Saint Thomas Christians and Knanaya community.

==== Bishops from Persia ====
Following the arrival of Christians from Persia, their bishops, priests or laymen began visiting them. Most of them were not able to return due to financial difficulties and travelling long distances. The Knanaya people were worshipping together with the St. Thomas Christians. So these visitors also attended these services. It was a matter of ongoing dispute between different churches in Kerala whether the Syrian bishops had any administrative responsibility or jurisdiction over the St. Thomas Nazrani Christians.

==== Persian crosses ====

Persian crosses were in churches once attended by Nasranis. Out of five Persian crosses, two are in Kottayam Knanaya Valia Palli. According to the archaeologists, the earliest one was made in the 7th century. The cross became a symbol of Christianity in the west, during the time of Constantine (272–337). Saint Thomas Christians of Malabar had hardly any contact with other Christians before the arrival of Knanaya people from Persia. Moreover, two of the oldest church buildings that still exist in South India do not have any marking of a Cross on their original structure. So most probably it was during the 7th century that the cross became a symbol of St. Thomas Christians.

==== Visits corroborating the existence of the Malankara Church ====
The existence of this Church in the early centuries is evident in the writings of ancient travelers.

* 325 AD – It is recorded that there was a Syro-Chaldean bishop John &quot;from India and Persia&quot; who assisted at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD.
* 522 AD – an Egyptian Monk, Cosmas Indicopleustes in his writings, ‘&#x27;Universal Christian Topography&#x27;’ mentions that there was this Church with a bishop from Persia.
* 883 AD – Alfred the Great (849–899), King of Wessex, England reportedly sent gifts &quot;in India to St. Thomas and to St. Bartholomew&quot;, through Sighelm, bishop of Sherborne.
* 1225 AD – Chau Ju-Kua a Chinese traveller visited Kerala.
* 1282 AD – Kublai Khan (1215–1294) Emperor of China sent an emissary to Kollam, It was followed by an emissary from Kollam under the leadership of a St. Thomas Christian.
* 1292 AD – Marco Polo (1254–1324) on his return journey from China visited Kerala, mentions that &quot;The people are idolaters, though there are some Christians and Jews among them&quot;.

==== Collection of deeds ====
The rulers of Kerala, in appreciation of their assistance, had given to the Malankara Nazranis, three deeds on copper plates. These are known as Cheppeds, Royal Grants, Sasanam etc. Five sheets of them are now in the custody of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church Headquarters at Thiruvalla.

#Iravi Corttan Deed: In the year 774 AD. Sri Vira Raghava Chakravarti, gave a deed to Iravi Corttan of Mahadevarpattanam.
#Tharissa palli Deed I: Perumal Sthanu Ravi Gupta (844–885) gave a deed in 849 AD, to Isodatta Virai for Tharissa Palli (church) at Curakkeni Kollam. According to historians, this is the first deed in Kerala that gives the exact date.
#Tharissa palli Deed II: A continuation of the above deed was given sometime after 849 AD.

=== Portuguese period ===
The Portuguese started settling in India with the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498. For the next 200 years, they took control over the sea routes and were powerful in the western parts of India. By 1500, Malankara Church was spread from Kannur in the North to Kollam in the South. It included the Saint Thomas Christians and the endogamous group, Knanaya Christians. The Saint Thomas Christians went through changes with the encounter of Portuguese in 1599. In the 16th century the overtures of the Portuguese &quot;padroado&quot; to initiate the Saint Thomas Christians into the Catholic Church led to the first of several rifts in the community and the establishment of Pazhayakoor and Puthenkoor factions. Since that time further splits have occurred.

==== Synod of Diamper ====
The Malankara Church had hardly any contact with the Western Church. The Portuguese used their power to bring the Malankara Church under Latin jurisdiction. A powerful Archbishop Aleixo de Menezes arrived in Goa in 1595. He then convened a Synod at Udayamperoor, south of Ernakulam, from 20 to 26 June 1599, known as the Synod of Diamper. Here the Archbishop demanded complete submission to the Latin jurisdiction. The representatives sent from various parishes in and around Cochin were forced to accept the decrees read out by the Archbishop.

==== Divisions among Saint Thomas Christians ====

A protest took place in 1653 with the Coonan Cross Oath. Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas (Mar Thoma I), the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath that they wouldn&#x27;t obey the Jesuit bishops.

Rome sent Carmelites in two groups from the Propagation of the Faith to Malabar headed by Fr. Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655. He began to deal directly with the Archdeacon Thomas (Mar Thoma I). Fr. Sebastiani gained the support of many, especially with the support of Palliveettil Chandy, Alexandar Kadavil and the Vicar of Muttam. These were the three councilors of Mar Thoma I, who was reconciled with Gracia (SJ) before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.

The Pazhayakūr Catholic faction persistently challenged the validity of the ordination of Mar Thoma I by laying hands of 12 priests. It led many people to believe what they said and chose to rejoin with the catholic faction.

Between 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites reclaimed eighty-four churches, leaving Archdeacon Mar Thomas I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Church and the Chaldean Syrian Church have descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites &amp; Orthodox), Thozhiyur, Mar Thoma (Reformed Syrians), Syro Malankara Catholics have originated.

In 1665 with the request of the Archdeacon, Gregorios Abdul Jaleel a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, arrived in India. A faithful group under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him. The arrival of the Bishop Gregory of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syrian theological and liturgical tradition of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch of Gregory became known as the Jacobite, while the Syrian Catholics remained in communion with Rome and later came to be known as the Syro Malabar Church.

==== Oath of the Bent Cross ====
Under the leadership of their elder Thomas, Nazranis around Cochin gathered at Mattancherry church on Friday, 24 January 1653 (M.E. 828 Makaram 3) and made an oath that is known as the Great Oath of Bent Cross.

::&quot;Thomas Whitehouse, an Anglican Protestant missionary quotes from the &quot;Church Missionary Society Report for 1818–19&quot;, p. 317.
&quot;These Portuguese having murdered Mar Ignatius, we will no longer join them. We renounce them, and do not want either their love or their favour. The present Francis, bishop, shall not be our governor. We are not his children or followers. We will not again acknowledge Portuguese bishops.&quot;

Those who were not able to touch the cross-tied ropes on the cross held the rope in their hands and made the oath. Because of the weight it is believed by the followers that the cross bent a little and so it is known as &quot;Oath of the bent cross&quot; (&quot;Coonen Kurisu Sathyam&quot;).

Four months after this event, according to the beliefs, 12 elders of the church ordained the elder Thomas as their prelate with the ecclesiastical title Mar Thoma I.

Their beliefs and practices before the arrival of the Portuguese as evident in the canons of the Synod of Diamper.

Malankara Church,
*maintained the spiritual presence of the body and blood of Christ in the sacrament.
*had no knowledge of the term purgatory, but prayed for the dead.
*had irregular practice of auricular confession.
*only had a few celibacy clergy in monastic rank, while celibate bishops visited periodically from the Middle East.

=== Dutch period ===
The Dutch East India Company defeated Portuguese for the supremacy of spice trade in Malabar in the year CE 1663. Malankara Nazranis used this opportunity to escape from Latin persecution with the help of the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch brought Bishop Gregorios Abdul Jaleel of Jerusalem of the Syrian Orthodox Church in their trading vessel in CE 1665. Thomas Arkadyaqon who was consecrated as Mar Thoma I entered into a relationship with the West Syriac Orthodox Church and gradually adopted West Syriac liturgy and practices. The Dutch were on the Malabar Coast from 11 November 1604 – 1795. Mar Thoma I to Mar Thoma VI were the prelates during this period.

=== British period ===
The English defeated the Dutch in 1795 and took over Cochin during the time of Mar Thoma VI. In 1806, Rev. Dr. Claudius Buchanan, an Anglican missionary visited Malankara and met Mar Thoma VI. The Bible that was translated from the original Aramaic into Malayalam by two Malpans (Syriac Professors) was printed with the help of Buchanan.

The early British Residents happened to be people of evangelical persuasions and were curious about the native church. In 1808, a bond for the sum of 3000 Star Pagoda (Rs. 10,500) was handed over by General Colin Macaulay, the British Resident in Travancore to the Govt. for Mar Thoma VII with the condition that the interest (known as Vattipanam) be paid to the Metropolitan of the Syrian Church of Malabar. The next Resident Colonel John Munro was approached by a monk (Ramban) Pulikkottil Joseph Ittoop, with the idea of setting up a seminary for the Malankara church. The idea appealed to Munro and under his patronage, the Ramban got the construction completed by 1815. At the resident&#x27;s behest, the Anglican Church Mission Society sent its missionaries on a &quot;Mission of Help&quot;, to educate the seminarians. In 1815, Joseph Ramban was consecrated by Philexenos of the Thozhyoor Church and was given the ecclesiastical title Dionysius II. To make the Malankara Church accept him as their head, Col. Munro had to get the rulers of Travancore and Cochin issue Royal proclamations ordering Christians to render obedience to Dionysius II. The next two prelates were also selected by Col. Munro and Royal proclamations were issued to them also.

The British missionaries believed that a reformation of the Malankara Church was imperative (since, for instance, they found in the Indian church &quot;those doctrines which we threw off at the Reformation: &quot;Purgatory ... worshipping and adoration of images and relics, and also invocation of saints&#x27;&quot;) whose presence made reform imperative, and ventured to bring it about through a process of theological instruction and subtle persuasion. By and by, they prodded Metropolitan Punnathra Dionysius III into convening an assembly of his leading kathanars and missionaries at Mavelikkara to discuss the matter. This meeting which took place on 3 December 1818, appointed a committee of six elder kathanars to come up with scheme for reformation, in consultation with the metropolitan and missionaries. Some priests like Abraham Malpan, Kaithayil Gheevarghese Malpan etc., who worked along with the missionaries at the Kottayam seminary were part of this committee. They were especially receptive to Anglican ideas. Before the committee brought their findings Punnathra Dionosyus died and Cheppad Dionosyus became the Malankara Metropolitan. Cheppad Dionosyus rejected the committee findings and went on with actions that was against the reforms made by his predecessors. Later, as Anglicans such as Joseph Peet tried to dominate the Pazhaya Seminary and started to create other issue in the Church, Malankara metropolitan Dionysius IV convened a synod at Mavelikkara on 16 January 1836, where-in the participants resolved not to deviate from their Oriental Orthodox faith or traditions and to remain faithful to the Patriarch of Antioch. This ended the official partnership between the missionaries and the Malankara Syrian Church.

== Reformation in Malankara Church ==
The British Anglicans had many well-wishers in the Malankara Church. Priests like Abraham Malpan and others continued to collaborate with the missionaries to reform the church from within. In 1836, Abraham Malpan, Kaithayil Gheevarghese malpan and other reformist kathanars submitted a memorandum to Resident Col. Fraser, levelling charges of abuse against metropolitan Dionysius IV and a 23-point stratagem for the reformation of the church. But as the metropolitan was against all reforms, nothing came of it. Regardless, Abraham Malpan produced a reformed revision of the West Syriac Rite and used it in the seminary and his parishes. Consequently, Abraham Malpan was excommunicated. Malankara metropolitan Dionysius IV refused to ordain anyone trained by reformist malpans.

=== Abraham Malpan ===
Though Maramon Palakunnathu Abraham Malpan was bounteous in his temperament, he never hesitated to introduce reforms in both teaching and practice. He also insisted on a high moral standard of conduct for laity and clergy alike. All this created a ferment in the Malankara Church and its effects are still discernible in the Church as a whole.

The Church also recognises her as the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Christ, who is God, not that the nature of the Word or his divinity received the beginning of its existence from the holy Virgin, but that, since the holy body, which the Word of God became, was born from her, the Word is said to be born according to the flesh (Gospel of St.John:1:14).

=== Course of events ===
The first printed Malayalam Bible, translated from Syriac was published in 1811. Known as Ramban Bible it contained only the four Gospels. By 1841, the whole Bible was translated, printed and released. Counselled by Anglican missionaries who taught at the Orthodox Theological Seminary, Mar Thoma XI convened a meeting of representatives of the Malankara Church with the missionaries at Mavelikkara in 1818. In that meeting, a review committee was appointed to recommend reforms, in consultation with the metropolitan and the missionaries. Abraham Malpan, Kaithayil Geevarghese Malpan, Eruthikkal Markose Kathanar, Adangapurathu Joseph Kathanar were members of this committee. This was the first step in carrying out Reformation in Malankara Church.

On 5 September 1836, the reformation was planned. The strategy was determined by a group of 12 clergymen under the leadership of Abraham Malpan. They issued an encyclical describing what they believed were the wrong teachings, a statement listing twenty-four practices of the Church which they believed were &quot;evil&quot; and had crept in by its association with other Churches and religions and the same as a petition to a British Resident.
On 27 August 1837 (Sunday), then suspended Abraham Malpan conducted the Holy Communion service in mother tongue Malayalam at his home parish at Maramon. Clergymen, who supported him also did the same thing in various other parishes on the same day.

Connected with a saint (Baselios Yeldo), every year in the first week of October, there was a church festival at Maramon. During that time a wooden statue of that saint, they called &quot;Muthappen&quot; (Meaning:- Elder father) was taken around in procession, and people used to venerate the saint by offering prayers and ask for intercession. In 1837, Abraham Malpan from deeper biblical understandings and of the spiritual scruples surrounding it, took the statue and threw it into a well saying, &quot;Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?&quot; (Isaiah 8:19). So when the festival came there was no statue to be taken out for the procession.

The use of the revised liturgy and the changes he brought about in practices disgruntled Mar Thoma XII. So Abraham Malpan was excommunicated. Deacons trained by him were refused priesthood. But Abraham Malpan was not disheartened. He continued with his spirited reforms. He returned to Maramon. Many of his students joined him to continue their studies. All those who believed that &quot;The Church&quot; needed a revitalization also joined him. Members of parishes in Kozhencherry, Kumbanad, Eraviperoor, Thumpamon, Elanthoor, Kundara, Kottarakara, Mavelikkara, Mallapally, and many other places made trips to Maramon to attend the service in Malayalam and listen to his sermons. Doors were also opened for reformation in other places by ministers who supported him.

At this stage, he had three choices in front of him. Repent and go to the beliefs under Antioch; join the Anglican Church with western aid; or go forward with the Cleansing and restoring &quot;The Church&quot; to what he thought would bring it to a pristine position, A church uncontaminated by avarice, venality, licentiousness, and rapacity. He selected the third one. Abraham Malpan died in 1845.

Realising the need for a bishop to lead the reformists, Abraham malpan sent his nephew Deacon Matthews to the patriarch in Antioch. The patriarch, unaware of Mathew&#x27;s reformation leanings, ordained him as bishop Mathews Athanasius in 1842 and he returned to Travancore in 1843. Metropolitan Dionysius IV sent word to the patriarch that he has been deceived and called for prompt corrective action. Mathews Athanasius did not have the approval of the majority of Malankara Christians who were opposed to reforms. In spite of that, the initial patriarchate delegations failed in their mission to help their loyalists. More than anything else, this was due to the British support for the Reformist bishop and Mathews Athanasius ultimately became Malankara Metropolitan in 1852. Mathews Athanasius published the liturgy without the prayer to St. Mary. He consecrated Ouseph Koorilos, as Metropolitan/Bishop for Malabar Independent Church. The entirety of strong-arm actions incited many clergymen and Pulikkottil Ouseph Kathanar went to Antioch in 1864. He returned as Dionysious V in 1865.

The Orthodox conservatives led by Dionysious V repeatedly sought intervention from the See of Antioch. Discerning the source of the reformists&#x27; strength, Patriarch Ignatius Peter IV travelled to London. Whilst being there, he made many supplications to several high ecclesiastical and governmental authorities, pleading to end the partisan British support for Mathews Athanasius in India. Eventually, the British government and churchmen came to accept a position of neutrality with respect to the affairs of the Malankara Church. The Archbishop of Canterbury Archibald Campbell Tait apprised the patriarch of this change in British stance. Armed with significant success, the patriarch sailed for India.

=== Separation of the Reformists and establishment of Mar Thoma Church ===

After reaching India, the Antiochian patriarch did everything within his power to aid the traditionalist Orthodox faithful. In 1875, Patriarch Ignatius Peter IV excommunicated Mathews Athanasius, Thomas Athanasius (ordained by Mathews Athanasius as his successor) and their Reformist followers from the Malankara Syrian Church. The Reformists desperately besought the Archbishop of Canterbury as well as British authorities, to intervene on their behalf, but to no avail. The British colonial administration abstained from extending their crucial endorsement to any one faction, thereby disengaging themselves from local church matters. Thus, the rival parties had to settle their disputes, entirely by means of court litigations.

Dionysious V and his supporters filed a case on 4 March 1879. (Case O.S. No. 439 of 1054) demanding the possession of the seminary and the control of assets of the Church. Thomas Athanasius was then the Metropolitan.

During the course of this litigation (1879–1889), answering a question Thomas Athanasius Metropolitan said,
A meeting was convened by the maharaja of Travancore, before the final verdict was given, Athanasius testified that,

The final verdict which came on 12 July 1889, upheld the conservative position on the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch, as being the only competent ecclesiastical authority historically authorized to ordain and appoint bishops to the Malankara Metropolitanate. The ruling declared Dionysious V the rightful Malankara Metropolitan owing to his loyalty to the Antiochian patriarchate known as Jacobite Syrian Christian Church wherefrom he received direct consecration and his acceptance by the majority of Malankara Christians. The judgement also dismissed all claims of the reformists and their leader Thomas Athanasius to the Metropolitanate or its assets. The Metran Kakshi decided to remain as an independent Malankara Church, and to give primary authority to the Holy Bible and continue as the successors of St. Thomas throne. They separated and established the Oriental Protestant Mar Thoma Syrian Church.

== Mar Thoma church during Indian Independence Movement ==

Many in the Church were fascinated by Gandhian philosophy and particularly its Primates Abraham Thoma, Yuhanon Mar Thoma, and Alexander Mar Thoma were strong Advocates of Gandhian methods. They wore Ecclesiastical robes stitched from Khadi. The church actively worked in areas of education, empowerment of women, eradication of social evils, and self-reliance. Mar Thoma Sabha councils and Maramon Convention became a platform for disseminating Nationalist ideas. Many nationalist leaders like K. Keshavan, C. V. Kunjiraman, T. M. Varghese, Pattam Thanupillai had used Maramon Convention to mobilize people against Divan Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer&#x27;s move to form an Independent Travancore separate from India. In 1936 Kunjiraman through his speech at Maramon gave an ultimatum to Travancore Royalty to give freedom of worship in temples for all Hindus immediately or see mass conversions to Christianity. The practice of political leaders attending with the Christian gathering at Maramon has its origin from that period.

Ramaswami Iyer liquidated the Quilon bank and sealed off Malayala Manorama, the leading newspaper, for criticizing the divan. Abraham Mar Thoma spoke about these notorious acts and visited those who were jailed by him. He further visited the maharaja of Travancore and complaint about Divans tyrannical rule. Mar Thoma church at this point passed a church resolution against Divan and independent Travancore which infuriated the divan and ordered for the Metropolitans arrest and imprisonment. However, the arrest order was not executed. It was all done at a point of time when other churches and communities of Travancore praised divan or feared to utter a word against the divan. Later the Mar Thoma church had to pay the price for that social action. The land allotted in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram to construct a church by Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal was taken back. Mar Thoma church was selectively targeted by Divan, by not giving permissions for the construction of cemeteries and new church buildings.

Thevarthundiyil Titus popularly known as Titusji was the only Christian in the band of 78 inmates selected by Gandhiji from Sabarmati Ashram for breaking the salt law at Dandi in 1930 (Popularly known as Salt March). In 1937 when Mahatma Gandhiji was touring Kottayam, Mar Thoma Seminary School opened its doors to Gandhiji. He stayed a night there with K. K. Kuruvila is popularly known as Kerala Deenabandhu (because of his close association with C. F. Andrews Deenabandhu), then principal of the school, he was an MA graduate from Trinity College (Connecticut). Kuruvila was the founder of newspaper &quot;Kerala Bhooshanam&quot; which was active during the movement for responsible government in Travancore during the 1940s. K. C. Thomas (1901–1976) another noted freedom fighter of the era and once President of &quot;Nivarthana Prasthanam&quot; was in the thick of the agitations against Sir C.P.&#x27;s rule in Travancore. He was the secretary of the Jilla Committee of the State Congress was arrested along with Kannara Gopala Panikkar and jailed on 21 September 1938. Their Arrests led to widespread protests in Chengannur and finally led to the infamous &#x27;Mills Maidhan Event&#x27; on 28 September 1938 where Divans police used brutal force to dismiss the protesting crowd which resulted in bloodshed. Cherian Thomas son of K.C. Thomas was actively involved with the Bhoodan Movement of Acharya Vinoba Bhave. N.G. Chacko, the freedom fighter plunged into freedom struggle during 1920. He was arrested and jailed for anti-British protests and waving black flag in protest against the visit of the Prince of Wales Lord Wellington, then governor-general in 1921. P.T. Punnoose is another leader of the era, he started his political activities through Congress party in 1938 however later he became a Communist leader. He was the secretary of Travancore Communist Party and one of the organisers of the Punnapra Vayalar Revolt. He laid strong foundations for the Communist party in Ambalappuzha, Cherthala, and Alappuzha. He was later elected from Ambalapuzha Constituency to the Indian Parliament.

T. M. Varghese was a Christian among the trio who formed the Joint Political Party and spearheaded for the formation of a responsible Government. Another Mar Thoma Syrian and Gandhian of that era K.A. Mathew started his activities by writing articles in the magazine &quot;The Christian Patriot&quot; which articulated the dissemination of nationalist feelings among Indian Christians. In 1939 at Amsterdam when the union jack was raised in &quot;International Christian Youth Assembly&quot; for Indian delegates, K.A. Mathew raised the Indian flag in solidarity and carried along with him. Back in Travancore he was active in the movement against Divan Sir C.P. and his independent Travancore. He opposed a move among the Syrian Christians of Tiruvalla to erect a statue of Divan at the center of the town. He was implicated in many false allegations and cases by the divan and jailed him many times. He was elected to legislative assembly in 1948. Barrister George Joseph a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and a Home Rule proponent mobilized the people in the Vaikom Satyagraha in early stages but later handed over the leadership to K. Kelappan as per the wishes of Gandhiji. During his stay in Madurai he was closely associated with labour union movement and worked in changing the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA), which targeted specifically Kallar and Mukkulathor community. They affectionately called him Rosappu Durai (Master with a rose flower). He was a close friend of K. Kamaraj and Tamil Poet Subramanya Bharathi. Subramanya Bharathi Penned the patriotic song &quot;Viduthalai Viduthalai&quot; when he was staying at George&#x27;s home. Seven years prior to his death George Joseph joined the Catholic church. Many young Syrian Christians who were staying in Malaya during the 1940s was attracted to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and joined the INA. O.C. Chacko a Marthomite from Kuriannoor, joined the Indian National Army in 1943 when he was in Singapore. A Mar Thoma priest, Rev. C.V. George from Ranny in his youth as an advocate was an active member in the freedom struggle and was jailed for his involvement in activities against British Raj. He is the only Mar Thoma Priest who is recognized and awarded as a freedom fighter by the Government.

After India attained its freedom in 1947, the Government of India lowered to the level of a despotic rule during the time of Emergency of 1975. The Emergency was followed after election malpractice allegation and following the verdict against Indira Gandhi. All leaders who spoke against the Emergency rule were jailed or kept in house arrest. It was at this time Yuhanon Mar Thoma wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India criticizing emergency and requesting to follow ideals of constitution. There were strong rumors about the anticipatory arrest of Yuhanon Mar Thoma. M.M.Thomas another Mar Thoma Syrian and theologian advocating Ecumenism of Churches had written many articles on the emergency situation. In spite of criticism from many Christian groups, M.M. Thomas made his point in depicting the basic fact of violation of human rights and stressed the need of the democratic organization of the people for the realization of social justice in India. Mar Thoma Church also passed a resolution against Emergency and for the restoration of democracy privately. Mar Thoma church was also closely associated with the land for the landless and home for the homeless movement much before Acharya Vinoba Bhave initiated Bhoodan movement.

== Faith and practices of the church ==

=== Liturgy ===

The word &quot;liturgy&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;leitourgia&quot; (&quot;leitos&quot;/&quot;loas&quot;: people +&quot;ergos&quot;: work) which means a service rendered to God and people. When the Bible was not available, the liturgy took the role of the Bible, much of the scripture is formed in the liturgical context. The original liturgical language used by the Malankara Church was Aramaic and Hebrew. The Bible that was in use also was in Hebrew. Later when Syriac replaced Aramaic in eastern countries, and the arrival of Knanaya people from Persia in AD 345, the Malankara Church began using Syriac. The Bible used in the Malankara Church is called the &quot;Peshitta&quot; and was in Estrangelo Syriac. This was the Bible that was in use till Malayalam (the language of Kerala) translation was available. The first printed Malayalam Bible, translated from Syriac was published in 1811 by Philipose Ramban with the provision of Claudius Buchanan, known as Ramban Bible it contained the four Gospels. (A copy of this Bible was later presented to Buchanan and is kept at Cambridge University Library.) By 1841, the whole Bible was translated, printed and released by missionary-scholar Benjamin Bailey with the help of Chandu Menon, a tahsildar in the Madras State service. Even though bishops from Syrian churches visited Kerala, they did not attempt to change the Bible into the newer forms of Syriac or to the native language. In June 1876, Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Pathrose IV visited Kerala and a majority of the Malankara Church accepted him as the head of their church. But those who did not join them continued to follow their own leaders and kept their peculiar identity garnered from reformation. After Mar Thoma Church had begun to use the liturgy in mother tongue Malayalam, other churches continued to follow the same for a deeper engagement with the laity. A revised version of the ancient and apostolic liturgy known as People&#x27;s liturgy, the Liturgy of St James (Gal.1:18-19), was adopted in the church, later the liturgy has been translated into various languages, including English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. The Mar Thoma church follows the West Syrian liturgical tradition and is Eastern in the nature of its worship and ethos.

There are six liturgies other than Saint James liturgy (Mar Yakub liturgy) used in the church and a priest can exercise freedom in using them but should satisfy the requirement of &quot;joint congregation act/involvement&quot; and permission from the respective diocese head. The six other liturgies are:
=== Canonical hours ===
The Marthomites pray the canonical hours as contained in the Shehimo at seven fixed prayer times while facing the eastward direction.

=== Sacraments of the church ===
The seven sacraments (Koodashas) of Mar Thoma Church are:
== Places of worship ==


Those who were converted by St. Thomas in the 1st century continued worshiping in synagogues. Then they moved to their homes and by the 2nd century, they began to build their own churches (called ‘&#x27;Palli&#x27;’) in various places. It is believed that there were such small gatherings at Maliankara, Piravom, Niranam (Nelcynda) and Nilakkal. St. Thomas Christians in Kerala, still construct their churches combining the design of Solomon&#x27;s temple at Jerusalem, and Indian Vastu Shastra. So from outside it looks like a Hindu temple but inside it is like a Jewish temple. It is divided into Sanctuary (Madbaha) and Nave (Haickala). Mar Thoma Churches are built east–west with the Sanctuary (Madbaha) to the east. East is the place of the rising suns that is the symbol of the Risen Christ and His Second coming. East also symbolizes the Garden of Eden that was situated in the east. The Sanctuary is separated from the rest of the place by a veil with the sign of a cross. The worship of the Eastern churches symbolizes heavenly worship. Madbaha symbolically represents Heaven and Haickala, the earth, and veil the sky. The Madbaha is demarcated from the bema with an open arch and a veil. At the beginning of Holy Qurbana Service, the veil is drawn from the right side to left. Mar Thoma Syrians have abandoned the West syriac tradition of erecting more than one Altar and Madhbaha in Church and also forbade dedication of Altar/Thronos in name of a Saint or a Holy church father and conducting Holy Qurbana at Altar simultaneously or separate. The pulpit and lectern are also usually found at the extension of the bema. Bema is demarcated from the nave and transept (widely uses a vestibule space before the nave) with altar rails. The Choir is seated at one end of the transepts in the same level of the nave. Now there is a tendency to follow western architectural designs and introducing ciboriums, semi-domes, etc.

Cross used in Mar Thoma Church Chancel particularly at the center of the Altar is the Easter Cross. In Mar Thoma worship practice the visual Sign of the Cross is used many times. When the Priest gives the blessing he performs the sign of the cross; the worshipers, as a sign of accepting the blessing also reciprocates blessing oneself. The same is done at the time of the declaration of the Trinity and also at the time of indication of the Cross. Generally iconostases, pictures or statues of saints are not kept in Mar Thoma churches. Until the middle of the 20th century, all worshipers were seated on a mat spread on the floor. Children occupy the first rows and behind them on right side females and towards left males are seated. A narrow space between left and right is demarcated with a red carpet starting from the main door signifying that the church is sharing the worship space of heaven and joining the communion. Now many churches provide chairs or benches. During the Passion week services, chairs are removed, to facilitate worshiping according to their ancient custom, which includes prostrating a number of times. Everyone including clergy and the laity, who take part in the worship, faces east for the service.

== Fasts and Festivals of Mar Thoma Church ==
Mar Thoma Church&#x27;s evolution from a reformation base only strengthened it to follow best practices of its Syriac traditions. Lents (&quot;Nombu&quot;) and other church festivals are church&#x27;s structural and liturgical base. Feasts and fasts are an integral part of the traditions of a Christian community. However, the way believers follow these fasts and feasts differ from church to church. Mar Thoma church being a part of Antiochian tradition churches, follows all the canonical feasts and fasts which are related to important events in the life of Jesus Christ. The constitution of the church states that the feasts, fasts or lents are not to be removed or altered from the church at any time. It Includes Observance of the Sunday as the day of the lord and other fast and feast days in the church calendar. Each Sunday is dedicated to meditating on subjects prescribed in church lectionary.

=== Fasts of the Church ===
The church mainly observes the fifty days before the period of Easter and twenty-five days before Christmas as fast days. Mar Thoma church doesn&#x27;t have a canonical instruction on how a believer should follow the Lents. However, as a matter of practice believers follow certain dietary restrictions with the right spiritual diet as followed over generations. A person committed to lent, is in a spiritual training with introspection and renewal of their commitment to be an imitation of set principles by Jesus Christ. With the will for fellowship, each person anchors bio-psycho-spiritually with Jesus Christ through prayer. Lent is often considered as a refreshful practice for thoughts and soul for cultivating seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (Book of Isaiah ). An amount of money that is saved by giving up certain types of luxuries during the lent period is typically deposited in the offertory on Good Friday for Church&#x27;s social services for the afflicted and hungry (Book of Isaiah ). Post-modernistic view about lent is as an empowering practice that transforms a person for making social and interpersonal impact. Every weekday in Great Lent there are specific liturgical services which include prostration or profound bows a number of times. The lents of the church are:

* Great Fast: consists of 40 days from the second week of February (&quot;Petrutha&quot;:Reconciliation) ending with 40th Friday, this symbolizes the forty days fast of Jesus Christ in the desert and extends with a ten days fast, that signifies the betrayal, passion, and crucifixion of Jesus Christ (Passion week-&quot;Hasha&quot;) as per oriental tradition. It spreads to 7 weeks with a total of 50 days (&quot;Ambathu Nombu&quot;). Ash Wednesday is the first Wednesday of the lent, it is not observed with significance.
* Nativity Fast (Yeldo lent): 25 days prior to Christmas which includes annunciation to Zechariah and to Joseph.
* Dormition of Mary (Shunoyo Lent): 15 days, in August. (This is not observed widely but some may fulfill this fast along with the reformation day celebration without the doctrinal underpinnings.)
* Fast of Nineveh (Lent of Yonah): 3 days in January.
* Apostles&#x27; Fast (Lent of Sleeha&#x27;s): 13 specific days from the second week of June.

=== Feasts of the Church ===
The main feast or festival days of the church are Feast of Nativity, Baptism of Jesus, Feast of Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, Feast of the Ascension, Day of Pentecost, and Feast of the Transfiguration. The most important festivals of the church are that of in Holy Week (&quot;Hasha&quot;) and Christmas. The festivals of Mar Thoma Church can be divided into 4 categories, they are:

* Maranaya Festivals- Festivals that are based on events in the life of Jesus Christ: Mainly they are Danaha (Baptism of Christ/Epiphany), Mayaltho (Presentation of Jesus at the Temple), Suboro (Feast of the Annunciation), Hosanna (Palm Sunday), Easter (Resurrection Sunday or &quot;Kyomtho&quot;), Christmas (Feast of Nativity or &quot;Yaldo&quot;).
* Roohanaya Festivals- Festivals related to Holy Spirit. Mainly they are Suloko (Feast of the Ascension), Sunday of Pentecost or Trinity Sunday- It is fifty days after Easter Day (at times it is observed separately), it commemorates the descent of the holy spirit on to the Church, Day of Transfiguration- 10th week after the day of Pentecost, this is when traditionally low abv vinification is started at homes for Christmas.
* Ethanaya Festivals- Festivals related to the church like Kudos Etho: The sanctification of the church and beginning of liturgical year, Hudos Etho – The dedication or renewal of the church, Reformation Day (August), Mar Thoma Church Day (In relation to Thomas the Apostle on 21 December).
* Dukrano Festivals: Church day separated for meditation on Martyrdom of Apostles without intercession (This is not observed widely except St. Stephen&#x27;s Day).

The Ethanaya Feasts Kudos Etho and Hudos Etho is in the second and third Sundays of November, it is also considered as the beginning of a liturgical year. The Holy week or passion week (&quot;Hasha&quot;) is the week before Easter and the last week of Great Lent, this includes Palm Sunday (Hosanna- Commemorating princely entry of Christ into Jerusalem), Maundy Thursday (Pesach- Commemorating last meal or passover of Jesus Christ with his disciples and the Holy Communion was instituted on this day), Good Friday (Holy Friday – Commemorating crucifixion of Christ at Golgotha), Joyous Saturday, and Easter (Resurrection Sunday – Commemorating Resurrection of Christ).

Christmas is celebrated by all members of the Church, to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ. During this time, parishes will be involved in Christmas carols and the celebration of Christmas Day church services with Christmas cakes. Before the 1850s, Mar Thoma church celebrated Christmas on 6 January, the day of Epiphany. By the end of last century, Christmas trees, Christmas Stars-an illuminative paper decoration made in the form of star or sunburst, Christmas lights, Sky lanterns, Nativity crib, Santa Claus&#x27; and other related festive traditions have appeared in the church.

== Ordination of women and transgender people ==
There are no theological impediments to the ordination of women, in the Mar Thoma Syrian Church. Being theologically Protestant, this church endorses the Priesthood of all believers. However the church hasn&#x27;t ordained women yet, as it is not in accordance with Eastern Christian traditions. Female Archbishop Kay Goldsworthy of the Anglican Church of Australia, was one of the main speakers at the 2020 Maramon Convention, organized by the Mar Thoma Church. On the question of women&#x27;s ordination, the Mar Thoma church&#x27;s official response to the Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry document of the World Council of Churches reads,

Howsoever it is to be noted that the Mar Thoma Church has provided caution that the BEM Document should not be considered as a confession of faith and order, rather it should be seen as a document that closes that gap between Churches across the world.

The Mar Thoma Church is involved with several movements and projects, aiming at the upliftment and empowerment of the Transgender community. In 2018, two transgender speakers were given the stage, to address the Maramon convention of the Mar Thoma Church.
Joseph Mar Thoma, a former head of the Mar Thoma Church, made it clear that there are no biblical grounds to deny priesthood and baptism for transgender individuals. It is also noteworthy that Joseph Mar Thoma, the former head of the Mar Thoma Church took the example of &quot;Philip and the Eunuch&quot;, and how the Eunuch played an important role in development of Ethiopian Christianity.

Theodosius Mar Thoma the current head of the Mar Thoma Church, has said that the time will come, when transgender people would be ordained as priests in the church. He said,
== Organizations ==

=== Auxiliary organizations ===
Development Department; Christian Agency for Rural Development (CARD); Mar Thoma Medical Mission; Mar Thoma Sabha Mandiram Fellowship; Social Welfare Institutions; Theological Institutions; Educational Institutions; Technical Institutions; Study Centres; Church Animation Centre; and Camp Centres are other empowerment organizations of the church.

=== Educational institutions ===
Nine colleges, six higher secondary schools, one vocational higher secondary school, eight high schools, one training school, five technical institutions plus other educational institutions owned and managed by individuals and by parishes.

=== Other institutions ===
There are 38 social welfare institutions, 14 destitute homes, and ten hospitals. The Mar Thoma Theological Seminary, Kottayam (established 1926) &amp; Karukachal (Annex), Dharmajyoti Vidyapeedom, Haryana, E.J. Institute of Evangelism, and 4 other institutes cater to the theological education of both the clergy and the laity. Three study centres at Managanam, Kottayam and Trivandrum for arranging regular study programs and to provide opportunities for creative dialogue between Church and society on various ethical, moral, social and religious issues. The religious education of children is looked after by the Sunday School Samajam (organized in 1905) and the work among youth is carried on by the Youth Department, (the Yuvajana Sakhyam organized in 1933). The Church has a Women&#x27;s Department (the Mar Thoma Suvisesha Sevika Sanghom organized in 1919).

== Maramon Convention ==

The Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association, the missionary wing of the Mar Thoma Church, is in charge of organising the Maramon Convention, One of the largest annual Christian gathering in Asia. It takes place in Maramon, near Kozhencherry, during February on the vast sand-bed of the Pampa River next to the Kozhencherry Bridge. The first convention was held in March 1895 for 10 days.

The Maramon Convention is principally an assembly of Christians who go there once a year to listen to the gospel as read and expounded by Christian leaders from all over India as well as abroad. This provides a revived ideological and experiential faith in accordance to the need of the laity and period of time. It is in tune with Mathew 6:5. Attendees sit on the sand bed, Old and invalid people are given chairs with separate sponsored or paid seating arrangements. Generally, one session is for ecumenical messages by invited leaders of other churches.

== Ecumenical relations ==
The church actively participates in the programs of the World Council of Churches, the Christian Conference of Asia, the National Council of Churches and the Kerala Christian Council. Mar Thoma Church was attending meetings of World Council of Churches from its first meeting in 1948 at Amsterdam. At the WCC meetings held in Evanston, Juhanon Mar Thoma Metropolitan was elected as one of its presidents. Since then the Church representatives attended all the General meetings.

=== Relationship with the Anglican Communion ===
Due to the historic links of the Malankara reformation to the Anglican missionary enterprise in colonial India and the resultant formative influence, the Mar Thoma Church maintain close relations with the Anglican Church. The Church&#x27;s theology and doctrines are closest to that of Anglicans; hence Mar Thoma as well as some Anglican Churches commemorate each other&#x27;s bishops, in their respective Eucharists. The Mar Thoma church is in full communion with all the churches of the Anglican Communion. The two denominations fully accept each other&#x27;s ministry. Mar Thoma bishops also take part in the Lambeth Conferences. Pastoral care and episcopal oversight for Mar Thoma congregations and dioceses in the Western world, comes from territorial Anglican provinces, on an as-needed basis. In the UK, such a partnership exists with the Church of England, in Ireland with the Church of Ireland, in the US with the Episcopal Church, in Canada with the Anglican Church of Canada and in Australia with the Anglican Church of Australia. In India, their communion partners are the Church of South India and the Church of North India. These three churches work together on various issues as the Communion of Churches in India. One such issue is focusing on transgender rights.

Mar Thoma bishops have acted as co-consecrators in the ordination of Anglican bishops, on a number of occasions. In 1970, Mar Thoma bishop Alexander Mar Theophilus was a co-consecrator, who ordained seven original CNI bishops, as part of the inauguration of the united Church of North India. In 2011, Joseph Mar Thoma participated as co-consecrator, in the episcopal ordination of Thomas K. Oommen of the Church of South India. In 2011, Mar Thoma bishop Euyakim Mar Coorilos participated as co-consecrator, in the episcopal ordination of Dhiloraj Canagasabey of the Church of Ceylon. In 2015, Mar Thoma bishop Geevarghese Mar Theodosius participated as co-consecrator, in the episcopal ordination of Peter Eaton of the Episcopal Church (United States). Female primate Katharine Jefferts Schori was the principal consecrator for this ordination.

=== Relationship with Malabar Independent Syrian church ===
There is a historic relationship between Mar Thoma Syrian Church and Malabar Independent Syrian Church, although the doctrinal positions are not mutually accepted in full. Church of Thozhiyoor (Anjoor) and its primates have come in rescue of Malankara church many times. After the demise of Pulikkottil Joseph Dionysious (Mar Thoma X) and Punnathra Geevarghese Dionysious, Kidangan Geevarghese Philoxinos of Thozhiyoor Church reigned as Malankara Metropolitan as per the Royal Proclamation and returned the title back to Malankara Church without any claim after consecrating Punnathra Geevarghese Dionysious and Cheppad Geevarghese mar Dionysious for Malankara church. Similarly in 1863 Malankara Metropolitan Mathews Athanasious defended Thozhiyoor Church as an Independent Syrian Church in Madras High Court against Euyakim Koorilos Design to subordinate the Thozhiyoor Church under Antioch. From that verdict onwards Church of Thozhiyoor came to be known as Malabar Independent Syrian Church. When the Metropolitan Thomas Athanasius died without consecrating a successor in 1893, it was the Metropolitan of the Thozhiyoor Church who consecrated Metropolitan Titus I Mar Thoma, and helped the Mar Thoma Church in a serious crisis. Mar Thoma Metropolitans have since then helped in consecrating the Metropolitans of Thozhiyoor Church and vice versa. According to the constitution of the Thozhiyoor Church, when difficulties arise the Thozhiyoor Church should seek the advice and guidance of the Mar Thoma Metropolitan despite the fact that either Church has no authority over the other. Thus the relation between the Thozhiyoor Church and Mar Thoma Church is unique. The centenary of the fraternal relationship between the two Churches was celebrated in the Sabha Mandalam on 14 September 1994.

=== Relationship with Syrian Church and the Patriarch of Antioch ===

Mar Thoma Church has special regards and respect to Syriac Orthodox Church. The Apostolic succession of Mar Thoma Episcopacy, St James liturgy, Ecclesiastical tradition, and order are all from West Syriac Tradition of Antioch. The First Reforming Metropolitan of Malankara Mathews Athanasious was ordained to ecclesiastical orders by Patriarch Elias of Antioch in 1842. After Demise of Mathews Athanasious, the ecclesiastical robe and other insignia were sent to the Patriarch of Antioch as per tradition. It was later returned to Mar Thoma Church during the time of Patriarch Zakka I. Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I and Patriarch Ignatius Aphrem II have visited Maraman Convention and blessed its faithful. Mar Thoma Church has made a convention or practice that it will never consecrate a bishop with the name &quot;Ignatius&quot; the Ecclesiastical Title of Patriarch. Other Malankara churches started consecrating their own Holy Muron, Mar Thoma church still have not done that. Mar Thoma church hitherto has been increasing and using the holy muron Consecrated by Patriarch Elias and brought to Malankara by Mathews Athanasious in 1842. Mar Thoma church maintains good relations with Jacobite Syrian Christian Church. There is an active ecumenical dialogue between the Syrian orthodox church and Mar Thoma Church for mutual acceptance and wider communion.

=== Relationship with Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church ===
Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church and Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church have the same Malankara antiquity and heritage that dates back to Saint Thomas&#x27; mission in Kerala, as well as West Syriac St James liturgical traditions dating back to the Puthenkoor faction.
These churches are often referred as &quot;Swadeshi&quot; Churches as both have their spiritual and temporal leaders based within Kerala, India unlike many other Christian Churches of Kerala. However, there is no official Holy communion relationship between both the churches.

At the same time, both clergy and laity come together in matters of social and public concern.
Ecumenical worship services during Christmas season is common outside Kerala among the diaspora, and also at many places within Kerala.

Marriages between the members of the two Churches are very common given the mutual historical privileged caste status of Kerala Syrian Christian community, although ecclesiastical authorities like to discourage such alliances and may not grant proper documents.
Leaders of both churches have held ecumenical dialogues to discuss their differences in theology, traditions or practices that still remain pending clarification for mutual recognition, joint theological education and research, and communion; such efforts remain ongoing.

There are many church leaders in both the churches who are widely respected across the larger Syrian Christian community, irrespective of their individual affiliation.
Mar Thoma church has established an internal tradition that it will never consecrate an Episcopal or Metropolitan with the Greek name &quot;Baselios&quot; The ecclesiastical title of Catholicos of Edessa, which is now being used for primates of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church( holding the ecclesiastical title of Catholicos of the East) and Jacobite Syrian Christian Church (holding ecclesiastical title of Catholicos of India).
Both Mar Thoma Church and Malankara Orthodox Church believes that their Primates are occupying the Ecclesiastical Throne of St Thomas.

Both churches share church buildings to conduct their worship services at several places such as Chengannur, Koorthamala, Bahrain, Hyderabad etc. with peace and mutual love. These serve as examples of Christian Unity and brotherhood that many other churches can learn from and replicate.

=== Relationship with STECI, Old Catholic and Lutheran churches ===
The Mar Thoma Church has concluded its ecumenical dialogue with the Old Catholic Churches of the Union of Utrecht in 2014. This dialogue is in the process of reception. There is an ecumenical dialogue of the Mar Thoma Syrian Church with the Lutheran churches.

=== Relationship with Eastern Catholic Churches in India ===
The church maintains friendly relations with the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church; but the Catholic doctrines are not accepted by Mar Thoma church in their fullness. The Mar Thoma Church keeps a multifaceted approach in these relationships by adapting to the spiritual and cultural environment of the communions yet strongly abiding with the Mar Thoma Syrian identity. The Mar Thoma Church also keeps good ecumenical relations with other Christian churches around the world.

<text>Orin Gould Murfin (April 13, 1876 – October 22, 1956) was an admiral in the United States Navy.

Murfin served as the commanding officer of in 1916; , 1923–1925; and , 1928–29. During World War I, he supervised U.S. mine-laying bases in Scotland, for which he was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. From 1931 to 1934, Murfin was the Navy&#x27;s Judge Advocate General.

He also served as Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet, 1935–36. From there, Murfin became the commandant of the 14th Naval District, where he led the Navy&#x27;s participation in the search for Amelia Earhart when her plane went missing in 1937.

Born in Scioto County, Ohio, Murfin received his early education in Jackson, Ohio. He then attended the United States Naval Academy, graduating in 1897. Murfin served aboard the battleship during the Spanish–American War. He retired from active duty in May 1940.

Following his retirement, Murfin served as the President of the Navy Court of Inquiry following the attack on Pearl Harbor. The court&#x27;s conclusions were regarded as too lenient by Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal; see Edward C. Kalbfus.

Murfin and his wife Anna settled in Coronado, California, after his retirement. He died on October 22, 1956, at the Naval Hospital, Balboa Park in San Diego and was buried in Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery.

<doc id="1111694" wikidata="Q993884" url="?curid=1111694" title="St Mawes">
<text>St Mawes () is a village on the end of the Roseland Peninsula, in the eastern side of Falmouth harbour, on the south coast of Cornwall, England. The village, formerly two separate hamlets, lies on the east bank of the Carrick Roads, a large waterway created after the Ice Age from an ancient valley which flooded as the melt waters caused the sea level to rise. The immense natural harbour thus created is claimed to be the third largest in the world. St Mawes was once a busy fishing port, but the trade declined during the 20th century and the village now serves as a popular tourist location, with many properties functioning as holiday accommodation. The village is in the civil parish of St Just in Roseland and lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

==History and geography==
The village takes its name from the Celtic saint Saint Maudez (Mawe), who may have come from Ireland but is mainly venerated in Brittany. A name: &#x27;Musidum&#x27; in Roman times, has subsequently been applied to St. Mawes, although the source is dubious.

St Mawes was once an important town and was made a borough in 1563, returning two members to parliament. It was disfranchised in 1832. The town was described, in 1880, by an anonymous writer,

... as a quiet little fishing village, and consists of a long straggling street, fronting the water; it has, however a good pier, which was erected in 1854; and a sea-wall, with a parapet was built not long ago, along the centre front of the town&quot;.

St Mawes Castle is a well-preserved coastal fortress from the time of Henry VIII, built to counter the invasion threat from the Continent. Charles Henderson, writing in 1925, says of St Mawes, &quot;an ancient fishing town which in late years has assumed the different and more sophisticated character of a watering place&quot;. The seal of St Mawes was Az. a bend lozengy Or between a tower in the sinister chief Arg. and a ship with three masts the sail furled in the dexter base of the second, with the legend &quot;Commune Sigillum Burgi de St. Mawes al Mauditt.

===Royal family===

There have been frequent private visits to St Mawes by members of the royal family including Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and more recently Charles III and Queen Camilla, the then-Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, who ended their stay in July 2008 by naming the new St Mawes ferry &quot;The Duchess of Cornwall&quot;. The Queen visited St Mawes in 1977 during her Silver Jubilee Tour. In June 2002 for The Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee and, with a brand new cast in June 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee, The Queen&#x27;s Coronation was re-enacted in great detail by the young people of the village in a ceremony entitled &quot;The Children&#x27;s Coronation&quot;.

==Church history==

The name of the town comes from Saint Maudez, a Breton saint, and there was a chapel here dedicated to him with his holy well nearby. Its existence in 1427 is mentioned in George Oliver&#x27;s &quot;Monasticon&quot; and it remained in use until the reign of Elizabeth I when it was abandoned. From that time until &quot;ca&quot; 1838 there was no chapel for the townspeople until a private chapel built in 1807 by the Marquis of Buckingham was licensed by the Bishop. This was on a different site and was rebuilt in 1881. St Mawes continued however to be in the parish of St Just in Roseland. St Mawes&#x27; Church, St Mawes was opened in 1884. There is also a Methodist church, which was built in the first half of the 19th century and is a Grade II listed building.

==Demographics==
According to 2011 UK census data, 714 people lived in St Mawes. 91% of residents were born in UK and the most common religion stated was Christian (74.8%).

==Cultural associations==

The 1964 Agatha Christie film &quot;Murder Ahoy&quot; was filmed here, as was the 1964 film &quot;Crooks in Cloisters&quot;. Cormoran Strike, the protagonist of the eponymous detective novel series by Robert Galbraith, was raised in St. Mawes.

==Transport==

A year-round ferry provides a service to Falmouth, which is less than a mile away by boat, but due to its proximity to the Fal estuary it is some away by road. The Place Ferry links the South West Coast Path and operates from Good Friday to the end of October.

<text>Lindblad is an old lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the northwestern limb. This formation is located to the southeast of the crater Brianchon, and northeast of Cremona.

The fine detail along the rim of this crater has been worn down by a history of lesser impacts, leaving only a round-edged depression in the surface. The more recent impact Lindblad F intrudes slightly into the eastern rim, and several tiny craters lie along the northern and southwest rim. The interior surface is marked by a formation of adjacent craterlets just to the south and southwest of the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lindblad.

<text>Pillar of Salt is the name of a Grade II listed road sign on Angel Hill, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England. It was listed in 1998, when it was described as being &quot;individual and probably unique&quot;. According to the plaque set at the foot of the sign, it is thought to be the first internally illuminated road sign in the country. Designed by Basil Oliver, architect to Bury St. Edmunds Town Council in 1935, it had to be granted special permission because the height of the letters and numbers did not conform to regulations.

<text>Nishina is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the south-southwest of the crater Maksutov, to the southeast of Finsen and Leibniz.

The rim of this formation has been eroded, worn down, and reshaped by a history of impacts, leaving an irregular, indented perimeter surrounding the crater floor. The interior of the formation has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, leaving a level, nearly featureless surface that contains no impacts of note. While the interior surface has a low albedo and appears dark, it has been coated by ray material which has produced lighter patches to the southwest and northeast.

Prior to formal naming in 1970 by the IAU, the crater was known as &quot;Crater 436&quot;.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Nishina.

<doc id="1111713" wikidata="Q6047142" url="?curid=1111713" title="Interlochen, Michigan">
<text>Interlochen ( &quot;&quot;) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Grand Traverse County in the U.S. state of Michigan. At the 2020 census, the population was 694, up from 583 at the 2010 census. The community is located within Green Lake Township, and is home to a post office operating with ZIP Code 49643.

The community is home to the Interlochen Center for the Arts and also contains Interlochen State Park between the shores of Duck Lake and Green Lake. Interlochen is a designated Michigan State Historic Site.

==History==
Interlochen takes its name from the Latin &quot;inter&quot;, meaning &quot;between&quot;, and the Scottish Gaelic &quot;lochan&quot;, meaning lakes.

Before the arrival of European settlers, members of the Odawa people lived between the lakes they called &quot;Wahbekaness&quot; and &quot;Wahbekanetta&quot; (now named Duck Lake and Green Lake, respectively). Beginning in the late 19th century, European settlers began logging and fishing industries in the area, and founded the small village of Wylie, one mile south of present-day Interlochen. Because of logging, the Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad (owned by the Buckley and Douglas Lumber Company of Manistee) extended its line north from Nessen City and arrived between the lakes in the fall of 1889. Similarly, the Chicago and West Michigan Railway extended its line north from Baldwin on its way to Traverse City in 1890. The two lines crossed in current-day downtown Interlochen where a depot and interlocking tower were located. The original townsite, however, was platted just south of the depot along either side of the M&amp;NE rail line in late 1889 or early 1890, with the business district centering on the now-former M-137 and Riley Rd/10th Street.

As the lumber industry grew, the area became more deforested. However, it was predicted from the beginning that the area would become a popular summer resort, and so Buckley and Douglas set aside 186 acres of virgin pines between Duck and Green lakes for preservation. The result was Pine Park, a public retreat boasting virgin forests and pristine lakes. A small railroad depot named Pine Park Station was built. Visitors began flocking to the region during the warmer months to camp, fish, boat, and escape the heat of the crowded cities. Piggybacking on the vacation boom, local businessman Willis Pennington purchased land adjacent to Pine Park on the banks of Green Lake and opened the Pennington Hotel in 1909.

In the mid-1910s, local representatives became worried that Pine Park would soon be logged off and so they lobbied the Michigan Legislature for help. The state ultimately allocated $60,000 in 1917 to purchase the property, and the newly acquired parkland was dedicated as The Pines, later renamed Interlochen State Park, the first state park organized by the state of Michigan (Mackinac Island was originally a national park before becoming Michigan&#x27;s first state park in 1895).

In 1928, the National High School Orchestra Camp was founded by Joseph E. Maddy just south of Interlochen, and evolved to become Interlochen Center for the Arts, which includes a summer camp as well as an arts boarding high school and public radio station. The camp has expanded to both sides of J. Maddy Parkway (previously designated as a highway, M-137, in 1930 but decommissioned in 2020,), and enveloped the entire village of Wylie.

By the late 20th century, the railroads that brought students, vacationers, and lumber through Interlochen, had been removed. The north-south M&amp;NE railroad was removed in 1934, and the west-east C&amp;WM railroad (Pere Marquette Railway after 1899) removed in 1982. The area remains a popular vacation spot, with hiking, fishing, camping, boating, swimming, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling the most popular activities.

The community of Interlochen was listed as a newly organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time.

Interlochen is served by Traverse City&#x27;s public transportation system, the Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) which serves most of the Grand Traverse region with dial-a-ride services. BATA debuted its first hybrid bus in December 2005. BATA recently completed a bus transfer terminal on Hall Street in Traverse City, which opened July 21, 2006. The terminal is used to transfer riders to different buses on different routes. BATA also links riders to the Greyhound terminal for regional and long-distance travel.

Given the long dirt and gravel roads that cover much of Interlochen and its surrounding area, in 2011, BATA began an experimental transit program consisting of rentable skateboards, scooters, bicycles and cross country skis (only available during the winter seasons). The program is largely targeted at the area&#x27;s sizeable student population.

===General aviation===
* Green Lake Airport (Y88) is located three miles south of Interlochen.

<text>Biela is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged highlands of the southeastern Moon. It is named after Austrian astronomer Wilhelm von Biela. The crater lies to the east of Rosenberger, to the southeast of the Watt–Steinheil double crater.

The rim of this crater is overlaid by a pair of small but notable craters: Biela C across the northeast rim and Biela W along the western inner wall. The satellite crater Biela B is attached to the southwestern outer rim, and ejecta from Biela covers the northwestern part of the interior. Despite a certain degree of wear, the rim of Biela remains relatively well-defined, especially in the southeast.

The interior floor is flat and not marked by any craterlets of note. There is a central peak formation of three ridges located just to the northeast of the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Biela.

<text>Phillip Anthony Bardsley (born 28 June 1985) is a former professional footballer who played as a full back. He also played international football for the Scotland national team. He is currently assistant manager of Macclesfield.

Bardsley began his career with Manchester United where he made 18 appearances in five seasons at the club. During that time, he was loaned to several clubs, including Royal Antwerp, Burnley, Rangers, Aston Villa and Sheffield United.

He joined Sunderland in January 2008 for an initial fee of £850,000. Bardsley established himself as a regular at the Stadium of Light under Steve Bruce and Martin O&#x27;Neill and he won the player of the year award in 2010–11. He lost his place in the team in 2012–13 after a falling-out with manager Paolo Di Canio, before returning to the first team under Gus Poyet. Under Poyet, Bardsley helped Sunderland to avoid relegation in 2013–14 and reach the 2014 Football League Cup final, in which they lost 3–1 to Manchester City.

After his Sunderland contract expired in June 2014, Bardsley joined Stoke City on a free transfer. He spent three seasons with the club before joining Burnley in July 2017. Bardsley ended his career at Stockport County.

==Early life==
Born at Hope Hospital in Salford, Bardsley attended Hope High School along with former United teammates Mark Redshaw and Mark Howard. Bardsley started his career with Charlestown Lads Club also with Redshaw before signing for Manchester United. He grew up near Manchester United&#x27;s old training ground, The Cliff, and would often go there on his school holidays to watch the players train. Prior to his departure for Sunderland, he was the only current player who progressed through all the levels of the academy, starting out at the club at the age of 8.

==Club career==

===Manchester United===
After coming through the club&#x27;s youth system, Bardsley was a regular in Manchester United&#x27;s under-17 team from the 2000–01 season, before progressing to the under-19s from the 2002–03 season. He continued in the under-19s in 2003–04, but appeared more frequently in the reserves before making his first-team debut in a 2–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion on 3 December 2003 in the fourth round of the League Cup. He made a second appearance for the first team in the 3–0 FA Cup fourth round win over Northampton Town on 25 January 2004, before going on a four-month loan to Manchester United&#x27;s Belgian feeder club, Royal Antwerp, on 30 January. He made six appearances for Royal Antwerp, including a 4–0 defeat to Club Brugge on 8 February 2004, in which he was sent off for two bookable offences.

After returning to Manchester United at the end of 2003–04, Bardsley made three appearances on the club&#x27;s 2004–05 pre-season tour of the United States, playing against Bayern Munich, Celtic and Milan. He made another promising start to the 2005–06 season, and an injury to Gary Neville gave him plenty of opportunities to play between August and November 2005. He was regularly named as a substitute for much of the rest of the season, before going on loan to Championship club Burnley on 16 March 2006. He played six matches and scored an own goal in the first minute of a 1–1 draw at home to Southampton.

====Loan to Rangers====
Bardsley again made a significant contribution to Manchester United&#x27;s pre-season programme in 2006–07, but on 16 August, he was sent out on loan again, this time to Scottish Premier League club Rangers. On 9 September 2006, he scored his only goal for Rangers against Falkirk with a terrific long-range free kick. He was sent off against Hibernian, and therefore missed the Old Firm match against Celtic. On 17 October, it was reported that Bardsley was involved in a training ground disagreement with manager Paul Le Guen and his future at Rangers appeared to be in doubt. Indeed, Bardsley never played for Rangers again and returned to Manchester United in December.

====Loan to Aston Villa====
On 8 January 2007, Bardsley joined Aston Villa on loan until the end of the season and played his first Premier League match against Watford on 20 January. It was announced on 1 May that Bardsley would be returning to Manchester United when his loan deal with Villa ran out as manager Martin O&#x27;Neill did not want to make the move permanent.

====Loan to Sheffield United====
After playing what would turn out to be his last match for the Manchester United first team against Coventry City in the League Cup on 26 September 2007, it was confirmed on 15 October Bardsley would join Sheffield United on loan until January 2008. He made his full debut for the Blades a few days later in a 1–1 draw with Preston North End at Bramall Lane. Despite Sheffield United agreeing a deal with Manchester United to sign him permanently, Bardsley left at the end of his loan deal in January 2008 after playing 16 matches.

===Sunderland===

On 22 January 2008, Bardsley joined Sunderland on a three-and-a-half-year contract in a deal worth an initial £850,000, potentially rising to £2 million. He made his debut in a 2–0 win against Birmingham City in the Premier League on 29 January. Bardsley played 11 times under Roy Keane in 2007–08 as Sunderland successfully avoided relegation by three points. On 27 August 2008 Bardsley scored his first goal in English football in a 2–1 victory against Nottingham Forest in the League Cup. Bardsley lost out to Pascal Chimbonda during the first half of the 2008–09 campaign before regaining his place in the team in November 2008. He retained his place under Ricky Sbragia, playing in total 33 times in 2008–09 as Sunderland survived relegation on the final day of the season.
Bardsley kept his place under new manager Steve Bruce for the first half of the 2009–10 season until loan signing Alan Hutton took his place in February 2010. From there until the end of the campaign Bardsley was mainly used as a substitute and due his lack of playing time, Bardsley stated that he may have to consider leaving. However Hutton didn&#x27;t make his move permanent and Bardsley was able to reclaim his place in the side and in November 2010, he signed a new three-and-a-half-year deal running until summer 2014. He scored his first league goal against Aston Villa on 5 January 2011 with a 25-yard strike in a 1–0 win. He then scored his second of the season with another long range strike against Chelsea on 1 February 2012 in a 4–2 defeat. He scored another long-range goal on 9 April 2011 in a 3–2 defeat against West Bromwich Albion. In total Bardsley played 37 times in 2010–11 as the Black Cats finished in 10th position. Bardsley&#x27;s consistent performances during the campaign earned him the Player of the year award.

Bardsley made a poor start to the 2011–12 season as he was sent-off in a 1–0 defeat against rivals Newcastle United on 21 August 2011. He was then handed a retrospective four-match ban by the FA for an altercation Juan Mata in a 2–1 defeat by Chelsea on 10 September 2011. Despite this Bardsley retained his place in the side under Martin O&#x27;Neill, playing a total of 37 matches as Sunderland finished in 13th position. He missed the start of the 2012–13 campaign after undergoing ankle surgery in August 2012. Bardsley returned to the side at the end of October 2012, with the team struggling near the bottom of the table. Paolo Di Canio replaced O&#x27;Neill in March 2013 and he guided the team to back to back victories over Newcastle United and Everton lifting the club away from the relegation zone. Bardsley scored in the penultimate match of the season in a 1–1 draw with Southampton on 12 May 2013. Bardsley missed the final match of the season away at Tottenham Hotspur after he and Matthew Kilgallon were pictured visiting a casino, angering Di Canio who vowed never to play the pair again. Di Canio also fined Bardsley as well as six other Sunderland players for &quot;indiscipline&quot; which prompted an investigation by the PFA.

Bardsley began the 2013–14 season playing with the under-21s and whilst playing against Bolton Wanderers on 12 August 2013 he broke his foot ending Di Canio&#x27;s attempts to sell him. On 20 August 2013, Bardsley was suspended by Sunderland after mocking the club&#x27;s opening day defeat to Fulham on a social media site. His suspension was lifted on 4 September 2013 after he apologised. Di Canio was sacked and replaced by Gus Poyet in October 2013 and brought Bardsley back into the first-team. He made a poor start on his return, scoring an own goal in a 4–0 defeat away at Swansea City. His form improved thereafter scoring against Southampton in the League Cup and the only goal in a 1–0 win over Manchester City on 10 November 2013. He scored against his former club Manchester United in the 2nd leg of the League Cup semi-final as Sunderland progressed to the final on penalties. Bardsley played the full match of the 2014 Football League Cup final as Sunderland lost 3–1 to Manchester City. Bardsley played a total of 33 times in 2013–14 as Sunderland finished in 14th position.

===Stoke City===
With Bardsley&#x27;s Sunderland contract due to expire at the end of June 2014, other clubs were free to approach him from January 2014. On 22 May 2014, Bardsley signed a three-year contract with Stoke City. He made his Premier League debut for Stoke on the opening day of the 2014–15 season in a 1–0 defeat against Aston Villa. Bardsley established himself as a regular under Mark Hughes but struggled with discipline, picking up nine yellow cards by March 2015. Bardsley played 30 times for Stoke in the 2014–15 season as Stoke finished in 9th position.

Bardsley lost his place in the Stoke squad for the 2015–16 season following the arrival of Glen Johnson from Liverpool. Despite missing out on league appearances Bardsley played a part in Stoke&#x27;s League Cup campaign. He was sent-off in the fourth round against Chelsea and scored a 30-yard free kick in the quarter-final victory over Sheffield Wednesday. Following injury to Johnson in February, Bardsley took his place back in the side until the end of the season. He made 17 appearances for Stoke in 2015–16 as Stoke again finished in 9th position.

Bardsley scored a rare goal in a 4–0 EFL Cup victory over Stevenage on 23 August 2016. He suffered a knee injury on November which ruled him out for three months. He returned to the side in February but after getting sent-off against Chelsea on 18 March 2017 he was unable to get back into the team. Speaking in April 2017 Bardsley revealed that he is in limbo over whether he will be offered a new contract. Bardsley played 16 times in 2016–17 as Stoke finished in 13th position. He signed a contract extension with Stoke on 26 May 2017.

===Burnley===
On 25 July 2017, Bardsley completed a transfer to Premier League club Burnley, signing a two-year contract.

On 7 March 2021, Bardsley agreed a new one-year contract with Burnley, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2022. On 10 June 2022, Burnley announced that Bardsley would be leaving the club when his contract expired at the end of June.

===Stockport County===
On 13 December 2022, Bardsley signed for EFL League Two club Stockport County having been training with the club for the six months prior as he looked to return from injury. The move saw Bardsley agreeing to donate the entirety of his salary to the club&#x27;s community trust.

On 27 June 2023, Bardsley announced he had called an end to his playing career.

==International career==
On 6 October 2010, Bardsley received a call-up for the Scotland national team for the Euro 2012 qualifier against the Czech Republic on 8 October 2010. He qualifies because his father was born in Glasgow. He made his debut on 11 October 2010 in a 3–2 defeat by World and European champions Spain, filling in for the injured Alan Hutton.

<doc id="1111723" wikidata="Q2294780" url="?curid=1111723" title="Chicago III">
<text>Chicago III is the third studio album by the American rock band Chicago. It was released on January 11, 1971, through Columbia Records. The album was produced by James William Guercio and was the band&#x27;s third consecutive double album in less than two years.

Much like the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Chicago&quot; (many times referred to as &quot;Chicago II&quot;), &quot;Chicago III&quot; is made up of both multi-part suites and more conventional individual songs. The album saw the band integrate a number of different genres including folk and country (&quot;What Else Can I Say&quot;, &quot;Flight 602&quot;), free improvisation (&quot;Free Country&quot;), and musique concrète (&quot;Progress?&quot;) into their sound, while also continuing in their trademark jazz-rock style.

&quot;Chicago III&quot; was a critical and commercial success. It peaked at number two in the US, their highest chart placement at that point, and received positive reviews. While neither of its singles (&quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Lowdown&quot;) matched the success of the band&#x27;s previous and following singles, both managed to make the top 40, peaking at numbers 20 and 35, respectively. After the release of the album, Chicago would perform at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. Performances from this run would be released on the following album, &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot;.

== Background ==
In the wake of the enormous worldwide success of their second album, Chicago spent almost all of 1970 on the road, an exhausting undertaking. Former drummer Danny Seraphine, described the members of the band as &quot;fatigued and road-weary&quot; when they went into the studio to record the album.

Released in January 1971, initially on Columbia Records, &quot;Chicago III&quot; — the band&#x27;s first album to sport a Roman numeral in its title — sold well upon its release and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) a month later. It provided Chicago with its highest charting disc yet in the US, going to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Free&quot;, written by Robert Lamm, made it into the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and &quot;Lowdown&quot;, co-written by Peter Cetera and Danny Seraphine, reached the top 40. &quot;Chicago III&quot; marked a dwindling in UK fortunes in comparison to the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;, reaching No. 9 in a brief chart run.

In 1974, jazz bandleader Stan Kenton added a suite of songs from the album (&quot;Canon&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and &quot;Free&quot;) to his band&#x27;s repertoire, releasing it on the album &quot;Stan Kenton Plays Chicago.&quot;

== Musical style, writing, composition ==

The band had used up its storehouse of original material on its first two albums. It needed new material for &quot;Chicago III&quot;, and the songwriters worked &quot;nonstop&quot; Danny Seraphine said the band &quot;took the opportunity to experiment with instrumentals and showcase our skills as musicians.&quot;

Their long hours on the road gave the principal songwriters, Robert Lamm, Terry Kath and James Pankow, much food for thought, resulting in more serious subject matter, which contrasted with the positivity of their first two sets. In his retrospective review of the album, Jeff Giles writes that Lamm&#x27;s &quot;Travel Suite&quot; was &quot;inspired by the boredom, loneliness, and beauty of the road,&quot; and characterizes Pankow&#x27;s &quot;Elegy&quot; suite is an &quot;ecologically minded composition&quot; (an issue Lamm also touches upon in &quot;Mother&quot;). While Kath&#x27;s multi-part &quot;An Hour in the Shower&quot; provides a reprieve from the sobering explorations elsewhere, &quot;Chicago III&quot; was undeniably the result of a band who had seen the flip side of the world over the last several months. &quot;Lowdown&quot;, co-written by Peter Cetera and Danny Seraphine, was Seraphine&#x27;s first co-writing credit, and he was appreciative of the support Cetera gave him during the writing process.

&quot;Chicago III&quot; incorporates a variety of musical styles. &quot;Sing a Mean Tune Kid&quot; features the influence of funk, &quot;What Else Can I Say&quot; and &quot;Flight 602&quot; have a country feel, while abstract qualities are found in &quot;Free Country&quot; and &quot;Progress?&quot;.

== Recording and production ==
The album was produced by James William Guercio, who was Chicago&#x27;s producer for its first eleven albums. This album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. In 2002, &quot;Chicago III&quot; was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records.

== Artwork and packaging ==
The album cover design is titled &quot;Tattered Flag&quot; on the band&#x27;s website. Included with the album was a poster of the band dressed in the uniforms of America&#x27;s wars, standing in front of a field of crosses, representing those who had died in the still ongoing Vietnam War. It also gave the number of casualties from each war up until the time of the album&#x27;s release.

<text>The Torajan are an ethnic group indigenous to a mountainous region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Their population is approximately 1,100,000, of whom 450,000 live in the regency of Tana Toraja (&quot;Land of Toraja&quot;). Most of the population is Christian, and others are Muslim or have local animist beliefs known as &quot;aluk&quot; (&quot;the way&quot;). The Indonesian government has recognised this animistic belief as &quot;Aluk To Dolo&quot; (&quot;Way of the Ancestors&quot;) as well as &quot;Hindu Alukta&quot;, namely, a form of Hinduism in Indonesia.

The word &quot;Toraja&quot; comes from the Buginese language term &quot;to riaja&quot;, meaning &quot;people of the uplands&quot;, this cognates with the Toraja language &quot;to&quot; &quot;raya&quot;/&quot;to&quot; &quot;raja&quot;/&quot;to raa&quot; which also means &quot;inland/upland people&quot; or &quot;northern people&quot;. The Dutch colonial government named the people &quot;Toraja&quot; in 1909. Torajans are renowned for their elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as &quot;tongkonan&quot;, and colourful wood carvings. Toraja funeral rites are important social events, usually attended by hundreds of people and lasting for several days.

Before the 20th century, Torajans lived in autonomous villages, where they practised animism and were relatively untouched by the outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened to the outside world in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. In 1977, Hinduism was introduced to the Torajans by a mission from Bali, in which thousands of Torajans converted to Hinduism. That number has been increasing sharply since then. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.

== Ethnic identity ==
The Torajan people had little notion of themselves as a distinct ethnic group before the 20th century. Before Dutch colonisation and Christianisation, Torajans, who lived in highland areas, identified with their villages and did not share a broad sense of identity. Although complexes of rituals created linkages between highland villages, there were variations in dialects, differences in social hierarchies, and an array of ritual practices in the Sulawesi highland region. &quot;Toraja&quot; (from the coastal languages&#x27; &quot;to&quot;, meaning people; and &quot;riaja&quot;, uplands) was first used as a lowlander expression for highlanders. As a result, &quot;Toraja&quot; initially had more currency with outsiders—such as the Bugis and Makassarese, who constitute a majority of the lowland of Sulawesi—than with insiders. The Dutch missionaries&#x27; presence in the highlands gave rise to the Toraja ethnic consciousness in the Sa&#x27;dan Toraja region, and this shared identity grew with the rise of tourism in the Tana Toraja Regency. Since then, South Sulawesi has four main ethnic groups—the Bugis (the majority, including shipbuilders and seafarers), the Makassarese (lowland traders and seafarers), the Mandarese (traders and fishermen), and the Toraja (highland rice cultivators).

== History ==
From the 17th century, the Dutch established trade and political control on Sulawesi through the Dutch East Indies Company. Over two centuries, they ignored the mountainous area in central Sulawesi, where Torajans lived, because access was difficult and it had little productive agricultural land. In the late 19th century, the Dutch became increasingly concerned about the spread of Islam in the south of Sulawesi, especially among the Makassarese and Bugis peoples. The Dutch saw the animist highlanders as potential Christians. In the 1920s, the Reformed Missionary Alliance of the Dutch Reformed Church began missionary work aided by the Dutch colonial government. In addition to introducing Christianity, the Dutch abolished slavery and imposed local taxes. A line was drawn around the Sa&#x27;dan area and called &quot;Tana Toraja&quot; (&quot;the land of Toraja&quot;). Tana Toraja was first a subdivision of the Luwu kingdom that had claimed the area. In 1946, the Dutch granted Tana Toraja a &quot;regentschap&quot;, and it was recognised in 1957 as one of the regencies of Indonesia.
Early Dutch missionaries faced strong opposition among Torajans, especially among the elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, where they could be more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.

In the 1930s, Muslim lowlanders attacked the Torajans, resulting in widespread Christian conversion among those who sought to align themselves with the Dutch for political protection and to form a movement against the Bugis and Makassarese Muslims. Between 1951 and 1965 (following Indonesian independence), southern Sulawesi faced a turbulent period as the Darul Islam separatist movement fought for an Islamic state in Sulawesi. The 15 years of guerrilla warfare led to massive conversions to Christianity.

Alignment with the Indonesian government, however, did not guarantee safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen to belong to one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (&quot;aluk&quot;) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make &quot;aluk&quot; accord with the law, it had to be accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, &quot;Aluk To Dolo&quot; (&quot;the way of ancestors&quot;) was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.

== Society ==
There are three main types of affiliation in Toraja society: family, class and religion.

=== Family affiliation ===

Family is the primary social and political grouping in Torajan society. Each village is one extended family, the seat of which is the &quot;tongkonan&quot;, a traditional Torajan house. Each &quot;tongkonan&quot; has a name, which becomes the name of the village. The familial dons maintain village unity. Marriage between distant cousins (fourth cousins and beyond) is a common practice that strengthens kinship. Toraja society prohibits marriage between close cousins (up to and including the third cousin)—except for nobles, to prevent the dispersal of property. Kinship is actively reciprocal, meaning that the extended family helps each other farm, share buffalo rituals, and pay off debts.

Each person belongs to both the mother&#x27;s and the father&#x27;s families, the only bilateral family line in Indonesia. Children, therefore, inherit household affiliation from both mother and father, including land and even family debts. Children&#x27;s names are given on the basis of kinship, and are usually chosen after dead relatives. Names of aunts, uncles and cousins are commonly referred to in the names of mothers, fathers and siblings.

Before the start of the formal administration of Toraja villages by the Tana Toraja Regency, each Toraja village was autonomous. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (&quot;tongkonan&quot;), practically signed by the exchange of water buffalo and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person&#x27;s place in a social hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each person could or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one&#x27;s share.

=== Class affiliation ===

In early Toraja society, family relationships were tied closely to social class. There were three strata: nobles, commoners, and slaves (slavery was abolished in 1909 by the Dutch East Indies government). Class was inherited through the mother. It was taboo, therefore, to marry &quot;down&quot; with a woman of lower class. On the other hand, marrying a woman of higher class could improve the status of the next generation. The nobility&#x27;s condescending attitude toward the commoners is still maintained today for reasons of family prestige.

Nobles, who were believed to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven, lived in &quot;tongkonans&quot;, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called &quot;banua&quot;). Slaves lived in small huts, which had to be built around their owner&#x27;s &quot;tongkonan&quot;. Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to marry in-family to maintain their status. Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some social mobility, as marriage or change in wealth could affect an individual&#x27;s status. Wealth was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.

Slaves in Toraja society were family property. Sometimes Torajans decided to become slaves when they incurred a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. Slaves could buy their freedom, but their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime punishable by death.

=== Religious affiliation ===
Toraja&#x27;s indigenous belief system is polytheistic animism, called &quot;aluk&quot;, or &quot;the way&quot; (sometimes translated as &quot;the law&quot;). In the Toraja myth, the ancestors of Torajan people came down from heaven using stairs, which were then used by the Torajans as a communication medium with &quot;Puang Matua&quot;, the Creator. The cosmos, according to &quot;aluk&quot;, is divided into the upper world (heaven), the world of man (earth), and the underworld. At first, heaven and earth were married, then there was a darkness, a separation, and finally the light. Animals live in the underworld, which is represented by rectangular space enclosed by pillars, the earth is for mankind, and the heaven world is located above, covered with a saddle-shaped roof. Other Toraja gods include &quot;Pong Banggai di Rante&quot; (god of Earth), &quot;Indo&#x27; Ongon-Ongon&quot; (a goddess who can cause earthquakes), &quot;Pong Lalondong&quot; (god of death), and &quot;Indo&#x27; Belo Tumbang&quot; (goddess of medicine); there are many more.

The earthly authority, whose words and actions should be cleaved to both in life (agriculture) and death (funerals), is called &quot;to minaa&quot; (an &quot;aluk&quot; priest). &quot;Aluk&quot; is not just a belief system; it is a combination of law, religion, and habit. &quot;Aluk&quot; governs social life, agricultural practices, and ancestral rituals. The details of &quot;aluk&quot; may vary from one village to another. One common law is the requirement that death and life rituals be separated. Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with life rituals. The two rituals are equally important.

The decline of the Toraja religion began with the Christianization under rule of the Dutch. During the time of the Dutch missionaries, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing life rituals, but were allowed to perform death rituals. Consequently, Toraja&#x27;s death rituals are still practised today, while life rituals have diminished.
The traditional Toraja religion is today only practiced by a small minority.

== Culture ==

=== Tongkonan ===


Tongkonan are the traditional Torajan ancestral houses. They stand high on wooden piles, topped with a layered split-bamboo roof shaped in a sweeping curved arc, and they are incised with red, black, and yellow detailed wood carvings on the exterior walls. The word &quot;tongkonan&quot; comes from the Torajan &quot;tongkon&quot; (&quot;to sit&quot;).

Tongkonan are the center of Torajan social life. The rituals associated with the tongkonan are important expressions of Torajan spiritual life, and therefore all family members are impelled to participate, because symbolically the &quot;tongkonan&quot; represents links to their ancestors and to living and future kin. According to Torajan myth, the first &quot;tongkonan&quot; was built in heaven on four poles, with a roof made of Indian cloth. When the first Torajan ancestor descended to earth, he imitated the house and held a large ceremony.

The construction of a tongkonan is laborious work and is usually done with the help of the extended family. There are three types of &quot;tongkonan&quot;. The &quot;tongkonan layuk&quot; is the house of the highest authority, used as the &quot;center of government&quot;. The &quot;tongkonan pekamberan&quot; belongs to the family members who have some authority in local traditions. Ordinary family members reside in the &quot;tongkonan batu&quot;. The exclusivity to the nobility of the &quot;tongkonan&quot; is diminishing as many Torajan commoners find lucrative employment in other parts of Indonesia. As they send back money to their families, they enable the construction of larger &quot;tongkonan&quot;.

Architecture in the style of a tongkonan is still very common. Various administration buildings were built in this style in recent years, e.g. the &quot;Kecamatan&quot; building in Rantepao.

=== Wood carvings ===

To express social and religious concepts, Torajans carve wood, calling it &quot;Pa&#x27;ssura&quot; (or &quot;the writing&quot;). Wood carvings are therefore Toraja&#x27;s cultural manifestation.

Each carving receives a special name, and common motifs are animals and plants that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. Torajan wood carvings are composed of numerous square panels, each of which can represent various things, for example buffaloes as a wish of wealth for the family; a knot and a box, symbolizing the hope that all of the family&#x27;s offspring will be happy and live in harmony; aquatic animals, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water.

Regularity and order are common features in Toraja wood carving (see table below), as well as abstracts and geometrical designs. Nature is frequently used as the basis of Toraja&#x27;s ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering. Toraja&#x27;s ornaments have been studied in ethnomathematics to reveal their mathematical structure, but Torajans base this art only on approximations. To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a geometrical tool.

On 24 March 2022, about 125 patterns were given communal intellectual property copyright sertificates by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, in order for protecting of traditional culture expressions.

=== Funeral rites ===
In Toraja society, the funeral ritual is the most elaborate and expensive event. The richer and more powerful the individual, the more expensive is the funeral. In the &quot;aluk&quot; religion, only nobles have the right to have an extensive death feast. The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called &quot;rante&quot;, is usually prepared in a large, grassy field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased&#x27;s family. Flute music, funeral chants, songs and poems, and crying and wailing are traditional Toraja expressions of grief with the exceptions of funerals for young children, and poor, low-status adults.

The ceremony is often held weeks, months, or years after the death so that the deceased&#x27;s family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward &quot;Puya&quot; (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, the body of the deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the &quot;tongkonan&quot;. The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral ceremony is completed, after which it begins its journey to &quot;Puya&quot;.


Another component of the ritual is the slaughter of water buffalo. The more powerful the person who died, the more buffalo are slaughtered at the death feast. Buffalo carcasses, including their heads, are usually lined up on a field waiting for their owner, who is in the &quot;sleeping stage&quot;. Torajans believe that the deceased will need the buffalo to make the journey and that they will be quicker to arrive at &quot;Puya&quot; if they have many buffalo. Slaughtering tens of water buffalo and hundreds of pigs using a machete is the climax of the elaborate death feast, with dancing and music and young boys who catch spurting blood in long bamboo tubes. Some of the slaughtered animals are given by guests as &quot;gifts&quot;, which are carefully noted because they will be considered debts of the deceased&#x27;s family. However, a cockfight, known as bulangan londong, is an integral part of the ceremony. As with the sacrifice of the buffalo and the pigs, the cockfight is considered sacred because it involves the spilling of blood on the earth. In particular, the tradition requires the sacrifice of at least three chickens. However, it is common for at least 25 pairs of chickens to be set against each other in the context of the ceremony.

There are three methods of burial: the coffin may be laid in a cave or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It contains any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes a few months to complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large enough to accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called &quot;Tau tau&quot;, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. Whilst a coffin of a baby is embedded into a burrow of a living tree, so called &quot;baby tree&quot;.

In the ritual called &quot;Ma&#x27;Nene&quot;, that takes place each year in August, the bodies of the deceased are exhumed to be washed, groomed and dressed in new clothes.

=== Dance and music ===

Torajans perform dances on several occasions, most often during their elaborate funeral ceremonies. They dance to express their grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because he is going to have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called &quot;Ma&#x27;badong&quot;). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the &quot;Ma&#x27;randing&quot; warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The &quot;Ma&#x27;randing&quot; dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the &quot;rante&quot;, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the &quot;Ma&#x27;katia&quot; dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The &quot;Ma&#x27;akatia&quot; dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called &quot;Ma&#x27;dondan&quot;.

As in other agricultural societies, Torajans dance and sing during harvest time. The &quot;Ma&#x27;bugi&quot; dance celebrates the thanksgiving event, and the &quot;Ma&#x27;gandangi&quot; dance is performed while Torajans are pounding rice. There are several war dances, such as the &quot;Manimbong&quot; dance performed by men, followed by the &quot;Ma&#x27;dandan&quot; dance performed by women. The &quot;aluk&quot; religion governs when and how Torajans dance. A dance called &quot;Ma&#x27;bua&quot; can be performed only once every 12 years. &quot;Ma&#x27;bua&quot; is a major Toraja ceremony in which priests wear a buffalo head and dance around a sacred tree.

A traditional musical instrument of the Toraja is a bamboo flute called a &quot;Pa&#x27;suling&quot; (&quot;suling&quot; is an Indonesian word for flute). This six-holed flute (not unique to the Toraja) is played at many dances, such as the thanksgiving dance &quot;Ma&#x27;bondensan&quot;, where the flute accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. The Toraja have indigenous musical instruments, such as the &quot;Pa&#x27;pelle&quot; (made from palm leaves) and the &quot;Pa&#x27;karombi&quot; (the Torajan version of a jaw harp). The &quot;Pa&#x27;pelle&quot; is played during harvest time and at house inauguration ceremonies.

=== Cogender views ===
Among the Saʼadan (eastern Toraja) in the island of Sulawesi (Celebes), Indonesia, there are homosexual male toburake tambolang shamans; although among their neighbors the Mamasa (western Toraja) there are instead only heterosexual female toburake shamanesses.

== Language ==

The ethnic Toraja language is dominant in Tana Toraja with the main language as the Sa&#x27;dan Toraja. Although the national Indonesian language is the official language and is spoken in the community, all elementary schools in Tana Toraja teach Toraja language.

Language varieties of Toraja, including &quot;Kalumpang&quot;, &quot;Mamasa&quot;, &quot;Tae&quot;, &quot;Talondo&quot;, &quot;Toala&quot;, and &quot;Toraja-Sa&#x27;dan&quot;, belong to the Malayo-Polynesian language from the Austronesian family. At the outset, the isolated geographical nature of Tana Toraja formed many dialects between the Toraja languages themselves. After the formal administration of Tana Toraja, some Toraja dialects have been influenced by other languages through the transmigration program, introduced since the colonialism period, and it has been a major factor in the linguistic variety of Toraja languages.

A prominent attribute of Toraja language is the notion of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.

== Economy ==

Prior to Suharto&#x27;s &quot;New Order&quot; administration, the Torajan economy was based on agriculture, with cultivated wet rice in terraced fields on mountain slopes, and supplemental cassava and maize crops. Much time and energy were devoted to raising water buffalo, pigs, and chickens, primarily for ceremonial sacrifices and consumption. Coffee was the first significant cash crop produced in Toraja, and was introduced in the mid 19th century, changing the local economy towards commodity production for external markets and gaining an excellent reputation for quality in the international market.

With the commencement of the New Order in 1965, Indonesia&#x27;s economy developed and opened to foreign investment. In Toraja, a coffee plantation and factory was established by Key Coffee of Japan, and Torajan coffee regained a reputation for quality within the growing international specialty coffee sector Multinational oil and mining companies opened new operations in Indonesia during the 1970s and 1980s. Torajans, particularly younger ones, relocated to work for the foreign companies—to Kalimantan for timber and oil, to Papua for mining, to the cities of Sulawesi and Java, and many went to Malaysia. The out-migration of Torajans was steady until 1985. and has continued since, with remittances sent back by emigrant Torajans performing an important role within the contemporary economy.

Tourism commenced in Toraja in the 1970s, and accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s. Between 1984 and 1997, a significant number of Torajans obtained their incomes from tourism, working in and owning hotels, as tour guides, drivers, or selling souvenirs. With the rise of political and economic instability in Indonesia in the late 1990s—including religious conflicts elsewhere on Sulawesi—tourism in Tana Toraja has declined dramatically. Toraja continues to be a well known origin for Indonesian coffee, grown by both smallholders and plantation estates, although migration, remittances and off-farm income is considered far more important to most households, even those in rural areas.

==Tourism and cultural change==
Before the 1970s, Western tourism was almost unknown in the Toraja highland area. In 1971, about 50 Europeans visited Tana Toraja. In 1972, at least 400 visitors attended the funeral ritual of Puang of Sangalla, the highest-ranking nobleman in Tana Toraja and the so-called &quot;last pure-blooded Toraja noble.&quot; The event was documented by &quot;National Geographic&quot; and broadcast in several European countries. In 1976, about 12,000 tourists visited the regency and in 1981, Torajan sculpture was exhibited in major North American museums. &quot;The land of the heavenly kings of Tana Toraja&quot;, as written in the exhibition brochure, embraced the outside world.

In 1984, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism declared Tana Toraja Regency the &quot;prima donna&quot; of South Sulawesi. Tana Toraja was heralded as &quot;the second stop after Bali&quot;. Tourism was increasing dramatically: by 1985, a total number of 150,000 foreigners had visited the Regency (in addition to 80,000 domestic tourists), and the annual number of foreign visitors was recorded at 40,000 in 1989. Souvenir stands appeared in Rantepao, the cultural center of Toraja, roads were sealed at the most-visited tourist sites, new hotels and tourist-oriented restaurants were opened, and an airstrip was opened in the Regency in 1981.

Tourism developers marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure—an area rich in culture and off-the-beaten-track. Toraja was marketed for tourists who had gone as far as Bali and were interested in seeing more of the wild, &quot;untouched&quot; islands. Western tourists expected to see stone-age villages and pagan funerals. However, they were more likely to see Christian Torajans wearing NBA sports caps and denim. Tourists felt that the &quot;tongkonan&quot; and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived to make profits, and complained that the destination was too commercialised. This resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.

A clash between local Torajan leaders and the South Sulawesi provincial government (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their &quot;tongkonans&quot; and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.

Tourism has also transformed Toraja society. Originally, there was a ritual which allowed commoners to marry nobles (&quot;puang&quot;) and thereby gain nobility for their children. However, the image of Torajan society created for the tourists, often by non-aristocratic guides, has eroded its traditional strict hierarchy. High status is not as esteemed in Tana Toraja as it once was. Many low-ranking men can declare themselves and their children nobles by gaining enough wealth through work outside the region and then marrying a noble woman.

<text>Sippie Wallace (born Beulah Belle Thomas; November 1, 1898 – November 1, 1986) was an American blues singer, pianist and songwriter. Her early career in tent shows gained her the billing &quot;The Texas Nightingale&quot;. Between 1923 and 1927, she recorded over 40 songs for Okeh Records, many written by her or her brothers, George and Hersal Thomas. Her accompanists included Louis Armstrong, Johnny Dodds, Sidney Bechet, King Oliver, and Clarence Williams. Among the top female blues vocalists of her era, Wallace ranked with Ma Rainey, Ida Cox, Alberta Hunter, and Bessie Smith.

In the 1930s, she left show business to become a church organist, singer, and choir director in Detroit and performed secular music only sporadically until the 1960s, when she resumed her performing career. Wallace was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1982 and was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Early life==
Wallace was born in the Delta lowlands of Jefferson County, Arkansas, one of 13 children in her family. Wallace came from a musical family: her brother George Washington Thomas became a notable pianist, bandleader, composer, and music publisher; a brother Hersal Thomas, was a pianist and composer; her niece Hociel Thomas (George&#x27;s daughter) was a pianist and composer.

When she was a child her family moved to Houston, Texas. In her youth she sang and played the piano in Shiloh Baptist Church, where her father was a deacon, but in the evenings she and her siblings took to sneaking out to tent shows. By the time she was in her mid-teens, they were playing in those tent shows. Performing in various Texas shows, she built a solid following as a spirited blues singer.

In 1915, Wallace moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, with Hersal. Two years later she married Matt Wallace and took his surname.

==Career==

Wallace followed her brothers to Chicago in 1923 and worked her way into the city&#x27;s bustling jazz scene. Her reputation led to a recording contract with Okeh Records in 1923. Her first recorded songs, &quot;Shorty George&quot; and &quot;Up the Country Blues&quot;, the former written with her brother George, sold well enough to make her a blues star in the early 1920s. Other successful recordings followed, including &quot;Special Delivery Blues&quot; (with Louis Armstrong), &quot;Bedroom Blues&quot; (written by George and Hersal Thomas), and &quot;I&#x27;m a Mighty Tight Woman&quot;. Hersal Thomas died of food poisoning in 1926, at age 19.

Wallace moved to Detroit in 1929. Matt Wallace died in 1936 and George Thomas Washington died on March 6, 1937.

For some 40 years, Wallace was a singer and organist at the Leland Baptist Church in Detroit. Mercury Records reissued &quot;Bedroom Blues&quot; in 1945. Aside from an occasional performance or recording date, she did little in the blues until she launched a comeback in 1966, after her longtime friend Victoria Spivey coaxed her out of retirement, and Wallace toured on the folk and blues festival circuit.

Wallace recorded an album, &quot;Women Be Wise&quot;, on October 31, 1966, in Copenhagen, Denmark, with Roosevelt Sykes and Little Brother Montgomery playing the piano. She recorded another album in 1966, &quot;Sings the Blues&quot;, on which she accompanied herself on piano on the title song, with Sykes or Montgomery playing piano on other tracks. Both albums include her signature song, &quot;Women Be Wise&quot;. These recordings helped inspire the musician Bonnie Raitt to take up singing and playing the blues in the late 1960s. Raitt recorded renditions of &quot;Women Be Wise&quot; and &quot;Mighty Tight Woman&quot; on her self-titled debut album in 1971. Wallace toured and recorded with Raitt in the 1970s and 1980s and continued to perform on her own. The duo performed the song &quot;Woman Be Wise&quot; on Late Night with David Letterman on April 27, 1982, with Dr. John accompanying on piano, in support of her album &quot;Sippie&quot;.

Wallace contributed to Louis Armstrong&#x27;s album &quot;Louis Armstrong and the Blues Singers&quot; (1966), singing &quot;A Jealous Woman Like Me&quot;, &quot;Special Delivery Blues&quot;, &quot;Jack o&#x27;Diamond Blues&quot;, &quot;The Mail Train Blues&quot; and &quot;I Feel Good&quot;. She and Spivey recorded an album of blues standards, &quot;Sippie Wallace and Victoria Spivey&quot;, released in 1970 by Spivey&#x27;s label, Spivey Records. In 1981, Wallace recorded the album &quot;Sippie&quot; for Atlantic Records, which earned her a 1983 Grammy nomination and won the 1982 W. C. Handy Award for Best Blues Album of the Year. Wallace&#x27;s backup group was pianist James Dapogny&#x27;s Chicago Jazz Band, consisting of Paul Klinger on cornet, Bob Smith on trombone and Russ Whitman and Peter Ferran on reeds.

She appeared at the Newport Folk Festival in 1966 and 1967, toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival in 1966, performed at the Chicago Blues Festival in 1967 and the Ann Arbor Blues Festival in 1972, and appeared at Lincoln Center in New York in 1977. She appeared in the 1982 documentary &quot;Jammin&#x27; with the Blues Greats&quot;. She shared the stage with B.B. King at the Montreaux Jazz Festival on July 22, 1982, in a performance that was filmed and later broadcast.

With the German boogie-woogie pianist Axel Zwingenberger she recorded a studio album, &quot;Axel Zwingenberger and the Friends of Boogie Woogie, Vol. 1: Sippie Wallace&quot;, in 1983 (released in 1984), which included many of her own groundbreaking compositions and other classic blues songs. In 1984 she traveled to Germany to tour with Zwingenberger, where they also recorded her only complete live album, &quot;An Evening with Sippie Wallace&quot;, for Vagabond Records.

==Death==
In March 1986, following a concert at the Burghausen Jazz Festival in Germany, Wallace suffered a severe stroke and was hospitalized. She returned to the United States and died on her 88th birthday, at Sinai Hospital in Detroit. She is buried at Trinity Cemetery, in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan.

==Documentary==
In 1986, Rhapsody Films and producer Roberta Grossman released the documentary &quot;Sippie Wallace: Blues Singer and Song Writer&quot;, in which Wallace is shown in concert footage, interviews, and photographs, with historic rare recordings.

<text>Corbeil-Essonnes () on the River Seine is a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris.

Although neighboring Évry is the official seat of the Arrondissement of Évry, the sub-prefecture building and administration are located inside the commune of Corbeil-Essonnes.

==History==
Traces of human presence in the area date to the Palaeolithic and Neolithic ages; later it was a Gallo-Roman settlement on the main road from Paris to Sens. The name Corbeil is derived from the Latin &quot;Corbulium&quot;, from the Gaulish &quot;cor beel&quot;, meaning &quot;holy house&quot;. Since the time of Aymon, comte de Corbeil (died 957), to the 12th century it was the chief town of a powerful county, which passed to Mauger, son of Richard I of Normandy.

William de Corbeil (died 1136) became archbishop of Canterbury, but nothing is known for certain about his parentage. The Gothic church was built in the tenth century and rebuilt in the fifteenth century. Before the expulsion of the Jews Corbeil had a flourishing Jewish community, which numbered thirteenth-century scholars Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil and Perez ben Elijah. Peter of Corbeil (died 1222) was the teacher of Lotario de&#x27; Conti, who became pope as Innocent III.

Representatives of the king of France signed two treaties of Corbeil in the town, the Treaty of Corbeil (1258) between France and Aragon and the Treaty of Corbeil (1326) between France and Scotland.

Corbeil was besieged by the Duke of Burgundy in 1418. The Protestants of France attacked it in 1562 amidst the religious war called the First Civil War. In 1590 General Alessandro Farnese, who had come to the assistance of the Catholics in France, fought at Corbeil.

The composer Camille Saint-Saëns lived in Corbeil for some years of his youth.

The commune of Corbeil-Essonnes was created on 10 August 1951 by the merger of the commune of Corbeil with the commune of Essonnes. The commune town hall (&quot;mairie&quot;) is located in Corbeil.

Inhabitants of Corbeil-Essonnes are known as &quot;Corbeil-Essonnois&quot;.

==Population==

The population data given in the table and graph below for 1946 and earlier refer to the former commune of Corbeil.

==Economy==

In the 19th century, Corbeil-Essonnes was a centre of the flour-milling industry. Essonnes also had notable papermills.

Today, X-Fab France SAS is headquartered here and operates a semiconductor fabrication plant. The site includes 25000 square meters of cleanrooms and a design center. The fab had been founded by IBM in 1964. In 1999 it was transferred into a joint venture between IBM and Infineon, operating under the name &quot;Altis Semiconductor&quot;(fr). In 2010 it was sold to Yazid Sabeg for one symbolic Euro. X-Fab acquired the assets of insolvent Altis in 2016.

Safran Aircraft Engines has a plant in Corbeil.

==Transport==
Corbeil-Essonnes is served by Corbeil-Essonnes station which is an interchange station on Paris RER line D. Corbeil-Essonnes is also served by Essonnes-Robinson station and by Moulin-Galant station on Paris RER line D.

The town is crossed by the EuroVelo 3 track.

<doc id="1111752" wikidata="Q255890" url="?curid=1111752" title="Maralinga">
<text>Maralinga is a desert area around large located in the west of South Australia, within the Great Victoria Desert. The area is best known for being the location of several British nuclear tests in the 1950s.

In January 1985, in recognition of their native title, freehold title was granted to the Maralinga Tjarutja, a southern Pitjantjatjara Aboriginal Australian people, over some land. Around the same time, the McClelland Royal Commission identified significant residual nuclear contamination at some sites. Under an agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Australia, efforts were made to clean up the site before the Maralinga people resettled on the land in 1995. The main community, which includes a school, is Oak Valley. There are still concerns that some of the ground is still contaminated, despite two attempts at cleanup.

==History==

===Nuclear tests and cleanup===

Maralinga was the scene of UK nuclear testing and was contaminated with radioactive waste in the 1950s and early 1960s. Maralinga was surveyed by Len Beadell in the early 1950s. It followed the survey of Emu Field, which was further north and where Operation Totem with two nuclear tests was conducted.

On 27 September 1956, Operation Buffalo commenced at Maralinga, as Emu Field was found to be excessively remote. The operation consisted of the testing of four fission bombs. Two were set atop towers, one at ground level, and one released by a Royal Air Force Vickers Valiant bomber from a height of . This was the first launching of a British atomic weapon from an aircraft.

Operation Antler followed in 1957. Antler was designed to test the triggering mechanisms of the weapons. Three tests began in September. The first two tests were conducted from towers; the last was suspended from balloons. Yields from the weapons were 1 kiloton, 6 kilotons and 25 kilotons respectively.

Participants in the test programme were prohibited from disclosing details of its undertakings. Risking incarceration, nuclear veteran Avon Hudson became a whistle-blower and spoke out to the media in the 1970s. His disclosures helped pave the way towards a public inquiry into the tests and their legacy.

The McClelland Royal Commission of 1984–1985 identified significant residual contamination at some sites. British and Australian servicemen were purposely exposed to fallout from the blasts, to study radiological effects. The local Aboriginal people have claimed they were poisoned by the tests and, in 1994, the Australian Government reached a compensation settlement with Maralinga Tjarutja of $13.5 million in settlement of all claims in relation to the nuclear testing. Previously many of these facts were kept from the public.

===1985 native title handback===
In January 1985, the land was handed over to the traditional owners, the Aboriginal people of the area (Aṉangu) who are a southern branch of the Pitjantjatjara people, under the &quot;Maralinga Tjarutja Land Rights Act 1984&quot;. They were granted freehold title, and the right to developmental funds from the State and Federal governments. They completed a move back into Oak Valley in March 1985, a new community approximately NNW of the original township of Maralinga.

Under an agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Australia in 1995, efforts were made to clean up the site, being completed in 1995. Tonnes of soil and debris contaminated with plutonium and uranium were buried in two trenches about deep. The effectiveness of the cleanup has been disputed on a number of occasions.

In 2003 South Australian Premier Mike Rann and Education Minister Trish White opened a new school at Oak Valley, replacing what had been described as the &quot;worst school in Australia&quot;.

==Contamination fears==

Despite the governments of Australia and the UK paying for two decontamination programmes, concerns have been expressed that some areas of the Maralinga test sites are still contaminated 10 years after being declared &quot;clean&quot;, as late as 2011.

It was found in 2021 that radioactive (&quot;hot&quot;) particles persist in the soil, after international multidisciplinary team of scientists studied the results produced by a machine at Monash University that is capable of slicing open tiny samples using a beam of high-energy ions only a nanometre wide. The analysis of the results suggested that natural processes in the desert environment could bring about the slow release of plutonium over a long period. This plutonium is likely to be absorbed by wildlife at Maralinga.

==Documentary film==
&quot;Maralinga Tjarutja&quot;, a May 2020 television documentary film directed by Larissa Behrendt and made by Blackfella Films for ABC Television, tells the story of the people of Maralinga. It was deliberately broadcast around the same time that the drama series &quot;Operation Buffalo&quot; was on, to give voice to the Indigenous people of the area and show how it disrupted their lives. Screenhub gave it 4.5 stars, calling it an &quot;excellent documentary&quot;. The film shows the resilience of the Maralinga Tjarutja people, in which the elders &quot;reveal a perspective of deep time and an understanding of place that generates respect for the sacredness of both&quot;, their ancestors having lived in the area for millennia. Despite the callous disregard for their occupation of the land shown by the British and Australians involved in the testing, the people have continued to fight for their rights to look after the contaminated land.

<doc id="1111756" wikidata="Q2140112" url="?curid=1111756" title="Runaways (comics)">
<text>Runaways is a superhero comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The series features a group of teenagers who discover that their parents are part of an evil crime organization known as &quot;the Pride&quot;. Created by Brian Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, the series debuted in July 2003 as part of Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Tsunami&quot; imprint. The series was canceled in September 2004 at issue #18, but due to high numbers of trade collection sales, Marvel revived the series in February 2005.

Originally, the series featured a group of six kids whose parents routinely met every year for a charity event. One year, the kids spy on their parents and learn they are &quot;the Pride&quot;, a criminal group of mob bosses, time-travelers, wizards, evil scientists, alien invaders and telepathic mutants. The kids steal weapons and resources from their parents and learn that they themselves inherited their parents&#x27; powers; Alex Wilder, a prodigy, leads the team while Nico Minoru learns she is a powerful witch, Karolina Dean discovers she is an alien, Gertrude Yorkes learns of her telepathic link to a dinosaur, Chase Stein steals his father&#x27;s fistigons (fire gauntlets) and x-ray goggles, and young Molly Hayes learns she is a mutant with incredible strength. The kids band together and defeat their parents and atone for the sins of their parents by fighting the new threats trying to fill in the Pride&#x27;s void. Later, they are joined by the cyborg Victor Mancha, the shape-shifting Skrull Xavin, and the plant-manipulator Klara Prast.

Since the original group&#x27;s introduction, the Runaways have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional yet loving family. Series creators Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona left the series at issue 24 of the title&#x27;s second volume, which ended at issue #30. The series was cancelled in November 2009 after issue #14 of Volume 3, but the characters have been seen in other comics. On September 1, 2017, Rainbow Rowell and Kris Anka revived the series, which ran for 38 issues.

A live-action adaptation of the series was in development for several years, leading to the &quot;Runaways&quot; television series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It debuted on Hulu in 2017.

==Publication history==

Series creator Brian K. Vaughan pitched &quot;Runaways&quot; in 2003 as a part of Marvel&#x27;s Tsunami imprint, the goal of which was to attract new readers, particularly young readers and the manga audience. Marvel editorial staff agreed to it immediately, prompting Wizard Magazine to name the series as &quot;one of the best original concepts from Marvel in thirty years.&quot; The Tsunami imprint turned out to be unsuccessful, and the series ended at issue #18. After the series&#x27; sales in digests, Vaughan pitched the idea again to Marvel, who accepted it.

Writer Brian K. Vaughan has claimed that he had only planned to write &quot;Runaways&quot; for six months/issues, but because of the popularity of the series and new ideas from Vaughan, Marvel decided to continue issuing it on a monthly basis. In 2007, Brian K. Vaughan announced his departure from &quot;Runaways&quot;, deciding to leave the series at the top of its game. Longtime &quot;Runaways&quot;-fan Joss Whedon was hand-picked by Vaughan to write an arc and finish the second volume; although Whedon had declined at first, he later accepted.

In 2008, writer Terry Moore, alongside artist Humberto Ramos became the new creative team for the third volume. In Blair Butler&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Ink&quot; segment on the cable television station G4 show &quot;Attack of the Show&quot; Marvel revealed that Kathryn Immonen and Sarah Pichelli were the new creative team. They began with issue #11 of Volume 3, which will &quot;start with a prom and end with a death&quot;; Marvel editor Nick Lowe said that &quot;It feels so right and so wrong at the same time? To be honest, and no offense to Joss or Terry, I hadn&#x27;t felt this way since Gert died.&quot; The story ended with a major cliffhanger that was resolved in other comics.

After three years, the Runaways returned in the story arc &quot;Pride Comes Before It&quot;, in issues 17 to 19 of &quot;&quot;. They appeared in &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; #27–28. Since then, Victor Mancha became a regular character in the robot-themed comic Avengers A.I., while Nico Minoru and Chase Stein became part of the cast in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;, and its sequel &quot;Avengers Undercover&quot;.

In February 2015, it was announced that a new &quot;Runaways&quot; series would be launching during Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; crossover written by ND Stevenson and drawn by Sanford Greene, featuring a new cast set on Battleworld. The lineup of the new team included Molly Hayes and a team of all new members. Additionally, Nico Minoru was featured in &quot;A-Force&quot;. Nico was also used on a second run of A-Force, this time based in the mainstream Marvel Universe, but was cancelled after ten issues.

In May 2017, Marvel released teasers with the characters of the Runaways. In June 2017, it was announced that Marvel would release a new Runaways series written by Rainbow Rowell, and illustrated by Kris Anka. The new series was released in September 2017. In August 2021, Marvel celebrated the title&#x27;s 100 issues with co-creator Adrian Alphona returning for a special giant-sized &quot;Runaways&quot; #38, final issue of Rowell&#x27;s run. In 2023, a six-issue arc resolving one of the cliffhangers from that issue written by Terry Blas and drawn by Bruno Olivera was published as part of the &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Voices&quot; Infinity Comic series on the Marvel Unlimited app.

==Fictional team biography==
When Alex, Chase, Gert, Karolina, Molly, and Nico witness their parents (&quot;The Pride&quot;) sacrifice a girl in an occult ceremony, the group runs off. As the story progresses, the children learn of their heritage and abilities, and steal resources from their parents, including futuristic gauntlets, a dinosaur, and a mystical Staff. Using these resources, they manage to remove their parents, who were aided by their benefactors, the Gibborim, from their criminal hold of Los Angeles. Alex, concealing his true loyalty to his parents, betrays the other Runaways to the Pride; in the final battle with the Pride, Alex is incinerated by the Gibborim.

With the Pride defeated, Nico becomes the de facto leader, and the other Runaways now vow to prevent other villains from filling in the void left by their parents. When an older version of Gert time travels to the present, she begs the Runaways to find a boy named Victor Mancha and stop him before he grows up to become a villain in her time named &quot;Victorious&quot;. He betrayed her and then murdered every hero on the planet. It is at this point she dies, but the Runaways decide to comply with her wish. The Runaways track down Victor and discover that his actual &quot;father&quot; is Ultron who created Victor as a sleeper agent for the Avengers. The Runaways foiled this plan, but Victor still fears this future may come true. They take Victor in after realizing that he is in the same boat as they are. A shape-shifting alien Skrull Xavin arrives on earth and demands Karolina to leave with them. After a brief confrontation with the Runaways, they explain that Karolina is their fiancée as arranged by their parents and they must go to stop the fifteen-year war between their races. During the wedding ceremony, a fight breaks out between the two races and they barely escape before Majesdane is destroyed. They return to Earth, where they join the team and help rescue Molly along with the rest of the Runaways from the New Pride. Right before the Runaways defeat a new incarnation of the Pride and Alex&#x27;s resurrected father, Gertrude is fatally wounded. Before she passes, she transfers her power to control Old Lace to Chase.

In the &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover event, the Young Avengers travel to Los Angeles to help the Runaways fight off the government agents and Flag-Smasher. The two teams encounter Noh-Varr, who works for S.H.I.E.L.D. and attempts to capture the teenagers. Chase then hatches a plan, without the consent of the rest of the team, to sacrifice himself to the Gibborim, but the team comes to save him, which then causes the Gibborim to be obliterated. When the Runaways are accidentally time-displaced in 1907, they encounter the deceased Runaway Gertrude Yorke&#x27;s parents. After defeating the Yorkes and deadly gang war, plant-manipulator Klara Prast joins the Runaways when they return to the present. Upon returning from 1907, the Runaways find themselves in New York helping the Young Avengers during the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, where the Skrull Armada has invaded seeking Hulkling. Xavin pretended to be loyal to the Skrulls to protect her friends during an attack, but helps them retreat away from the battle.

The Runaways are hunted by several remaining Majesdanian soldiers with the desire to capture Karolina for the problems caused on their planet; in a twisted turn of events, however, Xavin shape-shifts into Karolina and leaves with the Majesdanians. The Runaways also prevent a zombie epidemic in Los Angeles. Molly also visits the X-Men in San Francisco and reconciles with Wolverine. The team is attacked while staying in Chase&#x27;s parent&#x27;s beach house. Old Lace is critically wounded saving Klara, whose powers cause foliage to keep the house from crumbling, but trapping everybody. A man alleging to be Chase&#x27;s uncle appears and tries to help, but is followed by the military. The team runs away, but Chase separates and is critically wounded in a car accident while running across the street chasing a figure reminiscent to Gertrude.

The reunited Runaways later formed an uneasy alliance with Daken in order to take down Marcus Roston, a superpowered criminal with ties to the Pride. Then they appeared again at the &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; asking for help in finding Old Lace, who has been banished into a secret dimension.

The Runaways partially disbanded afterwards, with Victor joining Hank Pym&#x27;s Avengers A.I. team while Nico and Chase were both captured by Arcade and forced to fight for their lives in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;, later joining other teen superheroes who survived Arcade&#x27;s games in &quot;Avengers Undercover&quot;. After Nico&#x27;s brutal death, dismemberment, and subsequent resurrection in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot;, she is traumatized and has a hard time assimilating back with the Runaways. Chase seemed fine by his experiences in MurderWorld and relished his newfound fame. Chase returned to take care of Karolina, Molly, and Klara. By the end of &quot;Avengers Undercover&quot;, however, the Runaways seem to be together once again. Some time after the events of Avengers Undercover, Nico joins the A-Force before returning to Los Angeles. After Victor&#x27;s time with the Avengers A.I., he is recruited to work with Vision and moves in with him and his family in DC in The Vision (2015).

Some time later, Chase used the Yorkes time machine to go back in time and save Gert before she was killed by Geoffrey Wilder. The plan partially works but Gert is still gravely injured. Nico managed to heal her and they went in search of the past members of the team in the hopes of reforming. Karolina had become a college student, living off her parents&#x27; royalties and in a relationship with Lightspeed from Power Pack, and Molly went to live with her grandmother and study middle school. Both turned down the offer to rejoin the team, but Gert accepted, becoming Molly&#x27;s adopted sister living under her grandmother&#x27;s rule. The pieces of Victor Mancha had been sent by the Avengers to Chase, and he managed to reactive him thereby triggering the &quot;Victorious&quot; program but not completely rebuild him. After rescuing Molly and Gert from her mad scientist grandmother&#x27;s house, the team reformed and began to live on a derelict underground Pride Hostel, with Nico and Chase magically becoming Molly&#x27;s legal guardians. Romance blossomed between Nico and Karolina and between Gert and Victor.

Alex Wilder, reappeared to warn Runaways of an impending danger in the form of Seed of the Gibborim, a trio of gods and descendants of the Gibborim that their parents tried to summon with a ritual. They tried to get the team to continue their families&#x27; ritual, leaving one of the trio – Gib – to watch over them. On the day the ritual was supposed to take place, Gib betrayed the Seed. The two remaining gods were sent into the future to stop their threat. Gib joined the team while Alex was cast out as his former teammates did not trust him.

They were recruited to join a resurrected J-Team, given costumes and support to become official heroes. However, Gert later discovered that Doc Justice, the man who helped them, was simply trying to keep a brand going and had plans to sacrifice Karolina in order to boost his ratings, as he had done many times before. The team fought Doc Justice and, having defeated him, was about to walk away but Old Lace killed Doc and offered his soul to Gib.

===Style===
The series does not use concepts of regular superhero behavior, such as aliases, uniforms, and team names. All the characters in Volume 1, except Alex Wilder, adopt codenames, but they stop using their codenames by the end of Volume 1. Unlike many other super hero teams, the Runaways have more females than males. At one point, there was only one male on the team with four females, prompting other groups to refer to him as &quot;the girls&#x27; getaway man&quot;. At another point, the team has two males, four females and one gender shifter (and a female dinosaur).

Early in the series, Molly is the only character who makes a costume, but she creates it from old bed sheets and clothes, not the traditional uniform of superhero costumes; she never wears the costume again. During battle, the Runaways mainly fight in their street clothes and call each other by their given names. Furthermore, the children almost never refer to themselves as &quot;the Runaways&quot; as the series&#x27; title might suggest; their team simply goes unnamed, except for one brief instance, when Nico calls them &quot;the Runaways&quot;, and tells them to &quot;run away&quot;. Other Marvel characters in the Marvel Universe usually refer to the nameless team as &quot;the Pride&#x27;s kids&quot; or &quot;those kids in L.A.&quot; Vaughan even mocks the notion of superhero catchphrases such as &quot;Hulk smash!&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Clobberin&#x27; Time&quot;, or &quot;Avengers assemble!&quot;. During a battle with Swarm, Nico semi-sarcastically tells Victor the team&#x27;s rallying call is &quot;Try not to die&quot;. However, despite Vaughan&#x27;s efforts to break down the superhero clichés within &quot;Runaways&quot;, Marvel&#x27;s handbooks and website still refer to the characters by their codenames. The Marvel miniseries &quot;Mystic Arcana&quot;, published late in 2007, features Nico Minoru under her superhero alias &quot;Sister Grimm&quot;, a name she has not answered to since &quot;Runaways&quot; volume two began; the character one-shot&#x27;s story takes place between 17 and 18 of &quot;Runaways&quot; Volume 1 but she is not referred to by the code-name in it.

===Spin-off===
Excelsior was a support group consisting of former teenage superheroes from defunct Marvel comic series (though one of their members – Lightspeed – was and remains a cast member of a financially and critically successful series of Power Pack books aimed at younger readers). Excelsior was founded by Mickey Musashi (Turbo of the New Warriors) and Phil Urich (the heroic former Green Goblin), and the group&#x27;s stated goals were to help fellow/former teenage superheroes to adjust to normal lives and dissuade other super-powered teenagers from becoming heroes. Though they originally debuted under the name &quot;Excelsior&quot;, the title of the spin-off series was changed from &quot;Excelsior&quot; to &quot;Loners,&quot; due to copyright issues, as Stan Lee held a trademark on the term &quot;Excelsior!&quot;

==Other versions==

===Heroine===
At one point, Gertrude&#x27;s future self travels back in time. She is in her thirties, appearing under the name Heroine, and is without Old Lace. Nico reveals, with the aid of magic, that this version of Gertrude is the leader of the Avengers of her timeline. Superheroes in her time includes characters yet to make an official appearance in the regular Marvel Universe, including an &quot;Iron Woman&quot;, a heroic Scorpion, the &quot;Fantastic Fourteen&quot;, and &quot;Captain Americas&quot;. She, the rest of her team, the X-Men (led by Armor), and the Fantastic Fourteen are killed by Victor Mancha&#x27;s future self, who completed his original mission programmed by Ultron to become the ultimate supervillain &quot;Victorious&quot;.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality warp, the Pride is mentioned as ruling not only Los Angeles, but all of Southern California. Unlike in the normal reality, their children stay with their parents. Karolina is mentioned as being a &quot;go-to&quot; girl for the Wolfpack. When the Scarlet Witch takes the majority of the mutants populations&#x27; powers, Molly is one of the handful that keeps her powers.

In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Brian K. Vaughan revealed that &quot;Runaways&quot; (despite being in the main Marvel Universe) will not refer to the &quot;House of M&quot; reality warp. Vaughan&#x27;s reason for not wanting &quot;Runaways&quot; to refer to the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s attack was because he did not want the readers of &quot;Runaways&quot; to be confused about the complex &quot;House of M&quot; storyline. He did, however say there would be a brief one-line reference, which happened in the following issue: after Molly angrily punches Wolverine out of a church, he lands in the snow and bitterly says, &quot;Only 198 mutants left on the planet... and that girl had to be one of them.&quot; The events of &quot;House of M&quot; and &quot;Decimation&quot; are referred to later in an issue written by Chris Yost with Wolverine encountering Molly again and stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re keeping up with the current events, but there used to be millions of mutants and now there&#x27;s under 200.&quot;

===Marvel Zombies===
In &quot;Marvel Zombies/Army of Darkness&quot; #2, the Blob is chased by various zombie super heroes. Behind him, in the background, zombie versions of the Runaways are shown feeding upon Old Lace.

===Wha... Huh?===
Goofy versions of the original team, including Alex Wilder, are seen in the &quot;Wha... Huh?&quot; one shot as part of a joke about Wolverine appearing in every comic including &quot;Archie&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon&quot;.

===&quot;What If...?&quot;===
In December 2008, all five issues of &quot;What If...?&quot; featured the Runaways becoming the Young Avengers as back-up stories. The five-part backup feature (entitled &quot;What If Runaways became Young Avengers?&quot;) illustrates how Iron Lad recruits the Runaways as the next new wave of the Avengers, forcing them to be an actual superhero team with costumes. However, it is later revealed that the Iron Lad that brought them together was actually Victor Mancha; Iron Lad ran into Victor&#x27;s future self when attempting to flee to the Avengers&#x27; era, with Victorious travelling back with him and using Victor to hijack his equipment. Kang&#x27;s subsequent attempt to rescue his younger self results in Iron Lad being killed. With Kang subsequently erased from history, Victor destroys his future self and departs via Kang&#x27;s time-belt to find his own way, leaving the Runaways to continue as Young Avengers, with Chase now using parts of the Iron Lad armor after he was injured in a fight with Victorious. Written by C.B. Cebulski and drawn by Patrick &quot;Spaz&quot; Spaziante, the story had originally been called &quot;What If the Runaways didn&#x27;t run away?&quot; But it was not until Cebulski accidentally stumbled onto the &quot;Young Avengers&quot; storyline that he decide to merge the two stories. Joe Quesada, editor in chief of Marvel Comics revealed early in his online interview feature, &quot;MyCup o&#x27; Joe&quot;, that the main villain in the What if? storyline is Victorious, though Kang the Conqueror makes an appearance. A reviewer, Jesse Schedeen of IGN cited &quot;What If...?&quot; itself as &quot;a let down&quot;, although the &quot;Runaways&quot; back-up story was positively received.

===&quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot;===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, a version of the Runaways exist, but as an all-mutant covert team under S.H.I.E.L.D. Director General Nick Fury called Ultimate X. After the events of Ultimatum, Nick Fury contacted former X-Men Jean Grey aka Karen Grant with a purpose to unite fellow mutants to combat threats mostly a conflict in Southeast Asian Republic/SEAR with two cities of superhumans. Members include Jimmy Hudson, son of the late Wolverine, Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Allan aka Firestar, a former classmate of Spider-Man who discovered she was a pyrokinetic mutant, and Derek Morgan aka The Guardian, a vigilante in Chicago who can sprout wings, talons and glowing red eyes. The team was officially named The Runaways in &quot;Ultimate Comics: Ultimates&quot;.

===Battle of the Atom===
An alternate future version of an adult Molly Hayes appeared in the X-Men crossover event Battle of the Atom. Initially arriving under the guise of a team of future X-Men, Molly and her companions were later revealed to be members of a new Brotherhood of Mutants led by Raze, the shape-shifting son of Wolverine and Mystique. Molly appears in the comic as a tall, muscular woman with an armored arm and no longer seems to be affected by the fatigue she formerly experienced after using her powers. Following the Brotherhood&#x27;s defeat, Molly hid with her team. In a subsequent encounter it is revealed that Molly was under mind control, she and her companions are freed and return to their future. The other Runaways are mentioned in the event, but do not appear.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
An alternate version of the Runaways star in the comic&#x27;s fourth volume, taking place during &quot;Secret Wars&quot; under the &quot;Battleworld&quot; banner. The mini series was created by ND Stevenson and Sanford Greene. In the series, a different group of children, who are students at the Victor von Doom Institute for Gifted Youths in Doomstadt, discover that the school&#x27;s annual &quot;final exams&quot; are actually fatal. They escape but are chased down by senior student Bucky Barnes, under orders from school headmaster Valeria Von Doom.

Nico Minoru appears part of the A-Force under the &quot;War Zones&quot; banner.

====Members====

*Amadeus Cho of the Warzone, supposedly the brains of the group, as he can rig into computers and Doombots. He slightly admires Delphyne Gorgon.
*Cloak and Dagger of Arachnia, Tyrone is Dagger and Tandy is Cloak. The pair are siblings.
*Delphyne Gorgon of Arcadia, another member of the Night Witches. She loses an arm during the story.

==In other media==
===Television===

In May 2008, a film version of the comic was in the scripting process, with Brian K. Vaughan writing and Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios President of Production, producing. Feige has said, &quot;In our discussions with Brian, we wanted him to be the person to bring it to life. I think it won&#x27;t be a precise story line of any [of his comics], but certainly it will be most similar to the tone or origins of his structure in its initial run&quot;. A 2011 release was considered, as Feige had expected a finished script in early 2009. In April 2010, Peter Sollett emerged as the front runner to direct the movie. In May 2010, British screenwriter Drew Pearce, known for the TV series &quot;No Heroics&quot;, was reported to be writing the film for Marvel Studios. In July 2010, it was reported that filming would begin sometime between March–July 2011. On August 5, 2010, preliminary casting for the film began.

In October 2010, production plans were halted when Marvel chose to focus on &quot;The Avengers&quot;. It was hoped that the film would be scheduled for release sometime in 2014, but the only two releases that year were &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. In March 2013, Kevin Feige said during an interview that they elected not to make the film, but that Drew Pearce had been reassigned to &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; on the strength of his &quot;Runaways&quot; script. On September 24, 2013, Pearce revealed that the film is currently shelved due to the success of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, but also suggested it could see a release at some point in the future.

While talking about &quot;All Hail the King&quot;, Pearce revealed he had been thinking about the possibility of &quot;Runaways&quot; being adapted as a TV series. In August 2016, Hulu ordered a pilot along with additional scripts for a &quot;Runaways&quot; TV series written by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage. Filming will start in February 2017. It was later announced that Schwartz and Savage were jointly hired to be co-showrunners of the series. In February 2017, Head of Marvel Television, Jeph Loeb, announced that the roster of the team had been cast with Rhenzy Feliz, Lyrica Okano, Virginia Gardner, Ariela Barer, Gregg Sulkin, and Allegra Acosta will appear in the series as Alex Wilder, Nico Minoru, Karolina Dean, Gert Yorkes, Chase Stein, and Molly Hernandez respectively.
Later that same month the cast for their parents, the team of supervillains known as The Pride, were announced. In July 2017, Jeph Loeb officially confirmed that it takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

<text>The Antennae Galaxies (also known as NGC 4038/NGC 4039 or Caldwell 60/Caldwell 61) are a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Corvus. They are currently going through a starburst phase, in which the collision of clouds of gas and dust, with entangled magnetic fields, causes rapid star formation. They were discovered by William Herschel in 1785.

==General information==

The Antennae Galaxies are undergoing a galactic collision. These interacting galaxies are located 0.25° north of 31 Crateris and 3.25° southwest of Gamma Corvi. A 2008 study found that they are less remote from the Milky Way than previously thought—at 45 million light-years instead of 65 million light-years.

Located in the NGC 4038 group with five other galaxies, these two galaxies are known as the Antennae Galaxies because the two long tails of stars, gas and dust ejected from the galaxies as a result of the collision resemble an insect&#x27;s antennae. 

The nuclei of the two galaxies are joining to become one giant galaxy. Most galaxies probably undergo at least one significant collision in their lifetimes. This is likely the future of our Milky Way when it collides with the Andromeda Galaxy. This collision and merger sequence (the Toomre sequence) for galaxy evolution was developed in part by successfully modeling the Antennae Galaxies&#x27; &quot;antennae&quot; in particular.

The Antennae galaxies also contain a relatively young collection of massive globular clusters that were possibly formed as a result of the collision between the two galaxies. The young age of these clusters is in contrast to the average age of most known globular clusters (which are around 12 billion years old), with the formation of the globulars likely originating from shockwaves, generated by the collision of the galaxies, compressing large, massive molecular clouds. The densest regions of the collapsing and compressing clouds are believed to be the birthplace of the clusters.

NGC 4038 has a lot of Cepheid Variables, around 53 of them.

==Supernovae==
Four supernovae have been observed in NGC 4038.

* SN 1974E (type unknown, mag. 14) was discovered by Miklós Lovas on 21 March 1974.
* SN 2004gt (type Ic, mag. 14.9) was discovered by Berto Monard on 12 December 2004.
* SN 2007sr (type Ia, mag. 12.9) was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey on 18 December 2007.
* SN 2013dk (type Ic, mag. 15.8) was discovered by the CHASE Project (CHilean Automatic Supernovas sEarch) on 22 June 2013.
One supernova has been found in NGC 4039.
* SN 1921A (type unknown, mag. 16) was discovered by Edwin Hubble and John Charles Duncan in March 1921.

==Timeline==
About 1.2 billion years ago, the Antennae were two separate galaxies. NGC 4038 was a barred spiral galaxy and NGC 4039 was a spiral galaxy. 900 million years ago, the Antennae began to approach one another, looking similar to NGC 2207 and IC 2163. 600 million years ago, the Antennae passed through each other, looking like the Mice Galaxies. 300 million years ago, the Antennae&#x27;s stars began to be released from both galaxies. Today the two streamers of ejected stars extend far beyond the original galaxies, resulting in the antennae shape.

Within 400 million years, the Antennae&#x27;s nuclei will collide and become a single core with stars, gas, and dust around it. Observations and simulations of colliding galaxies (e.g., by Alar Toomre) suggest that the Antennae Galaxies will eventually form an elliptical galaxy.

==X-ray source==
Areas containing large amounts of neon (Ne), magnesium (Mg), and silicon (Si) were found when the Chandra X-ray Observatory analyzed the Antennae Galaxies. Heavy elements such as these are necessary in order for planets that may contain life (as we know it) to form. The clouds imaged contain 16 times as much magnesium and 24 times as much silicon as the Sun.

<text>The Mitchell &amp; Kenyon film company was a pioneer of early commercial motion pictures based in Blackburn in Lancashire, England, at the start of the 20th century. They were originally best known for minor contributions to early fictional narrative film and Boer War dramatisation films, but the discovery in 1994 of a hoard of film negatives led to restoration of the Mitchell &amp; Kenyon Collection, the largest surviving collection of early non-fiction actuality films in the world. This collection provides a fresh view of Edwardian era Britain and is an important resource for historians.

==Background ==
Following on from the first motion picture, made in October 1888 by Louis Le Prince in the United Kingdom, the first showing to a paying audience was by Auguste and Louis Lumière of France, in Paris in 1895 and in London the following year, featuring &quot;La sortie des usines Lumière&quot; showing workers leaving their factory gates in Lyon. Others in France and Britain soon made films, some in &quot;the factory-gate film&quot; genre, and when Mitchell &amp; Kenyon came together they found themselves ideally placed in the heart of the industrial North of England. People were excited at the opportunity of seeing themselves on film, and there were commercial opportunities for short films featuring as many local people as possible.

==&quot;We take them and make them.&quot; ==
Sagar Mitchell and James Kenyon founded the firm of &quot;Mitchell &amp; Kenyon&quot; in 1897. Under the trade name of &quot;Norden&quot;, the company was one of the largest film producers in the United Kingdom in the 1900s, with the slogans of &quot;Local Films For Local People&quot; and &quot;We take them and make them&quot;, they operated initially from their respective business premises at 40 Northgate and 21 King Street, Blackburn.

The first reported showing of a Mitchell &amp; Kenyon film was a film of Blackburn Market, shown at 40 Northgate, in Blackburn, on 27 November 1897. The company produced films either on their own initiative or as commissioned by local businesses. In April 1899 the travelling showman George Green commissioned them to film workers leaving factories, to be shown at the Easter fair, thus beginning the showing of their films by a network of showmen.

Three &quot;Norden&quot; fiction films released in September 1899 – &quot;The Tramp&#x27;s Surprise&quot;, &quot;The Tramps and the Artist&quot;, and &quot;Kidnapping by Indians&quot; – brought them to national attention. The success of their early films encouraged Mitchell to give up his shop and in September 1901 Mitchell &amp; Kenyon moved into premises in Clayton Street, Blackburn, to concentrate on film production. Fiction production was not as extensive as their production of &quot;topicals&quot;, but by 1903 the company had an outdoor studio at its premises at 22 Clayton Street, Blackburn, which was used in addition to outside locations. The Cinema Museum in London currently preserves 65 &quot;Norden&quot; fiction films.

The showmen became self-publicising travelling cinematograph operators. Films taken during the day were shown on the same evening in fairground tents or local meeting halls and music halls with slogans like &quot;see yourselves as others see you&quot;. Dramas took a while to catch on and the non-fiction actuality films were more popular. A typical two-hour programme would show drama, comedy, live actors and then the main attraction, local &quot;topicals&quot;, with a brass band and the showman&#x27;s commentary during the silent films, plus occasional sound effects from guns and members of the audience paid to scream and faint to add to the excitement.

===Topicals===

As well as workers streaming out of factory gates, Mitchell &amp; Kenyon filmed street scenes, parades, marches, walking out on Sunday and the fairgrounds. Charmingly, as the crowds pass by there are usually a few who come up and stare or wave at the camera, in a way that nowadays annoys news presenters. The street scenes are busy with pedestrians wandering across in front of the slow horse-drawn carts and trams, some horse-drawn as well as the new electric trams, and Mitchell &amp; Kenyon added variety by filming from moving trams. Bicycles abound, and they also showed the novel rarity, a motor car. Warships and steamboats are shown, and at the Liverpool docks emigrants are shown boarding ships such as the Cunarder bound for Boston, the films having been developed on the same day for relatives to see that night.

Workers now had one week&#x27;s holiday each year, albeit unpaid, and films were made in the thriving holiday resorts including Blackpool and Morecambe Bay. Leisure activities shown include boating on rivers, promenading in pleasure gardens and rolling Easter eggs.

The parades and processions include carnivals with participants blacking up and doing &#x27;golliwog&#x27; dance routines, and men dressed as both Dutch men and women doing a clog dance. Others show religious processions, carnival processions, charity parades and marches, and Temperance parades featuring their children&#x27;s section, &quot;The Band of Hope&quot;. Military marches and parades were featured, as well as marches by the Boys&#x27; Brigade and the Church Lads&#x27; Brigade.

===News and re-enactments ===
The outbreak of the Boer War in South Africa in October 1899 brought new business opportunities to the company – it turned its attention to the production of war films. Troops were shown marching off to join the war or coming back from the front, past flag waving spectators. Crowds were shown greeting war heroes, in particular Private Charles Ward of Leeds, the last man to receive the Victoria Cross from Queen Victoria herself, being interviewed by Ralph Pringle.

Fictionalised scenes from the South African war and the Boxer Rebellion were filmed in the countryside around Blackburn. These are described as fakes, but the audiences may well have accepted them as dramatic re-enactments. Screenings were enlivened by smoke bombs and guns being fired.

Mitchell &amp; Kenyon&#x27;s most innovative film was &quot;The Arrest of Goudie&quot; in 1901, which is arguably the world&#x27;s first filmed crime reconstruction – the film incorporates the actual crime locations and depicts the arrest of Thomas Goudie, a Bank of Liverpool employee who embezzled £170,000 while involved in a gambling ring. The film was shown at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Liverpool only three days after Goudie&#x27;s arrest. Goudie was subsequently jailed for ten years. A full detailed history of this film by Vanessa Toulmin can be found in &quot;An Early Film Crime Rediscovered: Mitchell &amp; Kenyon’s &quot;Arrest of Goudie&quot; (1901)&quot;, in &quot;Film History&quot; volume 16, no 1 (2004): 37–53.

===Sports===
The recent introduction of Saturday afternoons off work had made sporting events into popular mass entertainment. Mitchell &amp; Kenyon filmed these events, taking care to get as many spectators in as possible as well as showing some of the action. They took the first known film of the newly renamed Manchester United, at the match they played on 6 December 1902 against Burnley – the film was to have been shown that evening at the Burnley Mechanics&#x27; Institute, but the showing was cancelled as Burnley lost 2–0, and the film was never shown until its recent rediscovery. A match between Sheffield United and Bury in September 1902 featured William &quot;Fatty&quot; Foulke, one of the most famous players of his day who also played for Bradford City and Chelsea. They also filmed possibly the first football injury to be captured on film, when an Irish striker struck the goalpost in the Wales versus Ireland international match at Wrexham in 1906. For further details see Vanessa Toulmin, &quot;Edwardian Sport on Film&quot;, &quot;International Journal of Sport in History&quot;, volume 26, no. 2 (2006).

Rugby league and cricket matches were also featured, and when A.D. Thomas, who styled himself &quot;the picture king, the mastermind of the world&quot;, heard of a cricketing scandal where the respected Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold was repeatedly no-balled by the umpire, Jim Phillips, he promptly commissioned a filmed re-enactment of Mold&#x27;s bowling to prove that his technique was valid – the first action replay, which was a popular success.

Other films featured rowing events, horse trotting, athletics, cycle races and motor tricycle races.

===Comedy ===
As early as 1900 some fiction films included slapstick comedy with blundering policemen, in anticipation of the Keystone Cops and Charlie Chaplin more than a decade later. &quot;Diving Lucy&quot; of 1903 showed a lady&#x27;s legs sticking up out of a pond in Blackburn&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Park, and rescuers setting up a plank which a tubby policeman goes out on only to find it a hoax, at which the others let go and he falls in the water. It was an international success, in France and the U.S. where it was billed as &quot;the hit British comedy of the year&quot;.

To enliven some street scenes the showmen arranged for mock fights or hosing down a spectator, and slapstick was added to park scenes with male actors dressed as women falling off a donkey or in the water from a boat, revealing their petticoats under the long skirts of the time.

===Decline===
In May 1907 Sagar Mitchell resumed possession of his original business, S. &amp; J. Mitchell, at 40 Northgate, Blackburn. The volume of film production seems to have tailed off from this date, and from 1909 was increasingly restricted to local events. By the mid-1900s the taste of audiences for seeing themselves was fading, and more structured films were coming into vogue and the company concentrated on their fictional output. The last surviving film dates from 1913. Mitchell was joined in his business by his son John in 1921. His partnership with Kenyon was formally dissolved around 1922 and Kenyon died in 1925. Mitchell carefully stored the film negatives away in the basement of his shop. He lived to the age of 85, and died on 2 October 1952. John continued to run the business until he retired in 1960.

==Discovery and restoration of the Collection==
In 1994, during demolition work in what had been Mercers toy shop in Northgate, Blackburn, two workmen were clearing out the basement when they found three metal drums like milk churns, and looked inside to see hundreds of small spools of film. On their way to the Lethbridges Scrap Metal Processors was Magic Moments Video which did cine to video transfers, and the workmen dragged in a churn and asked the proprietor, Nigel Garth Gregory, if the films were of any value.

Knowing of local businessman and historian Peter Worden&#x27;s interest in cinematography, Gregory phoned Worden and offered to arrange for the drums to be delivered to him. Following delivery Worden examined the rolls and realised that the film stock was highly volatile and stored the rolls in a chest freezer in his garage until their transfer to the British Film Institute in July 2000. A large cache of Mitchell &amp; Kenyon negative and positive films and a Norden cinematographic camera was offered by Christie&#x27;s South Kensington on 23 November 1997. A second group of five 35 mm negatives was sold by the same auction house on 20 February 1997. The film titles sold in the initial lot are listed in the reference.

Worden, along with another local historian, Robin Whalley, researched the films and provided an invaluable introduction to the firm and their films in an article published as &quot;Forgotten Firm&quot; in &quot;Film History&quot;, volume 10, no. 1, 1998 ().

The Peter Worden Collection of Mitchell &amp; Kenyon Films has now been preserved by staff at the British Film Institute&#x27;s National Film and Television Archive, carefully storing the dangerously flammable 35 mm nitrate negatives in rooms that are constructed with water tanks suspended above a glass ceiling so that if the stock should ignite, the resulting fire will cause the glass ceiling to fail and enable the suspended tanks of water to extinguish the fire. Painstaking film preservation techniques were used to produce remarkably clean and scratch-free positives, adjusting the speed to smooth out the variations in these hand-cranked films. The results are fresh and natural, offering an unparalleled social record of early 20th century British life.

The University of Sheffield&#x27;s National Fairground Archive and the British Film Institute were awarded a three-year research grant by the Arts and Humanities Research Board to research, catalogue, identify and contextualise the 800-plus films. This has culminated in a collection of essays, &quot;The Lost World of Mitchell and Kenyon: Edwardian Britain on Film&quot;, edited by Vanessa Toulmin, Simon Popple and Patrick Russell and published by the BFI in October 2004 (, paperback, , hardback) and 15 articles. The major catalogue and interpretation of the Collection has been published by the British Film Institute titled &quot;Electric Edwardians: The Story of the Mitchell &amp; Kenyon Collection&quot; (London: BFI, 2006), by Vanessa Toulmin; it contains 431 stills from the collection, an array of handbills and posters from the National Fairground Archive and 100,000 words of text and filmographic references. Also available is a companion DVD titled &quot;The Electric Edwardians&quot; with two hours of highlights from the Collection, extras on the archiving of the films, an essay by film historian Tom Gunning and an interview with the lead researcher on the Collection, Vanessa Toulmin. Other DVD releases include &quot;Mitchell &amp; Kenyon in Ireland&quot; and &quot;Edwardian Sport on Film&quot;, though only available in Region 2.

A prime-time three-part series &quot;The Lost World of Mitchell &amp; Kenyon&quot; was shown on the BBC in January 2005 with enthusiastic commentary by historian Dan Cruickshank and interviews with descendants of people shown in the films, and is available on DVD from the BBC and the BFI.

In 2014, &quot;The Life and Times of Mitchell and Kenyon&quot; was produced at The Dukes, Lancaster and the Oldham Coliseum, starring Gareth Cassidy, Liam Gerrard and Christopher Wright, with video elements by imitating the dog.

The BFI and the NFA have toured the Collection extensively presenting over 100 shows throughout the North of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, proving once again that local films for local people are as popular today as they were a century ago. Vanessa Toulmin of the National Fairground Archive has also presented specialist feature shows on the history of rugby league with Professor Tony Collins, seaside entertainment with John Walton, and football history with Dave Russell.

In May 2011, the Collection was inscribed in UNESCO&#x27;s UK Memory of the World Register.

<text>Loyd Haberly (December 9, 1896 – March 27, 1981) was an American poet, letterpress printer, and educator. 

==Career==
Haberly was born in Ellsworth, Iowa, on December 9, 1896, and raised in Iowa and Oregon. After studying at Reed College and Harvard, Haberly was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study Law at Trinity College, Oxford. However, he became interested in fine printing while in England and began to print and bind books under his own imprint, the Seven Acres Press. He was named controller of the Gregynog Press, a well-known private press in Wales, in 1933, but his tenure with the press was brief and, by most accounts, less than satisfactory to all concerned.

While with the press he commissioned a typeface, variously known as Paradiso, Gregynog, Gwendoline or Foligno; when he left he was presented with a supply of the type, which he later used, after returning to the United States, in the production of a number of hand-printed limited editions for which he served as author, illustrator, printer, and binder.

In addition to his poetic work and &quot;bookbuilding&quot; activities, Haberly wrote a biography of George Catlin entitled &quot;Pursuit of the Horizon,&quot; and translated portions of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, and also wrote an account of his life as a printer in the United Kingdom. He taught at several universities, most notably Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, where he became Dean. He died on March 27, 1981. His son, David Haberly, is a noted scholar in the field of Latin American studies.

<text>Honoratus (; c. 350 – 6 January 429) was the founder of Lérins Abbey who later became an early Archbishop of Arles. He is honored as a saint in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.

==Life==
Honoratus was born in the north of Gaul to a consular Roman family. He received an outstanding education. He converted to Christianity with his brother Venantius and embarked with him from Marseilles about 368, under the guidance of a holy person named Caprasius, to visit the holy places of Palestine and the lauræ of Syria and Egypt. The sudden death of Venantius at Methone, Achaia prevented the pious travellers from going further. They returned to Gaul through Italy, and, after having stopped at Rome, Honoratus went on into Provence. Encouraged by Leontius of Fréjus, he took up his abode on the wild Lérins Island today called the Île Saint-Honorat, with the intention of living there in solitude.

===Lerins===
Numerous disciples soon gathered around Honoratus, including Lupus of Troyes, Eucherius of Lyon, and Hilary of Arles. Thus was founded the Monastery of Lérins, which has enjoyed so great a celebrity status and which was, during the 5th and 6th centuries, a nursery for illustrious bishops and remarkable ecclesiastical writers. His Rule of Life was chiefly borrowed from that of St. Pachomius. It is believed St. Patrick trained there for his missionary work in Ireland. 

===Archbishop of Arles===
Honoratus&#x27; reputation for sanctity throughout the southeastern portion of Gaul was such that in 426 after the assassination of Patroclus, Archbishop of Arles, he was summoned from his solitude to succeed to the government of the diocese, which the Arian and Manichaean beliefs had greatly disturbed. He appears to have succeeded in re-establishing order and orthodoxy, while still continuing to direct from afar the monks of Lérins. 

He died in the arms of Hilary, one of his disciples and probably a relative, who was to succeed him in the See of Arles. Hilary wrote the &quot;Sermo de Vita Sancti Honorati&quot; probably around 430.

Honoratus&#x27; various writings have not been preserved, nor has the Rule which he gave to the solitaries of Lérins. John Cassian, who had visited his monastery, dedicated to him several of his &quot;Conferences&quot;.
==&quot;La Vida de Sant Honorat&quot;==
In the Middle Ages, Honaratus was the object of a pilgrimage in the Arles region, especially around Lérins Abbey, because of the writings in Occitan of Raymond Féraud (or Raimon Feraud), a monk who composed a hagiographical life for him around 1300 in Roquesteron.

==Legacy==
One of the Lérins islands near the Antibes off the French Riviera is now called St. Honorat in his honor.
