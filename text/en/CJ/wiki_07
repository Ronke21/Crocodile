<text>HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; was one of five pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy at the end of the 19th century. The &quot;London&quot;s were a sub-class of the pre-dreadnoughts. Completed in 1902 she was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet as its flagship. The ship then served with the Channel and Home Fleets from 1907 to 1910, usually as a flagship. From 1910 to 1914, she was in reserve in the Home Fleet.

Following the start of the First World War in August 1914, &quot;Bulwark&quot;, along with the rest of the squadron, was attached to the reformed Channel Fleet to protect the British Expeditionary Force as it moved across the English Channel to France. On 26 November 1914 she was destroyed by a large internal explosion with the loss of 741 men near Sheerness; only a dozen men survived the detonation. It was probably caused by the overheating of cordite charges that had been placed adjacent to a boiler-room bulkhead. Little of the ship survived to be salvaged and her remains were designated a controlled site under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. Diving on the wreck is generally forbidden.

==Design and description==

The five ships of the &quot;London&quot; class were ordered in 1898 in response to increased naval construction for the Imperial Russian Navy. The design for the &quot;London&quot; class was prepared in 1898; it was a virtual repeat of the preceding , though with significant revision to the forward armour protection scheme. Rather than a traditional transverse bulkhead for the forward end of the main belt armour, the belt was carried further forward and gradually tapered in thickness. Deck armour was also strengthened.

&quot;Bulwark&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. The ship had a metacentric height of . Her crew numbered 738 officers and ratings as a private ship and up to 789 when serving as a flagship. The &quot;London&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of three-cylinder inverted vertical triple-expansion steam engines. The cylinders were , and diameter with a stroke of . Each set drove one screw, using steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The &quot;London&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from . During her sea trials, &quot;Bulwark&quot; reached from . The ships carried enough coal to give them a range of at a speed of .

The main battery of the &quot;London&quot; class consisted of four BL 12-inch (305 mm) Mk IX guns mounted in twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament consisted of a dozen BL Mk VII guns mounted in casemates mounted in the sides of the hull. Defence against torpedo boats was provided by sixteen quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder () 12 cwt guns, eight of which were mounted in the central superstructure and the remaining eight guns were positioned on the main deck fore and aft and fired through unarmoured embrasures in the hull. Each of the two fighting tops were provided with three QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. As was customary for battleships of the period, they were also equipped with four submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in the hull, two on each broadside.

The &quot;London&quot;s had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt were thick. Their main-gun turret faces were protected by armour plates thick, atop 12-inch barbettes, and the casemate guns were protected with 6 inches of Krupp steel. The conning tower had thick sides. The ships were fitted with three armoured decks, ranging in thickness between each.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Bulwark&quot;, named for &quot;the solid part of a ship&#x27;s side extending above deck&quot;, was the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was one of the three battleships ordered as part of the 1898–1899 Naval Estimates. She was laid down at HM Dockyard, Devonport, on 20 March 1899 and launched on 18 October 1899 by Lady Harriet Fairfax, wife of Admiral Sir Henry Fairfax, Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. The ship was completed in March 1902, at a cost of £997,846 plus £167,970 for her armament. &quot;Bulwark&quot; was commissioned by Captain Frederick Hamilton on 18 March for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. Admiral Sir Compton Domvile hoisted his flag on board on 1 May as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet.

===1902–1909===
She left Plymouth five days later, and arrived at Gibraltar on the 10th, then proceeded to Malta. In August, she was the flagship of a squadron visiting the Aegean Sea for combined manoeuvres and visits to Lemnos and Nauplia, and was slightly damaged during an exercise where the battleship misjudged the distance while attempting to tow &quot;Bulwark&quot; and collided with her. The following month, the annual manoeuvres with the Channel Fleet began off the coasts of Greece and Italy. She visited Cagliari, Sardinia, in October during the exercise. In late December 1902 she was back in Greek waters when she visited Astakos in the Ionian Sea with HMS &quot;Irresistible&quot; and HMS &quot;Pioneer&quot;. On 18 April 1903, King Edward VII was hosted aboard &quot;Bulwark&quot; and he reviewed the fleet two days later. During the fleet manoeuvres in August off the coast of Portugal, the ship was visited by King Carlos I of Portugal. During Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s visit to Malta in April 1904, he assumed temporary command of &quot;Bulwark&quot; on 11 April as an honorary British Admiral of the Fleet. Domville and &quot;Bulwark&quot; sometimes served as observers during the manoeuvres with the Channel Fleet in May 1905, rather than participating in them. The Mediterranean Fleet was recalled to Malta from the Adriatic Sea on 27 October after the Dogger Bank Incident where the Russian Baltic Fleet mistakenly fired upon British fishermen as it passed through the North Sea en route to the Far East during the Russo-Japanese War. The fleet arrived on the 29th and began loading coal and ammunition in preparation for war, but stood down on 2 November after the Russians agreed to investigate the incident. On 10 December, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was ordered back to England for her crew to be paid off and Domville hauled his flag down three days later. The ship departed Malta on 14 December, arrived at Devonport on 21 December and was paid off two days later.

&quot;Bulwark&quot; was recommissioned on 3 January 1905 with Commander Edward Philpotts as the acting flag captain and departed on 5 January for Malta where she arrived on the 12th where Domville rehoisted his flag. On 9 June, the ship arrived at Genoa, Italy, where Domville hauled his flag down again and Captain Osmond Brock relieved Philpotts. Two days later, she arrived in Malta where Admiral Lord Charles Beresford hoisted his flag aboard as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Bulwark&quot; began a lengthy refit at Malta on 30 October that lasted until 5 February 1906; the work included the addition of spotting tops equipped with Barr &amp; Stroud coincidence rangefinders. On 10 February, the ship departed for Lagos, Portugal, to rendezvous with the Channel and Atlantic Fleets for manoeuvres that lasted the rest of the month. The annual manoeuvres that began on 24 June were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a strategy of commerce raiding as &quot;Bulwark&quot; was the flagship of the fleet blockading Lagos before the general fleet action began three days later. In 1906–1907, all the main-deck 12-pounders were repositioned on the superstructure.

On 19 January 1907, she departed Malta for Portsmouth to be paid off; after arriving on 26 January, Beresford hauled down his flag, although the ship was not paid off until 11 February at Devonport. On 12 February, &quot;Bulwark&quot; was recommissioned under the command of Captain Bertram Chambers to serve as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Frank Finnis of the Nore Division, Home Fleet. The ship visited Trondheim, Norway, on 18 June and then Invergordon, Scotland, on the 26th. She was present during the fleet review conducted by King Edward at Cowes on 3 August. After participating in the fleet manoeuvres earlier in October, &quot;Bulwark&quot; ran aground twice near Lemon Light in the North Sea while trying to avoid Dutch fishing ships on 26 October, but was able to get herself free both times. Her bottom was slightly damaged during the incidents and she entered drydock at HM Dockyard, Chatham on 31 October to begin repairs and a lengthy refit that lasted until 9 March 1908. While still in dockyard hands, Captain Arthur Leveson temporarily assumed command on 3 January and Rear-Admiral Stanley Colville relieved Finnis in command of the Nore Division on 17 January. After conducting torpedo and gunnery training and trials over the preceding months, Captain Robert Falcon Scott of Antarctic fame was appointed captain of &quot;Bulwark&quot; on 18 May. On 1 August, the ship put into Sheerness Dockyard to pay off the crew, some of whom joined the battleships and when she was formally decommissioned on 17 August. &quot;Bulwark&quot; was recommissioned the following day with a nucleus crew from the battleship . She was transferred to the Channel Fleet on 3 October and arrived at Plymouth Sound on 11 December. Ten days later, Devonport Dockyard began repairs to the ship&#x27;s 12-inch turrets and replacement of the worn-out gun barrels that took until 3 March 1909 to complete. That same day, Captain Bentinck Yelverton assumed command of the battleship. Under the fleet reorganisation of 24 March 1909, the Channel Fleet became the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet. &quot;Bulwark&quot; was present at the fleet review at Spithead conducted for the Lords of the Admiralty on 12 June.

===1909–1914===

She was refitted at Devonport from 25 August to 17 December and was paid off on 28 February 1910. The following day &quot;Bulwark&quot; recommissioned into the reserve at Devonport with a nucleus crew as the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Neville, Vice-Admiral of the 3rd and 4th Divisions, Home Fleet, at the Nore, with Captain Cunningham Foot in temporary command. He was relieved by Captain George Hope on 18 March. &quot;Bulwark&quot; participated in the annual manoeuvres in July and she began a brief refit on 30 December that was completed on 25 February 1911. Captain Edmund Hyde Smith relieved Hope on 24 March and Vice-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg assumed command of the 3rd and 4th Divisions. &quot;Bulwark&quot; was paid off on 25 April, and Prince Louis hauled his flag down that same day. She was recommissioned as a private ship the next day with a nucleus crew. The ship was present during the Coronation Fleet Review of King George V at Spithead on 24 June. &quot;Bulwark&quot; arrived at Chatham on 23 July to unload her ammunition and stores in preparation for an extensive refit that began on 1 September and lasted until 1 May 1912.

By this time, a pair of the 3-pounders had been repositioned on the bridge and the others had been removed. While conducting sea trials, the ship grounded twice on Barrow Deep off the Nore during refit trials on 4 May 1912, extensively damaging her bottom. Repairs were not completed until the end of the month. On 4 June Captain Herbert Chatterton recommissioned &quot;Bulwark&quot; which was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron (BS) of the Second Fleet. She briefly served as the flagship for the second-in-command of the squadron from 20 August until September, when his own ship returned. Aside from occasional gunnery practice, the ship was very inactive for the rest of the year; for example, she did not leave Spithead from 18 November 1912 to 25 February 1913. &quot;Bulwark&quot; was refitted at Portsmouth from 14 April – 4 June. The ship participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres in August and returned to Spithead on 30 October where she remained for the rest of the year. Captain Guy Sclater relieved Hyde Smith on 17 November.

&quot;Bulwark&quot; was visited by King Christian X of Denmark when he inspected the squadron on 9 May 1914. On 22 May, she began her annual refit at Chatham which was completed on 9 July. The following day she was alerted to prepare for a test mobilisation in lieu of the annual fleet manoeuvres as part of the British response to the July Crisis. The mobilisation was ordered on 15 July, and the fleet was reviewed two days later at Spithead after which it conducted exercises.

===First World War===
At the beginning of the First World War, &quot;Bulwark&quot; and the 5th BS were based at Portland and assigned to the newly reformed Channel Fleet to defend the English Channel. After covering the safe transportation of the British Expeditionary Force to France in August, the 5th BS remained in Portsmouth until 4 September when they returned to Portland. They stayed there through October aside from exercises. From 5 to 9 November, &quot;Bulwark&quot; hosted the court martial of Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge for his actions during the pursuit of the German battlecruiser and light cruiser in the Mediterranean Sea in August. On 14 November, the 5th BS was transferred to Sheerness because of concern that a German invasion of Great Britain was in the offing.

====Explosion====

A powerful internal explosion ripped &quot;Bulwark&quot; apart at about 07:53 on 26 November 1914 while she was moored at Number 17 buoy in Kethole Reach, west of Sheerness in the estuary of the River Medway. All the ship&#x27;s officers were killed in the explosion and only a dozen ratings survived. A total of 741 men were lost, including members of the band of the gunnery school, HMS &quot;Excellent&quot;, which was playing aboard. Only about 30 bodies were recovered after the explosion. In terms of loss of life, the incident remains the second most catastrophic accidental explosion in the history of the United Kingdom, exceeded only by the explosion of the dreadnought battleship , caused by a stokehold fire detonating a magazine, at Scapa Flow in 1917.

A naval court of enquiry into the causes of the explosion that was held on 28 November ruled out external explosions such as a torpedo or a mine because eyewitnesses spoke of a flash of flame near the aft turret and then one or two explosions quickly following, not the towering column of water associated with explosions against the outer hull. The gunnery logbook, recovered partially intact, and the testimony of the chief gunner&#x27;s clerk, as well as several other survivors, said the six-inch ammunition magazines were being restowed to keep the cordite propellant charges together in lots that morning. This meant at least 30 exposed charges had been left in the cross-passages between the ship&#x27;s magazines with the magazine doors left open when the ship&#x27;s company was called to breakfast at 07:45. These passages were also used to stow hundreds of six-inch and twelve-pounder shells, and the court concluded that the cordite charges had been stowed against one of the boiler-room bulkheads which was increasing in temperature as the boilers were fired up. This ignited the cordite charges which detonated the nearby shells and spread to the aft twelve-inch magazine, which exploded.

==Wreck site==
On 29 November divers sent to find the wreck reported that the ship&#x27;s port bow as far aft as the sick bay had been blown off by the explosion and lay east of the mooring. The starboard bow lay further away. The remainder of the ship had been torn apart so violently that no other large portions of the wreck could be found. One 12-inch gun was located on 28 December, a considerable distance away from her mooring, and later recovered.

The wreck is marked by the &quot;East Bulwark&quot; and &quot;West Bulwark&quot; buoys. It was designated as a controlled site in 2008 due to it being military remains and cannot be dived upon except with permission from the Ministry of Defence.

==Memorials==

A memorial to those lost on &quot;Bulwark&quot; and the minelayer (also lost in an accidental explosion) was erected at the Dockyard Church, Sheerness, in 1921. It was dedicated by Archdeacon Charles Ingles, the Chaplain of the Fleet, and unveiled by Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas, Commander-in-Chief, The Nore. Victims of both ships are also commemorated on the Naval War Memorial at Southsea. Another memorial was placed in Woodlands Road Cemetery, Gillingham, Kent, as part of the Naval Burial Ground.

<text>Heswall () is a coastal town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in Merseyside, England. It was historically part of Cheshire and is located on the Wirral Peninsula. In the 2011 Census, the population was 13,401; this figure included the nearby village of Gayton.

==History==
===Early history===
Before the Norman Conquest, Heswall has been cited as a possible location for Dingesmere, mentioned with regard to the Battle of Brunanburh, in &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot;. Heswall was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Eswelle&quot;, owned by Robert de Rodelent, who also owned much of the land on the eastern side of the River Dee. In 1277, it became the property of Patrick de Haselwall, who was Sheriff of Cheshire.

===Development===
In 1801, the population was recorded as 168. By the census in 1841, it had grown to 398. Before 1897 it was known as &quot;Hestlewelle&quot; or &quot;Hesselwelle&quot;. Its growth was started by wealthy merchants from Liverpool; they had originally chosen it as a retreat, but the arrival of two railway connections allowed them to commute. One line is the Borderlands Line from Wrexham Central to Bidston which opened in 1896. This line is still active and has Heswall railway station on the eastern edge of the town. The station was formerly called Heswall Hills to distinguish it from the older, now demolished, Heswall station. The old station was in Station Road in the Lower Village on another line from West Kirby to Hooton. This opened in 1886 but the line closed to passengers in 1956. The track of the old railway became a footpath, the Wirral Way.

The speedy development of Heswall has seen the once separate villages of Gayton, Heswall, Pensby and Thingwall become joined by continuous housing.

===Architecture===
The oldest structure is the tower of St Peter&#x27;s Parish Church, which is about 500 years old. The present church was built in 1879, and is the third to have been built on the site. The previous church was destroyed by a violent thunderstorm on 19 September 1875; the organist and the boy who pumped the bellows for the organ were both killed.

The remains of Gayton&#x27;s windmill, which stopped operating in 1860 and is now converted into a house, can be seen close to the Devon Doorway pub-restaurant on Gayton Roundabout, a short distance back up Telegraph Road towards Heswall.

The Royal Liverpool Children&#x27;s Hospital originally opened in Heswall as &quot;Liverpool Country Hospital for Children&quot; in 1909. The hospital was situated on a site purchased in 1900. It stood on the opposite side of Telegraph Road from &quot;The Puddydale&#x27;’ and had a clock tower and grounds with views over the Dee estuary. The hospital closed in 1985 and there is now a Tesco supermarket on the site. The supermarket was extended in the early 2000s, then refurbished during 2011.

==Geography==
Located on the eastern side of the Dee Estuary, with views across the river to North Wales, Heswall is 13 miles from Chester and 10 miles from Liverpool (via the Queensway (Birkenhead) Tunnel or 56 miles (avoiding the tunnels). The towers of Liverpool&#x27;s cathedrals can be seen on the horizon from the town.

==Economy==
An affluent area, Heswall was listed as the seventh richest neighbourhood in the UK in 2001, with an average household income of £46,600.

In 2022, the median house price in Heswall was £409,500, making it the most expensive in the Wirral area.

==Open spaces==

There are several areas of open space. The largest is the Dales, an area of dry, sandy heathland overlooking the River Dee. It has the status of both Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Local Nature Reserve (LNR). Within this SSSI lies &#x27;the Dungeon&#x27;, a small river valley cut into the hillside. A path connects the Dales to the Wirral Way and the coast. Other open areas also overlooking the Dee are the Beacons, and Poll Hill, which is the highest point on the Wirral Peninsula. Whitfield Common, off Whitfield Lane, contains open land as well as playing fields and tennis courts.

==Education==
Heswall is well served by St Peter&#x27;s C of E, Gayton and Heswall Primary Schools.

Pensby High School is the local secondary school situated in nearby Pensby.

===Heswall Primary School===
Heswall Primary School serves the local community of Heswall and surrounding areas on the Wirral Peninsula. It opened in 1909. It was originally on the eastern edge of The Puddydale, opposite the Royal Liverpool Children&#x27;s hospital on Telegraph Road (now converted into a local Tesco). The original building was demolished in 1982 after falling into disrepair. Prior to demolition, the juniors were moved to the current Whitfield Lane site in 1976 and the school became known as Whitfield Primary School. The infants joined the juniors in 1982, unifying the school on one site again – eventually becoming Heswall County Primary school.

The current Whitfield Lane site was formerly the location of the Beehive Dairy. The school has retained the Beehive logo in its school badge. The single form entry school has around 220 children on roll. Now known as Heswall Primary School, the school is surrounded by the Barnston fields and has its own field and wooded areas.

The school is the home of Wirral Science Under the Stars, an event run by the school that brings together science links in real life settings with education.

==Transport==

Heswall bus station is owned and managed by Merseytravel; it consists of four stands. The main bus operators are Arriva North West, Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire, Al&#x27;s Coaches, A2B Travel and Aintree Coachlines. Routes link the town with Liverpool, Birkenhead, Chester and West Kirby.

Heswall railway station is a stop on the Borderlands Line, which connects with . Services are operated by Transport for Wales.

The town was also served by a second railway station between 1886 and 1956; the Wirral Way, a shared-use path linking and , now passes through the town.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. Heswall&#x27;s close proximity to North Wales means that BBC Wales and ITV Cymru Wales can also be received from the Moel-y-Parc TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Merseyside, Capital North West &amp; Wales, Heart North West, Smooth Radio North West, Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool &amp; The North West, Hits Radio Liverpool and Wirral Wave Radio, a community-based station.

<doc id="1080860" wikidata="Q1616766" url="?curid=1080860" title="Meols">
<text>Meols (sometimes known as Great Meols) is a suburb in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. On the north coast of the Wirral Peninsula, it forms a contiguous built up area with the nearby town of Hoylake which lies to the west. Historically in Cheshire, since 1 April 1974 it has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral.

The 2001 census recorded the population of Meols as 5,110. 
In the 2011 census specific population figures for Meols were not available. The total population of the Hoylake and Meols local government ward was 13,348.

==History==
Meols was named as such by the Vikings; its original name from the Old Norse for &#x27;sand dunes&#x27; was &quot;&quot;,
becoming &quot;melas&quot; by the time of the Domesday Survey.

Impressive archaeological finds dating back to the Neolithic period suggest that the site was an important centre in antiquity. Since about 1810, a large number of artefacts have been found relating to pre-Roman Carthage, the Iron Age, the Roman Empire, Armenia, the Anglo-Saxons and the Vikings. These include items as varied as coins which belonged to the Coriosolites in Brittany. Also, tokens, brooches, pins, knives, glass beads, keys, pottery, flint tools, mounts, pilgrim badges, pieces of leather, worked wood and iron tools. They came to be discovered after the beginning of large-scale dredging (to accommodate the needs of the nearby growing seaport of Liverpool) started to cause notable sand erosion along the coastline near Meols. These finds suggest that the site was used as a port as far back as the Iron Age some 2,400 years ago, and was once the most important seaport in the present-day North West England. Thus trading connections are believed to have reached far across Europe.
Some of these artefacts are on display locally, at the Museum of Liverpool.
In the 1890s the local authorities built the first sea wall. The rapidly eroding coastline was saved, but the sea wall changed the currents and archaeological sites at Meols were buried in the sand. 
The remains of a submerged forest off Dove Point have now also disappeared but they were visible until the spring of 1982.

In 1938, what was believed to be a Viking (Nordic clinker) boat was discovered beneath of clay when the &#x27;Railway Inn&#x27; public house was being rebuilt. Workers at the time covered the ship over again so as not to delay the construction of the pub&#x27;s new car park.
The pub landlord mentioned its previous discovery to local police constable Tim Baldock, who contacted Professor Stephen Harding of the University of Nottingham. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) equipment was used to confirm existence of the boat and precise location on 10 September 2007.
Further archaeological work was undertaken in February 2023, by a team from Wirral Archaeology CIC, supervised by a professional archaeologist and Professor Harding. Cores of soil were drilled and samples taken away for analysis. By using Carbon14 dating, dendrochronology and wood assessment, the group aim to discover the age of the boat and where the wood it was constructed from was felled.

Meols was formerly called Great Meols. It was a township in West Kirby parish of the Wirral Hundred before becoming a civil parish from 1866. On 31 December 1894 it was abolished to create the Hoylake and West Kirby civil parish. Great Meols had a population of 140 in 1801, 170 in 1851 and 821 in 1901. 
Between 1894 and 1974 it was within Hoylake Urban District. 
On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of the Wirral Peninsula, including Meols, transfer from the county of Cheshire to the newly created county of Merseyside.

The historic name of Great Meols survives in the name of the primary school and the Anglican church. It was still in more general use up to the 1960s, for instance in postal addresses and on the destination indicators of buses from Chester. There also used to be a village called Little Meols, on Meols Drive between Hoylake and West Kirby
The name Little Meols fell out of use in Victorian times, having been absorbed by Hoylake. From 123 inhabitants in 1801 and 170 in 1851, by 1901 at 2,850, its population had outstripped Great Meols.

Meols was known to be spelt as &quot;Meolse&quot; up until when the railway station was placed. The error came about at the time of the station&#x27;s construction, when rail managers took the spelling of Meols from the Southport suburb of Meols Cop and used it for new signage.

==Geography==
Meols is at the north-western corner of the Wirral Peninsula, adjacent to the Irish Sea.

==Governance==
Meols is within the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. The current Member of Parliament is Margaret Greenwood, a Labour representative.

At local government level, the area is incorporated into the Hoylake and Meols Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. It is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. 
The most recent local elections took place on 6 May 2021.

==Community==

Meols is mainly residential with a small yacht and fishing community on its Irish Sea shore line. The centre has a small row of shops adjacent to Meols railway station, the &#x27;Railway Inn&#x27; public house and a primary school. The North Wirral Coastal Park stretches from Dove Point in Meols to New Brighton. There is also a local community park known as Meols Park and Recreation Ground and a bowling green. The Friends of Meols Park are a community group set up in 2007 to help maintain and improve the recreation ground.

==Transport==
The area is served by Meols railway station on the West Kirby branch of Merseyrail&#x27;s Wirral line.

===Bus===
A number of school services also serve Meols.

==Notable people and cultural references==
Cyclist Chris Boardman, winner of a gold medal for Great Britain at the 1992 Summer Olympics, lived in Meols before moving to nearby Hoylake.

Miles Kane, former member of the Little Flames, the Rascals, one half of the Last Shadow Puppets with the Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner and now a successful solo artist, is from Meols.

Andy McCluskey, the co-founder, singer and bass guitarist of the electronic music band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) is also from Meols. OMD had a track called &quot;Red Frame/White Light&quot; from their self-titled debut album which referred to the public telephone box between the church and the Railway Inn on Greenwood Road, Meols. Hidden within the lyrics was the telephone number of the telephone box (632-3003). It is claimed that fans would call that telephone number from all over the world. The telephone box was removed by BT in August 2017 but was returned by October after a campaign by fans of the duo, and now displays a plaque noting its significance.

The television sitcom &quot;Watching&quot;, produced by Granada Television between 1987 and 1993, utilised Meols as a filming location. This was likely because the characters Malcolm and Mrs Stoneway lived in the village.

<doc id="1080863" wikidata="Q7115771" url="?curid=1080863" title="Oxton, Merseyside">
<text>Oxton is a suburb of Birkenhead, Merseyside, England. Administratively it is a ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. Originally a village in its own right, it became part of the Municipal Borough of Birkenhead upon its creation in 1877. Before local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974, it was part of the County Borough of Birkenhead, within the county of Cheshire.

==History==
The name &quot;Oxa-tún&quot; derives from Old Norse, meaning &quot;a farm or enclosure where oxen are kept&quot;. By 1278, the name had been adapted into Old English as &quot;Oxeton&quot; and was recorded as &quot;Oxon&quot; in 1549.

Oxton was once one of the most affluent areas in England mainly due to its proximity to Liverpool and the fact that along with various other Wirral locations, it was a favourite residential area for wealthy Liverpool merchants and tradesmen of the time. Oxton Village is a mainly early Victorian era settlement with fine sandstone and brick built houses, many of which now form part of a conservation area designated in April 1979 and administered by the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. 
Some of these buildings have been designated by English Heritage as Grade II listed.

A significant part of the land on which Oxton is situated was part of the Estate of the Earl of Shrewsbury. This has been commemorated over the years in many of the road names, which bear the family names and titles of the various Earls: Alton Road, Beresford Road, Chetwynd Road, Ingestre Road, Shrewsbury Road, Talbot Road, Waterford Road and Wexford Road. The oldest pub in Oxton Village is called the Shrewsbury Arms and the bar which is now known as the Oxton Bar and Kitchen was formerly the Talbot Hotel.

Christ Church opened in 1849 and has a Father Willis organ, installed in 1888.

==Geography==
===Location===
The Wirral peninsula is formed of Triassic Keuper and Bunter sandstones covered by glacially deposited boulder clay. The historic settlement of Oxon-hill laid to the north-eastern side of the peninsula on the sandstone ridge near to current location of St Saviours Church and the Caernarfon Castle public house

Oxton Village pre-dates the conurbation that developed around Birkenhead, of which it now forms part. It is bordered to the north by Claughton and to the south by Prenton. Birkenhead town centre lies to the east.

Originally an agricultural community, Oxton became a desirable residential location for the middle classes and bourgeoisie as the economy of 19th century Birkenhead and Liverpool grew. The north east of the conservation area, at the junction of Victoria Mount, Rose Mount, Village Road and Claughton Firs developed as a commercial centre with restaurants, pubs, cafes and shops.

===Conservation Area and Oxton Village===
Oxton Village Conservation Area was established in 1979 by Wirral Borough Council in order to &quot;preserve and enhance the village&#x27;s distinctive character&quot;. Soon afterwards, a registered charity was founded to promote the Conservation Area; this was named The Oxton Society. This objective of this charity is to work in partnership with the council, local businesses and the community to pursue this objective.

The approximate boundary is bounded by Shrewsbury Road to the north, Fairview Road to the east, Arno Road to the south and Talbot Road to the west. Irregular in places, the boundary has a number of ‘pockets&#x27; encompassing small groups of properties or parts of streets. In 2010 Wirral Council commissioned an appraisal for Oxton Village Conservation Areas that evaluated and analysed various features which gives the conservation area its special architectural and historic interest. The appraisal made recommendations to extend the Conservation Area boundaries of Normanston Road &amp; Derwent Road, Birch Road, Village Road &amp; Wellington Road and Talbot Road, Mill Hill and Ingestre Road. The consultation period for the boundary extensions has now closed and the extensions are in the process of being adopted.

===Post town controversy===
Owing to a redefining of post towns by the Royal Mail in 2003, Oxton is partially identified as being within Prenton. However, whilst this was only a postal address, in its 22 May 2003 edition, the Liverpool Echo reported that &quot;Jeremy Watson, of the Oxton Society, has called on the Royal Mail to have a ballot&quot;; however, the code at that time did not allow a request to ballot. A similar complaint was made on behalf of Prenton residents when the Royal Mail defined part of Prenton to be within Oxton.

==Education==
Independent and selective Birkenhead School was exclusively a boys&#x27; school from its founding in 1860 until 2000, when its Sixth Form became co-educational. It became fully co-educational in 2008. Birkenhead High School was formerly an independent selective school for girls but became a state-funded all-ability Academy school in 2009. 
Both changes were driven by falling numbers of pupils in the schools as a result of the abolition of the Assisted Places Scheme. Despite this, both schools maintain their place around the top of the Wirral A Level results.

In addition Prenton Preparatory School lies in the heart of the Conservation Area and Oxton St Saviour&#x27;s is the local primary school. A number of other schools lie just outside the boundary of Oxton, including St. Anselm&#x27;s College (boys, RC) and Townfield Primary School.

==Sport==
Oxton Cricket &amp; Sports Club is also located here. Founded in 1875 as Oxton Cricket Club, other sports played at the club include tennis, lacrosse, squash and bowls.

==Demographics==
At the 2001 Census, the population of Oxton was 14,066, consisting of 6,680 males and 7,386 females.

Some 2005 demographic statistics of area CH43, which encompasses the geographical area of Oxton, Claughton and parts of Bidston and Noctorum, (total CH43 population (2005): 36,443) are:

===Administrative history===
Oxton was historically a township and chapelry in the ancient parish of Woodchurch in the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. Part of the township was administratively absorbed into Birkenhead in 1843 when it was added to the improvement commissioners&#x27; district which covered the town.

The rest of the township was made a local government district in 1863, governed by a local board. In 1866 Oxton became a separate civil parish. The local government district was abolished in 1877 and its area was incorporated into the new municipal borough of Birkenhead. Oxton continued to be a civil parish within the borough until 31 March 1898 when all the parishes within the borough were merged into a single parish named &quot;Birkenhead St Mary&quot; or &quot;Birkenhead&quot;. In 1891 the parish had a population of 4429. The borough of Birkenhead was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the metropolitan borough of Wirral in the new county of Merseyside.

<doc id="1080867" wikidata="Q7138469" url="?curid=1080867" title="Parkgate, Cheshire">
<text>Parkgate is a village in the civil parish of Neston, on the Wirral Peninsula in Cheshire, England. It lies on the banks of the River Dee, adjoining of salt marsh. Parkgate forms part of the Neston built up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics. One of the electoral wards of Cheshire West and Chester is named after Parkgate; the ward had a population of 4,972 at the 2021 census.

==History==
Parkgate was an important port from the start of the 18th century, in particular as an embarkation point for Ireland. The River Dee, which was a shipping route to the Roman city of &quot;Deva&quot; (Chester), had partly silted up by AD 383, creating a need for a port further downstream. Quays were built, first at Burton and later near the small town of Neston, but further silting required yet another re-siting slightly further downstream near the gate of Neston&#x27;s hunting park. Hence the settlement of Parkgate was born.
Two distinguished guests stayed at local hostelries. One was Lord Nelson&#x27;s mistress, (Lady) Emma Hamilton, who was born in nearby Ness and bathed at Parkgate, apparently as a cure for a skin complaint. Another was George Frideric Handel. Contrary to often-repeated legend, he did not stay in Parkgate before sailing to Dublin in November 1741 for the first performance of his &quot;Messiah&quot; (he travelled from Holyhead). However, he returned from Ireland via Parkgate in August 1742.

As the Dee silted up even more, Parkgate became unusable as a port and was superseded by the port of Liverpool, on the nearby River Mersey. Towards the end of the 18th century, Parkgate was popular as a seaside resort with bathers, but this diminished as the sands of the estuary were consumed with grass. Sailing from Parkgate across the estuary to Bagillt was still possible in 1864, as there is a report of an accident in which the landlord of the Pengwern Arms and his brother were drowned when trying to land in rough sea conditions; three others survived. But as silting progressed, with no beach and no direct access to the sea, Parkgate could manage only small subsistence from fishing and shrimps. The silting of the Dee has been accelerated by the deliberate introduction of the invasive colonising grass &quot;Sporobolus anglicus&quot; in Connah&#x27;s Quay in 1928, resulting in the growth of extensive marshlands.

Mostyn House School, a striking black-and-white building, was opened in Parkgate in 1855. From 1862 until it closed in 2010, it was run by the Grenfell family, most recently as an independent co-educational day school. Sir Wilfred Grenfell (1865–1940), a medical missionary to Newfoundland and Labrador, was born in Parkgate and was a pupil at the school. The 6th Duke of Westminster&#x27;s children attended Mostyn House, including his son the 7th Duke.

During the Second World War, two of Parkgate&#x27;s houses which contained cellars were converted into air raid shelters for public protection from German bombing. Small lights were placed on the marsh to trick German bombers into thinking settlements were there. After the war, Parkgate flourished as a desirable residential area. The surrounds became a conservation area in 1973.

== Notable buildings ==
A row of three houses – one formerly a butcher&#x27;s shop – overlooking the anchorage was built in the early 18th century for the Mostyn estate; they are Grade II* listed. The chapel of Mostyn House School, built in 1895 in red brick and terracotta, is also Grade II* listed.

The Anglican Church of St. Thomas was built in 1843 as a Congregational chapel. It reopened for worship in May 2010, having been closed since it was declared unsafe in 1994.

==Community==
An affluent village, it is popular with tourists and birdwatchers. During seasonal high tides, the water reaches the sea wall and visitors come to the village to witness the unusual sight. Birdwatchers also come at this time to see the birds usually hidden in the grasses of the marshland. A popular location is the Old Baths site, to the north of the village, from which the marshes can be viewed from a parked vehicle. Sightings are recorded daily on a local website which covers the whole Dee Estuary.

The marshlands of Parkgate are managed by the RSPB as part of the Dee Estuary Nature Reserve. In March 2022, an area of around of reedbed was destroyed by a fire, thought to have been started deliberately.

<doc id="1080869" wikidata="Q7440290" url="?curid=1080869" title="Seacombe">
<text>Seacombe () is a district of the town of Wallasey, on the Wirral Peninsula, England. Administratively, Seacombe is a ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in Merseyside. Before local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974, it was part of the County Borough of Wallasey, within the geographical county of Cheshire. At the 2001 Census, the population of Seacombe was 15,158, (7,081 males and 8,077 females), increasing to 15,387 (7,554 males, 7,833 females) at the Census 2011.

==History==
Seacombe is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Seccum.

In 1845 George Turnbull was the civil engineer who designed and built the Seacombe Wall sea defence that helped drain the marshes behind the town.

Seacombe was originally a terminus for the Wirral Railway; however, passenger services ended on 4 January 1960 and all services on the line terminated on 16 June 1963. Much of the line to Seacombe station was used as the approach road to the Kingsway Tunnel.

==Geography==
Seacombe is situated to the north-east of the Wirral Peninsula, adjoining the River Mersey to the east. Seacombe is less than south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton and about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Caldy. The area is at an elevation of between above sea level.

==Notable features==
Seacombe is dominated by three landmarks. The first of these is one of the terminals for the Mersey Ferry, the legendary &quot;Ferry &#x27;cross the Mersey&quot; described by Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers. The ferry travels in a triangular route between the Seacombe, Woodside and Liverpool Pier Head terminals. The second landmark is the parish church of St Paul. The third is a building housing some of the ventilation systems for the Kingsway Tunnel, a colossal structure which faces the river. It consists of two huge grilles which resemble stereo speakers, and a central concrete flue-like structure. This building has an almost identical counterpart on the Liverpool side of the river.

Seacombe was also home to Spaceport, a space-themed visitor attraction situated near the ferry terminal. Spaceport was opened on 26 July 2005 by Merseytravel Chairman Cllr Mark Dowd. It closed at the end of 2019 due to large financial losses. In November 2022 a new children&#x27;s attraction, Eureka! Science + Discovery opened at the same site and welcomed 100,000 visitors in its first year.

Wallasey Town Hall is situated in Seacombe. It is a Grade II listed building. During World War I it was used as a military hospital. 

Seacombe is also the location of Guinea Gap Baths. It is the oldest swimming pool in the Wirral, with the first swimming club being founded in the 1890s. It was originally filled with sea water, being so close to the River Mersey.

The nearest school to Seacombe Ferry is Riverside Primary School. The school has over 200 pupils and over 25 staff. The school&#x27;s Latin motto is &quot;Da Totem Habes!&quot;, translated as &quot;Give it all you&#x27;ve got!&quot;

==Popular culture==
The area was immortalised in the title of &quot;Party Seacombe&quot;, an instrumental by George Harrison on his &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot; album. 

Michael Portillo lived briefly in Seacombe in 2003 for the BBC TV programme &quot;When Michael Portillo became a Single Mum&quot;, which saw the former Conservative MP experience life as a single parent (he also worked in the Asda superstore in Wallasey).

== Notable people ==
Falkland Road in Seacombe, which runs from Brighton Street to Liscard Road, is the birthplace of the writer, peace campaigner and philosopher Olaf Stapledon, (1886 - 1950), author of &quot;Last and First Men&quot; and &quot;Star Maker&quot;. Stapledon&#x27;s birth certificate gives his place of birth as &quot;Poolton (sic) - cum - Seacombe&quot;. The prominent Welsh dramatist, literary critic and politician, Saunders Lewis, was born in 61 Falkland Road on 15 October 1893. Marjorie Cottle, pioneer female motorcyclist was born in the town in 1900.

<doc id="1080870" wikidata="Q837946" url="?curid=1080870" title="Wodao">
<text>The wodao () is a Chinese sword from the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty. It is typically long and slender, but heavy, with a curved back and sharp blade. It bears a strong resemblance to the Tang sword, &quot;zhanmadao&quot;, &quot;tachi&quot; or &quot;ōdachi&quot; in form. Extant examples show a handle approximately long, with a gently curved blade long.

The Chinese word &quot;wo&quot; literally means &quot;Japanese&quot;, so &quot;wodao&quot; literally means &quot;Japanese sword&quot;. The term &quot;wodao&quot; sometimes refers to Japanese swords, but it mainly refers to similar swords developed in China with Japanese swords used as reference. Chinese &quot;wodao&quot; was developed based on the Japanese sword used by the &quot;wokou&quot; pirates, a mixed group of Japanese and Chinese who repeatedly looted in the Chinese coast. Qi Jiguang (1528-1588 AD), a general of the Ming Dynasty, studied &quot;wokou&quot;&#x27;s tactics and Japanese swords to repel &quot;wokou&quot; pirates. General Qi also wrote a military book named &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot; which depicted, among other things, the detailed usage of the &quot;wodao&quot;. He also included a wodao branch in his army alongside branches of other weapons. Another Ming general Li Chengxun (李承勋), in his own revised edition of &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot; of 1588, quoted General Qi as saying that the long sword (believed to be referring to the &quot;ōdachi&quot; and &quot;tachi&quot;) was introduced into China during the &quot;wokou&quot; invasion of the Ming dynasty.

The Chinese martial art of wielding the wodao is believed to be a combination of medieval Japanese sword fighting styles and traditional Chinese techniques regarding the use of two-handed weapons. The term &quot;wodao&quot; was still in usage in China until the Qing dynasty as evidenced in various Chinese novels at the time.

In 1921, the Chinese warlord Cao Kun created a branch in his army that specialized in wielding two-handed single edged blades and called it the &quot;miaodao&quot; branch. Since then, &quot;miaodao&quot; became the name for this form of Chinese two-handed single edged blade and the term &quot;wodao&quot; is now rarely used. The art of wielding the &quot;miaodao&quot; can be traced back to the lineage of &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot;.

<text>Mors Principium Est (Latin for &quot;death is the beginning&quot;) is a Finnish melodic death metal band formed in 1999.

== History ==
The band was formed in 1999 in Pori, Finland by singer/lead guitarist Jori Haukio, guitarist Jarkko Kokko and keyboardist Toni Nummelin. Drummer Mikko Sipola joined in late 1999, soon followed by the arrival of new vocalist Ville Viljanen in early 2000 when Haukio decided to focus on his guitar work. Bassist Teemu Heinola was not appointed until after the band&#x27;s first demo, &quot;Before Birth&quot;, which attracted attention from French record label Listenable Records in 2001.

One year and two demos later, Mors Principium Est signed a three-album contract with Listenable Records completed by the album &quot;Liberation = Termination&quot; released in March 2007.

The band announced on 25 April 2007 the new lineup of the band. Karri Kuisma joined the band as the rhythm guitarist in 2006 and lead guitarist Tomy Laisto joined the band in 2007. Jarkko Kokko will still be a member of M.P.E. but he will not play any live shows.

In March 2011, the band stated that members Tomy Laisto and Kalle Aaltonen had parted ways to pursue other ventures. The band stated &quot;If we still want to continue with Mors Principium Est, we need new guitar players&quot; and proceeded to ask for anyone who could try out around the world to do so.

On 30 April 2011, the band announced on their website that Andy Gillion had been recruited as the first replacement guitarist. On 29 September 2011 the band announced on their website that Andhe Chandler had been recruited as the second replacement guitarist.

In April 2012, the band signed a new deal with AFM Records, with the first single for fourth album &quot;...And Death Said Live&quot; being released in October of the same year, followed by an album release in December in Japan, then a United States release in January 2013. The band&#x27;s deal with AFM would continue with &quot;Dawn of the 5th Era&quot; in 2014, &quot;Embers of a Dying World&quot; in 2017, and &quot;Seven&quot; in 2020.

In June 2021, the band announced that they had parted ways with Andy Gillion, with Gillion being unaware of his removal. In February 2022, the band would announce a compilation album of rerecorded material called &quot;Liberate the Unborn Inhumanity&quot;, with a new rendition of &quot;The Lust Called Knowledge&quot; from their debut album &quot;Inhumanity&quot; being released on the same day. The album would later be released on April of the same year.

<text>Roby is a village and electoral ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, Merseyside, England. Part of the wider built-up-area of Huyton-with-Roby with Huyton, Roby is effectively a dormitory village or suburb of the adjacent City of Liverpool. At the 2021 Census, the population of Roby electoral ward was 9,353.

Historically in Lancashire, Roby was part of the hundred of West Derby, an ancient subdivision of Lancashire covering the south-west of the county, as a broadly rural village and township within the Parish of Huyton. In the 1890&#x27;s Roby became part of the wider Huyton with Roby Urban District &amp; civil parish.

Growing industrialisation of the region during the industrial revolution brought brought the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to Roby at the Roby railway station in 1830.

==History==
Roby grew from a tenth-century Norse settlement named &quot;Rabil&quot;, meaning &quot;boundary farm/village&quot;. Roby is therefore mentioned, as &quot;Rabil&quot;, in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. In 1351, it became part of the Barony of Widnes and subsequently merged into the Duchy of Lancaster. In 1894 Roby was included in the Huyton with Roby Urban District. On the abolition of the administrative county of Lancashire in 1974, the urban district was also abolished and its former area was transferred to Merseyside to be combined with that of other districts to form the present-day metropolitan borough of Knowsley.

==Governance==
Since 1974 the village and ward have been administered by Knowsley Borough Council.

==Geography==
The area is located within a green belt area of Merseyside and partly consists of detached houses and private roads such as Wynwood Park. It has a golf course situated in nearby Bowring Park by the M62 motorway and Roby Road.

A new instated sign marks Roby by the Bowring Park Golf Course, including Roby Station and Roby Road within its location.

==Transport==
Roby railway station is situated on the Liverpool City Line, between the stations of Broadgreen and Huyton.

==TV and radio==

<doc id="1080881" wikidata="Q2629714" url="?curid=1080881" title="Academia pro Interlingua">
<text>The Academia pro Interlingua was an organization dedicated to the promotion of international auxiliary languages, and is associated in particular with Giuseppe Peano&#x27;s language Latino sine flexione (Latin without inflections).

The &quot;Academia&quot; was a descendant of the &quot;Kadem bevünetik volapüka&quot; (International Academy of Volapük) created at a Volapük congress in Munich in August 1887. Under Waldemar Rosenberger, who became the director in 1892, this group had transformed Volapük into Idiom Neutral and changed its name to &quot;Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal&quot; in 1898.

When the &quot;Akademi&quot; effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Latino sine flexione in 1908, it elected Peano as its director, and the name of the group was changed to &quot;Academia pro Interlingua&quot; since &quot;Interlingua&quot; was an alternative name for Peano&#x27;s language. The original &quot;Academia pro Interlingua&quot; survived until about 1939.

The official journals of the &quot;Academia&quot; were &quot;Discussiones&quot; (1909–13), &quot;Circulares&quot; (1915–24), and &quot;Academia pro Interlingua&quot; (1925–27). They have been recently published in a CD-Rom by the mathematics department of the university of Turin. They show a collective attempt to propagate, in a democratic way, an international language to facilitate the scientific reports among nations, favouring the progress of civilization and culture.

== Concerning Interlingua de IALA (IA) ==

Today the name Interlingua often refers to a different language presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA). Advocates for IA currently use, among others, the name &quot;Academia pro Interlingua&quot;.

<text>Eastham is a village and an electoral ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in Merseyside, England. Historically (until 1974), it was part of Cheshire. It is situated on the Wirral Peninsula, to the south of Bromborough and to the east of Willaston.

At the 2001 census, it had a population of 12,250, although the total ward population for the village stood at 13,637 In 2011, the villages population was not measured separately but a review was carried out for the ward. The total population had risen to 13,882.

== History ==
Eastham is cited as one of the oldest villages on the Wirral Peninsula and has been inhabited since Anglo Saxon times. The name derives from its location: &quot;ham&quot; (&quot;home&quot;) situated to the east of Willaston, which was then the principal settlement. 
The original village is clustered around St. Mary&#x27;s Church, whose churchyard contains an ancient yew tree. Much of the surrounding land was once owned by the powerful Stanley family.

Since the Middle Ages, a ferry service operated across the River Mersey between Eastham and Liverpool, the early ferries being run by monks from the Abbey of St. Werburgh. By the late 1700s, up to 40 coaches each day arrived at a newly built pier, carrying passengers and goods for the ferry. Paddle steamers were introduced in 1816 to replace the sailing boats, but the demand for a service declined in the 1840s with the opening of a railway link between Chester and Birkenhead Woodside Ferry. In 1846, the owner of the ferry, Thomas Stanley, built the Eastham Ferry Hotel and shortly after, the Pleasure Gardens were added to attract more visitors. The gardens were landscaped with rhododendrons, azaleas, ornamental trees and fountains. Attractions included a zoo, with bears, lions, monkeys and antelope, an open-air stage, tea rooms, bandstand, ballroom, boating lake, water chute.

Entertainers performed in the gardens during summer, and included Blondin, the famous tight-rope walker who once wheeled a local boy across a high wire in a wheelbarrow. In 1894, the Manchester Ship Canal was opened by Queen Victoria, bringing added prosperity to the area and a Jubilee Arch was built at the entrance to the Pleasure Gardens in 1897 to commemorate her Diamond Jubilee.

In 1854 the American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, whilst in the position of United States consul in Liverpool, visited Eastham and declared it to be: &quot;the finest old English village I have seen, with many antique houses, and with altogether a rural and picturesque aspect, unlike anything in America, and yet possessing a familiar look, as if it were something I had dreamed about.&quot;

In its heyday Eastham Ferry was known as the &#x27;Richmond of the Mersey&#x27;, but its popularity declined during the 1920s and the last paddle steamer crossing took place in 1929. The Pleasure Gardens fell into disrepair during the 1930s and the iron pier and Jubilee Arch were later dismantled. 
In 1970, to commemorate European Conservation Year, the area was designated a Woodland &amp; Country Park and today, it is once more a popular place of recreation.

In 1951 the civil parish had a population of 5598. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

== Geography ==
Eastham is the southernmost area of the Merseyside part of Wirral, lying within a green belt area bordering Merseyside and Cheshire, adjacent to the River Mersey. It is located close to the M53 motorway, and lies directly on the A41 road, the main road between Birkenhead and Birmingham. It is also close to the city of Chester and shares a proximity to the village of Port Sunlight, an historic centre for the British soap industry. It is situated a particularly short distance away from Willaston village.

==Open spaces==
As well as Eastham Country Park and Woods, the Lowfields, close to Eastham Rake Station, is the start of a guided walk suggested by Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council, following Dibbinsdale Brook and leads onto the Wirral Way.

Dibbinsdale is a local nature reserve and Dibbinsdale Brook and Clatter Brook run through the Brookhurst area of Eastham and into Bromborough. There is also a private golf club, Eastham Lodge, a mature parkland course with views across the River Mersey.

Near to the village centre is a small public area called Torr Park, Which is home to the village cricket club. It was founded by the Stanley family as an area for recreation. In the present day the park offers tennis courts, a children&#x27;s play area and a cricket field.

At 8.45 am each morning a siren is heard. It is said to be based in the Queen Elizabeth II dock who use it as their fire alarm and test it each morning. It has the distinct sound of a World War II siren and has been sounded each morning for at least 50 years.

==Transport==
Eastham Locks form the western end of the Manchester Ship Canal, and is the largest lock in the UK . In order to provide berthing facilities for large tankers that could not be accommodated on the canal due to size, the Queen Elizabeth II Dock was constructed, with vehicular access from Ferry Road.

Eastham Rake railway station opened in 1995 on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network.

<doc id="1080889" wikidata="Q719974" url="?curid=1080889" title="Nissan Sentra">
<text>The Nissan Sentra is a series of automobiles manufactured by the Japanese automaker Nissan since 1982. Since 1999, the Sentra has been categorized as a compact car, while previously it occupied the subcompact class. Until 2006, Sentra was a rebadged export version of the Japanese Nissan Sunny, but since the 2013 model year, Sentra is a rebadged export version of the Sylphy. The Sentra nameplate is not used in Japan. Many other countries in Latin America sell their versions of the Sunny as the Sentra. In Mexico, the first three generations of the Sentra were known as the Nissan Tsuru (Japanese for crane), and the B13 model was sold under that name until 2017, alongside the updated models badged as Sentra.

In North America, the Sentra currently serves as Nissan&#x27;s compact car, despite being rated as a mid-size car by the EPA due to its interior volume since the 2007 model year. While previous Sentras were subcompacts, the Sentra has grown over the years, with the Nissan Versa having replaced the Sentra in the entry-level area.

The Sentra name was created for Nissan by Ira Bachrach of NameLab, and Bachrach describes the origin as &quot;Nissan wanted consumers to understand that it was quite safe even though it was small. The word Sentra sounds like central as well as sentry, which evokes images of safety.&quot;


== First generation (B11; 1982) ==
The first generation of the Nissan Sentra was introduced in the United States in May 1982 as a direct replacement for the Datsun 310. The model was initially imported from Japan, where it was produced at Zama plant. Available in four body styles (two-door sedan, four-door sedan, five-door wagon and three-door hatchback coupe), it was the second car to be marketed in the United States under the nameplate of Nissan and using a model name instead of a number. The first one was the Nissan Stanza, introduced at the 1981 New York International Auto Show as a 1982 model. While previous Sunny models had used a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, the B11 Sentra was the first to use a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. Engine choice was the (E15) 1.5 L four-cylinder SOHC, replacing the old A-Series OHV. This featured semi-hemispherical combustion chambers, high-swirl intake ports and a semi-dual exhaust manifold to provide strong torque at low and medium rpm ranges. Torque peak was at 3200 rpm. Transmission options were a four-speed manual, 5-speed manual or a three-speed automatic with lock-up torque converter. Drag coefficient was 0.39 for the coupe and 0.40 for 2- and 4-door sedans.

At the time of its release, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave the Sentra MPG the highest gasoline mileage for gasoline powered cars marketed at that time, 43 miles per gallon in city and 58 miles per gallon in highway, a combined 48 miles per gallon. Curb weight of only 1875 pounds helped it to achieve that number. The Sentra MPG featured a three-way exhaust catalyst and an electronically controlled fuel metering unit to monitor the air-fuel mixture automatically and make adjustments to boost fuel mileage.

Trim levels were Standard, Deluxe, and XE, while price ranges were between US$4,949 for the base two-door sedan up to US$6,899 for the two-door XE hatchback coupe. Standard equipment on all models were four-wheel independent suspension, front disc brakes and rear drums, rack and pinion steering, maintenance-free battery, a rear ashtray, and bucket seats. Deluxe models added halogen headlamps, a remote-locking gas filler door, a carpeted trunk, and a rear wiper washer on the wagon. Deluxe and XE offered tinted glass, trip odometer, a vanity mirror, dual remote mirrors, and door trim. XE offered cut pile carpeting, an analog quartz clock, remote rear window opener, a low-fuel warning light, an AM-FM Clarion stereo radio, power steering, a tachometer, and 155/13 whitewall radial tires. A sunroof was available as an option.

In its first year of sales, the Sentra became the best-selling import in the U.S. and the fourth best-selling passenger car overall (together with the earlier 210), with 191,312 units sold of both cars. The Sentra ended the 1983 year as the eighth-most sold passenger car, with 209,889 units.

The 1983 model-year introduced a 1.7 L CD17 diesel inline-four, mated with a four-speed manual transmission. Also, the 1.5 L was replaced by a 1.6 L E16 as the standard engine, available with a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic. Later that year the Sentra also received an electronically controlled carburetor.

In April 1985, Nissan started production of the Sentra in the Smyrna, Tennessee plant, after a US$85 million investment. The only body style manufactured in the US was the two-door sedan. The 1985 model-year received aerodynamically styled headlamps, a revised grille and blackwall tires. An SE option was introduced as two-door hatchback model, with alloy wheels, black lower body paint and black out grille. An automatic transmission was optional on all Sentras except the two-door base sedan, MPG Diesel and SE coupe. Prices were starting at US$5,499 (~$ in ). The diesel engine was discontinued in the U.S. market soon thereafter. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine ranked the B11 reliability as &quot;better than average&quot; in 1985.

The B11 model was ranked the seventh safest car in a ranking made by the Center for Auto Safety in 1983, which examined the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) testing, consisting of frontal crashes at 35 miles per hour.

=== Mexico ===
In 1984, the Sentra entered production in Nissan Mexicana&#x27;s Cuernavaca plant as the Nissan Tsuru. It was built there until 1987 when it was replaced by the next generation; in total 210,565 of the first Tsuru were built in Mexico.

== Second generation (B12; 1986) ==
===United States/Canada===
This generation carried on the multitude of body styles that the B11 had, including a station wagon, two-door or four-door sedan, three-door hatchback and the hatchback-bodied Sport Coupé. While the B12 chassis was first produced and marketed in 1985 in most parts of the world, it was not offered to the United States until August 1986, for the 1987 model year. The two-door sedan model of the previous generation Sentra (a bodystyle no longer offered outside of North America) was the only bodystyle built in Nissan&#x27;s Smyrna, Tennessee plant, representing about 22 percent of Sentra sales in North America in 1986. With the new generation, the plant underwent a five-month conversion and when production of the B12 Sentra began on August 12, 1986, it was also built as a four-door sedan. In December, the three-door Hatchback bodystyle was added to the US production, followed by the station wagon bodystyle in January 1987.

The B12 carried over a radically modified 4-wheel independent suspension from the B11, with all-wheel disc brakes an option in some parts of the world. This was the start of the model classes which were standard through the 2003 model year (not all classes were available every year) having the E as the base-level economy car, the XE as the next-up model, the GXE as the top level for the 4-door sedan (and wagon), and the sporty SE coupe. The GXE (available from 1987 to 2003) had a body colored bumper, aero side mirrors with manual remote control, tachometer as well as standard 13&quot; 175/70R13 alloy wheels along with air-conditioning, variable intermittent wipers, but no standard cassette deck nor any power windows/locks/mirrors. The SE also had dual mirrors, air conditioning, tachometer, and power door locks and windows in some markets and possibly electronic fuel injection.

The B12 chassis would be the last chassis to offer a station wagon model. Even more rare are the four-wheel drive versions of the station wagon, offered as an option for the 1987 (late introduction), 1988, and 1989 model years. These models featured an electrically activated single-range transfer case to drive the independently suspended rear wheels, making the car a selectable four-wheel-drive (not all-wheel-drive) vehicle. Sales were mediocre, totalling 429 in calendar year 1986, 2,050 in 1987, 2,408 in 1988, and a final 892 deliveries in 1989.

All 1987 Sentras came standard with the E16 engine with , excepting the Sport Coupé and the later four-wheel-drive wagon, which received the throttle-body-injected E16i engine with identical power output. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed automatic available as an option. In 1988, all Sentras had the E16i, which was offered for this year with throttle body injection (TBI). In many parts of the world the E-series soldiered on in the B12 chassis with some versions getting the multi-point fuel injection E16E engine. From 1989 to 1990, the only engine choice was the GA16i, a 12-valve SOHC predecessor of the GA16DE. Transaxles offered were the 4- and 5-speed manuals (RN4F31A and RS5F31A, respectively) and a 3-speed automatic with torque converter lockup (RL3F01A).

The 1987 Sentra earned a 1-star out of 5 rating for the driver in the NHTSA 35-mph full frontal crash test, the lowest possible. Nissan rectified this problem with the 1988 and later models, which earned a 3-star rating.

1989 saw a subtle change in the body style of the Sentra sedan, as new larger, more rounded front corner lights were introduced to the front fenders and redesigned taillights were added to the rear fascia (station wagon retained same rear lights). The Nissan logo on the front grille was relocated from the right hand side to the center. In 1990, electrically retracted front shoulder belts were added (for the US market only), as well as three-point harnesses for the outboard, rear seat passengers.

The Sport Coupe was a sportier style of the Sentra. It shared none of the body components with the standard model and was always imported from Japan, rather than being built in Tennessee. It was only available with the E16i or GA16i. All Sport Coupes had dual sway bars, dual remote-adjust mirrors, and a tachometer instrument cluster. The SE model added features like air conditioning and rear speakers. All B12 Sentras use the same wiring harness, regardless of the options installed on any particular vehicle.

In Canada, the B12 four-door sedan remained available through the 1993 model year. Essentially a rebadged, Mexican-built Nissan Tsuru II, it was called &quot;Sentra Classic&quot; to distinguish it from the B13 model released for 1991. It replaced the Nissan Micra 3/5-door hatchbacks as Nissan&#x27;s Canadian market price-leader model as they were discontinued at the same time. All 1991–1993 &quot;Classic&quot; models came with the E16i and the choice of two transmissions, a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, this car was sold with Sentra badging and the four-door sedan or three-door hatchback coupé bodywork. Aside from not being fitted with any emissions controls to speak of, specifications were closer to a Japanese/global market Sunny than to the North American Sentra. The Sentra received the 1.3-liter E13 engine or the 1.6-liter E16, with fuel injection fitted to the top-of-the-line SGLi (sedan) and GXEi (coupé) models. A limited number were also manufactured with the larger, 1.8-liter 16V twin cam CA18DE engine. Torque is at 5200 rpm. Production of this model were 720 units, although this number remains unsubstantiated.

===Latin America===
In Mexico, it was named the Nissan Tsuru II, available in 2, 4-door sedans and wagon, while the Coupé was named the Nissan Hikari. They were produced and marketed locally between 1988 and 1991. For 1988 for the 4 door Tsuru II and the Hikari had available the Turbo EGI (fuel injected) 1.6 L engine in a very rare, sporty version. It was one of the most reliable cars in its time in Mexico, being a great sales success. 343,263 of the Tsuru II were built in Mexico between 1987 and 1991. This generation was also exported to some Central and South American markets such as Peru, Chile and Bolivia. In Chile the Mexican-made car received &quot;Sentra&quot; badging and was available from October 1987 until 1993. The Sentra was the most sold car in the country in 1991 and 1992.

In the Philippines, it was initially offered in three trims namely the 1.7 DX (diesel), 1.3 SLX and the 1.5 SGX, the wagon version was also available in the 1.5 SGX trim and was simply called the Nissan California. In mid 1989, the Sentra model line was freshened up and the engines were upgraded to 1.4- (LX) and 1.6-liter. The 1.6 SGX gained power steering, windows, door locks and side mirrors, a first in its class. The second-generation B12 also had a diesel variant which had the 1.7 CD17 engine. The second wagon version (known as Nissan California 1.6 SGX) also had all power features.


== Third generation (B13; 1990) ==
The sedan featured the fuel-injected 110- and 1.6-liter 16-valve 4-cylinder GA16DE engine. It came in the base model, E, XE, SE, and GXE. The GXE came with a power package such as power windows/locks/mirrors while the XE, SE, SE-R came with standard or optional sunroof and alloy wheels. In the United States, the four-door models came with front motorized shoulder seat belts, while the two-door models came with automatic front door-mounted 3-point seat belts. The short-lived three-door hatchback of the B12 Sentra was not replaced in this generation, and the sporting coupé version was replaced by the ovoid Nissan NX.

For the 1992 model year (August 1991 – July 1992 production), a passenger&#x27;s side vanity mirror and black body-side moldings became standard on the Sentra 2-door. The Value Option Package (air conditioning, cruise control, and a stereo system) was extended to SE models. The optional three-speed automatic in the E coupe was dropped and gained an optional 4-speed automatic, shared with other models.

=== Facelift ===
From August 1992 production, the B13 received a facelift for the 1993 model year, with revised front and rear fascias. A driver&#x27;s airbag was also made standard on the GXE and was available optionally on other models for 1993. An XE Limited model was added for both the coupe and sedan.

For 1994 models (August 1993 production), a CFC-free refrigerant became standard on models equipped with air conditioning. XE models got more standard equipment that included air conditioning, cruise control and a stereo cassette player. The XE Limited was dropped for 1994. In May 1994, a 1994.5 &quot;Limited&quot; model was released as a placeholder for a delayed replacement, due in early 1995.

=== Sentra SE-R ===
The B13 used Nissan&#x27;s &quot;SR20DE&quot; engine in the sporty two-door SE-R model, offering at 6400 rpm and of torque at 4800 rpm—and accelerating from 0 to in 7.6 seconds with a quarter-mile time of 15.8 seconds. Features included 4-wheel disc brakes, MacPherson strut independent suspension, viscous limited-slip differential. The B13 SE-R returned city/ highway.

=== Philippines ===
The B13 was released in JX, LEC, EX Saloon, Super Saloon and SE Saloon variants. The Super Saloon had all power features. The SE-Saloon came as a Limited edition equipped with four-wheel disc brakes and ABS. Both SE and Super Saloon come standard with the GA16DE.

The B13 SuperSaloon and SE Saloon came with the GA16DE fuel-injected engine (top-of-the-line engine for the Philippine market) which is comparable to the U.S Spec B13 SE Limited with loaded options. These models are not equipped with emissions equipment – catalytic converters and sensors as well as EGR. B13s were sold new from 1990 to 2000. The LEC version comes with the standard GA13 carbureted engine as well as the LEC Ps (Power Steering model). The JX comes with the GA14 carbureted engine.

=== Nissan Tsuru GS/V16/Sentra (1992–2017) ===
The Mexican-built Sentra B13 was sold in Mexico for 25 years as well as parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Central America and South America. It is known as the Nissan Tsuru in Mexico, Nissan V16 in Chile, Sentra B13 in Central and South American countries, and Sentra Clásico in Peru and the Dominican Republic. Tsuru vehicles destined for the Mexican market were modified by Nissan Mexicana specifically for the Mexican market and for the most part are identical to the 1991 model except for a new Renault-sourced clutch/transmission, updated Mexican-made electronic systems and minor cosmetic and ergonomic upgrades.

The Tsuru was the most popular car in Mexico from 1997 until 2011 when it was surpassed by the Mexican-made Volkswagen Jetta. The Middle East/African export market version is the same basic car only with minor cosmetic changes and mechanical downgrades to make it cheaper, such as non-power steering, downgraded interior trim, a downgraded braking system, and a mechanical clutch instead of a hydraulic one.

Vehicles sold in the Middle East region are not equipped with catalytic converters to make the car cheaper to build. Because of the lack of the catalytic converter, the vehicles are illegal in Mexico and South America. More recent models have received a Renault-built hydraulic clutch and an optional catalytic converter. Its affordable price, relatively good fuel economy, easy servicing and ease of finding spare parts for it made it popular among local taxi drivers and low income families in Mexico, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Tsuru is commonly used in the taxicab livery in Mexico as a replacement for the VW Beetle. Due to stricter automobile safety regulations which came into effect in Mexico from 2019, production of the Tsuru was discontinued in May 2017 since the Tsuru lacked both anti-lock brakes and airbags. A special commemorative edition limited to 1000 cars went on sale in March 2017, by which time 1,849,289 third generation Tsurus had been built in Mexico.

==== Safety ====
The Tsuru/Sentra in its most basic configuration with no airbags for Latin America received 0 stars for adult occupants and 0 stars for infants from Latin NCAP in 2013.
== Fourth generation (B14; 1995) ==
Introduced on January 5, 1995, the Sentra changed from an independent rear suspension to a torsion beam setup. Some variants were not equipped with a rear swaybar or rear disc brakes. Many of these vehicles equipped with the 1.6-liter DOHC engine that had Nissan&#x27;s Variable Intake Valve Timing Control System (NVTCS) and standard 5-speed manual transmission can achieve upwards of 30–40 MPG depending on conditions. This generation is also the first generation in Mexico wearing the Sentra name. It is also the first Sentra generation exclusively sold in sedan form, as the coupe was dropped in favour of the Nissan 200SX reintroduction. The revived 200SX also replaced the related Nissan NX.

All engines in the B14 line up came with timing chains, designed to last the vehicle&#x27;s lifetime.

The B14 Sentra platform was offered several trims, Base, XE, GXE, GLE, SE and SE Limited. Base and XE come with 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps, GXE prior to 1998 also included 13-inch wheels. The only difference between trims is the GXE and up, come with rear seat trunk access, rear headrests, a grip-assist handle on the passenger side, additional fabric on doors and seats as opposed to vinyl, power windows, locks, mirrors, etc. 
The GLE, SE, and Special Edition include in some instances leather, rear spoiler and moonroof, and keyless entry packages. 

All trims except the SE and SE-R have the GA16DE 1.6 L engine producing and . The SE and SE-R received the SR20DE 2.0L engine with . The 200SX SE-R came with leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob and even Limited-Slip-Differential until 1997.

===SE===
The sedan got all the performance parts (minus the limited-slip differential) in 1998 with the Sentra SE. The SE sedan came with the same 2.0-liter SR20DE engine as the SE-R. This generation saw the end of assembly in Smyrna, Tennessee.

===Engines===
* GA16DE: 1.6 (1,597 cc) DOHC with a 6,900 rpm redline and at 6,000 rpm, 110 lb.ft at 4,000 rpm, available in 5-speed manual/4-speed automatic; 30/40mpg 5sp. man., 28/37 4sp. auto. Acceleration 0–60 mph in 8.5 seconds for a 95 GXE M/T.
* SR20DE: 2.0 (1,998 cc) DOHC with a 7,300 rpm redline and at 6,400 rpm, 132 lb.ft at 4,800 rpm in SE and 200SX SE-R; 23/31mpg 5-speed manual, 23/30 4-speed automatic, 0–60 mph in 8.1 seconds.

===Year-to-year changes===
* 1995: Base, XE, GXE, Top of line GLE
:The 1995 model saw a minor redesign of the rear light assembly.
* 1996:
* 1997: Base, XE, GXE, top-of-the-line GLE
* 1998: Base, XE, GXE, (new) SE, GLE
:The 1998 model year saw a minor redesign of the rear light assembly, primarily the reverse indicator lights. The front grille was changed in 1998 from horizontal bars to a large plastic mesh. In 1998 the GXE was upgraded to include 14-inch alloy wheels, the GLE also came with 14-inch wheels, and the SE and Special editions along with the 200SX SE-R came with 15-inch alloy rims.
* 1999: XE, (Limited Edition) for GXE, SE
:In 1999, the front grille was redesigned yet again, this time changed from a grille to an oval slot low between the headlights.

===Philippine version (1995–2002)===
*FE – GA13DS: 1,295 cc DOHC 16-valve carburetor (power steering only, without stereo)

*EX Saloon – GA14DE: 1,392 cc DOHC 16-valve EFI (power steering only, with stereo)

*Super Saloon – GA16DNE: 1,597 cc DOHC 16-valve EFI (all power, power antenna) (auto retract mirrors, SRS airbags and ABS were optional at first and later became mandatory to all units)

Due to the success of the Super Saloon, Nissan Philippines introduced the Super Touring and GTS, to compete with the Toyota Corolla TRD (limited edition) and 160 hp Honda Civic SiR sedan.

*Super Touring – GA16DNE: with a sportier bodykit (Lucino bumpers with foglights, sideskirt, spoiler) power steering, power windows, auto retract mirrors

*GTS – GA16DNE: successor of the Super Touring (sporty bumpers, sideskirt and spoiler) all power features, all power, power steering, power windows, auto retract mirrors

Nissan Philippines then repackaged the Sentra to a more luxurious line up in order to compete with the Toyota Corolla Altis.

*Exalta SLA – GA16DE: with reinforced extended bumpers, multi-reflector headlamps, elm wood interior accents, all power features, power steering, power windows, rear backup sensors, sapphire starlight gauges, manual transmission

*Exalta STA – GA16DE: luxurious version of the SLA all power features, power steering, elm wood interior, power windows, all leather seats and door panels, power sliding sunroof, automatic climate control, 2-DIN stereo with 12-Disc CD Changer, fog lights, 4 channel 4 sensor ABS, tilt and slide sunroof, retracting rear door window shades, sapphire starlight gauges

== Fifth generation (B15; 1999) ==
The Sentra finally crossed over into the &quot;compact&quot; class when the redesigned model launched in February 2000 as a 2000 model. When new, this redesign was considered a substantial upgrade compared to the &quot;cheap&quot; economy car it replaced. Previously, the compact class had been occupied by the Altima, which moved to the mid-size class in 2001, and its wheelbase remained unchanged from the previous generation. While earlier Sentras were very similar to their Japan-market B-series Nissan Sunny twins, the B15 Sentra diverged greatly from the B15 Sunny (Nissan Super Sunny). Production shifted from Smyrna, Tennessee to Aguascalientes, Mexico, and the Smyrna production line was retooled to build the Nissan Xterra. The 2000–2001 Sentra SE with the SR20DE roller rocker motor, which has and of torque, occupied the top-of-the-line Sentra until the SE-R returned for model year 2002. The 1.6-liter GA16DE engine was dropped in favor of the 1.8 L QG18DE (1769 cc), rated at and . In Brazil, this engine generated at 5,600 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. Numerous upgrades were made over the previous generation. The new model featured a new interior with higher quality plastics and more comfortable seats. The exterior was also substantially updated and now featured body-side moldings and clear headlights. The curb weight on the QG18DE-engined Sentra is . With the introduction of the B15 in year 2000, Nissan also introduced a CA &#x27;Clean Air&#x27; trim only available in California. The CA trim boasts a double walled exhaust, three catalytic converters, quick catalyst warm up, and a radiator that has a special coating which actually changes ground level ozone (smog) into oxygen. The Sentra CA model is the only gasoline-fueled vehicle in the world to receive California Air Resources Board (CARB) super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) certification and obtain zero-emission credits.

In markets where the B15 Sentra or Sunny was not sold, Nissan usually sold a similar car called the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy (G10/N16) in Japan but under other names elsewhere. In Europe, the Bluebird Sylphy was known as the Nissan Almera (N16) and Australia and New Zealand as the Nissan Pulsar (N16). The G10/N16 is constructed on the same platform as the B15 and features the same interior and engines.

===SE-R===
For the 2002 model year, a new SE-R was introduced powered by the 2.5-liter &quot;QR25DE&quot; and 4-cylinder. The SE-R came with either a 5-speed RS5F51A manual transmission or an optional 4-speed automatic. The 5-speed manual was dropped in 2003+ models, which made the 4-speed automatic the only transmission choice for the SE-R. 

A more aggressive front fascia was added thanks to a Nissan Skyline inspired front bumper for 2002 models. Black housing headlights, fog-lights, side skirts, a rear spoiler, a dual-tip muffler, and 16&quot; aluminum-alloy wheels were also standard. This trim also featured a sport-tuned suspension, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and beige sport cloth seats.

===SE-R Spec V===
The Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V was the more performance oriented sport compact version of the Nissan Sentra. Its engine (also shared with the SE-R) was the same 2.5-liter QR25DE unit originally created for the Nissan Altima and Frontier pickups. Power output from the Spec V&#x27;s QR25 increased to at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm when using premium fuel. It is mated to a six-speed RS6F51H manual transmission and a helical limited slip differential; which served as the only transmission available on the Spec V.

The car&#x27;s handling was aided with more aggressive tuning of the car&#x27;s suspension (when compared to lower trim models) and the addition of low-profile 215/45-17-inch tires and 17x7inch wheels. A front strut tower brace, firmer springs, revised shock damping, firmer front polyurethane bushings, dual-tip muffler, and front stabilizer bars were all standard. A four-wheel anti-lock braking system (which was packaged with front-seat side-impact air bags) was also optional equipment on all 2002-2006 models. Specific to the 2004-2006 model years; potential buyers could also purchase a 4 piston Brembo brake caliper upgrade.

The Spec V was initially equipped with Red Skyline GT-R inspired front bucket seats (2002 model year only) and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other optional features included a Rockford Fosgate 300-watt nine-speaker audio system (with an sub woofer in the trunk), six-disc auto-changer, and a power sunroof. Features unique to the Spec V (and SE-R) include more aggressive headlights with black surrounds, standard fog-lights, lower-body sill extensions and a rear spoiler.

Exclusive to the 2002 and 2003 model years, the SE-R &amp; Spec V was given an aggressive front fascia (styled after the Skyline GT-R). Originally, speculation arose surrounding the Spec V designation being a play on the GT-R V-Spec Skyline name. This speculation has been proven to be true with the introduction of the R35 GT-R Spec V in North America. It is also widely speculated that use of the Spec V designation is due to the fact that Nissan cannot use the V-Spec title in the US market, however evidence has yet to surface.

===2.5 LE and 2.5 S===
The QR25DE engine was not exclusive to the SE-R versions of the Sentra, the 2.5L engine was also equipped in the 2003 Sentra 2.5 LE and 2004 Sentra 2.5 S. These versions did not sport any exterior resemblance to the SE-R/Spec V trims; they clone the exterior and interior of the lower trims (GXE, 1.8 S) to include clear headlamps, beige-colored interior cloth, and softer suspension than the SE-R&#x27;s. The only available transmission was a 4-speed automatic. These models offered the appearance of a standard Sentra coupled with the power of an SE-R.

===2004+ model year refresh===

In 2003, Nissan launched the 2004 model year which saw a minor facelift and a build quality uplift for all Sentras; not limited to but including updated headlights, tail lights, squared-off rear bumper, enlarged &quot;bucktooth&quot; front grill, and black faced gauges with orange lighting across all trims. 

====1.8 Special Edition====
The Special Edition was produced for model years 2005 and 2006. Exterior features included a rear spoiler, fog lights, SE-R-style front grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels borrowed from the SE-R. Interior features included a 320-watt six-disc Rockford Fosgate nine-speaker sound system, and a charcoal cloth interior and leather-wrapped wheel borrowed from the SE-R model. The only available engine was the QG18DE paired with either a four-speed automatic or a very limited quantity five-speed manual.

====SE-R/SE-R Spec V====
Transmission gearing and build quality was improved for the 2004–2006 SE-R Spec V which resulted in a quicker quarter-mile time of 15.2 seconds. The now automatic only SE-R (starting in MY2003) was capable of a quarter-mile time of 16.0 seconds. No significant exterior cosmetic changes were added to differentiate the SE-R model from the Spec V. The SE-R still retained its side-skirt extensions, rear spoiler, black housing headlights but had differing sets of wheels (16&quot; wheels on the SE-R were borrowed from the 1.8 Special Edition and 17x7 six spoke wheels signified the Spec V). The 2004 model year also featured a new style of tail-light which is reminiscent of the Skyline GT-R&#x27;s quadruple taillights, which notabily was a darker shade of red than the 1.8 based Sentra&#x27;s. Volcanic Orange, an exclusive color for the SE-R and Spec V trim became available for 2004–2006 models.

The interior was also redesigned. Starting in 2005, the SE-R embossed &quot;goose-neck&quot; shifter handle from the previous models was replaced by an all black, leather stitched ball-top shifter. The two-tone cloth seats found in 2003 and 2004 Spec V models was changed to all-black mesh for the 2005 &amp; 2006 model years.

A big brake option featuring Brembo four-piston calipers up front, 12&quot; vented front discs and upgraded 10.9&quot; rear discs were available for 2004–2006 Spec V models. ABS was unavailable with this option from the factory.

===NISMO parts catalog===
NISMO began offering S-Tune and R-Tune parts upgrades starting the 2004 model year via the NISMO parts catalog. These parts could be either installed by the dealer or the owner. 

S-Tune parts included but were not limited to:

* NISMO stainless cat-back exhaust
* NISMO springs and shocks 
* NISMO brake pads 
* NISMO 23mm front anti-roll bar
* NISMO 17x7.5&quot; wheels (which were Rays Gram Lights 57c&#x27;s with NISMO branding - Specifically made for the Sentra).

R-Tune parts were a combination of more aggressive engine, suspension and visual modifications such as: 
* NISMO 4-to-1 exhaust manifold 
* NISMO cold-air intake 
* NISMO front lower tie bar
* NISMO rear 25 mm anti-roll bar 
* NISMO camshafts 
* NISMO suspension hard bushing kit 
* NISMO rear spoiler 
* NISMO front and rear under spoiler/lip.

===Transmissions by trim===
* The 2000–2001 SE 2.0 L (SR20DE) and 2000-2006 1.8L (QG18DE) had the option of:
**An automatic 4-speed RE4F03B transmission 
**5-speed manual RS5F70A 
* The 2.5 LE, and 2.5S automatics equipped with the 2.5-liter (QR25DE) used the 4-speed RE4F04B transmission.
*SE-R&#x27;s were predominantly automatic and used the same RE4F04B transmission as the LE and 2.5S with the exception of the 2002 model year, that year the RS5F51A 5 speed manual open differential transmission was available.
* The 2002–2006 SE-R Spec Vs used the 6-speed RS6F51H transmission with a Helical limited slip differential (which had at least 2 revisions, 2002 models had different gearing from all the other years).
== Sixth generation (B16; 2006) ==
Nissan introduced the sixth generation Sentra at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January. Classified as a mid-size sedan by the EPA thanks to its interior passenger and cargo volume of 110 cubic feet (as the EPA considers &quot;mid&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; size a car with interior passenger and cargo volume between 110 and 119 cubic feet), the Sentra is bigger in every dimension than the B15 model, being 65 mm (2.3 in.) longer, 91 mm (3.2 in.) wider, and 113 mm (4.0 in.) taller. The wheelbase is also 167 mm (5.9 in.) longer than the previous model. The sixth generation also marked a change in Nissan&#x27;s North American lineup, with the Nissan Versa becoming brand&#x27;s entry-level model. This generation is based on the C platform architecture that also underpins the first-generation Nissan Rogue, Nissan Qashqai and also the T31 Nissan X-Trail, as well as other Renault models. The Sentra&#x27;s standard engine is a 2.0-liter 16-valve inline-four rated at and of torque. Fuel economy for with the 2.0L mated to the CVT is rated at 26 city/34 hwy, and the 6-speed manual at 24 city/31 hwy. SE-R is rated at 24 city/30 hwy with the CVT being the only transmission available. SE-R Spec-V is rated at 21 city/28 hwy mated with the 6-speed manual.

In 2007 and 2008, Nissan considered marketing a hybrid version of the Sentra, particularly when the price of oil rose to over $100 per barrel. However the price soon retreated below $40, and Nissan decided instead to focus on future hydrogen fuel cell and electric vehicles. Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has indicated that he will not attempt to match Toyota and Honda in terms of hybrid models offered for retail sale. This decision has left Nissan without a compact hybrid product to compete with Toyota Prius, the Honda Civic Hybrid, and relaunched Honda Insight. Nissan&#x27;s only hybrid product on the American market is the Altima Hybrid, which competes with the Toyota Camry Hybrid and the Ford Fusion Hybrid.

For 2010, the Sentra received a mid-cycle refresh. It revisions included a new, Altima-inspired grille, a revised lower fascia and slightly different headlights. In back, new taillights (though almost identical to previous years) and additional chrome trim pieces on the trunk and side moldings highlight the major changes. New trim lines are offered to balance out the prices. Inside is a new red back-lighting color for the speedometer and knobs, and a new CD player with an optional navigation system. The new audio system includes iPod and USB integration on certain models, as well as a backup camera. Fog lamps are no longer standard on the 2.0S and SL model and leather seats are now only available as an option rather than standard on the SL model for 2010, which is reflected in the new, lower MSRP. The Brazilian export variant features a flexible fuel engine and retractable side mirrors were adopted from the Nissan Versa.

The B16 generation was introduced in Argentina in 2010. Until March 2011, the Sentra has sold 948 units in Argentina.

The B16 Sentra was also introduced in the Philippines as the Sentra 200, with the &quot;200&quot; denoting the &quot;MR20DE&quot; engine. The name is also applied to differentiate itself to the Nissan Sylphy-based Sentra which was locally assembled in the country. All Sentra 200s were imported from Mexico.

===SE-R/SE-R Spec V (2007–2012)===

Nissan introduced a new version of the SE-R to the North American market for the 2007 model year. The SE-R is available in two versions: SE-R base and SE-R Spec V. Both get four-wheel disc brakes in place of the standard Sentra&#x27;s disc/drum setup, unique interior and exterior trim and 17-inch alloy wheels. Both are powered by a redesigned 2.5-liter QR25DE engine. Each model also comes standard with a sport grille, lower body side sill extensions, rear spoiler, fog lights, chrome exhaust-tip finisher, smoked headlight surround and smoked taillights. Unique interior features include black sport seat cloth with red stitching and SE-R embroidered logos, sport metallic-tone accents, aluminium pedal pads, and twin pod meters with oil pressure and G-sensor displays. Also, the 2007-2012 Sentra SER was the only Sentra in the lineup to not change its front bumper design in 2010.

A sunroof package was optional, featuring power sliding glass sunroof with tilt feature, and dual illuminated visor vanity mirrors. An Audio package, featuring a 340-watt Rockford Fosgate 6-CD audio system, with eight speakers (two subwoofers, four mid-range woofers, and two tweeters) was also available.

The SE-R base model is rated at at 6000 rpm and at 2800 rpm and comes exclusively with Nissan&#x27;s Sport-tuned Xtronic CVT continuously variable transmission and steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters. Suspension upgrades included a front-stabilizer bar (23.0mm) and sport-tuned springs. It featured 11.7&quot; vented front discs and 11.5&quot; rear discs brakes. The SE-R base model started at $19,400 (MSRP).

The SE-R Spec V is rated at at 6600 rpm and at 5200 rpm and comes with a 6-speed manual and optional limited-slip differential. It is capable of 0–60 mph times of 6.7 seconds and a 1/4 mile time of 15.1 seconds at 92.6 mph. On the track, slalom figures resulted in 64.7 mph and .86g at the skidpad. Compression is bumped up to 10.5:1, compared to 9.6:1 in the SE-R base. Front disc brakes are also increased to 12.6&quot;. Exclusive suspension upgrades include a sport-tuned suspension with lowered height, sport-tuned shocks and struts, reinforced upper cowl, trunk-mounted V-brace, and a larger front stabilizer bar (25mm). Unique interior features included red front seat belts, leather-wrapped steering wheel with red stitching, and a leather wrapped shift knob. The SE-R Spec V model started at $19,900 (MSRP). 2012 was the final model of the SE-R and Spec V performance variant.

===SL===
The sixth generation Sentra also has a better equipped variant known as the SL. These models are generally equipped with an automatic transmission, leather interior, and navigation system.

===FE+ 2.0 SR (2009)===
The car was sold for US$17,760, same as the Sentra FE+ 2.0 S model.

===Flex fuel===
Nissan launched in August 2009 in Brazil a FFV variant of the B16 Sentra. It features the same MR20DE engine, but capable of running on hydrated ethanol (E100) or a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25 percent of anhydrous ethanol (mandatory blend since 1993) or a mix of both in any proportion.

The engine received a new electronic control unit (ECU) supplied by Bosch and ethanol corrosive-action-resistant internal components. Among these new parts are the intake and exhaust valves and seals made with new materials, the first piston ring made with anodized steel, more resistant connecting rods, fuel injectors suitable for use in ethanol and double-layer exhaust gas oxygen to increase the moisture resistance of the fuel. The power rose to 141 hp (143 cv) both in gasoline and ethanol. Compression ratio of 9.7:1 was kept unchanged.

At the time it was launched, there was some controversy regarding the possibility of vehicles equipped with CVT transmission be converted to flex fuel, since this was the statement that was made by Honda Motor of Brazil in the launch of the second generation Honda Fit in Brazil. During the 2008 upgrade of the Honda Fit, the CVT system was replaced by a conventional automatic transmission and according to the manufacturer it was not possible to attach the CVT transmission infinite relations to a flex fuel engine. Honda&#x27;s decision to change the type of transmission reduced manufacturing costs and Brazilian auto press inquired the truth of that statement following the release of the CVT-equipped Sentra FFV.
== Seventh generation (B17; 2012) ==

The 2013 Nissan Sentra was revealed at the 2012 Beijing Auto Show as the Nissan Sylphy, as both the Sylphy and Sentra model development were merged into a single global model for efficiency. The design of the car is based on aerodynamic and premium design with LED-bordered headlamps, LED tail lamps, sharp angled trunk lid and chrome trim and featuring large interior space and class leading trunk. It also features an intelligent key with push start button and a dual-zone climate control in certain markets. This model was envisioned to debut in over 120 countries around the world by 2014.

=== Markets ===

==== North America ====
Nissan unveiled the seventh generation Sentra in North America in August 2012 for the 2013 model year. It is the third region to get the B17 Sylphy model after China and Thailand. The new Sentra is completely redesigned inside and out, with styling upscaled to look more similar to Nissan&#x27;s other sedans, the Altima and Maxima including LED taillights, LED accents in the headlights, and a new navigation and electronics system.

It is longer than the previous generation Sentra by 2.3in, with a 0.6in longer wheelbase, but 150 lb lighter than its predecessor.

== Other versions ==
=== New Zealand ===
In countries such as New Zealand, vehicles from both the Nissan Sunny and Nissan Pulsar ranges were marketed as a single model range (with the exception of the Pulsar, which included an EXA model identical to the North American Pulsar), the &quot;Nissan Sentra&quot;, which differed (apart from the station wagon) from the models sold under the same name in the United States.

The Sentra name was adopted in several other countries, such as New Zealand, where it was used for the Nissan Pulsar range from 1986 (although the station wagon version was actually a rebadged Nissan Sunny California). The Sentra name continued to be used in New Zealand for the Pulsar until 1998, just as Almera was used in Europe. After 2002, the Pulsar name was adopted.

Unlike the North American version, a hatchback was offered; engines offered were 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 2.0 L gasoline engines; a diesel was available in Europe. Some were sold in the Republic of Ireland.

=== Southeast Asia ===

In Southeast Asia, the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy N16 was marketed as the Nissan Sentra in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. A facelifted version was introduced specifically for this region at the end of 2005, which was offered instead of the second generation Nissan Bluebird Sylphy, also launched at the end of 2005.

In Taiwan, Yulon has built its licensed version of the Sunny as the Sentra since 1990. The Taiwanese-market Sentra reflects the styling of the Japanese-market Bluebird Sylphy (also as the Almera/Pulsar sedan but with a luxury emphasis). This N16 model is called Sentra M1. The Nissan Sentra nameplate returned in October 2013 as B17, marketed as Nissan Super Sentra.

In Indonesia, the first and second generations Sentra were the Sunny-based B12 and B13 models respectively. The 1988–1990 B12 was offered as SGX Sedan and SR Coupe. The B13 was nicknamed Sentra Genesis, only sold as sedan from 1991 to 1996. After skipping six years, Nissan re-introduced the Sentra in Indonesia in 2002. The Sentra was now based on the N16 Pulsar or Nissan Bluebird Sylphy. It is only powered by a 1.8-liter QG18 engine matched to a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Sentra was only offered in luxury &quot;Super Saloon&quot; trim level, loaded with standard ABS and leather interior. However, it was sold only in small numbers until 2004.

The Philippines also used the Sentra name for its version of the Pulsar. The N16 model was known as the Nissan Sentra Exalta (available from 2001 to 2003). The early model is similar to the JDM Bluebird Sylphy. Nissan Philippines introduced a model with new headlights and tail lights, that was later renamed back to Sentra. This model was known as the Sunny Neo in Thailand. These N16 Sentras is powered by QG series engines. In 2010, the Sentra B16 became available in the Philippines marketed as the new Nissan Sentra 200 with an MR20 engine.

<text>Moreton is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in Merseyside, England. Located on the north coast of the Wirral Peninsula, it is approximately to the west of Wallasey. Historically part of Cheshire and now within the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, the town was divided in 2004 between the local government wards of Leasowe &amp; Moreton East and Moreton West &amp; Saughall Massie. Moreton is also part of the parliamentary constituency of Wallasey.

In the 2001 census it had a population of 17,670.

==History==
Prior to the Norman conquest, the Lingham area of Moreton was a possible location for Dingesmere, mentioned with regard to the Battle of Brunanburh, in Egil&#x27;s Saga.
It was in the Wirral Hundred. In the twelfth century, it formed part of the estates of Hamo de Mascy. The name Moreton was first recorded in 1278, as Meretun, and derives from Anglo-Saxon words meaning a settlement (&quot;tun&quot;) beside a lake (&quot;mere&quot;). The village joined with neighbouring Lingham to form the parish of Moreton-cum-Lingham in the late nineteenth century. Moreton was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Bidston, in 1866 Moreton became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1928 the parish was abolished and merged with Wallasey and became part of the County Borough of Wallasey.

==Geography==
The town is located between Great Meols to the west and Bidston and Upton to the south and east. Before the sea embankment was constructed, the area included 3000 acres of tidal lagoon, at between one and two metres below sea level, with most of the remainder little more than one metre above. 

The coast at Moreton is part of a stretch of sand that runs from Meols to Leasowe known as Mockbeggar Wharf, named after Mockbeggar Hall, otherwise known as Leasowe Castle. &#x27;Mockbeggar Hall&#x27; is also the name of Moreton&#x27;s former Wetherspoons pub (The name Mockbeggar apparently being an old sailors&#x27; term for a lone house). The North Wirral Coastal Park also runs for four miles along this coast, including public open space, common land, natural foreshore and sand dunes. The park provides a wide variety of recreational activities; some of the more popular being sailing, sea angling, swimming, cycling, picnicking, walking, jogging, ball games, bird watching and horse riding.

The low-lying land behind the coast is protected by a large concrete embankment. Some of the coastal land is in the Moreton Conservation Area and provides important natural habitat. The embankment gives a good view at low tide to see a variety of wading birds. There are also good views of Bidston Hill and Caldy Hill. Further afield, Winter Hill is often visible beyond Liverpool and, in the opposite direction, much of North Wales can be seen from the embankment, including Moel Famau, Snowdonia, the Great Orme and Anglesey. On clear days, Black Combe in Cumbria can also be seen.

Arrowe Brook merges with the Birket at Moreton. The Birket then continues towards West Float at the site of the former Wallasey Pool.

==Demography==
The population was 210 in 1801, 350 in 1851, 597 in 1901 and 4029 in 1921.
At the 2001 census, the population was 12,532 (5,980 males, 6,552 females), although sharing split wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, encompassing a larger area, it was recorded as 13,735 (6,442 males, 7,293 females) for Leasowe and Moreton East, and 14,423 (6,879 males, 7,544 females) for Moreton West and Saughall Massie. At the 2011 Census, the population is solely recorded as sharing split wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, encompassing the larger area, being recorded as 14,640 (7,005 males, 7,635 females) for Leasowe and Moreton East, and 13,988 (6,732 males, 7,256 females) for Moreton West and Saughall Massie.

==Governance==
Moreton is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. Moreton is also part of the parliamentary constituency of Wallasey. The current Member of Parliament is Angela Eagle, a Labour representative who has held the seat since 1992. The previous incumbent of the post was Lynda Chalker, a Conservative MP.

The area is also split amongst two of the local government wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. These being Leasowe &amp; Moreton East and Moreton West &amp; Saughall Massie. Moreton is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by six councillors: three from the Labour Party (Moreton East) and three from the Conservative Party (Moreton West). The most recent local elections took place on 6 May 2021.

==Economy==
===Food manufacturing===
Moreton is also known for being the home of the Burton&#x27;s factory, and now owned by Duke Street Capital. This factory was also the producer of Cadbury&#x27;s biscuits. Manor Bakeries, the former Cadbury&#x27;s cakes department, (now owned by Premier Foods Group) is located in the town at Reeds Lane, near to Leasowe railway station.

Moreton is also home to Typhoo Tea, with the factory which manufactures Typhoo, being located next to the Burton&#x27;s factory.

===Pharmaceuticals===

Until the 1990s, Bristol-Myers Squibb was also a major employer to the local workforce, with a large factory located on the opposite side of Reeds Lane to Burton&#x27;s, next to Leasowe Station. However, in the mid-90s, manufacturing was moved out of Moreton which led to the closure of the factory. At the same time, there was actually heavy investment into modern drug development and research labs on the site, which are still operated by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2009, the company provided further investment into the site.

===Tarran Way Industrial Estate===
The Tarran Way Industrial Estate is mainly home to various car repair facilities, and other light industry businesses.

Dantec is the UK&#x27;s biggest manufacturer of composite hoses, which are used in the transfer of petrochemicals. The company was established in 1969, and the business is situated on Tarran Way.

===Former brickworks===
Della Robbia Pottery used local red clay from Moreton. Barker and Briscoe Brickworks was situated on Carr Lane, west of the centre of the village.

==Community==
===Schools===
Moreton Christ Church CofE Primary School, located on Upton Road, is a Church of England school that educates around 400 pupils in ages 4–11. It was opened, as the &#x27;Moreton Church of England School&#x27;in 1861, in the centre of Moreton. It was established in its current location in 1974.

Other schools include Sacred Heart Primary School, Lingham Primary School, Eastway Primary School, Sandbrook Primary School, Foxfield School (formerly St Thomas Becket Catholic School demolished around 2012/13), Orrets Meadow Special School and Clare Mount Specialist Sports College (formerly Moreton Middle School).

===Churches===

Moreton has various religious establishments, though all of Christian denominations. The most substantial building is the Church of England&#x27;s Christ Church on Upton Road, which was built in 1863 and replaced an earlier building known as a chapel-of-ease. This earlier building had been pulled down by 1690, and was then within the parish of Bidston. The church, vicarage and school were built at a cost of £8,000, paid for by a donation from William Inman, with the church being designed by Cunningham and Audsley. The church has a spire, and used to have a rectory which was demolished in 1922. Christ Church became a Grade II listed building in 1987.

The other significant churches include Sacred Heart Catholic Church and the Moreton Methodist Church. The smaller establishments include the Moreton Presbyterian Church, the Moreton Christian Assembly, the Moreton Baptist Church and a building belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

===Leisure===
Moreton Library is situated on Pasture Road, with a nearby youth club and boxing club. A dance club is further along Pasture Road, near to Moreton Shore and the lighthouse. The 4th Moreton Scout Group is situated on Upton Road.

====Public Houses====

Public houses include the &quot;Coach &amp; Horses Inn&quot; which opened in 1928, &quot;The Grange&quot;, &quot;The Mockbeggar Hall&quot;, which was a branch of JD Wetherspoon, &quot;The Farmers Arms&quot;, &quot;The Sandbrook&quot; and &quot;The Armchair&quot;. Former pubs included the &quot;Morton Arms&quot;, noted for its incorrect spelling, although it is thought to be an external source and not intended as Moreton, the &quot;Millhouse&quot; (demolished 2018) and the &quot;Plough Inn&quot; (demolished).

====Parks and Commons====
Parks include Lingham Park and Upton Park. Meanwhile, Ditton Lane Nature Reserve is towards the coast, along with the North Wirral Coastal Park. In the North Wirral Coastal Park, Leasowe Lighthouse was built in 1763 and is the oldest brick-built lighthouse in Britain. The lighthouse was built because of the sandbanks just offshore. 
It has been restored and is open to the public at times.

===Sport===
The Moreton Hills Golf Centre has a driving range which is situated adjacent to the Tarran Way Industrial Estate. Moreton Football Club was on Upton Road, and is now based at Sandbrook Lane, as Sandbrook FC.

==Transport==
===Road===
Moreton is situated at the roundabout junction of roads from Bidston (the A553), Leasowe (the A551), Meols (the A553) and Upton (the A551). The A5027 Upton bypass continues into Junction 2a of the M53 motorway, known as Moreton Spur, to the south of Moreton.

===Boat===
Moreton witnessed the world&#x27;s first commercial passenger and mail hovercraft service. A Vickers-Armstrong VA-3 hovercraft was operated by British United Airways and ran from Leasowe embankment to Rhyl in North Wales. The service commenced on 20 July 1962. However, due to varying reasons including bad weather and technical difficulties the service was cancelled after its final journey on 14 September 1962.

===Rail===
There are two stations serving Moreton, these are Moreton and Leasowe. Both stations are on the West Kirby branch of the Wirral Line and have direct electric services, operated by Merseyrail, to West Kirby and via Birkenhead. Both Leasowe and Moreton offer park and ride facilities.
A third station has been proposed to serve the Town Meadow / Millhouse areas but this is currently seen as a long term project by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

<text>Maud Foster Windmill is a seven-storey, five sail windmill located by the Maud Foster Drain in Skirbeck, Boston, Lincolnshire, from which she is named. She is one of the largest operating windmills in England being tall to the cap ball.

The tower mill and adjoining granary is grade I listed building. The mill was built in 1819 for Isaac and Thomas Reckitt of Wainfleet. It was repaired and restored in 1988.

==History==
The tower mill was erected on Willoughby Road on the east side of John Rennie&#x27;s Maud Foster Drain for Thomas and Isaac Reckitt by the Hull millwrights Norman and Smithson in 1819. Corn for the mill was brought in by barge along the drain. The original drawings and accounts survive, telling us that it cost £1826-10s-6d. The Reckitt brothers were millers, corn factors and bakers until poor harvests in the years up to 1833 led to the mill being sold. Isaac Reckitt moved to Nottingham and then to Hull where he set up Reckitt &amp; Sons.

The Ostler family bought the mill in 1914 and ran the business, known as Ostler&#x27;s Mill, until 1948 when it closed and the mill fell into disrepair. In 1953 Isaac Reckitt&#x27;s great grandson, Basil arranged for two Reckitt family charitable trusts to finance essential repairs by Thompsons of Alford and, in the same year, the mill was listed as being of exceptional interest.

In 1987 the mill was bought by James Waterfield and his family who restored her in 1988 to fully working order being now the most productive windmill in all England. The mill is open to visitors who may climb all seven floors and see the milling process in action and enjoy views of the town from the balcony. The mill shop sells flour and porridge.

==Structure==

The seven-stage mill tower is constructed in gault brick and has Yorkshire sash windows with segmental heads on each level. It is topped with an ogee cap made of white painted timber and canvas and has five sails and a fan tail. At the third floor level is a wooden cantilevered balcony on timber brackets. The mill is accessed by a pair of planked doors up three stone steps.

The three-storey granary is built in red brick and has a hipped pantile roof with dog-toothed eaves. The granary has four bays, the second bay occupied by planked taking-in doors and the other three by Yorkshire sash windows with brick segmental heads. Above the taking-in doors is a timber-planked and gabled lucam on timber brackets.

==Equipment==

The mill retains its original floor beams and mill machinery from 1819 by millwrights Norman and Smithson of Hull. The mill has three sets of grinding stones and is in working order.

The mill has five instead of the more usual four patent sails, the shutters of which are now at Wrawby post mill. An unusual feature is the weather beam (or &#x27;rode balk&#x27;) which is made of cast iron, probably replacing the original wooden one. The brake wheel is a wooden clasp-arm type with an iron tooth ring and wooden brake. The wallower is also made of iron with a wooden friction drive to the sackhoist. The dust floor is more spacious than is often found in Lincolnshire and is lit by windows.

Three pairs of grinding stones, two grey and one French, survive on the fourth floor with vats, spouts etc. all intact. The great spur wheel is made of iron, as is the upright shaft. The stone nuts have wooden cogs, as usual. The spout floor gives access to the reefing stage and contains a fine governor which controls all three pairs of stones. The bridge trees are made of iron and are Y-shaped with integral bridging boxes.

<doc id="1080909" wikidata="Q1146276" url="?curid=1080909" title="Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic">
<text>Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) is a set of standards designed to work on either a GSM core network or the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network. The framework provides tools for operators to define additional features for standard GSM services/UMTS services. The CAMEL architecture is based on the Intelligent Network (IN) standards, and uses the CAP protocol. The protocols are codified in a series of ETSI Technical Specifications.

Many services can be created using CAMEL, and it is particularly effective in allowing these services to be offered when a subscriber is roaming, like, for instance, No-prefix dialing (the number the user dials is the same no matter the country where the call is placed) or seamless MMS message access from abroad.

==CAMEL entities==
*GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF)
*GSM Service Switching Function (gsmSSF)
*GSM Specialized Resource Function (gsmSRF)
*GPRS Service Switching Function (gprsSSF)

==Specifications==
CAMEL specification were published in phases, with four phases having been established , each building on the previous. Phases 1 and 2 were defined before 3G networks existed, and as such support adding IN services to a GSM network, although they are equally applicable to 2.5G and 3G networks. Phase 3 was defined for 3GPP Releases 99 and 4, and hence is a GSM and UMTS common specification, while Phase 4 was defined as part of 3GPP Release 5.

In line with other GSM specifications, later phases should be fully backwards compatible with earlier phases; this is achieved by means of the Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) Application Context (AC) negotiation procedure, with each CAMEL phase is allocated its own AC version.

===Phase 1===
CAMEL Phase 1 defined only very basic call control services, but introduced the concept of a CAMEL Basic call state model (BCSM) to the Intelligent Network (IN). Phase 1 gave the gsmSCF the ability to bar calls (release the call prior to connection), allow a call to continue unchanged, or to modify a limited number of call parameters before allowing it to continue. The gsmSCF could also monitor the status of a call for certain events (call connection and disconnection), and take appropriate action on being informed of the event.
Phase 1 was defined as part of Release 96 in 1997.

===Phase 2===
CAMEL Phase 2 enhanced the capabilities defined in Phase 1. In addition to supporting the facilities of Phase 1, Phase 2 included the following:
* Additional event detection points
* Interaction between a user and a service using announcements, voice prompting and information collection via in-band interaction or Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) interaction
* Control of call duration and transfer of Advice of Charge Information to the mobile station; 
* The ability to inform the gsmSCF about the invocation of the supplementary services Explicit Call Transfer (ECT), Call Deflection (CD) and Multi-Party Calls (MPTY)
* The ability, for easier post-processing, of integrating charging information from a serving node in normal call records

Phase 2 was defined as part of 3GPP Releases 97 and 98, in 1998, although it is referenced in the stage 1 specification of Release 96.

===Phase 3===
The third phase of CAMEL enhanced the capabilities of phase 2. The following capabilities were added:
* Support of facilities to avoid overload
* Capabilities to support Dialed Services 
* Capabilities to handle mobility events, such as (Not-)reachability and roaming;
* Control of GPRS sessions and PDP contexts
* Control of Mobile Originated SMS through both circuit-switched and packet-switched serving network entities
* Interworking with SoLSA (Support of Localised Service Area). Support for this interworking is optional;
* The gsmSCF can be informed about the invocation of the supplementary service Call Completion to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)

Phase 3 was released as part of 3GPP Releases 99 and 4 in 1999.

===Phase 4===
The fourth phase of CAMEL built on the capabilities of phase 3. The following features were defined:
* Support for Optimal Routing of circuit-switched mobile-to-mobile calls
* The capability for the gsmSCF to create additional parties in an existing call (Call Party Handling)
* The capability for the gsmSCF to create a new call unrelated to any other existing call (Call Party Handling - new call)
* Capabilities for the enhanced handling of call party connections (Call Party Handling)
* Control of Mobile Terminated SMS through both circuit-switched and packet-switched serving network entities
* The capability for the gsmSCF to control sessions in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)
* The gsmSCF can request the gsmSSF to play a fixed or a variable sequence of tones

With CAMEL Phase 4, it is possible that only a limited subset of the new functionalities is supported, in addition to the complete support of CAMEL Phase 3.

Phase 4 was released as part of 3GPP Release 5 in 2002.

<text>Spark Unlimited, based in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, was a video game developer founded by former developers from the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; video game franchise. The studio&#x27;s first game was &quot;Call of Duty: Finest Hour&quot; in 2004. Its last game was &quot;&quot; in 2014. The company shut down in May 2015.

== History ==
Spark Unlimited was established by a team of 28 developers who had previously worked on the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series. It signed with Activision to work on a &quot;Call of Duty&quot; game in December 2003.

In 2005, Spark filed a lawsuit against Activision and accused the company of trying &quot;kill off&quot; Spark. Activision counter-sued for fraud. Spark announced a deal to develop several games for ad network Massive.

<doc id="1080924" wikidata="Q4659051" url="?curid=1080924" title="A Promise (Xiu Xiu album)">
<text>A Promise is the second studio album by American experimental band Xiu Xiu, released on February 18, 2003 by 5 Rue Christine.

== Overview ==

The track &quot;Sad Pony Guerrilla Girl&quot; is a reworking of a song by Jamie Stewart&#x27;s previous band Ten In The Swear Jar (XITSJ), called just &quot;Sad Girl&quot;, which first appeared on their 1999 album &quot;My Very Private Map&quot;. &quot;Pink City&quot; also has its roots in a two-part song from XITSJ&#x27;s unreleased album &quot;Eat Death Orphans!&quot;, which was eventually published in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Accordion Solo!&quot; as &quot;Hot Karl&quot;.

The album includes a stripped-down cover of Tracy Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Fast Car&quot;, of which Stewart said &quot;That song really, very, very, very directly shaped how I wanted to write lyrics or what I wanted songs to be about...I wanted them to turn out in so far as the song very specifically narrates some particular horrible things that happen to somebody and there&#x27;s no positive resolution in the end at all.&quot;

Referring to the closing track, &quot;Ian Curtis Wishlist&quot;, Stewart explained that &quot;an Ian Curtis wish list is a list of things that you have convinced yourself that you want to have happen, but you know that are never going to happen.&quot;

== Cover art ==

The cover art shows &quot;a nude man kneeling on a bed and holding an upside-down baby doll&quot;. The photograph was taken by Xiu Xiu frontperson Jamie Stewart, who met the photo&#x27;s subject, a prostitute, at a gay cruising spot in Hanoi, Vietnam, and paid the man to take photos with the baby. The original release was printed with an orange rectangle covering the man&#x27;s penis, as the distributor told the band that only a tenth of the stores would carry the album without the censor. The rectangle censor was based on Todd Solondz&#x27;s &quot;Storytelling&quot;, and Stewart was fine with it since &quot;the point of the photo was him and not his dick&quot;. The vinyl reissue went uncensored, and the label (Absolutely Kosher) threatened to take their business elsewhere if the manufacturer did not want to print the cover.

== Reception ==

Brandon Stosuy of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that Stewart &quot;came into [their] own&quot; on &quot;A Promise&quot;.

<text>Luke Samuel Johnson (November 3, 1807 – December 9, 1861) was a leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from 1835 to 1838. He served in the Quorum with his younger brother, Lyman E. Johnson, and Orson Hyde, his brother-in-law.

Johnson was born November 3, 1807, in Pomfret, Vermont, a son of John Johnson and Elsa Jacobs. He wrote of his family in an autobiographical sketch:

Johnson was an educator and a physician. He married Susan H. Poteet on November 1, 1833. This marriage produced six children: Elisa Mary, Fanny, Eliza, Vashtia, James, and Solomon. After Susan&#x27;s death on September 20, 1846, he married America Morgan Clark on March 3, 1847, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and had additional children. This family included Susan Marinda, Orson Albert, Mark Anthony, Charlotte Elizabeth, Lovinia Ann, Phebe W. and Luke.

==Church membership and service==

Johnson was baptized into the Church of Christ on May 10, 1831, by Joseph Smith. By October 1831, he had been ordained an elder and went on a mission to southern Ohio with Robert Rathburn. Later in 1831, he joined Sidney Rigdon in preaching the gospel in areas of Pennsylvania and Ohio. Their efforts brought about fifty new members into the young church, including Rigdon&#x27;s mother and other members of the Rigdon family. At one point, while he was praying, he had a vision of both the Angel Moroni and the golden plates.

Johnson was ordained to the office of high priest by Smith on October 25, 1831. With Seymour Brunson and Hazen Aldrich, he served as a missionary in Ohio, Virginia, and Kentucky in 1832 and 1833, baptizing more than a hundred people on their journey. He was a member of the Kirtland high council which was formed on February 17, 1834. On June 26, 1834, Johnson marched with Zion&#x27;s Camp, suffering with cholera on the journey. At age 27, Johnson was chosen and ordained one of the original members of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles on February 15, 1835. Shortly after the quorum was formed, the new apostles were sent on missions. Johnson served in the Eastern United States, New York and Upper Canada. He returned to Kirtland, Ohio, in late 1836. There, he attended Hebrew school and the Kirtland Temple.

Johnson defended Smith from criticism on several occasions. But, in 1837, he became alienated from Smith, in part because of financial losses suffered in the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society. He was disfellowshipped at Kirtland on September 3, 1837. Johnson was later received back into fellowship for a short time, but in December 1837, he denounced Smith and resigned from the church. After leaving the church, Johnson moved to Cabell County, Virginia, where he taught at Marshall Academy and then studied medicine, ultimately setting up a medical practice in Kirtland. The church excommunicated Johnson in 1838 on charges of apostasy.

In 1846, after the death of Smith, Johnson requested permission to address an assembly of the saints in Nauvoo, Illinois. He said: &quot;I have stopped by the wayside and stood aloof from the work of the Lord ... But my heart is with this people. I want to be associated with the saints, go with them into the wilderness and continue with them to the end.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s brother-in-law, Orson Hyde, rebaptized him into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on March 8, 1846. However, he never again served in the higher councils of the church.

Johnson traveled with Brigham Young and Wilford Woodruff to the Salt Lake Valley, serving as a captain of ten, as part of the first group of 143 Mormon pioneers in July 1847. He also served as a Captain of Fifty in the Daniel A. Miller/John W. Cooley Company (1853), while traveling with members of his family. Johnson settled in St. John, Tooele County, Utah, where he served as bishop of a local LDS congregation. He is the only man in the church&#x27;s history who served as a bishop after being a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He died December 9, 1861, in the home of Orson Hyde in Salt Lake City and was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

<text>Sir Terence Hedley Matthews (born 6 June 1943) is a Welsh-Canadian business magnate, serial high-tech entrepreneur, and Wales&#x27; first billionaire. He was the richest man in Wales until 2012, when he was surpassed by Sir Michael Moritz.

He has founded or funded over 100 companies in the high-tech communications field, most notably Mitel and Newbridge Networks. He is the chairman of Wesley Clover and the Swansea Bay City Region board. He owns the Celtic Manor Resort, KRP Properties, the Brookstreet Hotel, and the Marshes Golf Club.

==Early life==
Matthews was born in Newport, South Wales, at the then Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital. Matthews returned as an adult to include the manor house that housed the hospital within the Celtic Manor Resort. He grew up in the town of Newbridge, Caerphilly. He studied at Swansea University and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Electronics in 1969.

==Career==
After an apprenticeship at British Telecom&#x27;s research lab at Martlesham Heath, Matthews left Britain and joined MicroSystems International, a chipmaking operation affiliated with Northern Telecom (which became Nortel Networks) in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

===Mitel===
Matthews&#x27; first enterprise was started in collaboration with fellow Briton and Microsystems employee Michael Cowpland in 1972. To raise seed money for future enterprises they had planned, the pair intended to import and sell electric lawnmowers built in the UK. Conventionally, and from accounts by Matthews, the name Mitel is thought to be a contraction of &quot;Mike and Terry Lawnmowers&quot;. However, Cowpland is quoted as saying that it stands for &quot;Mike and Terry ELectronics&quot;. This first endeavour was a fiasco; the shipping company carrying the first batch lost the container. When the lawnmowers finally arrived, the ground was covered with snow in the Canadian winter and no one would buy them. Matthews later said &quot;That taught me a key lesson – the importance of timing. The shipping company lost the lawnmowers! By the time they showed up no-one wanted them, as you can&#x27;t cut grass when it&#x27;s covered with snow.&quot;

Mitel became a technology consultancy company run from home to the various companies around Ottawa&#x27;s emerging high-tech district. Mitel&#x27;s clients included the National Research Council, the Communications Research Centre, and a handful of pioneering start-ups including SHL Systemhouse, which was later purchased by EDS and now is part of HP and Quasar Systems (now Cognos).

Obtaining funding from a $4,000 bank loan, as well as from their own savings and a group of angel investors (notably Kent Plumley), the two developed a telephony DTMF tone receiver based on Cowpland&#x27;s PhD thesis. This was a major advance in the technology, since they were able to sell receivers at a fraction of the cost of competing versions, while gaining returns of 1000%. Additionally, Mitel later became a chip manufacturer with the acquisition of the Silek foundry in Bromont, Quebec.

Later, the pair realized that the then-new technology of microprocessors and other semiconductor devices would make a similar change in the market for small PBXs. The SX200 PBX launched to immense success, being cheaper to purchase, quicker to install and far more functional. Mitel became one of the more successful manufacturers of small PBX systems and telecom semiconductors in the world, floating on the New York Stock Exchange in 1981.

In 1985, British Telecom bought a controlling interest in Mitel. Cowpland would later form the company that became Corel, and Matthews later founded Newbridge Networks.

===Newbridge Networks===

In 1986, Matthews drove Newbridge to become a leader in the worldwide data networking industry, manufacturing data communications products, especially ATM devices and routers. In 2000 the company employed more than 6,500 employees with recorded FY 1999 revenue of $1.8 billion. Later in 2000, Newbridge was acquired by Alcatel for $7.1 billion. Matthews&#x27; personal stake in Newbridge was valued at over a billion dollars, and as a result of the transaction he became the largest single shareholder in Alcatel.

===Return to Mitel===
In 2000, he reacquired the Mitel PBX business and company name, taking it private. He has invested heavily ($600 million by 2006) in Mitel to turn it into a broadband communications company. The company has made significant investments in enterprise Voice over IP telephony technology. Mitel&#x27;s manufacturing business was spun off as BreconRidge. The company acquired Intertel in April 2007. Mitel went public again in 2010. Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies in November 2013. Mitel announced the purchase of Mavenir Systems in March 2015. Mitel announced the purchase of Polycom in April 2016, however, the deal fell through and Polycom instead merged with private equity firm Siris Capital Group. In July 2017, Mitel announced they had reached a deal to buy ShoreTel for $430 million, increasing the size of the company to 4,200 employees. On 24 April 2018, the company announced it would be bought by an investor group led by Searchlight Capital Partners.

==Wales==
Matthews spends a considerable amount of time in his native Wales, working on such ventures as the Celtic Manor Resort, a leisure complex in Newport, near the south Wales coast, chosen to host the 2010 Ryder Cup golf tournament and the 2014 NATO summit. The Celtic Manor hosted the ISPS Handa Wales Open for 15 years. The original Celtic Manor Hotel was formerly a maternity hospital and is Matthews&#x27; birthplace.

Matthews bought Celtic Manor in 1980, ploughing £100m into the project. Firstly the 19th century Manor House was renovated, while in 1991 plans were unveiled to develop two new golf courses and a convention centre between the manor and the River Usk. Matthews had become friends with golf course architect, the late Robert Trent Jones Snr, whose family roots were in Aberystwyth. Work began on the &#x27;Roman Road&#x27; course in 1992, named after the main route connecting the former Roman fortress of Caerleon with the town of Caerwent, which crosses the land. In 1994 the 4,000-yard &#x27;Coldra Woods&#x27; golf course was started, as well as the £10m golf clubhouse hotel.

Celtic Manor was Hotel of the Year in 2002, and won two European Design Awards in 2001 - one for the interior designers, Goff Associates, and one for its spa from the International Spa Association. Matthews commented that: &quot;I think the resort can act as a magnet to draw new investment into Wales from across the UK and overseas. I did my best to put up a building that you can see from the West End of London and I didn&#x27;t come far short of it!&quot;.

In September 2014, Matthews was appointed chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region Board. The Swansea Bay City Region Board is backing a Swansea Tidal Lagoon project.

In January 2016, he purchased the Hilton Hotel in Newport, which has since undergone significant renovation, and has been incorporated into the Celtic Manor Resort Collection as the Coldra Court Hotel.

==Philanthropy==
Matthews founded the Wesley Clover Foundation, a not-for-profit, philanthropic corporation that supports entrepreneurship, healthcare, education, and community initiatives. The foundation leased the properties formerly known as the Nepean National Equestrian Park and the Ottawa Municipal Campground to create Wesley Clover Parks. Matthews hosts an annual gala, Lumière, that has raised over $1 million for charity.

==Honours==
Matthews was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1994 Birthday Honours for services to the communications industry.

In 1998, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng).

On 16 June 2001, he was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2001 Birthday Honours for services to Industry and to Wales. 

Matthews has received honorary doctorates from the University of Wales (Glamorgan and Swansea), Carleton University. and the University of Bath in 2006.

In 2011, he was appointed patron of the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute at Cardiff University.

It was released on 28 August 2000 in the United Kingdom by Chrysalis Records and in the United States by Capitol Records. Following the critical and commercial success of &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot; (1998), the North American release of &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot; (1999) and the subsequent promotional tours for both albums, Williams reteamed with producers Guy Chambers and Steve Power to create new material for his next record. Whereas &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot; used the Britpop genre for its overall sound, &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; incorporates a more post-millennial dance-pop approach while utilizing classic British rock elements.

The album garnered positive reviews from critics. &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; debuted at number one in the UK, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand, as well as the top 10 in countries like Australia, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. It spawned six singles: &quot;Rock DJ&quot;, &quot;Kids&quot; (with Kylie Minogue), &quot;Supreme&quot;, &quot;Let Love Be Your Energy&quot;, &quot;Eternity&quot;/&quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; and &quot;Better Man&quot;.

==Background and content==
Following the 1998 release of his album &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Expecting You&quot;, and in the middle of promotion and touring in 1999, Williams found time to start the work on what would be his third studio album.

The sound of the album was described as seeing Williams move &quot;farther away from the increasingly dated visions of Oasis-style Britpop to embrace post-millennial dance-pop, complete with the bruising beats and extroverted productions to match.&quot; The album features a variety of styles, &quot;conjuring a panoply of classic British rock touchstones like psychedelia, slick country rock, Ian Dury, the Who, Elton John, and Madchester.&quot;

The album&#x27;s title is a reference to a popular football chant of the same name that goes to the tune of &quot;Guantanamera&quot;, Williams being a fan of Port Vale. The cover art features multiple images of Williams celebrating winning a trophy at Chelsea&#x27;s stadium Stamford Bridge.

Initial releases do not feature Williams&#x27; name or the album title on the front cover, nor is there a track listing featured on the back cover; these were all changed for future releases. The images were taken by photographer Paul M. Smith and, along with Williams&#x27; complete football strip, were later sold at auction to raise money for his charity &quot;Give It Sum&quot;. Williams toured the United Kingdom with Kylie Minogue in October and November 2000 to promote the album, selling out in every venue.

The album contains a hidden message put on the album for humorous intent. After 24 minutes of silence following track 12, &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; (4:08 - 28:08), a spoken message from Williams saying &quot;No, I&#x27;m not doing one on this album&quot; is heard, which means that no hidden track on the album. This is a reference to how Williams&#x27; past three albums (including the compilation album &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot;) each contain hidden tracks at the end of the album.

==Commercial reception==
When the album was released on 28 August 2000, it immediately became a hit in the United Kingdom, debuting at number-one and being certified 2× Platinum in the first week of release. The album also topped the charts in New Zealand, Ireland and Germany, and secured top ten placings in Argentina, Austria, Australia, Finland, Mexico, Sweden, Switzerland. &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; failed to reach the top 20 in Spain, reaching number 22. The album spent 91 weeks on the UK chart, going on to sell 2.4 million copies in the UK alone, being certified 8× Platinum by the BPI. The album became the best-selling album of 2000 in the UK, and the 51st-best-selling album in UK music history. The album found little success in the United States, however, peaking at 110 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Critical reception==
Initial critical response to &quot;Sing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; was positive. From Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on 11 reviews.

==Singles==
* &quot;Rock DJ&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single. The song was inspired by Williams&#x27; UNICEF mentor, the late Ian Dury. The video was censored by &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for its gore content, with many other channels following suit. Controversy ensued in the United Kingdom and many other countries, with the video showing Williams tearing chunks of skin and muscle from his body while performing a strip show, in an attempt to get noticed by a group of women. The track became an instant hit around the globe, hitting number one in the United Kingdom, becoming his third number-one single as a solo artist and exactly a year after his sell-out concert at Slane Castle. The song also reached number-one in Ireland, New Zealand, Mexico and Argentina and hit top-ten placings across Europe, Australasia and Latin America. Despite its worldwide success the song failed to break into the United States charts, although it did get some TV airplay on MTV and VH1. The song went on to win several awards including &quot;Best Song of 2000&quot; at the MTV Europe Music Awards, &quot;Best Single of the Year&quot; at the Brit Awards and an MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects. It went on to sell over 600,000 copies in the UK alone, and was certified Platinum by the BPI.
* &quot;Kids&quot;, a collaboration with Australian pop icon Kylie Minogue, was released as the album&#x27;s second single. The track was written when Minogue approached Williams to write some songs for her debut Parlophone album &quot;Light Years&quot;. Williams decided to include the track on his album and released it as a single, becoming an instant hit upon release in October of that year. The song hit number two in the United Kingdom and snared top 10 placings in Australia, New Zealand, Latvia, Mexico and several other countries. One of the biggest hits of 2000, &quot;Kids&quot; sold over 200,000 copies in the UK alone and was certified Silver.
* &quot;Supreme&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single, and was promoted in various countries by several international-language versions, including versions of the song in French and Spanish.
* &quot;Let Love Be Your Energy&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single, and was the first Robbie Williams music video not to feature Williams himself. Instead, the video was animated and featured Williams attempting to outrun a volcano.
* &quot;Eternity&quot;, a track that was not featured on the album, was released in the summer of 2001 backed with &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot;, a song which appears as the final track from the album. &quot;Eternity&quot; was written by Williams in what he called &quot;the most amazing summer ever&quot;. After years of non-stop work he took a month off and recorded this track, which became his fourth number-one single in the United Kingdom, selling over 70,000 copies in its first week. It also became a top ten hit all over Europe.
* &quot;Better Man&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s sixth and final single, exclusively in Australia and New Zealand. The single was released to relative success there.

<text>The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles is a children&#x27;s novel written by Julie Edwards, the married name of singer and actress Dame Julie Andrews. More recent editions credit the book to &quot;Julie Andrews Edwards&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Three siblings, Ben, Tom, and Melinda Potter (better known as Lindy), meet Professor Savant while visiting the zoo one rainy day. On Halloween, Lindy gets dared by her brother to knock on the spookiest house on the block for a quarter, which happens to belong to the Professor, and the three become more acquainted with him. After a second meeting, they begin spending time at the Professor&#x27;s house, where he introduces them to games of concentration and observation. He reveals that there is a magic land called Whangdoodleland which can only be reached through the imagination, and he is training them to accompany him there.

Whangdoodleland is the home of the last Whangdoodle that lived in the world. Once the Whangdoodle, and other creatures that are now considered imaginary, lived in our world. However, fearing that people were losing their imaginations in the pursuit of power and greed, the Whangdoodle created a magic and peaceful world over which he reigns. The professor and the children explore this world.

Each time the children return, they venture further and further into Whangdoodleland, intending to reach the palace where the Last Whangdoodle resides. However, the Whangdoodle&#x27;s Prime Minister, the &quot;Oily Prock&quot;, does not want them to disturb His Highness, and sets up some traps, both in Whangdoodleland and the real world to prevent this meeting. He enlists the marvelous and funny creatures of the land in his effort, including the High Behind Splintercat, the Sidewinders, the Oinck, the Gazooks, the Tree Squeaks, and the Swamp Gaboons. The children use their imaginations, intelligence, and the friendship of another denizen, the Whiffle Bird, to outwit the traps.

The kids finally meet the last Whangdoodle. It turns out he wants a female Whangdoodle to be his queen, so he won&#x27;t be lonely, and Professor Savant&#x27;s knowledge and talents have the ability to grant this to the Whangdoodle. That is, if the Professor can figure out exactly how to do it.

==Reception==
At the time of the book&#x27;s publication, Judith Viorst said of the book in the New York Times, &quot;Unfortunately, Julie (Andrews) Edwards is more committed to improving her young readers than she is to entertaining them, and her book is sunk by an overload of virtue.&quot;

Author Aimee Bender cites the book as one that sticks with her most from childhood.

==Technical specifications==
Two main models are available as well as one variant.

=== Hunting ===
This model is available with a variety of barrel and sight configurations, most intended for hunting and/or trap/skeet shooting. It is made in both Matte and camouflage finishes. Barrels may be rifled or smoothbore, and are usually 24&quot;, 26&quot;, or 28&quot; long. This model is available in 12 gauge or 20 gauge. Five types of chokes are available.

This barrel is smoothbore, and not tapped for chokes, reducing its versatility and rendering it less accurate at longer ranges. A slightly different model labeled the is similar, with the exception of an electroless nickel finish replacing the standard black coating. This model is 12 gauge only.

<doc id="1080984" wikidata="Q1550553" url="?curid=1080984" title="Query by humming">
<text>Query by humming (QbH) is a music retrieval system that branches off the original classification systems of title, artist, composer, and genre. It normally applies to songs or other music with a distinct single theme or melody. The system involves taking a user-hummed or whistled melody (input query) and comparing it to an existing database. The system then returns a ranked list of music closest to the input query. 

One example of this would be a system involving a portable media player with a built-in microphone that allows for faster searching through media files.

The MPEG-7 standard includes provisions for QbH music searches.

Examples of QbH systems include ACRCloud, SoundHound, Musipedia, Tunebot and Google Search.

<text>The Palazzo Pitti (), in English sometimes called the Pitti Palace, is a vast, mainly Renaissance, palace in Florence, Italy. It is situated on the south side of the River Arno, a short distance from the Ponte Vecchio. The core of the present palazzo dates from 1458 and was originally the town residence of Luca Pitti, an ambitious Florentine banker.

The palace was bought by the Medici family in 1549 and became the chief residence of the ruling families of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It grew as a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings, plates, jewelry and luxurious possessions. The Medici added the Boboli Gardens to the palace estate.

In the late 18th century, the palazzo was used as a power base by Napoleon and later served for a brief period as the principal royal palace of the newly united Italy. The palace and its contents were donated to the Italian people by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1919.

The palazzo is now the largest museum complex in Florence. The principal palazzo block, often in a building of this design known as the corps de logis, is 32,000 square metres. It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below.

==History==

===Early history===


The construction of this severe and forbidding building was commissioned in 1458 by the Florentine banker Luca Pitti (1398–1472), a principal supporter and friend of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. The early history of the Palazzo Pitti is a mixture of fact and myth. Pitti is alleged to have instructed that the windows be larger than the entrance of the Palazzo Medici. The 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari proposed that Brunelleschi was the palazzo&#x27;s architect, and that his pupil Luca Fancelli was merely his assistant in the task, but today it is Fancelli who is generally credited. Besides obvious differences from the elder architect&#x27;s style, Brunelleschi died 12 years before construction of the palazzo began. The design and fenestration suggest that the unknown architect was more experienced in utilitarian domestic architecture than in the humanist rules defined by Alberti in his book &quot;De Re Aedificatoria&quot;.

Though impressive, the original palazzo would have been no rival to the Florentine Medici residences in terms of either size or content. Whoever the architect of the Palazzo Pitti was, he was moving against the contemporary flow of fashion. The rusticated stonework gives the palazzo a severe and powerful atmosphere, reinforced by the three-times-repeated series of seven arch-headed apertures, reminiscent of a Roman aqueduct. The Roman-style architecture appealed to the Florentine love of the new style &quot;all&#x27;antica&quot;. This original design has withstood the test of time: the repetitive formula of the façade was continued during the subsequent additions to the palazzo, and its influence can be seen in numerous 16th-century imitations and 19th-century revivals. Work stopped after Pitti suffered financial losses following the death of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici in 1464. Luca Pitti died in 1472 with the building unfinished.

===The Medici===

The building was sold in 1549 to Eleonora di Toledo. Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke. On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear. Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo&#x27;s old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis&#x27; principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora&#x27;s son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis&#x27; art collection. 

Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the &quot;corps de logis&quot; of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was &quot;Andria&quot; by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.

===The &quot;cortile&quot; and extensions===
With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian &quot;palais&quot; of Marie de&#x27; Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the &quot;finestre inginocchiate&quot; (&quot;kneeling&quot; windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a &quot;prie-dieu&quot;, a device of Michelangelo&#x27;s), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement. On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the &quot;grotto of Moses&quot; on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the &quot;piano nobile&quot; windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the &quot;Fontana del Carciofo&quot; (&quot;Fountain of the Artichoke&quot;), designed by Giambologna&#x27;s former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.

In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi. During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the &quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot; that was copied in France. Sporadic lesser additions and alterations were made for many years thereafter under other rulers and architects.

To one side of the gardens is the bizarre grotto designed by Bernardo Buontalenti. The lower façade was begun by Vasari but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by &quot;dripping&quot; pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo&#x27;s four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna&#x27;s Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully over her shoulder at the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge.

=== Houses of Lorraine and Savoy ===
The palazzo remained the principal Medici residence until Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, the last of the male Medici line, died in 1737. It was then occupied briefly by his sister, the elderly Electress Palatine; on her death, the Medici dynasty became extinct and the palazzo passed to the new Grand Dukes of Tuscany, the Austrian House of Habsburg-Lorraine, in the person of Francis III. The Austrian tenancy was briefly interrupted by Napoleon, who used the palazzo during his period of control over Italy.

When Tuscany passed from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine to the House of Savoy in 1860, the Palazzo Pitti was included. After the Risorgimento, when Florence was briefly the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II resided in the palazzo until 1871. His grandson, Victor Emmanuel III, presented the palazzo to the nation in 1919. The palazzo and other buildings in the Boboli Gardens were then divided into five separate art galleries and a museum, housing not only many of its original contents, but priceless artefacts from many other collections acquired by the state. The 140 rooms open to the public are part of an interior, which is in large part a later product than the original portion of the structure, mostly created in two phases, one in the 17th century and the other in the early 18th century. Some earlier interiors remain, and there are still later additions such as the Throne Room. In 2005 the surprise discovery of forgotten 18th-century bathrooms in the palazzo revealed remarkable examples of contemporary plumbing very similar in style to the bathrooms of the 21st century.

==Palatine Gallery==
The Palatine Gallery, the main gallery of Palazzo Pitti, contains a large ensemble of over 500 principally Renaissance paintings, which were once part of the Medicis&#x27; and their successors&#x27; private art collection. The gallery, which overflows into the royal apartments, contains works by Raphael, Titian, Perugino (&quot;Lamentation over the Dead Christ&quot;), Correggio, Peter Paul Rubens, and Pietro da Cortona. The character of the gallery is still that of a private collection, and the works of art are displayed and hung much as they would have been in the grand rooms for which they were intended rather than following a chronological sequence, or arranged according to school of art.

The finest rooms were decorated by Pietro da Cortona in the high baroque style. Initially Cortona frescoed a small room on the &quot;piano nobile&quot; called the Sala della Stufa with a series depicting the Four Ages of Man which were very well received; the &quot;Age of Gold&quot; and &quot;Age of Silver&quot; were painted in 1637, followed in 1641 by the &quot;Age of Bronze&quot; and &quot;Age of Iron&quot;. They are regarded among his masterpieces. The artist was subsequently asked to fresco the grand ducal reception rooms; a suite of five rooms at the front of the palazzo. In these five Planetary Rooms, the hierarchical sequence of the deities is based on Ptolomeic cosmology; Venus, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter (the Medici Throne room) and Saturn, but minus Mercury and the Moon which should have come before Venus. These highly ornate ceilings with frescoes and elaborate stucco work essentially celebrate the Medici lineage and the bestowal of virtuous leadership. Cortona left Florence in 1647, and his pupil and collaborator, Ciro Ferri, completed the cycle by the 1660s. They were to inspire the later Planet Rooms at Louis XIV&#x27;s Palace of Versailles, designed by Charles Le Brun.

The collection was first opened to the public in the late 18th century, albeit rather reluctantly, by Grand Duke Leopold I, Tuscany&#x27;s first enlightened ruler, keen to obtain popularity after the demise of the Medici.

===Rooms of Palatine Gallery===

The Palatine Gallery has 28 rooms, among them:
*Room of Castagnoli: named after the painter of the ceiling frescoes. In this room are exposed Portraits of the Medici and Lorraine ruling families, and the &quot;Table of the Muses&quot;, a masterwork of stone-inlaid table realized by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure between 1837 and 1851.
*Room of the Ark: contains a painting by Giovan Battista Caracciolo (17th century). In 1816, the ceiling was frescoed by Luigi Ademollo with &quot;Transportation of the Ark of the Covenant Containing the Tablets of the Law&quot;.
*Room of Psyche: was named after ceiling frescoes by Giuseppe Collignon; it contains paintings by Salvator Rosa from 1640–1650.
*Hall of Poccetti: The frescoes on the vault were once ascribed to Bernardino Poccetti, but now attributed to Matteo Rosselli. In the center of the hall is a table (1716) commissioned by Cosimo III. In the hall are also some works by Rubens and Pontormo.
*Room of Prometheus: was named after the subject of the frescoes by Collignon (19th century) and contains a large collection of round-shaped paintings: among them is the &quot;Madonna with the Child&quot; by Filippino Lippi (15th century), two portraits by Botticelli and paintings by Pontormo and Domenico Beccafumi.
*Room of Justice: has a ceiling frescoed by Antonio Fedi (1771–1843), and displays portraits (16th century) by Titian, Tintoretto and Paolo Veronese.
*Room of Ulysses: was frescoed in 1815 by Gaspare Martellini, it contains early works by Filippino Lippi and Raphael.
*Room of Iliad: contains the &quot;Madonna of the Family Panciatichi&quot; and the &quot;Madonna Passerini&quot; (–1523 and 1526 respectively) by Andrea del Sarto, and paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi (17th century).
*Room of Saturn: contains a &quot;Portrait of Agnolo Doni&quot; (1506), the &quot;Madonna of the chair&quot; (1516), and &quot;Portrait of Cardinal Inghirami&quot; (1516) by Raphael; it also contains an &quot;Annunciation&quot; (1528) by Andrea del Sarto, and &quot;Jesus and the Evangelists&quot; (1516) by Fra Bartolomeo.
*Room of Jupiter: contains the &quot;Veiled Lady&quot;, the famous portrait by Raphael (1516) that, according to Vasari, represents the woman loved by the artist. Among the other works in the room, Paintings by Rubens, Andrea del Sarto and Perugino
*Room of Mars: is characterized by works by Rubens: the allegories representing the &quot;Consequences of War&quot; (hence the name of the room) and the &quot;Four Philosophers&quot; (among them Rubens portrayed himself, on the left). On the vault is a fresco by Pietro da Cortona, &quot;Triumph of the Medici&quot;.
*Room of Apollo: contains a &quot;Madonna with Saints&quot; (1522) by Il Rosso, originally from the Church of Santo Spirito, and two paintings by Titian: a &quot;Magdalen&quot; and &quot;Portrait of an English Nobleman&quot; (between 1530 and 1540).
*Room of Venus: contains the &quot;Venus Italica&quot; (1810) by Canova commissioned by Napoleon. On the walls are landscapes (1640–1650) by Salvator Rosa and four paintings by Titian, 1510–1545. Among the Titian paintings is a &quot;Portrait of Pope Julius II&quot; (1545) and &quot;La Bella&quot; (1535).
*White Hall: once the ball room of the palace, is characterized by the white decorations and is often used for temporary exhibitions.

The Royal Apartments include 14 rooms. Their decoration was changed to Empire style by the Savoy monarchs, but there are still some rooms maintaining decorations and furniture from the age of the Medici.

The Green Room, was frescoed by Castagnoli in early 19th Century. It exhibits an intarsia cabinet from the 17th century and a collection of gilded bronzes; the throne room was decorated for King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and is characterized by the red brocade on the walls and by the Japanese and Chinese vases (17th–18th century).

The Blue Room contains collected furniture (17th–18th century) and the portraits of members of the Medici family painted by Sustermans (1597–1681).

===Principal works of art===

==Other galleries==
===Royal Apartments===
This is a suite of 14 rooms, formerly used by the Medici family, and lived in by their successors. These rooms have been largely altered since the era of the Medici, most recently in the 19th century. They contain a collection of Medici portraits, many of them by the artist Giusto Sustermans. In contrast to the great salons containing the Palatine collection, some of these rooms are much smaller and more intimate, and, while still grand and gilded, are more suited to day-to-day living requirements. Period furnishings include four-poster beds and other necessary furnishings not found elsewhere in the palazzo. The Kings of Italy last used the Palazzo Pitti in the 1920s. By that time it had already been converted to a museum, but a suite of rooms in the Meridian wing (now the Gallery of Modern Art) was reserved for them when visiting Florence officially.

===Gallery of Modern Art===
This gallery originates from the remodeling of the Florentine academy in 1748, when a gallery of Modern Art was established. The gallery was intended to hold those art works which were prize-winners in the academy&#x27;s competitions. The Palazzo Pitti was being redecorated on a grand scale at this time and the new works of art were being collected to adorn the newly decorated salons. By the mid-19th century so numerous were the grand ducal paintings of modern art that many were transferred to the , which became the first home of the newly formed &quot;Modern Art Museum&quot;.

Following the Risorgimento and the expulsion of the grand ducal family from the palazzo, all the grand ducal modern art works were brought together under one roof in the newly titled &quot;Modern gallery of the Academy&quot;. The collection continued to expand, particularly so under the patronage of Victor Emmanuel II. However it was not until 1922 that this gallery was moved to the Palazzo Pitti where it was complemented by further modern works of art in the ownership of both the state and the municipality of Florence. The collection was housed in apartments recently vacated by members of the Italian royal family. The gallery was first opened to public viewing in 1928.

Today, further enlarged and spread over 30 rooms, this large collection includes works by artists of the Macchiaioli movement and other modern Italian schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The pictures by the Macchiaioli artists are of particular note, as this school of 19th-century Tuscan painters led by Giovanni Fattori were early pioneers and the founders of the impressionist movement. The title &quot;gallery of modern art&quot; to some may sound incorrect, as the art in the gallery covers the period from the 18th to the early 20th century. No examples of later art are included in the collection since in Italy, &quot;modern art&quot; refers to the period before World War II; what has followed is generally known as &quot;contemporary art&quot; (&quot;arte contemporanea&quot;). In Tuscany this art can be found at the Centro per l&#x27;arte contemporanea Luigi Pecci at Prato, a city about from Florence.

===Treasury of the Grand Dukes===
The Treasury of the Grand Dukes (Tesoro dei Granduchi), formerly called the Silver Museum (Museo degli Argenti), contains a collection of priceless silverware, ivory objects, jewelry, cameos, and works in semi-precious gemstones, many of the latter from the collection of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, including his collection of ancient vases, many with delicate silver gilt mounts added for display purposes in the 15th century. A room displays &quot;curiosities&quot; from the world collected by the Medicis, including a rare Precolumbian jade mask and two atlatl donated to pope Leo X. These rooms, formerly part of the private royal apartments, are decorated with 17th-century frescoes, the most splendid being by Giovanni da San Giovanni, from 1635 to 1636. The Treasury also contains a fine collection of German gold and silver artefacts purchased by Grand Duke Ferdinand III after his return from exile in 1815, following the French occupation.

===Porcelain Museum===

First opened in 1973, this museum is housed in the Casino del Cavaliere in the Boboli Gardens. The porcelain is from many of the most notable European porcelain factories, with Sèvres porcelain and Meissen porcelain being well represented. Many items in the collection were gifts to the Florentine rulers from other European sovereigns, while other works were specially commissioned by the grand ducal court. Of particular note are several large dinner services by the Vincennes factory, later renamed Sèvres, and a collection of small biscuit figurines.

===Costume Gallery===
Situated in a wing known as the &quot;&quot;, this gallery contains a collection of drresses and theatrical costumes dating from the 16th century until the present. It is also the only museum in Italy detailing the history of Italian fashions. One of the newer collections to the palazzo, it was founded in 1983 by Kirsten Aschengreen Piacenti; a suite of fourteen rooms, the Meridiana apartments, were completed in 1858.

In addition to theatrical costumes, the gallery displays garments worn between the 18th century and the present day. Some of the exhibits are unique to the Palazzo Pitti; these include the 16th-century funeral clothes of Grand Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, and his wife Eleonora of Toledo and their son Garzia, both of whom died of malaria. Their bodies would have been displayed in state wearing their finest clothes, before being reclad in plainer attire before interment. The gallery also exhibits a collection of mid-20th century costume jewellery. The &quot;Sala Meridiana&quot; originally sponsored a functional solar meridian instrument, built into the fresco decoration by Anton Domenico Gabbiani.

===Carriages Museum===
This ground floor museum exhibits half-a dozen of carriages and other conveyances used by the Grand Ducal court mainly in the late 18th and 19th century. The extent of the exhibition prompted one visitor in the 19th century to wonder, &quot;In the name of all that is extraordinary, how can they find room for all these carriages and horses&quot;. Some of the carriages are highly decorative, being adorned not only by gilt but by painted landscapes on their panels. Those used on the grandest occasions, such as the &quot;Carrozza d&#x27;Oro&quot; (golden carriage), are surmounted by gilt crowns which would have indicated the rank and station of the carriage&#x27;s occupants. Other carriages on view are those used by the King of the Two Sicilies, and Archbishops and other Florentine dignitaries.

===Russian Icons Museum===
Grand Dukes of Lorrain collected icons of Russia, which were formerly displayed in the Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia. The collection, mostly showcasing 18th-century icons from Moscow and Novgorod, was opened in a renewed display in the Cosimo III summer apartments on the ground floor in 2022. The visit of this museum also includes the neoclassical Palace Chapel (&quot;Cappella Palatina&quot;), decorated by Luigi Ademollo.

==The palazzo today==
Today, transformed from a royal palace to a museum, the Palazzo Pitti is owned by the Italian state. Once under the management of the Polo Museale Fiorentino, an institution which administered twenty museums, since 2015 it has been a department of the Gallerie degli Uffizi, as a separate and independent structure within the Ministry of Culture, and has ultimate responsibility for 250,000 catalogued works of art. In spite of its metamorphosis from royal residence to a state-owned public building, the palazzo, sitting on its elevated site overlooking Florence, still retains the air and atmosphere of a private collection in a grand house. This is to a great extent due to the Amici di Palazzo Pitti (Friends of the Palazzo Pitti), an organisation of volunteers and patrons founded in 1996, which raises funds and makes suggestions for the ongoing maintenance of the palazzo and the collections, and for the continuing improvement of their visual display.

==Pastiche==
The Königsbau wing (&#x27;King&#x27;s building / den&#x27;) of the Munich Residenz, the former royal palace in the capital of Bavaria, was modelled after the Palazzo Pitti.

<doc id="1081030" wikidata="Q1849355" url="?curid=1081030" title="Mike Scott (Scottish musician)">
<text>Michael Scott (born 14 December 1958) is a Scottish singer, songwriter, and musician. He is the founding member, lead singer, guitarist and songwriter of rock band The Waterboys. He has also produced two solo albums, &quot;Bring &#x27;Em All In&quot; and &quot;Still Burning&quot;. Scott is a vocalist, guitarist and pianist, and has played a large range of other instruments, including the bouzouki, drums, and Hammond organ on his albums. Scott is also a published writer, having released his autobiography, &quot;Adventures of a Waterboy&quot;, in 2012.

Having begun a musical career in the 1970s, Scott has been making music professionally since the 1980s and is well known for his radical changes in music genres throughout what he refers to as his &quot;allegedly unorthodox&quot; career. Scott lives in Dublin, Ireland.

==Early life and education==

Scott was born and raised in Edinburgh, the son of Allan and Anne Scott. His father left the family when Mike was ten years old, but the two were reunited in 2007. Scott&#x27;s mother was an English teacher, exposing him to the greats of English literature from a young age.

Scott was interested in music from an early age. At age 12, after the family had moved to Ayr, he began a serious interest in learning guitar. Scott remembers that, &quot;from the minute [he] bought&quot; &#x27;Last Night in Soho&#x27; by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich in 1968 &quot;knew [he] had to be in music&quot;, and mentions listening to Hank Williams as a &quot;life-changing&quot; experience. The next year, Scott was playing in school bands and formed the band Karma, named after the tenet in Hinduism, with a friend named John Caldwell. Karma&#x27;s sound was inspired by David Bowie, The Beatles and Bob Dylan.

In 1977 Scott entered the University of Edinburgh, studying English literature and philosophy. Scott would later arrange poetry from William Butler Yeats, Robert Burns, and George MacDonald for The Waterboys recordings. Other literary influences on Scott&#x27;s career include C. S. Lewis and &quot;The Diary of Vikenty Angarov&quot;. Scott left the University of Edinburgh after his first year.

Scott became interested in the British punk music scene, and began writing for fanzines, eventually starting his own, &quot;Jungleland&quot;. Scott was especially interested in the music of The Clash and Patti Smith, a tribute to whom, &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot;, would become the first Waterboys single.

==Pre-Waterboys musical career==
Scott and a guitarist named Allan McConnell formed a band, The Bootlegs, which gave way to Another Pretty Face in 1978 when Caldwell and two other friends joined. The friends created their own record label, named New Pleasures, &quot;obtained financial backing from the enigmatically named Z&quot; and began releasing Another Pretty Face&#x27;s singles. The band achieved some success with their first single &quot;All the Boys Love Carrie&quot; / &quot;That&#x27;s Not Enough&quot; when &quot;New Musical Express&quot; named it &quot;Single of the Week&quot;. The band signed a contract with Virgin Records, was featured on the cover of Sounds (magazine), and toured with Stiff Little Fingers. Virgin, after receiving a demo tape from Another Pretty Face, released the band four months after the signing. Nikki Sudden, who had interviewed Another Pretty Face in Edinburgh for ZigZag (magazine), asserts that &quot;the APF stuff is still some of Mike Scott’s best work&quot;.

In 1980 through 1982 Scott, amongst other projects, worked occasionally with Sudden. Another Pretty Face continued to release music and recorded a Peel Session on 18 February 1981. The band eventually came to the attention of Nigel Grainge, founder of Ensign Records. Grainge signed Another Pretty Face to the label, and the band moved to London, changing its name to Funhouse (taken from the name of The Stooges&#x27; album &quot;Fun House&quot;). Scott had become dissatisfied with the band. He later described Funhouse&#x27;s sound as &quot;similar to a jumbo jet flying on one engine&quot;. Scott began working on solo songs and recordings, a decision that led to the creation of The Waterboys. A December 1981 session at Redshop Studios formed the beginnings of The Waterboys&#x27; first album, &quot;The Waterboys&quot;.

==The Waterboys==

The Waterboys&#x27; membership has changed a great deal throughout the group&#x27;s existence. Anthony Thistlethwaite, Karl Wallinger, Kevin Wilkinson and Steve Wickham all made major contributions, but Scott describes the band as his project. &quot;[T]o me there&#x27;s no difference between Mike Scott and the Waterboys; they both mean the same thing. They mean myself and whoever are my current travelling musical companions.&quot; The Waterboys&#x27; first release was a single of &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot; in March 1983. The first album came out that June. Along with &quot;The Waterboys&quot;, the next two albums, &quot;A Pagan Place&quot; and &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;, released in 1984 and 1985, contained songs mostly written by Scott, and together formed the band&#x27;s &quot;Big Music&quot; period. After the official addition of fiddler Steve Wickham and a move to Ireland, the next two albums &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1988) and &quot;Room to Roam&quot; (1990) were instead Celtic music-inspired folk music, a sound similar to that of We Free Kings, a band that Scott and Wickham performed with in 1986. Scott&#x27;s musical style changed again to a more guitar based sound when he, under the name The Waterboys but without any other members, recorded &quot;Dream Harder&quot;, in 1993. It was a return to the &quot;Big Music&quot; sound but the last album to come out under the band&#x27;s name until 2000. The band had dissolved over personnel issues and Wickham&#x27;s desire to remain with a folk-rock, or purely folk music, sound. After two Mike Scott solo albums, &quot;A Rock in the Weary Land&quot; was released under The Waterboys name, demonstrating yet another musical style, which Scott called &quot;Sonic rock&quot;. 2002&#x27;s &quot;Universal Hall&quot; was a return to a folk-rock sound. It was followed by &quot;Karma to Burn&quot;, released in 2005, which was the group&#x27;s first official live album, &quot;Book of Lightning&quot;, released in 2007, and &quot;An Appointment With Mr Yeats&quot;, released in 2011.

==Solo albums==
In addition to the albums he released with The Waterboys, Scott released two solo albums in the 1990s. The first &quot;Bring &#x27;Em All In&quot; (1995), was recorded at the Findhorn Foundation in north Scotland, with Mike Scott playing all instruments himself. Musician and author Daniel Levitin ends his 2009 book &quot;The World in Six Songs&quot; with an extended discussion of the song &quot;Bring &#x27;Em All In&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the greatest love songs ever written.&quot;

For his second solo album, &quot;Still Burning&quot; (1997), Scott assembled a group of session musicians including Pino Palladino and Jim Keltner. Guesting on the album was former Icicle Works frontman Ian McNabb. Songs from the two albums appeared on 1998&#x27;s compilation album &quot;The Whole of the Moon: The Music of Mike Scott and the Waterboys&quot; along with songs from The Waterboys.

Scott&#x27;s solo albums were positively received by critics but sales were significantly down from Waterboys releases. Following the commercial failure of &quot;Still Burning&quot; in 1997 Scott was dropped by Chrysalis Records and decided to revive the Waterboys name to achieve wider marketplace exposure, a process described in detail in his autobiography.

Scott created his own record label in 2003, Puck Records, which released The Waterboys&#x27; &quot;Universal Hall&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Karma to Burn&quot; was released, also by Puck Records, and included tracks from Scott&#x27;s solo career played by The Waterboys line-up at the time.

After years in the making, Scott produced his show &quot;An Appointment with Mr. Yeats&quot;, which debuted in Dublin, in Yeats&#x27; own Abbey Theatre. In the show, Scott is accompanied by Steve Wickham and other musicians, and the poetry of W. B. Yeats is put to music by Scott. The show ran from 15 to 20 March 2010.

<doc id="1081037" wikidata="Q917652" url="?curid=1081037" title="Gadsden flag">
<text>The Gadsden flag is a historical American flag with a yellow field depicting a timber rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike. Beneath the rattlesnake are the words Dont Tread on Me. Some modern versions of the flag include an apostrophe in the word &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;.

The flag is named after Christopher Gadsden, a South Carolinian delegate to the Continental Congress and brigadier general in the Continental Army, who designed the flag in 1775 during the American Revolution. He gave the flag to Commodore Esek Hopkins, and it was unfurled on the main mast of Hopkins&#x27; flagship USS &quot;Alfred&quot; on December 20, 1775. Two days later, Congress made Hopkins commander-in-chief of the Continental Navy. He adopted the Gadsden banner as his personal flag, flying it from the mainmast of the flagship while he was aboard. The Continental Marines also flew the flag during the early part of the war.

The rattlesnake was a symbol of the unity of the Thirteen Colonies at the start of the Revolutionary War, and it had a long history as a political symbol in America. Benjamin Franklin used it for his &quot;Join, or Die&quot; woodcut in 1754. Gadsden intended his flag to serve as a physical symbol of the American Revolution&#x27;s ideals.

The flag has been described as the &quot;most popular symbol of the American Revolution&quot;. Its design proclaims an assertive warning of vigilance and willingness to act in defense against coercion. This has led it to be associated with the ideas of individualism and liberty. It is often used in the United States as a symbol of right-libertarianism, classical liberalism, and small government, as well as for distrust or defiance against authorities and government.

==Appearance and symbolism==
===Variations in appearance===
Many variations of the Gadsden flag exist. The motto may or may not include an apostrophe in the word &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;; the typeface used for the motto may or may not use a serif typeface. The rattlesnake is sometimes shown as resting on a green ground; representations dating from 1885 and 1917 do not display anything below the rattlesnake. The rattlesnake usually faces to the left, and the early representations mentioned above face left. However, some versions of the flag show the snake facing to the right.

===History of the rattlesnake symbol in America===

The timber rattlesnake can be found in the area of the original Thirteen Colonies. Like the bald eagle, part of its significance is that it was unique to the Americas, serving as a means of showing a separate identity from the Old World. Its use as a symbol of the American colonies can be traced back to the publications of Benjamin Franklin. In 1751, he made the first reference to the rattlesnake in a satirical commentary published in his &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;. It had become the policy of the British Parliament to send convicted criminals to Britain&#x27;s North American colonies (primarily the Province of Georgia), so Franklin suggested that Americans thank Parliament by sending rattlesnakes to Britain.

In 1754, during the French and Indian War, Franklin published &quot;Join, or Die&quot;, a woodcut of a snake cut into eight sections. It represented the colonies, with New England joined as the head and South Carolina as the tail, following their order along the coast. This was the first political cartoon published in an American newspaper.

In 1774, Paul Revere added Franklin&#x27;s iconic cartoon to the nameplate of Isaiah Thomas&#x27;s paper, the &quot;Massachusetts Spy&quot;, depicted there as fighting a British griffin.

In December 1775, Benjamin Franklin published an essay in the &quot;Pennsylvania Journal&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;American Guesser&quot; in which he suggested that the rattlesnake was a good symbol for the American spirit and its valuation for vigilance, assertiveness, individualism, unity, and liberty:[...] there was painted a Rattle-Snake, with this modest motto under it, &quot;Don&#x27;t tread on me.&quot; [...] she has no eye-lids. She may therefore be esteemed an emblem of vigilance. She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever surrenders [...] The Rattle-Snake is solitary, and associates with her kind only when it is necessary for their preservation [...] &#x27;Tis curious and amazing to observe how distinct and independent of each other the rattles of this animal are, and yet how firmly they are united together, so as never to be separated but by breaking them to pieces. [...] The power of fascination attributed to her, by a generous construction, may be understood to mean, that those who consider the liberty and blessings which America affords, and once come over to her, never afterwards leave her, but spend their lives with her.
The rattlesnake symbol was first officially adopted by the Continental Congress in 1778 when it approved the design for the seal of the War Office. At the top center of the seal is a rattlesnake holding a banner that says, &quot;This we&#x27;ll defend&quot;. This design of the War Office seal was carried forward—with some minor modifications—into the subsequent designs as well as the Department of the Army&#x27;s seal, emblem and flag. As such, some variation of a rattlesnake symbol has been in continuous official use by the US Army for over 243 years.

Other American flags that use a rattlesnake motif include The United Companies of the Train of Artillery of the Town of Providence, the First Navy Jack, and the Culpeper Minutemen flag, among others.

In the 21st century, the Gadsden Flag has been used by supporters of the Tea Party movement.

==History==
George Washington established the Continental Navy in 1775 as Commander in Chief of the Continental Forces, before Esek Hopkins was named Commodore of the Navy. The first ships were used to intercept incoming transport ships carrying war supplies to the British in the colonies in order to supply the Continental Army, which was desperately undersupplied in the opening years of the American Revolutionary War.

Continental Colonel Christopher Gadsden represented South Carolina in the Congress, and he was one of seven members of the Marine Committee outfitting the first naval mission. Paul Aron described Gadsden as a &quot;leading advocate of an American navy.&quot; The first Marines carried drums painted yellow and depicting a coiled rattlesnake with thirteen rattles along with the motto &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me.&quot; This is the first recorded mention of the flag&#x27;s symbolism.

Gadsden decided that the American navy needed a distinctive flag and took it upon himself to make one in 1775. He gave Commodore Esek Hopkins a yellow rattlesnake flag to serve as his personal standard on USS &quot;Alfred&quot;, the flagship of America&#x27;s first navy squadron. Gadsden intended the design to serve as a physical symbol of the American Revolution&#x27;s ideals. The rattlesnake was seen in Charleston, South Carolina as a &quot;noble and useful&quot; animal that gave warning before it attacked. Before being appointed to lead the Navy, Hopkins had led The United Companies of the Train of Artillery of the Town of Providence, a unit that flew a flag similar to Gadsden&#x27;s. He unfurled the Gadsden flag on the main mast of USS &quot;Alfred&quot; on December 20, 1775, while the ship was at anchor in Chesapeake Bay. Whenever he was aboard, Hopkins flew the flag from the mainmast of the flagship as his personal banner. &quot;Alfred&quot; was also the first recorded ship to fly the Grand Union Flag, the first national flag of the United States, when Senior Lieutenant John Paul Jones hoisted it on December 3, 1775, while the ship floated in the Delaware River near Philadelphia.

By winter 1775, the South Carolina Provincial Congress expected that British forces would attack Charleston and recalled Gadsden home from Congress in Philadelphia to command the 1st South Carolina Regiment. By January 14, Gadsden had both his orders to return home and permission from the Continental Congress to leave. On Friday, February 9, 1776, he presented an example of his yellow rattlesnake flag to president of the Congress William Henry Drayton.

Gadsden&#x27;s presentation of the rattlesnake flag was recorded in the South Carolina congressional journals on February 9, 1776:

In 1861, a ship from Georgia entered Boston Harbor flying a version of the Gadsden Flag with 15 stars on it signifying the 15 slave states. The captain removed the flag after a large and angry crowd gathered, who then destroyed it.

==Modern use==

For historical reasons, the Gadsden flag is still popularly flown in Charleston, South Carolina, the city where Christopher Gadsden first presented the flag and where it was commonly used during the revolution, along with the blue and white crescent flag of pre-Civil War South Carolina.

The Gadsden flag has become a popular specialty license plate in several states. , the following states offer the option of obtaining a Gadsden flag specialty license plate: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.

===Use as a libertarian symbol===
In the 1970s, libertarians began using the Gadsden flag as a symbol to represent individual rights and limited government. The flag&#x27;s prominent yellow or gold color is also strongly associated with libertarianism.
The libertarian Free State Project in New Hampshire uses a modified version of the flag with the snake replaced by a porcupine, a symbol of the libertarian movement.

Other libertarian variants of the flag have changed the words &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread On Me&quot; to &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread On Anyone&quot;, in one version replacing the single snake with multiple snakes of different colors, or in other cases with a porcupine.

===Use by the left===
In the mid-1970s, the New Left People&#x27;s Bicentennial Commission used the Gadsden flag symbolism on buttons and literature.

Following &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which struck down &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, abortion rights activists were seen at a Texas rally carrying a version of the flag with the snake in the shape of a human uterus. This design was created by Anne Lesniak.

===Use by the right===

The Gadsden flag has also been used by groups and individuals on the right. The Gadsden flag was featured prominently in a report related to the January 6, 2021, attack of the United States Capitol.

===Use as a symbol of the Tea Party movement===
Beginning in 2009, the Gadsden flag was widely used as a protest symbol by protesters who supported the American Tea Party movement. It was also displayed by members of Congress at Tea Party rallies. In some cases, the flag was ruled to be a political, rather than a historic or military, symbol due to the strong Tea Party connection.

===Used in a terrorist act===
In 2014, the flag was used by Jerad and Amanda Miller, the perpetrators of the 2014 Las Vegas shootings who killed two police officers and a citizen. The Millers reportedly placed the Gadsden Flag on the corpse of one of the officers they killed.

===Legal cases involving the Gadsden flag===
In March 2013, the Gadsden flag was raised at a vacant armory building in New Rochelle, New York, without permission from city officials. The city ordered its removal and the United Veterans Memorial &amp; Patriotic Association, which had maintained the U.S. flag at the armory, filed suit against the city. A federal judge dismissed the case, rejecting the United Veterans&#x27; First Amendment argument and ruling that the flagpole in question was city property and thus did not represent private speech.

In 2014, a US Postal Service employee filed a complaint about a coworker repeatedly wearing a hat with a Gadsden Flag motif at work. Postal service administration dismissed the complaint, but the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reversed the decision and called for a careful investigation. The EEOC issued a statement clarifying that it did not make any decision that the Gadsden flag was a &quot;racist symbol,&quot; or that wearing a depiction of it constituted racial discrimination.

In 2023, a seventh grader at The Vanguard School in Colorado Springs was removed from school for wearing several patches that were &quot;in violation of the school’s dress code policy&quot; including a Gadsden flag patch. After high-profile backlash against the decision, including criticism from Governor Jared Polis, the school reversed its decision.

===Rainbow version===

Street Patrol, a 1990s queer self-defense group affiliated with Queer Nation/San Francisco, used as its logo a coiled snake over a triangle holding a ribbon with the motto &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot;. Some libertarian circles use a version of the flag with the snake and motto placed over a rainbow flag. Following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, posters containing a rainbow Gadsden flag inscribed with &quot;#ShootBack&quot; were placed around West Hollywood.

===Use outside the U.S.===
The Gadsden flag has been used by supporters of Argentine right-libertarian president Javier Milei. During Milei&#x27;s inauguration, there were Gadsden flags flown which is one of the first times the flag was flown with notability in a foreign inauguration.

===Parodies===

Parodies and pastiches of the Gadsden flag exist; one common design replaces the &quot;Don&#x27;t tread on me&quot; motto with &quot;No Step on &quot;, sometimes paired with a crudely drawn snake.

==Appearances in popular culture==
The Gadsden flag has made numerous appearances in popular culture, particularly in post-apocalyptic stories.

===In art===
* The Freedom Train, a graffiti artwork painted in 1976, incorporated the Gadsden flag in its design.

===In film and television===
* In the 1982 film &quot;Tootsie&quot;, the character of Jeff Slater (Bill Murray) is shown to have the Gadsden flag displayed in his bedroom.
* In the 1985 film &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, the character of Paulie (Burt Young) wears a coat with the flag on the back while in Russia.
* In the 1995 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart vs. Australia&quot;, Bart reveals in an act of patriotism the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread On Me&quot; written across his buttocks when he is supposed to be kicked by the Australian Prime Minister as a punishment.
*In the 1999 drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, the character of Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) is shown to have the Gadsden flag displayed in this office.
* In the 2000 film &quot;The Patriot&quot;, the flag is shown being flown by American troops during the Battle of Cowpens.
* In the 2006 CBS apocalyptic drama series &quot;Jericho&quot;, Gadsden flags are shown several times, most notably in the series finale when Jericho&#x27;s mayor, Gray Anderson (Michael Gaston), replaces the town hall&#x27;s &quot;Allied States of America&quot; flag with a Gadsden flag.
*In the 2009 NBC mockumentary sitcom &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) has a miniature Gadsden flag in his office.
* In the 2023 HBO apocalyptic drama series &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, Bill (Nick Offerman) has a Gadsden flag in his house.

===In music===
* American heavy metal band Metallica recorded a song called &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; on their self-titled fifth studio album, released in 1991. The album cover features a dark-gray picture of a coiled rattlesnake like the one found on the Gadsden Flag.
* American country singer Granger Smith recorded a song called “Don’t Tread On Me,” which was featured on his 9th studio album “When The Good Guys Win.” The song also featured his alter ego, Earl Dibbles Jr.
* American rapper Lil Darkie recorded a song called &quot;DON&#x27;T TREAD ON ME&quot;, released in 2019, in regard to the New Zealand Mosque Shootings. The cover art depicts Lil Darkie&#x27;s self drawn character as the rattlesnake on the Gadsden Flag.

<text>In political science, the term polyarchy ( &quot;many&quot;, &quot;arkhe&quot; &quot;rule&quot;) was used by Robert A. Dahl to describe a form of government in which power is invested in multiple people. It takes the form of neither a dictatorship nor a democracy. This form of government was first implemented in the United States and France and gradually adopted by other countries. Polyarchy is different from democracy, according to Dahl, because the fundamental democratic principle is &quot;the continuing responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens, considered as political equals&quot; with unimpaired opportunities. A polyarchy is a form of government that has certain procedures that are necessary conditions for following the democratic principle.

In semblance, the word &quot;polycracy&quot; describes the same form of government, although from a slightly different premise: a polycracy is a society ruled by more than one person, as opposed to a monocracy. The word derives from Greek &quot;poly&quot; (&quot;many&quot;) and &quot;kratos&quot; (&quot;rule&quot; or &quot;strength&quot;).

== Definitions ==
Dahl&#x27;s original theory of polyarchal democracy is in his 1956 book &quot;A Preface to Democratic Theory&quot;. His theory evolved over the decades, and the description in later writings is somewhat different.

Dahl argues that &quot;democracy&quot; is an ideal type that no country has ever achieved. For Dahl, democracy is a system that is &quot;completely responsive to all its citizens&quot;, and the closest to the democratic ideal any country has come is polyarchy.

=== &quot;A Preface to Democratic Theory&quot; ===
In the book, Dahl gives eight conditions that measure the extent to which majority rule is in effect in an organization. These are (p. 84):

*Every member of the organization performs the acts we assume to constitute an expression of preference among the scheduled alternatives, e.g., voting.
*In tabulating these expressions (votes), the weight assigned to each individual is identical.
*The alternative with the greatest number of votes is declared the winning choice.
*Any member who perceives a set of alternatives, at least one of which he regards as preferable to any of the alternatives presently scheduled, can insert his preferred alternative(s) among those scheduled for voting.
*All individuals possess identical information about the alternatives.
*Alternatives (leaders or policies) with the greatest number of votes displace any alternatives (leaders or policies) with fewer votes.
*The orders of elected officials are executed.
*Either all interelection decisions are subordinate or executory to those arrived at during the election stage, i.e., elections are in a sense controlling; or new decisions during the interelection period are governed by the preceding seven conditions, operating, however, under rather different institutional circumstances; or both.

Dahl hypothesized that each of these conditions can be quantified, and suggested the term &quot;polyarchy&quot; to describe an organization that scores high on the scales for all the eight conditions.

Dahl viewed polyarchy as a system that manages to supply a high level of inclusiveness and a high level of liberalization to its citizens.

=== &quot;Democracy and its critics&quot; ===
In his 1989 book &quot;Democracy and Its Critics&quot;, Dahl gives the following characteristics of a polyarchy (p. 233):

*Control over governmental decisions about policy is constitutionally vested in elected officials.
*Elected officials are chosen and peacefully removed in relatively frequent, fair and free elections in which coercion is quite limited.
*Practically all adults have the right to vote in these elections.
*Most adults also have the right to run for the public offices for which candidates run in these elections.
*Citizens have an effectively enforced right to freedom of expression, particularly political expression, including criticism of the officials, the conduct of the government, the prevailing political, economic, and social system, and the dominant ideology.
*They also have access to alternative sources of information that are not monopolized by the government or any other single group.
*Finally, they have an effectively enforced right to form and join autonomous associations, including political associations, such as political parties and interest groups, that attempt to influence the government by competing in elections and by other peaceful means.

== Characteristics ==
Polyarchy and its procedures may be insufficient for achieving full democracy. For example, poor people may be unable to participate in the political process. Some authors see polyarchy as a form of government that is not intended for greater social justice or cultural realization or to allow the repressed to politically participate.

According to William I. Robinson, it is a system where a small group actually rules on behalf of capital, and the majority’s decision-making is confined to choosing among a select number of elites within tightly controlled elective processes. It is a form of consensual domination made possible by the structural domination of the global capital, which allows concentration of political power. Robert A. Dahl and Charles E. Lindblom noted that political bargaining is an essential feature of polyarchy, particularly in the US.

Moreover, a perceived polyarchy—such as the United States—may bar a substantial number of its citizens from participating in its electoral process. For example, more than four million U.S. citizens residing in the U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are excluded from participating in the election of any voting member of Congress, the political body that holds ultimate sovereignty over them. Robinson argues that they are effectively taxed without lawful representation (although these territories&#x27; status is a matter of popular consensus in individual cases).

In &quot;Preface to Democratic Theory&quot; (1956), Dahl argues that an increase in citizen political involvement may not always be beneficial for polyarchy. An increase in the political participation of members of less educated classes, for example, could reduce the support for the basic norms of polyarchy, because members of those classes are more predisposed to be authoritarian-minded.

In a discussion of contemporary British foreign policy, Mark Curtis writes, &quot;Polyarchy is generally what British leaders mean when they speak of promoting &#x27;democracy&#x27; abroad. This is a system in which a small group actually rules and mass participation is confined to choosing leaders in elections managed by competing elites.&quot;

It is also being promoted by the transnational elites in the South as a different form from the authoritarianism and dictatorship to the North as a part of democracy promotion. Robinson argues that this is to cultivate transnational elites who will open up their countries following the transnational agenda of neoliberalism, whereby transnational capital mobility and globalized circuits of production and distribution are established. For example, it was promoted to Nicaragua, Chile, Haiti, the Philippines, South Africa and the former Soviet Bloc countries.

<text>Number 16 Squadron Royal Air Force, nicknamed &#x27;the Saints&#x27;, is a flying squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF) who currently provide elementary flying training (EFT) with the Grob Tutor T1, presently based at RAF Wittering, an RAF airbase in Cambridgeshire, England. 

It originally formed as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1915, at Saint-Omer, France, to carry out a mixture of offensive patrolling and reconnaissance, and was disbanded in 1919, shortly after the end of the First World War. The squadron reformed as part of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1924, and again took on a reconnaissance role which it continued throughout the Second World War. Post-war, the squadron was disbanded and reformed several times, and was converted to a bomber squadron. Equipped with the Tornado GR1 from 1984, the squadron took part in the Gulf War in 1990. It was reformed in November 1991 as the operational conversion unit (OCU) for the Jaguar, until the Jaguar&#x27;s imminent withdrawal from service in 2005. No. 16 Squadron reformed again and took on its current role in 2008.

==History==
===Early years===

The squadron was formed at Saint-Omer, France on 10 February 1915, from elements of No. 2, No. 6, and No. 9 Squadron RFC. It immediately began fighting in the First World War under Hugh Dowding, and for some time was based at the aerodrome at the Beaupré-sur-la-Lys Abbey in La Gorgue. For the rest of the Great War, the &#x27;Saints&#x27; were deployed throughout Northern France and operated a mixture of aircraft including Bleriot XI, Martinsyde S.1 and Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c on offensive patrol and tactical reconnaissance duties. Disbandment occurred on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1919.

In September 1915, Duncan Grinnell-Milne joined the squadron as a junior pilot, and later (1933) published an account of his time in the squadron. His portrait of Dowding (who when the book was originally published had not then attained his later fame) is unflattering.

The squadron was reformed at Old Sarum in Wiltshire in the tactical reconnaissance role on 1 April 1924. Initially, it operated the Bristol Fighter, but this was replaced by the Atlas in January 1931, and by the Audax in December 1933.

===Second World War===

In May 1938, the Westland Lysander arrived, and the Squadron continued in its tactical role in wartime France from April 1940. In May 1940, it returned to England and conducted roving sea patrols searching for both downed aircrew and enemy forces.

From April 1942, 16 Squadron was re-equipped with the Allison-engined North American Mustang I for fighter sweeps and reconnaissance duties over France from its base at RAF Weston Zoyland in Somerset. The Spitfire Mk.V took over this role from September 1943. On 2 June 1943, the Squadron became part of the Strategic Reconnaissance Wing of the 2nd Tactical Air Force (2TAF) as a high-altitude photo reconnaissance unit with Spitfire PR Mk.IXs based at Hartford Bridge. In the build-up to D Day, No 16 supplied photographs instrumental to the planning of the Allied landings.

===Cold War (1946–1991)===

No. 16 Squadron was disbanded at RAF Celle on but reformed at RAF Fassberg the same day, and took the 24 cylinder H-engined Hawker Tempest Mk.V on charge, until converting to the radial-engined Mk.II on 7 June 1946. On 7 December 1948, the squadron took delivery of its first jet engined aircraft, the de Havilland Vampire FB.5, which subsequently gave way to the de Havilland Venom FB.1 in November 1954 until disbandment at Celle once more on .
As East-West relations cooled, the Squadron reformed at RAF Laarbruch in West Germany on 1 March 1958. No. 16 Squadron maintained a permanent readiness state, tasked with meeting the Soviet threat, in the expected conventional phase and with the use of tactical nuclear weapons. The squadron was re-quipped with the Canberra B(I).8 armed with the WE.177, a dual-key free-fall nuclear bomb.

The Canberra gave way to the Buccaneer S.2B on 16 October 1972. The squadron&#x27;s twelve Buccaneers were equipped with a variety of conventional weapons and eighteen British WE.177 nuclear bombs. Although Buccaneers could carry two WE.177 weapons, after taking into account attrition in the conventional phase of a high-intensity European war, and after withholding some aircraft in reserve, RAF planners expected that squadron strength remaining would still be sufficient to deliver the nuclear weapons stockpile. The Buccaneer distinguished itself in many bombing exercises; among its victories included the winning of the Salmond Trophy in 1978 and 1979.

The squadron briefly expanded in 1983-1984, absorbing some aircraft and personnel from its sister 15 Squadron which had converted to the Panavia Tornado GR1. 16 Squadron followed in late 1984 following the &#x27;designate&#x27; process where a new 16 Squadron &#x27;formed up&#x27; at RAF Honington, before moving to Laarbruch and assuming the squadron standard from the Buccaneer unit which had continued to operate throughout. Despite the change of aircraft, the squadron&#x27;s role remained unchanged in countering a Soviet threat in Europe with conventional weapons and eighteen WE.177 nuclear bombs. As with the Buccaneer, there was a ratio of 1.5 weapons per aircraft.
Ahead of Operation GRANBY in 1990 and the first Gulf War, the squadron deployed to Tabuk airbase. No. 16 was the lead squadron in the deployment, with No. 20 and crews from other Tornado GR1 squadrons. The &#x27;Tabuk Force&#x27; used JP233s and bombs on low-level sorties against Iraqi airfields and other targets. Some of the Squadron&#x27;s aircraft later formed a TIALD flight that conducted accurate medium-level bombing. 

Following hostilities, the Squadron disbanded on .

===SEPECAT Jaguar (1991–2005)===

On 1 November 1991, the Squadron reformed at RAF Lossiemouth as No. 16(Reserve) Squadron, a reserve squadron and an operational conversion unit (OCU), replacing and taking over the aircraft and weapons of No. 226 OCU, training and converting new pilots for the SEPECAT Jaguar. Although no longer a front-line operational squadron, as a reserve, or shadow squadron, its twelve aircraft were equipped with conventional weapons and eight WE.177 nuclear weapons for use in a high-intensity European war, and it remained assigned to SACEUR for that purpose.

Although a non-operational squadron, its pilots were still involved in Operation DENY FLIGHT and Operation NORTHERN WATCH. The squadron moved to RAF Coltishall in Norfolk, on 21 July 2000, thus consolidating the RAF&#x27;s entire Jaguar force at one airbase, joining numbers 6, 41, and 54 squadrons.

In December 2003, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced with the Delivering Security in a Changing World defence review, RAF Coltishall would close in 2007, and the recently upgraded Jaguar fleet would be retired early. This led to the disbandment of No. 16 Squadron on 11 March 2005 as the Jaguar approached retirement. The Squadron Standard was laid up in Notre-Dame Cathedral Saint-Omer, France on 20 March 2005.

===Elementary flying training (2008–present)===
On 1 October 2008, the squadron was reformed at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, as part of No. 22 Group, operating the Grob Tutor T1. No. 16(R) Squadron continues its training role by instructing new Royal Air Force (RAF) pilots in elementary flying training (EFT) as part of No.1 Elementary Flying Training School (1EFTS). From 2005 to 2008, the unit was known as 1 Squadron, 1 EFTS following a restructuring of the RAF&#x27;s pilot training.

In the first half of 2015, No. 16(R) Squadron, along with No. 115(R) Squadron relocated to RAF Wittering, Cambridgeshire, which saw flying return to the base for the first time since 2010.

<text>Microsystems International Limited (MIL) was a telecommunications microelectronics company based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, founded in 1969. MIL was an early attempt to create a merchant semiconductor house by Nortel Networks (then Northern Electric).

MIL is historically important as the producers of one of the world&#x27;s earliest microprocessors, the MIL MF7114, which was based on the design of the Intel 4004. MIL also produced a series of early microcomputers using this chip, including the MIL CPS-1, which may be the earliest example of a microcomputer system that was shipped in completed form, as opposed to a kit that had to be assembled. Several other upgraded models followed.

==History==

Electronic manufacturers were at that time forced to create custom integrated circuits due to the lack of industry standard ICs. MIL was an attempt to create a merchant company that could supply such standard devices as well as custom devices for Northern Electric products. Northern Electric entered the field partly at the urging of the Canadian federal government even though it had strong doubts of the viability of the company.
MIL manufactured both bipolar and MOS semiconductor devices, including standard TTL digital logic components and linear products such as operational amplifiers, as well as a variety of memory components. In 1971, MIL became a second source for the Intel 1103 DRAM IC. The licensing fee paid by MIL to Intel meant that Intel could show a profit in 1971 for the first time in its history.

MIL was never able to show a profit and losses were exacerbated by the semiconductor market downturn in 1974. It was purchased and folded into Nortel&#x27;s research arm Bell-Northern Research and later merged into Nortel. MIL was purchased and folded into Nortel&#x27;s research arm Bell-Northern Research in 1974. The MIL fabrication facility continued to operate as the largest semiconductor fab in Canada until Nortel&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2009.

==Spinoffs==
MIL&#x27;s most lasting contribution is that it was the meeting place for the entrepreneurs Terry Matthews and Michael Cowpland. The pair left the company to found much of the high tech industry in Kanata, Ontario, Canada. They started Mitel together. Cowpland later started Corel. Matthews later started Newbridge Networks. Cowpland&#x27;s boss at MIL cautioned him against leaving the security of a large company just a few months before MIL was wound up.

Another partnership formed at MIL was that of Dick Foss and Bob Harland who, on their return from the 1975 ISSCC conference where they had presented their paper on MIL&#x27;s 4k DRAM, found that they were no longer employed. They started MOSAID initially as a memory design house and branched out into other related areas such as reverse engineering, EDA software, and memory test equipment manufacturing. The reverse engineering business was spun off in 1989 as Semiconductor Insights, now TechInsights.

<text>PALASM is an early hardware description language, used to translate Boolean functions and state transition tables into a fuse map for use with Programmable Array Logic (PAL) devices introduced by Monolithic Memories, Inc. (MMI). The language was developed by John Birkner in the early 1980s. It is not case-sensitive. 
The PALASM compiler was written by MMI in FORTRAN IV on an IBM 370/168. MMI made the source code available to users at no cost. By 1983, MMI customers ran versions on the DEC PDP-11, Data General NOVA, Hewlett-Packard HP 2100, MDS800 and others. A widely used MS-DOS port was produced by MMI. There was a Windows front-end written sometime later.

<text>Sandra Pupatello (née Pizzolitto; born October 6, 1962) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. She served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2011 as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party, serving as a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty. She did not run in the 2011 provincial election and took a position as director of business and global markets at PricewaterhouseCoopers. On November 8, 2012, Pupatello announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Ontario. On January 26, 2013, she lost to Kathleen Wynne on the third and final ballot. Afterwards, she returned to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Pupatello served as chair of Hydro One from 2014 to 2015.

Pupatello made an unsuccessful attempt at returning to elected office in 2019 when she stood as the federal Liberal candidate in Windsor West. She placed second behind New Democratic Party incumbent Brian Masse by a margin of 1,922 votes. In the subsequent 2021 Canadian federal election, Pupatello again stood as the Liberal candidate in Windsor West. She again lost to Masse by an expanded margin of 8,032 votes.

Pupatello is married to Jim Bennett, a former leader of the Newfoundland and Labrador Liberal Party.

==Early life and career==
Pupatello was born Sandra Pizzolitto in Windsor, Ontario. She became politically active by campaigning for Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Herb Gray in the 1970s. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Windsor (1986). She remained in the city after her graduation, serving as general manager of the city&#x27;s Rotary Club and executive director of the Essex County Kidney Foundation of Canada. She was also a board member of the Windsor Regional Hospital and Windsor Regional Children&#x27;s Centre and was president of the Fogolar Furlan Club. Pupatello was named &quot;Italian of the Year&quot; for Windsor-Essex County in 1996, received the Charlie Clark Award for Outstanding Service from the University of Windsor in 2001, and was named &quot;Windsor Woman of the Year&quot; in 2003.

==Provincial politics==
Pupatello was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating New Democratic Party candidate Arlene Rousseau by 5,526 votes in Windsor—Sandwich. The seat had previously been held by New Democrat George Dadamo, who did not seek re-election. The Progressive Conservative Party won a majority government in the election, and Pupatello entered the legislature as an opposition Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP). During her first term, she served as Official Opposition Critic for Community and Social Services, Children&#x27;s Issues, Youth Issues, and the Management Board of Cabinet.

Pupatello was co-manager of Dwight Duncan&#x27;s 1996 campaign to lead the Ontario Liberal Party. Like Duncan, she supported Gerard Kennedy on the final ballot.

Pupatello was re-elected by a landslide in the 1999 provincial election for the redistributed constituency of Windsor West, while the Progressive Conservatives were re-elected to a second consecutive majority government. Pupatello remained a member of the opposition frontbench, serving over the next four years as Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Official Opposition Critic for Health and Long-Term Care.

She was a vocal critic of the Mike Harris and Ernie Eves governments, frequently criticizing cutbacks to child care and other programs. In 1997, she introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Resolution intended to stop cutbacks to hospital funding. She later criticized the Progressive Conservative government&#x27;s plans to introduce a private MRI clinic, arguing that it posed a long-term threat to public health care.

==In government==

The Liberal Party won a majority government in the 2003 provincial election, and Pupatello was again re-elected in Windsor West with a significant majority. On October 23, 2003, she was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Community and Social Services with responsibility for Women&#x27;s Issues. There was some speculation that she would be appointed Deputy Premier as well, but this position was instead left vacant until George Smitherman&#x27;s appointment in 2006. Pupatello was spoken of as a possible candidate for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party when Dalton McGuinty was to retire in 2006.

===Minister of Community and Social Services===
Pupatello&#x27;s most important responsibility in the Community and Social Services portfolio was overseeing Ontario&#x27;s welfare and disability assistance system. Shortly after taking office, she announced that her government would remove a lifetime ban on welfare recipients who are caught cheating on their applications. Pupatello described the rule as counterproductive, in that many welfare officials were reluctant to bring forward charges out of concern for the extreme punitive consequences. She also announced that her government would take greater steps to find parents who are delinquent with child support payments.

In March 2004, Pupatello announced $2 million to assist low-income Ontarians with increased hydro bills. In June, she announced $10 million to help Ontarians with physical disabilities modify their houses and cars.

Pupatello introduced a 3% social assistance rate increase in 2004, the first such increase after twelve years of freezes. Mechanical difficulties with computers purchased by the Mike Harris government subsequently delayed its implementation, and the province implemented lump-sum payments instead. Later in 2004, Pupatello announced that her government would eliminate a rule requiring welfare recipients to liquidate their education savings plans. Speaking to the media, Pupatello described the requirement as &quot;a dumb rule that works at cross-purposes to what welfare is supposed to be doing for people and their families&quot;. In 2005, she announced the creation of the &quot;JobsNow&quot; program to help welfare recipients enter the workforce.

In January 2005, Pupatello was appointed to chair an ad hoc cabinet committee on the modernization of government.

Pupatello spearheaded passage of the &quot;Adoption Information Disclosure Act&quot; in 2005, allowing birth records to be released to adoptees. Ontario Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian was a critic of the bill, arguing that it was not sufficiently respectful of the promises of anonymity made to birth parents at the time of adoption. Pupatello argued that the bill was necessary to provide adoptees with information about their personal history, and has noted that it provides safeguards for instances where safety issues are a concern.

In November 2005, the Ministry of Community and Social Services, under Pupatello&#x27;s leadership, rolled out a series of amendments to the special diet allowance, a program which provides additional funding of up to $250 per month for social assistance recipients to cover the increased costs of certain medically related diets. Groups such as the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty had previously encouraged recipients to apply for the benefit and there had been a significant increase in the number of requests. Pupatello argued that there was a loophole in the program, it was being exploited by activist groups and that the resulting drain on the system needed to be corrected. Several anti-poverty groups criticized the decision. In February 2008, the Ontario Human Rights Commission referred a group of complaints to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, asserting that the 2005 amendments violated the Ontario Human Rights Code. The Tribunal hearings are scheduled to take place in 2009.

Pupatello announced in January 2006 that her department would close Ontario&#x27;s three remaining government-operated institutions for mentally disabled adults, and assist the occupants with moving into more integrated community facilities. She noted that a &quot;sea change in attitude&quot; had occurred over institutionalization practices since the buildings were first established and that greater integration was now the preferred approach. Previous ministers, including John Baird, had also called for the buildings to close. Critics argued that the plan could put the patients at risk.

In March 2006, the McGuinty government was criticized for a backlog in approving provincial disability allowances. Pupatello described the backlog as &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, and announced that her ministry would work to correct it.

Social assistance rates were raised again by 2% in 2006. Pupatello also introduced policy to allow further money to be &#x27;flowed through&#x27; from the federal government&#x27;s National Child Benefit Supplement in each year since 2003. She was unable to implement a planned removal of the federal tax credit clawback and argued that the deficit inherited from the previous government made this change unviable before 2007.

===Minister of Education===
Pupatello was promoted to Minister of Education on April 5, 2006, after Gerard Kennedy resigned to run for the federal Liberal leadership. The following month, she announced that her government would give $3 million to the Kids Help Phone service to set up a 24-hour anti-bullying hotline. She also pledged more than $1 million to provide young students with swimming and water survival lessons, in the aftermath of a series of drowning deaths in the Guelph area the previous year.

In late May 2006, Pupatello introduced a strategic high school transition plan intended to reduce Ontario&#x27;s high-school dropout rate. The following month, she introduced a $50 million plan for teacher training and reduced wait times for special needs programs. She also worked toward solving the vexing issue of the teacher funding formula, a problem that the Liberals inherited from the previous government.

Pupatello also announced a comprehensive plan for changes at TV Ontario, including a greater focus on educational programming and more money for equipment upgrades. The popular Studio 2 program was cancelled, and replaced by a nightly current affairs show called &quot;The Agenda&quot;. Some opposition politicians charged political interference in the latter decision, but this was denied by both Pupatello and Studio 2 host Steve Paikin.

During the summer of 2006, Pupatello criticized a number of Ontario school boards for failing to balance their books. She appointed a financial adviser to the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board, which was experiencing difficulties balancing its budget. Pupatello also targeted administrative costs in the Toronto District School Board, arguing that the board had the means to balance its books without program cuts. In late August, she appointed two provincial representatives to review the TDSB books.

During a September 2006 by-election Parkdale—High Park, Pupatello engaged in a controversial negative campaign on behalf of Liberal candidate Sylvia Watson. She accused New Democratic Party candidate Rev. Cheri DiNovo of comparing Canada&#x27;s media coverage of serial killer Karla Homolka to the persecution of Jesus Christ, and suggested that DiNovo was unfit to run for parliament. Many argued that Pupatello took DiNovo&#x27;s words completely out of context, and opposition politicians accused the Liberals of conducting a smear campaign. The effort backfired, and DiNovo was elected by a significant margin. Pupatello has defended her role in the campaign, saying &quot;If I was presented once again with apparently what is factual and has yet to be refuted and that is sermons that were posted on the world wide web ... I would have exactly the same opinion as I do today&quot;.

===Minister of Economic Development and Trade===
Pupatello was reassigned as Minister of Economic Development and Trade on September 18, 2006, following the resignation of Joe Cordiano. This was generally interpreted as a demotion, although at least one columnist has suggested that holding an economic portfolio could help Pupatello&#x27;s long-term political ambitions.

Pupatello led provincial trade delegations to Alberta in late 2006 and early 2007, promoting Ontario&#x27;s business sector to the western province&#x27;s booming economy. She also took part in a trade mission to India and Pakistan in January 2007, and went on a four-day trade mission to Japan in April of the same year. Her department has also set up a growing number of marketing centres around the world.

===Minister Responsible for Women&#x27;s Issues===
In late 2005, Pupatello introduced a program to assist provincial emergency workers in identifying cases of domestic abuse. She has also introduced several initiatives to assist women from low-income backgrounds in entering the job market. She introduced &quot;EqualityRules.ca&quot; in November 2006, to encourage equal relationships between young boys and girls. In the same month, she announced $2.1 million for interpreter services for victims of domestic violence.

===Minister of International Trade and Investment===
In September 2008, she was appointed the province&#x27;s Minister of International Trade and Development, which was created with the mandate of attracting new investment in Ontario.

===Minister of Economic Development and Trade===
In June 2009, she was appointed the Minister of Economic Development and Trade, a new ministry that combined three previous ministries: Small Business, International Trade and Investment and Economic Development.

In June 2011, she announced that she would not seek re-election in the October 2011 general election.

==2013 Ontario Liberal leadership bid==
On November 8, 2012, Pupatello announced that she was leaving her Bay Street job to seek the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party. She lost to Kathleen Wynne who subsequently asked her to become Minister of Finance in her first cabinet; Pupatello declined in favour of returning to the private sector.

==Hydro One==
The provincial government appointed Pupatello to the board of Hydro One, the province&#x27;s largest electricity company, in November 2013 and subsequently appointed her chair effective April 2014. She was succeeded as chair by David F. Denison on April 16, 2015, but remained on the Hydro One board of directors.

==Windsor-Essex Economic Development Corporation==
In May 2013, Pupatello was named CEO of the municipally owned Windsor-Essex Economic Development Corporation and occupied that position in addition to her old position at PricewaterhouseCoopers. She resigned in July 2015, despite having two years left in her contract, after months of criticism from some Windsor city councillors who grilled Pupatello over the WEEDC&#x27;s failure to create jobs in the region.

==Federal politics==
Pupatello supported Paul Martin&#x27;s bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. She also supported Michael Ignatieff&#x27;s bid for the party leadership in 2006.

In 2015, there was speculation that she may run for the federal Liberals in Windsor West in the October 2015 federal election and attempt to unseat NDP incumbent Brian Masse but that didn&#x27;t eventuate.

Pupatello announced in August 2019 that she was seeking the federal Liberal nomination in Windsor West in the 2019 Canadian federal election. She won the nomination and attempted to unseat incumbent New Democratic Party MP Brian Masse, coming second to him. In July 2021, Pupatello announced her intention to stand for the second time as the Liberal candidate for Windsor West in the 2021 Canadian federal election. She again placed second behind Masse who expanded his margin of victory.

<text>Nanosaur is a science fiction third-person shooter video game developed by Pangea Software and published by Ideas From the Deep for Mac OS 9 and Microsoft Windows. The player takes on the form of a Nanosaur, a genetically engineered intelligent dinosaur from the future, sent back in time just prior to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

== Story ==
In the distant year of 4122, a dinosaur species, &quot;Nanosaurs&quot;, rule the Earth. Their civilization originated from a group of human scientists who experimented with genetic engineering. Their experimentation led them to resurrect the extinct dinosaur species; however, their victory was short-lived, as a disastrous plague brought the end of their civilization itself. The few dinosaurs resurrected were lent an unusual amount of intelligence from their human creators, leaving them to expand on their growing civilization. However, as the Nanosaurs were the only species on Earth, inbreeding was the only possible choice of reproduction. This method largely affected the intelligence of the various offspring, and slowly began to pose a threat to their once-intelligent society.

The Nanosaur government offers a quest that involves time traveling into the year 65 million BC, where the five eggs of ancient dinosaur species must be retrieved and placed in a time portal leading to the present year. Their high-ranking agent, a brown &quot;Deinonychus&quot; Nanosaur, is chosen to participate in this mission. On the day of her mission, she is teleported to the past via a time machine in a Nanosaur laboratory.

The Nanosaur arrives in a lush jungle, with twenty minutes given to collect the eggs before the meteor that caused the initial extinction of the dinosaur race hits the Earth. After battling various &quot;Tyrannosaurs&quot;, the Nanosaur enters a volcanic crater, where she must cross several stone formations in a river of lava in order to retrieve the eggs. After making her way across the river, the Nanosaur detects the final eggs in a canyon oasis, where various dinosaurs, namely &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, are attempting to hinder her progress in order to protect their eggs. After evading defeat, the Nanosaur beams the final egg into the time portal, and is carried along with it back to the present.

Following the completion of the Nanosaur&#x27;s mission, the eggs are placed in nationwide laboratories, where the scientists intend on breeding them for their own purposes. Several months following this event, the eggs finally start to hatch.

== Gameplay ==
The object of the game is to collect the eggs of five dinosaur and flying reptile species and deposit them in time portals to the future in twenty minutes; at the end of the countdown, the asteroid that caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event hits Earth. The Nanosaur is equipped with a &quot;fusion blaster&quot; (a basic multi-purpose energy weapon), a jet pack allowing flight, a temporal compass for locating time portals, and a GPS locator for navigation.

The native animals will attack the Nanosaur when their eggs are threatened; species encountered include &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot;, &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; (which spits venom as in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;), and the flying reptile &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. As well as hostile creatures, the Nanosaur must also avoid environmental hazards which slow the player down or inflict damage - such as water, lava, tumbling boulders, and spores from poisonous fungi.

== Legacy ==
The game was being ported to Linux by Three Axis Interactive, but the port was never completed. Around 2003 the source code of the game was made available by the developer under a restrictive license. In 2021 an open source version of the game utilizing OpenGL was ported to modern systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux) with the developer&#x27;s blessing by Iliyas Jorio. Jorio had previously ported their other title, &quot;Bugdom&quot;, to modern systems in 2020.

&quot;Nanosaur Extreme&quot; is another version of &quot;Nanosaur&quot;, released at a later time with heftier system requirements. It has many more enemies and weapons than Nanosaur, and it is described on the Nanosaur downloads page as &quot;what Nanosaur was meant to be – a total kill-fest&quot;.
&quot;Nanosaur 2: Hatchling&quot;, a continuation of the original &quot;Nanosaur&quot; storyline, was released in March 2004. &quot;Nanosaur 2&quot; is the first stereoscopic game released for the Mac.

<doc id="1081163" wikidata="Q661772" url="?curid=1081163" title="California State Route 2">
<text>State Route 2 (SR 2) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California. It connects the Los Angeles Basin with the San Gabriel Mountains and the Victor Valley in the Mojave Desert. The highway&#x27;s southwestern end is at the intersection of Centinela Avenue at the Santa Monica-Los Angeles border and its northeastern end is at SR 138 east of Wrightwood. The SR 2 is divided into four segments, and it briefly runs concurrently with U.S. Route 101 (US 101) and Interstate 210 (I-210). The southwestern section of SR 2 runs along a segment of the east–west Santa Monica Boulevard, an old routing of US 66, to US 101 in East Hollywood; the second section runs along segments of both the north–south Alvarado Street and Glendale Boulevard in Echo Park; the third section to I-210 in Glendale is known as the north–south Glendale Freeway; and the northeastern portion from I-210 in La Cañada Flintridge to SR 138 is designated as the Angeles Crest Highway.

==Route description==
The state highway system defines Route 2 in section 302 subdivision a of the California Streets and Highways Code as follows:

Route 2 is from:
(1) The point where Santa Monica Boulevard crosses the city limits of Santa Monica at Centinela Avenue to Route 405 in Los Angeles.
(2) The point where Santa Monica Boulevard crosses the city limits of West Hollywood into the City of Los Angeles at La Brea Avenue to Route 101 in Los Angeles.
(3) Route 101 in Los Angeles to Route 210 in La Canada-Flintridge via Glendale.
(4) Route 210 in La Canada-Flintridge to Route 138 via Wrightwood.
The definition is subdivided into four sections as former portions of Route 2 have been relinquished by the state to the cities of Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and West Hollywood. In addition, section 302 subdivision c permits the state to relinquish the remaining conventional highway portions of Route 2 located on Santa Monica Boulevard, Alvarado Street and Glendale Boulevard to the City of Los Angeles. If a relinquishment under this subdivision were to take effect, the western terminus of Route 2 would be relocated to the southwestern end of the Glendale Freeway at Glendale Boulevard in the neighborhood of Echo Park.

SR 2 is known as the Angeles Crest Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway, from SR 2&#x27;s east junction with I-210 in La Cañada Flintridge to the Los Angeles–San Bernardino county line. The Big Pines Highway is routed along SR 2 from County Route N4 (CR N4, the northwest continuation of the designation) in Big Pines to the Los Angeles–San Bernardino county line.

SR 2 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and except for much of the mountain portion is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 2 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only the portion of SR 2 from a point northeast of the I-210 interchange to the San Bernardino County line is actually designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

===SR 1 to the southeast junction with US 101===
The original official southwestern terminus of SR 2 was at the junction of Lincoln Boulevard, SR 1, and I-10 in Santa Monica. SR 2 then proceeded northwest on Lincoln Boulevard before turning northeast on Santa Monica Boulevard. Since the California Legislature relinquished segments of the highway, state control of SR 2 now officially begins at the point where Santa Monica Boulevard crosses the Santa Monica–Los Angeles city limits at Centinela Avenue. From Centinela Avenue, SR 2 heads northeast on Santa Monica Boulevard, where it heads northeast through West Los Angeles, Westwood, Century City, and Beverly Hills before entering West Hollywood. Santa Monica Boulevard, as a major street, is for most of its length at least four lanes wide.
At its west end, Santa Monica Boulevard starts off Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. From there until Sepulveda Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard is a densely urban commercial street. Most of the Westside car dealerships are located on Santa Monica Boulevard. After Sepulveda, Santa Monica Boulevard passes Century City, and intersects Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills.

The south roadway of Santa Monica Boulevard, often called Little Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills, runs parallel to the state highway (north) roadway of Santa Monica Boulevard from the city&#x27;s west limit to Rexford Drive. After Rexford Drive, Little Santa Monica turns east, becoming Burton Way. Burton Way merges into San Vicente Boulevard at its intersection with La Cienega Boulevard. It is noted that the south roadway of Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills is a city street while the north roadway of Santa Monica Boulevard is a California state highway, each roadway handling bi-directional traffic.

After intersecting Wilshire, Santa Monica Boulevard continues northeast toward West Hollywood, spanning Beverly Boulevard and Melrose Avenue. At Holloway Drive, in the middle of West Hollywood, Santa Monica, now north of Melrose Avenue turns to the east. In West Hollywood, between Fairfax Avenue and Doheny Drive along Santa Monica Boulevard, bronze name plaques are embedded in the sidewalks as part of the West Hollywood Memorial Walk. SR 2 continues east through Hollywood on Santa Monica Boulevard to the Hollywood Freeway.
Route 2 then merges onto U.S. Route 101 (the Hollywood Freeway) and heads southeast leaving US 101 at the Alvarado Street exit.

===Southeast junction with US 101 to I-210===
====Alvarado Street and Glendale Boulevard====
From US 101, Route 2 heads northeast on Alvarado Street through the community of Echo Park. The route then turns north onto Glendale Boulevard.

====Glendale Freeway====

After crossing Allesandro Street, Route 2 then branches northeast onto the Glendale Freeway, a north–south route. With five lanes each direction, the freeway is quite wide. It intersects the 5 Freeway (the Golden State Freeway) and then crosses the Los Angeles River, and runs through the communities of Glassell Park and Eagle Rock.

After its interchange with the eastern Ventura Freeway (SR 134), the Glendale Freeway route follows a ridge in the San Rafael Hills through eastern Glendale. The freeway ends in the Crescenta Valley, at Foothill Boulevard in La Cañada Flintridge. Just before reaching Foothill Boulevard, SR 2 turns off the Glendale Freeway onto the eastbound Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) for a short distance until reaching the Angeles Crest Highway exit in La Cañada Flintridge.

The Glendale Freeway was originally proposed to continue through Echo Park all the way to Hollywood Freeway (101). Since that plan has been scrapped, the freeway is somewhat isolated from the remainder of the LA freeway system.

===I-210 to Route 138===

Leaving La Cañada Flintridge at an altitude of , the route turns north onto the Angeles Crest Highway. This route winds generally east-northeast through the canyons of the San Gabriel Mountains for over , before descending through Big Pines and Wrightwood to the edge of the Victor Valley approximately west of Hesperia and ending at SR 138. The highway climbs to a high point of at Dawson Saddle. The eastern portions of the Angeles Crest Highway are notoriously dangerous, with many switchbacks and blind curves, and are often closed during occasions of heavy winter snowfall. The highway is generally closed between Islip Saddle and Vincent Gap from mid-December to mid-May due to snow and rockfall.

==History==

===Designation===
In 1964, Route 2 was defined as a single route from Santa Monica to Wrightwood with no discontinuities. The segment of former US 66 on Santa Monica Boulevard west of the Hollywood Freeway and Lincoln Boulevard was added to Route 2 at this time, since US 66 was truncated to Pasadena. Route 2 became discontinuous at Routes 101 and 210 in 1965 and 1990, respectively.

Before the segment of the Glendale Freeway was built between Glendale Boulevard and just west of the Los Angeles River, Route 2 began at the Hollywood Freeway on Santa Monica Boulevard, continued east to Myra Avenue, then north on Myra Avenue, east on Fountain Avenue, northeast on Hyperion Avenue, southeast on Rowena Avenue, southeast on Glendale Boulevard, and northeast on Fletcher Drive to just west of the Los Angeles River. From west of the Los Angeles River, Route 2 continued on the Glendale Freeway to its temporary connection with Fletcher Drive at Avenue 38 and then followed the routing described in the previous paragraph to Route 138 northeast of Wrightwood.

Before the segment of the Glendale Freeway was built north of Glassell Park, Route 2 continued north on Fletcher Drive to Eagle Rock Boulevard, then north on Eagle Rock Boulevard to Verdugo Road, north on Verdugo to Cañada, north on Cañada back to Verdugo, and north and east on Verdugo to the Angeles Crest Highway (then Haskell Street).

===Beverly Hills Freeway===
Originally, it was to have been the Beverly Hills Freeway from Route 405 to Route 101 just east of Vermont Avenue, flowing onto the Glendale Freeway. In fact, the proposed freeway on Route 2 west of Route 101 was the original routing of the &quot;Santa Monica Freeway&quot; (a name which subsequently went to the distantly parallel Route 10). However, for a variety of political reasons, the department never reached agreement with Beverly Hills to build the segment through that city. At one time, the department considered building a cut-and-cover tunnel under Beverly Hills, but even this proved a non-starter, and the freeway plan west of Route 101 was quietly cancelled in 1975. Currently, the Glendale Freeway begins as a stub at Glendale Boulevard. A freeway-wide bridge was built over Glendale Boulevard in hopes that the freeway would be built further west. Today, the bridge serves as the westbound lanes of Route 2, connecting the southwestbound freeway lanes to southbound Glendale Boulevard. A more modest freeway/expressway extension to Route 101 has been discussed.

Planners originally intended for it to connect to the Hollywood Freeway with Route 101 near the Vermont Avenue interchange, but community opposition killed the project by the 1960s (which is why there is a huge median around the cancelled interchange today). The Glendale Freeway offers stunning vistas of the eastern San Fernando Valley, the Verdugo Mountains, the Crescenta Valley, and the San Gabriel Mountains.

In the 1960s, the city of Beverly Hills had begun a transition from a quasi-exurban retreat for the entertainment industry to its current status as one of the world&#x27;s premier shopping and culinary destinations. Building a freeway along Santa Monica Boulevard, the northwestern border of the city&#x27;s emergent &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; shopping district, did not fit into city fathers&#x27; vision for Beverly Hills&#x27; development. Moreover, it was feared that a freeway would exacerbate the already evident divisions between the fabulously wealthy residents of the hilly areas north of Santa Monica Boulevard and the merely affluent ones to the south. A proposed cut-and-cover tunnel for the freeway failed to generate sufficient political support, and by the mid-1970s the project was essentially dead.

California State Senator (later Congressman) Anthony Beilenson was one of the leading opponents of the project.

Caltrans&#x27; decision not to build the freeway was both harmful and beneficial to the areas along its proposed route. The massive Century City high-rise commercial development just west of the Beverly Hills city limits was built with freeway access in mind. For many Century City workers who live in Los Angeles&#x27; eastern suburbs, the quickest way home takes them through the residential district of Cheviot Hills, which has caused consternation among its well-heeled residents. For Beverly Hills, the decision helped preserve much of its emergent downtown, but at the cost of creating gridlock on Wilshire Boulevard and I-10.

===Further construction===
The first segment of freeway was built in the 1950s and ran from just west of the Los Angeles River to Avenue 38 in Glassell Park. This portion was at one time named the Allesandro Freeway, because it runs next to Allesandro Street. The last segment of freeway, from Route 134 to Route 210, was built between 1972 and 1975.

Starting in July 1964, Route 2 began in Santa Monica at its junction with Routes 1 and 10. After heading a few blocks northwest on &quot;Lincoln Boulevard&quot;, the route turned northeast on Santa Monica Boulevard, just several blocks from the Pacific Ocean. The route continued on &quot;Santa Monica Boulevard&quot; to Centinela Avenue.

For its entire length, until the tracks were removed, Santa Monica Boulevard followed the tracks of the Pacific Electric Railway. In the portion from Holloway Drive in West Hollywood to Sepulveda Boulevard in West Los Angeles, the tracks were in a separate right-of-way, with two roadways, one on each side of the tracks. For the rest of the route, the tracks ran in the traffic lanes.

Except for a short portion at its eastern end, Santa Monica Boulevard was adopted as a state highway in 1933. From 1934 to 1936, it was signed as State Route 2. Then it became U.S. Route 66. When U.S. Route 66 was truncated to Pasadena in 1964, Santa Monica Boulevard once again became State Route 2 as far east as the Hollywood Freeway. Today, the State Route 2 portion of Santa Monica Boulevard is defined from the Santa Monica/Los Angeles city limits to US 101.

From 1936 to 1964, U.S. Route 66 ran along Lincoln Boulevard from its junction with Alternate U. S. 101 (now California Route 1) and California Route 26 (now replaced by Interstate 10) to Santa Monica Boulevard and along Santa Monica Boulevard from Lincoln Boulevard to the Hollywood Freeway. US 66 turned southeast on the Hollywood Freeway with US 101. At that time, Route 2 began on Alvarado Street at the Hollywood Freeway. As is today, Route 2 traversed Alvarado Street and Glendale Boulevard to the Glendale Freeway. Route 2 continued on the Glendale Freeway to a temporary connection with Fletcher Drive at Avenue 38 in the Atwater district of Los Angeles. From the temporary connection, the route ran northeast on Fletcher Drive, and north on Verdugo Road to its south intersection with Cañada Boulevard in Glendale. From the south intersection, Route 2 headed north on Cañada Boulevard to its north intersection with Verdugo Road, north on Verdugo Road, and east on Verdugo Boulevard, before reaching Foothill Boulevard in La Canada Flintridge. Route 2 continued approximately one mile southeast on Foothill Boulevard with California Route 118 to Angeles Crest Highway. From Foothill Boulevard, Route 2 continued north on Angeles Crest Highway, where it continues to this day.

Today, the California Transportation Commission is relinquishing the street-running parts of Route 2 to local cities which it runs through. In 1996, state law was changed to permit the relinquishment of Route 2 in Santa Monica and West Hollywood. When the relinquishment in Santa Monica went through in 1998, the portion from Route 1 to Centinela Avenue was deleted. The law was changed again in 2001 to allow Route 2 from Route 405 to Moreno Drive to be relinquished to the City of Los Angeles. In 2003 California Senate Bill 315 was chaptered, acknowledging the relinquishments within Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and from Route 405 to Moreno Drive in Los Angeles, and permitting the relinquishment of Route 2 in Beverly Hills. Whether Route 2 west of Route 101 will stay as a paper route after relinquishment is yet to be determined.

Since the 1950s, proposals have been made to extend the Glendale Freeway to the Antelope Valley Freeway via a tunnel under the San Gabriels, relieving some of the latter freeway&#x27;s notorious congestion. The difficulty of designing and building such a route through the mountains (designated SR 249) and the cost of insuring it against earthquakes and terrorism would undoubtedly make perpetually cash-strapped Caltrans unable to undertake such an ambitious project.

==In popular culture==
The section of freeway between the Ventura Freeway (134) and the Foothill Freeway (210) was largely completed in late 1972, but not fully finished until late spring 1978. During this five year period, the section from just north of the 134 Ventura freeway to approximately Mountain St (Glendale College) was not built. During this time, the closed freeway and an on/off ramp at Verdugo Blvd in Montrose were used as a location for several films due to its relatively complete construction status, and its proximity to major movie studios in Southern California. Some of these productions included &quot;Coffy&quot;, &quot;Corvette Summer&quot;, &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;, &quot;Death Race 2000&quot;, &quot;Cannonball&quot;, &quot;Hardcore&quot;, and several American television series including &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot; and &quot;CHiPs&quot;. The transition overpass from the eastbound Ventura Freeway to the northbound Glendale Freeway was prominently featured in the notorious disaster film &quot;Earthquake&quot; when a livestock truck and two cars crash over the side of the overpass (a shot completed in miniature special effects). Ever since it was opened in 1978, this section of freeway is still relatively lightly traveled (especially on weekends), and is still utilized as a filming location, with filming typically done early on weekend mornings.

<doc id="1081169" wikidata="Q7043492" url="?curid=1081169" title="No. 41 Squadron RAF">
<text>No. 41 Squadron Royal Air Force is a flying squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF), currently operating as the Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) for the RAF&#x27;s Typhoon, presently based at RAF Coningsby in the English county of Lincolnshire in the United Kingdom. Its current official abbreviated title is 41 TES. The squadron was originally formed in , during First World War as part of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), and served on the Western Front as a ground attack and fighter squadron. Disbanded in 1919 as part of the post-war draw down, No. 41 Squadron was re-formed as an RAF squadron in 1923, and remained on home service until 1935, when it was deployed to Aden during the Abyssinian crisis.

During the Second World War, the squadron flew Supermarine Spitfire fighters, and saw action over Dunkirk and the during the Battle of Britain in the early years of the war. Combat operations were flown from Britain over German-occupied Europe during 1941–1944, before the squadron moved to the continent after the Normandy landings. During 1944–1945, the squadron supported the Allied advance into Germany, and it remained there until mid-1946 as part of the occupation force following the end of hostilities. In the post-war years, the squadron was disbanded and re-formed several times, operating a variety of jet aircraft in the fighter, reconnaissance, and interceptor roles. In 2006, the squadron was re-roled as the Fast Jet &amp; Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit. It remained in this role until 2010, when it became the Test and Evaluation Squadron of the Royal Air Force.

==History==
===First World War, 1916–1919===
No. 41 Squadron Royal Flying Corps was originally formed at Fort Rowner, Gosport, in mid April 1916, with a nucleus of men from 28 Squadron RFC. However, on 22 May 1916, the squadron was disbanded again when it was re-numbered &#x27;27 Reserve Squadron RFC&#x27;.

41 Squadron was re-formed on 14 July 1916 with a nucleus of men from 27 Reserve Squadron, and equipped with the Vickers F.B.5 &#x27;Gun Bus&#x27; and Airco D.H.2 &#x27;Scout&#x27;. These were replaced in early September 1916 with the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.8, and it was these aircraft which the squadron took on their deployment to France on 15 October 1916. Eighteen aircraft departed Gosport for the flight to St. Omer, but only twelve actually made it, the others landing elsewhere with technical problems. The twelve pilots spent a week at St. Omer before moving to Abeele, where the ground crews reached them by road, and the remaining six pilots by rail, minus their aircraft.

The F.E.8 was already obsolete as a pure fighter, and No. 41 used theirs mainly for ground attack. On 24 January 1917, the squadron claimed its first victories. These fell to Sergeant Pilot Cecil Tooms, who himself was killed in action only four hours later. While equipped with F.E.8s, the squadron participated in the Battle of Arras (April–May 1917) and the Battle of Messines (June 1917). By this time, the unit had become the last &#x27;pusher&#x27; fighter squadron in the RFC. In July 1917, No. 41 were re-equipped with DH 5 fighters, which proved disappointing; in October 1917, the squadron finally received S.E.5a fighters, with which they were equipped for the duration of the war.

The squadron provided distinguished service in the Battle of Cambrai (November 1917), and subsequently in the German spring offensive (March 1918), and the Battle of Amiens (August 1918). 41 Squadron claimed its final victory of the war two days prior to the cessation of hostilities. In the aftermath, the unit was reduced to a cadre of just 16 men on 7 February 1919, and returned to the United Kingdom. Their new base was Tangmere, but they were moved to Croydon, Surrey, in early October, and formally disbanded on 31 December 1919.

During the war, some seventeen aces served with No. 41 Squadron, including; William Gordon Claxton, Frederick McCall, William Ernest Shields, Eric John Stephens, Frank Soden, Russell Winnicott, Geoffrey Hilton Bowman, Roy W. Chappell, Alfred Hemming, Frank Harold Taylor, Malcolm MacLeod, Loudoun MacLean, future Air Vice-Marshal Meredith Thomas, and William Gillespie. The unit had a remarkable number of Canadian aces in it; ten out of the seventeen. The squadron&#x27;s pilots and ground crews were awarded four DSOs, six MCs, nine DFCs, two MMs, and four Mentions in Dispatches, for their World War I service with the unit. The pilots were credited with destroying 111 aircraft and 14 balloons, sending down 112 aircraft out of control, and driving down 25 aircraft and five balloons. Thirty-nine men were killed or died on active service, 48 were wounded or injured, and 20 pilots became Prisoners of War, including Australian Captain Norman Bruce Hair.

The squadron reformed at RAF Northolt on 1 April 1923, equipped with the Sopwith Snipe. In 1924, it began receiving the first Armstrong Whitworth Siskin III biplanes. On 27 July 1929, eleven aircraft from 41 Squadron flew to Calais to rendezvous with French aviation pioneer Louis Blériot and escort him back to Dover, in a re-enactment of the first crossing of the English Channel 20 years earlier. On 9 October 1930, following the R101 airship disaster in Beauvais, France, 41 Squadron pilots and ground crew formed a part of the Guard of Honour for the Lying-in-State of the 48 victims in the Palace of Westminster. Amongst the dead were the Secretary of State for Air, Brig. Gen. Lord Christopher Thomson PC CBE DSO, and the Director of Civil Aviation, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Sefton Brancker KCB AFC. Thousands filed past to pay their last respects.

During the 1930s, displays, sports, competitions, tactical exercises, and flying practice were a part of regular activity. In the summer of 1934, 41 Squadron even performed a flying display for South Bucks Mothers&#x27; Union. On 1 July 1935, 41 Squadron escorted an Imperial Airways aircraft to Brussels, with the Duke and Duchess of York on board, where they attend functions for British Week at the International Exhibition. During this period, 41 Squadron was also visited by a number of British and foreign government and military dignitaries. One of the first was Japanese General Matsui Iwane who, after World War II, was held accountable and executed for the 1937 &#x27;Rape of Nanjing&#x27;, in which his armies murdered an estimated 300,000 Chinese civilians. British dignitaries included Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, the Chief of Air Services, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Hugh Trenchard GCB DSO, the Air Officer Commanding in Chief Air Defence of Great Britain, Air Marshal Sir Edward Ellington KCB CMG CBE, and the Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area, Air Defence of Great Britain, Air Vice-Marshal Hugh Dowding, CB CMG.
In October 1935, the squadron was sent to the Aden Province with 12 Squadron and 203 Squadron, to help provide a deterrent to Italy in the region during the Abyssinian crisis of 1935–36, and to protect Aden in case of an airborne or seaborne attack by Italian forces. Although 41 Squadron visited British Somaliland once, which bordered Abyssinia, the unit was otherwise not involved in the crisis, and spent much of their time in flying training and periodic mail runs to Perim Island and Kamaran Island. On occasion, they assisted the resident unit, 8 Squadron, with air policing duties, and returned to the United Kingdom in August 1936. They were then based at RAF Catterick, Yorkshire, from September 1936, where they remained until May 1940.

In April 1937, 41 Squadron&#x27;s badge and motto, &#x27;Seek and Destroy&#x27;, are unveiled for the first time and presented to the squadron by the AOC in C, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding KCB CMG. The badge takes the form of a red double-armed cross on a white background, adapted from the arms of the French town of St. Omer, the location of the squadron&#x27;s first operational overseas posting, in October 1916.

On 30 December 1938, 41 Squadron was issued with the Supermarine Spitfire, becoming the third RAF squadron to receive them. By early February 1939, the squadron had received a full complement of twenty Mark.I Spitfires, at the cost of £129,130.

Around 200 pilots served with 41 Squadron between 1 April 1923 and 2 September 1939. During this period, no battle honours were granted, nor any decorations awarded, but the era produced ten Air Commodores, nine Air Vice-Marshals, two Air Marshals, and two Air Chief Marshals. During these same years, eleven men were killed and three injured in flying accidents, and three injured in aircrew accidents on the ground.

===Second World War, 1939–1945===

Following the declaration of war on 3 September 1939, 41 Squadron spent the first several months on monotonous routine patrols in the north of England. At the end of May 1940, the squadron flew south to RAF Hornchurch to participate in the evacuation of Dunkirk. Twelve days later, they returned to RAF Catterick, claiming six Axis aircraft destroyed and one probable, but also left behind two pilots, the squadron&#x27;s first pilot killed in action, and their first lost as a prisoner of war. After resting for a few weeks, the squadron headed south again on 26 July 1940, to participate in the first phase of the Battle of Britain. In its two-week tour, the Squadron claimed 10 Axis aircraft destroyed, four probables and three damaged, for the loss of one pilot killed and a second wounded.

Again, 41 Squadron returned north to Catterick for a few weeks rest, but returned to Hornchurch on 3 September 1940, where they remained until the end of February 1941. They were now in the thick of the Battle of Britain. The price was high, but so was the damage they inflicted on the Luftwaffe. On 5 September, the squadron experienced one of its blackest days. The Commanding Officer and OC, B Flight, were killed in action, and three other pilots were shot down and two were wounded in action; one of these was hospitalised for six months.

On 31 October 1940, the Battle of Britain was considered officially over. 49 pilots flew with the squadron between 10 July and 31 October 1940. Of these, forty-two were British, two Canadian, two Irish, and two New Zealanders. Ten were killed and twelve wounded in action (44% casualties). The squadron claimed over 100 victories from July 1940 to the end of that year.

On 23 February 1941, the squadron returned to Catterick for a well-earned break. Only four pilots remained from the original 18 who landed in Hornchurch on 3 September 1940. However, in reality it is much worse: sixteen pilots had been killed, five wounded and hospitalised (who did not return) and fifteen otherwise posted away, in effect a 200% turnover since the unit&#x27;s deployment to Hornchurch in early September. The squadron also now has its third Commanding Officer since then, and its fourth within ten months.

Following five months rest in Catterick, during which the last Battle of Britain hardened pilots departed and new recruits joined from the British Commonwealth Air Training Programme, the squadron headed south to Merston, Sussex, on 28 July 1941, to join the Tangmere Wing, where the wing leader was Douglas Bader. There followed an intensive period of offensive activity over France.

On 12 February 1942, 41 Squadron took part in the attack on the German Kriegsmarine&#x27;s , , and after they escaped from Brest and made a dash up the Channel to the safety of their home ports. During these actions, 41 Squadron claimed three German aircraft destroyed and one damaged, but lost one pilot who failed to return.

The squadron also supported the ill-fated Canadian landings at Dieppe (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August 1942, completing three squadron-strength missions over the beaches. The pilots returned from the third without the Officer Commanding, Sqn Ldr Geoffrey Hyde, who was hit by flak and killed; he was the squadron&#x27;s only casualty that day.

Tired, after a busy summer on the south coast fending off Me109s and FW190s fulfilling the Luftwaffe&#x27;s &#x27;hit and run&#x27; strategy, the squadron was taken off operations until February 1943 and sent to Llanbedr, Wales, for an extended period of rest. This heralded the start of an intensive period of turnover in the unit&#x27;s ranks, as men were rested and fresh pilots brought in.
In February 1943, the unit became the first of only two squadrons to receive the new Griffon-engine Spitfire Mk.XII. Having rested, re-equipped and trained on the new aircraft, the squadron was sent back onto operations in April 1943, and claimed their first definitive victory in over ten months on 17 April. This was also the first by the RAF in the Mk.XII Spitfire.

From late June 1943, large scale bomber escorts to targets in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, became a daily event, and Ramrod escorts to formations of between 50 and 150 B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-26 Marauders became routine.

41 Squadron provided air support in the lead-up to, and throughout the D-Day landings. On D-Day itself, 6 June 1944, three pilots were hit by flak over the bridgehead and one was killed. On 19 June, however, the squadron was pulled off air support for the bridgehead in France, and was deployed solely in the destruction of Germany&#x27;s newest weapon, the V-1 flying bomb. On 28 August 1944, the squadron claimed its last of 53 V1s destroyed during the war. Several pilots succeeded in bringing them down after expending all their ammunition, by flying alongside them and placing their own wingtips underneath that of the V1. The wind movement between both wingtips was sufficient to upset the V1&#x27;s gyroscope and send crashing it to the ground.

The squadron was re-equipped with the Spitfire Mk.XIV in September 1944, and during the ensuing three months, participated in &#x27;Big Ben&#x27; operations against V2 launch sites, in Operation Market Garden at Arnhem and Nijmegen, in operations in the Walcheren campaign, and in the Allied Oil Campaign over Germany.

The squadron moved to the continent in early December 1944, making its base at Diest in Belgium. Ground targets were the squadron&#x27;s chief prey as a member of 125 Wing, and the unit attacked anything moving on road, rail, or canal in Germany. Operating so close to the ground, flak also took its toll on pilots and aircraft. One pilot was killed, three wounded, and two shot down and taken prisoner.
In April 1945, the squadron moved forward with the advancing front, and made its first base in Germany, just south-west of the town of Celle, due west of Berlin, and only a short distance south-east of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. During April and early May 1945, German resistance crumbled. 41 Squadron claimed 33 enemy aircraft destroyed, two probably destroyed, and three damaged in the air, and 21 damaged on the ground, in the 23 days preceding 3 May 1945 (the date of the squadron&#x27;s final claim). Their own casualties for the same period were no pilots killed or wounded in action, and no aircraft lost to enemy action, although some did sustain combat damage.

After the cessation of hostilities, the squadron was based a short time at Kastrup (Copenhagen), but then returned to Germany, where it became a part of the Allied occupying forces, &#x27;BAFO&#x27;. By the end of the war, 41 Squadron had claimed 200 aircraft destroyed, 61 probably destroyed, 109 damaged, and 53 V-1s destroyed. On 31 March 1946, still based on the continent, 41 Squadron was disbanded by re-numbering to 26 Squadron.

The squadron had two mascots during the war: &#x27;Wimpy&#x27;, a Bull Terrier with the tip of one ear missing, at Catterick in 1939–40, and &#x27;Perkin&#x27;, a large black French Poodle, in 1943–44. The squadron&#x27;s 325 World War II pilots were men from Britain, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palestine, Poland, White Russia, Rhodesia, South Africa, Trinidad, Uruguay, the United States, and Zululand.

41 Squadron&#x27;s pilots were awarded three DSOs, 21 DFCs, one DFM, and one Mention in Dispatches, for their World War II service with the unit. Sixty four were killed in action or died on active service, 58 were wounded in action or injured in accidents, three were shot down but evaded capture and returned to the United Kingdom, and 21 pilots were shot down and became Prisoners of War. The average age of a man who died in service with 41 Squadron during World War II was 23½.

===Post War, 1946–2006===

On 1 April 1946, only a day after being disbanded in Germany, 41 Squadron was re-formed at RAF Dalcross in Scotland as a fighter squadron, by re-numbering from 122 Squadron, and reverted to the Supermarine Spitfire, this time the Mk. F.21.

The squadron flew its Spitfires for the last time on 18 August 1947, and became No. 41 Instrument Flying Rating Squadron, equipped with the Airspeed Oxfords &amp; North American Harvard. However, in June the following year, the squadron reverted to fighter defence and was re-equipped with the de Havilland Hornet F.1, followed later by the F.3.

41 Squadron became a day fighter unit again in January 1951 and entered the jet age, receiving its first jet-powered aircraft, the Gloster Meteor F.4. In April 1951 these were replaced by the Gloster Meteor F.8, and four years later the squadron received the Hawker Hunter F.5. On 14 July 1957, the squadron was presented with a Standard displaying the unit&#x27;s Battle Honours by the CAS, Air Marshal Sir Theodore McEvoy KCB CBE, who had served three years with 41 Squadron as a young officer, following his graduation from RAF College, Cranwell in 1925.

However, no amount of nostalgia would save the unit from the Government&#x27;s budgetary axe. On 15 January 1958, as a part of a scheme to reduce the size of RAF Fighter Command, 41 Squadron fell to the same fate as 600 and 615 Squadrons had before it, and were also disbanded. With the departure of 41 Squadron from RAF Biggin Hill ceased to be a Fighter Command airfield, its infrastructure now deemed out of date for the requirements of modern warfare. The runways had become too short for the RAF&#x27;s newest generation of aircraft and, as a result of encroaching development and civil air paths which now passed above, the base was no longer in a practical location. Fighter Command officially departed from the airfield on 1 March 1958.
This gave 41 Squadron the curious distinction of being the last fighter squadron ever to be based at Biggin Hill. The departure of the unit marked the end of an era for the station in every sense of the word, as thereafter it was relegated to non-operational status, and only used by the London University Air Squadron.

However, as with 41 Squadron&#x27;s 1946 disbanding, this, too, was a mere technicality. On 16 January 1958, just a day after being disbanded, 141 Squadron, based at RAF Coltishall, near Norwich in Norfolk, dropped the &#x27;1&#x27; at the beginning of its number and was thus reborn as 41 Squadron. In doing so, they automatically absorbed 141&#x27;s all-weather Gloster Javelin FAW.4 fighters and personnel.

41 Squadron&#x27;s standard, originally presented only six months previously, was handed over to 141 Squadron on 16 January 1958 in a short ceremony attended by Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, Air Chief Marshal Sir Thomas Pike, and by 11 Group&#x27;s Air Officer Commanding, Air Vice-Marshal Victor Bowling, himself a veteran 41 Squadron pilot from 1935.

Only remaining at Coltishall six months, the squadron moved to RAF Wattisham, near Ipswich, Suffolk, on 5 July 1958, where the Gloster Javelin FAW.4s were replaced by FAW.8s in January 1960. By this time, 56 Squadron had also joined them at the station. Whilst there, they hosted French Air Force Dassault Super Mystère fighters during President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s state visit in April 1960. 41 Squadron remained at Wattisham for approximately five-and-a-half years, before the unit was disbanded again, on 31 December 1963.

On 1 September 1965, after a 20-month break, 41 Squadron was re-formed at RAF West Raynham, near Fakenham in Norfolk, but this time as a completely different structure. The unit remained firmly on the ground as a missile defence squadron, armed with Bloodhound Mk.II surface-to-air-missile (SAM). Changes to the SAM programme, however, saw 41 Squadron disbanded yet again just five years later, on 18 September 1970. The squadron standard was moved to the Church of St. Michael and St. George at RAF West Raynham, for safe-keeping.
On 1 April 1972, at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, the squadron was reborn as a tactical fighter reconnaissance and ground attack unit within 38 Group Air Support Command. To support them in their reconnaissance role, a &#x27;Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre&#x27; or &#x27;RIC&#x27; was formed. The RIC is composed of a number of Air Transportable Reconnaissance Exploitation Laboratories (ATREL), which enable the rapid developing of photographic images and their subsequent analysis. The ATRELs can be transported by air or road, and can be deployed with the squadron to forward operating bases.

In this role, they were equipped with McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom FGR.2s, but these were soon deemed to be unsuitable for the unit. Over the ensuing years, a strategic decision was made to change the role of the RAF&#x27;s Phantoms from a fighter to an interceptor. This amendment, however, created consternation within some circles, as it was felt the squadron should maintain its role as a fighter and ground attack unit. Consequently, it was resolved to disband 41 Squadron and re-form it elsewhere to enable it to do so.

In preparation for this change, &#x27;41 Designate Squadron&#x27; was formed at RAF Coltishall, in north Norfolk, on 1 July 1976, and commenced training as a reconnaissance unit with SEPECAT Jaguar GR.1 aircraft. The two squadrons operated independently of one another until 31 March 1977, when 41 Squadron was disbanded at Coningsby. This allowed the Coltishall-based 41 Designate Squadron to drop &#x27;Designate&#x27; from their name, take possession of the standard, adopt the squadron badge, and become the new combat-ready 41 Squadron at RAF Coltishall a day later.
41 Squadron&#x27;s role changed to low-level reconnaissance and, in early 1978, it became part of SACEUR&#x27;s Strategic Reserve. In 1980, the unit was assigned to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, and was subsequently involved in exercises at Bardufoss in Norway and Decimomannu in the Mediterranean.

In support of its reconnaissance role, the unit formed a RIC at Coltishall to process and interpret the photographs made by pilots, using sensors located in a large external pod. The photographic film was taken to the MAREL&#x27;s (Mobile Aerial Reconnaissance Exploitation Laboratories) for processing and interpretation. Ideally, a mission report would have been generated within 45 minutes of &#x27;engines off&#x27;. Smaller &#x27;air-portable&#x27; RICs were also used during off-base deployments.

As a result of this ability, the squadron has been involved in a number of conflicts over two decades during the 1990s and 2000s. In early 1991, during the First Gulf War (Operation Granby, known by its American name, Desert Storm), a large number of reconnaissance and bombing missions were flown against Iraqi forces with SEPECAT Jaguar GR1 and GR1A aircraft as a part of the coalition forces.

In its aftermath, the squadron was deployed to Incirlik, in south-west Turkey, where it participated in the defence of Iraq&#x27;s Kurdish minority within the boundaries of the country&#x27;s northern no-fly zone (Operations &#x27;Warden&#x27; and &#x27;Resinate North&#x27;) until April 1993. It was during this period that the large external photographic pods were replaced with smaller, more versatile, medium level pods.
Four months later, the squadron was deployed to southern Italy, where it flew policing duties over Bosnia in support of Operation Deny Flight until August 1995. It was during this time that one of the squadron&#x27;s Jaguars became the first RAF aircraft to drop a bomb in anger over Europe since the end of World War II. The target was a Bosnian Serb tank.

The squadron returned to home Coltishall in August 1995 for a well-earned rest. Despite the vital work they had performed in Iraq and Bosnia, however, the squadron found their photographic systems were inhibited by the use of photographic film, which required special handling and processing before any results could be viewed and analysed. This drawback was compounded by the inherent difficulties of moving hardcopy prints around the battlefield, particularly with the distances involved in modern warfare. To overcome these issues, the Jaguar Replacement Reconnaissance Pod (JRRP) was introduced in August 2000.

The new system provided for the recording of a digital images by three cameras onto VHS-C super videotapes with electro optical sensors for day operations and infra-red sensors for night operations. Digital images were then analysed in the ATRELs through in a windows-based application, named &#x27;Ground Imagery Exploitation System&#x27;, or &#x27;GIES&#x27;. The GIES allowed image analysts to edit images and send them electronically.

This system was taken into battle on the Squadron&#x27;s last operational deployment, during the Second Gulf War (Operation Telic) in Iraq in March–April 2003. During the operation, they were based at Incirlik, Turkey, once again, equipped with the more up-to-date Jaguar GR3.
In July 2004, the Defence Secretary announced that 41 Squadron would be disbanded once again, on 31 March 2006, as a part of a re-organisation of the Defence Forces following a Government spending review, and the so-called Gershon efficiency study. A White Paper, titled &#x27;Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities&#x27;, foresaw the retirement of the RAF&#x27;s Jaguar aircraft two years early and the closure of RAF Coltishall. Advances in technology, it reasoned, would mean air defence could be maintained with fewer aircraft, thus allowing older equipment to be withdrawn from service earlier than originally intended. The authors planned that the RAF&#x27;s future air combat force would be based around the multi-role Typhoon and Joint Combat Aircraft, in co-operation with the Tornado GR4 and Harrier GR7/GR9. Furthermore, the paper intended to reduce Royal Air Force trained manned strength from 48,500 to 41,000 by 1 April 2008.

As a result of these decisions, all of RAF Coltishall&#x27;s squadrons would be directly affected. 16(R) (the Jaguar OCU) and 54(F) Squadrons, would be disbanded by 1 April 2005 and their aircraft disposed of, and 41 Squadron by 1 April 2006. 6 Squadron, with the last of the RAF&#x27;s Jaguars, would be moved to RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire on 1 April 2006, itself disbanded by 31 October 2007. RAF Coltishall itself would be finally closed in December 2006, thus ending an over 66 year history.

The first of these draw-downs took place on 11 March 2005, when 16 and 54 Squadrons held a combined passing-out parade. However, their disbandment had little immediate effect on the activity at Coltishall, as most Jaguar airframes and personnel were absorbed into 6 and 41 Squadrons. However, with the departure of these latter squadrons in 2006, and the subsequent closure of the base in December, the close-knit RAF community was dispersed to other locations, and a quiet returned to the area, which has not existed since May 1940.
The following senior leaders of the Royal Air Force all served with 41 Squadron at some time in their career during the Jaguar period: Sir Stephen Dalton, Sir Richard Garwood, Sir Chris Harper, Sir Jock Stirrup, Sir Charles John Thomson, and Sir Glenn Torpy.

However, despite the Government&#x27;s intention to disband 41 Squadron, and plans drawn up for final ceremonies to take place on the first weekend in April 2006, the unit was given a new lease on life only a short while before taking effect. Approval was received to move 41 Squadron to Coningsby with 6 Squadron on 1 April 2006, and to assume the role of the Fast Jet and Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit, or &#x27;FJWOEU&#x27;.

===Fast Jet &amp; Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit, 2006–2010===
The Fast Jet and Weapons Operational Evaluation Unit (FJWOEU) was formed before it assumed the 41 Squadron number plate. It was created on 1 April 2004 from the merger of the Strike Attack OEU (SAOEU), the F3 OEU, and the Air Guided Weapons OEU (AGWOEU). The FJWOEU took over 41(F) Squadron&#x27;s number plate on 1 April 2006, rescuing 41 Squadron from disbandment that would have otherwise resulted from the retirement of the RAF&#x27;s Jaguar fleet.

Their new aircraft consisted of Panavia Tornados and Harrier GR9s, and that same year, the squadron celebrated its 90th anniversary. It remained in the role of FJWOEU until 2010, during that time testing numerous weapons and defence systems that were subsequently deployed by British forces on the front line at various locations throughout the world, including Afghanistan.

===Test and Evaluation Squadron, 2010 to present===
On 1 April 2010, the Fast Jet Test Squadron (FJTS), then based at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire, was amalgamated into No. 41(Reserve) Squadron to create a new entity, 41 Squadron Test and Evaluation Squadron, or &#x27;41(R) TES&#x27;, in which form it continues today.

In September 2010, the squadron celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, holding an event at RAF Coningsby attended by families of pilots of the World War II era. The squadron applied World War II-era &#x27;EB&#x27; codes to the tail fins of its current aircraft, recognising various World War II pilots and their aircraft. Originally, some of these codes were applied to the squadron&#x27;s Harriers, but when these were retired, the codes were then applied to the Squadron&#x27;s Tornados, and subsequently Typhoons, that replaced them. They recently commemorated the following World War II aircraft:

‡ – rank indicated is final rank achieved upon leaving Royal Air Force service

Commencing the draw-down of the RAF&#x27;s Harrier force as a result of the British Government&#x27;s Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 (SDSR), 41 Squadron&#x27;s three Harrier GR9s were transferred to 1 (Fighter) Squadron at RAF Cottesmore on 4 November 2010. 41 Squadron subsequently increased its fleet of Tornado GR4s to compensate the loss of the Harriers, and only operated the GR4 until April 2013.

41 Squadron was also in the spotlight on 29 April 2011, when two of its Tornado GR4s flew with two Typhoons from RAF Coningsby in the Royal Air Force flypast down The Mall and over Buckingham Palace for the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. One of the Tornados was flown by the squadron&#x27;s then Officer Commanding, Wg Cdr Rich Davies.

In 2012, to mark the London 2012 Olympic Games, 41 Squadron unveiled special tail markings on Tornado GR4, ZA614, EB-Z, to commemorate the squadron&#x27;s link with the Olympic Games. Gp Capt Donald O. Finlay DFC AFC, who commanded the squadron from September 1940 to August 1941, had won Bronze in the Men Hurdles at the 1932 Los Angeles Games, won Silver in the same event at the 1936 Berlin Games, and read the Olympic Oath at the commencement of 1948 London Games.

The first published history of 41 Squadron, &quot;Blood, Sweat, and Valour&quot;, was launched at the Royal Air Force Club in London in December 2012, and recounts the unit&#x27;s wartime activity during the war years August 1942 to May 1945. A second volume, entitled &quot;Blood, Sweat and Courage&quot; was launched at the Royal Air Force Club in London in December 2014, and covers the preceding war years, September 1939 to July 1942.
Another major change took place on 22 April 2013, when 41 Squadron took over the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4s of fellow RAF Coningsby based No. 17(R) Test and Evaluation Squadron, which will have a new role, preparing for the introduction of the F-35B Lightning into Royal Air Force and Royal Navy service.

41 Squadron&#x27;s World War II era EB codes have been carried over onto three of their new Typhoon aircraft. They were ZJ930, coded EB-R for Sqn Ldr Hilary R. L. &#x27;Robin&#x27; Hood DFC (OC 41 Sqn 1940); ZJ947 coded EB-L for Wg Cdr Edward &#x27;Shippy&#x27; Shipman AFC (1936–1940); and ZK332, coded EB-J for Sqn Ldr George H. &#x27;Ben&#x27; Bennions DFC (1936–1940). An additional Typhoon aircraft had also joined the Squadron, prompting the need for an eighth code, and the opportunity to honour another of the Squadron&#x27;s World War II pilots. After having initially been coded EB-G for Flt Lt Eric S. &#x27;Lockie&#x27; Lock DSO DFC* MiD RAF, the honour has gone to Gp Capt Derek S. V. Rake OBE AFC &amp; Bar (1945) and Typhoon ZJ914 has been coded EB-H. 

41 Squadron celebrated its centenary in July 2016, by holding a parade and Gala Dinner at RAF Coningsby on 14 July, and a Friends and Families Open Day on 22 July. The 41 Squadron Association was also formed to coincide with the centenary.

The squadron&#x27;s Panavia Tornados were phased out in late 2017, and the last flight in this aircraft type took place on Friday 13 October 2017. 41 Squadron retains its Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4s, and continues to fly these aircraft.

All World War II-era EB codes have now been removed from the Squadron&#x27;s tailfins but one Tornado has been preserved as a gate guardian at MOD Sealand, marked EB-X, which includes the Squadron badge and Centenary (1916-2016) tail art.

==Notable pilots==

*Captain Valentine Baker MC AFC served with 41 Squadron from 1916 to June 1917, and served briefly as a Flight Commander. He left the RAF in 1922 to work for Vickers-Armstrong. In 1934, however, he formed the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company with his colleague James Martin, to design new aircraft and offer flying lessons. One of their more notable pupils was Amy Johnson. The company went on to manufacture and market four different propeller aircraft, but Baker himself was killed in a flying accident in 1942, whilst test-flying the third of these. It was his death, however, that caused his business partner to rethink safety, and develop a means of assisted escape for pilots. As a result, Martin-Baker began to manufacture ejection seats in 1946, and still does today for both fixed wing and rotary military aircraft. Amongst 80 types of aircraft into which their seats have been fitted are the Jaguar, which 41 Squadron flew from 1977–2006, the Harrier, which the squadron flew from 2006–2010, and the Tornado and Typhoon, both of which they fly today. Martin-Baker ejection seats are now being fitted into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Over 70,000 Martin-Baker ejection seats have been delivered to 93 air forces, which have saved almost 7,500 lives. It is a squadron legacy that in giving his own life, Baker has saved the lives of thousands of others.
*American Lieutenant Eugene Barksdale served with 41 Squadron from July to October 1918, during which time he claimed two victories and was wounded in action. In October 1918, he transferred to the American Expeditionary Force and returned home to become as USAAF test pilot. Clearly a talented pilot in this early era of flight, he is perhaps best known for having flown an Airco DH-4 light bomber from McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio, to Mitchel Field, which became Mitchel AFB in New York, a distance of some solely on instruments. However, in August 1926, whilst testing a Douglas O-2 observation aircraft for spin characteristics over McCook Field, he was unable to recover the aircraft and was killed. Buried with full military honours at Arlington National Cemetery, the USAF&#x27;s Barksdale Air Force Base near Bossier City, Louisiana, was named in his honour when opened in February 1933. The base is currently home to five squadrons of B52 Stratofortresses. Barksdale Street, on Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts, is also named after him.
*Canadian Squadron Leader Frederick R. G. McCall served on 41 Squadron from May to August 1918, in that time claiming 31 victories, which were in addition to a previous four claimed on 13 Sqn. His achievements on 41 were recognised with the award of a DSO and a DFC. Following the war, McCall was employed in civil aviation, and subsequently served at home as a Squadron Leader in the RCAF during World War II. He died in 1949, aged just 53, but by that time had dedicated over 30 years of his life to flying. In recognition of his service to Canadian aviation, a new airfield in Calgary was named McCall Field in his honour. That airfield is today Calgary International Airport.
*Having claimed 60 aerial victories during the First World War, Canadian Air Vice-Marshal Raymond Collishaw is considered the third-highest-scoring Allied pilot of the entire War. By his arrival on 41 Squadron in 1923 as its second peacetime Officer Commanding, he had been awarded no less than two DSOs, a military OBE, a DSC, a DFC, three MiDs, the French Croix de Guerre, and the three White Russian Orders of St. Stanislas, St. Anne, and St. Vladimir. Along with his significant victory tally, he was very much a legend in his own time. Collishaw retired in October 1943 and spent the rest of the war as a Regional Air Liaison Officer for Civil Defence UK. By the time he returned to his native Canada in 1946, he had also been awarded a CB and a civil OBE.
*Having graduated Sandhurst in 1915, Air Commodore Patrick Huskinson was seconded to the RFC later that same year, and served on 2, 4, and 19 Squadrons before the cessation of hostilities. He was credited with 11 victories, and awarded two Military Crosses. Following the war, he commanded 204 and 70 Squadrons, and then spent four years in instructing roles at Cranwell. For the following 11 years from the mid-1920s, he fulfilled armament and ordinance roles in the United Kingdom and Middle East, with the exception of a 20-month period between February 1930 and October 1931 when he commanded 41 Squadron. Returning to ordinance in March 1938, he became vice president of the Ordnance Committee at Woolwich Arsenal, and then the Director of Armament Development with the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1940, reporting to Lord Beaverbrook. In April 1941, however, Huskinson and his wife were seriously injured by Luftwaffe night-time bombing in the Blitz and Huskinson was blinded. Following nine months&#x27; convalescence, he was retired as an Air Commodore in January 1942. However, he immediately became the president of the Air Armament Board, which post he held until 1945. In this role, he was involved in the development of large bunker-busting bombs, such as the Tall Boy, and in several other technologies, despite his handicap. In 1945, he was appointed a CBE and the U.S. Legion of Merit for his work in this role. Huskinson also wrote an autobiography in 1949 called &quot;Vision Ahead&quot;, which explains his career in some detail. He also recalls his &quot;very happy years in charge of Number 41 Squadron&quot;. It was also Huskinson who wrote to the Mayor of St. Omer and obtained permission for 41 Squadron to use part of the Town Arms in its badge.
*Air Commodore Allen H. Wheeler CBE was granted a Short Service Commission in 1924, and served on 41 Squadron as a Flight Commander from September 1933 to August 1936. During this time, he was deployed to Aden with the squadron, arriving there six weeks ahead of the main group and aircraft, as a member of the advance party. From 1940 to 1944, Wheeler&#x27;s postings related to experimental aircraft and aircraft development, both with the Performance Testing Squadron at Boscombe Down and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Farnborough, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. Between February and October 1944, Wheeler was Station Commander at RAF Fairford, where he was involved in glider deployment for D-Day operations and the Arnhem landings. His contribution was recognised with the award of an OBE in the 1945 New Year&#x27;s Honours. Following further postings, including to Asia and the Mediterranean, Wheeler returned to the Aircraft &amp; Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe as it Commandant. He was appointed a CBE whilst there and retired in May 1955. Wheeler was subsequently employed as an aviation consultant and technical advisor to the film industry, and worked on such films as &quot;The Blue Max&quot; and &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot;, and was even used as a pilot in the latter movie.
*Flight Lieutenant Thomas Weston Peel Long Chaloner, The Honourable Lord Gisborough, 2nd Baron Gisborough of Cleveland, Yorkshire, was a WWI pilot and ex-Prisoner of War who returned to RAF service during World War II. He served as 41 Squadron&#x27;s Intelligence Officer for over five years of the War, and reported the squadron&#x27;s activity, victories and losses up the chain of command on a daily basis. He refused further promotion.
*Squadron Leader George Bennions was posted to 41 Squadron in February 1936. It was here that he remained for the ensuing almost five years, and he was commissioned on the Sqn in April 1940. Bennions proved to be quite a talented pilot, and he claimed his first victory over the Channel in July 1940, during the earliest salvoes of the Battle of Britain. Over the months of August and September, Bennions&#x27; tally continued to rise to the point where he had claimed ten and one shared destroyed, seven probably destroyed, and five damaged, making him the second most successful pilot on 41 Squadron during World War II. Aside from his significant victory tally during the Battle of Britain, Bennions is of interest for one of those victories, which took place on 5 September 1940. Contemporary researchers credit him with a shared victory over Oblt Franz von Werra, the Group Adjutant of JG3, who was flying an Me109E. Von Werra&#x27;s aircraft is believed to have been damaged by Bennions but finished off by 603 Squadron&#x27;s Plt Off Basil Stapleton, forcing the German pilot to crash-land near Marden, Kent. Von Werra was captured unhurt and sent to Canada, as were the majority of German POWs, to hinder their chances of escape. However, von Werra nonetheless succeeded in escaping, and returned to Germany in April 1941. So unusual was this feat that he was the only German POW to succeed in doing so during the War. Von Werra&#x27;s story was the subject of a book, and also of a film entitled &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;, which was released in 1957 and starred Hardy Krüger as von Werra.

*Pilot Officer Eric Lock joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in February 1939, and was posted to 41 Squadron as his first operational unit, in mid-June 1940. Lock&#x27;s first operational sortie took place on 9 August 1940, which was uneventful, as was his second a few days later. However, between 15 August and 17 November 1940, Lock claimed no less than 22 aircraft destroyed, and he became the most successful RAF pilot of the Battle of Britain, and the equal second highest-scoring pilot in the RAF at the time. Over the three consecutive months of September, October, and November 1940, Lock was awarded a DFC, a Bar, and a DSO. On the afternoon of 5 September 1940, 41 Squadron&#x27;s most intensive day of the Battle of Britain, Lock claimed three victories in a single sortie. The aircraft he flew that day, Spitfire Ia, N3162, EB-G, is recognised by 41 Squadron, which has the letters EB-G on one of their Typhoons, and by the BBMF, which has EB-G emblazoned on their Spitfire P7350. Lock was seriously wounded in action on 17 November 1940, and underwent multiple operations, which included three skin grafts at the hands of Dr. Archibald McIndoe at East Grinstead. Following seven months’ recuperation, he returned to operations with 611 Squadron in late June 1941. During July 1941, he added another three victories to his already impressive list, but on 3 August, he failed to return from a routine operation after attacking a German column on a road behind Boulogne. In recognition of his achievements and status in Battle of Britain history, he is remembered on several memorials and in his hometown of Bayston Hill, outside Shrewsbury, where a street is named after him. He remains today one of the RAF&#x27;s top ten Aces of World War II, credited with some 25 aircraft destroyed and 7 probably destroyed, all bar three of which he achieved on 41 Squadron.
*Group Captain Donald O. Finlay: pre-war Olympian and Officer Commanding 41 Squadron, September 1940 to August 1941. 41 Squadron honoured Finlay during the 2012 London Olympics by painting the tail-fin of one of the unit&#x27;s Tornados. Although that aircraft was recently retired, the squadron continues to honour Finlay with one of the Tornados marked up as EB-Z.
*South African Pilot Officer J. J. &#x27;Chris&#x27; Le Roux flew with 41 Squadron for a short period in late 1940 to early 1941. In July 1944, by now OC, 602 Squadron, Le Roux was credited with attacking and seriously injuring General Erwin Rommel in his staff car, on a road outside Sainte Foy de Montgomerie, in Normandy. Strafing the vehicle, the driver lost control, struck a tree and spun off the road. Rommel fractured his skull when he was thrown from the vehicle. In doing so, Le Roux single-handedly removed Germany&#x27;s commanding general from the Normandy battlefield.
*Dutch Flight Lieutenant Bram van der Stok was posted to 41 Squadron as a Fg Off in December 1941. Promoted to Actg Flt Lt and appointed OC A Flight in March 1942, he quickly claimed two victories, but was shot down over France the following month. Taken into immediate captivity, he was sent to Stalag Luft III, Sagan, where he remained until March 1944, when he took part in the mass escape of airmen that we know today as The Great Escape. All but three of the escapees were recaptured, and fifty of them were executed as retribution on Hitler&#x27;s orders. Of the three that successfully made their escapes, van der Stok was one. Acting as a Dutch labourer on forged papers, he made it back the United Kingdom in early July 1944, travelling on a route, which took him through the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, and Gibraltar. In 1963, United Artists released the film, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, based upon a book of the same name, written by Australian author Paul Brickhill in 1950. In the film, a character broadly based on van der Stok was played by James Coburn.
*Canadian Sergeant Pilot George F. Beurling was posted to 41 Squadron in April 1942, but proved too head-strong, fought with other members of the unit, and gained a reputation for doing his own thing in the air and not remaining in formation or following orders. By the following month, he was requesting a transfer to Malta and it was granted. Nonetheless, in his brief time with 41 Squadron, he claimed his first two victories. In time, he became Canada&#x27;s leading World War II ace, and was credited with 31 victories between May 1942 and December 1943. As a result, he was awarded a DSO, a DFC and two DFMs. However, he was &#x27;retired&#x27; early from the RCAF in 1944 as his skill in cockpit was matched by streak of rebelliousness, and disrespect for authority. He had a reputation for ignoring team tactics and breaking formation to attack the enemy alone, and had gained two nicknames, &#x27;Buzz Beurling&#x27; and the not-so-complimentary &#x27;Screwball Beurling&#x27;.
*Prince Emanuel Vladimirovitch Galitzine was the great-great grandson of Catherine the Great. He fled Russia with his parents and siblings in the wake of the October Revolution in 1917, and settled in England, where he was educated. Galitzine joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve on a Short Service Commission in late 1938, but left again to go to Finland in early 1940 to fight the Soviets attempting to occupy the country. Returning to London again in October 1940, after his mother was killed in the Blitz, Galitzine rejoined the RAFVR, but had to do so as an aircraftsman, though he was recommissioned in September 1941. Galitzine saw operational service in several squadrons before joining 41 Squadron as a Fg Off in May 1943, and he claimed a probably destroyed enemy aircraft with the unit in October. Following his tenure with the squadron, he was rested as personal assistant to Air Vice-Marshal Sir William Dickson, then commanding 83 Group, which was preparing for the Normandy invasion. When Dickson was posted to Italy, Galitzine accompanied him, adding Italian to an already impressive list of languages he spoke. Following the War, Galitzine worked in the civil aviation industry, but maintained links with Russia and, in 1998, attended the reburial and funeral service of the murdered Tsar and his family in St Petersburg.
*Flying Officer Peter Gibbs was a generally unassuming character who served with 41 Squadron between January 1944 and March 1945. He was an active pilot during his tour, and an avid musician. He became a professional musician after he left the RAF in August 1945, and joined the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1954. Within two years, he had joined the London Symphony Orchestra and during this time became (in)famous for a dressing down he gave to one of the century&#x27;s most celebrated performing artists, Herbert von Karajan. The orchestra felt von Karajan had been unprofessional when conducting smaller, &#x27;less important&#x27; concerts during a tour of the United States in 1956. He had often just bowed once and left the stage at the end of concerts, refusing to return for encores, despite the applause from the audience. The orchestra was slighted by this behaviour, and eventually had had enough. The last straw came when von Karajan left the stage in Boston after the last note was played, neither waiting for applause nor calls for an encore. The orchestra, in which Gibbs was playing first violin, was upset by this apparent insult to both them and the audience, but turned up nonetheless on time for an early rehearsal the following morning. Von Karajan, however, came in late, much to the disgruntlement of the orchestra. When he finally arrived, Peter Gibbs, an impromptu, self-appointed spokesman, stood up and addressed him directly, demanding an apology. He rebuked von Karajan, stating, &quot;I did not spend four years of my life fighting bastards like you to be insulted before our own allies as you did last evening&quot;. Von Karajan ignored him completely and continued conducting as if nothing had happened. That night, however, during a concert, von Karajan chose his moment and, during the interval, refused to go back on stage until a letter was signed stating that Gibbs be immediately sacked. The orchestra&#x27;s managers had little choice but to bow to the demand. Although Gibbs was never to play with the Philharmonia again after this incident, it is understood that von Karajan also never conducted the Philharmonia again after the tour either, and it is said that he vowed to never conduct an English orchestra again. All this time, Gibbs also flew privately. He had joined the Surrey Flying Club in June 1957, and then flew more-or-less continuously for the next 18 years. Gibbs bought himself a Tiger Moth and enjoyed peacetime flying. However, flying was also what brought about his premature death in December 1975. He took off for a brief flight in a Cessna from Glenforsa Airfield on the Isle of Mull in Scotland on Christmas Eve 1975, but failed to return. A search was mounted but no trace whatsoever could be found of him. Oddly, his body was found four months after his disappearance part way up a hill, approximately one mile from Glenforsa Airfield, without his aircraft, showing the signs of having lain there all that time. The original search for Gibbs had passed through the area at the time he had gone missing, but nothing had been seen. His body gave away no clues as to his cause of death. Gibbs&#x27; missing Cessna bewildered officials and his case soon became known as the &#x27;Great Mull Air Mystery&#x27;. It was not until September 1986; almost 11 years after Gibbs&#x27; death, that his aircraft was located in the sea off Oban. The aircraft&#x27;s remains also gave up no clue as to the reason it was there. It can only be assumed that Gibbs, for some reason, came down in the sea and that he had managed to free himself and swim ashore. It is thought he then tried to make his way back to the airfield, around a mile away, but, considering the time of year, location, and likely temperatures of both the water and air, probably succumbed to the effects of exposure.

*Palestinian Sergeant Pilot Aharon Remez was posted to his first and only operational unit, 41 Squadron, in April 1945, and served with the unit until March 1946, and was not commissioned in the RAF. Based in Germany during the last weeks of the war and beyond, he witnessed Nazi atrocities first hand, and often lent a personal hand. The officers of 41 Squadron turned a blind eye, and he was given special leave to allow him to be able to do so. This enabled him to commence assisted passage for many holocaust survivors to the Middle East. Remez left the RAF in 1946 and returned home to champion the formation of a Jewish State. This occurred in May 1948, and in July he was given the post of Brigadier General and the founder and first Commanding Officer of the Israeli Air Force. He held this post until December 1950. Remez was subsequently the Head of Purchasing Delegation, Israeli MOD mission to the United States, the Israeli Defence Minister&#x27;s Aide for Aviation, a member of the House Committee &amp; Foreign Affairs &amp; Defence Committees of the 3rd Knesset, Director of the Dept for International Co-operation in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Director General of the Israeli Ports Authority, and Chairman of the Israeli Aviation Authority. Remez was also the Israeli Ambassador to the United Kingdom from May 1965 to July 1970, and often met up with his former 41 Squadron colleagues from 1945 whilst based there.
*Squadron Leader Terry Spencer was originally commissioned with the Royal Engineers in December 1939, he transferred to the RAFVR as a Plt Off in October 1941. Following training, he was posted to 26 Squadron at Gatwick in November 1942, and remained with this unit until February 1944, in that time being promoted to Flt Lt, and he left the unit as a Flight Commander. Following a brief posting to 165 Squadron, Spencer was posted to 41 Squadron as OC A Flt at the beginning of May 1944. Arriving just prior to D-Day, he led the Squadron on a number of operations in advance support of the invasion, and then led the unit on anti-diver operations from June 1944, when the V1 Doodlebug menace commenced. Within four months, he had become a V1 Ace, with seven shot down, and also claimed a destroyed German fighter, thereby ending the career of a 171-victory Luftwaffe Ace Emil &#x27;Bully&#x27; Lang. Spencer was posted to 350 Squadron within the same Wing to take command on 4 January 1945. On 26 February, however, he was hit by flak over Germany and captured. A month later, he escaped from camp by bicycle, and subsequently motorcycle, with another former 41 Sqn pilot, Sqn Ldr Keith &#x27;Jimmy&#x27; Thiele, in a Steve-McQueen-style getaway, in which the pair made it back to Allied lines. Spencer returned to 350 Squadron, where he once again took over command on 2 April 1945. Only 17 days later, he was shot down once again, this time over Wismar Bay, in northern Germany. Blown out of his cockpit, the force deployed his parachute at a height of just 30–40 feet, which he miraculously survived, only to be captured again. The successful jump has since been credited by the Guinness Book of Records as having been the lowest authenticated survived bale-out on record. Spencer was injured and hospitalised, but liberated by advancing Allied armies approximately two weeks later. He was awarded an immediate DFC for his exploits. In 1947, he was also awarded the Territorial Efficiency Medal and the Belgian Croix de Guerre with Palm. Spencer was demobbed in December 1945 and headed to South Africa in spring 1946, taking three weeks to fly himself there in a single-engined Percival Proctor. He was employed there as the personal pilot of Ben du Preez, Managing Director of Kimlite Industries, which was a cover for illicit diamond buying. Spencer then returned to the United Kingdom where he met the actress Lesley Brook, who starred in at least 24 films between 1937 and 1948. They married in August 1947, and resided for a time on the Isle of Wight, before returning to South Africa in July 1948. On this occasion, he launched a new career by founding the aerial photography company in October that same year. The company enjoyed some success, but he was to become a more successful freelance photographer for LIFE Magazine, for whom he worked between September 1952 and September 1972. During his time with LIFE, he covered several conflicts, including Biafra, Congo, and the Vietnam War, and spent three months on tour with a then little-known band called The Beatles. When LIFE folded in 1972, Spencer moved to People magazine, where he spent the ensuing 20 years. He authored and published two books, the first a renowned coffee table book about The Beatles (&quot;It was Thirty Years Ago Today&quot;), and the second an autobiography (&quot;Living Dangerously&quot;), which he co-authored with his wife. Following his death in February 2009, The Times published a glowing obituary of a man who was a real-life adventurer, and whose life and exploits were the very stuff of &#x27;boys own&#x27; magazines.

<text>Number 54 Squadron (sometimes written as No. LIV Squadron) is a squadron of the Royal Air Force based at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. On 1 September 2005, it took on the role of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Operational Conversion Unit, and is now the Advanced Air ISTAR Academy, responsible for training all RAF crews assigned to the MQ-9A Reaper, Protector RG1 (MQ-9B), Shadow R1/R2, RC-135W Rivet Joint and Poseidon MRA1. It also controls the RAF ISR Warfare School (ISRWS) who run the Qualified Weapons Instructor Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (QWI ISR) and QWI Reaper Courses. 

The squadron was previously a SEPECAT Jaguar strike fighter unit, based at RAF Coltishall, Norfolk, from April 1974 until it was disbanded on 11 March 2005.

==History==
===World War I===
No. 54 Squadron was formed at Castle Bromwich on 5 May 1916. Like many others formed at the same time, was tasked with Home Defence duties flying BE2Cs and Avro 504s. Four months later, however, it re-equipped with Sopwith Pups, being the first Royal Flying Corps Squadron to operate the Pup. It moved to France as a day fighter squadron in December 1916. It was initially used as for bomber escort, claiming its first kill, an Albatros D.III, in April 1917, but specialised in attacking enemy observation balloons during the Battle of Arras.

The Pup soon became outclassed in air combat, however, and No. 54 concentrated on ground attack missions until it could re-equip with Sopwith Camels in December 1917, allowing to return to fighter duties, providing protection for Army co-operation squadrons. The German spring offensive saw a return to low level attack missions, carrying out both ground attack and fighter missions until the end of the War. In February 1919, the Squadron returned to RAF Yatesbury, reduced to cadre status and was disbanded on 25 October 1919.

===Between the wars===
The Squadron was reformed at RAF Hornchurch on 15 January 1930 as a fighter squadron equipped initially with dual-control Siskin Trainers until Bristol Bulldog fighters were received in April that year. The squadron had a brief stay at RAF Upavon in 1931, prior to returning to RAF Hornchurch. The Bulldogs were replaced by Gloster Gauntlets, in September 1936 and Gladiators in April 1937, before the Squadron&#x27;s first monoplane, the Supermarine Spitfire, arrived in March 1939.

===World War II===
The early days of World War II were spent patrolling the Kent coast until, in May 1940, the unit provided air cover for the evacuation of Dunkirk, claiming 31 aircraft shot down for the loss of 4 pilots and seven Spitfires.

From July, the Squadron was heavily engaged in the Battle of Britain, often using RAF Manston as a forward operating base. The fighting was intense, and losses were heavy, with the Squadron being withdrawn to RAF Catterick on 2 September 1940. One notable pilot during the first year of the year was &quot;Al&quot; Deere, who claimed 11 German aircraft shot down, while himself being shot down 7 times.

No. 54 Squadron returned to Hornchurch in February 1941, flying fighter sweeps and bomber escort missions over Northern France until November 1941, when it moved north to RAF Castletown, Caithness, undertaking coastal patrols over the Pentland Firth. In June 1942, the squadron was moved to RAF Wellingore, to prepare for moving to Australia.

In mid-1942, the squadron joined No. 1 Wing (Spitfire Wing) of the Royal Australian Air Force, a Spitfire unit responsible for air defence duties against Japanese aircraft in the Darwin area. No. 54 Squadron arrived at RAAF Station Darwin on 17 January. Initially, the wing as a whole suffered from the inexperience of its pilots and mechanical problems caused during the shipment of Spitfires. Although contact with the Japanese was generally brief, 54 Squadron pilots scored a number of kills. Following the end of the war, the squadron disbanded in Melbourne on 31 October 1945.

===Post World War II===
On 15 November 1945 No. 183 Squadron RAF, a Hawker Tempest ground-attack unit based at RAF Chilbolton near Oxford, was renumbered to No. 54 Squadron and spent a year training pilots destined for overseas service before receiving Vampires and moving to RAF Odiham on 22 November 1947.

In 1948, six Vampires from the Squadron made history when they completed the first crossing of the Atlantic by jet aircraft. Flying in 3 legs with over 8 hours in the air and accompanied by ground crew in Avro Yorks Following a three-year stint with Meteors, which arrived in April 1952, Hunters arrived in March 1955, and the Squadron took up fighter duties with Hunter Mk 4s in September 1955. Reequipped with Mk 6s as part of No 38 Group, frequently deploying to trouble spots around the world as part of the Group&#x27;s Offensive Strike Wing. The Squadron was the first jet RAF formation team to trail smoke with a team of six Vampires. 

In 1955, No 54 Squadron flew a formation of four Hawker Hunter F1 aircraft. The following year the Squadron team adopted the name &quot;The Black Knights&quot; – the pilots wore black flying suits. They re-equipped to Mk9s gradually as the squadron relocated from RAF Odiham to RAF Stradishall in July 1959 with Hunter Mk9s and to RAF West Raynham, Norfolk, in 1963.

The squadron was briefly disbanded on 1 September 1969, however was reformed the same day after being re-equipped with McDonnell-Douglas Phantoms at RAF Coningsby in 1969.

By 1974 when twelve SEPECAT Jaguar aircraft were delivered the squadron had re-located to RAF Coltishall. From 1975 until at least 1994 (the last year for which data is available) the squadron&#x27;s wartime role was as an operational squadron in the front line assigned to SACEUR with twelve Jaguar aircraft, eight WE.177 tactical nuclear bombs, and a variety of conventional weapons. In a high-intensity European war the unit&#x27;s role was to support land forces on the Continent resisting an assault by the Red Army on Western Europe, first with conventional weapons and secondly with tactical nuclear weapons, should a conflict escalate to that stage, by striking beyond the forward edge of the battlefield into enemy-held areas. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that with some aircraft held back from the conventional phase as a reserve, there would be one-third attrition of aircraft, leaving the remaining survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the squadron&#x27;s entire stockpile of eight nuclear bombs.

===Post Cold War===

The squadron moved to RAF Coltishall in 1974 and, following the retirement of the WE.177 nuclear weapon in the late 1990s, took on a more expeditionary footing with a number of operational deployments including flights over Northern Iraq from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey and flights over the Balkans from Gioia del Colle Air Base in Italy. With the decision taken to run the Jaguar fleet down in anticipation of the arrival of its replacement, the Typhoon, No 54 Squadron was disbanded at RAF Coltishall on 11 March 2005.

===2005 - 2021: ISR Operational Conversion Unit (OCU)===
Reformed as No. 54 (Reserve) Squadron at RAF Waddington on 1 September 2005 it re-roled as the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) OCU, responsible for training all mission crews for the E-3D Sentry AEW1, the Nimrod R1, Sentinel R.1, Shadow R1 and later the MQ-9A Reaper.

From 2010, 54(R) Squadron became the home of the ISR Warfare School who are responsible for the delivery of the Qualified Weapons Instructor Course for ISR (QWI ISR).

Since 2013, 54 Sqn has also trained crews for the newly acquired RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft. 

The squadron was formally titled No. 54 (Reserve) Squadron up until 2018, when the (Reserve) suffix was removed from all training squadrons.

On 31 October 2019, crew from No. 54 Squadron ferried the first RAF Boeing Poseidon MRA.1 &quot;ZP801&quot; from the Boeing Renton Factory, Seattle, to NAS Jacksonville, Florida. Since October 2020, the squadron operates a detachment at RAF Lossiemouth, Moray, in order to act as the OCU for the Poseidon MRA.1.

=== Since 2021: Advanced Air ISTAR Academy ===
In June 2021 Defence Secretary Ben Wallace established a new Advanced Air ISTAR Academy run by 54 Squadron as &#x27;a national and international centre of excellence for remotely piloted air systems and for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance&#x27;. In this capacity 54 Squadron continues to deliver OCU training for the RAF ISTAR Force as a Central Flying School (CFS) Approved Training Organisation (ATO).

In May 2023, 54 Squadron began training crew for the Protector RG1 in cooperation with the manufacturer, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, at Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota.

Bolt was born in Adelaide, his parents being newly-arrived Dutch immigrants. He spent his childhood in remote rural areas, including Tarcoola, South Australia, while his father worked as a school teacher and principal. After completing secondary school at Murray Bridge High School, Bolt travelled and worked overseas before returning to Australia and beginning an arts degree at the University of Adelaide. Dropping out of university he took up a cadetship with &quot;The Age&quot;, a Melbourne broadsheet newspaper. His roles at &quot;The Age&quot; included sports writer, prior to joining &quot;The Herald&quot;. His time as a reporter included a period as the newspaper&#x27;s Asia correspondent, based first in Hong Kong and later in Bangkok. He worked for the Hawke government on two election campaigns.

==Media career==

Bolt has had various roles on numerous TV networks, radio stations and in the print media.

In 2005, Bolt released a compilation of newspaper columns in a book entitled &quot;Still Not Sorry: The Best of Andrew Bolt&quot;.

===Print===
Bolt&#x27;s column and articles are published by News Corp Australia in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; and his column is published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Advertiser&quot; in Adelaide, &quot;Northern Territory News&quot; and &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;.

===Internet===
In May 2005, Bolt established a web-only forum in which readers could offer comments, feedback and questions in response to his columns. He posted some of these comments on the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; website. The forum changed to a more conventional blog format in July 2006.

===Radio===
Bolt co-hosted a daily radio show, &quot;Breakfast with Steve Price and Andrew Bolt&quot;, on the former MTR 1377.

He appeared weekly on radio station 2GB in Sydney for &quot;The Clash&quot; with union leader Paul Howes and as of 2016 is a regular guest four nights a week on &quot;Nights with Steve Price&quot;, which is broadcast on 2GB and Melbourne″s 3AW, 4BC Brisbane and network stations across Australia.

===Television===
From 2001 to 2011, he was a regular guest on &quot;Insiders&quot;.

Bolt left &quot;Insiders&quot; in May 2011 to host his own weekly program, &quot;The Bolt Report&quot;, on Network Ten. &quot;The Bolt Report&quot; ended on Ten in 2015 and, in 2016, Bolt became a contributor to Sky News Live. &quot;The Bolt Report&quot; subsequently resumed on Sky News Live in May 2016 as a nightly format.

He has also appeared on the ABC television show &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; and ABC Radio National&#x27;s &quot;Late Night Live with Phillip Adams&quot;.

==Controversies, court actions and findings==

===Leak of intelligence document===
In June 2003, Bolt published an article criticising Andrew Wilkie in which he quoted from a classified intelligence document written by Wilkie as an intelligence analyst for the Office of National Assessments. It was claimed, but never proven, that someone in Foreign Minister Alexander Downer&#x27;s office had leaked the document to Bolt. A spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police said that they did not have any evidence to identify the culprit.

===Stolen Generations===
Bolt has frequently clashed with Robert Manne, Professor of Politics at La Trobe University, about the Stolen Generation. Bolt has said that there were no large-scale removals of children &quot;for purely racist reasons&quot;. After Bolt challenged Manne to &quot;name just 10&quot; children stolen for racial reasons, Manne replied with 50 names, which Bolt in response said included children rescued from sexual abuse and removed for other humanitarian reasons. Manne argued that Bolt and others were engaged in historical denialism despite &quot;a mountain of documentary evidence and eyewitness testimony&quot;. Bolt noted many instances of contemporary Aboriginal children being left &quot;in grave danger that we would not tolerate for children of any other race because we are so terrified of the &#x27;stolen generations&#x27; myth.&quot;

Bolt has questioned the very existence of the Stolen Generation. Bolt stated that it is a &quot;preposterous and obscene&quot; myth and that there was actually no policy in any state or territory at any time for the systematic removal of &quot;half-caste&quot; Aboriginal children. Robert Manne responded that Bolt did not address the documentary evidence demonstrating the existence of the Stolen Generations and that this is a clear case of historical denialism. Bolt then challenged Manne to produce ten cases in which the evidence justified the claim that children were &quot;stolen&quot; as opposed to having been removed for reasons such as neglect, abuse, abandonment, etc. He argued that Manne did not respond and that this was an indication of unreliability of the claim that there was policy of systematic removal. In reply, Manne stated that he supplied a documented list of 250 names. Bolt stated that, prior to a debate, Manne provided him with a list of 12 names that he was able to show during the debate was &quot;a list of people abandoned, saved from abuse or voluntarily given up by their parents&quot;; and that during the actual debate, Manne produced a list of 250 names without any details or documentation as to their circumstances. Bolt also stated that he was subsequently able to identify and ascertain the history of some of those on the list and was unable to find a case where there was evidence to justify the term &quot;stolen&quot;. He stated that one of the names on the list of allegedly stolen children was 13-year-old Dolly, taken into state care after being &quot;found seven months pregnant and penniless, working for nothing on a station&quot;.

The Bolt/Manne debate is an example of the adversarial arguments on the issue. There is focus on individual examples as evidence for or against the existence of a policy, and little or no analysis of other documentary evidence such as legislative databases showing how the legal basis for removal varied over time and between jurisdictions, or testimony from those who were called on to implement the policies, which was also recorded in the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report. A 2008 review of legal cases claims it is difficult for Stolen Generation claimants to challenge what was written about their situation at the time of removal.

===Defamation case===
In 2002, magistrate Jelena Popovic was awarded $246,000 damages for defamation after suing Bolt and the publishers of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; over a 13 December 2000 column in which he claimed that she had &quot;hugged two drug traffickers she let walk free&quot;. Popovic stated that she had in fact shaken their hands to congratulate them on having completed a rehabilitation program. The jury found that what Bolt wrote was untrue, unfair and inaccurate, but cleared him of malice.

Bolt emerged from the Supreme Court of Victoria after the jury verdict, stating that his column had been accurate and that the mixed verdict was a victory for free speech. His statement outside the court was harshly criticised by Supreme Court Justice Bernard Bongiorno, who later overturned the jury&#x27;s decision, ruling that Bolt had not acted reasonably because he did not seek a response from Popovic before writing the article and, in evidence given during the trial, showed he did not care whether or not the article was defamatory. Justice Bongiorno ordered that Popovic be awarded $210,000 in aggravated compensatory damages, $25,000 in punitive damages and $11,500 interest. The judge stated that the damages awarded were significantly influenced by Bolt&#x27;s &quot;disingenuous&quot; comments he had made outside court and the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;&#x27;s reporting of the jury&#x27;s decision. The Court of Appeal later reversed the $25,000 punitive damages, though it upheld the defamation finding, describing Bolt&#x27;s conduct as &quot;at worst, dishonest and misleading and at best, grossly careless&quot;.

===Racial discrimination case===

In September 2010, nine individuals commenced legal proceedings in the Federal Court against Bolt and the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; over two posts on Bolt&#x27;s blog. The nine sued over posts titled &quot;It&#x27;s so hip to be black&quot;, &quot;White is the New Black&quot; and &quot;White Fellas in the Black&quot;. The articles suggested it was fashionable for &quot;fair-skinned people&quot; of diverse ancestry to choose Aboriginal racial identity for the purposes of political and career clout. The applicants claimed the posts breached the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot;. They sought an apology, legal costs, and a gag on republishing the articles and blogs, and &quot;other relief as the court deems fit&quot;. They did not seek damages.
On 28 September 2011, Justice Mordecai Bromberg found Bolt to have contravened section 18C of the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act&quot;.

The case was controversial. Bolt described the decision as a &quot;terrible day for free speech&quot; in Australia and said it represented &quot;a restriction on the freedom of all Australians to discuss multiculturalism and how people identify themselves. I argued then and I argue now that we should not insist on the differences between us but focus instead on what unites us as human beings.&quot; Jonathan Holmes of the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; described Justice Bromberg&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act&quot;, and his application of it to Bolt&#x27;s columns as &quot;profoundly disturbing&quot; because it reinforced concerns that 18C creates &quot;one particular area of public life where speech is regulated by tests that simply don&#x27;t apply anywhere else, and in which judges - never, for all their pontifications, friends of free speech - get to do the regulating.&quot; Bolt later commented that he believed Justice Bromberg&#x27;s failed attempt to run for the Labor Party ten years prior had a role in the final decision.

===Assault===
On 6 June 2017, Bolt was assaulted in Lygon Street, Melbourne by two masked men, while a third apparently filmed the attack. Melbourne Antifa, a self described &quot;anti-fascism&quot; activist group, appeared to claim a connection in the incident on Facebook, posting that Bolt attacked &quot;some of our family in solidarity ... while they were protesting today&quot;. Video footage of the assault on Bolt was described as &#x27;alarming&#x27;, with Bolt saying he was &quot;sick of being targeted for his conservative beliefs and would pursue his attackers for justice and demand a charitable donation&quot;.

===Immigration===

Bolt has spoken out against the changing racial demographics of Australia. In August 2018, Bolt wrote an article titled &quot;Tidal wave of new tribes dividing us&quot; in which he argues that a &quot;tidal wave&quot; of migrants are swamping Australia, forming enclaves and &quot;changing our culture&quot;. He also said &quot;Immigration is becoming colonisation, turning this country from a home into a hotel.&quot; This article prompted a press council complaint. Bolt has also spoken approvingly of Jean Raspail&#x27;s book &quot;The Camp of the Saints&quot;, a novel depicting Europe being swamped by Asian immigrants.

===Defence of George Pell===
In 2019, Bolt defended Cardinal George Pell, who at that time had been convicted of child sexual abuse (he was later acquitted by the High Court), saying that &quot;I am not a Catholic or even a Christian. He is a scapegoat, not a child abuser.&quot; He also stated that &quot;In my opinion, this is our own OJ Simpson case, but in reverse. A man was found guilty not on the facts but on prejudice. ... Cardinal George Pell has been falsely convicted of sexually abusing two boys in their early teens. That&#x27;s my opinion, based on the evidence.&quot; He went on to say that the successful prosecutions case was &quot;flimsy&quot; and that the conviction was the result of a &quot;vicious&quot; smear that formed part of a &quot;sinister&quot; campaign against the cardinal, adding that Pell was being made to &quot;pay for the sins made by his church&quot;. Bolt reiterated his support for Pell when the appeal against Pell&#x27;s conviction was dismissed in Victoria&#x27;s Court of Appeal. On 7 April 2020, the High Court of Australia quashed Pell&#x27;s convictions and determined that verdicts of acquittal be entered in place of all previous verdicts.

On 14 April 2020, Bolt interviewed George Pell on Sky News Australia following his acquittal by the High Court. During the interview, Bolt asked Pell if he felt ashamed of the way the Catholic church dealt with the ongoing sex abuse crisis. Pell replied that he did and described the crisis as a &quot;cancer&quot;, also stating that failures for the church to act still haunted him. Pell said he didn&#x27;t commit the alleged Melbourne sex abuse and didn&#x27;t know why the accuser testified against him. He suggested the accuser may have been &#x27;used&#x27;.

===Comments regarding Greta Thunberg===
In July 2019, Bolt made comments about Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg in which he questioned the legitimacy of her views on climate breakdown due to Thunberg&#x27;s autism. &quot;I have never seen a girl so young and with so many mental disorders treated by so many adults as a guru&quot;, wrote Bolt. He went on to question why such leaders &quot;treat a young and strange girl with such awe and even rapture&quot;. The comments were widely seen as ignorant. Later in the article, Bolt went on to describe Thunberg&#x27;s younger sister as displaying &quot;a spectacular range of mental issues&quot;. Thunberg responded to the article on Twitter, saying &quot;I am indeed &#x27;deeply disturbed&#x27; about the fact that these hate and conspiracy campaigns are allowed to go on and on and on just because we children communicate and act on the science. Where are the adults?&quot;

===Comments regarding Bruce Pascoe===
Author Bruce Pascoe grew up thinking he was British. In his 30s he came to believe that he also has Australian Aboriginal heritage and identified himself as Koori. Bolt objected to this apparent change in Pascoe&#x27;s heritage following the success of &quot;Dark Emu&quot;, a book written by Pascoe in 2014 that reexamines colonial accounts of Aboriginal people in Australia, and cites evidence of pre-colonial agriculture, engineering and building construction by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Bolt suggested on his blog that Pascoe had succumbed to &quot;the romance of the Noble Savage… the thrill of the superstitious&quot;.

In an earlier article in the &quot;Griffith Review&quot; (2012, following &quot;Eatock v Bolt&quot;) titled &quot;Andrew Bolt&#x27;s Disappointment&quot; (also reproduced in &quot;Salt: Selected Stories and Essays&quot;), Pascoe had suggested that he and Bolt could &quot;have a yarn&quot; together, without rancour, because &quot;I think it&#x27;s reasonable for Australia to know if people of pale skin identifying as Aborigines are fair dinkum&quot;. He described how and why his Aboriginal ancestry – and that of many others – had allegedly been buried.

In early 2020, the feud escalated when Bolt published a letter provided to him by Josephine Cashman, which resulted in Cashman being dismissed from the Federal Government&#x27;s Indigenous voice to government&#x27;s Senior Advisory Group. In the blog post, Bolt said the letter had been written by a Yolngu elder, denouncing Pascoe and &quot;Dark Emu&quot;. However the elder asserted that he had not written the letter, and it was also found to have paragraphs lifted from other sources.

In 2021, Nyunggai Warren Mundine, stated that genealogists &quot;have produced research that all Pascoe’s ancestry can be traced to England. Pascoe has not addressed this and has been persistently vague about who his Aboriginal ancestors are and where they came from.&quot; Historian Geoffrey Blainey stated that &quot;it is now known that [Pascoe&#x27;s] four grandparents were of English descent&quot;.

===Child sexual grooming comments===
Bolt was widely condemned by child protection advocates who stated that he had minimised the seriousness of child sexual grooming during a segment on his Sky News show on 18 February 2020. Bolt repeatedly used the phrase &quot;hit on&quot; to describe the sexual grooming of a year 9 school boy by his athletics coach at St Kevin&#x27;s College, Melbourne. 
Child welfare advocate Katrina Lines said &quot;There is no consensual social situation in which it would be OK for an adult to &#x27;hit on&#x27; a child. The adult was grooming the child and building an emotional connection so they could do what they wanted to him&quot;. The abused school boy later stated that Bolt and Gerard Henderson&#x27;s comments made him feel &quot;sick&quot; and accused the pair of &quot;trivialising&quot; the assaults. Bolt and Henderson apologised for their comments in the subsequent days.

===Climate change===
In 2021, Bolt opposed the News Corp campaign to publicise the effects of climate change as &#x27;rubbish&#x27;. Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive, Kelly O&#x27;Shanassy, commented that Bolt has &quot;no credibility&quot; on climate change.

<text>Bo Göran Hägglund (born 27 January 1959) is a Swedish politician of the Christian Democrats. He was the leader of the Christian Democrats from 2004 to 2015, Member of the Riksdag from 1991 to 2015, and served as Minister for Social Affairs from 2006 to 2014.

==Early life and political career==
Hägglund&#x27;s parents are originally from Finland: they moved to Sweden in the 1950s. He was born in Degerfors in central Sweden, but moved to Jönköping, a Christian Democratic stronghold, with his family in 1978.

He started his political career in the Christian Democratic youth organisation. From 1978 he was employed by the party, first as ombudsman for the local Christian Democratic Youth, and from 1981 for the regional party branch. From 1982 to 1986 he was also a member of the Municipal Council in Jönköping.

Following the 1985 elections, he began work as parliamentary secretary for the Christian Democrats. He temporarily left politics in 1988, to start working for an insurance company. In the parliamentary elections of 1991 he was elected a Member of Parliament.

Hägglund became the Riksdag&#x27;s Father of the House on 1 January 2015, being the eldest among those first elected in 1991.

=== Party leader ===
Hägglund was generally considered to be long-time party leader Alf Svensson&#x27;s personal favourite as a successor. However, when Svensson announced his plans to step down, two other candidates, Maria Larsson and Mats Odell, had the support of a greater number of regional party organisations. Not even Hägglund&#x27;s own Jönköping district stood behind him. Eventually, however, all Hägglund&#x27;s possible contenders withdrew from the race, and his election as party leader on 3 April 2004 was unanimous.

Prior to the Swedish general election in 2006 Hägglund&#x27;s Christian Democrats formed a closer alliance with the three other centre-right parties in Sweden, under the name Alliance for Sweden. After their victory in the elections, Fredrik Reinfeldt of the Moderate Party was asked by the Speaker of the Riksdag to form a new government. Following negotiations between the leaders of the parties in the Alliance for Sweden, Göran Hägglund was named Minister for Social Affairs on 6 October 2006.

In the autumn of 2011 he was challenged for the post of party leader by colleague Mats Odell. In an extra congress held on 28 January 2012, Odell&#x27;s challenge failed and Hägglund retained the party leadership.

During a party rally in Gothenburg in 2014, Hägglund was hit with a pie by an LGBT rights activist.

On 29 January 2015, Hägglund announced that he would step down as party leader at an extra party congress on 25 April. Ebba Busch Thor was elected the new party leader at that congress.

== Minister for Social Affairs ==
Hägglund was appointed Minister for Social Affairs on 6 October 2006 by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.

As minister, Hägglund enforced several reforms including the reform of the health insurance system which became a highly controversial reform. Hägglund also implemented municipal allowance which replaced the former state allowance. The pharmacy monopoly was abolished on 1 July 2009, and the alcohol law was liberalized in 2010. Deduction for household services, so-called RUT deduction was introduced in 2007 as well as the legislation of same-sex marriages in 2009. The bill was supported by all parties except the Christian Democrats and one member of the Center Party.

==Personal life==
Hägglund grew up in the Pentecostal movement, but is now a member of the Church of Sweden. He is married and has two children.

<text>Heberto Castillo Martínez (August 23, 1928 – April 5, 1997) was a Mexican civil engineer, political activist and inventor of the tridilosa.

Castillo was born in Ixhuatlán de Madero, Veracruz, and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil engineering from the National Autonomous University. An accomplished engineer, he taught several courses at the UNAM and at the National Polytechnic Institute, wrote several textbooks and invented the tridilosa.

He became a political activist and got involved in several workers&#x27; rights struggles, leading to imprisonment by the federal government in the infamous Lecumberri Penitentiary. Castillo was one of the first among leading left-wing politicians to express dismay at the dictatorial nature of Soviet-bloc governments, starting a movement towards a social democracy-based left wing and away from a Moscow-based left leaning opposition in Mexico.

During his lifetime he co-founded three political parties: the Mexican Workers&#x27; Party &quot;(Partido Mexicano de los Trabajadores, PMT)&quot;, the Mexican Socialist Party &quot;(Partido Mexicano Socialista, PMS)&quot; and the Party of the Democratic Revolution &quot;(Partido de la Revolución Democrática, PRD)&quot;. In his last years in politics he became a staunch critic of the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas and, crucially, voluntarily withdrew from the presidential race in 1988 to support the unified candidacy of Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas.

He died on April 5, 1997 at the age of 68, in Mexico City and received the Belisario Domínguez Medal of Honor (&quot;postmortem&quot;) that same year.

<text>Indo-Caribbean or Indian-Caribbean people are people in the Caribbean who trace their ancestry to the Indian subcontinent. They are descendants of the Jahaji indentured laborers from British India, who were brought by the British, Dutch, and French during the colonial era from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century. A minority of them are descendants from people who immigrated as entrepreneurs, businesspeople, merchants, engineers, doctors, religious leaders, students, and other professional occupations beginning in the mid-20th century and continuing to the present. 

Indo-Caribbean people largely trace their ancestry back to the Bhojpur and Awadh regions of the Hindi Belt and the Bengal region in North India, in the present-day states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Jharkhand, with a significant minority coming from the Madras Presidency, especially present-day Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Other notable regions of origin include Western Uttar Pradesh, Mithila, Magadh, Chota Nagpur, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Pashtunistan, Punjab, and Kashmir. Most Indians in the French West Indies are of South Indian origin and Indians in Barbados are mostly of Bengali and Gujarati origin. Later immigrants to the Caribbean came from Sindh, Kutch, Gujarat, Punjab, Bengal, Maharashtra, South India, and other parts of South Asia as free immigrants.

Most Indo-Caribbean people live in the English-speaking Caribbean nations of Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and Guyana, the Dutch-speaking Suriname and the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana, with smaller numbers in other Caribbean countries including Belize and the islands of the Lesser Antilles. Large Indo-Caribbean immigrant populations are found in North America and Europe, specifically in the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United Kingdom. These countries have some of the largest Indo-Caribbean populations in the world, and Indo-Caribbeans in these countries have largely congregated in urban areas such as New York City, The Hague, Toronto, Rotterdam, London, Miami/Fort Lauderdale/West Palm Beach, Orlando/Ocala, Houston, Birmingham, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Montreal, Schenectady/Albany, Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Manchester, Washington D.C., and Paris.

Indo-Caribbean people may also be referred to as Caribbean Indians, [[East Indian people (disambiguation)|East Indian West Indians]], Caribbean Hindustanis, South Asian Caribbean people, or Caribbean Desis, while first-generation Indo-Caribbean people were called [[Girmityas|Girmitya]], [[Desi]], [[Hindustan|Hindustani]], Kantraki, Mulki (m.) / Mulkin (f.), or Jahaji (m.) / Jahajin (f.). &quot;Coolie&quot;, meaning hired laborer, was used in the plantation society of the late 19th to early 20th century, however in the present-day it is considered a derogatory way to refer to Indo-Caribbean people and is considered a pejorative.

==Migration history==

From 1838 to 1917, over half a million Indians from the former British Raj or British India and Colonial India, were taken to thirteen mainland and island nations in the Caribbean as indentured workers to address the demand for sugar cane plantation labour following the abolition of slavery.

===Sugarcane plantations in the 19th century===

Much like cotton, sugarcane plantations motivated large-scale near-enslavement and forced migrations in the 19th and early 20th century.

Following the passage of the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act, many formerly enslaved people left their enslavers. This created an economic chaos for European planters in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean. The hard work in hot, humid farms required a regular, docile and low-waged labour force, which led to the creation of the Indian indenture system. Poor economic conditions in India led to many Indians to look for sources of work. In this system, Indians were taken to British, French and Dutch colonies around the world, including in the Caribbean, to work on cash crop plantations.

The first ships carrying indentured labourers for sugarcane plantations left India in 1838 for the Caribbean region. In fact, the first two shiploads of Indians arrived in British Guiana (modern-day Guyana) on May 5, 1838, on board the Whitby and Hesperus.
These ships had sailed from Calcutta. In the early decades of the sugarcane-driven migrations, the working conditions for the indentured Indian workers were abysmal, due in large part to the lack of care among the planters.. They were confined to their estates and paid a pitiful salary. Any breach of contract brought automatic criminal penalties and imprisonment. Many of these were brought away from their homelands deceptively. Many from inland regions over a thousand kilometers from seaports were promised jobs, were not told the work they were being hired for, or that they would leave their homeland and communities. They were hustled aboard the waiting ships, unprepared for the long and arduous four-month sea journey. Charles Anderson, a special magistrate investigating these sugarcane plantations, wrote to the Colonial Secretary declaring that with few exceptions, the indentured labourers are treated with great and unjust severity; European planters enforced work in sugarcane farms so harshly, that the decaying remains of immigrants were frequently discovered in sugarcane fields. If indentured labourers protested and refused to work, they were not paid or fed by the planters.

The sugarcane plantation-driven migrations led to ethnically significant presence of Indians in Caribbean. In some islands and countries, these Indo-Caribbean migrants now constitute a significant proportion of the population. Sugarcane plantations and citizens of Indian origin continue to thrive in countries such as Guyana, formerly, British Guiana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Martinique, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, St. Kitts, St. Croix, Suriname and Nevis. By some estimates, over 2.5 million people in the Caribbean are of Indian origin. Many have ethnically blended with migrants from other parts of the world, creating a unique syncretic culture.

Though production was centered in the Caribbean, sugarcane production played a significant role in pre-World War II global politics and population movements. France, for example, negotiated with Britain leading to Act XLVI of 1860, whereby large numbers of Indian indentured labourers were brought for sugarcane plantation work in French colonies in the Caribbean region. The Caribbean colonies of the Netherlands too benefitted from the indentured laborers from India.

=== Arrival of Indian Women in the Caribbean ===
The ratio of female to male Indians coming to the Caribbean was for many years extremely low, 3:100 in 1938. The Indian government and the Colonial Office set up a quota system that dictated how many Indian women came to the Caribbean. In 1870, the quota called for 40 Indian women for every 100 Indian men, a quota that often was not met. In total, only 25% of all Indians who emigrated to the Caribbean were women. There were several reasons for fewer Indian women than men emigrating.

It was more expensive for agents to recruit Indian women than men, because not many Indian women wanted to leave India. It was more socially acceptable in India for men to emigrate and seek work. Women were not encouraged to do the same. Another factor dissuading Indian women from going to the Caribbean was the invasive medical examination administered upon arrival, which involved inspection of genitals. Many women did not want to have to undergo this examination and many men would not have wanted this to happen to their wives.

Additionally, the colonial powers present in the Caribbean were not initially interested in convincing Indian women to immigrate. Colonialists saw indentureship as a temporary replacement for the labor that had previously been done by enslaved African people. Their goal was to use Indian men for labor. They did not want Indian people to start families in the Caribbean, which would establish Indian culture and people as a lasting presence in the Caribbean, undermining the power of the indenture system to control all aspects of the laborer&#x27;s lives and force them into subjugation.

In the late 1800s, there was a change in policy. The late 1880s saw competition in the sugar industry from European beet sugar, and the colonial government knew that having a settled, immobile group of Indian people to exploit for labor would be highly profitable and advantageous in the competition to dominate the sugar industry. Encouraging Indian people to stay in the Caribbean also cut the costs required to bring Indian people back to India. As indentureships ended, the Indian men who had come to work as indentured laborers were given small parcels of land to encourage settlement. Another method of encouraging settlement was to encourage more Indian women to immigrate, since permanent settlement was no longer being discouraged by the colonial powers.

Indian women who were recruited and immigrated to the Caribbean were for the most part married women joining their husbands, single women, women who had been widowed, women trying to escape poverty, and women prostitutes from the cities of Calcutta and Chennai, then called Madras. Under the indenture system, married Indian women were excused from work on the plantations and planters were required to give them medical care and rations. However, the colonial government did not recognize Hindu or Muslim marriages until the 1940s, so many married women were categorized as single and did not receive the few privileges given to married women. Married women who did not have to work in the fields took care of children and expenses. Women who worked were paid less than men.

===Post World War II trends===

The majority of the Indians living in the English-speaking Caribbean came from eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar which are mostly speakers of Bhojpuri, Hindi, and Awadhi, while those brought to Guadeloupe and Martinique were largely from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. About twenty percent (20%) of the indentured were Tamils and Telugus particularly in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana.

A minority emigrated from other parts of South Asia, including present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Indo-Caribbean people comprise the largest ethnic group in Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname. They are the second largest group in Jamaica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Martinique and Guadeloupe.

There are also small communities in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, French Guiana, Panama, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, the Netherlands Antilles and Venezuela. Small groups also exist in Haiti, where they are sometimes mistakenly referred to as &quot;mulattos&quot;.

===Contemporary migration===
Modern-day immigrants from India (mostly Sindhi merchants) are to be found on Saint-Martin / Sint Maarten, St. Thomas, Curaçao and other islands with duty-free commercial capabilities, where they are active in business. Other Indo-Caribbean people descend from later migrants, including Indian doctors, Gujarati businessmen and migrants from Kenya and Uganda.

===Diaspora===

Indo-Caribbean people have migrated to the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and to other parts of the Caribbean and Latin America, including Venezuela, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Cuba.

==Culture==



The indentured Indians and their descendants have actively contributed to the evolution of their adopted lands in spite of many difficulties, particularly through the development of Caribbean cuisine and music.

The initial generations of indentured Indians brought several traditional Indian games to the region, though most of these are no longer played.

==Commemoration==
In recent years, attempts to commemorate the Indian presence and contributions to the Caribbean have come to fruition:

Indian Arrival Day is a holiday celebrated on May 30 in Trinidad and Tobago each year since the 1990s. It was first celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago and then other countries with significant Indian people whose ancestors came as indentured laborers. It commemorates the first arrivals from India to Trinidad and Tobago, on May 30, 1845, on the ship &quot;Fatel Razack&quot;

In 1995, Jamaica started to celebrate the arrival of Indians in Old Harbour Bay, St. Catherine Parish on May 13.

In 2003, Martinique celebrated the 150th anniversary of Indian arrival. Guadeloupe did the same in 2004. These celebrations were not the fact of just the Indian minority, but the official recognition by the French and local authorities of their integration and their wide-scale contributions in various fields including agriculture, education, and politics, and to the diversification of the culture of the Creole peoples. Thus, the noted participation of the whole multi-ethnic population of the two islands were in these events.

St. Lucia and many Caribbean countries have dedicated commemorative days to acknowledge the arrival and important contributions of their Indo-Caribbean populations. St. Lucia celebrates its Indo-Caribbean heritage on May 6. Other dates when India Arrival Day is celebrated in the Caribbean include May 5 (Guyana), May 10 (Jamaica), May 30 (Trinidad and Tobago), June 1 (St. Vincent), and June 5 (Suriname).

<doc id="1081218" wikidata="Q675825" url="?curid=1081218" title="Face to Face (The Kinks album)">
<text>Face to Face is the fourth studio album by the English rock band the Kinks, released on 28 October 1966. The album marked a shift from the hard-driving style of beat music that had catapulted the group to international acclaim in 1964, instead drawing heavily from baroque pop and music hall. It is their first album consisting entirely of Ray Davies compositions, and has also been regarded by critics as one of rock&#x27;s first concept albums. Davies&#x27; blossoming songwriting style became increasingly observational and satirical, commenting on English culture, social class and the music industry.

Despite containing the hit single, &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;, the album&#x27;s initial reception was lukewarm in both the UK and US compared to the Kinks&#x27; previous LPs, charting at No. 12 and No. 135, respectively. &quot;Face to Face&quot; eventually earned retrospective critical acclaim, recognized as a pivotal record of the psychedelic era and an important milestone in the Kinks&#x27; evolution. The album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Background==
Ray Davies suffered a nervous breakdown just prior to the major recording sessions for the album. In contrast to the band&#x27;s earlier &quot;raunchy&quot; sound, he had started to introduce a new, softer style of writing the previous year with compositions such as &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot; and &quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot;. In July 1966, the single &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot;, also written in that style, reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, and the song&#x27;s popularity proved to Davies and the Kinks&#x27; managers that the group could find success with this style of songwriting. The new album would follow this pattern, as would the group&#x27;s recorded output for the next five years. The 1966–71 period inaugurated by this album would later be called Davies&#x27; and the Kinks&#x27; &quot;golden age&quot;.

Rock historians have credited the album as arguably one of the first rock/pop concept albums, with the loose common theme of social observation. In the album&#x27;s original conception Ray Davies attempted to bridge the songs together with sound effects, but he was forced by Pye Records to revert to the more standard album format before the album&#x27;s release. Some effects remain, such as in &quot;Party Line&quot;, &quot;Holiday in Waikiki&quot;, &quot;Rainy Day in June&quot; and in songs not included on the final album (&quot;End of the Season&quot;, &quot;Big Black Smoke&quot;).

==Recording and production==

&quot;I&#x27;ll Remember&quot; was the earliest track on the album, having been recorded in October 1965 during sessions for &quot;The Kink Kontroversy&quot;. Two other songs recorded during the &quot;Face to Face&quot; sessions – &quot;This Is Where I Belong&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Got Everything&quot; – were eventually released as B-sides to singles released in 1967 and 1968, respectively. Both songs eventually appeared on the 1972 US compilation album &quot;The Kink Kronikles&quot;. Pete Quaife temporarily quit the band before the June–July 1966 recording sessions; his replacement John Dalton can only be confirmed as playing on the track &quot;Little Miss Queen of Darkness&quot;. Contractual issues held up the release of the album for several months after recording was completed; Ray Davies was also in conflict with Pye over the final album cover art, whose psychedelic theme he later felt was inappropriate.

Two songs on &quot;Face to Face&quot;, although written by Ray Davies, were originally recorded and released by other British bands in the months prior to the release of this album. The Pretty Things had a minor UK hit in July 1966 with &quot;A House in the Country&quot;, which peaked at No. 50; their final entry on the UK Singles Chart. Herman&#x27;s Hermits, meanwhile, took their version of &quot;Dandy&quot; top ten in several countries (including No. 5 in the US and No. 1 in Canada), beginning in September 1966. The Rockin&#x27; Vickers also recorded a version of &quot;Dandy&quot; which they released as a single in December 1966 in both the UK and the US. Despite what the sleeve notes say on The Rockin&#x27; Vickers &quot;The Complete&quot;, the song &quot;Little Rosy&quot; was not written by Ray Davies (Music: Herbie Armstrong; Lyrics: Paul Murphy).

==Release and reception==

The album was released in a particularly tumultuous year for the band, with personnel problems (Pete Quaife was injured; he resigned and later rejoined the band), legal and contractual battles and an ongoing hectic touring schedule. The album was critically well received, but did not sell particularly well at the time of its release (especially in the United States), and was out of print for many years. Reissues since 1998 have included bonus tracks of songs released contemporaneously as singles (most notably &quot;Dead End Street&quot;) as well as two unreleased tracks.
The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Unreleased songs==
&quot;Mr. Reporter&quot; was recorded in 1969 for Dave Davies&#x27; aborted solo album, and was released as a bonus track on the 1998 Castle CD reissue of &quot;Face to Face&quot;. An earlier version featuring Ray Davies on lead vocals was recorded in February 1966 and was apparently intended for this album or an unissued EP. The scathing track satirizes the pop press, and was probably shelved to prevent offending music journalists who had been crucial to the Kinks&#x27; commercial success. This early version was finally officially released in 2014.

Other unreleased songs from the &quot;Face to Face&quot; sessions reportedly include &quot;Fallen Idol&quot;, about the rise and fall of a pop star, &quot;Everybody Wants to Be a Personality&quot;, about celebrities, &quot;Lilacs and Daffodils&quot; (also known as &quot;Sir Jasper&quot;), which is reportedly about a schoolteacher (and is the only Kinks track with vocals by Mick Avory) and &quot;A Girl Who Goes to Discotheques&quot;. It is unclear whether any of the unreleased tracks will ever be released officially. Dave Davies indicated they were never satisfactorily completed for release, and some were later reworked into different songs such as &quot;Yes Man&quot;, another song from these sessions, which was an early version of &quot;Plastic Man&quot;. In a 2012 interview, Ray Davies stated that &quot;Lilacs and Daffodils&quot; was &quot;awful.&quot;

*Alan O&#x27;Duffy (credited as &quot;Irish&quot;) assistant engineer

Note
*On 3June 1966, Quaife was seriously injured in a car crash. In Ray&#x27;s 1994 autobiography, he wrote that, while Quaife recuperated from his injuries, the band hired an unidentified session bassist for a marathon session on 6June. Ray identified six songs recorded during the session: &quot;Rosy Won&#x27;t You Please Come Home&quot;, &quot;Too Much On My Mind&quot;, &quot;Session Man&quot;, &quot;Rainy Day In June&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Looking Fine&quot; and the unreleased &quot;Fallen Idol&quot;. Quaife disputed Ray&#x27;s account, contending that the six songs were recorded before his crash and that the bass guitar heard closely resembles his playing style. Talmy later said he did not recall hiring a session bassist for a marathon session and that the playing style does not resemble that of Herbie Flowers, whom Talmy typically called for session work. Hinman concludes: &quot;No definitive resolution to the confusion is available.&quot; According to Hinman, the bassist John Dalton&#x27;s only confirmed contribution to the album is on &quot;Little Miss Queen of Darkness&quot;, recorded 21June.

<text>Ralph Smith (August 8, 1858 – February 17, 1917) was a Canadian coal miner, labour leader, and politician.

Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, he emigrated to Canada with his wife in 1891 settling in Nanaimo, British Columbia. A miner by trade, Smith was a moderate trade unionist in Nanaimo. After being defeated in the 1894 provincial election, in 1898, he won election to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on a moderate &quot;Liberal-Labour&quot; platform. He ran for Vancouver&#x27;s seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1900 federal election. Reports vary on whether he ran as an Independent Labour-Liberal candidate defeating the official Liberal and Conservative candidates, but once elected, he joined the Liberal caucus. He was re-elected in the 1904 and 1908 elections as a Liberal. He was defeated in the 1911 election and in the 1912 BC provincial election. Smith subsequently returned to provincial politics and, returned to the provincial legislature in the 1916 provincial election that brought the British Columbia Liberal Party to power.

Smith served as Minister of Finance in the government of Premier Harlan Carey Brewster, and died in office on February 17, 1917. His wife, Mary Ellen Smith, succeeded him in the subsequent by-election (held January 1918) as an Independent Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). She subsequently became the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire.

Ralph Smith was a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, which was enacted in the province shortly after the Liberals came to power after ten previous attempts over the years had failed.

<text>Lattice Semiconductor Corporation is an American semiconductor company specializing in the design and manufacturing of low power field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Headquartered in the Silicon Forest area of Hillsboro, Oregon, the company also has operations in San Jose, Calif., Shanghai, Manila, Penang, and Singapore. Lattice Semiconductor has more than 1000 employees and an annual revenue of more than $660 million as of 2022. The company was founded in 1983 and went public in 1989. It is traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol LSCC.

==History==
===Founding and early growth===
Lattice was founded on April 3, 1983, by C. Norman Winningstad, Rahul Sud, and Ray Capece, with investment from Winningstad, Harry Merlo, Tom Moyer, and John Piacentini. Lattice was incorporated in Oregon in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Co-founder Sud left as president in December 1986, and Winningstad left in 1991 as chairman of the board. Early struggles led to chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1987. The company emerged from bankruptcy after 62 days and moved from its headquarters in an unincorporated area near Beaverton to a smaller building in Hillsboro, Oregon. Over the next year, the company shrank from 140 to 64 employees but posted record revenues.

Cyrus Tsui became the company&#x27;s chief executive officer in 1988. On November 9, 1989, Lattice became a publicly traded company when its shares were listed on the NASDAQ after in initial public offering. The initial share price was $6, and raised almost $14 million for the company. In July 1990, a second stock offering of nearly 1.5 million new shares raised $22.6 million at $16.25 per share.

In 1995, the company attempted to assert trademark rights in the term Silicon Forest beyond the use of its trademark for the use in semiconductor devices. They had registered the mark in 1985, but later conceded they could not prevent the usage of the term as a noun. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the company as their 162nd best small company in the United States in 1996, and Lattice began to double the size of its Hillsboro headquarters.

In 2000, annual revenues topped $560 million with profits of $160 million. Its stock price reached an all-time high of $41.34, adjusted for splits. For the next five years, however, the company recorded no annual profit.

===Acquisitions and leadership changes===

Lattice purchased Agere Corporation&#x27;s FPGA division in 2002. In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000. In 2005, Tsui was replaced as CEO by Steve Skaggs and the company laid off employees for the first time. In fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, the first annual profit since 2000.

In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs. For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million. In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore. Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters, and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009. Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck, former Zilog CEO, who had just sold Zilog in the previous year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November. The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million. Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.

In 2011, the company was ranked third among the world&#x27;s makers of field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices and second for CPLDs &amp; SPLDs. On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash. Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues. The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015 and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.

===Activity since 2016===
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market. In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, a private equity firm backed by China Reform Holdings Corporation announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice&#x27;s shares. The purchase of Lattice by Canyon Bridge was in September 2017 blocked by US President Donald Trump based on the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States on national security grounds under the Exon–Florio Amendment. The company re-located its headquarters back to its Hillsboro campus in 2019.

Activist investor Lion Point Capital purchased a six percent stake in Lattice in February 2018. The next month the company filled three new seats on its board with independent directors supported by Lion Point. That same year, Lattice replaced several members of its leadership team, including bringing in a new president and CEO, Jim Anderson, who previously worked at Advanced Micro Devices. Under the new leadership, Lattice shifted the company&#x27;s focus entirely to low-power field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Lattice acquired computer vision software company Mirametrix in November 2021.

Jim Anderson left Lattice in June 2024, at which time Lattice Chief Strategy and Marketing office Esam Elashmawi was appointed Interim CEO. On September 16, 2024, Lattice named Ford Tamer as CEO.

==Products==

Lattice primarily focuses on small, efficient low-power field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). It also sells programmable mixed-signal and interconnect products, related software and intellectual property (IP), for applications from edge computing to cloud computing. Lattice&#x27;s main products are those based on its Lattice Nexus small FPGA platform and Lattice Avant mid-range FPGA platform. Lattice products are used in a variety of end uses across the communication, computing (client and datacenter), industrial, automotive, and consumer electronics markets.

Lattice&#x27;s software offerings include design tools Diamond, Radiant, and Propel. It also provides solution stacks designed to provide its customers with application-specific toolkits to help them more easily and quickly design with Lattice technology.

<doc id="1081233" wikidata="Q102027" url="?curid=1081233" title="Fabio Cannavaro">
<text>Fabio Cannavaro (; born 13 September 1973) is an Italian professional football coach and former player who is the head coach of Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb. He is regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time.

A centre-back, he spent the majority of his career in Italy. He started his career at Napoli before spending seven years at Parma, with whom he won two Coppa Italia titles, the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana, and the 1999 UEFA Cup. After spells at Inter Milan and Juventus, he transferred (along with manager Fabio Capello) from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2006, with whom he won consecutive La Liga titles in 2007 and 2008. He returned to Juventus for one season in 2009–10 and retired from football in 2011 after a stint at Al-Ahli.

Cannavaro was part of the Italy team which won consecutive UEFA European Under-21 Championships in 1994 and 1996. After earning his first senior cap in 1997, he helped his national team to the final of UEFA Euro 2000, being named in the team of the tournament, and became captain in 2002, following Paolo Maldini&#x27;s retirement.

Cannavaro led Italy to victory in the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and was given the nickname &quot;Il Muro di Berlino&quot; (&quot;The Berlin Wall&quot;) by the Italian supporters due to his defensive performances, which saw Italy keep five clean sheets and concede only two goals, neither of which were in open play. He was awarded the Silver Ball after being named the tournament&#x27;s second-best player. He was named the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year, making him the only defender in history to have won the award. He also won the Ballon d&#x27;Or award in 2006 which made him the only defender to win the award in a decade and only the third of all time after Franz Beckenbauer and Matthias Sammer.

In 2009, Cannavaro overtook Maldini as the most-capped player in the country&#x27;s history. He retired from international football on 25 June 2010 following Italy&#x27;s failure to qualify for the knockout stages of the 2010 World Cup, having amassed 136 caps and 2 goals for the senior national team. In total, he represented Italy at four World Cups, two UEFA European Championships, the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. He is currently Italy&#x27;s second all-time appearance holder, behind Gianluigi Buffon, as well as Italy&#x27;s most capped defender.

Since his retirement, Cannavaro has coached club teams in the Middle East and China. He was briefly appointed as manager of the China national team in 2019. He was the head coach of Serie B club Benevento in the 2022–23 season, and in April 2024, he became head coach of Serie A club Udinese, successfully leading the club clear of the relegation zone. In December 2024, he was announced as the manager of Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb.

==Early life==
Fabio Cannavaro was born in Naples to Gelsomina Costanzo and Pasquale Cannavaro. His mother worked as a maid, while his father was a bank clerk. His father also played football for provincial side Giugliano. He has an elder sister named Renata and a younger brother named Paolo, also a professional footballer.

==Club career==
===1988–1995: Youth career and Napoli===

As a youngster, Cannavaro played for a team from Bagnoli before being quickly spotted by the scouts of Napoli, his hometown and favourite childhood team. Cannavaro initially served as the club&#x27;s ball boy and would often watch his idols Diego Maradona and Ciro Ferrara play. He later joined the club&#x27;s youth team, initially playing as a midfielder like his idol Marco Tardelli, before the team&#x27;s youth coach switched him to the role of centre-back. He gained a reputation when, in a training session at Napoli, the young Fabio produced a strong sliding challenge on Maradona, who was then the undisputed star of the club, to dispossess him. The rough challenge angered teammates and staff at Napoli. However, Maradona himself defended the promising player and encouraged him to play the way he wanted, and reportedly congratulated Cannavaro by giving him his boots as a souvenir after the training session.

Cannavaro&#x27;s progress as a player was such that he soon became a member of the first team alongside some of his childhood idols. Cannavaro&#x27;s debut in Serie A came on 7 March 1993, in Turin, in a 4–3 defeat to Juventus. As a centre-back alongside Ferrara, he soon demonstrated his anticipation, tackling, distribution and his ability to start attacking plays after winning possession. He scored his first career goal at the San Siro, against Milan, on 8 January 1995. However, despite his promising performances, the post-Maradona Napoli were in desperate need of funds and were soon forced to sell Cannavaro to Parma, where Cannavaro won the UEFA Cup and Coppa Italia, and was named the Serie A Defender of the Year. Cannavaro remained at Napoli until 1995, earning nearly 60 total appearances with the club, scoring one goal.

===1995–2002: Parma===
Cannavaro was sold to Parma in the summer of 1995, and in his first season, he was instantly a regular on the first team, scoring once in 29 appearances in the league. He would go on to win trophies with the club and achieve several personal accomplishments, such as being named the team&#x27;s captain. It was also in Parma that he met Gianluigi Buffon and Lilian Thuram, who would not only form one of the tightest defensive units of Europe with Cannavaro but would also become some of his closest friends in football. Further players featuring in this legendary Parma backline were Luigi Sartor, Roberto Mussi, Antonio Benarrivo, Luigi Apolloni and the Argentine Néstor Sensini. Cannavaro began to obtain success during his time at Parma. During his first season, Parma were eliminated in the second round of the Coppa Italia but finished in sixth place in Serie A that season, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Parma also reached the quarter-finals of the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup that season. Parma finished the 1996–97 Serie A season as runners-up to Serie A champions Juventus, allowing them to qualify for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Parma were once again eliminated in the second round of the Coppa Italia and in the first round of the UEFA Cup that season. In the 1997–98 season, Parma finished in fifth place in Serie A and reached the Coppa Italia semi-finals, whilst they were knocked out in the group stage of the Champions League, finishing second in their group to defending champions Borussia Dortmund.

In his fourth season with the club, Cannavaro won his only European trophy, the UEFA Cup, as well as winning the Coppa Italia. Parma finished the Serie A season in fourth place, with one point from Fiorentina in third place. In the following season, Fabio&#x27;s brother Paolo Cannavaro joined the team, and the two Cannavaro brothers were able to play alongside each other for the next two seasons. Fabio won his first Supercoppa Italiana title against Serie A champions Milan and Parma finished the Serie A season in fourth place, tied with Inter Milan for the final remaining Champions League spot. However, Parma lost 3–1 to Inter in the Serie A Champions League playoff match, failing to qualify for the Champions League group stage. They started in the third and final qualifying round of the Champions League and were eliminated by Rangers. They were knocked out in the round of 16 of both the UEFA Cup and the Coppa Italia that season.

In the 2000–01 season, Cannavaro aided in leading Parma to another Coppa Italia final, in which they were defeated by Fiorentina. They were eliminated in the third round of the UEFA Cup that season. Parma also finished the season in fourth place for the third consecutive season, which allowed them to go through to the Champions League qualifying round, although Parma were ultimately unable to qualify. In his final season with Parma, Cannavaro managed to win his second Coppa Italia title over Juventus, whilst Parma were eliminated in the round of 16 of the UEFA Cup, and finished the Serie A season in tenth place. In 1997, he began to earn call-ups to the national team&#x27;s senior squad due to his performances for Parma, and he was consistently one of the best defenders in Serie A. In his time with Parma, Cannavaro made over 250 appearances in all competitions, scoring five goals.

===2002–2004: Inter Milan===
In the summer of 2002, Cannavaro joined Inter Milan for a reported €23 million, on a four-year contract. At the time, Parma were in financial difficulty, while Inter had just lost a Serie A title in dramatic circumstances to Juventus and were in the process of rebuilding following four barren years and the departure of star striker Ronaldo. Along with Francesco Coco and his former Parma teammate Hernán Crespo, Cannavaro was supposed to be one of the faces of a new-look Inter led by manager Héctor Cúper.

However, during Cannavaro&#x27;s spell with the club, Inter mostly flattered to deceive. His stint with the club began promisingly, as Inter reached the semi-finals of the 2002–03 Champions League and also finished runners-up in Serie A to Juventus in his first season with the club. However, his second season was not as productive, and he missed a large chunk of it through injury. He was also often played out of position. Inter finished fourth in Serie A and reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to Juventus on penalties. Inter finished third in their Champions League group but would go on to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. After two years with the club, he was sold to Juventus in a part-exchange deal after just over 50 appearances and two goals. After he left Italy, Cannavaro often spoke negatively of his spell at Inter, comparing the club unfavourably with his other Italian clubs, Parma and Juventus.

===2004–2006: Juventus and &quot;Calciopoli&quot;===
After a two-year stint with Inter, Cannavaro signed for Juventus on the summer transfer window deadline day. The deal also involved the exchange of reserve goalkeeper Fabian Carini, who left for Inter, both players priced €10 million. By moving to Turin, he reunited with his ex-Parma teammates Lilian Thuram and Gianluigi Buffon, and together the trio formed one of the most feared defences in the Serie A, alongside the likes of Gianluca Zambrotta, Gianluca Pessotto, Alessandro Birindelli, Jonathan Zebina and Federico Balzaretti. Juventus went on to win two consecutive &quot;Scudetti&quot; in 2005 and 2006, although they suffered consecutive quarter final eliminations in the Champions League. In the former season, he was also paired with club icons Paolo Montero and Ciro Ferrara. Cannavaro also won four &quot;Oscar del Calcio&quot; awards for his exceptional seasons with the Turin giants, winning the 2005 Serie A Defender of the Year, the 2006 Defender of the Year, the 2006 Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year and the 2006 Serie A Footballer of the Year.

After the 2006 World Cup, the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; trial verdicts relegated Juventus to Serie B. Since Juventus were ineligible to qualify for the Champions League, Cannavaro decided to leave. &quot;Even if I know this may be hard to believe, I would have stayed at Juventus had they remained in Serie A – even with a 30-point deduction.&quot; He followed Juve manager Fabio Capello to Real Madrid in the summer of 2006. In his two-year &quot;Scudetto&quot;-winning stint with Juventus, Cannavaro made over 100 total appearances in all competitions. His transfer was met with disappointment from the Juventus fans, who had accepted him as one of their own.

===2006–2009: Real Madrid===

Real Madrid paid €7 million to sign Cannavaro, and gave him the number 5 shirt which had previously been worn by French international Zinedine Zidane. Cannavaro spent three seasons at Madrid, winning the Liga title in 2006–07 and 2007–08, and being named the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year, also winning the 2006 Ballon d&#x27;Or. Cannavaro was elected as part of the 2006 and the 2007 FIFPro World XI squads, and the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year. He was named in the six-man shortlist for the 2007 Laureus World Sportsman of the Year.

On 19 May 2009, it was confirmed Cannavaro would return to Juventus for the 2009–10 season at the conclusion of his contract. On his final match at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, he was given a standing ovation by the fans. In April 2013, Cannavaro was named by &quot;Marca&quot; as a member of the &quot;Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid&#x27;s history&quot;.

===2009–2010: Return to Juventus===
Three years after Cannavaro left Juventus, and following the end of his contract with Real Madrid, in the summer of 2009, he decided to return to the club on a free transfer. Cannavaro started the new season very well, forming good defensive partnerships with Nicola Legrottaglie, Martín Cáceres, Zdeněk Grygera, Fabio Grosso and most notably Giorgio Chiellini, in front of goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. However, from Autumn onwards, Juventus&#x27; form took a turn for the worse. Having been injured for a while in late 2009, Cannavaro struggled with his own form both on his comeback and subsequently, and Juventus were knocked out of the Champions League, finishing third in their group.

In March 2010, Cannavaro&#x27;s relationship with the Juventus supporters, already fragile due to a perceived betrayal of the club when he left for Real Madrid, reached an all-time low. In a UEFA Europa League tie against Fulham, Juventus, who had won the first leg 3–1 at home, were leading 1–0 at Craven Cottage in London. Early in the first half, Cannavaro accumulated two bookings for reckless challenges and was sent off. Reduced to ten men, Juventus collapsed to a 4–1 loss and were eliminated on aggregate. Cannavaro enraged supporters with the sending-off and its consequent role in the team&#x27;s elimination. Juventus were also eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia to eventual champions and treble winners Inter Milan.

The club finished the league season in seventh place, with only a Europa League spot, its worst Serie A finish for a decade. Juventus subsequently confirmed Cannavaro&#x27;s contract would not be renewed. His performances had become unreliable, so much so that his hometown club Napoli made no attempt to sign him, despite Cannavaro expressing his wish to rejoin the club on more than one occasion.

===2010–2011: Al-Ahli===
On 2 June 2010, it was announced Cannavaro would move to UAE League side Al-Ahli on a free transfer after the 2010 World Cup. Cannavaro signed a two-year deal. He made 16 appearances for the Dubai club, scoring two goals. Cannavaro announced his retirement from football in July 2011 due to a serious knee problem; doctors had told him he could no longer play.

One year after Cannavaro&#x27;s retirement from Al-Ahli, it was announced he was joining the Indian league team Siliguri. In a footballers&#x27; auction whose line-up included names such as Jay-Jay Okocha, Hernán Crespo and Robbie Fowler, Cannavaro was bought by Siliguri for $830,000, exceeding his &quot;base price&quot; by $50,000. However, the league never came to fruition and Cannavaro stayed in retirement.

==International career==

===Youth career===
Cannavaro&#x27;s first taste of international success came over in the mid-1990s under coach Cesare Maldini with Italy&#x27;s under-21 side, winning two consecutive UEFA European Under-21 Championship titles, in 1994 and 1996, and developing an important defensive partnership with Alessandro Nesta, which would also continue at senior level. In 1996, he participated also at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He subsequently played for his country in the 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, as well as in the 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships.

===Early senior career and 1998 World Cup===

Cannavaro made his debut with the Italy national team on 22 January 1997, in a friendly match against Northern Ireland. The same year, he earned plaudits for his handling of England striker Alan Shearer in a World Cup qualifying game at Wembley Stadium. Shearer was then considered by the partisan English crowd to be the best striker in the world, and thought he would make fun of the inexperienced Italian defender. Nevertheless, in a display ranking alongside those of the very best Italian defenders Claudio Gentile and Franco Baresi, Cannavaro managed to keep Shearer quiet for the whole game. Italy won the game 1–0 courtesy of a Gianfranco Zola goal.

Cannavaro&#x27;s first international tournament came at 1998 World Cup alongside the experienced and capable Giuseppe Bergomi, Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini, as well as the emerging Alessandro Nesta, with Paolo Maldini&#x27;s father, Cesare Maldini, as head coach. Cannavaro made several strong performances throughout the tournament, although Italy eventually went out in the quarter-finals to hosts and eventual champions France, in a match where Cannavaro suffered a cut to his forehead following an elbow by Stéphane Guivarc&#x27;h. The &quot;Azzurri&quot; managed a 0–0 draw, eventually being decided by a penalty shoot-out in favour of the hosts.

===Euro 2000 Final, 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004===
At Euro 2000, under manager Dino Zoff, Cannavaro had a strong tournament, playing as centre-back alongside either Alessandro Nesta, Mark Iuliano or Paolo Maldini in 3–5–2 formation. The Italian defence only conceded two goals &quot;en route&quot; to the final: one against Turkey, and one against Sweden, both in the group stage, keeping three clean sheets in total. The &quot;Azzurri&quot; reached the final after defeating the Netherlands on penalties following a goalless draw in regulation time. Italy led the then-world champions France 1–0 going into injury time. However, Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the final minute of injury time, and an extra-time golden goal from David Trezeguet gave France the title. Cannavaro was elected as part of the Team of the Tournament for his performances.

At the 2002 World Cup, under manager Giovanni Trapattoni, Cannavaro was credited with holding the defence together almost single-handedly after his usual defensive partner Alessandro Nesta was injured against Croatia. This injury, alongside several errors by match officials, dealt a severe blow to Italy&#x27;s chances of winning the World Cup, the side having relied heavily on the Cannavaro–Nesta partnership in central defence. Marco Materazzi, who deputised for Nesta, put in performances that were below his usual standards. Cannavaro picked up two yellow card during the group stage and was suspended for the round of 16 match, meaning Italy would be left without their two starting centre-backs. Italy went out controversially in the second round, losing to co-hosts and eventual semi-finalists South Korea, once again to a golden goal.

Cannavaro had a difficult act to follow when he took over as captain from Paolo Maldini after the 2002 World Cup, but he quickly won the team over with his leadership, calming influence and inspirational performances, helping Italy qualify for Euro 2004. After Maldini&#x27;s international retirement, he first captained Italy in a 1–0 defeat to Slovenia in Trieste on 21 August 2002. He was later officially named Italy&#x27;s captain for an away UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match against Azerbaijan on 7 September, which Italy won 2–0. In Italy&#x27;s qualifier against Serbia and Montenegro in Naples, on 12 October, he received a standing ovation on the pitch where he wore the local side&#x27;s colours, as Italy drew 1–1.

Cannavaro scored his first international goal on 30 May 2004, in a 4–0 win against Tunisia, in Tunis. Euro 2004, which was hosted by Portugal, turned out to be a disappointment. Cannavaro picked up yellow cards during his nations two opening group draws with Denmark (0–0) and Sweden (1–1), forcing him to sit out the final group match. Italy defeated Bulgaria 2–1, but failed to advance on goal difference.

===2006 World Cup winner===

Cannavaro captained Italy throughout their successful 2006 World Cup campaign with composure and aplomb under manager Marcello Lippi. One of his key performances came in a 2–0 extra-time win against hosts Germany in the semi-finals of the tournament: in the last minute of extra-time, with Italy leading 1–0 and facing a German attack, Cannavaro outjumped Per Mertesacker to clear the ball from his area. He subsequently ran forward to dispossess Lukas Podolski, and carried the ball up to Francesco Totti in midfield, who started the play that led to Italy&#x27;s second goal, which was scored by Alessandro Del Piero from an assist by Alberto Gilardino. However, Cannavaro&#x27;s crowning moment was lifting the World Cup trophy on 9 July 2006, the night of his 100th cap. Cannavaro did not receive a single yellow or red card during the 690 minutes he played in the tournament. His defensive performance in the final earned him the nickname of &quot;Wall of Berlin&quot;, as the final was played in Berlin.

Along with goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, Cannavaro played each minute of every match in the tournament for Italy, completing 211 passes and winning 16 challenges. Even with usual defensive partner Alessandro Nesta out due to injury, the Italian defence kept a record five clean sheets and conceded only two goals throughout the entire tournament: an own-goal against the United States and a Zinedine Zidane penalty in the final against France.

Cannavaro&#x27;s leadership and marshalling of the Italian defence throughout their march to the final earned him a place in the All-Star Team at the end of the competition (awarded by FIFA&#x27;s Technical Study Group) alongside six other Italian teammates: Gianluigi Buffon, Francesco Totti, Gennaro Gattuso, Andrea Pirlo, Luca Toni and Gianluca Zambrotta. He was runner-up in the race for the Golden Ball, finishing behind French counterpart Zinedine Zidane; it was a close contest with Zidane polling 2012 points to Cannavaro&#x27;s 1977. Cannavaro was also awarded the 2006 Ballon d&#x27;Or and the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year for his performances throughout the season and at the World Cup, also being named to the FIFPro World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year.

===Euro 2008===
On 2 June 2008, Cannavaro was injured during Italy&#x27;s first training session for Euro 2008. He sustained a knock following a tackle by fellow defender Giorgio Chiellini and was carried off the field on a stretcher. Italian squad doctor Paolo Zeppilli said, &quot;We have to do tests but it does not look like a minor injury.&quot; These tests consequently showed that he had torn ligaments in his left ankle. Right after the examinations, Italian journalists waited for Cannavaro, who told them simply, &quot;I&#x27;m going home&quot;, with a melancholic smile on his face. With that news, Italy manager Roberto Donadoni then called up Fiorentina centre-back Alessandro Gamberini as his official replacement. Alessandro Del Piero captained the team in his place. Cannavaro added that he would stay with the squad to offer support. This would have been Cannavaro&#x27;s third Euro tournament.

Cannavaro also put his plans to retire from the national team after Euro 2008 on hold and added that the injury had made him more determined than ever to captain Italy through the 2010 World Cup.

=== Record-breaking caps at the 2009 Confederations Cup===
In Italy&#x27;s final 2009 Confederations Cup group match against Brazil, Cannavaro equalled Paolo Maldini&#x27;s record of being Italy&#x27;s most capped player, although Italy were defeated 3–0 and were disappointingly eliminated from the tournament in the group stage. On 12 August 2009, in a friendly match against Switzerland, Cannavaro became Italy&#x27;s most capped player of all time. He won his 127th cap for his country, beating Maldini&#x27;s former record of 126.

===2010 World Cup and retirement===
Cannavaro captained Italy at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, once again under Marcello Lippi, although his performances were not as strong as in previous editions, and he and the Italian squad received criticism from the press. The defending champions crashed out of the competition in the first round, losing 3–2 to Slovakia in their final group match, after drawing 1–1 against both New Zealand and Paraguay. Following Italy&#x27;s failure to progress past the group stage, Cannavaro announced his retirement from international football. In total, Cannavaro made 136 appearances for Italy between 1997 and 2010, scoring 2 goals, making him the second-most capped Italian player of all time, behind only Gianluigi Buffon. Cannavaro has also made the second-most appearances for Italy as captain, behind only Buffon, wearing the armband on 79 occasions.

==Managerial career==

===Al-Ahli===
After his retirement, Cannavaro was appointed a global brand ambassador and technical consultant of Al-Ahli Club of Dubai on 25 August 2011. In July 2013, after Cosmin Olăroiu took charge as new head coach of Al-Ahli, Cannavaro was named as his first team coach. He guided Al-Ahli to UAE Pro League and UAE League Cup titles in his first season in charge.

===Guangzhou Evergrande===
On 5 November 2014, Cannavaro was named as the new head coach of Chinese Super League title-holder and four-time champions Guangzhou Evergrande, replacing his former national team manager Marcello Lippi. Cannavaro was formally unveiled by the club on the same day. On 4 June 2015, Guangzhou Evergrande suddenly announced Cannavaro was replaced by Luiz Felipe Scolari after a Super League match against Tianjin Teda.

===Al Nassr===
On 24 October 2015, Cannavaro was named new head coach of Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr replacing Jorge da Silva. The following 11 February, he rescinded his contract.

===Tianjin Quanjian===
On 9 June 2016, Tianjin Quanjian, who were on a streak of seven consecutive competitive matches without a win under Vanderlei Luxemburgo, announced Cannavaro became the new manager of the club. They were ranked eighth place in the league at the time, and on 22 October he guided Quanjian to the 2016 China League One title, thus sealing their promotion to the 2017 Chinese Super League.

Under Cannavaro, Quanjian finished third in their top-tier debut with 15 wins, 9 draws and 6 losses and advanced to 2018 AFC Champions League Qualifying play-offs. On 6 November 2017, Quanjian announced the club accepted Cannavaro&#x27;s resignation from the club. He won the Chinese Football Association Coach of the Year award in November 2017.

===Return to Guangzhou Evergrande===
On 9 November 2017, Guangzhou Evergrande appointed Cannavaro as manager for the second time. He was relieved of his position on 27 October 2019, and went to corporate culture training, with captain Zheng Zhi the acting manager. He returned six days later. On 1 December 2019, he won the Chinese Super League. Cannavaro left Guangzhou again in September 2021.

===China national team===
On 15 March 2019, Cannavaro was appointed manager of the China national team, in conjunction with coaching Guangzhou Evergrande. Six days later he lost his first match in charge, a 1–0 home defeat in the China Cup to Thailand. On 28 April, he stood down to focus on his role at Guangzhou Evergrande.

===Benevento===
On 21 September 2022, Cannavaro took on his first managerial job in his native Italy, becoming the new head coach of Serie B club Benevento. On 4 February 2023, after failing to improve the club&#x27;s fortunes and with the club deep into the relegation zone, he was sacked by Benevento.

===Udinese===
On 22 April 2024, Cannavaro became the new manager of Serie A club Udinese in substitution of Gabriele Cioffi. A few days after escaping relegation on the final matchday of the season following a dramatic 1–0 away win against Frosinone, who were overtaken by Udinese and got relegated following that result, the club announced Cannavaro&#x27;s departure from the club.

===Dinamo Zagreb===
In December 2024, Cannavaro was confirmed as the new manager of Croatian club GNK Dinamo Zagreb, marking his first adventure in a foreign country in Europe. Cannavaro&#x27;s first competitive march was in the UCL against Arsenal, where Dinamo lost 3-0. Cannavaro had his first competitive win against AC Milan, however despite Dinamo winning 2-1, the club failed to reach the knockout playoffs of the UCL.

==Style of play==
Cannavaro is considered one of the greatest defenders of all time, winning the World Cup as Italy&#x27;s captain, as well as the Ballon d&#x27;Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year Award in 2006. Although he predominantly excelled as a centre-back, due to his ability to read the game, he was also deployed as a right or left sided full-back on occasion, in particular under his Inter coach Héctor Cúper. This was made possible due to Cannavaro&#x27;s tactical intelligence, versatility, technical ability, ball playing ability, stamina, low centre of gravity and pace, which also enabled him to start plays from the backline after winning possession.

As a defender, Cannavaro was known in particular for his concentration, anticipation, awareness and positional sense. Despite his relatively small stature for a defender, he was highly regarded for his aerial ability, courtesy of his elevation, physical strength, athleticism, timing and heading accuracy, which enabled him to outjump larger players and made him particularly adept at defending crosses, or at scoring with his head from set-pieces. Throughout his career, he made a name for himself as a dynamic, consistent, tenacious and complete defender, known for his acceleration, speed, reactions, and agility, as well as his tackling ability, and in particular, his precise sliding challenges. Due to his wide range of skills, he excelled in a zonal marking system, but was also an excellent man-marker. During his time at Parma under manager Alberto Malesani, he also stood out for his ability to press opposing forwards, which allowed the team to maintain a high three-man defensive line effectively. Nicknamed &quot;Canna&quot; (&quot;reed&quot;), by his former Italy defensive teammate Paolo Maldini, as a reference to his surname and mental strength, in addition to his ability as a defender, Cannavaro was also known for his leadership, determination, strong temperament and charisma, both on and off the pitch, as well as his ability to organise his defence. Cannavaro also attributes his positive character, calm composure under pressure and self-assurance in his abilities, as well as his diet, work-rate and discipline in training, as some of the key reasons for his success as a footballer, as well as his ability to inspire confidence in his teammates.

==Media==

Cannavaro was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Cannavaro starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scopion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;. A 2010 Nike commercial, Write the Future directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, begins with Cannavaro making an impressive goal-line clearance from a Didier Drogba shot, before it cuts away to him being guest of honour on a Mediaset-style Italian variety programme, where dancers wearing sequined variations of his #6 shirt re-enact the clearance while suspended on wires.

Cannavaro was on the cover of the Italian edition of SCEE&#x27;s &quot;This is Football 2003&quot;. Cannavaro also features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was named to the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;. An icon in &quot;FIFA 19&quot;, Cannavaro has a 92 rating. Cannavaro worked as a pundit on ITV during the 2014 World Cup.

==Personal life==
Cannavaro married Daniela Arenoso (b. 1974) on 17 June 1996, they have three children, Christian (b. 1998) – also a footballer, who was playing as a midfielder for Serie B side Benevento before retiring in 2019 - Martina (b. 2001) and Andrea (b. 2004).

Cannavaro&#x27;s younger brother, Paolo, was also a defender who last played for Sassuolo, and previously also played for Napoli, Verona and Parma. The two brothers played alongside each other at Parma from 2000 until 2002, when Fabio left for Inter. Before his retirement, Fabio had often expressed interest in ending his career with Paolo in a Napoli shirt.

With his fellow Neapolitan friend and former defensive teammate Ciro Ferrara, Cannavaro has helped establish a charity foundation, &quot;Fondazione Cannavaro Ferrara&quot;, specialising in the procurement of cancer research equipment and surgery for special cases of cancer for a hospital in their native Naples; the foundation also aims to help at-risk youth in Naples.

==Controversies==
The night before the 1999 UEFA Cup Final, a videotape was released which showed Cannavaro being injected with a substance. The substance was found to be neoton (phosphocreatine), which is used in cardiac surgery to protect the heart during periods of anoxia and stress. It is not on the banned substance list. This chemical is, in partnership with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), fundamental to the ability of the body to produce muscular energy. Phosphocreatine is formed naturally within the body, with over 95% of the compound stored within the muscle cells. The body also receives dietary creatine primarily through the consumption of meat. No action was taken regarding this incident.

On 8 October 2009, Cannavaro failed a drug test. However, Juventus claimed the drugs were medicine for a severe allergic reaction to a wasp sting and not performance-enhancing. Because of the urgent nature of the treatment, Cannavaro could not ask for permission to CONI in time, which was done immediately afterwards. Apparently, while awaiting the conclusion of formalities involved for CONI with granting this permission, he was subjected to the drug test that eventually gave a positive result. CONI later dropped charges against him.

In February 2015, Cannavaro, his wife Daniela and his brother Paolo were respectively handed ten-month, four-month and six-month prison sentences for breaching orders and entering Fabio&#x27;s residence after authorities seized it in 2009 amid an investigation into fraudulent activity and tax evasion. All three have appealed and will have their sentences suspended until the final judgement.

<doc id="1081235" wikidata="Q534282" url="?curid=1081235" title="Lava dome">
<text>In volcanology, a lava dome is a circular, mound-shaped protrusion resulting from the slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano. Dome-building eruptions are common, particularly in convergent plate boundary settings. Around 6% of eruptions on Earth form lava domes. The geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt (e.g. Semeru, 1946) to rhyolite (e.g. Chaiten, 2010) although the majority are of intermediate composition (such as Santiaguito, dacite-andesite, present day) The characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far. This high viscosity can be obtained in two ways: by high levels of silica in the magma, or by degassing of fluid magma. Since viscous basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava, most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite.

Existence of lava domes has been suggested for some domed structures on the Moon, Venus, and Mars, e.g. the Martian surface in the western part of Arcadia Planitia and within Terra Sirenum.

==Dome dynamics==

Lava domes evolve unpredictably, due to non-linear dynamics caused by crystallization and outgassing of the highly viscous lava in the dome&#x27;s conduit. Domes undergo various processes such as growth, collapse, solidification and erosion.

Lava domes grow by endogenic dome growth or exogenic dome growth. The former implies the enlargement of a lava dome due to the influx of magma into the dome interior, and the latter refers to discrete lobes of lava emplaced upon the surface of the dome. It is the high viscosity of the lava that prevents it from flowing far from the vent from which it extrudes, creating a dome-like shape of sticky lava that then cools slowly in-situ. Spines and lava flows are common extrusive products of lava domes. Domes may reach heights of several hundred meters, and can grow slowly and steadily for months (e.g. Unzen volcano), years (e.g. Soufrière Hills volcano), or even centuries (e.g. Mount Merapi volcano). The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the intermittent buildup of gas pressure, erupting domes can often experience episodes of explosive eruption over time. If part of a lava dome collapses and exposes pressurized magma, pyroclastic flows can be produced. Other hazards associated with lava domes are the destruction of property from lava flows, forest fires, and lahars triggered from re-mobilization of loose ash and debris. Lava domes are one of the principal structural features of many stratovolcanoes worldwide. Lava domes are prone to unusually dangerous explosions since they can contain rhyolitic silica-rich lava.

Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismicity, which is attributed to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics of lava domes include their hemispherical dome shape, cycles of dome growth over long periods, and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity. The average rate of dome growth may be used as a rough indicator of magma supply, but it shows no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristics of lava dome explosions.

Gravitational collapse of a lava dome can produce a block and ash flow.

==Related landforms==
===Cryptodomes===
A cryptodome (from the Greek , , &quot;hidden, secret&quot;) is a dome-shaped structure created by accumulation of viscous magma at a shallow depth. One example of a cryptodome was in the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, where the explosive eruption began after a landslide caused the side of the volcano to collapse, leading to explosive decompression of the subterranean cryptodome.

===Lava spine/Lava spire===

A lava spine or lava spire is a growth that can form on the top of a lava dome. A lava spine can increase the instability of the underlying lava dome. A recent example of a lava spine is the spine formed in 1997 at the Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat.

===Lava coulées===

Coulées (or coulees) are lava domes that have experienced some flow away from their original position, thus resembling both lava domes and lava flows.

The world&#x27;s largest known dacite flow is the Chao dacite dome complex, a huge coulée flow-dome between two volcanoes in northern Chile. This flow is over long, has obvious flow features like pressure ridges, and a flow front tall (the dark scalloped line at lower left). There is another prominent coulée flow on the flank of Llullaillaco volcano, in Argentina, and other examples in the Andes.

<text>Aumühle () is a municipality in Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany, about 21 km (14 mi) east of Hamburg. Its Friedrichsruh district is home to the family estate and mausoleum of Otto von Bismarck.

== Geography ==
Aumühle lies on the river Bille in the Sachsenwald, the largest forest in Schleswig-Holstein.

== History ==

In 1350 Aumühle was first mentioned in writing as &quot;Au-Mühle&quot; (mill on the river Au).

In 1846, a station on the newly-constructed Hamburg-Berlin railway line was opened at Friedrichsruh. Aumühle station itself was added in 1884.

In 1871 Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany gifted the Sachsenwald forest, adjacent to the Au, to Otto von Bismarck in recognition of his services to the newly unified German nation. Bismarck had a manor house built there, opting to retain the historic name of Friedrichsruh. Bismarck now lies buried in the Bismarck Mausoleum situated there.

Karl Dönitz, the last head of state of Nazi Germany, moved to Aumühle after his release from Spandau Prison in 1956. He lived there until his death in 1980, and was buried in its Waldfriedhof cemetery. In Aumühle lived German journalist and politician Olaf von Wrangel.

== Transport ==
Aumühle is the eastern terminus of Hamburg S-Bahn line S21.

== Twin towns==
Aumühle is twinned with:
* Mortagne-sur-Sèvre France
* Sleen, today a part of Coevorden, Netherlands

<text>Two Kinds of Laughter is an album by the American singer-songwriter Sara Hickman, released in 1998.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; thought that &quot;Belew generally stays out of the way of Hickman&#x27;s breezy, congenial folk-pop, keeping the focus on her achingly earnest lyrics and lithe, undemanding melodies.&quot;

AllMusic wrote that &quot;Hickman creates an inviting tension in her songs, pitting unusual lyric lines against catchy melodies.&quot;

Soon after the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, he served a stint in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. He was active in performing in and producing shows while he was in the Army Air Corps. After his military service, he began his acting career.

== Acting career ==
Repp acted in stage productions on the West Coast before World War II.

At the beginning of his film career, Repp appeared in numerous film and TV productions including the films &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958) with Susan Hayward, and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov,&quot; both made in 1958. Also at this same time he began to appear in a string of early television programs from the middle 1950s to the early 1960s, including NBC&#x27;s western anthology series &quot;Frontier&quot; and the Barry Sullivan/Clu Gulager western, &quot;The Tall Man&quot;.

Repp appeared on Rod Cameron&#x27;s &quot;State Trooper&quot;, Barbara Eden&#x27;s &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;, Peter Lawford&#x27;s &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1957), Tom Tryon&#x27;s &quot;Texas John Slaughter&quot; (1958), Rex Allen&#x27;s &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot; (1959), &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1959), Howard Duff&#x27;s &quot;Dante&quot; (1961), Walter Brennan&#x27;s &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; (1957 and 1959), &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1957, 1960 &amp; 1965), &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; (1960), &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot; (1960), &quot;Angel&quot; (1961), and &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1962 and 1963). He appeared as Joe Melvin, a plumber, in a 1963 episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Lucy and Viv Put in a Shower&quot;.

Repp made four appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; between 1959 and 1962 in minor roles, including Private Investigator Phillip Morgan in &quot;The Case of the Petulant Partner.&quot;

From 1963 to 1964, he portrayed Brink, the factory supervisor on Phil Silvers&#x27; &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot;. His series co-stars were Buddy Lester, Herbie Faye, Elena Verdugo, Ronnie Dapo, and Sandy Descher.

Repp made appearances in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episodes &quot;Nick of Time&quot; which starred William Shatner; a supporting role in &quot;The Grave&quot; with a cast which consisted of Lee Marvin, Lee Van Cleef, Strother Martin, James Best, and Elen Willard; then finally in &quot;Caesar and Me.&quot;

In early 1966, he appeared as a railroad detective in an episode in the last season of &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;.

In 1966, he started his stint as Chief O&#x27;Hara on &quot;Batman&quot;. While on &quot;Batman&quot;, he appeared as a guest in numerous other television programs, including &quot;Love American Style&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot;, in the latter once again playing a policeman.

His last released film was &quot;Linda Lovelace for President&quot; in 1975. He had a posthumous appearance in &quot;Mannix&quot; that was first broadcast two months after his death. His last television appearance was on the TV show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (as a Military Police Officer) that was first broadcast four months after his death. Shortly before his death in 1974, he filmed several scenes for Orson Welles&#x27; unfinished film &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;, which was not completed and released until 2018.

==Personal life==
Repp was married and had five children.

Repp died at age 56 on November 5, 1974, in Inglewood, California. He is interred at Westminster Memorial Park in Westminster, California. After his death, his sister, a television writer, established the Stafford Repp Memorial Scholarship for alumni of his alma mater, Lowell High School.

<text>The Conservative Revolution (), also known as the German neoconservative movement, or new nationalism, was a German national-conservative and ultraconservative movement prominent in Germany and Austria between 1918 and 1933 (from the end of World War I up to the Nazi seizure of power).

Conservative revolutionaries were involved in a cultural counter-revolution and showed a wide range of diverging positions concerning the nature of the institutions Germany had to instate, labelled by historian Roger Woods the &quot;conservative dilemma&quot;. Nonetheless, they were generally opposed to traditional Wilhelmine Christian conservatism, egalitarianism, liberalism and parliamentarian democracy as well as the cultural spirit of the bourgeoisie and modernity. Plunged into what historian Fritz Stern has named a deep &quot;cultural despair&quot;, uprooted as they felt within the rationalism and scientism of the modern world, theorists of the Conservative Revolution drew inspiration from various elements of the 19th century, including Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s contempt for Christian ethics, democracy and egalitarianism; the anti-modern and anti-rationalist tendencies of German Romanticism; the vision of an organic and naturally-organized folk community cultivated by the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement; the Prussian tradition of militaristic and authoritarian nationalism; and their own experience of comradeship and irrational violence on the front lines of World War I.

The Conservative Revolution held an ambiguous relationship with Nazism from the 1920s to the early 1930s, which has led scholars to describe it as a form of &quot;German pre-fascism&quot; or &quot;non-Nazi fascism&quot;. Although they share common roots in 19th-century anti-Enlightenment ideologies, the disparate movement cannot be easily confused with Nazism. Conservative Revolutionaries were not necessarily racialist as the movement cannot be reduced to its &quot;Völkisch&quot; component. Although they participated in preparing the German society to the rule of the Nazi Party with their antidemocratic and organicist theories, and did not really oppose their rise to power, Conservative Revolutionary writings did not have a decisive influence on Nazism, and the movement was brought to heel like the rest of the society when Adolf Hitler seized power in 1933, culminating in the assassination of prominent thinker Edgar Jung by the Nazis during the Night of the Long Knives in the following year. Many of them eventually rejected the antisemitic or the totalitarian nature of the Nazi regime, with the notable exception of Carl Schmitt and some others.

From the 1960–1970s onwards, the Conservative Revolution has largely influenced the European New Right, in particular the French &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; and the German &quot;Neue Rechte&quot;, and through them the contemporary European Identitarian movement.

== Name and definition ==
Although conservative essayists of the Weimar Republic like Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Hugo von Hofmannsthal or Edgar Jung had already described their political project as a &quot;Konservative Revolution&quot; (&quot;Conservative Revolution&quot;), the name saw a revival after the 1949 doctoral thesis of &quot;Neue Rechte&quot; philosopher Armin Mohler on the movement. Molher&#x27;s post-war ideological reconstruction of the &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; has been widely criticized by scholars, but the validity of a redefined concept of &quot;neo-conservative&quot; or &quot;new nationalist&quot; movement active during the Weimar period (1918–1933), whose lifetime is sometimes extended to the years 1890s–1910s, and which differed in particular from the &quot;old nationalism&quot; of the 19th century, is now generally accepted in scholarship.
The name &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; has appeared as a paradox, sometimes as a &quot;semantic absurdity&quot;, for many modern historians, and some of them have suggested &quot;neo-conservative&quot; as a more easily justifiable label for the movement. Sociologist Stefan Breuer wrote that he would have preferred the substitute &quot;new nationalism&quot; to name a charismatic and holistic cultural movement that differed from the &quot;old nationalism&quot; of the previous century, whose essential role was limited to the preservation of the German institutions and their influence in the world. Despite the apparent contradiction, however, the association of the terms &quot;Conservative&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; is justified in Moeller van den Bruck&#x27;s writings by his definition of the movement as a will to preserve eternal values while favouring at the same time the redesign of ideal and institutional forms in response to the &quot;insecurities of the modern world&quot;.

Historian Louis Dupeux, a specialist of the Conservative Revolution, saw the movement as an intellectual project with its own consistent logic, namely the striving for an &quot;Intellektueller Macht&quot; (&quot;intellectual power&quot;), if necessary via the use of modern technique and concepts, which would allow them to promote and gain wider support to conservative and revolutionary ideas directed against liberalism, egalitarianism, and traditional conservatism. This change of attitude, compared to 19th-century conservatism, is described as a &quot;Bejahung&quot; (&quot;affirmation&quot;) by Dupeux: Conservative Revolutionaries said &quot;yes&quot; to their time as long as they could find the ways to facilitate the resurgence of anti-liberal and what they saw as &quot;eternal values&quot; within modern societies. Dupeux conceded at the same time that the Conservative Revolution was rather a counter-cultural movement than an actual philosophical proposition, relying more on non-rationalistic &quot;feeling, images and myths&quot; than on scientific analysis and concepts. He also admitted the necessity to distinguish several leanings, sometimes with contradictory views, within its diverse ideological spectrum.
Political scientist Tamir Bar-On has defined the Conservative Revolution as a combination of &quot;German ultra-nationalism, defence of the organic folk community, technological modernity, and socialist revisionism, which perceived the worker and soldier as models for a reborn authoritarian state superseding the egalitarian &quot;decadence&quot; of liberalism, socialism, and traditional conservatism.&quot;

== Origin and development ==
The Conservative Revolution is encompassed in a larger and older counter-movement to the French Revolution of 1789, influenced by the anti-modernity and anti-rationalism of early 19th-century romanticism, in the context of a German, especially Prussian, &quot;tradition of militaristic, authoritarian nationalism which rejected liberalism, socialism, democracy and internationalism.&quot; Historian Fritz Stern described the movement as disoriented intellectuals plunged into a profound &quot;cultural despair&quot;: they felt alienated and uprooted within a world dominated by what they saw as &quot;bourgeois rationalism and science&quot;. Their hatred of modernity, Stern follows, led them to the naive confidence that all these modern evils could be fought and resolved by a &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot;.
Although terms such as &quot;Konservative Kraft&quot; (&quot;conservative power&quot;) and &quot;schöpferische Restauration&quot; (&quot;creative restoration&quot;) began to spread across German-speaking Europe from the 1900s to the 1920s, the &quot;Konservative Revolution&quot; (&quot;Conservative Revolution&quot;) became an established concept in the Weimar Republic (1918–1933) through the writings of essayists like Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Hermann Rauschning, Edgar Jung and Oswald Spengler.

The creation of the &quot;Alldeutscher Verband&quot; (&quot;Pan-German League&quot;) by Alfred Hugenberg in 1891 and the &quot;Jugendbewegung&quot; (&quot;youth movement&quot;) in 1896 are cited as conducive to the emergence of the Conservative Revolution in the following decades. Moeller van den Bruck was the dominant figure of the movement until his suicide on 30 May 1925. His ideas were initially spread through the &quot;Juniklub&quot; he had founded on 28 June 1919, on the day of the signing of Treaty of Versailles.

Conservative Revolutionaries frequently referred to German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche as their mentor and as the main intellectual influence on their movement. Despite Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy being often misinterpreted, or wrongly appropriated by thinkers of the Conservative Revolution, they retained his contempt for Christian ethics, democracy, modernity and egalitarianism as the cornerstone of their ideology. Historian Roger Woods writes that Conservative Revolutionaries &quot;constructed&quot;, in response to the war and the unstable Weimar period, a Nietzsche &quot;who advocated a self-justifying activism, unbridled self-assertion, war over peace, and the elevation of instinct over reason.&quot;

Many of the intellectuals involved in the movement were born in the last decades of the nineteenth century and experienced WWI as a formative event (&quot;Kriegserlebnis&quot;, &quot;war experience&quot;) for the foundation of their political beliefs. The life on the front line, with its violence and irrationality, caused most of them to search &quot;a posteriori&quot; for a meaning to what they had to endure during the conflict. Ernst Jünger is the major figure of that branch of the Conservative Revolution which wanted to uphold military structures and values in peacetime society, and saw in the community of front line comradeship (&quot;Frontgemeinschaft&quot;) the true nature of German socialism.

== Main thinkers ==
According to Armin Mohler and other sources, prominent members of the Conservative Revolution included:

== Ideology ==
Despite a broad range of political positions that historian Roger Woods has labelled the &quot;conservative dilemma&quot;, the German Conservative Revolution can be defined by its disapproval of:
* the traditional conservative values of the German Empire (1871–1918), including the egalitarian ethics of Christianity; and a rejection of the project of a restoration of the defunct Wilhelmine empire within its historical political and cultural structures,
* the political regime and commercialist culture of the Weimar Republic; and the parliamentary system and democracy in general, because the national community (&quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;) shall &quot;transcend the conventional divisions of left and right&quot;,
* the class analysis of socialism; with the defence of an anti-Marxist &quot;socialist revisionism&quot;; labelled by Oswald Spengler the &quot;socialism of the blood&quot;, it drew inspiration from the front line comradeship of World War I.

=== New nationalism and morality ===

Conservative Revolutionaries argued that their nationalism was fundamentally different from the precedent forms of German nationalism or conservatism. They condemned the reactionary outlook of traditional Wilhelmine conservatives and their failure to fully understand the emerging concepts of the modern world, such as technology, the city and the proletariat.

Moeller van den Bruck defined the Conservative Revolution as the will to conserve a set of values seen as inseparable from a &quot;Volk&quot; (&quot;people, ethnic group&quot;). These eternal values were able to survive through the fluctuations of the ages because of innovations in their institutional and ideal forms. Distant from the pure reactionary who, in Moeller van den Bruck&#x27;s eyes, does not create (and from the pure revolutionary who does nothing but destroys everything), the Conservative Revolutionary sought to give a form to phenomena in an eternal space, a shape that could guarantee their survival among the few things that cannot be lost:

Edgar Jung indeed dismissed the idea that true conservatives wanted to &quot;stop the wheel of history&quot;. The chivalric way of life they were seeking to achieve was, according to Oswald Spengler, not governed by any moral code, but rather by &quot;a noble, self-evident morality, based on that natural sense of tact which comes from good breeding&quot;. This morality was not the product of a conscious reflection, but rather &quot;something innate which one senses and which has its own organic logic.&quot; Conservative revolutionaries saw the values of morality as instinctive and eternal, and as such embodied in rural life. The latter became challenged, Spengler believed, by the rise of the artificial world of the city, where theories and observations were needed to understand life itself, either coming from liberal democrats or scientific socialists. What Conservative Revolutionaries were aiming to achieve was the restoration, within the modern world, of what they saw as natural laws and values:
Influenced by Nietzsche, most of them were opposed to the Christian ethics of solidarity and equality. Although many Conservative Revolutionaries described themselves as Protestant or Catholics, they saw Christian ethical premise as structurally indenturing the strong into mandatory, rather than optional, service to the weak. On a geopolitical scale, theorists of the movement adopted a vision of the world (&quot;Weltanschauung&quot;) where nations would abandon moral standards in their relationship to each others, only guided by their natural self-interest.
&quot;Völkischen&quot; were involved in a racialist and occultist movement dating back to the middle of the 19th century and had an influence on the Conservative Revolution. Their priority was the fight against Christianity and the return to a (reconstructed) Germanic pagan faith, or the &quot;Germanization&quot; of Christianity to purge it from foreign (Semitic) influence.

=== &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; and dictatorship ===

Thomas Mann believed that if German military resistance to the West during World War I was stronger than its spiritual resistance, it was primarily because the &quot;ethos&quot; (&quot;character&quot;) of the German &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;national community&quot;) cannot quickly express itself in words, and as a result is not able to counter effectively the solid rhetoric of the West. Since German culture was &quot;of the soul, something which could not be grasped by the intellect&quot;, the authoritarian state was the natural order desired by the German people. Politics, Mann argued, was inevitably a commitment to democracy and therefore alien to the German spirit:
While scholars have debated whether these formulations should be considered artistic and idealistic, or rather a serious attempt to draw a political analysis of that period, young Mann&#x27;s writings have been influential on many Conservative Revolutionaries. Mann was accused by the right of watering down his undemocratic views in 1922 after he removed some paragraphs from the republication of &quot;Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen&quot; (&quot;Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man&quot;), originally released in 1918. In a speech delivered the same year (&quot;On the German Republic&quot; []), Mann publicly became a staunch defender of the Weimar Republic and attacked many of the figures associated with the Conservative Revolution such as Oswald Spengler, whom he depicted as intellectually dishonest and irresponsibly immoral. In 1933, he described National Socialism as the &quot;politische Wirklichkeit jener konservativen Revolution&quot;, that is to say the &quot;political reality of that Conservative Revolution&quot;.

In 1921, Carl Schmitt published his essay &quot;Die Diktatur&quot; (&quot;The Dictatorship&quot;), in which he studied the foundations of the recently established Weimar Republic. Comparing what he saw as the effective and ineffective elements of the new constitution, he highlighted the office of the &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; as a valuable position, essentially due to the power granted to the president by the Article 48 to declare an &quot;Ausnahmezustand&quot; (&quot;state of emergency&quot;), which Schmitt implicitly praised as dictatorial.

Schmitt further advanced in &quot;Politische Theologie&quot; (1922) that there cannot be any functioning legal order without a sovereign authority. He defined sovereignty as the &quot;possibility&quot;, or the power, to &quot;decide&quot; on the triggering of a &quot;state of emergency&quot;, in other words a state of &quot;exception&quot; regarding the law: &quot;There is some person or institution, in a given polity, capable of bringing about a total suspension of the law and then to use extra-legal force to normalize the situation, then that person or institution is the sovereign in that polity.&quot; According to him, every government should include within its constitution that dictatorial possibility to allow, when necessary, for faster and more effective decisions than going through parliamentary discussion and compromise. Referring to Adolf Hitler, he later used in 1934 the following formulation to justify the legitimacy of the Night of the Long Knives: &quot;Der Führer schützt das Recht&quot; (&quot;The leader defends the law&quot;).

=== Front-line socialism ===
Conservative Revolutionaries asserted that they were not guided by the &quot;sterile resentment of the class struggle&quot;. Many of them invoked the community of front line comradeship (&quot;Frontgemeinschaft&quot;) of World War I as the model for the national community (&quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;) to follow in peaceful times, hoping in that project to transcend the established political categories of right and left. For that purpose, they tried to remove the concept of revolution from November 1918 in order to attach it to August 1914. Conservative Revolutionaries indeed painted the November Revolution, which led to the foundation of the Weimar Republic, as a betrayal of the true revolution and, at best, hunger protests by the mob.
The common agreement with socialists was the abolition of the excesses of capitalism. Jung claimed that, while the economy should remain in private hands, the &quot;greed of capital&quot; should at the same time be controlled, and that a community based on shared interests had to be set up between workers and employers. Another source of aversion for capitalism was rooted in the profits made from the war and inflation, and a last concern can be found in the fact that most of Conservative Revolutionaries belonged to the middle class, in which they felt crushed at the centre of an economic struggle between the ruling capitalists and the potentially dangerous masses.Although they dismissed communism as mere idealism, many of them showed their dependence on some Marxist terminology in their writings. For instance, Jung emphasized the &quot;historical inevitability&quot; of conservatism taking over from the liberal era, in a mirror-image of the historical materialism developed by Karl Marx. Spengler also wrote about the decline of the West as an ineluctable phenomenon, but his intention was to provide modern readers with a &quot;new socialism&quot; that would enable them to realize the meaninglessness of life, contrasting with Marx&#x27;s idea of the coming of paradise on earth. Above all, the Conservative Revolution drew influences from vitalism (Lebensphilosophie) and irrationalism, not from materialism. Spengler argued that the materialist vision of Marx was based on nineteenth-century science, while the twentieth century would be the age of psychology.
Along with Karl Otto Paetel and Heinrich Laufenberg, Ernst Niekisch was one of the main advocates of National Bolshevism, a minor branch of the Conservative Revolution described as the &quot;left-wing-people of the right&quot; (&quot;Linke Leute von rechts&quot;).&quot;&quot; They defended an ultra-nationalist form of socialism that took its roots in both &quot;Völkisch&quot; extremism and nihilistic &quot;Kulturpessimismus&quot;, rejecting any Western influence on German society: liberalism and democracy, capitalism and Marxism, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, Christianity and humanism. Niekisch and National Bolsheviks were even ready to build a temporary alliance with German communists and the Soviet Union in order to annihilate the capitalist West.

== Currents ==
In his PhD thesis supervised by Karl Jaspers, Armin Mohler distinguished five currents inside the nebula of the Conservative Revolution: the &quot;Jungkonservativen&quot; (&quot;young conservatives&quot;), the &quot;Nationalrevolutionäre&quot; (&quot;national revolutionaries&quot;), the &quot;Völkischen&quot; (from the &quot;folkish movement&quot;), the &quot;Bündischen&quot; (&quot;leaguists&quot;) and the &quot;Landvolksbewegung&quot; (&quot;rural people&#x27;s movement&quot;). According to Mohler, the last two groups were less theory- and more action-oriented, the &quot;Landvolks&quot; movement offering concrete resistance in the form of demonstrations and tax boycotts.

French historian Louis Dupeux saw five lines of divisions that can be drawn inside the Conservative Revolutionaries: the small farmers were different from the cultural pessimists and the &quot;pseudo-moderns&quot;, who belonged for the most part to the middle class; while the proponent of an &quot;organic&quot; society diverged from those of an &quot;organized&quot; society. A third division split the supporters of deep and lengthy political and cultural transformations from those who endorsed a quick and erupting social revolution, as far as challenging economic freedom and private property. The fourth rift resided in the question of the &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot; (&quot;drive to the East&quot;) and the attitude to adopt towards Bolshevik Russia, escorted by a debate on the place of Germany between a so-called &quot;senile&quot; West and &quot;young and barbaric&quot; Orient; the last division being a deep opposition between the &quot;Völkischen&quot; and the pre-fascist thinkers.

In 1995, historian Rolf Peter Sieferle described what he labelled five &quot;complexes&quot; in the Conservative Revolution: the &quot;völkischen&quot;, the &quot;national socialists&quot;, the &quot;revolutionary nationalists&quot; as such, the &quot;vital-activists&quot; (&quot;aktivistisch-vitalen&quot;), and, a minority in the movement, the &quot;biological naturalists&quot;.

Building on the previous studies conducted by Mohler and Dupeux, French political scientist Stéphane François summarized the three main currents within the Conservative Revolution, this broad division being the most widely shared among analysts of the movement:
* the &quot;young conservatives&quot; (&quot;Jungkonservativen&quot;);
* the &quot;national revolutionaries&quot; (&quot;Nationalrevolutionäre&quot;);
* the &quot;Völkischen&quot; (from the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement).

=== Young conservatives ===

&quot;Young conservatives&quot; were deeply influenced by 19th-century intellectual and aesthetic movements such as German romanticism and &quot;Kulturpessimismus&quot; (&quot;cultural pessimism&quot;). Contrary to traditional Wilhelmine conservatives, &quot;Jungkonservativen&quot; aimed at assisting the re-emergence of &quot;persistent and fundamental structures&quot;—authority, the state, the community, the nation, the people—while &quot;espousing their times&quot; in the very same movement.

Moeller van den Bruck tried to overcome the &quot;Kulturpessimismus&quot; dilemma by fighting decadency to build a new political order over it. In 1923, he published the influential book &quot;Das Dritte Reich&quot; (&quot;The Third Reich&quot;)&quot;,&quot; in which he went further from theoretical analysis to introduce a practical revolutionary programme as a remedy to the political situation: a &quot;Third Reich&quot; that would unite all classes under an authoritarian rule based on a combination of the nationalism of the right and the socialism of the left.

Rejecting both the nation-state narrowed to one unified people and the imperialistic structure based on different ethnic groups, the goal of &quot;Jungkonservativen&quot; was to fulfil the &quot;Volksmission&quot; (&quot;mission of the Volk&quot;) through the edification of a new Reich, i.e. &quot;the organization of all the peoples in a supra-state, dominated by a superior principle, under the supreme responsibility of only one people&quot; in the words of Armin Mohler. As summarized by Edgar Jung in 1933:
Although Moeller van der Bruck killed himself in despair in May 1925, his ideas continued to influence his contemporaries. Among them was Edgar Jung, who advocated the creation of a corporatist organic state, free from class struggle and parliamentary democracy, which would make way for a return to the spirit of the Middle Ages with a new Holy Roman Empire federating central Europe. The theme of a return to medieval values and aesthetics among &quot;young conservatives&quot; was inherited from a Romantic fascination for that period, which they believed to be simpler and more integrated than the modern world. Oswald Spengler praised medieval chivalry as the philosophical and moral attitude to adopt against a modern decadent spirit. Jung perceived this return as a gradual and lengthy transformation, similar to the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, rather than a sudden revolutionary eruption like the French Revolution.

=== National revolutionaries ===

Other Conservative Revolutionaries rather drew influence from their life at the front line (, &quot;war experience&quot;) during the First World War. Far from the concern of the &quot;young conservatives&quot;, Ernst Jünger and the other &quot;national revolutionaries&quot; advocated total acceptance of modern technique and endorsed the use of any modern phenomena that could help them overcome modernity—such as propaganda or mass organizations—and eventually achieve a new political order. The latter would have been based on life itself rather than the intellect, founded on organic, naturally structured and hierarchical communities, and led by a new aristocracy of merit and action. Historian Jeffrey Herf used the term &quot;reactionary modernism&quot; to describe that &quot;great enthusiasm for modern technology with a rejection of the Enlightenment and the values and institutions of liberal democracy&quot;.
Jünger supported the emergence of a young intellectual elite that would spring out from the trenches of WWI, ready to oppose bourgeois capitalism and to embody a new nationalist revolutionary spirit. In the 1920s, he wrote more than 130 articles in various nationalist magazines, mostly in or, less frequently, in , the National-Bolshevik publication of Ernst Niekisch. However, as Dupeux pointed out, Jünger wanted to use nationalism as an &quot;explosive&quot; and not as an &quot;absolute&quot;, to eventually let the new order arise by itself. The association of Jünger to the Conservative Revolutionaries is still a matter of debate among scholars.

The entry of Germany in the League of Nations in 1926 participated in radicalizing the revolutionary wing of the movement during the late 1920s. The event was seen as a &quot;sign of a Western orientation&quot; in a country Conservative Revolutionaries had conceived as the future (&quot;Empire of Central Europe&quot;).

=== &quot;Völkischen&quot; ===
The adjective &quot;völkisch&quot; derives from the German concept of &quot;Volk&quot; (cognate with English &quot;folk&quot;), which has overtones of &quot;nation&quot;, &quot;race&quot; and &quot;tribe&quot;. The &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement emerged in the mid-19th century, influenced by German Romanticism. Erected on the concept of &quot;Blut und Boden&quot; (&quot;blood and soil&quot;), it was a racialist, populist, agrarian, romantic nationalist and, from the 1900s, an antisemitic movement. According to Armin Mohler, the &quot;Völkischen&quot; aimed at opposing the &quot;process of desegregation&quot; that was threatening the &quot;Volk&quot; by providing him means to generate a consciousness of itself.

Influenced by authors like Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936), Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), and Ludwig Woltmann (1871–1907), the &quot;Völkischen&quot; had conceptualised a racialist and hierarchical definition of human peoples where Aryans (or Germans) were set at the summit of the &quot;white race&quot;. But while they used terms like &quot;Nordische Rasse&quot; (&quot;Nordic race&quot;) and &quot;Germanentum&quot; (&quot;Germanic peoples&quot;), their concept of &quot;Volk&quot; could also be more flexible and understood as a &quot;Gemeinsame Sprache&quot; (&quot;common language&quot;), or as an &quot;Ausdruck einer Landschaftsseele&quot; (&quot;expression of a landscape&#x27;s soul&quot;) in the words of geographer Ewald Banse. The &quot;Völkischen&quot; indeed idealized the myth of an &quot;original nation&quot;–which they thought could still be found in German rural regions–organised as a form of &quot;primitive democracy freely subjected to their natural elites.&quot; The notion of &quot;people&quot; (&quot;Volk&quot;) subsequently turned into the idea of a birth-giving and eternal entity among &quot;Völkischen&quot;—in the same way as they would have written on &quot;the Nature&quot;—rather than a sociological category.

The political agitation and uncertainty that followed WWI nourished a fertile background for the renewed success of various &quot;Völkisch&quot; sects that were abundant in Berlin at the time. The &quot;Völkischen&quot; became significant by the number of groups during the Weimar Republic, although they were not so by the number of adherents. Some &quot;Völkischen&quot; tried to revive what they believed to be a true German faith (&quot;Deutschglaube&quot;), by resurrecting the cult of ancient Germanic gods. Various occult movements such as Ariosophy were connected to &quot;Völkisch&quot; theories, and artistic circles were largely present among the &quot;Völkischen&quot;, such as the painters Ludwig Fahrenkrog (1867–1952) and Fidus (1868–1948). By May 1924, Wilhelm Stapel perceived the movement as capable of embracing and reconciling the whole nation: in his view, &quot;Vökischen&quot; had an idea to spread instead of a party programme, and they were led by &quot;heroes&quot; rather than &quot;calculating politicians&quot;.

Mohler listed the following figures as belonging to the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement: Theodor Fritsch, Otto Ammon, Willibald Hentschel, Guido von List, Erich Ludendorff, Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels, Herman Wirth, and Ernst Graf zu Reventlow.

== Relationship to Nazism ==

Despite a significant intellectual legacy in common, the disparate movement cannot be easily conflated with Nazism. Their anti-democratic and militaristic thoughts certainly participated in making the idea of an authoritarian regime acceptable to the semi-educated middle-class, and even to the educated youth, but Conservative Revolutionary writings did not have a decisive influence on National Socialist ideology. Historian Helga Grebing indeed reminds that &quot;the question of the susceptibility to and preparation for National Socialism is not the same as the question of the roots and ideological precursors of National Socialism&quot;. This ambiguous relationship has led scholars to characterize the movement as a form of &quot;German pre-fascism&quot; or &quot;non-Nazi fascism&quot;.

During the rise of power of the Nazi party in the 1920s up until the early 1930s, some thinkers seem to have shown, as historian Roger Woods writes, &quot;a blindness towards the true nature of the Nazis&quot;, while their unresolved political dilemma and failure to define the content of a new German regime led to the absence of widely supported alternative propositions from the right, and eventually to a lack of resistance to the Nazi seizure of power. According to historian Fritz Stern, &quot;despite some misgivings about Hitler&#x27;s demagogy, many conservative revolutionaries saw in the &quot;Führer&quot; the sole possibility of achieving their goal. In the sequel, Hitler&#x27;s triumph shattered the illusions of most of Moeller&#x27;s followers, and the twelve years of the Third Reich witnessed the separation of conservative revolution and national socialism again&quot;.

After a few months of adulation in the aftermath of their decisive electoral victory, the Nazis disavowed Moeller van den Bruck and denied that he had been a forerunner of National Socialism: his &quot;unrealistic ideology&quot;, as they said in 1939, had &quot;nothing to do with the actual historical developments or with sober &quot;Realpolitik&quot;&quot; and Hitler &quot;was &quot;not&quot; Moeller&#x27;s heir&quot;. When taken individually, Conservative Revolutionaries often held ambivalent views of the Nazis, but many of them eventually rejected Nazism and the Nazi party after they seized power in 1933, either owing to its totalitarian or antisemitic character (the &quot;opponents&quot;), or because there would have preferred another form of authoritarian or totalitarian regime (the &quot;competitors&quot;). Stern summarized the relationship in those terms:
=== Opponents ===
Many Conservative Revolutionaries, while keeping on opposing liberalism and still adhering to the notion of a &quot;strong leader&quot;, rejected the totalitarian or the antisemitic nature of the Nazi regime. Martin Niemöller, initially a supporter of Adolf Hitler, opposed the Nazification of German Protestant churches in 1934, as well as the Nazis&#x27; Aryan Paragraph. Despite having made remarks about Jews that some scholars have called antisemitic, he was a leader of the anti-Nazi Confessing Church.

Rudolf Pechel and Friedrich Hielscher openly opposed the Nazi regime, while Thomas Mann went into exile in 1939 and broadcast anti-Nazi speeches to the German people via the BBC during the war. Ernst Jünger refused a seat in the Reichstag for the Nazi party both in 1927 and in 1933, despised the &quot;blood and soil&quot; doctrine, and his house was raided several times by the Gestapo. Hermann Rauschning and Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus sought refuge abroad to keep on opposing the regime. Georg Quabbe refused to collaborate with the Nazis as a lawyer. Shortly before his death in 1936, Oswald Spengler prophesied that &quot;in ten years, a German Reich [would] probably no longer exist&quot; (&quot;Da ja wohl in zehn Jahren ein Deutsches Reich nicht mehr existieren wird!&quot;). In his private papers, he denounced Nazi anti-Semitism in strong terms:
Others such as Claus von Stauffenberg remained inside the Reichswehr and later in the Wehrmacht to silently conspire in the 20 July plot of 1944. Fritz Stern stated that it was &quot;a tribute to the genuine spiritual quality of the conservative revolution that the reality of the Third Reich aroused many of them to opposition, sometimes silent, often open and costly. [...] In the final plot against Hitler, in July 1944, a few former conservative revolutionaries risked and lost their lives, martyr to the genuine idealism of their earlier cause.&quot;

=== Competitors ===

Some Conservative Revolutionaries did not reject the fascist nature of Nazi rule &quot;per se&quot;, but would have preferred an alternative authoritarian State. They were often murdered or imprisoned for their deviation from the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;.

Edgar Jung, a leading figure of the Conservative Revolution, was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives by the SS of Heinrich Himmler, who wanted to prevent competitive nationalist ideas from opposing or deviating from Hitler&#x27;s doctrine. For many Conservative Revolutionaries, this event ended the ambivalence between them and the Nazis. Jung promoted a collectivist version of the Conservative Revolution, speaking of nations as being singular organic entities, attacking individualism while praising militarism and war. He also supported &quot;total mobilization&quot; of human and industrial resources, while promoting the productive power of modernity, similar to the futurism espoused by Italian Fascism.

Ernst Niekisch, although anti-Jewish and in favour of a totalitarian state, rejected Adolf Hitler as he felt he lacked any real socialism, and instead found in Joseph Stalin his model for the Führer Principle. He was interned in a concentration camp from 1937 to 1945 for his criticism of the regime. August Winnig, initially welcoming the Nazis in 1933, opposed the Third Reich for his neo-pagan tendencies. Despite a best-selling essay published in 1937 defending fascism and strongly tainted by antisemitism, but that diverged from the official Nazi doctrine on race, he was left alone by the Nazis due to Winnig remaining mostly silent during the rule of Hitler.

=== Collaborators ===

Regarded as the &quot;crown jurist of the Third Reich&quot;, Carl Schmitt remained unrepentant even after 1945 for his role in the creation of the Nazi state. Although he considered Adolf Hitler too vulgar, Schmitt was party to the burning of books by Jewish authors, rejoicing in the destruction of &quot;un-German&quot; and &quot;anti-German&quot; material, and calling for a much more extensive purge, to include works by authors influenced by Jewish ideas.

Hans Freyer was the head of the German Institute for Culture in Budapest from 1938 to 1944. Together with Nazi historian Walter Frank, Freyer established a racist and anti-semitic &quot;völkisch&quot; historiography during that period. Wilhelm Stapel joined the &quot;Deutschen Christen&quot; in July 1933, spoke vehemently against the anti-Nazi Confessing Church of Martin Niemöller and Karl Barth and advocated for the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in the Church. At the same time Stapel was committed to the policy of Reichsminister of Church Affairs (&quot;Reichskirchenminister&quot;) Hanns Kerrl, to whom he served as an advisor. However, under pressure from the Nazi leadership in 1938, he had to stop the publication of his monthly magazine &quot;Deutsches Volkstum&quot;.

== Study and debate ==
The precursor of academic studies of the Conservative Revolution was the French historian Edmond Vermeil, who published in 1938 an essay entitled &quot;Doctrinaires de la révolution allemande 1918–1938&quot; (&quot;Doctrinarians of the German revolution 1918–1938&quot;). In the first decades that followed the end of WWII, most of the political theorists who studied the Conservative Revolution and became specialists of the subject were far-right thinkers deeply influenced by Conservative Revolutionary thinkers, such as Armin Mohler and Alain de Benoist. It was not until the 1980–1990s that academic research on the movement began to spread more globally across the political spectrum, mostly due to its controversial relationship with Nazism and later influence on the post-war European New Right.

=== Post-war revival after Armin Mohler ===
The contemporary concept of a &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; was retrospectively reconstructed after WWII by Neue Richt philosopher Armin Mohler in his 1949 doctoral thesis &quot;Die Konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918–1932&quot;, written under the supervision of Karl Jaspers. Mohler called Conservative Revolutionaries the &quot;Trotskyites of the German Revolution&quot;, and his appropriation of the concept has been recurrently accused of being a biased attempt to reconstruct a pre-WWII far-right movement acceptable in a post-fascist Europe, by downplaying the influence some of these thinkers had on the rise of Nazism. Subtitled &quot;a handbook&quot;, the study was conceived, in the words of historian Roger Griffin, &quot;as a survivalist manual for those who do not wish to lose their spiritual bearings in the present age&quot;. Mohler believed that the project of the &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; had only been postponed by the Nazi seizure of power. He was also at that time the secretary of Ernst Jünger, who had been a major figure of the movement.

During the 1970s, thinkers of the Conservative Revolution were influencing new radical right movements, including the French Nouvelle Droite, led by Alain de Benoist. Some academics, especially in West Germany, took a new interest in the subject and began to suspect Mohler&#x27;s study for his political closeness to the concept. The reactionary and anti-modern characters of the &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; were largely emphasised during that decade, and the movement was seen as nothing more than a fertile ground for Nazism, speaking &quot;the same totalitarian languages&quot;.

German-American historian Fritz Stern used the term &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; in his 1961 book &quot;The Politics of Cultural Despair&quot; to describe the life and ideas of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, and rather drew attention to the alienation and &quot;cultural despair&quot; these authors experienced in the nascent modern world, which led them to express such radical ideas in response. Stern grouped, however, Moeller van den Bruck into a larger &quot;Germanic ideology&quot;, along with earlier thinkers from the late 19th century like Paul de Lagarde and Julius Langbehn.

=== Academic research since the 1980s ===
In a 1981 symposium entitled &quot;Conservative revolution and modernity&quot;, French historian Louis Dupeux pointed out that what Mohler had called the &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; was in reality neither truly reactionary nor totally anti-modern (they could even show optimism towards the modern world). This analysis was supported three years later by American historian Jeffrey Herf in his book &quot;Reactionary Modernism&quot;, which highlighted the acceptance of modern technique besides a rejection of liberal democracy among conservative thinkers of that period. Dupeux also stressed that Conservative Revolutionaries were not only opposed to the &quot;two forms of progressivism&quot;, namely liberalism and Marxism, but also to the &quot;cultural pessimism&quot; of the reactionary and conservative right, a standoff they attempted to overcome by proposing an innovative form of reactionary regimes that could espouse the new frameworks of the modern world.

In his 1993 book &quot;Anatomie der Konservativen Revolution&quot; (&quot;Anatomy of the Conservative Revolution&quot;), German sociologist Stefan Breuer rejected Mohler&#x27;s definition of the term &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot;, defining &quot;conservatism&quot; as the aspiration to conserve the structures of feudal Germany, in fact, a political project already moribund during the Weimar period. The &quot;Conservative Revolution&quot; constructed by Mohler was, in his view, the mirror-image of an emerging modern society that took conscious of the deadlocks and dangers of a &quot;simple modernity&quot; built on science and technique only. While noting the complexity that would imply an intellectual classification of that period, Breuer stated that he would have preferred the substitute &quot;new nationalism&quot; to designate a more charismatic and holistic version of the German right-wing movements, contrasting with the &quot;old nationalism&quot; of the 19th century, a current which had essentially been aiming at preserving traditional institutions and German influence in the world.

In 1996, British historian Roger Woods recognized the validity of the concept, while stressing the eclectic character of the movement and their inability to form a common agenda, a political deadlock he labelled the &quot;conservative dilemma&quot;. Woods described the Conservative Revolution as &quot;ideas which cannot simply be explained and summarised as if they were a political programme, but rather as expressions of tension&quot;. Regarding the ambiguous relationship with Nazism, downplayed by Mohler in his 1949 thesis and accentuated by 1970s analysts, Woods argued that &quot;regardless of individual Conservative Revolutionary criticisms of the Nazis, the deeper commitment to activism, strong leadership, hierarchy and a disregard for political programmes persists. [...] Unresolved political dilemmas result in an activism and an interest in hierarchy which mean that there can be no fundamental objection to the National Socialist assumption of power.&quot;

Historian Ishay Landa has described the nature of the Conservative Revolution&#x27;s &quot;socialism&quot; as decidedly capitalist. Landa points out that Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;Prussian Socialism&quot; strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and &quot;wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes&quot;. Landa describes Spengler&#x27;s &quot;Prussian Socialism&quot; as &quot;working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but — and this is a vital aspect — being happy about it.&quot; Landa likewise describes Arthur Moeller van den Bruck as a &quot;socialist champion of capitalism&quot; who praised free trade, flourishing markets, the creative value of the entrepreneur, and the capitalist division of labor, and sought to emulate British and French imperialism. Landa notes the similarities of Moeller&#x27;s critiques of socialism with those of neoliberals such as Friedrich von Hayek and writes that &quot;far from hostile to the bourgeois spirit, Moeller&#x27;s text is suffused with such spirit.&quot;

== Later influence ==
The movement influenced contemporary thinkers outside of German-speaking Europe. Among them, the Italian philosopher Julius Evola is often associated with the Conservative Revolution.

The Nouvelle Droite, a French far-right philosophical movement created in the 1960s to adapt traditionalist, ethnopluralist and illiberal politics to the European post-WWII context and to distance itself from earlier forms of far-right like fascism, mainly through a project of pan-European nationalism have been deeply influenced by the Conservative Revolution, as well as its German counterpart the Neue Rechte.

The ideology and theoretical structure of the Identitarian movement is mainly inspired by the Nouvelle Droite, the Neue Rechte, and through them by the Conservative Revolution.

==Cultural Depiction==
Conservative Revolution was emphatically depicted in the German TV Series Babylon Berlin.

<text>Clifford (Clif) Brian Evans (May 16, 1948 – May 6, 2022) was a Canadian politician. He represented the former Interlake electoral district in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 1999.

Before entering political life, Evans worked for ten years in the hotel business and twelve years in the oil and chemical plant industry. He was elected Mayor of Riverton, Manitoba in October 1989, and held the position until his election to the provincial legislature the following year.

Evans was elected as a New Democrat in the provincial election of 1990, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Ed Trachuk in the mid-northern riding of Interlake by about 400 votes. The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Evans sat in the Official Opposition.

The Progressive Conservatives again nominated Trachuk against Evans for the provincial election of 1995, but of greater long-term significance was the candidacy of Darryl Sutherland, from Independent Native Voice (a group which purported to represent aboriginal interests in the region). A government inquiry would subsequently establish that Sutherland&#x27;s candidacy had been encouraged, financed and organized by leading figures in the riding&#x27;s Progressive Conservative network, in the hopes that Sutherland would take enough votes away from the NDP to allow a PC victory (the aboriginal communities of northern Manitoba have generally supported the NDP, at least since the early 1970s).

As it happened, this attempted vote-splitting was unsuccessful and Evans was re-elected by a greater margin than before. Sutherland&#x27;s 289 votes were not enough to make a difference in the outcome, and most of the riding&#x27;s aboriginal voters supported Evans (who had, in fact, been publicly endorsed by the chiefs of the eight Interlake First Nations).

Evans had heard rumours about Sutherland&#x27;s candidacy during the campaign (in fact, some suspicions were raised in the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; shortly before election day). He did not raise the issue himself during the campaign, although former NDP cabinet minister Bill Uruski and other figures within the party conducted some investigations on the matter.

In early 1998, Evans and fellow NDP MLA Tim Sale received information that leading PC organizer Taras Sokolyk had played a role in encouraging INV candidates in the previous election. According to Doug Smith&#x27;s &quot;As Many Liars&quot; (a literary overview of the scandal), Evans was able to confirm this information through a discussion with Allan Aitken, a PC organizer in the region (who had previously been among Evans&#x27;s personal friends). Under pressure from the NDP caucus and some elements of the media, Premier Gary Filmon called a public inquiry into the scandal, which found that Sutherland&#x27;s candidacy had been encouraged by Progressive Conservative interests with the intention of causing vote-splitting.

Ironically, Evans&#x27;s own career was damaged by the scandal inquiry. The PCs raised concerns about connections between Evans and Sale and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which had publicized the story in early 1998. The government also attempted to show inconsistencies in Evans&#x27;s statements to the legislature on the subject (as to whether or not he believed there were &quot;two Tory campaigns&quot; in the riding). These allegations were not particularly serious, but the attacks on his credibility seem to have played a role in Evans&#x27;s decision not to seek re-election in 1999. He has not re-entered public life since this time.

Evans supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to lead the federal New Democratic Party in 1995.

<text>Antoine de Févin (ca. 1470 – late 1511 or early 1512) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance. He was active at the same time as Josquin des Prez, and shares many traits with his more famous contemporary.

==Life==
Févin was most likely born in Arras in Northern France, the son of an alderman. His brother Robert de Févin was also a composer. Most likely Antoine left Arras in the late 1480s, though there is no evidence that he went to Italy, the commonest destination for Franco-Flemish composers of the time. In the 1490s it is likely he became a priest (although there is no known documentation of that today), and he also may have obtained a master&#x27;s degree at a university, since he is commonly known as &quot;maistre&quot; later in his life. By 1507, he was working as a singer and composer in the chapelle royale for Louis XII of France, who praised him highly. He died at Blois.

The Swiss music theorist and biographer Heinrich Glarean, writing in 1547, noted that Févin was a follower of Josquin, and that he died young; he also mentioned him as being a composer of Orleans, though this most likely referred to the association of that city with the court of Louis XII.

==Works==
All of Févin&#x27;s surviving music is vocal. He wrote masses, motets and chansons. Stylistically his music is similar to Josquin&#x27;s in its clarity of texture and design, and its relatively progressive nature: Févin evidently wrote in the most current styles, adopting the method of contrasting imitative sections with homophonic sections which came into prominence around 1490. Unlike Josquin, he was less concerned with the careful setting of text than with formal structure; his setting of individual words is occasionally clumsy, though his larger-scale structures are easy to follow. He also particularly liked the device of using vocal duets to contrast with the full sonority of the choir.

Some of Févin&#x27;s music uses the technique of free contrapuntal fantasy, later perfected by Josquin, where strict imitation is absent; fragments of a cantus firmus pervade the texture, giving a feeling of overall unity and complete equality of all the voices.

Of his music, 14 masses (one of which is a Requiem Mass), 3 lamentations, 3 Magnificats, 14 motets and 17 chansons survive.

<text>Mary Ellen Spear Smith (October 11, 1863 – May 3, 1933) was a politician in British Columbia, Canada. She was the first female Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, and both the first female cabinet minister and the first female Acting Speaker and the first woman cabinet minister in the British Empire.

==Early life==
Smith was born Mary Ellen Spear in Tavistock, Devon, England. Her mother was Mary Spear and father, Richard Spear, was a copper miner. She became a school teacher before marrying Ralph Smith, a widower, coal miner and unionist, in 1883. The couple had five children together, one daughter and four sons. She moved with him to British Columbia in the early 1891 shortly after their marriage, settling first in Nanaimo and then moving to Vancouver in 1911.

==Career==

She was an activist as a member of the Suffrage League of Canada, member of the Dominion Board of Mental Hygiene, president of the Women&#x27;s Canadian Club and of the Women&#x27;s Forum, regent of the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire, and an executive member of the Canadian Red Cross. She also raised money for war veterans, and helped establish factories to employ blind children. She founded the &quot;Laurier Liberal Club&quot;, and was an active Methodist.

Her husband, Ralph Smith, was a moderate trade union leader. He was elected to the BC legislature in 1898. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1900 federal election. He returned to the BC legislature, and became British Columbia&#x27;s Minister of Finance in 1916. Mary Ellen Smith helped her husband&#x27;s political career by campaigning for him and making speeches on his behalf when he was unavailable.

Ralph Smith died in February 1917, and Mary Ellen Smith ran to succeed him as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vancouver in a January 1918 by-election. She ran as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; on the slogan &quot;Women and children first&quot;. She was elected by a wide margin, becoming the first woman in the BC Legislature.

She said in a speech in the Legislature that &quot;Not only did the women of my fair city stand behind me... but the men were there, too.&quot;

She was re-elected as a Liberal candidate in the 1920 and 1924 general elections.

As a legislator, she introduced the Minimum Wage Act of 1918, a law establishing a minimum wage for women of $12.77 per week. Smith helped enact laws establishing juvenile courts, allowing women to sit as judges, and passing laws protecting women in the workplace. She also worked to pass the Mothers&#x27; Pension Act in 1924, later renamed the Mothers&#x27; Allowances Act in 1937. This act provided divorced, deserted or widowed wives with guaranteed monthly income to raise children under the age of sixteen.

Smith also supported anti-Asian and eugenicist politics in British Columbia, including the Women and Girls’ Protection Act of 1923, which restricted their employment by Asians. She also advocated the sterilization of the feeble-minded lest their reproduction contribute to ‘race suicide’. She accepted the racial science of her day that justified legislation efforts to &quot;protect our own [Anglo-Canadian] race.&quot; (as cited in Kerwin, 1999, p. 95). By embracing racism and eugenics within her feminism, Smith reflected the ideals of feminists of her era.

She joined the cabinet of Premier John Oliver in 1921 as minister without portfolio, but resigned after eight months as she felt that the rules of cabinet solidarity restricted her independence and she was never assigned to a dedicated portfolio.

On February 22, 1928 she served as Acting Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the first woman to hold the position of Speaker in the British Empire. She was defeated in the 1928 election that brought down the Liberal government. For that election, she left her Vancouver riding and ran instead in the riding of Esquimalt on Vancouver Island.

In 1929, she was appointed Canada&#x27;s delegate to the International Labour Organization conference in Geneva.

She served as president of the BC Liberal Party in the early 1930s until her death due to a stroke in 1933 at the age of 72.

==Legacy==
Smith&#x27;s work to promote the rights of women and girls has been commemorated in feminist literature and in the public after her death, but her links to eugenics and anti-Asian policies were largely downplayed until recent decades.

In 2007, Smith was named a National Historic Person by the government of Canada. In Nanaimo the street Mary Ellen Drive, located between Dover Bay Road and the Island Highway, is named in her honour.

Mary Ellen Smith is also commemorated by the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia recognizing her as the first female MLA in British Columbia, the first female to be appointed a minister without portfolio in the British Empire, and as a campaigner for women&#x27;s rights.

<text>A triangulation of a set of points formula_1 in the Euclidean space formula_2 is a simplicial complex that covers the convex hull of formula_1, and whose vertices belong to formula_1. In the plane (when formula_1 is a set of points in formula_6), triangulations are made up of triangles, together with their edges and vertices. Some authors require that all the points of formula_1 are vertices of its triangulations. In this case, a triangulation of a set of points formula_1 in the plane can alternatively be defined as a maximal set of non-crossing edges between points of formula_1. In the plane, triangulations are special cases of planar straight-line graphs.

A particularly interesting kind of triangulations are the Delaunay triangulations. They are the geometric duals of Voronoi diagrams. The Delaunay triangulation of a set of points formula_1 in the plane contains the Gabriel graph, the nearest neighbor graph and the minimal spanning tree of formula_1.

Triangulations have a number of applications, and there is an interest to find the &quot;good&quot; triangulations of a given point set under some criteria as, for instance minimum-weight triangulations. Sometimes it is desirable to have a triangulation with special properties, e.g., in which all triangles have large angles (long and narrow (&quot;splinter&quot;) triangles are avoided).

Given a set of edges that connect points of the plane, the problem to determine whether they contain a triangulation is NP-complete.

== Regular triangulations ==
Some triangulations of a set of points formula_12 can be obtained by lifting the points of formula_1 into formula_14 (which amounts to add a coordinate formula_15 to each point of formula_1), by computing the convex hull of the lifted set of points, and by projecting the lower faces of this convex hull back on formula_2. The triangulations built this way are referred to as the regular triangulations of formula_1. When the points are lifted to the paraboloid of equation formula_19, this construction results in the Delaunay triangulation of formula_1. Note that, in order for this construction to provide a triangulation, the lower convex hull of the lifted set of points needs to be simplicial. In the case of Delaunay triangulations, this amounts to require that no formula_21 points of formula_1 lie in the same sphere.

== Combinatorics in the plane ==
Every triangulation of any set formula_1 of formula_24 points in the plane has formula_25 triangles and formula_26 edges where formula_27 is the number of points of formula_1 in the boundary of the convex hull of formula_1. This follows from a straightforward Euler characteristic argument.

== Algorithms to build triangulations in the plane ==
Triangle Splitting Algorithm : Find the convex hull of the point set formula_1 and triangulate this hull as a polygon. Choose an interior point and draw edges to the three vertices of the triangle that contains it. Continue this process until all interior points are exhausted.

Incremental Algorithm : Sort the points of formula_1 according to x-coordinates. The first three points determine a triangle. Consider the next point formula_32 in the ordered set and connect it with all previously considered points formula_33 which are visible to p. Continue this process of adding one point of formula_1 at a time until all of formula_1 has been processed.

== Time complexity of various algorithms ==

The following table reports time complexity results for the construction of triangulations of point sets in the plane, under different optimality criteria, where formula_24 is the number of points.

<text>The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism is a 1975 book by physicist Fritjof Capra. A bestseller in the United States, it has been translated into 23 languages. Capra summarized his motivation for writing the book: “Science does not need mysticism and mysticism does not need science. But man needs both.”

==Origin==
According to the preface of the first edition, reprinted in subsequent editions, Capra struggled to reconcile theoretical physics and Eastern mysticism and was at first &quot;helped on my way by &#x27;power plants&#x27;&quot; or psychedelics, with the first experience &quot;so overwhelming that I burst into tears, at the same time, not unlike Castaneda, pouring out my impressions to a piece of paper&quot;. (p. 12, 4th ed.)

Capra later discussed his ideas with Werner Heisenberg in 1972, as he mentioned in the following interview excerpt:

I had several discussions with Heisenberg. I lived in England then [circa 1972], and I visited him several times in Munich and showed him the whole manuscript chapter by chapter. He was very interested and very open, and he told me something that I think is not known publicly because he never published it. He said that he was well aware of these parallels. While he was working on quantum theory he went to India to lecture and was a guest of Tagore. He talked a lot with Tagore about Indian philosophy. Heisenberg told me that these talks had helped him a lot with his work in physics, because they showed him that all these new ideas in quantum physics were in fact not all that crazy. He realized there was, in fact, a whole culture that subscribed to very similar ideas. Heisenberg said that this was a great help for him. Niels Bohr had a similar experience when he went to China.

Bohr adopted the yin yang symbol as part of his coat of arms when he was knighted in 1947; it is claimed in the book that it was a result of orientalist influences.

&quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; was followed by other books of the same genre like &quot;The Hidden Connection&quot;, &quot;The Turning Point&quot; and &quot;The Web of Life&quot; in which Capra extended the argument of how Eastern mysticism and scientific findings of today relate, and how Eastern mysticism might also have the linguistic and philosophical tools required to undertake to some of the biggest scientific challenges remaining.

==Afterword to the third edition==
In the afterword to the third edition (published in 1982, pp 360–368 of the 1991 edition) Capra offers six suggestions for a new paradigm in science.

* Consider the part and the whole as more symmetrically conditioning one another.
* Replace thinking in terms of structure with thinking in terms of process.
* Replace ‘objective science’ with ‘epistemic science’, where the approach to decide what counts as knowledge adapts to the subject studied.
* Replace the idea of knowledge as buildings based on foundations with an idea of knowledge as networks.
* Abandon the quest for truth with a quest for better approximations. 
* Abandon the ideas of domination of nature with one of cooperation and nonviolence.

Capra reconnects this new paradigm to the theories of living and self-organizing systems that has emerged from cybernetics. Here he quotes Ilya Prigogine, Gregory Bateson, Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela (p. 372 of the 1991 edition).

==Acclaim and criticism==
According to Capra, Werner Heisenberg was in agreement with the main idea of the book:I showed the manuscript to him chapter by chapter, briefly summarizing the content of each chapter and emphasizing especially the topics related to his own work. Heisenberg was most interested in the entire manuscript and very open to hearing my ideas. I told him that I saw two basic themes running through all the theories of modern physics, which were also the two basic themes of all mystical traditions-the fundamental interrelatedness and interdependence of all phenomena and the intrinsically dynamic nature of reality. Heisenberg agreed with me as far as physics was concerned and he also told me that he was well aware of the emphasis on interconnectedness in Eastern thought. However, he had been unaware of the dynamic aspect of the Eastern world view and was intrigued when I showed him with numerous examples from my manuscript that the principal Sanskrit terms used in Hindu and Buddhist philosophy-&quot;brahman, rta, lila, karma, samsara,&quot; etc.-had dynamic connotations. At the end of my rather long presentation of the manuscript Heisenberg said simply: &quot;Basically, I am in complete agreement with you.&quot;The book was a best-seller in the United States. It received a positive review from &quot;New York&quot; magazine:
A brilliant best-seller... Lucidly analyzes the tenets of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism to show their striking parallels with the latest discoveries in cyclotrons.

Victor N. Mansfield, a professor of physics and astronomy at Colgate University who wrote many papers and books of his own connecting physics to Buddhism and also to Jungian psychology, complimented &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; in &quot;Physics Today&quot;:
&quot;Fritjof Capra, in &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot;, seeks ... an integration of the mathematical world view of modern physics and the mystical visions of Buddha and Krishna. Where others have failed miserably in trying to unite these seemingly different world views, Capra, a high-energy theorist, has succeeded admirably. I strongly recommend the book to both layman and scientist.&quot;

However, it is not without its critics. Jeremy Bernstein, a professor of physics at the Stevens Institute of Technology, chastised &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot;:

At the heart of the matter is Mr. Capra&#x27;s methodology – his use of what seem to me to be accidental similarities of language as if these were somehow evidence of deeply rooted connections. Thus I agree with Capra when he writes, &quot;Science does not need mysticism and mysticism does not need science but man needs both.&quot; What no one needs, in my opinion, is this superficial and profoundly misleading book.

Leon M. Lederman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and current Director Emeritus of Fermilab, criticized both &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; and Gary Zukav&#x27;s &quot;The Dancing Wu Li Masters&quot; in his 1993 book &quot;The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?&quot;

Starting with reasonable descriptions of quantum physics, he constructs elaborate extensions, totally bereft of the understanding of how carefully experiment and theory are woven together and how much blood, sweat, and tears go into each painful advance.

Philosopher of science Eric Scerri criticizes both Capra and Zukav and similar books.

Peter Woit, a mathematical physicist at Columbia University, criticized Capra for continuing to build his case for physics-mysticism parallels on the bootstrap model of strong-force interactions set out at the end of the book, long after the Standard Model had become thoroughly accepted by physicists as a better model:

&quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; was completed in December 1974, and the implications of the November Revolution one month earlier that led to the dramatic confirmations of the standard-model quantum field theory clearly had not sunk in for Capra (like many others at that time). What is harder to understand is that the book has now gone through several editions, and in each of them Capra has left intact the now out-of-date physics, including new forewords and afterwords that with a straight face deny what has happened. The foreword to the second edition of 1983 claims, &quot;It has been very gratifying for me that none of these recent developments has invalidated anything I wrote seven years ago. In fact, most of them were anticipated in the original edition,&quot; a statement far from any relation to the reality that in 1983 the standard model was nearly universally accepted in the physics community, and the bootstrap theory was a dead idea ... Even now, Capra&#x27;s book, with its nutty denials of what has happened in particle theory, can be found selling well at every major bookstore. It has been joined by some other books on the same topic, most notably Gary Zukav&#x27;s &quot;The Dancing Wu-Li Masters&quot;. The bootstrap philosophy, despite its complete failure as a physical theory, lives on as part of an embarrassing New Age cult, with its followers refusing to acknowledge what has happened.

In a 2019 commemoration in honour of physicist Geoffrey Chew, one of bootstrap&#x27;s &quot;fathers&quot;, Capra replied to criticisms such as Woit&#x27;s:

However, the standard model does not include gravity, and hence fails to integrate all known particles and forces into a single mathematical framework. The currently most popular candidate for such a framework is string theory, which pictures all particles as different vibrations of mathematical &quot;strings&quot; in an abstract 9-dimensional space. The mathematical elegance of string theory is compelling, but the theory has serious deficiencies. If these difficulties persist, and if a theory of &quot;quantum gravity&quot; continues to remain elusive, the bootstrap idea may well be revived someday, in some mathematical formulation or other.

<text>Spiritual Appliances is an album by the American singer-songwriter Sara Hickman, released in 2000.

==Production==
The album was produced by Hickman. It was recorded in Austin, Texas.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; wrote that &quot;there are songs built from the basic beginnings of an acoustic guitar and the singer singing sweetly that end in a near roar, while other tunes lead a chorus of whistlers through a pleasant bit of sentimentality and later, even a lush string section.&quot; &quot;Exclaim!&quot; thought that &quot;all 13 tracks of the bright, airy, jangle pop have a rootsy edge and are full of memorable hooks.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that the &quot;singer-guitarist keeps her wry edge for most of the 13 songs on her self-produced album, rarely lapsing into the too sweet, too poignant, or too gooey.&quot;

<text>A Hawaiian name is a name in the Hawaiian language. Such names are popular not only in Hawaiian families, but also among other residents of Hawaii, and even in the United States mainland among both non-native and native Hawaiians.

==Meanings of names==
Genuine Hawaiian names are unisex. Their literal meaning is usually quite clear, but there may be hidden symbolic meanings known only to the family. Old Hawaiians saw a name as the property of the name-holder, with a power to help or hurt its owner. A meaning that was too apparent might have attracted evil forces. And, just like in Hawaiian poetry, an allusion was considered more beautiful than a plain statement.

Coolness and rain symbolize happiness in a warm climate. Mist is a symbol of romance. Lei means a child, because a beloved child is carried like a lei on the parent&#x27;s shoulders. A child can also be a flower or a bud, regardless of its sex. Modern parents tend to be more prosaic, calling a child a child, as in Keikilani and Kamalani, in which &quot;keiki&quot; and &quot;kama&quot; both mean &quot;child&quot;.

==Traditional naming practices==
Old Hawaiians coined a new name for each child, with careful thought of its meaning. Names might be revealed in dreams or visions. Children could be named after relatives, but names were not copied from other families. Hawaii was a hierarchical society, and the name had to be suitable to one&#x27;s social class and family gods. Names beginning with Kealii-(&quot;the chief&quot;) or ending in -lani (&quot;sky or heaven&quot;) were reserved for chiefs. The lowest social &quot;kauwā&quot; (slave) class were only allowed to take simple names from natural objects.

Any incident at the time of birth might be commemorated in a name. A famous example was the Queen Liliuokalani (&quot;scorching pain of the heaven&quot;), called Liliu (&quot;scorch&quot;) Kamakaeha (&quot;the sore eye&quot;) in childhood. The name was chosen by her great-aunt Kīnau who was suffering from an eye-ache. A person might have several names, formal and informal, and names were changed if they seemed harmful. If a child fell ill, evil sorcery was often suspected. The parents might change the name into something repulsive, like Pupuka (&quot;ugly&quot;) or Kūkae (&quot;excrement&quot;) in order to protect the child. Such names did not cause ostracism among Hawaiians, but foreign visitors were scandalized. An American writes in 1851:

:&quot;You might know that a people must have been vile from the vile names they assume and wear without shame – names that one would be unwilling to translate. All evil appetites and qualities, bodily organs and deformities, mischievous acts and vices, were turned into names.&quot;

In nineteenth century marriage documents, we can find several Hawaiians named, for example, Kamai (&quot;the illness; the genitals&quot;), Kaaihue (&quot;the thief&quot;), Kapela (&quot;the filth&quot;) and Waiwaiole (&quot;worthless&quot;). However, the majority of names have quite pleasant meanings, or are simply descriptive. The most common names, used by both genders, were Kalua (&quot;the second child, companion&quot;), Keawe (&quot;the strand&quot;, symbolic of lineage), Kamaka (&quot;the eye&quot;, symbolic of beloved one), Keaka (&quot;the shadow, essence&quot;), Kealoha (&quot;the love&quot;), Ōpūnui (&quot;big belly&quot;, sign of high social class), and Māhoe (&quot;twin&quot;). The most striking feature of nineteenth century names is their diversity. A unique name was the rule, not the exception. The ten most common names cover only four percent of the population.

==Changes brought by western influence==

Surnames did not exist in ancient Hawaii. Early converts might adopt a Christian name and use their Hawaiian name like a surname. In 1860 Kamehameha IV signed the Act to Regulate Names. Hawaiians were to take their father&#x27;s given name as a surname, and all children born henceforth were to receive a Christian, i.e. English, given name. Hawaiian names were transferred into middle names. The law was not repealed until 1967.

After the annexation of Hawaii to the U.S., knowledge of the Hawaiian language deteriorated. Grandparents could give traditional names to the next two generations, but a baby born into a Hawaiian family in the 2000s might not have any native speaker relatives. Names are borrowed from well-known persons, royalty, mythology, and songs. However, names are sometimes borrowed from direct ancestors and other family members. Mary Kawena Pukui, a traditional Hawaiian, expressed her unease with this practice:

:&quot;My name isn&#x27;t supposed to be given away. My name is for me. But people are always naming babies after me, so I have many namesakes. I don&#x27;t want any of them hurt if there&#x27;s any &quot;kapu&quot; that goes with my name. So I pray, &#x27;Since so-and-so named this child for me, then please do me the favor to &quot;oki&quot; the &quot;kapu&quot; and bless the name.&quot;

Phonetic renderings of western names, such as Kimo (Jim) and Lāhela (Rachel), have become names in their own right. The film industry produces pseudo-Hawaiian names, from &quot;Aloma of the South Seas&quot; (1926) to &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002). For many Hawaiian words, the okina (glottal stop) and kahakō (macron to denote a long vowel) are important to the meaning of a word. They are often ignored in English texts, or okina are added where they do not belong. Hawaiian vowels should be pronounced clearly even when they are not stressed.

==Popularity surveys==
This information is based on a survey of Hawaiian given names of persons born in 1900–1989 and 2000–2005, from obituaries in Honolulu Advertiser and Honolulu Star-Bulletin 1994–2004, and samples of births and marriages on Oahu in Honolulu Star-Bulletin 2000–2005. It&#x27;s a small sample with an uneven age distribution, and centered on Oahu. But no one else seems to have researched the subject at all.

The 3,750 persons in the survey had a total of 1,996 different names. 418 of these names had eight or more syllables (up to 44). The proportion of long names was diminishing but it took an upward turn in 2000–2005. Hawaiian names occur as middle names until the 1960s. Even today, middle names outnumber first names by four to one. A minority of parents have started giving nothing but Hawaiian names to their children. In births registered on Oahu 2001–2002, about 25% of girls and 15% of boys received at least one Hawaiian name.

Names with negative meaning have disappeared in this sample, and the unisex quality is waning. Many favorite names a hundred years ago, like Kealoha, Kalei, Leialoha, and Keonaona, were popular with both sexes. Today, the trendiest names are different for girls and boys. Modern parents seemed to think that the ending -lani belongs to women: 31% of women but only 11% of men had names ending in -lani (&quot;heaven&quot;), -o-ka-lani (&quot;of Heaven&quot;), -o-nā-lani (&quot;of the heavens&quot;) or -mai-ka-lani (&quot;from Heaven&quot;), a recent innovation. Names beginning with the definite article Ka-/Ke- seem to have a masculine image: 46% of men but only 33% of women had such names.

Five percent of the women in this survey were named Leilani (&quot;heavenly lei&quot;). Other popular women&#x27;s names included:
* 1900–1939: Kuulei (&quot;my lei&quot;), Leināala (&quot;the fragrances are wafted&quot;), Leialoha (&quot;lei of love&quot;), Leinani (&quot;beautiful lei&quot;), Leimomi (&quot;pearl necklace&quot;)
* 1940–1969: Puanani (&quot;beautiful flower&quot;), Leialoha, Haunani (&quot;beautiful snow&quot;), Iwalani (&quot;royal Frigatebird&quot;), Uilani (&quot;heavenly young beauty&quot;), Ululani (&quot;heavenly inspiration&quot;)
* 1970–1989: Malia (Mary), Kēhaulani (&quot;heavenly dew&quot;), Kuuipo (&quot;my sweetheart&quot;), Maile (&quot;the maile vine&quot;), Noelani (&quot;heavenly mist&quot;), Puanani
* 2000–2005: Malia, Noelani, Māhealani (&quot;full moon night&quot;), Kuuipo, Alana (&quot;awakening&quot; – although this is also an English name), Keikilani (&quot;heavenly child&quot;)

Kalani (&quot;the sky; the high chief&quot;) was a reasonably popular men&#x27;s name in all age groups. Other popular names for men included:
* 1900–1939: Kealoha (&quot;the love&quot;), Kalei (&quot;the lei&quot;), Kamaka (&quot;the eye/bud/beloved one&quot;)
* 1940–1969: Keala (&quot;the fragrance&quot;, symbolic for high birth), Kāwika (David), Kanani (&quot;the glory&quot;), Kameāloha (&quot;the beloved one&quot;)
* 1970–1989: Ikaika (&quot;strong&quot;), Kāwika, Alika (Alex), Keola (&quot;the life&quot;)
* 2000–2005: Kai (&quot;sea&quot;), Kekoa (&quot;the courage&quot;), Kainoa (&quot;the namesake&quot;), Ikaika, Kaimana (&quot;diamond; powerful sea&quot;), Keoni (John), Makana (&quot;gift&quot;), Nāinoa (&quot;the namesakes&quot;)

The Social Security Administration gives out annual lists of the top hundred names for boys and girls in the State of Hawaii, starting from the year 1960. They are based on first names while a Hawaiian name usually comes second. A few Hawaiian names make it into these lists every year. In 2008, they were Kaila (&quot;style/the birthmark&quot;, although this is also an English variant of Kayla), Maile, Malia, Kalena (&quot;the yellow&quot;), Kiana (Diana), Alana and Kamalei (&quot;lei child&quot;) for girls, and Kai, Kainoa, Keanu (&quot;the coolness&quot;), Kainalu (&quot;billowy sea&quot;), Nāinoa, Kaimana and Kanoa (&quot;the commoner, free man&quot;) for boys.
