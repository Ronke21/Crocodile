<text>David Hepworth (born 27 July 1950) is a British music journalist, writer, television presenter, and publishing industry analyst. He was instrumental in the foundation of a number of popular magazines in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Along with the journalist, editor and broadcaster Mark Ellen, he turned the pop magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot; into one of the most popular UK music magazines of the 1980s. A presenter of &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in the 1980s, he co-presented the BBC broadcast of Live Aid in 1985.

==Early life==
David Hepworth was born in Dewsbury, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and attended the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, and Trent Park College of Education. He studied Drama and Education at Middlesex Polytechnic (now Middlesex University), graduating in 1972. He worked for HMV and Beserkley Records, before becoming a freelance journalist.

==Career==
Hepworth&#x27;s career in journalism began with contributions to &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;. He joined the newly launched magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot; in 1979, and two years later, after turning it around financially, became its editor. In 1983 he launched &quot;Just Seventeen&quot;, a perennially popular magazine for teenage girls, and in 1984 &quot;Looks&quot;. Since then he has launched several other magazines, including &quot;Q&quot; (1986), &quot;More&quot; (1987), &quot;Empire&quot; (1988), &quot;Mojo&quot; (1993), &quot;Heat&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Word&quot; (2003). He is currently director of the publishing company Development Hell.

In the 1980s he presented the BBC television music series &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and was one of the presenters covering the 1985 Live Aid concert from Wembley Stadium. On both of these he worked with long-term friend Mark Ellen. Hepworth has written for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and for the UK trade magazine &quot;InPublishing&quot;.

In the 1990s he was a regular presenter on BBC GLR 94.9 – the BBC&#x27;s Rock station for London.

In 2006, Hepworth sold his independent publishing company Development Hell to the EMAP group (today known as Ascential).

His subsequent primary professional activities are publishing books on music nostalgia and collaborations with Mark Ellen on &quot;Word In Your Ear&quot;, a series of podcasts and music-themed live events.

In 2021, Hepworth&#x27;s book &quot;1971 – Never a Dull Moment: Rock&#x27;s Golden Year&quot; was adapted by Oscar and Bafta-winning director Asif Kapadia into the Apple TV+ documentary mini-series &quot;1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything&quot;.

In December 2023 Hepworth was a member of the team for Middlesex University which participated in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Christmas University Challenge&quot;. The team beat Corpus Christi College, Oxford, by 175 points to 80, in the final.

<doc id="1106518" wikidata="Q1075357" url="?curid=1106518" title="Lu Zhishen">
<text>Lu Zhishen is a fictional character in &quot;Water Margin&quot;, one of the four great classical novels in Chinese literature. He is the main character in the first segment of the novel, which spans about six chapters. Nicknamed &quot;Flowery Monk&quot;, he ranks 13th among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny.

One folk tale derived from the novel says he is a sworn brother of the martial artist Zhou Tong, who purportedly trained the Song dynasty general Yue Fei in archery.

==Background==
The novel depicts Lu Da (), who later becomes a monk with the name Zhishen, as having a round face, big ears, a straight nose, a squarish mouth and a beard which nearly obscures his face. He originally serves as a garrison major in Weizhou (渭州; around present-day Pingliang, Gansu).

One day Lu meets and makes friends with Shi Jin and Li Zhong when he is off duty. As the three are drinking in an inn, they overhear the singer Jin Cuilian crying over her misfortunes. A wealthy butcher, known as Butcher Zheng, has lured Jin, who is stranded in Weizhou with her elderly father, to be his concubine in exchange for money to bury her mother, who has died of illness. But actually no money was handed over. Soon after she moved into Zheng&#x27;s house, the butcher&#x27;s wife, envious of her youth, drove her out. However, Zheng insists that Jin and her father must repay him the money, which has accrued high interests. They are not allowed to leave Weizhou until the &quot;debt&quot; is settled..

After hearing the story, Lu Da gives the father and daughter some money and ensures they leave Weizhou safely. He then goes to Zheng&#x27;s stall intending to teach him a lesson. He provokes Zheng by ordering him to chop up meat to very fine pieces. Zheng loses patience and attacks him with a cleaver. Lu Da easily knocks him down and with three powerful punches on his face inadvertently kills him. Realising that the butcher is dead, Lu Da flees Weizhou.

==Becoming a monk==
While on the run, Lu Da accidentally meets Jin Cuilian&#x27;s father, who has settled down at Yanmen county as his daughter is married to a local squire surnamed Zhao. The squire shelters Lu in his manor but the place is not absolutely safe. Zhao suggests Lu conceal his identity by becoming a Buddhist monk at the Manjusri Monastery on nearby Mount Wutai. The abbot at the monastery accepts Lu and gives him the name &quot;Zhishen&quot;, which means &quot;sagacious&quot;. Lu Da is henceforth known as Lu Zhishen. He also acquires the nickname &quot;Flowery Monk&quot; because his body is tattooed with flowers.

Finding monastic life dreary, one day Lu Zhishen buys and consumes all the wine sold by a wine seller crossing the mountain. When he returns to the monastery drunk, the monks stop him from entering the gate. He breaks in and beats them up. He comes back to his senses when the abbot appears and gives him a dressing down. He is given a second chance.

Soon, feeling bored again, Lu Zhishen sneaks down to the nearby town. There he asks a blacksmith to make him a monk&#x27;s staff weighing 62 &quot;jin&quot; and a dagger. He then visits an inn where he eats and drinks without restraint, disregarding Buddhist prohibitions. When the monks on Mount Wutai see Lu Zhishen coming back intoxicated, they immediately shut the gate on him. But Lu smashes the two towering jingang statues flanking the gate, breaks into the monastery, beats up the monks and messes up the meditation hall. This time, the abbot decides to send him to the Great Minister&#x27;s Temple in the imperial capital Dongjing.

==Encounter with Zhou Tong and Li Zhong==
On his journey to Dongjing, Lu Zhishen passes by Plum Blossom Village and is offered free lodgings for the night at Squire Liu&#x27;s manor. He overhears the family crying and finds out that Zhou Tong, a bandit leader from the nearby Mount Plum Blossom, is coming that very night to forcibly marry Squire Liu&#x27;s daughter. Lu Zhishen lies to the squire that he could dissuade the bandit with his eloquence. Zhou Tong turns up in the finery of a groom and goes to the matrimonial room where he feels his way to the bed in the dark. Lu, who is lying on the bed, jumps onto him and gives him a good thrash. Zhou Tong escapes and asks Li Zhong, the chief of Mount Plum Blossom, to get back at Lu for him. Li Zhong is surprised to find that the monk is Lu Da.

Introduced to the monk by Li Zhong, Zhou Tong is shocked and vows not to disturb the Lius again. Lu Zhishen continues his journey. He meets Shi Jin, who has become a highway robber to obtain money for his journey home. The two team up to defeat and kill a monk and a priest who enslave the monks of a monastery and has been keeping a woman as a sex slave.

==Meeting Lin Chong==
At the Great Minister&#x27;s Temple in Dongjing, Lu Zhishen is assigned to tend to a vegetable plot. There he subdues a group of vegetable stealers. The group is so awed by his physical might and fighting skill that they willingly serve him. They adore him even more when he pulls up a deep-rooted willow tree with sheer brute strength.

One day Lin Chong, instructor of the imperial guard, comes across Lu working out with his hefty staff and is amazed by his martial skill. They become sworn brothers. When Lin Chong is exiled to Cangzhou after being framed by Grand Marshal Gao Qiu, whose god son covets the instructor&#x27;s wife, Lu secretly tails him and his two escorts. He rescues Lin when the two constables, bribed by Gao, are about to murder him in Wild Boar Forest. He is prevented from killing the two men by Lin, who says they are but small fries carrying out an order. Lu accompanies Lin all the way to Cangzhou. Before leaving Lin, he smashes down a tree with a single strike to warn the escorts not to do anything mischievous. He then returns to Dongjing.

==Becoming an outlaw==
Lu Zhishen has to flee Dongjing when he is found to be the monk who ruined Gao Qiu&#x27;s plan to kill Lin Chong. He comes by an inn at Cross Slope, where he is drugged and nearly butchered by the inn owner Sun Erniang, who makes buns with human flesh. He is saved in time by Sun&#x27;s husband Zhang Qing. Zhang suggests he join the outlaw Deng Long on Mount Twin Dragons in Qingzhou. But Deng considers him a threat and barricades the only way up the hill. Lu runs into Yang Zhi, who has also come to join Mount Twin Dragons. Yang takes Lu to Cao Zheng, a butcher who has learnt martial arts from Lin Chong. Cao and Yang pretend that Lu has been drugged and take him up Mount Twin Dragons to be presented to Deng Long. Not suspecting anything, Deng lets them in. Lu hacks Deng to death upon seeing him and is elected the chief of the stronghold.

After his defeat by the bandits of Liangshan Marsh, the imperial general Huyan Zhuo flees to Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong) in the hopes of redeeming himself by wiping out the bandits there. One of the strongholds is Mount Twin Dragons, which, finding Huyan a tough opponent, requests help from Liangshan. Song Jiang, Liangshan&#x27;s then second-in-command, comes to Qingzhou with a force and captures Huyan. The bandits of Mount Twin Dragons, led by Lu Zhishen, are absorbed into Liangshan.

==Life at Liangshan==
Lu Zhishen goes to Huayin County to invite Shi Jin and his gang at Mount Shaohua to join Liangshan. At Mount Shaohua, he is told that Shi is caught by Prefect He of Huazhou when he tries to rescue a woman the official has abducted, desiring to make her his concubine. Lu goes to Huazhou alone to rescue Shi, but he is spotted behaving strangely in a crowd by He when he contemplates assassinating the official upon running into his entourage. Prefect He lures him into his office where he is ambushed and seized too. Mount Shaohua turns to Liangshan for help. The Liangshan outlaws rush to Huazhou, lure Prefect He out of the city and kills him. They enter Huazhou and save Lu Zhishen and Shi Jin.

==Death==

Lu Zhishen is appointed as one of Liangshan&#x27;s infantry leaders after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He is one of the few heroes who objected strongly to Song Jiang&#x27;s quest for amnesty from Emperor Huizong. He nevertheless participates in campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory after Liangshan attains amnesty. He scores top merit when he captures the rebel leader Fang La.

When the run of campaigns ends with Fang La&#x27;s rebellion snuffed out, Lu Zhishen insists on remaining at the Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou instead of returning to Dongjing with the lot. On the night before the rest departs for the capital, Lu is awakened from his sleep by the thunderous sound made by the tidal bore in the nearby Qiantang River as it clashes wave after wave onto the bank. At that instant, he grasps the prophetic message concealed in the verse given him by the abbot of the Mount Wutai monastery. The verse goes:

The first two lines foretell Lu&#x27;s capture of Fang La and Fang‘s right—hand man Xiahou Cheng while the following two refer to the Qiantang River&#x27;s tidal bore, which &quot;faithfully arrives&quot; every year on the 18th day of the 8th Lunar month. The monks of Liuhe Pagoda tell Lu Zhishen that in Buddhist terminology &quot;yuanji&quot; – made up of the characters &quot;yuan&quot; (圓; &quot;complete the circle&quot;) and &quot;ji&quot; (寂; &quot;enter silence&quot;) – means death. Realising that it is time for him to die, Lu Zhishen bathes and lights some fragrant incense. He then composes an ode and asks Song Jiang to come to see him. But he has already passed on sitting cross-legged on a zafu before Song arrives. Song reads the ode:

Confessing in the ode that he has never read the scriptures as a monk and has instead indulged in killing, Lu Zhishen shows he has attained Buddhist enlightenment with the comprehension that everything has a karmic reason. He is given a funeral befitting that of a high priest.

== Cultural references ==
In the 2022 cyber thriller Rise of the Water Margin, which is a 21st century take on the Water Margin, Lu Zhishen is a retired former commander of Unit 61398 who now works as a cyber detective and a mentor to the current commander Lin Chong. His first big case, investigating the skullduggery of Chairman Zheng of a large meat processing corporation, Willow Holdings, is published as an exposé in a business journal as Uprooting the Willow.

<doc id="1106524" wikidata="Q1753530" url="?curid=1106524" title="Cliff 'Em All">
<text>Cliff &#x27;Em All is a compilation of video footage, and the first video album by the American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on November 17, 1987, as a tribute to Metallica&#x27;s bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a tour bus accident on September 27, 1986, at the age of 24, near Ljungby, Sweden, during the European leg of their Master of Puppets world tour. Its title is derived from Metallica&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;. The home video also features a performance with former guitarist Dave Mustaine on March 19, 1983, shortly before his ousting from the band. 

The video is a retrospective on the three and a half years that Cliff Burton was in Metallica, presented as a collection of bootleg footage shot by fans, some professional filming and TV shots that were never used and some of his best bass solos, personal photos and live concerts. Photos and narrations by the band (Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett drinking beer) are placed between songs, which focus on Burton before fading into a title card of a performance. The video ends with the melodic interlude of &quot;Orion&quot; as pictures of Burton are shown.

With this video, the band tries to show the unique personality and style he had. While ostensibly the film focuses on Burton, it also has given fans a rare glimpse of Metallica&#x27;s less-documented early career. This contrasts sharply with the &#x27;Metallica business&#x27; represented in the feature film &quot;&quot;.

The back of the case reads &quot;Well, we finally went and did what we always talked about not doing. Releasing a vid[eo]! Before you throw up in disgust, let us (except K.) tell you the idea behind this.&quot; The &quot;K&quot; is presumably short for Kirk, explaining why he is on the bottom of the cover.

<text>USS &quot;Cincinnati&quot; (SSN-693), a , was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Cincinnati, Ohio. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 4 February 1971 and her keel was laid down on 6 April 1974. She was launched on 19 February 1977 sponsored by Mrs. William J. Keating, and commissioned on 10 June 1978.

In August 1979, &quot;Cincinnati&quot; rescued a Finnish sailor off the east coast of Florida who had been in the water for 22 hours after falling overboard from the Finnish freighter &quot;Finnbeaver&quot;.

In November 1980, after a patrol in the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;Cincinnati&quot; was visited by former President of the United States Richard M. Nixon and Admiral Hyman Rickover.

In 1981, &quot;Cincinnati&quot;, under the command of Commander Kurt T. Juroff USN, conducted an around the world cruise, steaming 60,000 miles and operating in the Indian Ocean. From 8–13 June 1981 &quot;Cincinnati&quot; visited Western Australia, docking at HMAS Stirling, Rockingham for an R&amp;R visit.

&quot;Cincinnati&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 July 1996. Ex-&quot;Cincinnati&quot; was scheduled to enter the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington. After an attempt made to preserve her as a museum and memorial in her namesake city failed, the city now plans on acquiring the sail and other artifacts for display on the riverfront. Update: Pieces of the USS Cincinnati to be installed as a cold war memorial at VOA Park West Chester Ohio. (SUBCINCY.ORG) 

A portion of the submarine, the nuclear reactor compartment, was transported via river barge to Hanford, Washington in September 2014 for disposal.

<doc id="1106528" wikidata="Q2137106" url="?curid=1106528" title="Whitwell, Derbyshire">
<text>Whitwell is a village in Derbyshire, England. The population of the civil parish (including Whitwell Common) taken at the 2021 Census was 3,721.
Although Whitwell celebrated its 1,000th anniversary in the &#x27;Whitwell 1000&#x27; celebrations of 1989, it is much older than this celebration suggests. The earliest written references to Whitwell are from the Anglo-Saxon charters. However, many of its historical sites predate this period. Within the parish are several Iron Age burial mounds, an Iron Age fort and settlement, the remains of a Roman villa, medieval field systems, and both a Norman and Saxon church. The World Heritage Site of Creswell Crags was until recently within the parish. Whitwell Old Hall is a medieval manor house.

The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club.

Whitwell has four public houses. It previously had as many as 11. The current pubs are the Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Social Club), The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer of the village is the quarry and works south of the village managed by Tarmac and Lhoist, which supplies limestone and other products all around the world.

==Whitwell Wood==
Whitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long-term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The valley of Bondhay Dike (containing the spring) is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region; particularly rare orchids. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A Three Shires Oak once stood in a field beside Whitwell Wood, traditionally marking the meeting point of the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire; a younger oak has been planted further from the wood close to the new meeting point of the counties.

== Whitwell Gap (Hwitan Wylles Geat) ==

Anglo Saxon poets recorded King Alfred&#x27;s grandson, King Edmund, conquering the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls in 942 AD, reaching as far as Dore &amp; &quot;Hwitan Wylles Geat&quot; (the Whitwell Gap). Whitwell Gap would have to be a significant landscape feature to warrant mention in an Anglo Saxon chronicle and be easily identifiable but the current location of this feature is unknown. Various theories as to its location are often discussed locally including Creswell Crags, the valley of Bondhay Dike (being an ancient border) and Markland Grips.

==Famous Whitwellians==
One of Whitwell&#x27;s most famous sons was Joe Davis, world snooker and billiards champion from the 1920s to the 1940s. His Whitwell home (on Welbeck Street) bears a plaque commemorating him.

Les Jackson, England cricketer and Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1959, played for Whitwell Cricket Club and came to watch their games on a Saturday afternoon until his death in 2007.

Also from the village are Chris Adams, the Sussex and England cricketer and Ian Bennett, a former professional goalkeeper for Birmingham City and Huddersfield Town, whose family still lives in the village.

Great War poet John William Streets was from Whitwell, recorded as living in Oak Terrace, now Portland Street. Streets was recorded wounded and missing on the first day of the Battle of the Somme and later recorded killed in action. His poetry collection &quot;The Undying Splendour&quot; was published posthumously in 1916.

The village is the birthplace and childhood home of J. T. Edson the author, whose various escapism-adventure series sold over 27 million copies globally; the Edson family lived in Whitwell from Victorian times.

<doc id="1106531" wikidata="Q354025" url="?curid=1106531" title="Intrusive rock">
<text>Intrusive rock is formed when magma penetrates existing rock, crystallizes, and solidifies underground to form &quot;intrusions&quot;, such as batholiths, dikes, sills, laccoliths, and volcanic necks.

Intrusion is one of the two ways igneous rock can form. The other is extrusion, such as a volcanic eruption or similar event. An intrusion is any body of intrusive igneous rock, formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of the planet. In contrast, an &quot;extrusion&quot; consists of extrusive rock, formed above the surface of the crust.

Some geologists use the term plutonic rock synonymously with intrusive rock, but other geologists subdivide intrusive rock, by crystal size, into coarse-grained plutonic rock (typically formed deeper in the Earth&#x27;s crust in batholiths or stocks) and medium-grained subvolcanic or hypabyssal rock (typically formed higher in the crust in dikes and sills).

==Classification==
Because the solid country rock into which magma intrudes is an excellent insulator, cooling of the magma is extremely slow, and intrusive igneous rock is coarse-grained (phaneritic). However, the rate of cooling is greatest for intrusions at relatively shallow depth, and the rock in such intrusions is often much less coarse-grained than intrusive rock formed at greater depth. Coarse-grained intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the Earth are called &quot;abyssal&quot; or &quot;plutonic&quot; while those that form near the surface are called subvolcanic or &quot;hypabyssal&quot;.

Plutonic rocks are classified separately from extrusive igneous rocks, generally on the basis of their mineral content. The relative amounts of quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and feldspathoid are particularly important in classifying intrusive igneous rocks, and most plutonic rocks are classified by where they fall in the QAPF diagram. Dioritic and gabbroic rocks are further distinguished by whether the plagioclase they contain is sodium-rich, and sodium-poor gabbros are classified by their relative contents of various iron- or magnesium-rich minerals (mafic minerals) such as olivine, hornblende, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene, which are the most common mafic minerals in intrusive rock. Rare ultramafic rocks, which contain more than 90% mafic minerals, and carbonatite rocks, containing over 50% carbonate minerals, have their own special classifications.

Hypabyssal rocks resemble volcanic rocks more than they resemble plutonic rocks, being nearly as fine-grained, and are usually assigned volcanic rock names. However, dikes of basaltic composition often show grain sizes intermediate between plutonic and volcanic rock, and are classified as diabases or dolerites. Rare ultramafic hypabyssal rocks called &quot;lamprophyres&quot; have their own classification scheme.

== Characteristics ==
Intrusive rocks are characterized by large crystal sizes, and as the individual crystals are visible, the rock is called &quot;phaneritic&quot;. There are few indications of flow in intrusive rocks, since their texture and structure mostly develops in the final stages of crystallization, when flow has ended. Contained gases cannot escape through the overlying strata, and these gases sometimes form cavities, often lined with large, well-shaped crystals. These are particularly common in granites and their presence is described as &quot;miarolitic texture&quot;. Because their crystals are of roughly equal size, intrusive rocks are said to be &quot;equigranular&quot;.

Plutonic rocks are less likely than volcanic rocks to show a pronounced porphyritic texture, in which a first generation of large well-shaped crystals are embedded in a fine-grained ground-mass. The minerals of each have formed in a definite order, and each has had a period of crystallization that may be very distinct or may have coincided with or overlapped the period of formation of some of the other ingredients. Earlier crystals originated at a time when most of the rock was still liquid and are more or less perfect. Later crystals are less regular in shape because they were compelled to occupy the spaces left between the already-formed crystals. The former case is said to be idiomorphic (or &quot;automorphic&quot;); the latter is xenomorphic.

There are also many other characteristics that serve to distinguish plutonic from volcanic rock. For example, the alkali feldspar in plutonic rocks is typically orthoclase, while the higher-temperature polymorph, sanidine, is more common in volcanic rock. The same distinction holds for nepheline varieties. Leucite is common in lavas but very rare in plutonic rocks. Muscovite is confined to intrusions. These differences show the influence of the physical conditions under which crystallization takes place.

Hypabyssal rocks show structures intermediate between those of extrusive and plutonic rocks. They are very commonly porphyritic, vitreous, and sometimes even vesicular. In fact, many of them are petrologically indistinguishable from lavas of similar composition.

==Occurrences==

Plutonic rocks form 7% of the Earth&#x27;s current land surface. Intrusions vary widely, from mountain-range-sized batholiths to thin veinlike fracture fillings of aplite or pegmatite.

*Batholith: a large irregular discordant intrusion
*Chonolith: an irregularly-shaped intrusion with a demonstrable base
*Cupola: a dome-shaped projection from the top of a large subterranean intrusion
*Dike: a relatively narrow tabular discordant body, often nearly vertical
*Laccolith: concordant body with roughly flat base and top, usually with a feeder pipe below
*Lopolith: concordant body with roughly flat top and a shallow convex base, may have a feeder dike or pipe below
*Phacolith: a concordant lens-shaped pluton that typically occupies the crest of an anticline or trough of a syncline
*Volcanic pipe or volcanic neck: tubular, roughly vertical body that may have been a feeder vent for a volcano
*Sill: a relatively thin tabular concordant body intruded along bedding planes
*Stock: a smaller irregular discordant intrusive
**Boss: a small stock

<text>The tompot blenny (Parablennius gattorugine) is a species of combtooth blenny from the north eastern Atlantic Ocean which is found in shallow, coastal waters off western Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa.

==Description==
The tompot blenny is a relatively large blenny with an elongated body, large head and large eyes which grows to up to in length. The eyes are bicoloured with their top part being brown and the bottom part is white. There is a single branched tentacle over each of its eyes. It is mainly yellow-brown in colour, although occasionally it is greenish and is marked with at least seven dark bars starting at the dorsal fin and which reach the belly. As well as the tentacles over the eyes there are also tentacles over the nostrils. The lateral line is continuous but becomes broken towards the tail. The breeding males become chocolate brown in colour and develop bulb-like glands on the spines of the anal fin. The dorsal fin runs the length of its body and is divided into two halves by a shallow notch. The anterior portion of the fin is contains the spiny rays while the posterior portion contains the soft rays. The dorsal fin has 13–14 spines and 17–20 ray while the anal fin has 2 spines and 19–23 rays. It has relatively large pectoral fins. Each individual has a unique set of markings on the scales of the face which mean that studies of their biology can identify individuals.

==Distribution==
The tompot blenny is found along the Atlantic coast of Europe from southern England and Ireland to Morocco. It is also found throughout the Mediterranean Sea to the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. In Great Britain it is mainly recorded off the south and west coasts and is largely absent from the North Sea coasts, although it has been seen on wrecks off the North Norfolk coast. and off eastern Scotland as far north as the Shetland Islands.

==Habitat and biology==
===Habitat===
Tompot blennies are very territorial and their territories are centred around a crevice in the rocky reef which the fish uses for shelter. They occur in shallow seas at depths of although smaller specimens occur in rockpools. They may be found above the low tide mark at very low tides, sheltering under boulders or among exposed vegetation.

===Feeding===
Tompot blennies have sharp, comb-like teeth which they use to scrape food from the substrate. They feed on sea anemones and on other invertebrates such as prawns and other crustaceans. They are crepuscular, being active mainly at dawn and at dusk.

===Parasites===
As most fish, tompot blennies harbour several species of parasites, including the capillariid Nematode &quot;Pseudocapillaria bainae&quot;. This parasite has been found in the intestine of specimens caught off Italy and Montenegro. Its biology is unknown.

===Breeding===
Tompot blennies spawn in March to May the males mate with a number of females and guards their eggs. The eggs are demersal and like those of all blennies they stick to the substrate by a filamentous adhesive patch. The male guards the eggs until the larvae hatch, usually about a month after laying. The males defend their territories from other males and often fight each other, frequently receiving injuries. When breeding the males develop pale cauliflower like glands on their anal fins which are believed to play a role in attracting females and in cleaning the eggs.

==Name==
The specific name was first used by Francis Willughby in 1688 after he had observed these blennies in Venice and heard them called &quot;gatto ruggine&quot; which he translated as &quot;rusty cat&quot; or &quot;rust colour&quot;, although he was afraid that he did not fully understand the name. However the actual name is &quot;&quot; or &quot;gotto rosula&quot; which is a local name for blennies in general along the Adriatic coast of Italy and which is a diminutive of &quot;gotto roso&quot; meaning &quot;thick throat&quot;.

<text>William Cooper (December 2, 1754 – December 22, 1809) was an American merchant, land speculator and developer, the founder of Cooperstown, New York. A politician, he was appointed as a county judge and later served two terms in the United States Congress, representing Otsego County and central New York. He was the father of James Fenimore Cooper, who became a noted writer of historical novels related to the New York frontier.

==Life==
Cooper was born in 1754 in a log house in Smithfield (now Somerton) in the Province of Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, the son of English Quaker parents, James Cooper (b. Byberry, Philadelphia, 1729–1795) and Hannah (Hibbs) Cooper. He appears to have first worked as a wheelwright in and around Byberry. He later settled in Burlington, New Jersey, a Quaker city.

==Marriage and family==
On December 12, 1774, in Burlington, he was married by a civil magistrate to Elizabeth Fenimore, daughter of Richard Fenimore, a Quaker of Rancocas.

Cooper had five sons and two daughters. His eldest daughter, Hannah, died in 1800 after a fall from a horse. His son James Fenimore Cooper became a successful novelist. All of his other children, aside from James and his youngest daughter Ann, died in their thirties.

==Career==
During the early 1780s, Cooper became a storekeeper in Burlington, New Jersey, located along the Delaware River. By the end of the decade, he was a successful land speculator and wealthy frontier developer in what is now Otsego County, New York. Soon after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, he acquired a tract of land several thousand acres in extent within the borders of New York state and lying along the head waters of the Susquehanna River at Otsego Lake. He founded the Village of Otsego at the foot of the lake in 1786, creating a traditional plan for the village inspired by that of Burlington. He moved his family there, arriving on November 10, 1790. The judge and other investors also founded De Kalb, New York, near the east end of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, in 1803, platting approximately 64,000 acres and selling the parcels on. His brother James took care of the holdings, which were tied up in litigation for years, both before and after the death of Judge Cooper in 1809. The Cooper family holdings were all gone by 1817. In 1852, a village was named Cooper&#x27;s Falls north of De Kalb. James stayed in the area, and his son William grew up in De Kalb and was a carpenter. The existing De Kalb Historical Society building was built by the judge&#x27;s nephew, William, and some of his descendants may still live in the area.

After 1791, when Otsego County was split off from Montgomery County, Cooper was appointed as a county judge. He was later elected to two terms in Congress, representing the Federalist Party in the 4th (March 4, 1795 – March 3, 1797) and the 6th United States Congresses (March 4, 1799 – March 3, 1801), after being defeated in the 5th Congress by James Cochran. He was also a candidate for the same seat in 1793.

In 1796, Cooper determined to make his home permanently in the town he had founded, which by that time promised to become a thriving settlement. It attracted many land-hungry migrants from New England. He began the construction of a mansion, completed in 1799, which he named Otsego Hall. For many years it served as his manor house; it was by far the most spacious and stately private residence in central New York.

In the first decade of the 1800s, Cooperstown began to struggle financially and saw a significant increase in violent crime, with Cooper himself being caned in the streets in 1807.

Cooper family tradition has it that Judge Cooper was killed by a blow to the head sustained during an argument with a political opponent after a public meeting in Albany, New York on December 22, 1809. No evidence of this can be found, and the story appeared to arise in 1897. A great-grandson of the judge published this account, which historians consider implausible. They believe that Judge Cooper died of natural causes.

Cooper was buried at the Episcopal Christ Churchyard in Cooperstown. His son James Fenimore Cooper, a popular author of historical novels, was buried there many years later.

A great-grandson, Paul F. Clark, became a Nebraska State Representative. A great-great-grandson, writer Paul Fenimore Cooper, is known for the children&#x27;s adventure, &quot;&quot; (1929, reprint 1957 and 2001).

<text>Geddington is a village and civil parish on the A4300, previously A43, in North Northamptonshire between Kettering and Corby. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,503, virtually unchanged from 1,504 at the 2001 census.

The villages name means &quot;Farm/settlement connected Gaete&quot; or &quot;farm/settlement connected with Geiti&quot;. Alternatively, &quot;goat place farm/settlement&quot;.

The village contains an Eleanor cross. The monument dates from 1294, when the crosses were raised as a memorial by Edward I (1239–1307) to his late wife, Eleanor of Castile (1241–1290). There were originally 12 monuments, one in each resting place of the funeral procession as they travelled to Westminster Abbey. The Geddington cross is one of only three Eleanor crosses still standing; the other two being in Hardingstone (near Northampton) and Waltham Cross, although remnants and reconstructions of the lost ones can also be seen at other sites. The Geddington cross is regarded as the best preserved.

The village was also formerly home to a Royal hunting lodge which was used as a base by monarchs for hunting within the Royal forest of Rockingham. The building has subsequently been lost; however, the &quot;King&#x27;s Door&quot; within the church of St Mary Magdalene, Geddington in the village remains, it was the entrance through which the King could enter the building while staying at the lodge.

The old main road runs through the village and crosses the River Ise by a spectacular mediaeval bridge. The bridge, built in 1250, has five arches and three pedestrian refuges. A more recent ford also runs alongside the bridge. The village is famous for its annual boxing day squirt in which a barrel attached to a rope across the river is squirted from one side of the ford to the other by competing fire crews from Geddington and Kettering.

Geddington has two public houses: The Star Inn and The White Hart. The village has one cafe/restaurant &#x27;Café Oak&#x27;.

==Transport==
The nearest mainline railway station is Kettering railway station, a distance of from the village. Corby railway station is from the village.

There is a partial cycle path from the village to the nearby town of Kettering and the village of Weekley, but difficulty crossing the road at Weekley means cycling remains an underused mode of transportation.

<text>John Frederick Kensett (March 22, 1816 – December 14, 1872) was an American
landscape painter and engraver born in Cheshire, Connecticut. He was a member of the second generation of the Hudson River School of artists. Kensett&#x27;s signature works are landscape paintings of New England and New York State, whose clear light and serene surfaces celebrate transcendental qualities of nature, and are associated with Luminism. Kensett&#x27;s early work owed much to the influence of Thomas Cole, but was from the outset distinguished by a preference for cooler colors and an interest in less dramatic topography, favoring restraint in both palette and composition. The work of Kensett&#x27;s maturity features tranquil scenery depicted with a spare geometry, culminating in series of paintings in which coastal promontories are balanced against glass-smooth water. He was a founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

==Biography==
Born on March 22, 1816, Kensett attended school at Cheshire Academy and studied engraving with his English immigrant father, Thomas Kensett, and later with his uncle, Alfred Daggett. He worked as an engraver in the New Haven area until about 1838, then went to work as a banknote engraver in New York City.

In 1840, along with Asher Durand and John William Casilear, Kensett traveled to Europe to study painting. There he met and traveled with Benjamin Champney. The two sketched and painted throughout Europe, refining their talents. During this period, Kensett developed an appreciation and affinity for 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. Kensett and Champney returned to the United States in 1847.

===Established studio===

After establishing his studio and settling in New York, Kensett traveled extensively throughout the Northeast and the Colorado Rockies as well as making several trips back to Europe.

Kensett is best known for his landscape of upstate New York and New England and seascapes of coastal New Jersey, Long Island, and New England. He is most closely associated with the &quot;second generation&quot; of the Hudson River School. Along with Sanford Robinson Gifford, Fitz Henry Lane, Jasper Francis Cropsey, Martin Johnson Heade and others, the works of the &quot;Luminists&quot;, as they came to be known, were characterized by unselfconscious, nearly invisible brushstrokes used to convey the qualities and effects of atmospheric light. Such effects stemmed from Transcendentalist philosophies of sublime nature and contemplation bringing one closer to spiritual truth. In 1848 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1849.

In 1851 Kensett painted a monumental canvas of Mount Washington that has become an icon of White Mountain art. &quot;Mount Washington from the Valley of Conway&quot; was purchased by the American Art Union, made into an engraving by James Smillie, and distributed to 13,000 Art Union subscribers throughout the country. Other artists painted copies of this scene from the print. Currier and Ives published a similar print in about 1860. This single painting by Kensett helped to popularize the White Mountain region of New Hampshire.
Kensett&#x27;s style evolved gradually, from the traditional Hudson River School manner in the 1850s into the more refined Luminist style in his later years. By the early 1870s, Kensett was spending considerable time at his home on Contentment Island, on Long Island Sound near Darien, Connecticut.

It was during this time that Kensett painted some of his finest works. Many of these were spare and luminist seascapes, the prime example being &quot;Eaton&#x27;s Neck, Long Island&quot; (1872) now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

The artist was widely acclaimed and financially successful during his lifetime. In turn, he was generous in support of the arts and artists. He was a full member of the National Academy of Design, the founder and president of the Artists&#x27; Fund Society, and a founder and trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

==Death==
Kensett contracted pneumonia (perhaps during the attempted rescue of Mary Lydia (Hancock) Colyer, the wife of his friend and fellow artist Vincent Colyer in Long Island Sound) and died of heart failure at his New York studio in December 1872. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. In 1874 Kensett&#x27;s brother Thomas gave thirty-eight of his paintings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of which half remain in the collection.

==Legacy==
The first complete biography and factual study of Kensett&#x27;s work were written by Ellen H. Johnson, published in 1957.

<doc id="1106551" wikidata="Q4824103" url="?curid=1106551" title="Australian Education Union">
<text>The Australian Education Union (AEU) is an Australian trade union, founded in 1984 as the Australian Teachers Union, which is registered with Fair Work Australia as an employee group, and is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The AEU is Australia&#x27;s third largest trade union, with 198,480 registered members in 2021, consisting of educators who work in public schools, colleges, early childhood and vocational settings in all states and territories of Australia. Members include teachers and allied educational staff, principals and administrators mainly in government school and TAFE systems. Teachers working in the private schools system are covered by the Independent Education Union of Australia (IEU). In some states the AEU shares coverage of some members with the National Tertiary Education Union, Community and Public Sector Union and United Workers Union. Through the Federation of Education Unions, the AEU works closely with the two other Federal unions which cover educators in non-government schools and universities. The AEU is also internationally affiliated to the Education International, which the AEU claims is &quot;the largest non-government organisation in the world.&quot;

==National organisation==

The Federal Office sees its core business as, &quot;the maintenance of comprehensive industrial protection and representation through industrial awards and agreements in all industrial tribunals in Australia. This involves industrial research, negotiation and advocacy over a wide range of matters including salaries and teaching and learning conditions.&quot;

==History==
In the 19th century the Colonial governments, which would later form the Commonwealth of Australia as states, established a variety of state schools. These schools were both demanded by the Australian trade union and labour movement, for the free education of the working class, and also used as a way to control the education and free time of the children of the Australian working class. Schools systems were highly stratified, with most children only receiving infants or primary education. Selection for Technical or Academic high school was highly competitive, and biased towards the children of agriculturalists, industrialists, business owners and professionals. Teachers were low-paid government employees and controlled by a series of moral codes that restricted their professional, personal and sexual conduct. Teachers were primarily educated in Technical colleges, fully funded by the governments, and indentured to Government employment in rural or remote districts for a long period. Buildings and teaching materials were notoriously bad, and often resulted in injuries to teachers or children. University educated teachers were a rarity, and tended to go into the private schools system.

The private school system itself was split between two main groups: a British-style system of schools for the elite, and a massively underfunded Catholic church-run system. The Catholic education system usually shared the poor working and teaching conditions of the state schools.

During the 1950s teachers in the state school system became more unionised and better organised. These women and men had received free University education on the condition that they teach in the state school system, or had received University training as a result of their status as Second World War veterans and had chosen to teach. These teachers, and those following them, campaigned to increase teacher&#x27;s salaries, to transform the structure of Australian education, and to improve the curriculum.

This militancy achieved its peak in the 1970s when teachers won salaries equivalent to state parliament backbenchers, a massive and systemic initiative for building improvements, and massive curriculum reform.

The Australian Teachers Union was established in 1984, and following a series of union mergers with the ACT Teachers&#x27; Federation, the Northern Territory Teachers&#x27; Federation, the South Australian Institute of Teachers and the Australian Teachers&#x27; Federation, changed its name to the Australian Education Union in 1993.

==Indigenous education==
The AEU has a designated Indigenous position on its Federal Executive, an Indigenous observer position on the AEU TAFE Executive, and runs an annual seminar on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education.

In 2010, the AEU made a submission (authorised by Angelo Gavrielatos, AEU Federal President) to the Australian Government&#x27;s draft Indigenous Education Action Plan 2010–2014. The submission included 40 recommendations on improving Indigenous education, and stated: &quot;The realistic timeframe that should be considered to achieve outcomes for Indigenous people equal to the rest of the community is to focus on the outcomes that should be expected for the children to be born in 20 to 25 years from today&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the Smith normal form (sometimes abbreviated SNF) is a normal form that can be defined for any matrix (not necessarily square) with entries in a principal ideal domain (PID). The Smith normal form of a matrix is diagonal, and can be obtained from the original matrix by multiplying on the left and right by invertible square matrices. In particular, the integers are a PID, so one can always calculate the Smith normal form of an integer matrix. The Smith normal form is very useful for working with finitely generated modules over a PID, and in particular for deducing the structure of a quotient of a free module. It is named after the Irish mathematician Henry John Stephen Smith.

==Definition==

Let formula_1 be a nonzero formula_2 matrix over a principal ideal domain formula_3. There exist invertible formula_4 and formula_5-matrices formula_6 (with entries in formula_3) such that the product formula_8 is

formula_9

and the diagonal elements formula_10 satisfy formula_11 for all formula_12. This is the Smith normal form of the matrix formula_1. The elements formula_10 are unique up to multiplication by a unit and are called the &quot;elementary divisors&quot;, &quot;invariants&quot;, or &quot;invariant factors&quot;. They can be computed (up to multiplication by a unit) as
: formula_15
where formula_16 (called &quot;i&quot;-th &quot;determinant divisor&quot;) equals the greatest common divisor of the determinants of all formula_17 minors of the matrix formula_1 and formula_19.

Example : For a formula_20 matrix, formula_21 with formula_22 and formula_23.

== Algorithm ==
The first goal is to find invertible square matrices formula_24 and formula_25 such that the product formula_26 is diagonal. This is the hardest part of the algorithm. Once diagonality is achieved, it becomes relatively easy to put the matrix into Smith normal form. Phrased more abstractly, the goal is to show that, thinking of formula_1 as a map from formula_28 (the free formula_3-module of rank formula_30) to formula_31 (the free formula_3-module of rank formula_33), there are isomorphisms formula_34 and formula_35 such that formula_36 has the simple form of a diagonal matrix. The matrices formula_24 and formula_25 can be found by starting out with identity matrices of the appropriate size, and modifying formula_24 each time a row operation is performed on formula_1 in the algorithm by the corresponding column operation (for example, if row formula_41 is added to row formula_42 of formula_1, then column formula_42 should be subtracted from column formula_41 of formula_24 to retain the product invariant), and similarly modifying formula_25 for each column operation performed. Since row operations are left-multiplications and column operations are right-multiplications, this preserves the invariant formula_48 where formula_49 denote current values and formula_1 denotes the original matrix; eventually the matrices in this invariant become diagonal. Only invertible row and column operations are performed, which ensures that formula_24 and formula_25 remain invertible matrices.

For formula_53, write formula_54 for the number of prime factors of formula_55 (these exist and are unique since any PID is also a unique factorization domain). In particular, formula_3 is also a Bézout domain, so it is a gcd domain and the gcd of any two elements satisfies a Bézout&#x27;s identity.

To put a matrix into Smith normal form, one can repeatedly apply the following, where formula_57 loops from 1 to formula_33.

===Step I: Choosing a pivot===
Choose formula_59 to be the smallest column index of formula_1 with a non-zero entry, starting the search at column index formula_61 if formula_62.

We wish to have formula_63; if this is the case this step is complete, otherwise there is by assumption some formula_64 with formula_65, and we can exchange rows formula_57 and formula_64, thereby obtaining formula_63.

Our chosen pivot is now at position formula_69.

===Step II: Improving the pivot===
If there is an entry at position (&quot;k&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;) such that formula_70, then, letting formula_71, we know by the Bézout property that there exist σ, τ in &quot;R&quot; such that

:formula_72

By left-multiplication with an appropriate invertible matrix &quot;L&quot;, it can be achieved that row &quot;t&quot; of the matrix product is the sum of σ times the original row &quot;t&quot; and τ times the original row &quot;k&quot;, that row &quot;k&quot; of the product is another linear combination of those original rows, and that all other rows are unchanged. Explicitly, if σ and τ satisfy the above equation, then for formula_73 and formula_74 (which divisions are possible by the definition of β) one has

:formula_75

so that the matrix

:formula_76

is invertible, with inverse

:formula_77

Now &quot;L&quot; can be obtained by fitting formula_78 into rows and columns &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; of the identity matrix. By construction the matrix obtained after left-multiplying by &quot;L&quot; has entry β at position (&quot;t&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;) (and due to our choice of α and γ it also has an entry 0 at position (&quot;k&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;), which is useful though not essential for the algorithm). This new entry β divides the entry formula_79 that was there before, and so in particular formula_80; therefore repeating these steps must eventually terminate. One ends up with a matrix having an entry at position (&quot;t&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;) that divides all entries in column &quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;.

===Step III: Eliminating entries===
Finally, adding appropriate multiples of row &quot;t&quot;, it can be achieved that all entries in column &quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot; except for that at position (&quot;t&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;) are zero. This can be achieved by left-multiplication with an appropriate matrix. However, to make the matrix fully diagonal we need to eliminate nonzero entries on the row of position (&quot;t&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;) as well. This can be achieved by repeating the steps in Step II for columns instead of rows, and using multiplication on the right by the transpose of the obtained matrix &quot;L&quot;. In general this will result in the zero entries from the prior application of Step III becoming nonzero again.

However, notice that each application of Step II for either rows or columns must continue to reduce the value of formula_81, and so the process must eventually stop after some number of iterations, leading to a matrix where the entry at position (&quot;t&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;) is the only non-zero entry in both its row and column.

At this point, only the block of &quot;A&quot; to the lower right of (&quot;t&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;t&quot;) needs to be diagonalized, and conceptually the algorithm can be applied recursively, treating this block as a separate matrix. In other words, we can increment &quot;t&quot; by one and go back to Step I.

===Final step===
Applying the steps described above to the remaining non-zero columns of the resulting matrix (if any), we get an formula_2-matrix with column indices formula_83 where formula_84. The matrix entries formula_85 are non-zero, and every other entry is zero.

Now we can move the null columns of this matrix to the right, so that the nonzero entries are on positions formula_86 for formula_87. For short, set formula_10 for the element at position formula_86.

The condition of divisibility of diagonal entries might not be satisfied. For any index formula_90 for which formula_91, one can repair this shortcoming by operations on rows and columns formula_41 and formula_93 only: first add column formula_93 to column formula_41 to get an entry formula_96 in column &quot;i&quot; without disturbing the entry formula_10 at position formula_86, and then apply a row operation to make the entry at position formula_86 equal to formula_100 as in Step II; finally proceed as in Step III to make the matrix diagonal again. Since the new entry at position formula_101 is a linear combination of the original formula_102, it is divisible by β.

The value formula_103 does not change by the above operation (it is δ of the determinant of the upper formula_104 submatrix), whence that operation does diminish (by moving prime factors to the right) the value of
:formula_105
So after finitely many applications of this operation no further application is possible, which means that we have obtained formula_106 as desired.

Since all row and column manipulations involved in the process are invertible, this shows that there exist invertible formula_4 and formula_5-matrices &quot;S, T&quot; so that the product &quot;S A T&quot; satisfies the definition of a Smith normal form. In particular, this shows that the Smith normal form exists, which was assumed without proof in the definition.

== Applications ==

The Smith normal form is useful for computing the homology of a chain complex when the chain modules of the chain complex are finitely generated. For instance, in topology, it can be used to compute the homology of a finite simplicial complex or CW complex over the integers, because the boundary maps in such a complex are just integer matrices. It can also be used to determine the invariant factors that occur in the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, which includes the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.

The Smith normal form is also used in control theory to compute transmission and blocking zeros of a transfer function matrix.

== Example ==
As an example, we will find the Smith normal form of the following matrix over the integers.

:formula_109

The following matrices are the intermediate steps as the algorithm is applied to the above matrix.

:formula_110

:formula_111

:formula_112

So the Smith normal form is

:formula_113

and the invariant factors are 2, 2 and 156.

== Run-time complexity ==
The Smith Normal Form of an &quot;N&quot;-by-&quot;N&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; can be computed in time formula_114. If the matrix is sparse, the computation is typically much faster.

== Similarity ==
The Smith normal form can be used to determine whether or not matrices with entries over a common field formula_115 are similar. Specifically two matrices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are similar if and only if the characteristic matrices formula_116 and formula_117 have the same Smith normal form (working in the PID formula_118).

For example, with
:formula_119

&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are similar because the Smith normal form of their characteristic matrices match, but are not similar to &quot;C&quot; because the Smith normal form of the characteristic matrices do not match.

<doc id="1106568" wikidata="Q945681" url="?curid=1106568" title="Rudy Van Gelder">
<text>Rudolph Van Gelder (November 2, 1924 – August 25, 2016) was an American recording engineer who specialized in jazz. Over more than half a century, he recorded several thousand sessions, with musicians including Booker Ervin, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Lee Morgan, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, Horace Silver, Herbie Hancock, Grant Green and George Benson. He worked with many different record companies, and recorded almost every session on Blue Note Records from 1953 to 1967.

He worked on albums including John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot;, Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;, Sonny Rollins&#x27;s &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot;, and Horace Silver&#x27;s &quot;Song for My Father&quot;. He is regarded as one of the most influential engineers in jazz.

==Early life==
Van Gelder was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. His parents, Louis Van Gelder and the former Sarah Cohen ran a women&#x27;s clothing store in Passaic. His interest in microphones and electronics can be traced to a youthful enthusiasm for amateur radio. He was also a longtime jazz fan. His uncle, for whom Rudy was named, had been the drummer for Ted Lewis&#x27;s band in the mid-1930s. During his high school years, Van Gelder took trumpet lessons and played in the school band.

Van Gelder trained as an optometrist at Philadelphia&#x27;s Pennsylvania College of Optometry because he did not think he could earn a living as a recording engineer. He received an O.D. degree from the institution in 1946. Thereafter, Van Gelder maintained an optometry practice in Teaneck, New Jersey until 1959 when he made the transition to full-time recording engineer.

==Career==
In the evenings after work, Van Gelder recorded local musicians who wanted 78-rpm recordings of their work. From 1946, Van Gelder recorded in his parents&#x27; house in Hackensack, New Jersey, in which a control room was built adjacent to the living room, which served as the musicians&#x27; performing area. The dry acoustics of this working space were partly responsible for Van Gelder&#x27;s inimitable recording aesthetic.

&quot;When I first started, I was interested in improving the quality of the playback equipment I had,&quot; Van Gelder commented in 2005; &quot;I never was really happy with what I heard. I always assumed the records made by the big companies sounded better than what I could reproduce. So that&#x27;s how I got interested in the process. I acquired everything I could to play back audio: speakers, turntables, amplifiers&quot;. One of Van Gelder&#x27;s friends, the baritone saxophonist Gil Mellé, introduced him to Alfred Lion, a producer for Blue Note Records, in 1953.

In the 1950s, Van Gelder performed engineering and mastering for the classical label Vox Records. He became a full-time recording engineer in 1959. In 1959, he moved the Van Gelder Studio to a larger purpose-built facility in Englewood Cliffs, a few miles southeast of the original location. An obituarist in the London &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote of &quot;Van Gelder&#x27;s extreme fastidiousness&quot; as an engineer, and his insistence on &quot;no food or drink in the studio, and on no account was anyone to touch a microphone. He himself always wore gloves when handling equipment&quot;.

===Later career===
Though his output slowed, Van Gelder remained active as a recording engineer into the new century. In the late 1990s, he worked as a recording engineer for some of the songs featured in the soundtracks for the Japanese anime series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. From 1999, he remastered the analog Blue Note recordings he had made several decades earlier into 24-bit digital recordings in its RVG Edition series. He was positive about the switch from analog to digital technology. He told &quot;Audio&quot; magazine in 1995:
The biggest distorter is the LP itself. I&#x27;ve made thousands of LP masters. I used to make 17 a day, with two lathes going simultaneously, and I&#x27;m glad to see the LP go. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, good riddance. It was a constant battle to try to make that music sound the way it should. It was never any good. And if people don&#x27;t like what they hear in digital, they should blame the engineer who did it. Blame the mastering house. Blame the mixing engineer. That&#x27;s why some digital recordings sound terrible, and I&#x27;m not denying that they do, but don&#x27;t blame the medium.

Van Gelder continued to reside in Englewood Cliffs until his death on August 25, 2016.

==The Van Gelder sound==

Van Gelder was secretive about his recording methods, leaving fans and critics to speculate about his techniques. He would go as far as to move microphones when bands were being photographed in the studio. His recording techniques are often admired by his fans for their transparency, clarity, realism, warmth and presence. Van Gelder pioneered use of close miking techniques, peak limiting, and tape saturation to imbue the music with an added sense of immediacy. He also demonstrated a commitment to superior signal-to-noise ratio while recording and mastering, allowing Van Gelder to achieve greater volume on his LPs and minimize tape hiss and vinyl surface noise. Van Gelder was unusual compared to other recording engineers of the time insofar as he enjoyed ownership of the entire recording and post-recording process (excepting the pressing of the records themselves). This control gave Van Gelder the opportunity to ensure that the final records reflected the sound of the original tape recording, with each record bearing his hallmark: a small &#x27;RVG&#x27; inscribed into the run-out area. 

Though instrumental in developing the so-called &#x27;Blue Note sound&#x27;, Van Gelder&#x27;s approach was often dictated by the production personnel with whom he worked. Blue Note&#x27;s Alfred Lion worked closely with Van Gelder during sessions: 

Such close supervision rarely applied when Van Gelder was recording for other labels, such as Prestige or Savoy, enabling him to explore and pioneer new sound engineering techniques: 
Despite his prominence in recording jazz, some artists avoided Van Gelder&#x27;s studio. The bassist and composer Charles Mingus refused to record with him. Taking Leonard Feather&#x27;s &quot;blindfold test&quot; in 1960, he said that Van Gelder &quot;tries to change people&#x27;s tones. I&#x27;ve seen him do it; I&#x27;ve seen him do it; I&#x27;ve seen him take Thad Jones and the way he sets him up at the mike, he can change the whole sound. That&#x27;s why I never go to him; he ruined my bass sound&quot;. Even Blue Note president and producer Alfred Lion criticized Van Gelder for what Lion felt was his occasional overuse of reverb, and would jokingly refer to this trait as a &quot;Rudy special&quot; on tape boxes.

Richard Cook called Van Gelder&#x27;s characteristic method of recording and mixing the piano &quot;as distinctive as the pianists&#x27; playing&quot; itself. This unique sonic quality is considered a key component of the Van Gelder sound. Such a piano sound was initially the consequence of recording in a living room rather than a purpose built recording facility, where close miking of the piano strings was necessary to avoid sound bleed from other instruments. Though creating a distinctive albeit compressed piano sound, critics of the Van Gelder sound of the 1950s and 1960s have focused on Van Gelder&#x27;s recording of pianos as a particular source of criticism:
Van Gelder has also been criticized for his use of compression and high-frequency boosting, both of which, it is argued, compromise the sound. Journalist and radio producer George Hicks wrote:

Writer Stanley Crouch argued in an interview with Ethan Iverson that Van Gelder made particular adjustments to the sound of John Coltrane&#x27;s tenor saxophone sound when engineering Coltrane&#x27;s Impulse Records sessions: &quot;I know the difference between the sound of someone in person and the recorded sound of an engineer. Coltrane&#x27;s tone was much darker and thicker than the sound on those Impulse! records engineered by Rudy Van Gelder. But maybe Van Gelder chose that sound because he could hear that Coltrane was an alto player first before switching to tenor.&quot;

==Reputation==
Within a few years of opening his studio, Van Gelder was in demand by many other independent labels based around New York City, such as Prestige Records. Bob Weinstock, owner of Prestige, recalled the following in 1999: &quot;Rudy was very much an asset. His rates were fair and he didn&#x27;t waste time. When you arrived at his studio he was prepared. His equipment was always ahead of its time and he was a genius when it came to recording&quot;. According to a &quot;JazzTimes&quot; article in August 2016, &quot;jazz lore has formed the brands into a yin and yang of sorts: The Blue Note albums involved more original music, with rehearsal and the stringent, consistent oversight of Lion; Weinstock was more nonchalant, organizing what were essentially blowing sessions for some of the best musicians in jazz history&quot;. Van Gelder said in 2012, &quot;Alfred was rigid about how he wanted Blue Note records to sound. But Bob Weinstock of Prestige was more easygoing, so I&#x27;d experiment on his dates and use what I learned on the Blue Note sessions&quot;. He also worked for Savoy Records in this period, among others. &quot;To accommodate everyone, I assigned different days of the week to different labels&quot;.

Writer Fred Kaplan has argued that Van Gelder&#x27;s reputation with the record-buying public was aided by Blue Note Records&#x27; conspicuous mentions of Van Gelder on their album covers:
==Awards and honors==
*In 2009 he was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts.
* In 2012 he received the Grammy Trustees Award.
*In 2013 Van Gelder received the Audio Engineering Society&#x27;s Gold Medal.

<doc id="1106573" wikidata="Q181266" url="?curid=1106573" title="Tour of the Basque Country">
<text>The Tour of the Basque Country (Officially: &quot;Itzulia Basque Country&quot;) is an annual road cycling stage race held in the Spanish Basque Country in April. It is one of the races that make up the UCI World Tour calendar. As the Basque Country is a mountainous area, there are few flat stages, and thus the event favors those who are strong climbers. The race is characterized by its short stages, rarely exceeding 200 km, and steep ascents. While the ascents featured in the race are not particularly high compared to other stage races, they are among the steepest seen in professional cycling, some having sections with gradients reaching well above 20%.

==History==
The original Tour of the Basque Country had a troubled history, with eight editions contested between 1924 and 1935, before the Spanish Civil War seemingly wiped it out for good. One of these early editions is commentated on in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1926 novel &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;.

In 1952, the Eibar Cycling Club (erstwhile backers of Spain&#x27;s first national stage race, the pre-Vuelta a España &quot;Gran Premio República&quot;) launched a new 3-day event called &quot;Gran Premio de la Bicicleta Eibarresa&quot; to celebrate its 25th anniversary. Former French national champion Louis Caput took the inaugural edition.

In 1969, organizers opted to promote the race (by then five stages long) as &quot;IX Vuelta al País Vasco - XVIII Bicicleta Eibarresa&quot;, effectively merging the Bicicleta Eibarresa into a reborn Tour of the Basque Country. However, the palmares of the Bicicleta Eibarresa (featuring Vuelta a España winners Jesús Loroño and Rolf Wolfshohl) is not recognized as part of the Tour of the Basque Country&#x27;s history. The Eibar Cycling Club would relinquish control of the competition following the 1973 edition, while retaining the rights to the &quot;Bicicleta Eibarresa&quot; name, which has sporadically been reactivated to help promote other, lower ranked events.

The first winner of the Tour of the Basque Country was Francis Pélissier from France, while the first winner of the &#x27;modern&#x27; Tour (1969) was Jacques Anquetil, also of France. The most successful riders in the history of the Tour are Spain&#x27;s José Antonio González, who won the race four times in 1972, 1975, 1977 and 1978, and Spain&#x27;s Alberto Contador, who also won the race four times in 2008, 2009, 2014 and 2016. Since its revival in 1969, it has been held every year with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

From 2022, the race has a counterpart in the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour - the Itzulia Women. 

The winner traditionally dons a basque beret on the podium.

<text>William Lloyd Harding (October 3, 1877 – December 17, 1934) was an American Republican politician. He was the 22nd Governor of Iowa, from 1917 to 1921.

==Early life==
William Lloyd Harding, was born in Sibley, Iowa, on October 3, 1877. He later lived in Sioux City. From 1897 to 1901, he attended Morningside College, and then went on to earn his law degree from the University of South Dakota.

==Political career==
Harding entered politics in 1906, serving as a Republican member of the Iowa House of Representatives, a position he held for six years. He also served as Iowa&#x27;s lieutenant governor from 1913 to 1917 during the terms of Republican governor George W. Clarke. Harding won the 1916 Republican gubernatorial nomination and then won the election in a landslide (winning 98 of 99 counties.) He was sworn into the governor&#x27;s office on January 11, 1917.

Harding was reelected to a second term in 1918 and thus was governor during the four years which roughly coincided with World War I. During that time, there were &quot;defense councils&quot; in every state, following President Wilson&#x27;s famous statement &quot;the world must be made safe for democracy&quot;, and &quot;millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy live amongst us...Should there be any disloyalty it will be dealt with a firm hand of repression.&quot;

Harding was convinced that assimilation would heighten patriotism and felt there is a connection between communication and assimilation. He also claimed that any foreign language provided an opportunity for the enemy to scatter propaganda. Harding became the only governor in the United States to outlaw the public use of all foreign languages. He addressed those issues in an edict whose title was the Babel Proclamation, which prohibited all public communication in any language other than English. It forbade the use of foreign languages in public, over the telephone, in school, and in religious services. In response to complaints from pastors, Harding stated that &quot;there is no use in anyone wasting his time praying in languages other than English. God is listening only to the English tongue.&quot;

Harding&#x27;s time in office was marred by scandal and controversy. His hostility towards immigrants and foreign ethnic groups extended beyond Germans and included Iowans of Norwegian and Danish descent.

==Censure==
An investigation revealed an alleged bribe of $5,000 for the Governor&#x27;s pardon of a felon convicted of rape. Several resignations resulted, and an impeachment proposal was initiated but denied. A censure motion was approved by a vote of 70-34. He did not run again in 1920.

<text>New Zealand&#x27;s Exchange (), known commonly as the NZX, is the national stock exchange for New Zealand and a publicly owned company. NZX is the parent company of Smartshares, and Wealth Technologies.
, the NZX had a total of 179 listed securities with a combined market value of 184.62billion.

==History==

NZX began life as a number of regional stock exchanges during the gold rush of the 1860s. The first brokers’ association was started in Dunedin in 1867, then in Otago in 1868, Auckland in 1872, Wellington in 1882. The Dunedin Brokers’ Association became a stock exchange in 1893, then Christchurch gained an exchange in 1900. Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Thames and Wellington formed the Stock Association of New Zealand in 1915, joined by Taranaki in 1916, Invercargill in 1920 and Gisborne in 1922. The Stock Association of New Zealand set up a sub-committee to investigate setting up a national stock exchange. In 1983 the regional exchanges were amalgamated to form a national stock exchange, the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE).

On 24 June 1991, NZSE implemented a computerised trading system, replacing the open outcry trading floors. This computerised system was replaced with the FASTER trading and settlement system in the late 1990s. NZX Clearing was launched in 2010 to take over clearing and settlement operations.

On 16 October 2002 the member firms of the New Zealand Stock Exchange voted in favour of demutualisation, and on 31 December 2002, NZSE became a limited liability company. On 30 May 2003, the New Zealand Stock Exchange Limited formally changed its name to the New Zealand Exchange Limited, trading as NZX, and on 3 June 2003 listed its own securities on its main equity market.

Mark Weldon was chief executive officer from 2002 to May 2012. Tim Bennett was CEO from May 2012 to 31 December 2016. NZX&#x27;s Head of Markets, Mark Peterson, became interim CEO in January 2017, and permanent CEO from April 2017.

The NZX Centre building was originally constructed in 1907 for the C&amp;A Odlin Timber Company, and is one of few surviving Edwardian industrial buildings in Wellington.

The New Zealand Exchange was subject to online distributed denial-of-service attacks that disrupted trading for five days commencing on 25 August 2020. A group of &quot;DDOS extortionists&quot; demanded an unspecified ransom be paid in Bitcoin or they would continue the attacks. The New Zealand Exchange ruled out paying the ransom and sought assistance from internet service provider Spark New Zealand and the country&#x27;s signals intelligence agency Government Communications Security Bureau.

==Principal activities==
The NZX involves itself in a number of activities. It operates and regulates securities and derivative markets and provides trading, post-trading and data services for securities and derivatives, as well as the providing a central securities depository. The NZX is the only registered securities exchange in New Zealand and is also an authorised futures exchange. Its wholly owned subsidiary, the New Zealand Clearing and Depository Corporation, is the operator of a designated settlement system under part 5 of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989.

NZX provides passive funds management products through the Smartshares family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and is a provider of superannuation, KiwiSaver and investment products through SuperLife, which it acquired in 2015.

The NZX is also the market operator for New Zealand&#x27;s wholesale electricity market and the Fonterra Shareholders’ Market, under contract from the Electricity Authority and Fonterra respectively.

== Trading hours ==
The main trading board is typically open from 10 am to 4:45 pm.

==NZX as a Company==
NZX itself is a publicly traded company listed on NZX. In 2022, the company reported issued the following financial statement:

<text>Caergwrle () is a village in the county of Flintshire, in north east Wales. Approximately from Wrexham and situated on the A541 road, it is contiguous with the villages of Abermorddu and Hope, though in parts Caergwrle and Hope are separated by a river border. The village lies on the River Alyn and sits at the base of Hope Mountain. At the 2001 Census, the population was 1,650. The population was subsequently absorbed in the community of Hope and only the electoral ward remained. The population of this ward as taken at the 2011 census was 1,619. The ward includes the area of Abermorddu. Further south is the village of Cefn-y-Bedd.

== Origins of name ==
The name &quot;Caergwrle&quot; derives from the Welsh &quot;caer&quot; &#x27;fort&#x27; and a lost English placename *&quot;Corley&quot; &#x27;river meadow of the crane&#x27;. Folk etymology explained the name by means of a &quot;cawr&quot; (&#x27;giant&#x27;) named &quot;Gwrle&quot;, who was supposed to have lived in nearby Caergwrle Castle and to have been buried in the nearby Neolithic burial mound at Cefn-y-bedd.

==Caergwrle Castle==

The 13th-century, ruined Caergwrle Castle, also sometimes known as Queen&#x27;s Hope Castle, was first built by Tywysog (Prince) Dafydd ap Gruffydd, in lands agreed with Edward I of England during his invasion of Wales in 1277. Dafydd, in agreeing not to resist the invasion, had extensive improvements made to his castle at Edward&#x27;s expense. In 1282 however, Dafydd bought his time and raised the banner of revolt, marching on Hawarden Castle controlled by Edward&#x27;s invaders. Dafydd and his men seized the castle. 

When Dafydd was executed on 3 October 1283 by King Edward I, Edward took control of the castle, and gave it to his Queen, Eleanor of Castile, which prompted the name Queen&#x27;s Hope.

==Other features of Caergwrle==
The 17th-century Packhorse Bridge, which is reputed to be haunted, was nearly destroyed by flooding in 2000, though it has since been restored. There have been many other developments and restorations in Caergwrle.

Caergwrle was also home to a Welsh International football player George Alfred Godding who played from 17 March 1923 to 14 April 1923 with two caps for Wales.

Caergwrle&#x27;s long association with the adjacent village of Hope has given rise to a well-known local joke: &quot;Live in Hope, die in Caergwrle&quot;. This was already described as an &quot;old saying&quot; in the 19th century, when it was recorded by the antiquarian John Askew Roberts.

==Transport==
===Rail===
The service from Wrexham Central to Bidston passes through Caergwrle railway station. Bidston provides a connection to Liverpool via the Wirral Line. Caergwrle railway station is managed by Transport for Wales as of Autumn 2018.

===Bus===
Caergwrle has bus links giving access to Mold, Broughton, Wrexham and Chester.

==The Caergwrle Bowl==

The Caergwrle Bowl is a unique object dating to the Middle Bronze Age, c. 1300 BC, originally manufactured from shale, tin and gold. It is thought to represent a boat, with its applied gold decoration signifying oars and waves, and either sun discs or circular shields. Some researchers have suggested that the Caergwrle Bowl represents a mythological solar boat. Similarities have been noted with the contemporary miniature gold boats from Nors in Denmark, and with the later Broighter gold boat from Ireland. The Caergwrle bowl has also been related to the earlier Nebra sky disc from Germany, which is thought to depict a solar boat. Gold lunulae from the Early Bronze Age Beaker culture, including examples from Wales, have also been interpreted as representations of solar boats. The gold cape from Mold, which dates from the same period as the Nebra sky disc, was found near to Caergwrle.

The incomplete bowl was found in 1823 by a workman digging a drain in a field below Caergwrle Castle. It was donated to the National Museum Wales in 1912, and sent to the British Museum for restoration where it was originally reconstructed from wax with the decoration attached by an adhesive. Since then the bowl has been rebuilt again as the first conservation failed to be stable.

<text>USS &quot;S-35&quot; (SS-140) was an S-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-35&quot;′s keel was laid down on 14 June 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in San Francisco, California. She was launched on 27 February 1919, sponsored by Miss Louise C. Bailey, and commissioned on 17 August 1922.

==Service history==
===1922–1941===
Engaged in trials as improved engines were developed for her class, &quot;S-35&quot; was ordered to New London, Connecticut, in September, for alterations by the prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company. Decommissioned and delivered to that company on 25 October, she was accepted and recommissioned on 7 May 1923. Exercises along the East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea followed and, in early August, she arrived at San Diego, California, her home port until 1925. Then transferred to the Asiatic Fleet, she departed from San Francisco, California, in mid-April and arrived at the Submarine Base, Cavite, Philippine Islands, on 12 July.

&quot;S-35&quot; operated in Philippine waters, conducting patrols and participating in type, division, and fleet exercises until the spring of 1926. Then she sailed, with her division, for the China coast. Through the summer and into the fall, she conducted similar operations out of Tsingtao; and, in November she returned to the Philippines where, after overhaul, she resumed local operations.

She maintained a similar schedule of winter operations in the Philippines and summer deployments in Chinese waters through 1931. On 2 May 1932, she moved east, instead of north, and at the end of the month, arrived at Pearl Harbor where she joined the Pacific Fleet and commenced a schedule of exercises, overhauls, and fleet problems which took her into the 1940s.

In 1934, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the highest merit in battle torpedo practice of submarines.
In April 1941, she was transferred to San Diego, California, and, for the remaining months of peace, she provided services for the West Coast Sound School.

===World War II===
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 brought the United States into World War II, &quot;S-35&quot; added defensive patrol work to her duties; and, in January 1942, she moved north to Mare Island, California.. for limited modernization and overhaul. In late March 1942, she continued northward and, in early April, arrived at the newly established submarine base at Dutch Harbor.

==== First war patrol ====
On 12 April, she cleared Dutch Harbor and moved toward the Kuril Islands for her first war patrol. On 21 and 22 April, snow and fog covered her approach to Paramushiro and Onekotan Strait. On 23 April, she sighted and was sighted by, a large enemy submarine on the surface. Both submarines submerged. Explosions were felt in &quot;S-35&quot;. The blasts forced her down further than expected, but she regained control at 220 feet, returned to her intended depth; and maneuvered out of the immediate area.

The weather cleared on 24 April, and Paramushiro was sighted for the first time. Two days later, however, the S-boat was en route to her secondary station north of Attu. On arrival on 27 April, a ship&#x27;s cook was discovered to have mumps and a course was set for Dutch Harbor. Isolation was impossible, and half the crew had not had the disease.

Three days later, &quot;S-35&quot; returned to her Unalaska base. The crew received medical attention, the boat was scrubbed down and refitted; and requests for modern equipment, including sonar and radar, were made.

==== Second war patrol ====
Toward the end of May, the submarine was ready for sea; and, on 28 April, she moved west in response to intelligence reports of a Japanese invasion force bound for the western Aleutian Islands.

On station by 30 April, she patrolled on the surface with no contacts, through 2 June. On the morning of 3 June, word of the bombing of Dutch Harbor was received. Aerial contacts, both friendly and enemy became frequent; but the submarine was not attacked.

On 11 June, she was ordered back to Dutch Harbor to replenish; thence, she was routed to the western part of the archipelago for offensive operations near Kiska which had been taken by the Japanese. On 14 June, she approached the island and patrolled between there and Segula until 23 June. She then participated in the search for sister ship , which had run aground on Amchitka Island; returned to her patrol area late on 25 June; and, on 29 June, returned to Dutch Harbor. The thick fog which had shielded the Japanese force as it crossed the Bering Sea had remained over the Aleutians during her patrol, impairing visibility and hindering her offensive efforts.

==== Third war patrol ====
On 14 July, &quot;S-35&quot; got underway again and, through the end of the month, patrolled the Japanese supply lanes to Kiska. She then headed back toward Dutch Harbor, but was diverted north and west of the island to provide weather reporting services to the force scheduled to bombard Kiska on 7 August. After the raid, she returned to Dutch Harbor, thence proceeded to San Diego, where for six weeks she underwent overhaul and provided services to the sound school.

==== Fourth war patrol ====
On 20 October, she returned to Unalaska; and, on 26 October, she cleared the harbor for her fourth war patrol. From then until her return on 22 November, she battled heavy seas, storms, and problems arising from her inadequate and outmoded equipment as she hunted the Paramushiro-Attu-Kiska convoy routes. On 25 November, she returned to Dutch Harbor.

==== Fifth war patrol ====

Cold weather added icing to the climatic hazards of the northern Pacific Ocean; but, on 11 December, &quot;S-35&quot; headed out of Dutch Harbor again. On 15 December, she commenced operations to intercept enemy traffic to Attu and Kiska; but, on 17 December, a case of acute appendicitis forced her to Adak, Alaska, where she was to transfer the sick man to seaplane tender for treatment. On 18 December, she approached the rendezvous point but was sighted by enemy planes. On the morning of 19 December, she completed the transfer; then resumed patrol east of Kiska. On the afternoon of 21 December, she ran into a storm while surfaced off Amchitka; and, by early evening, waves were smashing over the bridge and cascading into the control room. The conning tower hatch was ordered shut. Almost simultaneously, another huge wave crashed over the bridge, flinging the captain, Lieutenant H. S. Monroe, into the hatch. Injured, Monroe retired to his quarters, only to be roused a short time later, about 18:30, by cries of &quot;fire&quot; in the control room.

Electric arcs and blue flames spewed out of the main power cables coming from the forward battery. Smoke filled the room; and water, which had caused the fire by soaking cables and causing a short, rose in the control room bilges. The fire was extinguished in the control room but immediately broke out in the forward battery. Fire extinguishers had no effect. The forward two compartments were abandoned and the battery was secured. Fire again broke out in the control room; and, as in the forward battery, extinguishers were of little help. Smoke filled the control room. The engines were stopped. The room was abandoned and sealed. Short circuits spread. Electrical equipment was disabled. A hole was burned in the top of the Number Two main ballast tank and lines from two air banks were severed.

At about 18:55, unsuccessful attempts to reenter the control room, using escape lungs, were made. Shortly thereafter, two volunteers, using oxygen charged lungs, entered the room; flooded the magazines; partially blew the Number Three main ballast tank to gain more freeboard; and shut the auxiliary induction to seal the forward battery.

The fight to save the submarine continued. The engines were started again; a fire extinguisher watch was set over the section of cable still arcing; and a bucket brigade was organized to assist in keeping down the water level. By 20:00, all extinguishers had been emptied. But &quot;S-35&quot;, under manual control, was moving east.

The morning of 22 December brought new fires. Twice, at 07:00 and at 11:00, eruptions forced the crew to the bridge. But the same flares apparently contributed to the fire&#x27;s burning itself out. After the second, the forward battery was sufficiently discharged and the cables sufficiently ruptured to prevent further fire in the control room. Smoke from the forward battery compartment, however, continued to be a problem until she entered Kuluk Bay and the battery was disconnected. Arriving at noon on 24 December, the boat was ventilated; medical help was obtained; four men were hospitalized; and mattresses, bedding, and clothing were dried.

On 29 December, &quot;S-35&quot; made her way, under escort, into Dutch Harbor. Usable equipment was removed for installation in other S-boats, and, on 14 January 1943 she began the long trip to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs. Arriving at Bremerton, Washington on 29 January, repairs took her into the spring. From 20–31 May, she conducted post repair trials; and, on 3 June, she moved north again.

For heroism and devotion to duty in saving the submarine and her crew Lieutenant Commander Stone and Chief Electrician&#x27;s Mate Frederick H. Barbero were awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for non-combat heroism.

==== Sixth war patrol ====
Arriving at Dutch Harbor on 11 June, she once more made her way west on 17 June. Despite numerous material casualties, which slowed her to an average speed of a little more than 5 knots, she continued toward the Kuril Islands and arrived in her patrol area on 25 June. On 26 June, she transited Onekotan Strait; and, on 27 June, she sighted her first target of the patrol, a large Japanese freighter. The target, however, soon outdistanced the World War I-design submarine and disappeared into the ever-present fog.

Material defects continued to cause problems. Her starboard engine soon went out of commission; and, as repair work was started, a freighter and a destroyer were sighted approaching on a course which would bring them over her position. A half hour later, the two enemy ships passed overhead, one to port, the other to starboard. Repair work was then resumed.

By dawn of 29 June, the engine was again operable; and, on 30 June, &quot;S-35&quot; shifted north to Araido, thence proceeded to the Kamchatka Peninsula, whence she moved back down the coast and covered Shimushu Strait, Paramushiro Strait, and Araido Strait.

On 1 July, she found a clear area in the fog and sighted a fishing tender awaiting the return of its trawlers. At 18:02, she fired two torpedoes at ten-second intervals; watched the first hit; and saw the second porpoising haphazardly through the water toward the target. At 18:06, she fired a third torpedo and watched the target explode and list heavily to starboard. By 18:21, the 5430-ton &quot;Banshu Maru Number Seven&quot; had disappeared, but others remained in the area where she had been. &quot;S-35&quot; reloaded and turned to firing position; but, by 18:25, the new targets had receded into the fog. Five minutes later, fast screws were heard; and the submarine began evasive tactics and cleared the area.

On 2 July, &quot;S-35&quot; received orders to shift to the convoy routes leading to southern Paramushiro. Arriving on 4 July, she remained through 16 July. Clear weather arrived with dawn of the last day, and, that afternoon, the submarine sighted a destroyer patrolling in concert, apparently, with a flying boat. As the flying boat disappeared toward its base, &quot;S-35&quot; prepared to attack. At 15:41, she began her approach on the destroyer. At about 15:42, the destroyer sighted her. She went deep. For the remainder of the day and well into the night, the two adversaries maneuvered for position: &quot;S-35&quot; evading depth charges and attempting to gain a favorable firing position; the destroyer keeping the submarine on evasive tactics and attempting to pinpoint her location and deliver a decisive depth charge. Success went to neither side.

On the morning of 17 July, &quot;S-35&quot; cleared the area and headed back toward the Aleutians. On 21 July, she arrived at Attu; and, on 25 July, she moored in Dutch Harbor. During the patrol, she had had only five clear days; four had been partially clear, the remainder had been foggy with poor to very poor visibility.

==== Seventh war patrol ====
On 6 August, &quot;S-35&quot; began her seventh war patrol. Standing out of Dutch Harbor, she made for Attu, topped off in Massacre Bay; then proceeded to her patrol area. On 11 August, she sighted a ship, but was unable to close. On 19 August, cracks developed in the port engine crankshaft and couplings; and she turned back for Dutch Harbor. Overhaul followed her return; and on 26 November, she was again ready to hunt in the Kurils. Underway that day, she arrived on station on 8 December, and for the next ten days, encountered heavy seas, snow, and &quot;mild icing&quot; as she searched waters off Onekotan and in the Sōya-Araido and
Omintao-Mushashi-Kashiwabara shipping lanes. On 19 December, she shifted north; reconnoitered the Kamchatka peninsula; then, headed home. En route, engineering defects again became critical, and almost 20 hours were spent in repairs. On 25 December, she arrived at Attu; and, on 30 December, she entered Dutch Harbor to complete her last war patrol.

==== January 1944–March 1945====
Fleet submarines now replaced the World War I-designed types. The Aleutian S-boats, as with those operating in other areas, were reassigned to training duty or designated for inactivation. &quot;S-35&quot; was assigned to Pearl Harbor where she arrived in mid-February 1944 and immediately commenced training operations. In the spring, she was ordered to the Marshall Islands. Through the summer, she provided training services out of Majuro and Eniwetok, then returned to Pearl Harbor. In January 1945, she proceeded to San Diego for inspection and repairs, and, in February, she returned to Oahu for use as a damage control school ship.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
Decommissioned on 19 March 1945, she served as a school ship and then as a target ship. Her hulk was sunk by torpedo fire on 4 April 1946. Her remains were located by the Lost 52 Project as announced on 4 August 2020.

<text>Oinousses (, alternative forms: &quot;Aignousa&quot; (Αιγνούσα) or &quot;Egnousa&quot; (Εγνούσα)) is a barren cluster of 1 larger and 8 smaller islands some off the north-east coast of the Greek island of Chios and west of Turkey. Administratively the islands form a municipality within the Chios regional unit, which is part of the North Aegean region. The principal town of the islands and seat of the municipality is also called Oinousses. Oinousses has a small resident population, living primarily in the island&#x27;s town of Oinousses, and a recently built monastery. The town is centred on a square and a small port; it includes a school, several churches, a Naval high school and a maritime museum. The only other populated settlements are Kástron and Aspalathrókampos.

==Employment==
The vast majority of the workforce of the island is engaged in seafaring, fishing and goat-herding.

The islands are noted as the origin of an unusual cluster of successful ship-owning families: the Lemos, Pateras, Hadjipateras, Samonas,Kollakis and Lyras families. Whilst most of the families now live elsewhere most of the year, the islands and town are well maintained with a strong naval connection. Oinoussians abroad are noted for their successful entrepreneurial skills in the industrial transportation industry. Although the number of Oinoussian ship operating companies has fallen since their heyday in the 1960s, they still maintain a formidable position in the industrial transportation industry.

==The islands of the complex==
The Oinousses Complex comprises the below islands. The largest is Oinousses or Egnoussa (14.3 km2), the second-largest is the islet Pasas or Panagia (2.5 km2) and the third-largest is the islet of Vatos. The municipality has an area of 17.427 km2.

<text>Frog Records is a British independent record label that specializes in remastering and reissuing jazz, blues, and jug band music. Since 2004 the company has been owned by record producer Paul Swinton. He also publishes the &quot;Frog Blues and Jazz Annual&quot;.

The Frog catalog includes the complete recordings of Bessie Smith, King Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Dixieland Jug Blowers, Thomas Morris, Memphis Jug Band, New Orleans Owls, and The Washingtonians (Duke Ellington&#x27;s earliest recordings).

The label was formed in 1994 by jazz collector David French, who died in 2004, and friends who sought recordings from around the world to reissue, though mostly in the U.S. Many CDs have been remastered by audio engineers led by John R. T. Davies, Charlie Crump, and Nick Dellow.

<doc id="1106630" wikidata="Q7741397" url="?curid=1106630" title="The Ill-Made Knight">
<text>The Ill-Made Knight is a fantasy novel by British writer T. H. White, the third book in the series &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;. It was first published in 1940, but is usually found today only in collected editions of all four books of the novel.

==Plot summary==
Much of &quot;The Ill-Made Knight&quot; takes place mainly in Camelot, and tells of the adventures, perils and mistakes of Sir Lancelot. Despite being the bravest of the knights, Lancelot is ugly and ape-like, and calls himself the &quot;Chevalier mal fet&quot;, &quot;The Ill-Made Knight&quot;. As a boy Lancelot loved King Arthur and trained to be a knight of the Round Table. When he arrives and becomes one of Arthur&#x27;s knights he also becomes the king&#x27;s close friend. This causes some tension, as he is jealous of Arthur&#x27;s new wife, Guinevere. In order to please her husband Guinevere tries to befriend Lancelot and the two eventually fall in love. T.H. White&#x27;s version of the tale elaborates on the passionate love of Lancelot and Guinevere. Suspense is provided by the tension between Lancelot&#x27;s friendship for King Arthur and his love affair with the queen. This affair leads inevitably to the breaking of the Round Table and sets up the tragedy that is to follow in the concluding book of the tetralogy, &quot;The Candle in the Wind&quot;.

Lancelot leaves Camelot to aid people in need. Along the way he meets a woman who begs him to climb a tree and rescue her husband&#x27;s escaped falcon. After he removes his armour and does so the husband appears and reveals that he wanted Lancelot to remove his armour so that he can kill the knight. Despite being at a disadvantage, Lancelot manages to kill the man and tells the wife: &quot;Stop crying. Your husband was a fool and you are a bore. I&#x27;m not sorry&quot; (though he reflects that he is). Later he comes across a man attempting to murder his wife for adultery. Lancelot attempts to protect the woman, who denies the charge, by riding in between the two, but the man manages to cut off his wife&#x27;s head. The man then throws himself at Lancelot&#x27;s feet and asks for mercy. It is revealed later that the man is punished by being charged to take his wife&#x27;s head to the Pope and ask for forgiveness. Finally, Lancelot comes to a town where the inhabitants beg him to rescue a young woman named Elaine, who is trapped in a tower. The tower is full of steam and she is forced to sit in a tub of boiling water. He manages to save her and her father has him spend the night. The servants and Elaine devise a plan in which the servants get Lancelot drunk and trick him into thinking that Guinevere is in the house. When he awakens in the morning he discovers that he has slept with Elaine. Furious at the loss of his virginity, which he believes has also cost him the ability to work miracles, and frightened at the thought that Elaine might have a baby, he leaves. He confesses the affair to Guinevere, who forgives him. They later discover that Elaine has a baby, which she names Galahad (Lancelot&#x27;s real name). She brings the baby to Camelot to show to Lancelot and together they spend time with Galahad. Guinevere is furious at this and Lancelot goes mad and runs from the castle. Two years later he is found by Elaine&#x27;s father, who does not recognise him, and is kept as a fool until Elaine recognises him. He lives with Elaine for some time, but then returns to Camelot. When Galahad grows older he is brought to Camelot to be knighted.

&quot;The Ill-Made Knight&quot; also deals with the quest for the Holy Grail. Arthur notices that the drop in crime has caused the Knights of the Round Table to fall back into their old habits, especially Gawaine, Agravaine, and Mordred, who find their mother in bed with one of King Pellinore&#x27;s sons and murder both of them. In order to give the Knights a new goal Arthur sends them to find the Holy Grail. The quest ends when Sir Galahad, Sir Percival, Sir Bors, and Sir Pellinore&#x27;s daughter find the Grail. Sir Lancelot sees the four in a room, with the Grail, an old man, and several other knights, but he is unable to enter the room himself. One of the knights returns with the news that the Grail could not be brought to England and as a result Sir Galahad and the other knight brought it to Babylon (and neither of them could return to England as well). Sir Pellinore&#x27;s daughter died when she allowed her blood to be taken to cure a dying princess.

Elaine commits suicide after Lancelot tells her that he will not return to stay with her permanently. The book ends with Lancelot performing a miracle, even though he is not a virgin, which is the usual requirement for being able to do so.

==Quotations==
:“The boy [Lancelot] thought that there was something wrong with him. All throughout his life—even when he was a great man with the world at his feet—he was to feel this gap: something at the bottom of his heart of which he was aware, and ashamed, but which he did not understand ... We do not have to dabble in a place which he preferred to keep secret.&quot;</text><links>

<text>&quot;Intruder in the Dust &quot; is a 1948 crime novel written by American author William Faulkner. Taking place in Mississippi, it revolves around an African-American farmer accused of murdering a Caucasian man. 

==Overview==
The novel focuses on Lucas Beauchamp, a black farmer accused of murdering a white man. He is exonerated through the efforts of black and white teenagers and a spinster from a long-established Southern family. It was written as Faulkner&#x27;s response as a Southern writer to the racial problems facing the South. 

&quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; is notable for its use of stream of consciousness style of narration. The novel also includes lengthy passages on the Southern memory of the American Civil War, one of which Shelby Foote quoted in Ken Burns&#x27; 1990 documentary &quot;The Civil War&quot;.

The characters of Lucas Beauchamp and his wife, Molly, first appeared in Faulkner&#x27;s collection of short fiction, &quot;Go Down, Moses&quot;. A story by Faulkner, &quot;Lucas Beauchamp&quot;, was published in 1999.

The character Gavin Stevens appears as a protagonist in Faulkner&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Knight&#x27;s Gambit&quot; (1949).

&quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; was turned into a film of the same name directed by Clarence Brown in 1949 after MGM paid film rights of $50,000 to Faulkner. The film was shot in Faulkner&#x27;s home town of Oxford, Mississippi. In 1950, Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for &quot;his powerful and artistically unique contribution to the modern American novel.&quot; The Nobel Prize was not specifically for his novel &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; but for the enduring contribution of his writing as a whole.

==Analysis==
In her contemporary review of the novel, Eudora Welty noted its humor. Dayton Kohler&#x27;s 1949 article noted the book&#x27;s recognition of black Americans in the American south. John E. Bassett has commented that this novel represents a &quot;serious attempt to explore contemporary Southern racism through Gavin and Chick.&quot; Jean E. Graham has discussed the contrasting rhetorical styles of Gavin and Chick throughout the course of the novel. Ticien Marie Sassoubre has examined the novel in the context of the social issues related to lynching in the American South, and then-recent American federal law with respect to black Americans.

D. Hutchinson has elucidated the unifying literary devices of the novel. Peter J. Rabinowitz analyzed Faulkner&#x27;s use of the detective story in the context of the &quot;discovery novel&quot; as compared to Dostoyevsky.

<text>Galindo Garcés (died 844) was a Count of Aragón from 833 until his death in 844, the son and successor of García Galíndez (count of Aragón 820–833).

He left no known descendants, and the county returned to the hands of the dynasty his father had displaced, in the person of Galindo Aznárez I, who was previously Count of Urgell (830–833), Cerdanya (c. 830 – 833), Pallars (833–834), and Ribagorza (833–834). It has been speculated that nobleman Velasco Garcés, who defected from Pamplona in 842 to join Abd ar-Rahman II, might have been Galindo&#x27;s brother, and that this may have contributed to the dynasty&#x27;s replacement following Galindo&#x27;s death.

<text>Debut Records was an American jazz record company and label founded in 1952 by bassist Charles Mingus, his wife Celia, and drummer Max Roach.

This short-lived label was an attempt to avoid the compromises of working for major companies. Intended to showcase performances by new musicians, only about two dozen albums were issued before the company closed in 1957. Nonetheless, several prominent jazz musicians made their first recordings as leaders for Debut, including pianist Paul Bley, and trumpeters Kenny Dorham and Thad Jones. Saxophonist Hank Mobley made his recording debut on the label, as a sideman with Roach. Teo Macero, later a producer with Miles Davis, recorded his first album as a leader as a saxophonist for Debut, an album described by critic Dan Morgenstern as an oddball fusion of Lennie Tristano and Anton Webern.

Debut was the label on which the &quot;Jazz at Massey Hall&quot; concert album was first issued. Recorded in Toronto, it features Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Charles Mingus, and Max Roach, and was the last recorded meeting of long-term musical partners Parker and Gillespie.

In 1957, Danish bookseller Ole Vestegaard leased the company&#x27;s catalogue from Mingus and produced recordings on the Danish Debut label by American jazz musicians who settled in Copenhagen or played at Jazzhus Montmartre.

After Celia and Charles Mingus divorced, Celia married Saul Zaentz in 1960. Charles gave the Zaentzes control of the rights to Debut catalog as a wedding gift. Mingus thought the gift fitting as Celia had handled the bulk of Debut&#x27;s business affairs, and most of the seed money came from Celia&#x27;s mother. Zaentz was later head of Fantasy Records, where the Debut recordings were subsequently reissued from 1962–1964.

A 12-CD set of the Debut recordings featuring Mingus, the majority of the label&#x27;s output, was issued by Fantasy Records in 1990. A four-CD sequence entitled &quot;Mingus Rarities&quot; (Original Jazz Classics) collected some of the more obscure material featuring Mingus.

<text>The Barron River (&quot;French: rivière Barron&quot;) is a river in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin in Nipissing District and Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada. It flows from Clemow Lake in northern Algonquin Provincial Park and joins the Petawawa River, whose southern branch it forms, in the municipality of Laurentian Hills, near the municipality of Petawawa.

The river is named after Barron Township through which it flows, which in turn was named in honour of John Augustus Barron.

A popular canoe route passes through and a hiking trail leads to the edge of the Barron Canyon.

==Geography==

The river begins at Clemow Lake in the geographic township of Barron in the Unorganized South Nipissing District of Nipissing District, Northeastern Ontario. It flows southeast through Grand Lake where it is crossed by the former Canadian Northern Railway later Canadian National Railway main line, now abandoned, and where the Achray campground, formerly a station on the railway, is located on the north shore.

It passes into Stratton Township, takes in the right tributary Carcajou Creek, then flows out over the Grand Lake Dam and again under the railway to enter Stratton Lake. The river turns northeast, passes over High Falls to High Falls Lake, then heads east over Brigham Chute. It takes in the right tributary Mulock Creek, enters Master Township, passes over the Cache Rapids, and reaches the Squirrel Depot picnic area and the Squirrel Rapids.

The river heads out of Algonquin Park and Nipissing District into McKay Township, part of the municipality of Laurentian Hills in Renfrew County, Eastern Ontario. At this point the river becomes part of Barron River Provincial Park on the south side while the north shore is part of CFB Petawawa. The river passes over First Chute and reaches its mouth at Lac du Bois Dur on the Petawawa River, which flows to the Ottawa River, about west of the community of Black Bay and just before the border with the municipality of Petawawa. The Petawawa Rivers flows via the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River.

==Geology==
Approximately 10,000 years ago, the river was a main outlet for glacial meltwater in this region. It is believed to have carried for a short time the outflow from the Lake Agassiz. The deep Barron Canyon was formed during that time. The rocks exposed in the Canyon are part of the Canadian Shield. The canyon itself still shows activity in the form of rockfalls and landslides.

The Barron River lies inside a fault associated with the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben.

==History==
The river was an important highway during the last part of the 19th century and early 20th century when its water levels were carefully manipulated to facilitate the transport of timber to the Ottawa River and onwards. The Barron Canyon was the scene of noisy log drives every spring. The name the loggers used for the towering cliffs was the &quot;Capes&quot;. Moving timber in this way was a dangerous task and evidence can be found by the graves still found on the edge of the Petawawa and Barron Rivers.

==Barron River Provincial Park==
The Barron River Provincial Park includes a wide strip of land along the river&#x27;s southern bank, from the eastern boundary of Algonquin Park to Black Bay in Petawawa Township. It was established in 2006 and protects an outstanding water route that provides recreational and educational opportunities.

A notable feature in the park is the eastern part of the Barron Canyon, that provide a microclimate in its cracks and crevices for plants that are more at home in the subarctic. On top of the cliffs are red and white pine forests.

It is a non-operating park without any facilities or services. Permitted activities include boating, canoeing, fishing, and hunting.

<doc id="1106700" wikidata="Q1138838" url="?curid=1106700" title="Lin Chong">
<text>Lin Chong is a fictional character in &quot;Water Margin&quot;, one of the Four Great Classical Novels in Chinese literature. Nicknamed &quot;Panther Head&quot;, he ranks sixth among the 36 Heavenly Spirits. In some folk tales derived from the novel, he is said to have learnt martial arts from Zhou Tong, who purportedly trained the Song dynasty general Yue Fei in archery.

==Background==
Lin Chong resembles Zhang Fei, a general of the Three Kingdoms era, in appearance. Over six &quot;chi&quot; tall, he has piercing eyes and a head like that of a panther, which earns him the nickname &quot;Panther Head&quot;. He is a martial arts instructor of the Imperial Guards in Dongjing (東京; present-day Kaifeng, Henan), the imperial capital of the Song dynasty.

==Framed and exiled==
Lin Chong introduces himself to Lu Zhishen when he sees the monk working out with his hefty staff and is deeply impressed. Lu tends a vegetable plot for a temple in Dongjing. They become sworn brothers. While they are chatting, Gao Yanei, the play-boy adopted son of Grand Marshal Gao Qiu, runs into Lin Chong&#x27;s wife in a temple and tries to force himself on her. Lin rushes to the temple and saves his wife in time. Afraid of inviting trouble, he decides not to report the case to the authorities. However, besotted with Lin&#x27;s wife, Gao Yanei seeks the help of Lin&#x27;s friend Lu Qian. Lu invites Lin Chong out for a drink, during which Mrs Lin is tricked to go to Lu&#x27;s house, where Gao Yanei attempts to rape her. Mrs Lin‘s maid escapes and informs her master, who rushes to Lu Qian&#x27;s house. Gao Yanei flees upon learning that Lin is coming.

Gao Yanei asks his adoptive father to help him get hold of Lin Chong‘s wife. Knowing Lin loves good weapons, Gao Qiu sends a man to trick him to buy a rare sword on the street. The Grand Marshal then summons Lin Chong to his residence claiming that he wants to see his new possession. Lin, carrying the sword, unsuspectingly enters the White Tiger Hall, where meetings on top-secret state matters are held and arms are prohibited. Gao Qiu accuses Lin of wanting to assassinate him and orders his arrest.

Lin Chong is tattooed on the face and exiled to Cangzhou. Before he is on the way, he insists on divorcing his wife so that she can find a better husband. Meanwhile, Gao Qiu bribes the two guards escorting Lin Chong to kill him along the way. During the journey, the escorts mistreat Lin, including scalding his feet at one point. At Wild Boar Forest, just as they are about to kill Lin after tying him to a tree, Lu Zhishen springs out from behind the trunk, disarms them, and wants to finish them off. He is prevented by Lin Chong, who tells him that they are just stooges of Gao Qiu. Lu Zhishen accompanies Lin to Cangzhou and takes leave only after ensuring the escorts would try no more mischief.

In Cangzhou, Lin Chong befriends the nobleman Chai Jin. His impressive skill in thrashing a boastful and arrogant martial arts instructor, who lives off Chai, wins the scion&#x27;s admiration. Chai provides him money to bribe the jailers not to make his life in prison miserable.

==Burning of the fodder depot==
Gao Qiu sends Lu Qian and his steward Fu An to Cangzhou on a second attempt to kill Lin Chong. Lu Qian bribes the chief warden and a jailer, and they work out a plan involving assigning Lin to be a solo watchman at a fodder depot. 

On the day Lin Chong takes up his new duty, Lu Qian, Fu An and the jailer set fire to the depot after nightfall, certain that he must be trapped in the inferno. However, Lin Chong has earlier gone out to buy wine and upon return found his hut in the depot crushed under the weight of snow. He then took shelter in a nearby temple. Upon seeing that the depot is on fire, he hurries towards it. But he overhears the three men talking outside the temple and learns that the fire is their work. Enraged, he charges out, kills the three men and offers their heads to the deity of the temple. He then flees the scene.

==Becoming an outlaw==
While on the run, Lin Chong meets Chai Jin again, who suggests he joins the outlaws at Liangshan Marsh. Chai writes a recommendation letter for him addressed to Wang Lun, the chief of Liangshan. Lin comes to an inn, which is an outpost of the stronghold managed by Zhu Gui. Zhu ushers him across the marsh and up the hill.

At Liangshan, Wang Lun fears Lin Chong, with his superior fighting skill, will usurp his position, so he tries to send him away with excuse and gifts. As Lin Chong pleads to stay, Wang Lun sets the condition that he must kill a man in three days and present the person&#x27;s head as his ticket of enrolment. On the third day, Lin Chong encounters Yang Zhi and they fight to a standstill. Wang Lun comes to the scene, stops the fight, and invites Yang to join his band in the hope that he would be a counterweight to Lin Chong. But Yang declines and leaves. Wang Lun reluctantly lets Lin Chong stay and take the fourth position under himself, Du Qian and Song Wan.

When Chao Gai and his six friends come to Liangshan to seek refuge after being discovered by authorities to be the hijackers of birthday gifts in transportation to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing, Wang Lun again feels threatened. He tries to send them away with gifts. Frustrated with Wang Lun&#x27;s selfishness and incited by Wu Yong, Lin Chong kills the leader. Chao Gai is elected the new chief of Liangshan, with Lin being placed fourth after Wu Yong and Gongsun Sheng. Lin then seeks news about his wife and is sad to hear that she has hanged herself to avoid harassment by Gao Yanei.

==Death==
Lin Chong is appointed as one of the Five Tiger Generals of the Liangshan cavalry after the 108 Heroes came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. 

When Gao Qiu personally leads a military attack on Liangshan, he ends up being captured. Some later editions of &quot;Water Margin&quot; say Lin Chong wants to kill Gao for reprisal. But an earlier edition said he is resigned to his fate, no longer keen on revenge. The 120-chapter edition of &quot;Water Margin&quot; depicts him as merely staring at Gao as the latter is escorted into Liangshan&#x27;s main hall after his capture. The earlier 100-chapter edition does not even mention this. Song Jiang treats Gao as an honoured guest and releases him hoping he will obtain amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan.

After the amnesty, the Liangshan heroes are sent to fight the Liao invaders and put down the rebel forces of Tian Hu, Wang Qing, and Fang La in Song territory. Lin Chong makes significant contributions in the series of campaigns. Just when the missions are all over, Lin Chong is stricken by paralysis. He dies six months later under the care of Wu Song in Liuhe Temple in Hangzhou, where Lu Zhishen had died six months earlier.

==Cultural references==

* In the 2022 cyber thriller, Rise of the Water Margin, Lin Chong is a main protagonist and commander of China&#x27;s cyber warfare Unit 61398 who is framed, disgraced, and on the run. Hunted for a trumped-up act of treason and manslaughter, he takes refuge at a hacker enclave in one of China’s deserted “ghost cities” known by its investors as the Mount Liang Swamp.  Devastated by his wife’s suicide, he unleashes a cyber-weapon that threatens to draw China and the US into a nuclear war.

* In Beijing opera, there are two plays about Lin Chong&#x27;s journey to becoming an outlaw. The first, &quot;Wild Boar Forest&quot; (), is based on the part of Lu Zhishen saving Lin Chong from the escorts when they are about to kill him during his exile trip to Cangzhou. The second, &quot;Lin Chong Flees by Night&quot; (), is based on the burning of the fodder depot and Lin Chong&#x27;s flight to Liangshan Marsh.

*In the Japanese 1973 TV adaptation, Lin Chong (respelled &quot;Lin Chung&quot;; played by Atsuo Nakamura) is the lead character in the series, being portrayed as the unofficial leader of the Mount Liang rebels.

<text>A cortado is a Spanish beverage consisting of espresso mixed with a roughly equal amount of warm milk to reduce the acidity, although the exact ratios have considerable regional variation. The milk in a cortado is steamed, but not frothy and &quot;texturized&quot; as in many Italian coffee drinks. The cortado is commonly served all over Spain. The word &quot;cortado&quot; is the past participle of the Spanish verb (), in the sense of &#x27;dilute&#x27;, and can refer variously to either coffee or espresso drinks throughout Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries.

==Similar drinks==
In Spain a &quot;café solo corto&quot; is a small amount of black coffee (usually a single shot of espresso), while a &quot;café cortado&quot; or more commonly just a &quot;cortado&quot; is an espresso with a splash of milk. The term &quot;cortado&quot; is itself broadly associated with various coffee or espresso beverages having been &quot;cut&quot; with milk. The cortado is very similar or the same as the Italian macchiato or the French noisette. 

The &quot;cortadito&quot; in Cuba specifically implies a small beverage similar to the café solo corto consisting of a standard espresso shot; however, unlike the solo corto, the Cuban cortadito is generally cut with heated sweetened condensed milk, being a more available preserved form of milk, as fresh milk was historically often unavailable. A &quot;cortadito&quot; is usually served in a special glass, often with a metal ring base and a metal wire handle. There are several nominal variations, including &quot;cortado condensada&quot;, &quot;café con leche condensada&quot; or &quot;bombón&quot; (espresso with condensed milk); &quot;leche y leche&quot; is a similar variation, but with both condensed milk integrated throughout and a dollop of cream resting on top. Brought to the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, Florida, by Cuban-Americans in the 1960s, the cortadito drink is now found throughout the city, and is an important part of everyday culture, particularly among Cubans. However, the cortadito is a drink distinct from Cuban-style coffee, which includes sugar in addition to milk, and has its own brewing method as espresso.

In non Spanish-speaking countries where it appears on a specialty coffee menu, however, the cortado should generally be distinguished from the Italian caffè macchiato, cappuccino, or a flat white. A macchiato has only a small amount (a &#x27;mark&#x27; or spot) of milk foam added, while a cappuccino has a head from both foam and milk. A flat white is generally made with a similar equivalent ratio of espresso to milk, but uses steamed and textured (e.g. microfoam) milk, resulting in a hotter and lighter drink, more closely related to a caffè latte.

A similar drink in Australia is known as a &quot;piccolo latte,&quot; or simply a &quot;piccolo&quot;. This is a single ristretto shot in a macchiato glass that is filled with steamed milk in the same fashion as a cafe latte. A larger drink, popular in Portugal, is the &quot;galão,&quot; which uses 1:3 proportions but is otherwise similar to both cortados and manchados.

==Other names and variations==
In Catalan, &quot;tallat&quot; takes the role of describing being &quot;cut&quot;, with the closest word in Basque being &quot;ebaki&quot;, and &quot;pingado&quot; or &quot;garoto&quot; in Portuguese. In the United States the meaning of the name can vary by region but on the East Coast it is generally known as a &quot;cortado&quot;. In the Czech Republic, Costa Coffee sells cortado under the marketing name &quot;corto classic&quot;.

===Gibraltar===
The name &quot;gibraltar&quot; originated in San Francisco, where roasters – first Blue Bottle Coffee Company, later Ritual Coffee Roasters and others – started the cortado trend by serving the drink in Libbey Glass Company glassware by the same name.

Whereas a cortado is a broader term for many a cut beverage, a &quot;gibraltar&quot; is specifically defined in its proportions by the constraints of its cup size: a Libbey &quot;Gibraltar&quot; glass contains , of which are filled by a standard double espresso shot, with the remaining filled by foamy steamed milk. While some sources assert there is no distinction between a gibraltar and a cortado, establishments that offer both drinks generally differentiate the gibraltar with a richer, more velvety texture and a cooler, lukewarm temperature.

<doc id="1106703" wikidata="Q3654611" url="?curid=1106703" title="Camp Perry">
<text>Camp Perry is a National Guard training facility located on the shore of Lake Erie in northern Ohio near Port Clinton. In addition to its regular mission as a military training base, Camp Perry also boasts the second largest outdoor rifle range in the world after the NRA Whittington Center in Raton, New Mexico. The firing is done in the direction of the open water of the lake, that lies just beyond an earthen berm and the targets.

==History==
The original land for Camp Perry was purchased in 1906, and the reservation was named after Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the American naval commander who won the Battle of Put-in-Bay during the War of 1812. Rudimentary structures were constructed for use by competitors in the National Matches, and for transient military personnel. During World War I, Camp Perry served as a training center for Army officers and marksmanship instructors. Around 1918 an additional area immediately adjacent to the existing Camp Perry grounds was used to construct the Erie Army Depot for artillery ordnance storage.

In the 1920s, the facility was by the Special Police School, a tactical training facility established by the National Rifle Association and the Army&#x27;s National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice. Dubbed &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley,&quot; the Special Police School consisted of...

In 1924, the police departments of all cities with populations of over 10,000 were invited to participate in national matches at Camp Perry.

The coming of the Second World War closed the Special Police School down, and Camp Perry served as a POW camp for German and Italian prisoners. The Italian prisoners were very lightly guarded and worked alongside the civilians at the camp. They were also used as workers at various local industries and returned to the camp each night. The camp was used to test the longevity of artillery weapons. The gun barrels were measured with a very precise gauge. The guns were then fired into Lake Erie and retested to determine the amount of wear the rounds of firing caused. This enabled the Army to estimate the effective life of the weapon.

After the war prisoner quarters were converted back to use by transient personnel who were at Perry for training. In 1946 Ohio Governor Frank Lausche considered turning the camp into a college temporarily. The camp was used extensively for several years after World War II, and in 1956 the Special Police School was re-opened, but use slowed somewhat during the 1960s. The Erie Army Depot closed in the mid-1960s and was eventually converted to industrial use. However, many of Camp Perry&#x27;s original structures are still in use in one form or another. 

On June 24, 1998, a tornado damaged several buildings on the grounds.

==Present use==
Currently, Camp Perry is home to the 213th Ordnance Company (Missile Support, Corps), the 372d Missile Maintenance Company (DS) Detachment 1, the 200th RED HORSE Civil Engineering Squadron (Ohio Air National Guard), U.S. Coast Guard Port Security Unit 309, the Ohio Naval Militia (the naval arm of Ohio&#x27;s State Defense Forces), and the Ohio Military Reserve (the militia arm of Ohio&#x27;s State Defense Forces).

==Civilian Marksmanship Program==
Camp Perry has been the host of the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) and the NRA-sponsored National Rifle Matches since 1907. The National Matches, considered America&#x27;s &quot;World Series of the Shooting Sports,&quot; attracts shooting sports competitors from all across the world to compete in matches of all multitudes. Competition event shooters range from beginners to the world’s best. The National Matches include Small Arms Firing Schools, a series of CMP National Trophy Rifle and Pistol Matches, CMP Games Events and NRA national championships. The National Matches are conducted through a partnership with the CMP, the Ohio National Guard and the NRA.

The camp is home to the Small Arms Firing School, which provides shooters with expert training and facilities for improving their shooting ability. The Small Arms Firing School was first conducted by The Department of Defense as part of the National Matches at the camp in 1918. Now there are over one thousand pistol and rifle shooters a year that take part in firearms safety and fundamental marksmanship skills. The Pistol and Rifle Schools are conducted by the U. S. Army Marksmanship Unit (USAMU). The Schools are open to all United States citizens who are over the minimum age. USAMU instructors, assisted by Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy Active, National Guard and Army Reserve shooting team members teach basic marksmanship techniques to the new and less experienced, and experienced shooters who want to learn new ways to improve their scores. Camp Perry is also home to the Civilian Marksmanship Program&#x27;s north office.

<doc id="1106704" wikidata="Q442358" url="?curid=1106704" title="Casual sex">
<text>Casual sex is sexual activity that takes place outside a romantic relationship and implies an absence of commitment, emotional attachment, or familiarity between sexual partners. Examples are sexual activity while casually dating, one-night stands, prostitution or swinging and friends with benefits relationships.

== Practices ==
===Single encounters===
A one-night stand is a single sexual encounter between individuals, where at least one of the parties has no immediate intention or expectation of establishing a longer-term sexual or romantic relationship. Anonymous sex is a form of one-night stand or casual sex between people who have very little or no history with each other, often engaging in sexual activity on the same day of their meeting and usually never seeing each other again afterwards.

===Social sex===
The terms &quot;friends with benefits&quot; and &quot;booty call&quot; describe situations in which a person has sex with someone they generally consider a friend or someone they are fairly close to. They are not in an exclusive romantic relationship. The involved parties may have a degree of emotional attachment but do not want, for whatever reason, to have &quot;strings attached&quot;. 

A 2011 study, published in &quot;The Journal of Sex Research&quot;, found that two out of five single women and one out of five single men in &quot;friends with benefits&quot; relationships hoped that their relationship would eventually turn into a full-fledged romance. This stands in contrast to swinger couples who are already in long-term relationships and are only seeking compatible friends with whom they can engage in recreational sex.

Recreational sex can take place in an open marriage, among swingers (where sex is viewed as a social occasion), or in an open relationship.

===Hooking up===
A &quot;hookup&quot; (colloquial American English) is a casual sexual encounter involving physical pleasure without necessarily including emotional bonding or long-term commitment. It can range from kissing (for example, making out) to other sexual activities. The practice of hooking up became a widespread among young people in the 1980s and 1990s. Researchers say that what differentiates hooking up from casual sex in previous generations of young people is the &quot;virtual disappearance&quot; of dating, which had been dominant from the postwar period onwards. In more modern times, rather than dating, casual sex is the primary path for young people into a relationship. With the use of apps becoming more common it has become easier to hook up or meet others for sexual activity. 

With students, studies have shown that the group most likely to engage in casual sex is white middle- or upper-class heterosexuals. Black and Latino students are less likely to hook up, as are evangelical Christian students and working-class students. Data on gay and lesbian students show mixed results, as some research shows that they engage in hookups at the same rate as heterosexual students, while others suggest that it occurs less frequently because college parties are not always gay-friendly, as most hookups occur at such gatherings.

A study of hookup culture at the University of Iowa found that waiting to have sex does not contribute to a stronger future relationship. Instead, what mattered most was the goal individuals had going into a relationship. Individuals who started by hooking up tended to develop a full relationship later if that was their goal going in. Another survey revealed that the number of first dates that most college-aged students have been on is about half of the number of hookups that they have had. It has become a common dating practice for people to candidly talk about their casual sex encounters and personal views on the subject as early as the first date or meeting. Another study showed that condoms were used in only 69 out of every 100 penetrative sex hookups.

=== Swinging ===

Swingers engage in casual sex with others for a variety of reasons. For many, an advantage is the increased quality, quantity and frequency of sex. Some swingers engage in casual sex to add variety to their otherwise conventional sex lives or for curiosity. Swingers who engage in casual sex maintain that sex among swingers is often more deliberative and therefore more honest than infidelity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and a means to strengthen their relationship. Others regard such activities as merely social and recreational interaction with others. A swinger party or partner-swapping party is a gathering at which individuals or couples in a committed relationship can engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity. Swinging can take place in various contexts, ranging from a spontaneous sexual activity at an informal social gathering of friends to a regular social gathering in a sex club (or swinger club), private residence, or other pre-arranged location such as a hotel, a resort, or a cruise ship.

== History ==
=== 1920s ===
As automobile ownership boomed along with the number of options for dating venues, such as movie theaters and jazz halls, parental involvement in the courtship process began to decrease. Casual encounters became a more common occurrence in the teen and young adult dating experience. 

Religious and moralist views from the preceding decades also led to public outcry in communities and in the press, and a questioning of what was perceived as changing standards in morality among the younger generation.

Some historians suggest that sexual liberation in the 1920s was largely the product of cultural changes and evolving gender roles. More young women sought to enter college and the workplace; many left parental homes and bad marriages behind and sought independence. The automobile was more of a new, convenient means to enable coupling than a causal phenomenon.

Also, young adults of the 1920s considered Victorian-era sexual and moral codes to be oppressive; Bohemianism continued to influence and be embraced by this generation following WWI, and the liberated flapper and vamp emerged as lifestyle personas in popular culture. In the United States, &quot;petting parties&quot;, in which petting (&quot;making out&quot; or foreplay) was the main attraction, became a part of the flapper lifestyle.

The emerging movie industry, through the Pre-Code Hollywood era, furthered the rebellion against Victorian-era morals as films started depicting women owning their sexuality. Current cinema from the 1960s onward has continued this trend.

===Sexual revolution===
During the sexual revolution in the United States and Europe during the 1960s and 1970s, social attitudes to sexual issues underwent considerable changes. The advent of &quot;the pill&quot; and other forms of birth control, the Women&#x27;s Liberation movement, and the legalization of abortion in many countries are believed to have led to a wider practice of casual sex. That is also due in part to the younger generation&#x27;s rejection of their parents&#x27; dating and matrimonial ideals and the rise of college party culture. In response to that insurgence in the 1960s, single women were denied access to birth control pills by their healthcare providers. That type of pushback is consistently observed throughout studies of the evolution of American sexual morals and beliefs. Younger generations are encouraged by their elders to engage in sexual activity only if it is within the bounds of marriage and for procreative purposes.

===Contemporary===
In the United States, one-time sexual encounters among college-aged students are growing increasingly common; nearly 70% of people in that age group have partaken in casual sex at least once because of their newfound adult identities and freedom to explore their sexualities.

Data from 2007 to 2017 indicates that there has been a decline in casual sex among young adults. A 2021 study attributed the decline to reduced alcohol consumption, increased video gaming, and a larger share of young adults living with their parents.

==Prevalence and norms==
A study in 2019 found that 23% to 33% of women surveyed dated men for a free meal termed &quot;foodie call&quot;.

===Colleges===
Research suggests that as many as two thirds to three quarters of American students have casual sex at least once during college. On college campuses, casual sex may occur almost anywhere. The majority of hookups happen at parties. Other common casual sex venues are dorms, frat houses, bars, dance clubs, cars, and public places or wherever is available at the time.

Collegiate holidays and vacations, especially spring breaks, are times that undergraduates are more likely to purposely seek out casual sexual encounters and experiment with risky behaviors. This is due to the availability of alcohol and uninhibitedness of spring break venues. One study reported that about 30% of collegiate spring breakers, whether they are in a monogamous relationship or not, have penetrative sex with a person they meet during their break. A 1995 study of Canadian students who had traveled to Florida for spring break, found the key elements of a spring break vacation to include a group holiday with friends traveling and rooming together, a perpetual party atmosphere, high alcohol consumption, sexually suggestive contests and displays, and the perception that casual sex is common. Overall, there was a perception that sexual norms are far more permissive on spring break vacation than at home, providing an atmosphere of greater sexual freedom and the opportunity for engaging in new sexual experiences. Of the 681 students who completed a questionnaire after the break, 15% of males and 13% of females had engaged in casual sex during the break. Nearly 61% of men and 34% of women who had casual sex over the break had slept together within 24 hours of meeting.

===&quot;Hookup&quot; norms===
Men and women are found to engage in very similar casual sex conducts, despite popular social beliefs. Most young adults in this age group believe that their peers are having a higher frequency of casual sex than they actually are, and this is due to vocabulary choice. For example, using the term &quot;hookup&quot; denotes that the sexual activity, whether it is vaginal sex, oral sex, or manual sex, is casual and between unfamiliar partners. However, it is vague and does not detail what specific sexual activities occurred. This is especially distorting towards others&#x27; impressions because 98% of college hookups involve kissing, 81% of hookups involve more than kissing, and only 34% of hookups involve penetrative sex. Studies have also linked this common misperception of peer hookup activity to media and pop culture portrayals of casual sexual encounters. Television and movies project distorted depictions of casual sex because they also commonly portray people who have just hooked up as emotionally satisfied and physically pleasured while simultaneously emotionally detached, which is not always the case. According to a 2004 peer-reviewed study published in the &quot;Journal of Marriage and Family&quot; found that women who have more than one premarital sexual relationship have a higher likelihood in the long run of disruptions if ever married, with this effect being the &quot;strongest for women who have multiple premarital coresidential unions&quot;. Kahn and London (1991) found that premarital sex and divorce are positively correlated.

=== Gender differences ===
== Legal and religious issues==
Attitudes to casual sex range from conservative and religious views, the extreme of which may result in imprisonment or even capital punishment for sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage, to liberal (libertarian or libertine) views, the extreme of which is free love.

=== Legal ===
The legality of adultery and prostitution varies around the world. In some countries there are laws which prohibit or restrict casual sex.

In some Muslim-majority countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Yemen, any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal.

=== Religious views ===

Many religions disapprove of sex outside marriage (see religion and sexuality), and the consequences range from very serious to none. Also, marriage is defined in quite different ways in different cultures, for example, with &quot;short-term marriage&quot; (see Nikah mut&#x27;ah).

Although some religious views look upon casual sex negatively, individual views on casual sex vary based on personal traits such as autonomy. Religious people and non-religious people mostly have similar feelings when it comes to having casual sex, with a bigger difference in attitude taking place between men and women.

== Commercial sites ==
Many specialist online dating services or other websites, known as &quot;adult personals&quot; or &quot;adult matching&quot; sites, cater to people looking for a purely sexual relationship without emotional attachments. These can provide a relatively anonymous forum where people who are geographically close but in totally separate work and social circles can make contact.

Tinder is a free smartphone dating app that boasts over 10 million daily users, making it the most popular dating app for iOS and Android. In this app, users can either swipe right (which indicates interest) or swipe left (which indicates disinterest) on other users in hopes of matching each other. If both users swipe right on one another, they are a match, and messaging can be initiated between parties. This app is used for a variety of reasons, one of which is casual hookups. Men are more likely than women to use Tinder to seek out casual sexual encounters. This is attributed to men, in comparison to women, placing sexual pleasure at a higher level of importance and using social networking sites to fulfill this need. However, overall, more users are motivated to use it to find romance rather than sex. Despite this, there is a social concern as some believe that the app encourages hookups between users.

<text>Rear Admiral Kemp Tolley (29 April 1908 – 28 October 2000) was an officer in the U.S. Navy and is the author of three books and numerous articles on the history of U.S. Navy activities in the Pacific, China, and the Soviet Union.

==Early life==

Admiral Tolley was born in Manila in, while his father, Lieutenant Colonel Oscar Kemp Tolley, was serving there in the U.S. Army, Kemp Tolley was a 1929 graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he was a member of Phi Alpha Theta.

==Early career==

During the 1930s, Tolley served aboard battleships, cruisers and a submarine tender. He also served on the exotic China station, becoming executive officer of the river gunboat USS &quot;Tutuila&quot; on the upper Yangtze River.

Tolley had a natural aptitude for languages and was fluent in Russian, German, French and Spanish.

==World War II==

Tolley, then a lieutenant, left Hankou, China on 27 November 1941 aboard . The gunboat sailed down the Yangtze River to Shanghai, where Tolley boarded , bound for Manila, Philippines.

On 5 December 1941 Tolley was given command of the sailing schooner &quot;Lanikai&quot;, which had been acquired by the Navy from a private owner, and given orders to sail in waters off the Philippines and report any sightings of Japanese warships. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor before Tolley could embark on this mission and the &quot;Lanikai&quot; was assigned to the Inshore Patrol.

&quot;Lanikai&quot; was detached on 26 December 1941 and ordered to attempt to escape to friendly waters. This was the start of a two-month odyssey during which &quot;Lanikai&quot; sailed from Manila in the Philippine Islands, to Surabaya on Java in the then Netherlands East Indies. &quot;Lanikai&quot; participated briefly in the doomed defense of Java and was strafed by Japanese aircraft on at least one occasion. Just prior to the fall of Java, Tolley took &quot;Lanikai&quot; to Tjilatjap on the south coast of Java where she evacuated allied stragglers. &quot;Lanikai&quot; departed Java 26 February 1942 just prior to the Dutch surrender and arrived at Fremantle, Australia on 18 March 1942. After suitable recovery and refitting Lanikai was engaged in patrol work along the northern coast of Western Australia until April 27, 1942.

In August 1942, the &quot;Lanikai&quot; was turned over to the Royal Australian Navy. Tolley was then reassigned as an assistant naval attaché in the Soviet Union. There, he met Vlada Gritzenko, whom he married in 1943. He served in this assignment until 1944 and was promoted to lieutenant commander and commander.

Late in 1944, Tolley returned to the Pacific when he was assigned as the navigator of the battleship USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; where he participated in combat action at Leyte Gulf and off Luzon during the liberation of the Philippines. He was also aboard &quot;North Carolina&quot; during the invasion of Iwo Jima and was wounded by shell fragments at Okinawa Gunto.

For his service during the war, Tolley received the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service, the Purple Heart for being wounded in action and seven battle stars.

==Post War Career==
After the war, he became an intelligence officer on the Naval Operations staff and commanded the attack cargo ship USS &quot;Vermilion&quot; (AKA-107) from June 1947 to September 1948.

From 1949 to 1952, he was the director of the intelligence division at the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, where his unorthodox teaching methods were frowned upon by his superiors although his classes were very popular with his students.

Other tours included operations officer on the staff of Commander Amphibious Group Two and command of Amphibious Squadron Five, during which time he was tasked with forming an evacuation plan for Taiwan. In 1956, he was designated commander of fleet activities at the Yokosuka, Japan.

==Later life==

Tolley retired from the Navy in 1959, and was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list in recognition of his being decorated for combat service. He then returned to his boyhood home in historic Corbett Village, Monkton, Maryland.

In retirement, he wrote more than 100 articles and three books, &quot;Yangtze Patrol,&quot; &quot;Cruise of the Lanikai&quot; and &quot;Caviar and Commissars.&quot;

In 1992, he was inducted into the Defense Attache Hall of Fame in Washington.

In 1993, he was honored at the White House Rose Garden by President Bill Clinton and later by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin.

Tolley died at his home in Corbett, Maryland on October 28, 2000 at the age of 92.

A bronze bust of Admiral Tolley was erected at the United States Naval Academy in his honor.

<text>Stress and duress is a term which has been used by the United States to describe interrogation techniques authorized for use by the United States Armed Forces upon detainees who are determined to be a threat to the United States during the War on Terrorism. These techniques are claimed to cause &quot;inhuman and degrading treatment&quot; but which the George W. Bush administration claims do not cause &quot;suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture&quot;.

== Status of prisoners under the Geneva Conventions ==
Prisoners of war are covered by the Third Geneva Convention (GCIII) until and unless &quot;&quot;their status has been determined by a competent tribunal&quot; (GCIII Art 5) to be that of civilians not affiliated with the armed forces or unlawful combatants, in which case they are covered by Fourth Geneva Convention (GCIV) unless they are &quot;&quot;[n]ationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention [and therefore] not protected by it. Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are.&quot;(GCIV Art 4. paragraph 2). But even if they are covered by GCIV, the U.S. can waver a detainee&#x27;s GCIV rights by invoking GCIV Article 5. &quot;Where, in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention as would, if exercised in the favour of such individual person, be prejudicial to the security of such State.&quot;&quot; But &quot;[i]n each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention. They shall also be granted the full rights and privileges of a protected person under the present Convention at the earliest date consistent with the security of the State or Occupying Power, as the case may be.&quot; (GCIV Art5)

The status of prisoners held in Iraq may vary depending on whether they are held in an internal or an international conflict.
== Sensory deprivation techniques comprised torture ==

Although not binding upon non-participating member states of the Council of Europe, this ruling is a useful indicator of international judicial views on the &quot;stress and duress&quot; methods authorised for use by the US administration.

In 1978 in the European Court of Human Rights(ECHR) trial &quot;Ireland v. the United Kingdom&quot; the judges court published the following in their judgement:
:&quot;These methods, sometimes termed &quot;disorientation&quot; or &quot;sensory deprivation&quot; techniques, were not used in any cases other than the fourteen so indicated above. It emerges from the Commission&#x27;s establishment of the facts that the techniques consisted of ...wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; deprivation of food and drink.&quot;

The Court ruled that the five techniques used together and combined with other abuses of the met the European definition of torture under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court found that the five techniques, combined together, consisted of torture and inhuman treatment, hence fell under the Article 3 (art. 3), the practice of &quot;inhuman and degrading treatment&quot;., i.e.
::&quot;147. In its report, the Commission expressed the opinion...(iv) unanimously, that the combined use of the five techniques in the cases before it constituted a practice of inhuman treatment and of torture in breach of Article 3 (art. 3); (v) unanimously, that violations of Article 3 (art. 3) occurred by inhuman, and in two cases degrading, treatment&quot;

<text>The Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18, is a concerto for piano and orchestra composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff between June 1900 and April 1901. The piece established his fame as a concerto composer and is one of his most enduringly popular pieces.

After the disastrous 1897 premiere of his First Symphony, Rachmaninoff suffered a psychological breakdown and depression that prevented composition for three years. In 1899, he was supposed to perform the Second Piano Concerto in London, which he had not composed yet, and instead made a successful conducting debut. The success led to an invitation to return next year with his First Piano Concerto; however, he promised to reappear with a newer and better one. After an unsuccessful meeting with Leo Tolstoy meant to revoke his writer&#x27;s block, relatives decided to introduce Rachmaninoff to the neurologist Nikolai Dahl, whom he visited daily from January to April 1900. Rachmaninoff dedicated the concerto to Dahl for successfully treating him by restoring his health and confidence in composition.

From the summer to the autumn of 1900, he worked on the second and third movements of the concerto, with the first movement causing him difficulties. Both movements of the unfinished concerto were first performed with him as soloist and his cousin Alexander Siloti conducting on . The first movement was finished in 1901, and the complete work had an astoundingly successful premiere on , again with the same duo. Gutheil published the concerto the same year.

==History==
===Background===
Sergei Rachmaninoff had been working on his First Symphony from January to September 1895. In 1896, after a long hiatus, the music publisher and philanthropist Mitrofan Belyayev agreed to include it at one of his Saint Petersburg Russian Symphony Concerts. However, there were setbacks: complaints were raised about the symphony by his teacher Sergei Taneyev upon receiving its score, which elicited revisions by Rachmaninoff, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov expressed dissatisfaction during rehearsal. Eventually, the symphony was scheduled to be premiered in March 1897. Before the due date, he was nervous but optimistic due to his prior successes, which included winning the Moscow Conservatory Great Gold Medal and earning the praise of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The premiere, however, was a disaster; Rachmaninoff listened to the cacophonous performance backstage to avoid getting humiliated by the audience and eventually left the hall when the piece finished. The symphony was brutally panned by critics, and apart from issues with the piece, the poor performance of the possibly drunk conductor, Alexander Glazunov, was also to blame. César Cui wrote:

If there were a conservatoire in Hell, if one of its talented students were instructed to write a programme symphony on &quot;The Seven Plagues of Egypt&quot;, and if he were to compose a symphony like Mr Rachmaninoff&#x27;s, then he would have fulfilled his task brilliantly and delighted the inmates of Hell.

Rachmaninoff initially remained aloof to the failure of his symphony, but upon reflection, suffered a psychological breakdown that stopped his compositional output for three years. He adopted a lifestyle of heavy drinking to forget about his problems. Depression consumed him, and although he rarely composed, he still engaged in performance, accepting a conducting position by the Russian entrepreneur Savva Mamontov at the Moscow Private Russian Opera from 1897 to 1898. It provided income for the cash-strapped Rachmaninoff; he eventually left as it didn&#x27;t allow time for other activities and due to the incompetence of the theater, which turned piano lessons into his main source of income.

At the end of 1898, Rachmaninoff was invited to perform in London in April 1899, where he was expected to play his Second Piano Concerto. However, he wrote to the London Philharmonic Society that he couldn&#x27;t finish a second concerto due to illness. The society requested he play his First Piano Concerto, but he declined, dismissing it as a student piece. Instead, he offered to conduct one of his orchestral pieces, to which the society agreed, provided he also performed at the piano. He made a successful conducting debut, performing &quot;The Rock&quot; and playing piano pieces such as his popular Prelude in C-sharp minor. The society secretary, Francesco Berger invited him to return next year with a performance of the First Concerto. However, he promised to return with a newer and better one, although he did not perform it there until 1908. Alexander Goldenweiser, a peer from the same conservatory, wanted to play his new concerto at a Belyayev concert in Saint Petersburg, thinking its consummation was inevitable. Rachmaninoff, who had thoughts of composing it three years earlier, sent a letter to him stating that nothing had been penned so far.

For the rest of the summer and autumn of 1899, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s unproductiveness worsened his depression. A friend of the Satins (relatives of Rachmaninoff), in an attempt to revoke the depressed composer&#x27;s writer&#x27;s block, suggested he visit Leo Tolstoy. However, his visit to the querulous author only increased his despondency, and he became so self-critical that he was rendered unable to compose. The Satins, anxious about his well-being, persuaded him to visit Nikolai Dahl, a neurologist who specialized in hypnosis, with whom they had a good experience. Desperate, he agreed without hesitation. From January to April 1900, he visited him daily free of charge. Dahl restored Rachmaninoff&#x27;s health and his confidence to compose. Himself a musician, Dahl engaged in lengthy conversations surrounding music with Rachmaninoff, and would repeat a triptych formula while the composer was half-asleep: &quot;You will begin to write your concerto ... You will work with great facility ... The concerto will be of an excellent quality&quot;. Even though the results were not readily evident, they were still successful.

===Composition and premiere===

In June 1900, after receiving an invitation to perform &quot;Mefistofele&quot; in La Scala, Feodor Chaliapin invited Rachmaninoff to live with him in Italy, where he sought his advice while studying the opera. During his stay, Rachmaninoff composed the love duet of his opera &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; and also began working on the second and third movements of his Second Piano Concerto. With newfound enthusiasm for composition, he resumed working on them after returning to Russia, which for the rest of the summer and the autumn were being finished &quot;quickly and easily&quot;, although the first movement caused him difficulties. He told his biographer Oscar von Riesemann that &quot;the material grew in bulk, and new musical ideas began to stir within me—far more than I needed for my concerto&quot;. 

The two finished movements were to be performed in the Moscow Nobility Hall on at a concert arranged for the benefit of the Ladies&#x27; Charity Prison Committee. On the eve of the concert, Rachmaninoff caught a cold, prompting his friends and relatives to stuff him with remedies, filling him with an excess of mulled wine; he didn&#x27;t want to admit his desire to cancel the performance. With him as soloist with an orchestra after an eight-year hiatus and his cousin Alexander Siloti making his conducting debut, it was an anxious event, but the concert was a great success, easing the worries of his close ones. Ivan Lipaev wrote: &quot;it&#x27;s been long since the walls of the Nobility Hall reverberated with such enthusiastic, storming applause as on that evening ... This work contains much poetry, beauty, warmth, rich orchestration, healthy and buoyant creative power. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s talent is evident throughout.&quot; The German company Gutheil published the concerto as opus number 18 the following year.

Before continuing composition, Rachmaninoff received financial aid from Siloti to tide him over for the next three years, securing his ability to compose without worrying about rent. By April 1901, while staying with Goldenweiser, he finished the first movement of the concerto and subsequently premiered the full work at a Moscow Philharmonic Society concert on , again with him at the piano and Siloti conducting. Five days before the premiere, however, Rachmaninoff received a letter from Nikita Morozov (his Conservatory colleague) pestering him regarding the structure of the concerto after receiving its score, commenting that the first subject seemed like an introduction to the second one. Frantic, he replied, writing that he concurred with his opinion and was pondering over the first movement. Regardless, it was an astounding success, and Rachmaninoff enjoyed wild acclaim. Even Cui, who previously scolded his First Symphony, displayed exuberance over the work in a letter from 1903. The piece established Rachmaninoff&#x27;s fame as a concerto composer and is one of his most enduringly popular pieces. He dedicated it to Dahl for his treatment.

===Subsequent performances===
The popularity of the Second Piano Concerto grew rapidly, developing global fame after its subsequent performances. Its international progress started with a performance in Germany, where Siloti played it with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under Arthur Nikisch&#x27;s baton in January 1902. In March, the same duo had a tremendously successful performance in Saint Petersburg; two days preceding this, the Rachmaninoff-Siloti duo performed back in Moscow, with the former conducting and the latter as soloist. May of the same year saw a performance at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in London, the soloist being Wassily Sapellnikoff with the Philharmonic Society and Frederic Cowen conducting; London would wait until 1908 for Rachmaninoff to perform it there. &quot;One was quickly persuaded of its genuine excellence and originality&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of the concerto following the performance. England, however, had already heard the work twice prior to the London premiere, with performances by Siloti in Birmingham and Manchester. Rachmaninoff—enhanced by success from repossessing the ability to compose again, coupled with no more financial worries—repaid the loan from Siloti within one year of receiving the last installment.

After marrying his first cousin Natalia Satina, the newly-wed Rachmaninoff received an invitation to play his concerto with the Vienna Philharmonic under the direction of Vasily Safonov in December. Although the engagement guaranteed him a hefty fee, he was anxious that accepting it would show ingratitude towards Siloti. However, after seeking his help, Taneyev reassured Rachmaninoff that this did not offend Siloti. That was followed by concerts in both Vienna and Prague the following spring in 1903 under the same engagement. In late 1904, Rachmaninoff won the Glinka Awards, cash prizes established in Belyayev&#x27;s will, receiving 500 rubles for his concerto. Throughout his life, Rachmaninoff soloed the concerto a total of 143 times.

===Early reception===
After he fulfilled his 1908 London concert engagement at the Queen&#x27;s Hall under Serge Koussevitzky, a flattering review by &quot;The Times&quot; emerged: &quot;The direct expression of the work, the extraordinary precision and exactitude of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s playing, and even the strict economy of movement of arms and hands which he exercises, all contributed to the impression of completeness of performance.&quot;
His debut with an American orchestra occurred on 8 November 1909, performing the concerto at the Philadelphia Academy of Music with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Max Fiedler&#x27;s baton, including repeat performances in Baltimore and New York City. Critics since the first performance were chiefly dismissive, echoing Philip Hale&#x27;s program notes for the debut stating that &quot;The concerto is of uneven worth. The first movement is labored and has little marked character. It might have been written by any German, technically well-trained, who was acquainted with the music of Tchaikovsky&quot;. Richard Aldrich, who was a music critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, murmured about the overperformance of the work in proportion to its worth, but complimented Rachmaninoff&#x27;s playing, stating that, with the assistance of the orchestra, &quot;he made it sound more interesting than it ever has before here&quot;. His last concert during the American tour was on 27 January 1910, performing the &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; and his concerto under Modest Altschuler with his Russian Symphony Society, who farewelled the homesick Rachmaninoff with appraisal of his &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; but dismissal of the concerto as &quot;not in any way comparable to Rachmaninoff&#x27;s third concerto&quot;. Rachmaninoff played the concerto eight times during the tour. Despite the concerto&#x27;s popularity, its critical reception has often remained poor.

Following the 1917 October Revolution, Rachmaninoff and his family escaped Russia, never to return, seeing the US as a haven for remedying his financial situation; they arrived there one day before Armistice Day, following their temporary stay in Scandinavia. Reginald De Koven praised a Rachmaninoff concerto performance under Walter Damrosch, writing that he rarely saw a New York audience &quot;more moved, excited and wrought up&quot;. A 1927 &quot;Liverpool Post&quot; article called the concerto a &quot;somewhat catchpenny work though it had plenty of rather cheap glitter&quot;. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s last performance of the Piano Concerto No. 2 was on 18 June 1942 with Vladimir Bakaleinikov leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. Reviewing the performance in &quot;Los Angeles Evening Citizen News&quot;, Richard D. Saunders opined that the work is of a &quot;songful quality, imbued with haunting melodies all tinged with sombre pathos and expressed with the graceful refinement characteristic of the composer&quot;.

===Modern reception and legacy===
No other concerto by Rachmaninoff was as popular with audiences and pianists alike as his Second Concerto; the musicologist Glen Carruthers attributes this popularity with &quot;memorable melodies [which] appear in each movement&quot;. Rachmaninoff&#x27;s biographer Geoffrey Norris characterized the concerto as &quot;notable for its conciseness and for its lyrical themes, which are just sufficiently contrasted to ensure that they are not spoilt either by overabundance or overexposure.&quot; Stephen Hough on an article with &quot;The Guardian&quot; posits that the composition is &quot;his most popular, most often performed and, arguably, the most perfect structurally. It sounds as if it wrote itself, so naturally does the music flow&quot;. Another article by John Ezard and David Ward calls it one of the &quot;most often performed concertos in the repertoire. Its emergence – in each year so far of the new century – as the British classical listening public&#x27;s favourite tune indicates Rachmaninov&#x27;s position as perhaps the most popular mainstream composer of the last 70 years.&quot; In both 2023 and 2024, the piece was voted number one in the Classic FM annual &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; poll, and has consistently ranked in the top three.

Numerous films—such as William Dieterle&#x27;s &quot;September Affair&quot; (1950), Charles Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (1954), and Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; (1955)—borrow themes from the concerto. David Lean&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945) utilizes the music widely in its soundtrack, and Frank Borzage&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Always Loved You&quot; (1946) features it heavily; this has further popularized the work. Steve Pemberton&#x27;s &quot;Inside No. 9&quot; heavily utilized its soundtrack in the episode &quot;A Quiet Night In&quot;, with almost the entire episode being devoid of speech, and the audio almost entirely following the concertos soundtrack. The concerto has also inspired numerous songs, and is frequently used in figure skating programmes.

==Structure==
The piece is written in three-movement concerto form:
===I. Moderato===

The opening movement begins with a series of chromatic bell-like tollings on the piano that build tension, eventually climaxing in the introduction of the main theme by the violins, violas, and first clarinet. The piano starts to play very low notes during the theme introduced by the strings and clarinet.

In this first section, while the melody is stated by the orchestra, the piano takes on the role of accompaniment, consisting of rapid oscillating arpeggios between both hands which contribute to the fullness and texture of the section&#x27;s sound. The theme soon goes into a slightly lower register, where it is carried on by the cello section, and then is joined by the violins and violas, soaring to a climactic C note. After the statement of the long first theme, a quick and virtuosic &quot;&quot;piu mosso&quot; pianistic figuration transition leads into a short series of authentic cadences, accompanied by both a crescendo and an accelerando; this then progresses into the gentle, lyrical second theme in E major, the relative key. The second theme is first stated by the solo piano, with light accompaniment coming from the upper wind instruments. A transition which follows the chromatic scale eventually leads to the final reinstatement of the second theme, this time with the full orchestra at a piano dynamic. The exposition ends with an agitated closing section with scaling arpeggios on the E major scale in both hands.

The agitated and unstable development borrows motifs from both themes, changing keys very often and giving the melody to different instruments while a new musical idea is slowly formed. The sound here, while focused on a particular tonality, has ideas of chromaticism. Two sequences of pianistic figurations lead to a placid, orchestral reinstatement of the first theme in the dominant 7th key of G. The development furthers with motifs from the previous themes, climaxing towards a B major &quot;più vivo&quot;&quot; section. A triplet arpeggio section leads into the accelerando section, with the accompanying piano playing chords in both hands, and the string section providing the melody reminiscent of the second theme. The piece reaches a climax with the piano playing dissonant fortississimo () chords, and with the horns and trumpets providing the syncopated melody.

While the orchestra restates the first theme, the piano, that on the other occasion had an accompaniment role, now plays the march-like theme that had been halfly presented in the development, thus making a considerable readjustment in the exposition, as in the main theme, the arpeggios in the piano serve as an accompaniment. This is followed by a piano-solo which continues the first theme and leads into a descending chromatic passage to a pianississimo A major chord. Then the second theme is heard played with a horn solo. The entrance of the piano reverts the key back into C minor, with triplet passages played over a mysterious theme played by the orchestra. Briefly, the piece transitions to a C major glissando in the piano, and is placid until drawn into the coda based on the first subject, marked &quot;Meno mosso&quot;, in which the movement ends in a C minor &quot;fortissimo&quot;, with the same authentic cadence as those that followed the first statement of the first theme in the exposition.

===II. Adagio sostenuto===
The second movement opens with a series of slow chords in the strings which modulate from the C minor of the previous movement to the E major of this movement.

At the beginning of the A section, the piano enters, playing a simple arpeggiated figure. This opening piano figure was composed in 1891 as the opening of the Romance from Two Pieces For Six Hands. The main theme is initially introduced by the flute, before being developed by an extensive clarinet solo. The motif is passed between the piano and then the strings.

Then the B section is heard. It builds up to a short climax centered on the piano, which leads to a cadenza for the piano.

The original theme is repeated with various inversions of chords and lower arpeggios on the piano. The orchestra mainly plays very legato and sweet, however the flutes play staccato chords for most of the ending. After a climactic phrase with piano and strings together, the music starts to die away losing more instruments and focusing more on the piano over time, slowly descending to a finish with just the soloist in E major.

===III. Allegro scherzando===
The last movement opens with a short orchestral introduction that modulates from E major (the key of the previous movement) to C minor, before a piano solo leads to the statement of the agitated first theme.

After the original fast tempo and musical drama ends, a short transition from the piano solo leads to the oboe and violas introducing a second lyrical theme in B major. This theme maintains the motif of the first movement&#x27;s second theme. The exposition ends with a suspenseful closing section in B major.

After that an extended and energetic development section is heard. The development is based on the first theme of the exposition. It maintains a very improvisational quality, as instruments take turns playing the stormy motifs.

In the recapitulation, the first theme is truncated to only 8 bars on the tutti, because it was widely used in the development section. After the transition, the recapitulation&#x27;s 2nd theme appears, this time in D major, half above the tonic. However, after the ominous closing section ends it then builds up into a triumphant climax in C major from the beginning of the coda. The movement ends very triumphantly in the tonic major with the same four-note rhythm ending the Third Concerto in D minor.

==Transcriptions and derivative works==

In 1901, Gutheil published the concerto along with the composer&#x27;s two piano arrangement. Austrian violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler transcribed the second movement for violin and piano in 1940, named &quot;Preghiera&quot; (Prayer). In 1946, Percy Grainger made a concert transcription of the third movement for piano solo. The Classical Jazz Quartet&#x27;s 2006 arrangement uses thematic sections derived from each movement as grounds for jazz improvisation.

Two songs recorded by Frank Sinatra have roots in the concerto: &quot;I Think of You&quot;, from the second theme of the first movement, and &quot;Full Moon and Empty Arms&quot;, from the second theme of the third movement. Eric Carmen&#x27;s 1975 ballad &quot;All by Myself&quot; is based on the second movement.

<text>Catanzaro (; ; ), also known as the &quot;City of the two Seas&quot; (), is an Italian city of 86,183 inhabitants (2020), the capital of the Calabria region and of its province and the second most populated comune of the region, behind Reggio Calabria.

The archbishop&#x27;s seat was the capital of the province of Calabria Ultra for over 200 years. It houses the &quot;Magna Græcia University&quot;, the second-largest university in Calabria.

Catanzaro is an urban centre, with much activity, including some coastal towns, such as Sellia Marina and Soverato, and the municipalities of Silas, with a total of 156,196 inhabitants. Catanzaro is being consolidated to form a greater metropolitan area, by the Region of Calabria, and in connection with the town of Lamezia Terme, comprising 10 municipalities. This will lead to the creation of an integrated area involving over 200,000 inhabitants.

During the summer months, the Ionian coast from Catanzaro to Soverato is an important tourist attraction, especially for the youth, and is in the presence of several important structures located in the coastal districts of the city and the towns of Copanello and Soverato.

Catanzaro is also known as the city of the three V&#x27;s, referring to the three distinct features of the city, namely Saint Vitalian, the patron saint; velvet, because the city has been an important silk centre since Byzantine times; and wind (vento in Italian), because of the strong breezes from the Ionian Sea and La Sila.

&quot;VVV&quot; was the symbol by which Catanzaro&#x27;s silk industry was known, identified for both its domestic and foreign markets, and iconic for the finest fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks, and brocades from the city.

== Geography ==
Catanzaro overlooks the Gulf of Squillace, in the Ionian Sea. The district of Catanzaro stretches from the sea to an elevation of . The historic center is approximately above sea level. The town dates back to the valley of Fiumarella (formerly known as River Zaro). The Bishopric, St. Tryphon (or San Rocco) and St. John (or castle) marks the city&#x27;s historical centre and is connected to the North Sila. Due to its particular geography, the municipality gets wet from the sea and is still subjected to a snowy winter. Catanzaro&#x27;s rivers include the mainstream of the Fiumarella (in local dialect Hjiumareddha), which joins with the river Musofalo, and the torrent Corach (formerly called Crotalo).

=== Climate ===
The climate of Catanzaro is typically Mediterranean, temperate, and characterized by a windy spring and autumn.

According to the 30-year average of 1961–90 reference, the average temperature of the coldest month, January, came to . The hottest month, August, is .

The climate, as mentioned, is marked by the presence of wind, even high intensity, especially during spring and autumn. The annual average intensity is about with peaks at . The months of April and May are characterized by strong winds and the &quot;scirocco libeccio&quot;.

The annual rainfall is around , distributed in 87 days on average, with a long summer and a maximum peak in the autumn and winter.

== History ==
Certain assumptions trace the origin of Catanzaro to an ancient Greek colony, already in place, which became the land of Scolacium, believed to have been built on the ruins of the ancient city of Trischines. Other sources identify Catanzaro&#x27;s development to have grown from various settlements scattered in the area of Catanzaro, Marina, Tiriolo (formerly Teure), Santa Maria di Catanzaro, and on the hill Trivonà (Trischines, along the valley of Corach which formed the old &quot;Land of Feaco&quot;). The mouth of the river, according to legend, created the ancient Ulysses Skilletion.

In the district of Germaneto along the valley of Corach, a Greek necropolis of the fifth century BC and an ancient Roman settlement were found. Archaeological discoveries show that the municipality was active since the Iron Age, flourishing with the populations of &quot;Vitulo&quot;, so-called because they worship the statue of the calf (), which the Greeks renamed (&quot;worshipers of the calf&quot;), and governed by the Italian king of the same name, brother of Dardanus and ancestor of the Trojans. Italy itself gets its name from this figure.

According to another legend, Catanzaro was named after two Byzantine generals Cattaro and Zaro who led the coastal city of Magna Graecia Skilletion or Skillakion, corresponding to the Roman Scolacium (near Catanzaro&#x27;s Marina), first on Zarapotamo (today Santa Maria di Catanzaro) and then later on Trivonà, a military fortress.

Catanzaro was always choice land due to its safe, high location, and the territory was under several groups&#x27; control, including the Saracens, Normans, Catalans and Venetians. The Saracens were the first to push the town&#x27;s development to its highest regions by the second half of the ninth century. Byzantine general Nikephoros Phokas was responsible for the naming of the &quot;Rock of Niceforo&quot;. Catanzaro&#x27;s development into a fortress town was established by General Flagizio, who began the construction of a citadel, which later assumed the name of Katantzárion. According to some assumptions, the name is inspired from the development of workshops for creating silk, what the Greeks call (, &quot;spinners of silk&quot;).

At the beginning of the tenth century (circa 903), the Byzantine city was occupied by the Saracens, who founded an emirate and took the Arab name of . An Arab presence is evidenced by findings at an eighth-century necropolis which had items with Arabic inscriptions.

Around the year 1050, Catanzaro rebelled against Saracen dominance and returned to a brief period of Byzantine control. In 1069, Catanzaro was the last city in Calabria, after many months of resistance, to fall under siege by the Normans of Robert Guiscard, who built the Norman castle, still in existence today. During this era, arts and crafts pioneered, and particularly the processing of silk, which was traded with other regions in Italy, other countries and Eastern Europe.

Between the 9th and the 11th century, Catanzaro was the first centre to introduce silk production to Italy. The silk of Catanzaro supplied almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair to Spanish, Venetian, Genoese and Dutch merchants. Catanzaro became the lace capital of Europe with a large silkworm breeding facility that produced all the laces and linens used in the Vatican. The city was world-famous for its fine fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and brocades.

While the cultivation of mulberry was moving first steps in Northern Italy, silk made in Calabria reached a peak of 50% of the whole Italian/European production. As the cultivation of mulberry was difficult in Northern and Continental Europe, merchants and operators used to purchase in Calabria raw materials in order to finish the products and resell them for a better price.
The Genoese silk artisans used fine Calabrian silk for the production of velvets.

In the 13th century, Emperor Frederick II made Catanzaro a direct possession of the crown. Later the city was the household feud of the Ruffo, Caraffa and Soriano families. The Normans elevated Catanzaro into a noble county, giving it to Peter Ruffo. The latter was lost in a struggle against Manfred of Sicily, but he later returned to the city, when Charles I of Anjou signed the peace of the War of the Vespers. For fourteen years, it was the royal domain of King Ladislaus of Naples, and in 1420 it was returned again to Nicholas Ruffo, who gave it as part of a dowry for his daughter Enrichetta who was married to Antonio Centelles. After a rebellion by the rural people, King Alfonso V of Aragon took control of the city. In 1460 there was a war with the partisans of Centelles. When peace returned, the city was granted new privileges which greatly promoted the development of its silk industry, for which its damasks were known throughout Europe. From this time forward, Catanzaro firmly established itself as an import center for its textile productions.

In the 15th century, Catanzaro was exporting both its silk cloth and its technical skills to neighbouring Sicily. By the middle of the century, silk spinning was taking place in Catanzaro, on a large scale.

In 1466, King Louis XI decided to develop a national silk industry in Lyon and called a large number of Italian workers, mainly from Calabria. The fame of the master silk weavers of Catanzaro spread throughout France and they were invited to Lyon in order to teach the techniques of weaving. In 1470, one of these weavers, known as Jean le Calabrais, invented the first prototype of a Jacquard-type loom. He introduced a new kind of machine which was able to work the yarns faster and more precisely. Over the years, improvements to the loom were ongoing.

In 1519 Emperor Charles V formally recognized the growth of the industry of Catanzaro by allowing the city to establish a consulate of the silk craft, charged with regulating and check in the various stages of a production that flourished throughout the sixteenth century. At the moment of the creation of its guild, the city declared that it had over 500 looms. By 1660, when the town had about 16,000 inhabitants, its silk industry kept 1,000 looms, and at least 5,000 people, busy. The silk textiles of Catanzaro were not only sold at the kingdom&#x27;s markets, they were also exported to Venice, France, Spain and England.

In 1528 Charles V gave authorization for Catanzaro to bear the imperial eagle attached to a coat of arms depicting the hilltops of the town.

On 23 December 1961, at the Fiumarella viaduct near Catanzaro, there was a serious rail accident, when a train derailed and fell about into the river below. Seventy-one passengers lost their lives on impact, and 28 others were injured to varying degrees.

In 1970 Catanzaro was designated to be the capital of Calabria.

<text>Street press is a type of publishing, between zines and magazines/newspapers in terms of distribution, content and audience. They are particularly prolific in Australia, especially music street press, although there are also some examples from Europe and North America.. 

Street press publications are usually available free to the reader. They are distributed by being made available to passers-by at locations such as restaurants, cafes, bars, clubs, live music venues, community centres and record stores.

To financially support themselves, street press publications usually take on more advertisements and sponsorship than other forms of media. Most street press publications are printed on low-quality newspaper stock to reduce costs. Some of the bigger publications print their covers and first few pages in colour, a rarer few use glossy paper for their cover. Virtually none of them print more than a couple of pages in colour. The size varies widely, some are printed in broadsheet format, some in tabloid format, and some in magazine-sized format. Non-standard paper sizes are also common, especially in the more obscure publications. 

Street press publications are usually also more professional in appearance and composition than zines, with established business structures and relatively mainstream content. Street press publications tend to have more mainstream, broad-appeal subject matter than zines so they can attract sponsors, and increase readership.

Street press publications can cover a wide variety of topics, many are focused upon specific subject matter of a target audience. Common topics include culture or entertainment topics, such independent or alternative music. Other niche publications might involve political satire, gay and/or lesbian issues, and film. 

Community newspapers, delivered to households, usually weekly, which consist primarily of localised news, do not fall into this category. Such newspapers often resemble conventional newspapers focused on local content. In addition, street press usually covers only a specific area of interest, whereas community newspapers might cover a wide variety of topics.

<text>Jeffrey Scot Suppan (; born January 2, 1975) is an American former professional baseball pitcher and current professional baseball coach who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Boston Red Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and San Diego Padres.

==Early life==
Suppan pitched at Crespi Carmelite High School in California&#x27;s San Fernando Valley. He pitched one no-hitter as a freshman and another as a senior against Harvard-Westlake School in the midst of a 42-inning scoreless streak. Suppan also played first base and hit .480 with a .950 slugging percentage as a senior. As a pitcher, he had a 0.73 WHIP, a 0.92 earned run average and a 9.07 strikeout-to-walk ratio. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named him their 1993 San Fernando Valley Player of the Year.

Suppan committed to play college baseball at UCLA over offers from USC, Nevada, Cal and Cal State Long Beach. He was selected by the Boston Red Sox with the 49th pick of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft and signed for $190,000.

==Professional career==
===Boston Red Sox===
He played with the Red Sox through the 1997 season. In his first three seasons, Suppan compiled a 9–6 record, his 1997 season marked his only season in Boston in which he made more than 10 starts. Although his record was 7–3 in 1997, his ERA was 5.69 in 22 starts.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
Suppan was selected in the 1997 MLB expansion draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks. In his lone season with Arizona, Suppan was 1–7 in 13 starts with a 6.68 ERA.

===Kansas City Royals===
Late in the 1998 season, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals, as a player to be named later, completing a trade that saw Jermaine Allensworth join the New York Mets and the Diamondbacks acquire Bernard Gilkey. Suppan was a mainstay for the Royals rotation, averaging 33 starts and 10 wins through his 4 seasons with the team. From 1999 to 2001, Suppan won 10 games in each season. In 2002, Suppan suffered his worst season as a Royal, going 9–16 in 33 starts.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
In 2003, he opened the season for the Pittsburgh Pirates after signing a one-year deal with them in January. Through 21 starts, Suppan was 10–7 with a 3.57 ERA for the Pirates.

===Second Stint with Boston===
Suppan was dealt at the trading deadline back to the Red Sox for their playoff stretch run, along with Anastacio Martinez and Brandon Lyon for prospects Freddy Sanchez and Mike Gonzalez. Suppan did not perform well in his return to Boston, going 3–4 with a 5.57 ERA and surrendering 12 home runs.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
The Cardinals signed Suppan as a free agent in 2004, and he embarked upon a career year, posting a 16–9 record and a 4.16 earned run average, with 110 strikeouts, 65 walks, and 192 hits allowed in 188 innings. Suppan helped lead the Cards to the 2004 World Series, where he started Game 3. His baserunning blunder in Game 3 was one of the defining moments of the Series.

In 2005, he improved on his previous year&#x27;s performance, going 16–10 with a 3.57 ERA. He started Game 4 of the National League Championship series against the Houston Astros, allowing one run over five innings but came away with a no-decision after the Astros took the lead later in the game.

Suppan has hit two career Major League home runs, both off Steve Trachsel of the New York Mets. His first was on September 10, 2005. The Cardinals won the game 4–2. He hit his second in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Championship Series. The Cardinals would win the game 5–0 to take a 2–1 lead in the series.

Suppan started Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS against the New York Mets. He did not factor in the decision, giving up only one run in seven innings, but the Cardinals won 3–1, earning him the National League Championship Series MVP. Suppan in the 2006 NLCS had a 0.60 ERA in 15 innings pitched.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
During the 2006 offseason, Suppan signed a four-year, $42 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.

Initial excitement in Milwaukee quickly waned as Suppan&#x27;s performance declined over time. From 2007 to 2009, his walk rate, home runs allowed, and ERA climbed while his strikeouts declined. Milwaukee fans began a practice of wearing paper bags over their heads and throwing soup cans on to the field during Suppan&#x27;s starts. Between 1995 and 2006, Suppan held a career ERA of 1.76 at Miller Park, where he was to pitch for the Brewers in 2007.

Suppan, along with teammates J. J. Hardy, Bill Hall, and Chris Capuano appeared in an episode of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; which aired on CBS on June 20, 2007. On June 7, 2008, Suppan was placed on the 15-day disabled list, his first DL stint since 1996. After being sent to the bullpen, Suppan&#x27;s run with Milwaukee ended after 15 appearances. On June 7, 2010, the Brewers released Suppan.

===St. Louis Cardinals (second stint)===
On June 14, 2010, Suppan signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. He became a free agent following the season.

===San Francisco Giants===
On January 25, 2011, the San Francisco Giants signed Suppan to a minor league deal. On March 29, the Giants released Suppan.
===Second Stint with Kansas City===
On April 4, 2011, the Kansas City Royals signed Suppan to a minor league deal. He spent the entire season with the Omaha Storm Chasers. He elected free agency after the season on November 2.

===San Diego Padres===

On February 8, 2012, Suppan signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres. After a rash of injuries to the Padres rotation, Suppan was called up to the majors. He made his first start on May 2, 2012. It was his first time making a start since the 2010 season. He was designated for assignment on June 1. Suppan opted for free agency over a minor league assignment with the Padres on June 5, 2012, according to the Padres&#x27; official website.

===Retirement===
Suppan announced his retirement as a player on January 2, 2014, his 39th birthday. The announcement was timed for 2 p.m. PST, to honor his mother, Kathleen Suppan, who died six years earlier on the same day and at the same time.

Suppan was the pitching coach for the Idaho Falls Chukars of the Pioneer League. The Chukars were the Rookie-Advanced affiliate of Suppan&#x27;s former team, the Kansas City Royals. In 2019, Suppan left the Chukars to become a roving minor league co-ordinator for the Royals organization.

==Pitching style==
As with many older pitchers, Suppan relied comparatively little on pitch speed to get outs. He was a finesse pitcher, using a variety of pitches with good movement to create weak contact for hitters. His expansive pitch repertoire included a four-seam fastball and sinker in the mid-upper 80s, a cut fastball in the low-mid 80s, a changeup around 80, a big curveball at 70 and a slider in the upper 70s.

==Restaurant==
Suppan, whose nickname is &quot;Soup&quot;, is also a restaurateur. His restaurant, Soup&#x27;s Grill, is jointly operated with his wife. It is located in Woodland Hills, California. Soup&#x27;s Grill closed in January 2016 to devote his time to being pitching coach for the Idaho Falls Chukars.

==Religion and activism==
Suppan is a devout Roman Catholic, appearing in the DVD &quot;Champions Of Faith&quot; and in &quot;Rosary Stars Praying the Gospel&quot;. He has spoken to the National Catholic Register about his faith.

He appeared in a political advertisement alongside Patricia Heaton, Jim Caviezel, Mike Sweeney, and Kurt Warner, among others, during the 2006 World Series. The advertisement aired in opposition to Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2006), which allows in Missouri any kind of embryonic stem cell research that is legal under federal law. The advertisement aired shortly after the airing of an earlier advertisement featuring actor Michael J. Fox The Fox advertisement had supported Amendment 2, as well as the campaign of United States Senate candidate Claire McCaskill. The Suppan advertisement did not explicitly mention the Senate race. The timing of both ads during a World Series that featured the St. Louis Cardinals was intended to draw the particular attention of Missouri voters.

<text>The fall of Singapore, also known as the Battle of Singapore, took place in the South–East Asian theatre of the Pacific War. The Empire of Japan captured the British stronghold of Singapore, with fighting lasting from 8 to 15 February 1942. Singapore was the foremost British military base and economic port in South–East Asia and had been of great importance to British interwar defence strategy. The capture of Singapore resulted in the largest British surrender in history.

Before the battle, Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashita had advanced with approximately 30,000 men down the Malayan Peninsula in the Malayan campaign. The British erroneously considered the jungle terrain impassable, leading to a swift Japanese advance as Allied defences were quickly outflanked. The British Lieutenant-General, Arthur Percival, commanded 85,000 Allied troops at Singapore, although many units were under-strength and most units lacked experience. The British outnumbered the Japanese but much of the water for the island was drawn from reservoirs on the mainland. The British destroyed the causeway, forcing the Japanese into an improvised crossing of the Johore Strait. Singapore was considered so important that Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered Percival to fight to the last man.

The Japanese attacked the weakest part of the island defences and established a beachhead on 8 February. Percival had expected a crossing in the north and failed to reinforce the defenders in time. Communication and leadership failures beset the Allies and there were few defensive positions or reserves near the beachhead. The Japanese advance continued and the Allies began to run out of supplies. By 15 February, about a million civilians in the city were crammed into the remaining area held by Allied forces, 1 percent of the island. Japanese aircraft continuously bombed the civilian water supply which was expected to fail within days. The Japanese were also almost at the end of their supplies and Yamashita wanted to avoid costly house-to-house fighting.

For the second time since the battle began, Yamashita demanded unconditional surrender and on the afternoon of 15 February, Percival capitulated. About 80,000 British, Indian, Australian and local troops became prisoners of war, joining the 50,000 taken in Malaya; many died of neglect, abuse or forced labour. Three days after the British surrender, the Japanese began the Sook Ching purge, killing thousands of civilians. The Japanese held Singapore until the end of the war. About 40,000, mostly conscripted, Indian soldiers joined the Indian National Army and fought with the Japanese in the Burma campaign. Churchill called it the worst disaster in British military history. The fall of Singapore, the sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;, and other defeats in 1941–1942 all severely undermined British prestige, which contributed to the end of British colonial rule in the region after the war.

==Background==
===Outbreak of war===

In the interwar years, Britain had established a naval base in Singapore after the Anglo-Japanese alliance had lapsed in 1923. As part of the Singapore strategy, the base formed a key part of British interwar defence planning for the region. Financial constraints had hampered construction efforts during the intervening period and shifting strategic circumstances had largely undermined the key premises behind the strategy by the time war had broken out in the Pacific. During 1940 and 1941, the Allies imposed a trade embargo on Japan in response to its campaigns in China and its occupation of French Indochina. The basic plan for taking Singapore was worked out in July 1940. Intelligence gained in late 1940–early 1941 did not alter that plan but confirmed it in the minds of Japanese decision makers. On 11 November 1940, the German raider &quot;Atlantis&quot; captured the British steamer &quot;Automedon&quot; in the Indian Ocean, carrying papers meant for Air Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, the British commander in the Far East. The papers included information about the weakness of the Singapore base. In December 1940, the Germans handed over copies of the papers to the Japanese. The Japanese had broken the British Army&#x27;s codes and in January 1941, the Second Department (the intelligence-gathering arm) of the Imperial Army interpreted and read a message from Singapore to London complaining in much detail about the weak state of &quot;Fortress Singapore&quot;, a message so frank in its admission of weakness that the Japanese at first suspected it was a British plant, believing that no officer would be so open in admitting weaknesses to his superiors. Only after cross-checking the message with the &quot;Automedon&quot; papers did the Japanese accept it to be genuine.

Japanese oil reserves were rapidly being depleted because of its military operations in China and by industrial consumption. In the latter half of 1941, the Japanese began preparations for war to seize vital resources if peaceful efforts to buy them failed. Planners determined a broad scheme of manoeuvres that incorporated simultaneous attacks on the territories of Britain, The Netherlands and the United States. This would see landings in Malaya and Hong Kong as part of a general move south to secure Singapore, connected to Malaya by the Johor–Singapore Causeway and then an invasion of the oil-rich area of Borneo and Java in the Dutch East Indies. Attacks would be made against the American naval fleet at Pearl Harbor as well as landings in the Philippines and attacks on Guam, Wake Island and the Gilbert Islands. Following these attacks, a period of consolidation was planned, after which the Japanese planners intended to build up the defences of the captured territory by establishing a strong perimeter from the India–Burma frontier through to Wake Island and traversing Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea and New Britain, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. This perimeter would be used to block Allied attempts to regain the lost territory and defeat their will to fight.

===Invasion of Malaya===
The Japanese 25th Army invaded Malaya from Indochina, moving into northern Malaya and Thailand by amphibious assault on 8 December 1941. This was virtually simultaneous with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which precipitated the United States&#x27; entry into the war. Thailand resisted landings on its territory for about 5 to 8 hours; it then signed a ceasefire and a Treaty of Friendship with Japan, later declaring war on the UK and the US. The Japanese then proceeded overland across the Thai–Malayan border to attack Malaya. At this time, the Japanese began bombing Singapore.

The 25th Army was resisted in northern Malaya by III Corps of the British Indian Army. Although the 25th Army was outnumbered by Commonwealth forces in Malaya and Singapore, they did not take the initiative with their forces while Japanese commanders concentrated theirs. The Japanese were superior in close air support, armour, co-ordination, tactics and experience. Conventional British military thinking was that the Japanese forces were inferior and characterised the Malayan jungles as &quot;impassable&quot;; the Japanese were repeatedly able to use this to their advantage to outflank hastily established defensive lines. Prior to the Battle of Singapore the most resistance was met at the Battle of Muar which involved the 8th Australian Division and the 45th Indian Brigade. The British troops left in the city of Singapore were basically garrison troops.

At the start of the campaign, the Commonwealth forces had only 164 first-line aircraft in Malaya and Singapore and the only fighter type was the sub-standard Brewster 339E Buffalo. The Buffaloes were operated by one Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and two Royal Air Force (RAF) squadrons. The aircraft were, according to historian Peter Dennis, &quot;not considered good enough for use in Europe&quot; and major shortcomings included a slow rate of climb and the fuel system, which required the pilot to hand-pump fuel if flying above . The Imperial Japanese Army Air Force was more numerous and better trained than the second-hand assortment of untrained pilots and inferior Commonwealth equipment remaining in Malaya, Borneo and Singapore. Japanese fighters were superior to the Commonwealth fighters, which helped the Japanese to gain air supremacy. Although outnumbered and outclassed, the Buffalos were able to provide some resistance, with RAAF pilots alone managing to shoot down at least 20 Japanese aircraft before the few survivors were withdrawn.
Force Z, consisting of the battleship , the battlecruiser and four destroyers, sailed north out of Singapore on 8 December to oppose expected Japanese landings along the coast of Malaya. Japanese land-based aircraft found and sank the two capital ships on 10 December, leaving the east coast of the Malayan Peninsula exposed and allowing the Japanese to continue their amphibious landings. Japanese forces quickly isolated, surrounded and forced the surrender of Indian units defending the coast. Despite their numerical inferiority, they advanced down the Malayan Peninsula, overwhelming the defences. The Japanese forces also used bicycle infantry and light tanks, allowing swift movement through the jungle. The Commonwealth having thought the terrain made them impractical, had no tanks and only a few armoured vehicles, which put them at a severe disadvantage.

Although more Commonwealth units—including some from the 8th Australian Division—joined the campaign, the Japanese prevented them from regrouping. The Japanese overran cities and advanced toward Singapore, which was an anchor for the operations of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), the first Allied joint command of the Second World War. Singapore controlled the main shipping channel between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. An ambush was sprung by the 2/30th Australian Battalion on the main road at the Gemenceh River near Gemas on 14 January, causing many Japanese casualties.

At Bakri, from 18 to 22 January, the Australian 2/19th and 2/29th battalions and the 45th Indian Brigade (Lieutenant Colonel Charles Anderson) repeatedly fought through Japanese positions before running out of ammunition near Parit Sulong. The survivors were forced to leave behind about 110 Australian and 40 Indian wounded, who were later beaten, tortured and murdered by Japanese troops during the Parit Sulong Massacre. Of over 3,000 men from these units only around 500 men escaped. For his leadership in the fighting withdrawal, Anderson was awarded the Victoria Cross. A determined counter-attack by the 5/11th Sikh Regiment (Lieutenant-Colonel John Parkin) in the area of Niyor, near Kluang, on 25 January and an ambush around the Nithsdale Estate by the 2/18th Australian Battalion on 26/27 January bought valuable time and permitted East Force, based on the 22nd Australian Brigade (Brigadier Harold Taylor), to withdraw from eastern Johor (formerly Johore). On 31 January, the last Commonwealth forces crossed the causeway linking Johor and Singapore and engineers blew it up.

==Prelude==
During the weeks preceding the invasion, Commonwealth forces suffered a number of both subdued and openly disruptive disagreements amongst its senior commanders, as well as pressure from Australian Prime Minister John Curtin. Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, commander of the garrison, had 85,000 soldiers—the equivalent, on paper at least, of just over four divisions. Of this figure, 15,000 men were employed in supply, administrative, or other non-combatant roles. The remaining force was a mix of front-line and second-line troops. There were 49 infantry battalions—21 Indian, 13 British, six Australian, four Indian States Forces assigned to airfield defence, three Straits Settlements Volunteer Force, and two Malayan. In addition, there were two British machine-gun battalions, one Australian, and a British reconnaissance battalion. The newly arrived 18th Infantry Division (Major-General Merton Beckwith-Smith)—was at full strength but lacked experience and training. The rest of the force was of mixed quality, condition, training, equipment and morale. Lionel Wigmore, the Australian official historian of the Malayan campaign, wrote

Percival gave Major-General Gordon Bennett&#x27;s two brigades from the 8th Australian Division responsibility for the western side of Singapore, including the prime invasion points in the northwest of the island. This was mostly mangrove swamp and jungle, broken by rivers and creeks. In the heart of the &quot;Western Area&quot; was RAF Tengah, Singapore&#x27;s largest airfield at the time. The Australian 22nd Brigade, under Brigadier Harold Taylor, was assigned a wide sector in the west, and the 27th Brigade, under Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, had responsibility for a zone just west of the Causeway. The infantry positions were reinforced by the recently arrived Australian 2/4th Machine-Gun Battalion. Also under Bennett&#x27;s command was the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade.

The III Indian Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir Lewis Heath) including the 11th Indian Infantry Division under Major-General Berthold Key with reinforcements from the 8th Indian Brigade, and the 18th Infantry Division—was assigned the north-eastern sector, known as the &quot;Northern Area&quot;. This included the naval base at Sembawang. The &quot;Southern Area&quot;, including the main urban areas in the south-east, was commanded by Major-General Frank Simmons. His forces consisted of elements of the 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade and the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force Brigade with the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade in reserve.
From 3 February, the Commonwealth forces were shelled by Japanese artillery, and air attacks on Singapore intensified over the next five days. The artillery and air bombardment strengthened, severely disrupting communications between Commonwealth units and their commanders and affecting preparations for the defence of the island. From aerial reconnaissance, scouts, infiltrators and observation from high ground across the straits (such as at Istana Bukit Serene and the Sultan of Johor&#x27;s palace), Japanese commander General Tomoyuki Yamashita and his staff gained excellent knowledge of the Commonwealth positions. Yamashita and his officers stationed themselves at Istana Bukit Serene and the Johor state secretariat building—the Sultan Ibrahim Building—to plan for the invasion of Singapore. Although his military advisors judged that Istana Bukit Serene was an easy target, Yamashita was confident that the British Army would not attack the palace because it belonged to the Sultan of Johor. Yamashita&#x27;s prediction was correct; despite being observed by Australian artillery, permission to engage the palace was denied by Gordon Bennett.
Most of Singapore&#x27;s BL 15-inch Mk I naval guns could be traversed north and were used to engage the Japanese. The guns—which included the Johore Battery, with three guns and one battery with two guns—were supplied mostly with armour-piercing shells (AP) for anti-shipping use and few high explosive (HE) shells. Percival incorrectly guessed that the Japanese would land forces on the north-east side of Singapore, ignoring advice that the north-west was a more likely direction of attack (where the Straits of Johor were the narrowest and a series of river mouths provided cover for the launching of water craft). This was encouraged by the deliberate movement of Japanese troops in this sector to deceive the British. Much of the equipment and resources of the garrison had been incorrectly allocated to the north east sector, where the most complete and freshest formation—the 18th Infantry Division—was deployed, while the depleted 8th Australian Division sector with two of its three brigades had no serious fixed defensive works or obstacles. To compound matters, Percival had ordered the Australians to defend forward so as to cover the waterway, yet this meant they were immediately fully committed to any fighting, limiting their flexibility, whilst also reducing their defensive depth. The two Australian brigades were subsequently allocated a very wide frontage of over and were separated by the Kranji River.

Yamashita had just over 30,000 men from three divisions: the Imperial Guards Division (Lieutenant-General Takuma Nishimura), the 5th Division (Lieutenant-General Takuro Matsui) and the Japanese 18th Division (Lieutenant-General Renya Mutaguchi). Also in support was a light tank brigade. In comparison, following the withdrawal, Percival had about 85,000 men at his disposal, although 15,000 were administrative personnel, while large numbers were semi-trained British, Indian and Australian reinforcements that had only recently arrived. Of those forces that had seen action during the previous fighting, the majority were under-strength and under-equipped.

In the days leading up to the Japanese attack, patrols from the Australian 22nd Brigade were sent across the Straits of Johor at night to gather intelligence. Three small patrols were sent on the evening of 6 February, one was spotted and withdrew after its leader was killed and their boat sunk and the other two managed to get ashore. Over the course of a day, they found large concentrations of troops, although they were unable to locate any landing craft. The Australians requested the shelling of these positions to disrupt the Japanese preparations but the patrol reports were later ignored by Malaya Command as being insignificant, based upon the belief that the real assault would come in the north-eastern sector, not the north-west.

==Battle==
===Japanese landings===

Blowing up the causeway had delayed the Japanese attack for over a week. Prior to the main assault, the Australians were subjected to an intense artillery bombardment. Over a period of 15 hours, starting at 23:00 on 8 February 1942, Yamashita&#x27;s heavy guns fired a bombardment of 88,000 shells (200 rounds per gun) along the straits, cutting telephone lines and isolating forward units. The British had the means to conduct counter-battery fire opposite the Australians that would have caused casualties and disruption among the Japanese assault troops. The bombardment of the Australians was not seen as a prelude to attack—Malaya Command believed that it would last several days and would later switch its focus to the north-east, despite its ferocity exceeding anything the Allies had experienced thus far in the campaign; no order was passed to the Commonwealth artillery units to bombard possible Japanese assembly areas.

Shortly before 20:30 on 8 February, the first wave of Japanese troops from the 5th Division and 18th Division began crossing the Johor Strait. The main weight of the Japanese force, about 13,000 men, from 16 assault battalions, with five in reserve, attacked the 22nd Australian Brigade. The assault was received by the 2/18th Battalion and the 2/20th Battalion. Each Japanese division had 150 barges and collapsible boats, sufficient for lifts of 4,000. During the first night 13,000 Japanese troops landed and were followed by another 10,000 after first light. The Australians numbered just 3,000 men and lacked any significant reserve.

As the landing craft closed on the Australian positions, machine gunners from the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion, interspersed amongst the rifle companies, opened fire. Spotlights had been placed on the beaches by a British unit to illuminate an invasion force on the water but many had been damaged by the bombardment and no order was made to turn the others on. The initial wave was concentrated against the positions occupied by the 2/18th and 2/20th Battalions, around the Buloh River, as well as one company from the 2/19th Battalion. Over the course of an hour, intense fighting took place on the right flank of the 2/19th Battalion, until its positions were overrun, the Japanese then advanced inland concealed by the darkness and the vegetation. The resistance put up by the company from the 2/19th pushed the follow-on waves of Japanese craft to land around the mouth of Murai River, which resulted in them creating a gap between the 2/19th and 2/18th battalions. From there the Japanese launched two concerted attacks against the 2/18th, which were met with massed fire before they overwhelmed the Australians by weight of numbers. Urgent requests for fire support were made and the 2/15th Field Regiment responded to these requests with over 4,800 rounds.

Fierce fighting raged throughout the evening but due to the terrain and the darkness, the Japanese were able to disperse into the undergrowth, surround and overwhelm pockets of Australian resistance or bypass them exploiting gaps in the thinly spread Commonwealth lines due to the many rivers and creeks in the area. By midnight, the two Japanese divisions fired star shell to indicate to their commander that they had secured their initial objectives and by 01:00 they were well established. Over the course of two hours, the three Australian battalions that had been engaged sought to regroup, moving back east from the coast towards the centre of the island, which was completed mainly in good order. The 2/20th managed to concentrate three of its four companies around the Namazie Estate, although one was left behind; the 2/18th was only able to concentrate half its strength at Ama Keng, while the 2/19th also moved back three companies, leaving a fourth to defend Tengah airfield. Further fighting followed in the early morning of 9 February and the Australians were pushed back further, with the 2/18th being pushed out of Ama Keng and the 2/20th being forced to pull back to Bulim, west of Bukit Panjong. Bypassed elements tried to break out and fall back to the Tengah airfield to rejoin their units and suffered many casualties. Bennett attempted to reinforce the 22nd Brigade by moving the 2/29th Battalion from the 27th Brigade area to Tengah but before it could be used to recapture Ama Keng, the Japanese launched another attack around the airfield and the 2/29th was forced onto the defensive. The initial fighting cost the Australians many casualties, with the 2/20th alone losing 334 men killed and 214 wounded.

===Air operations===

The air campaign for Singapore began during the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8 December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese aircraft, such as the Mitsubishi G3M2 &quot;Nell&quot; and the Mitsubishi G4M1 &quot;Betty&quot;, based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the northern airfields. For the rest of December there were false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base but no raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate that one British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his Vickers machine gun at any aircraft that passed. He could only say &quot;The bloody bastards will never think of looking for me in the open, and I want to see a bloody plane brought down&quot;. The next recorded raid on the city occurred on the night of 29/30 December, and nightly raids ensued for over a week, accompanied by daylight raids from 12 January 1942. As the Japanese army advanced towards Singapore Island, the day and night raids increased in frequency and intensity, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties, up to the time of the British surrender.

In December, 51 Hawker Hurricane Mk II fighters and 24 pilots were sent to Singapore, the nuclei of five squadrons. They arrived on 3 January 1942, by which stage the Buffalo squadrons had been overwhelmed. No. 232 Squadron RAF was formed and No. 488 Squadron RNZAF, a Buffalo squadron, had converted to Hurricanes; 232 Squadron became operational on 20 January and destroyed three Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscars&quot; that day, for the loss of three Hurricanes. Like the Buffalos the Hurricanes began to suffer severe losses in dogfights. From 27 to 30 January, another 48 Hurricanes arrived on the aircraft carrier . Operated by the four squadrons of No. 226 Group RAF, they flew from an airfield code-named P1, near Palembang, Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies, while a flight was maintained in Singapore. Many of the Hurricanes were destroyed on the ground by air raids. The lack of an effective air early warning system throughout the campaign meant that many Commonwealth aircraft were lost in this manner during Japanese attacks against airfields.
By the time of the invasion, only ten Hurricanes of 232 Squadron, based at RAF Kallang, remained to provide air cover for the Commonwealth forces on Singapore. The airfields at Tengah, Seletar and Sembawang were in range of Japanese artillery at Johor Bahru. RAF Kallang was the only operational airstrip left; the surviving squadrons and aircraft had withdrawn by January to reinforce the Dutch East Indies. On the morning of 9 February, dogfights took place over Sarimbun Beach and other western areas. In the first encounter, the last ten Hurricanes were scrambled from Kallang Airfield to intercept a Japanese formation of about 84 aircraft, flying from Johor to provide air cover for their invasion force. The Hurricanes shot down six Japanese aircraft and damaged 14 others for the loss of a Hurricane.

Air battles went on for the rest of the day and by nightfall it was clear that with the few aircraft Percival had left, Kallang could no longer be used as a base. With his assent, the remaining flyable Hurricanes were withdrawn to Sumatra. A squadron of Hurricane fighters took to the skies on 9 February but was then withdrawn to the Netherlands East Indies and after that no Commonwealth aircraft were seen again over Singapore; the Japanese had achieved air supremacy. That evening, three Fairmile B motor launches attacked and sank several Japanese landing craft in the Johor Strait around its western channel on the evening of 9 February. On the evening of 10 February, General Archibald Wavell, commander of ABDA, ordered the transfer of all remaining Commonwealth air force personnel to the Dutch East Indies. By this time, Kallang Airfield was, according to author Frank Owen, &quot;so pitted with bomb craters that it was no longer usable&quot;.

===Second day===
Believing that further landings would occur in the northeast, Percival did not reinforce the 22nd Brigade until the morning of 9 February, sending two half-strength battalions from the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade. The Indians reached Bennett around noon. Shortly afterwards Percival allocated the composite 6th/15th Indian Infantry Brigade to reinforce the Australians from their position around the Singapore racecourse. Throughout the day, the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade, still holding its position on the coast, began to feel pressure on its exposed flank and after discussions between Percival and Bennett, it was decided that they would have to retire eastwards to maintain the southern part of the Commonwealth line. Bennett decided to form a secondary defensive line, known as the &quot;Kranji-Jurong Switch Line&quot; facing west between the two rivers, with its centre around Bulim, east of Tengah Airfield—which subsequently came under Japanese control—and just north of Jurong.

To the north, the 27th Australian Brigade had not been engaged during the Japanese assaults on the first day. Possessing only the 2/26th and 2/30th, following the transfer of the 2/29th Battalion to the 22nd Brigade, Maxwell sought to reorganise his force to deal with the threat posed to the western flank. Late on 9 February, the Imperial Guards began assaulting the positions held by the 27th Brigade, concentrating on those held by the 2/26th Battalion. During the initial assault, the Japanese suffered severe casualties from Australian mortars and machine-guns and from burning oil which had been sluiced into the water following the demolition of several oil tanks by the Australians. Some of the Guards reached the shore and maintained a tenuous beachhead; at the height of the assault, it is reported that the Guards commander, Nishimura, requested permission to cancel the attack due to the many casualties his troops had suffered from the fire but Yamashita ordered them to press on.
Communication problems caused further cracks in the Commonwealth defence. Maxwell knew that the 22nd Brigade was under increasing pressure but was unable to contact Taylor and was wary of encirclement. As parties of Japanese troops began to infiltrate the brigade&#x27;s positions from the west, exploiting the gap formed by the Kranji River, the 2/26th Battalion was forced to withdraw to a position east of the Bukit Timah Road; this move precipitated a sympathetic move by the 2/30th away from the causeway. The authority for this withdrawal would later be the subject of debate, with Bennett stating that he had not given Maxwell authorisation to do so. The result was that the Allies lost control of the beaches adjoining the west side of the causeway, the high ground overlooking the causeway and the left flank of the 11th Indian Division was exposed. The Japanese were given a firm foothold to &quot;build up their force unopposed&quot;.

===Japanese breakthrough===
The opening at Kranji made it possible for Imperial Guards armoured units to land there unopposed, after which they were able to begin ferrying across their artillery and armour. After finding his left flank exposed by the withdrawal of the 27th Brigade, the commander of the 11th Indian Infantry Division, Key, dispatched the 8th Indian Infantry Brigade from reserve, to retake the high ground to the south of the Causeway. Throughout 10 February further fighting took place around along the Jurong Line, as orders were formulated to establish a secondary defensive line to the west of the Reformatory Road, with troops not then employed in the Jurong Line; misinterpretation of these orders resulted in Taylor, the commander of the 22nd Brigade, prematurely withdrawing his troops to the east, where they were joined by a 200-strong ad hoc battalion of Australian reinforcements, known as X Battalion. The Jurong Line eventually collapsed after the 12th Indian Brigade was withdrawn by its commander, Brigadier Archie Paris, to the road junction near Bukit Panjang, after he lost contact with the 27th Brigade on his right; the commander of the 44th Indian Brigade, Ballantine, commanding the extreme left of the line, also misinterpreted the orders in the same manner that Taylor had and withdrew. On the evening of 10 February, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, cabled Wavell

In the early afternoon of 10 February, on learning of the collapse of the Jurong Line, Wavell ordered Percival to launch a counter-attack to retake it. This order was passed on to Bennett, who allocated X Battalion. Percival made plans of his own for the counter-attack, detailing a three-phased operation that involved the majority of the 22nd Brigade, and he subsequently passed this on to Bennett, who began implementing the plan, but forgot to call X Battalion back. The battalion, consisting of poorly trained and equipped replacements, advanced to an assembly area near Bukit Timah. In the early hours of 11 February, the Japanese, who had concentrated significant forces around the Tengah airfield and on the Jurong Road, began further offensive operations: the 5th Division aimed its advance towards Bukit Panjang, while the 18th Division struck out towards Bukit Timah. They fell upon X Battalion, which had camped in its assembly area while waiting to launch its counter-attack, and two-thirds of the battalion was killed or wounded. After brushing aside elements of the 6th/15th Indian Brigade, the Japanese again began attacking the 22nd Australian Brigade around the Reformatory Road.

Later on 11 February, with Japanese supplies running low, Yamashita attempted to bluff Percival, calling on him to &quot;give up this meaningless and desperate resistance&quot;. The fighting strength of the 22nd Brigade—which had borne the brunt of the Japanese attacks—had been reduced to a few hundred men and the Japanese had captured the Bukit Timah area, including the main food and fuel depots of the garrison. Wavell told Percival that the garrison was to fight on to the end and that there should not be a general surrender in Singapore. With the vital water supply of the reservoirs in the centre of the island threatened, the 27th Australian Brigade was later ordered to recapture Bukit Panjang as a preliminary move in retaking Bukit Timah. The counter-attack was repulsed by the Imperial Guards and the 27th Australian Brigade was split in half on either side of the Bukit Timah Road with elements spread as far as the Pierce Reservoir.

The next day, as the situation worsened for the Commonwealth, they sought to consolidate their defences; during the night of 12/13 February, the order was given for a perimeter to be established around Singapore City at the eastern end of the island. This was achieved by moving the defending forces from the beaches along the northern shore and from around Changi, with the 18th Infantry Division being tasked to maintain control of the vital reservoirs and effecting a link up with Simmons&#x27; Southern Area forces. The withdrawing troops received harassing attacks all the way back. Elsewhere, the 22nd Brigade continued to hold a position west of the Holland Road until late in the evening when it was pulled back to Holland Village.

On 13 February, Japanese engineers repaired the road over the causeway and more tanks were pushed across. With the Commonwealth still losing ground, senior officers advised Percival to surrender in the interest of minimising civilian casualties. Percival refused but tried to get authority from Wavell for greater discretion as to when resistance might cease. The Japanese captured the water reservoirs that supplied the town but did not cut off the supply. That day, military police executed Captain Patrick Heenan for espionage. An Air Liaison Officer with the British Indian Army, Heenan had been recruited by Japanese military intelligence and had used a radio to assist them in attacking Commonwealth airfields in northern Malaya. He had been arrested on 10 December and court-martialled in January. Heenan was shot at Keppel Harbour, on the southern side of Singapore and his body was thrown into the sea.

The Australians occupied a perimeter of their own to the north-west around Tanglin Barracks, in which they maintained an all round defence as a precaution. To their right, the 18th Division, the 11th Indian Division and the 2nd Malaya Brigade held the perimeter from the edge of the Farrar Road east to Kallang, while to their left, the 44th Indian Brigade and the 1st Malaya Brigade held the perimeter from Buona Vista to Pasir Panjang. For the most part, there was limited fighting around the perimeter, except around Pasir Panjang Ridge, from Singapore Harbour, where the 1st Malaya Brigade—which consisted of a Malayan infantry battalion, two British infantry battalions and a force of Royal Engineers—fought a stubborn defensive action during the Battle of Pasir Panjang. The Japanese largely avoided attacking the Australian perimeter but in the northern area, the British 53rd Infantry Brigade was pushed back by a Japanese assault up the Thompson Road and had to fall back north of Braddell Road in the evening, joining the rest of the 18th Infantry Division in the line. They dug in and throughout the night fierce fighting raged on the northern front.

The following day, the remaining Commonwealth units fought on. Civilian casualties mounted as a million people crowded into the area still held by the Commonwealth and bombing and artillery-fire increased. The civilian authorities began to fear that the water supply would give out; Percival was advised that large amounts of water were being lost due to damaged pipes and that the water supply was on the verge of collapse.

===Alexandra Hospital massacre===
On 14 February 1942, the Japanese renewed their assault on the western part of the Southern Area&#x27;s defences near the area that the 1st Malayan Brigade had fought desperately to hold the previous day. At about 13:00, the Japanese broke through and advanced towards the Alexandra Barracks Hospital. A British lieutenant—acting as an envoy with a white flag—approached Japanese forces but was killed with a bayonet. After Japanese troops entered the hospital, they killed up to 50 soldiers, including some undergoing surgery. Doctors and nurses were also killed. The next day, about 200 male staff members and patients who had been assembled and bound the previous day, many of them walking wounded, were ordered to walk about to an industrial area. Those who fell on the way were bayoneted. The men were forced into a series of small, badly ventilated rooms where they were held overnight without water. Some died during the night as a result of their treatment. The remainder were bayoneted the following morning. Several survivors were identified after the war, some of whom had survived by pretending to be dead. One survivor, Private Arthur Haines from the Wiltshire Regiment, wrote a four-page account of the massacre that was sold by his daughter by private auction in 2008.

===Fall of Singapore===
Throughout the night of 14/15 February, the Japanese continued to press against the Commonwealth perimeter, and though the line largely held, the military supply situation was rapidly deteriorating. The water system was badly damaged and supply was uncertain, rations were running low, petrol for military vehicles was all but exhausted, and there was little ammunition left for the field artillery and anti-aircraft guns, which were unable to disrupt the Japanese air attacks causing many casualties in the city centre. Little work had been done to build air raid shelters, and looting and desertion by Commonwealth troops further added to the chaos in the area. At 09:30, Percival held a conference at Fort Canning with his senior commanders. He proposed two options: an immediate counter-attack to regain the reservoirs and the military food depots around Bukit Timah, or surrender. After a full and frank exchange of views, all present agreed that no counter-attack was possible, and Percival opted for surrender. Post-war analysis has shown that a counter-attack might have succeeded. The Japanese were at the limit of their supply line and their artillery units were also running out of ammunition.

A delegation was selected to go to the Japanese headquarters. It consisted of a senior staff officer, the colonial secretary and an interpreter. The three set off in a motor car bearing a Union Jack and a white flag of truce toward the enemy lines to discuss a cessation of hostilities. They returned with orders that Percival himself proceed with staff officers to the Ford Motor Factory, where Yamashita would lay down the terms of surrender. A further requirement was that the Japanese Rising Sun Flag be hoisted over the Cathay Building, the tallest building in Singapore. Percival formally surrendered shortly after 17:15. Earlier that day, Percival had issued orders to destroy all secret and technical equipment, ciphers, codes, secret documents and heavy guns.
Under the terms of the surrender, hostilities were to cease at 20:30 that evening, all military forces in Singapore were to surrender unconditionally, all Commonwealth forces would remain in position and disarm themselves within an hour, and the British were allowed to maintain a force of 1,000 armed men to prevent looting until relieved by the Japanese. Yamashita also accepted full responsibility for the lives of the civilians in the city. Following the surrender, Bennett caused controversy when he decided to escape. After receiving news of the surrender, Bennett handed command of the 8th Australian Division to the divisional artillery commander, Brigadier Cecil Callaghan and—along with some of his staff officers—commandeered a small boat.

Bennett&#x27;s party eventually made its way back to Australia while between 15,000 and 20,000 Australian soldiers were reportedly captured. Bennett blamed Percival and the Indian troops for the defeat but Callaghan reluctantly stated that Australian units had been affected, towards the end of the battle, by many desertions. The Kappe Report, compiled by Colonels J. H. Thyer and C. H. Kappe, concedes that at most only two-thirds of the Australian troops manned the final perimeter. Many British units were reported to have been similarly affected.

In analysing the campaign, Clifford Kinvig, a senior lecturer at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, blamed the commander of the 27th Infantry Brigade, Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, for his defeatist attitude and not properly defending the sector between the Causeway and the Kranji River. Elphick also claims that Australians made up the majority of stragglers. According to another source, Taylor cracked under the pressure. Thompson wrote that the 22nd Australian Brigade was &quot;so heavily outnumbered that defeat was inevitable&quot; and Costello states that Percival&#x27;s insistence on concentrating the 22nd Australian Brigade at the water&#x27;s edge had been a serious mistake. Yamashita, the Japanese commander, laid the blame on the British &quot;underestimating Japanese military capabilities&quot; and Percival&#x27;s hesitancy in reinforcing the Australians on the western side of the island.

A classified wartime report by Wavell released in 1992 blamed the Australians for the loss of Singapore. According to John Coates, the report &quot;lacked substance&quot;, for though there had undoubtedly been a lack of discipline in the final stages of the campaign—particularly among the poorly trained British, Indian and Australian reinforcements that were hurriedly dispatched as the crisis worsened—the 8th Australian Division had fought well and had gained the respect of the Japanese. At Gemas, Bakri and Jemaluang, &quot;they achieved the few outstanding tactical successes&quot; of the campaign in Malaya and although the Australians made up 13 per cent of the British Empire&#x27;s ground forces, they suffered 73 per cent of its battle deaths. Coates argues that the real reason for the fall of Singapore was the failure of the Singapore strategy, to which Australian policy-makers had contributed in their acquiescence and the lack of military resources allocated to the fighting in Malaya.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

The Japanese had advanced from Singora, Thailand, to the southern coast of Singapore at an average rate of a day. While impressed with Japan&#x27;s quick succession of victories, Adolf Hitler reportedly forbade Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop from issuing a congratulatory communique. Churchill called the fall of Singapore to the Japanese &quot;the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history&quot;. Churchill&#x27;s physician Lord Moran wrote:

The loss of Singapore, along with other defeats in Southeast Asia in 1942, reduced British prestige in the region. According to author Alan Warren, the Fall of Singapore shattered &quot;the British Empire&#x27;s illusion of permanence... and strength&quot;, ultimately making &quot;European empires in Asia unsustainable beyond the short term&quot; and presaging the end of colonialism in the region in the post war period.

===Casualties===
Nearly 85,000 British, Indian and Commonwealth troops were captured, in addition to losses during the earlier fighting in Malaya. About 5,000 men were killed or wounded, a majority of whom were Australian. Japanese casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded. During the 70-day campaign in Malaya and Singapore, total Commonwealth casualties amounted to 8,708 killed or wounded and 130,000 captured (38,496 United Kingdom, 18,490 Australian of whom 1,789 were killed and 1,306 wounded, 67,340 Indian and 14,382 local volunteer troops), against 9,824 Japanese casualties.

===Subsequent events===

The Japanese occupation of Singapore started after the British surrender. Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war. The city was renamed &quot;Syonan-to&quot; ( ; literally: &#x27;Southern Island gained in the age of Shōwa&#x27;, or &#x27;Light of the South&#x27;). Curtin compared the loss of Singapore to the Battle of Dunkirk. The Battle of Britain occurred after Dunkirk; &quot;the fall of Singapore opens the Battle for Australia&quot;, Curtin said, which threatened the Commonwealth, the United States, and the entire English-speaking world.

The Japanese sought vengeance against the Chinese and anyone who held anti-Japanese sentiments. The Japanese authorities were suspicious of the Chinese because of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and murdered thousands of citizen &quot;undesirables&quot; (mostly ethnic Chinese) in the Sook Ching massacre. The other ethnic groups of Singapore—such as the Malays and Indians—were not spared. Residents suffered great hardships under Japanese rule over the following three-and-a-half years. Numerous British and Australian soldiers taken prisoner remained in Singapore&#x27;s Changi Prison and many died in captivity. Thousands of others were transported by sea to other parts of Asia, including Japan, to be used as forced labour on projects such as the Siam–Burma Death Railway and Sandakan airfield in North Borneo. Many of those aboard the ships perished.
An Indian revolutionary, Rash Behari Bose, formed the pro-independence Indian National Army (INA) with the help of the Japanese, who were highly successful in recruiting Indian prisoners of war. In February 1942, out of approximately 40,000 Indian personnel in Singapore, about 30,000 joined the INA, of which about 7,000 fought Commonwealth forces in the Burma Campaign and in the northeast Indian regions of Kohima and Imphal; others became POW camp guards at Changi. An unknown number were taken to Japanese-occupied areas in the South Pacific as forced labour. Many of them suffered severe hardships and brutality similar to that experienced by other prisoners held by Japan during the war. About 6,000 survived until they could be liberated by Australian and US forces in 1943–1945, as the war in the Pacific turned in favour of the Allies.

A day after the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942, the 25th Army crossed the Singapore Strait and landed on Batam Island without resistance. The Dutch KNIL garrisons stationed on Batam had already abandoned the island on 14 February 1942, after hearing reports of the impending total collapse of Singapore across the strait. Six days after the fall of Singapore, Japanese forces captured Tanjungpinang, marking the complete fall of the Riau Islands under Japanese control.

Commando raids were carried out against Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour in Operation Jaywick (1943) and Operation Rimau (1944) to varying success. British forces had planned to reconquer Singapore in Operation Mailfist in 1945, but the war ended before it could be carried out. The island was re-occupied in Operation Tiderace by British, Indian and Australian forces following the surrender of Japan in September. Yamashita was tried by a US military commission for war crimes but not for crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore. He was convicted and hanged in the Philippines on 23 February 1946.

==Commemoration==
Since 1998, Singapore has observed Total Defence Day on 15 February each year, marking the anniversary of the surrender of Singapore. The concept of Total Defence as a national defence strategy was first introduced in 1984, which serves as a significant reminder that only Singaporeans with a stake in the country can effectively defend Singapore from future threats. Yearly observances on that day include:
* Since 1967, a memorial service is held at the War Memorial Park to recognise civilians who had lost their lives during the Japanese occupation;
* Since 1998, sirens on the Public Warning System are sounded throughout the country (initially at 12.05 p.m.), with the Singapore Civil Defence Force broadcasting an Important Message Signal through the sirens as well as local radio stations; and Singaporean schools conducting emergency preparedness drills, including food and electricity rationing exercises; and
* Since 2015, the timing for the sounding of the sirens has been shifted to 6.20 p.m., corresponding with the actual time of the surrender of Singapore in 1942.

<text>Pertica Alta (Brescian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot;, an Italian town of 559 inhabitants in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy. It is located in the upper part of the province and belongs to the Valle Sabbia mountain community.

Neighboring municipalities are Casto, Collio, Lodrino, Marmentino, Mura, Pertica Bassa. and Vestone.

==Physical geography==
Pertica Alta is located in the upper part of the province of Brescia, in Lombardy. It is located between the Val Trompia and the Valle Sabbia, circumscribed between the rivers Degnone and Tovere. The territory of Pertica Alta historically and geographically belongs to the Valle Sabbia. It lies in an area of low seismicity (seismic zone 3). [2] It belongs to Climate zone F, 3 496 GG [3]

==Origin of the name==
The origin of the name is to be found in the Langobard custom, according to which the relatives of a warrior lost or fallen in battle far from home erected a pole (Italian: pertica) mounted with a simulacrum of a dove facing the direction of the battle. Inhabitants of Pertica Alta are called Perticaroli.

==History==
The municipality of Pertica Alta was created in 1928 when the municipalities of Bel Prato, Livemmo and Navono were merged. The territory of Pertica Alta is a portion of the &quot;Universitas Perticae Vallis Sabbi&quot;, a supra-municipal organization existing since 1382. Until 1797, this organization included today&#x27;s territory of Pertica Bassa and the towns of Bisenzio and Presegno, which belong to the municipal administration of Lavenone.

==Symbols==
Pertica Alta&#x27;s coat of arms and the banner were granted by decree of the President of the Republic of May 13, 2003.
&quot;Compounded in a band: the first, in blue, with a star of six rays, in silver; the second, of silver, with two bands, of azure; the third, in red, to the small silver temple, enclosed in black, with four columns, two on each side, supporting the strong tympanum, this small temple with crepidoma of two steps, founded on a plain of green, accompanied by two firs, one and one, green, natural stems, knotted onto the plain. exterior ornaments of the comune.&quot;
The banner background is a green cloth.

The current coat of arms does not incorporate any of the elements present on the emblems of the municipalities which formed it: an ox passing through Livemmo, three border stones placed side by side for Navono, a rampant lion for Odeno. Instead, it is a variation of the one freely adopted by the municipality with a resolution of 6 January 1950, which depicted two blue bands for Belprato, symbolizing the course of the rivers Tovere and Degnone; the Roman sacellum on whose ruins the ancient church of Sant&#x27;Andrea, known as &quot;dei Morti&quot;, of Barbaine was built according to tradition, flanked by two firs, exemplary trees which grow in the local wood; the silver star for Navono, symbolizing the dependent fractions.

==Society==

, there were 595 inhabitants living in Pertica Alta.

From May 27, 1990, until June 14, 1999, the Mayor was Walter Lionello Piccini from the democrazia Cristiana.

From June 14, 1999, until June 8, 2009, the Mayor was Denis Alessandro Zanolini from Lega Nord.

Since June 8, 2009 the acting Mayor has been Giovanmaria Flocchini from Lega Nord.

==Human geography==
The municipality of Pertica Alta is divided into six hamlets:
* Lavino, seat of the preschool and of the primary school which form the Comprehensive Institute of Vestone; 
* Navono; 
* Noffo, an agglomeration of more recently built houses compared to the other hamlets. The town, unlike the others, has no church, so local Catholics have traditionally been referred to the parish church of Lavino dedicated to San Michele Arcangelo ; 
* Oden; 
* Livemmo, seat of the municipality, the rectory, of the Interactive Center of Museum Studies of the Pre-Alpine Culture of Pertica Alta and of the &quot;Maria Leali&quot; municipal library. It is known for its mountain walks and carnival parade. In 2018, Livemmo&#x27;s 196 residents had a birthrate of near zero and civic life was at a low point, but it invested in a small grocery store. In 2022, it received nearly 20 million euros in COVID recovery funds for Italy allocated by the European Union. 
* Belprato. It was an independent municipality until 1928 with the name Bel Prato. Until 1863 it was simply called Prato, but the prefix &quot;Bel&quot; was added with royal decree 11 January 1863, number 1126, in order to distinguish it from other homonymous municipalities of the kingdom of Italy.

Pertica Alta is crossed by the provincial road SP50 Tavernole-Nozza; this branches off from the municipality of Tavernole sul Mella and connects the Trompia Valley to the Sabbia Valley through the Termine Pass, the border point between the municipalities of Marmentino and Pertica Alta and, in full, between the Trompia and Sabbia valleys. Within the municipality of Pertica Alta it connects the villages of Lavino, Odeno, Livemmo and Belprato, then descending to the center of Nozza, a hamlet in the municipality of Vestone.

Pertica Alta is connected to the nearby municipality of Pertica Bassa by SP110 Forno d&#x27;Ono - Livemmo, a road that branches off from the town of Forno d&#x27;Ono di Pertica Bassa and crossing the hamlet of Avenone, joins up with SP50 Tavernole-Vestone in Livemmo di Pertica Alta.

<text>Ole Kirk Christiansen (born Ole Kirk Kristiansen; 7 April 1891 – 11 March 1958) was a Danish carpenter. In 1932, he founded the construction toy company Lego, later known as The Lego Group. Christiansen transformed his small woodworking shop, which initially sold household products, into a manufacturer of wooden toys. By 1934, he had officially named the company Lego and established its fundamental principles. The business shifted to producing plastic bricks after the acquisition of a plastic moulding injection machine in 1947. Following his death in 1958, the company&#x27;s management was handed over to his son, Godtfred.

==Early years==
Christiansen was born on 7 April 1891 in Omvraa Mark, Filskov, South Jutland, Denmark, which is 20 km northwest of Billund. He was one of 13 children of a farm labourer. His parents were Jens Niels Christiansen and Kirstine Christiansen. Although his family was poor, Christiansen was able to receive a basic high-school education. It was while he was working as a farmhand from the age of six that Christiansen developed a fascination with whittling wood, in between the two days per week that he attended school. In 1905, when Christiansen was 14, he began working as an apprentice for his older brother, Kristian Bonde Christiansen. In 1911, after his apprenticeship, he served in the military and studied at Haslev Technical School. After, he travelled abroad and went to work in carpentry in Germany and Norway before returning to Denmark.

== Wood-working business ==
In 1916, Christiansen returned to Denmark and settled in Billund. He bought a carpentry shop with the money he had saved and named it Billund Maskinsnedkeri og Tømreforretning (Billund Woodworking and Carpentry Shop). During the late 1920s, the business focused on restoring and developing new buildings and also producing household goods for the local community. In 1924, Christiansen&#x27;s business was almost destroyed when his sons, Karl Georg and Godtfred, caused a fire to break out by accidentally setting fire to wood shavings in the workshop while trying to light a hot glue machine. Consequently, both the workshop and the family home burned down. Following this event, Christiansen decided to expand his business and employed an architect to build a larger workshop and family home. The construction of the house, which is situated on Hovedgaden in Billund, was completed in 1924 with two stone lions placed at its entrance. By 1930, Christiansen employed a small workforce to maintain his growing business.

== Family and personal life ==
While establishing his business, Christiansen met Kirstine Sörensen, the daughter of a local cheese-maker. They married in 1916 and had four children. Sörensen died in 1932 after the birth of their fourth child. Two years later, Christiansen married Sofie Jörgensen and they had one daughter. Christiansen was a member of the conservative and pietistic Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark.

==Beginnings of Lego==

During the early 1930s, Christiansen&#x27;s business was impacted by the onset of the Great Depression in Denmark. The drop in farming prices resulted in many of his customers being unable to afford his products. This decline in business forced Christiansen to lay off staff in early 1932 until only seven employees remained. The primary income, which was from sales of ladders and ironing boards, was shrinking in demand. Eventually, Christiansen had to dismiss his last worker. In order to sell more products, he made the decision to produce cheap wooden products, including wooden toys. With the business slipping into bankruptcy, he refused to stop producing toys when his siblings requested this as part of a bailout loan. He decided to officially found an unnamed company (later to become Lego) in 1932.

Christiansen&#x27;s company moved primarily to the production of wooden toys, such as yo-yos, pull-along animals and trucks. He consequently decided to focus his products on the development of children. With this decision, Christiansen defined the core philosophy of the company, which was expressed in its name in 1934. Lego is a shortened form of the Danish word &quot;Leg godt&quot;, meaning &quot;play well&quot;. The company eventually became known as The Lego Group. Years later, he said, &quot;Not until the day when I said to myself, &#x27;You must make a choice between carpentry and toys&#x27; did I find the real answer.&quot;

Christiansen made his toy products from birch wood that had been cut from the forest, dried out for two years and then dried in a kiln for three weeks. The toys were put together, sealed, sanded and primed before being painted with three coats of varnish. Although he struggled to sell his household products and wooden toys due to the poverty levels of people living in the local community, he continued to produce toys, sometimes exchanging them for food. By 1935, the toy range included a variety of animals, including a pull-along wooden duck, which has since seen numerous variations.

== 1940s and 1950s ==
Christiansen maintained his business through the Great Depression and Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Denmark in World War II. In 1942, the company experienced another setback. A short circuit created an electrical fire, which resulted in the loss of his factory and his entire stock and blueprints. Following this, he decided to start again out of a sense of responsibility towards his workforce. In 1944, his new factory now incorporated an assembly line.

At the end of World War II, many traditional materials used in the manufacture of products were not readily available, so manufacturers looked for other cheap, plastic alternatives. In 1947, the Lego company was the first toy manufacturer in Denmark to purchase a plastic injection moulding machine, which was so expensive that it cost more than twice the previous year&#x27;s profits. This transition into producing plastic toys was challenging for Christiansen, as he had spent his life working with wood. By 1949, the business was producing a plastic product called the Automatic Binding Brick. In 1950, Christiansen&#x27;s son Godtfred was named &quot;Junior Managing Director&quot; and the company spent the next decade focusing on the development of the plastic brick, which was modified from a self-locking building brick invented by Hilary Fisher Page. Despite poor sales in the early 1950s, the company eventually developed a plastic brick using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), which was necessary for achieving the &quot;clutch power&quot; or friction that holds two bricks together. This design for the Lego brick was patented in Copenhagen on 28 January 1958.

==Death==
On 11 March 1958, Christiansen experienced a cardiac arrest and died at the age of 66. His third son Godtfred took over the company until his death in 1995. Ole died just before his son used the Automatic Binding Brick as the basis for the company&#x27;s &quot;System of Play&quot;, which was the foundation of the modern Lego building toy.

== Legacy ==
In 1964, Ole Kirk&#x27;s Foundation, a charitable foundation in Denmark was established in his memory. On 6 September 2023, Parco Ole Kirk Kristiansen, a park located in a northwest area of Rome was named after Christiansen in an official naming ceremony.

<text>John Martin Cummins (born March 12, 1942) is a Canadian politician. He was the leader of the British Columbia Conservative Party from 2011 until resigning after the 2013 election. He was the Conservative Member of Parliament for the riding of Delta—Richmond East in British Columbia from 1993 until 2011, when he turned to provincial politics becoming the leader of the unaffiliated provincial party.

Born in Georgetown, Ontario, he was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1993 election, as a Reform Party member. He was re-elected in 1997, 2000 (as a member of the Canadian Alliance), 2004, 2006, and 2008 (as a Conservative).

==Education==
Cummins obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Western Ontario where he attended King&#x27;s University College and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of British Columbia.

==Before politics==
Before entering politics, Cummins worked in the pulp and paper industry in Ontario, the oil fields of Alberta and on the construction of the Bennett hydroelectric dam in Northern BC. He taught school in the Northwest Territories and in the Peace River district of Northern Alberta, then spent fifteen years teaching in Delta, British Columbia. Cummins is also a commercial fisherman; he owned and operated commercial fishing boats in BC for over 20 years.

==Politics==
As a Member of Parliament, Cummins served twice as party critic for Fisheries and Oceans, in addition to his work on various other House of Commons and Joint Committees.

On October 19, 2010, Bill Tieleman wrote about John Cummins convention speech where Tieleman writes that &quot;the BC Conservatives are going to target not only disgruntled BC Liberal voters but also the NDP&#x27;s traditional support bases&quot;.

On March 12, 2011, Cummins announced that he would not be seeking re-election in the federal election held on May 2, 2011. On March 29, 2011, Cummins announced he would seek the leadership of the British Columbia Conservative Party, and was acclaimed leader at the party&#x27;s convention on May 28, 2011.

On November 28, 2011, Cummins recommended that a review of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in BC, including whether a provincial police force should be considered. This was announced following a review from Brian Peckford.

==Controversies==
During an interview on CFAX 1070 Radio on May 11, 2011, prior to becoming leader of the BC Conservatives, Cummins was questioned by the host of the radio show about his stance on gay rights following a suggestion that homosexuality was a choice. His response was: &quot;That&#x27;s my understanding of the issue,&quot;. He followed up by stating &quot;There are folks that will tell you they&#x27;re born that way, and that&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t discriminate&quot;. He issued an apology a couple days later, saying &quot;My comments on CFAX radio this past Wednesday may have been misinterpreted and may have offended some. I apologize for that&quot;.

<text>William Sheffield Cowles (August 1, 1846 – May 1, 1923) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy.

==Naval career==
In July 1863 he was appointed an acting midshipman at the United States Naval Academy and graduated in June 1867. He was commissioned as an ensign in December 1868. He rose through the ranks and was commissioned as a commander in June 1898.

Cowles commanded the gunboat, during the Spanish–American War, and served as naval aide to President McKinley. He was in command of the battleship when it collided with the , and when thirty-three men were killed in an explosion (he was cleared of responsibility in both cases).

He served as the Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet, and retired from the Navy in August 1908 after 45 years in service.

He was a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and an honorary companion of the Connecticut Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.

On December 2, 1908, Cowles submitted a report, prepared by Lieutenant George C. Sweet, recommending the purchase of aircraft suitable for operating from naval ships on scouting and observation mission to the Secretary of the Navy.

Cowles was an official representative at the coronation of King George V in 1911.

==Personal life==
Cowles married Mary Thurman, the oldest daughter of Ohio politician Allen G. Thurman, on February 18, 1873. In November 1889, Thurman divorced Cowles. They did not have any children.

On November 25, 1895, he married Anna &quot;Bamie&quot; Roosevelt, daughter of philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. and socialite Martha Stewart &quot;Mittie&quot; Bulloch and elder sister of President Theodore &quot;T.R.&quot; Roosevelt Jr. William and Bamie had one son, William Jr. (1898–1986), who was a Connecticut State Representative and Mayor of Farmington, Connecticut. William and Bamie are buried at Riverside Cemetery in Farmington, Connecticut.

<text>Cornell Glen CM (born 21 October 1981) is a Trinidadian former professional footballer who played as a forward.

==Club career==
Glen began his professional career in 1999 with Trinidadian club FUTGOF. After two years with FUTGOF, Glen moved to Portugal, where he played for Sanjoanense. After playing slightly over a season there, he returned to Trinidad and Tobago, where he joined San Juan Jabloteh. Glen dominated the league with Jabloteh, leading the club to two consecutive league championships in 2002 and 2003, while registering 12 and 26 goals in the respective seasons.

After scoring a hat trick in a CONCACAF Champions Cup game against the Chicago Fire on 17 March 2004, Glen was bought by the MetroStars of Major League Soccer. In his first season Glen made a significant impact, registering six goals and two assists as he competed for playing time on a very crowded MetroStars front line.

Glen was traded to FC Dallas after the year for a first round pick in the 2005 MLS SuperDraft, but as the club had also acquired Carlos Ruiz he could not find any playing time among Dallas&#x27;s other options at striker. Glen was traded to the Columbus Crew early in the 2005 season for a future draft pick without ever suiting up for Dallas. After scoring four goals for the Crew, he was on the move again after the season, being dealt to the Colorado Rapids for Ritchie Kotschau. Glen played only one game for the Rapids—the opener of the 2006 season—before being traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy.

In his Galaxy debut he scored two late goals in the &quot;SuperClasico&quot; against Chivas USA from Landon Donovan assists, which turned around the 1–0 score and gave the &quot;sash&quot; a 2–1 win. His late-game heroics made Glen an instant fan favorite in Los Angeles.

Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup Glen returned to action with the Galaxy in U.S. Open Cup play against the Colorado Rapids, but aggravated an injury he suffered during the World Cup, and missed the rest of the season. He was waived by the Galaxy during the 2007 pre-season.

After briefly returning to Trinidad to play for San Juan Jabloteh in 2007, Glen trialled Leeds United from the English Coca-Cola Football League One in January 2008, but was not offered a contract.

Glen went on trial with Major League Soccer side San Jose Earthquakes in May 2009 and successfully signed a one-year deal with the club shortly thereafter. He scored his first goal for San Jose on 30 May 2009 against Real Salt Lake and ended the 2009 season with four goals as San Jose struggled in the standings. Much of Glen&#x27;s time with the Earthquakes was plagued by injuries, and following a statistically disappointing 2010 season his contract was not renewed by the San Jose club.

He joined Caledonia AIA in April 2011. Glen agreed to a six-month deal with Sông Lam Nghệ An of the V-League in December 2011. Upon return to Trinidad and Tobago, he signed with North East Stars for the 2012–13 season. On 17 June 2013, Glen signed for an I-League club Shillong Lajong for 2 years. He scored 16 goals for the club in 2014–15 season.

Glen signed with Mohun Bagan A.C. on 7 October 2015. On 8 January 2016, he made his debut, scoring twice in a 3–1 win over Aizawl.

In the 2015–16 season of I-League, he emerged as the top goal scorer of Mohun Bagan with 11 goals.

After a season with Mohun Bagan, Glen signed with Bangalore Super Division outfit Ozone FC from Bangalore on 2 August 2016.

==International career==
Glen (whose name is often misspelled &quot;Glenn&quot;) has been a regular for Trinidad and Tobago since 2002, and was named in the squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Glen appeared in all three of Trinidad &amp; Tobago&#x27;s games at the World Cup. His shot nearly upset Sweden in the Caribbean team&#x27;s historic World Cup debut which ended in a draw. Trinidad &amp; Tobago were eliminated in the first round after losing to England and Paraguay, but Glen&#x27;s performances during the tournament earned him praise and recognition.

<text>The 1978 United States Senate elections were held on November 7, in the middle of Democratic President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s term. The 33 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies.

Thirteen seats changed hands between parties, resulting in a net gain of three seats for the Republicans allowing them to break the Democrats&#x27; filibuster-proof majority. Democrats nevertheless retained a 58–41 majority.

== Change in composition ==
=== Before the elections ===
=== After the elections ===


== Race summary ==

In these special elections, the winner was seated during 1978 or before January 3, 1979; ordered by election date, then state.

=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===
In these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 1979; ordered by state.

All of the elections involved the Class 2 seats.

== Closest races ==
Nine races had a margin of victory under 10%:

Oklahoma was the tipping point state with a margin of 32.6%.

== Alabama ==

There were two elections in Alabama, due to the death of senator Jim Allen.

=== Alabama (regular) ===

Democrat John Sparkman retired and was succeeded by Howell Heflin, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama. Heflin, the Democratic candidate, faced no Republican opponent in the general election, defeating Prohibition Party nominee Jerome B. Couch.



=== Alabama (special) ===

Following the death of senator Jim Allen, his widow Maryon was appointed by governor George Wallace to fill the vacancy until a special election could be held. In this election, Democratic state senator Donald W. Stewart defeated former Republican congressman James D. Martin to serve the remaining two years of the term.





== Alaska ==

Republican Ted Stevens won reelection to a second full (his third total) term, defeating Democrat Donald Hobbs.



== Arkansas ==

Following the death of senator John L. McClellan, then Kaneaster Hodges Jr. was appointed by governor David Pryor to fill the vacancy until a special election could be held. In this election, Democratic state governor David Pryor defeated former Republican challenger Thomas Kelly Jr. to serve the six-year term.





== Colorado ==

Democrat Floyd Haskell decided to run for re-election to a second term, but was defeated by William L. Armstrong, the Republican nominee and the U.S. Representative.





== Delaware ==


Democratic United States senator Joe Biden won re-election to a second term, defeating Republican challenger James H. Baxter Jr., the Delaware Secretary of Agriculture.




== Georgia ==


Democrat Sam Nunn won re-election to a second term.



== Idaho ==


Republican James A. McClure was elected to a second term in office.



== Illinois ==


Republican Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate. Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith (D), attorney and former member of the Cook County Zoning Board of Appeals. Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive. In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, &quot;I got your message and you&#x27;re right.&quot; Percy&#x27;s last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.





== Iowa ==

Democrat Dick Clark decided to run for re-election to a second term, but was defeated by Roger Jepsen, the Republican nominee and former Lieutenant Governor of Iowa.





== Kansas ==

Republican James B. Pearson retired and was succeeded by Nancy Kassebaum, the daughter of Alf Landon, defeating Democratic nominee William R. Roy, the former U.S. Representative. Roy also lost to Bob Dole in the 1974 election for Kansas&#x27; other Senate seat.





== Kentucky ==


Democrat Walter Huddleston was re-elected to a second term.





== Louisiana ==

Democrat J. Bennett Johnston won re-election to unopposed and his second term.


== Maine ==


Democrat William Hathaway decided to run for re-election to a second term, but was defeated by William Cohen, the Republican nominee and the United States Congressman from Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and Hayes Gahagan, former Maine State Senator




== Massachusetts ==


Republican Edward Brooke was defeated by Democratic congressman Paul E. Tsongas.








== Michigan ==


Republican Robert P. Griffin ran for re-election to a third term, but was defeated by the Democratic candidate, and former Detroit City Council President Carl Levin.
 
 



== Minnesota ==

There were two elections in Minnesota, due to the death of Hubert Humphrey.

=== Minnesota (regular) ===

Democrat Wendell Anderson was defeated by Republican challenger businessman Rudy Boschwitz.

In 1978, all three key statewide races in Minnesota were up for election—the Governorship, and both Senate Seats (the other Senate seat belonged to Hubert Humphrey, who died in 1978). But, there was a particular oddity to the three races—all three had incumbents who were never elected to the office in the first place. This became a well played issue by the Republicans—a billboard put up across the state read, &quot;The DFL is going to face something scary -- an election&quot;.

When Walter Mondale resigned after being elected to the Vice Presidency in 1976, sitting Governor Wendell Anderson resigned in order to be appointed by his successor Rudy Perpich to the open seat. This act did not sit well with the electorate. Plywood magnate Rudy Boschwitz campaigned as a liberal Republican and spent freely of his own money, but all that seemed to really matter was that he was neither a DFLer or Wendell Anderson in an election cycle where both were rejected by the voters. The result was not even close—the challenger Boschwitz won in a 16-point landslide as all three statewide offices switched into Republican hands.











=== Minnesota (special) ===

Incumbent Muriel Humphrey retired. Democratic candidate Bob Short was defeated by Republican candidate David Durenberger.

In 1978, all three key statewide races in Minnesota were up for election—the Governorship, and both Senate Seats (the other Senate seat belonged to Wendell Anderson, who, as Governor of Minnesota, appointed himself to fill the seat vacated by Walter Mondale, when Mondale ascended to the Vice Presidency in 1976). But, there was a particular oddity to the three races—all three had incumbents who were never elected to the office in the first place. This became a well played issue by the Republicans: a billboard put up across the state read, &quot;The DFL is going to face something scary — an election&quot;.

When Hubert H. Humphrey died in office in January 1978, sitting Governor Rudy Perpich appointed Humphrey&#x27;s widow, Muriel to sit until a special election could be held later that year. However, Muriel Humphrey opted not to seek election to the seat in her own right, and the DFL nominated former Texas Rangers owner Bob Short to run in the subsequent special election. The Independent-Republicans, on their part, nominated the liberal Republican David Durenberger, creating an unusual race in which the DFL candidate was positioned to the right of the Independent-Republican candidate. In addition to the general sense of dissatisfaction voters felt for the DFL, the DFL also had to contend with a large number of liberal members of the DFL, who were dissatisfied with Short&#x27;s positions on hot button issues such as abortion, motorboat usage in the Boundary Waters Canoe area, and government spending, crossing party lines to vote for Durenberger. As a result, Durenberger won in a 26.9-percent landslide as the governorship and both U.S. Senate seats switched into Republican hands.










== Mississippi ==


Democrat James Eastland retired. Republican Thad Cochran won the open seat over Democrat Maurice Dantin, former District Attorney and Independent Charles Evers, Mayor of Fayette.

Evers was the first African American elected since the Reconstruction era to be mayor in any Mississippi city in 1969. He ran as an independent, and as a result his campaign divided the Democrats and allowed Cochran to win the senate seat with a 45 percent plurality. This made him the first Republican in a century to win a statewide election in Mississippi for any office except US President. Eastland resigned on December 27, 1978, to give Cochran a seniority advantage over new incoming senators.
 
 



== Montana ==

Following the death of senator Lee Metcalf on January 12, 1978, Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul G. Hatfield was appointed to serve for the remainder of Metcalf&#x27;s term. Hatfield opted to run for a full term in office, but was overwhelmingly defeated in the Democratic primary by Congressman Max Baucus of the 1st congressional district. Baucus advanced to the general election, where he was opposed by Larry R. Williams, an author and the Republican nominee. Baucus ended up defeating Williams by a solid margin to win his first term in the Senate, and, following Hatfield&#x27;s resignation on December 12, 1978, he began serving his first term in the Senate.








== Nebraska ==


Republican Carl Curtis retired instead of seeking a fifth term. In the elections, Democratic nominee J. James Exon won the open seat over Republican Donald Eugene Shasteen.




== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Democrat Thomas J. McIntyre decided to run for re-election to a fourth term, but was defeated by Gordon J. Humphrey, the Republican nominee also a professional pilot and conservative activist.




== New Jersey ==


Republican Clifford P. Case narrowly lost renomination to anti-tax conservative Jeff Bell, but the Democratic nominee, former professional basketball player Bill Bradley, easily won the general election.












== New Mexico ==


Republican senator Pete Domenici successfully ran for re-election to a second term, defeating Democrat Toney Anaya, Attorney General of New Mexico.



== North Carolina ==

The general election was fought between the Republican Incumbent Jesse Helms and Democrat John Ingram. Helms won re-election, by a slightly wider margin than in 1972.






Jesse Helms won the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination unopposed.



== Oklahoma ==

Republican Dewey F. Bartlett retired instead of seeking a second term due to his declining health. In the elections, Democratic nominee David Boren won the open seat over Republican Robert B. Kamm.




Bartlett died 2 months after leaving the U.S. Senate

== Oregon ==

Republican senator Mark Hatfield successfully ran for re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Vernon Cook, State Legislator and candidate for U.S. Representative in 1970 and 1974.




== Rhode Island ==


Democrat Claiborne Pell successfully sought re-election, defeating Republican James G. Reynolds.







== South Carolina ==

Popular incumbent Republican Strom Thurmond defeated Democratic challenger Charles D. Ravenel.

The South Carolina Democratic Party held their primary for governor on June 13, 1978. Charles D. Ravenel, an unsuccessful candidate in the 1974 gubernatorial contest, originally planned to run for governor again in 1978, but was convinced by Vice President Walter Mondale in 1977 to run for senator. He garnered over 50% of the vote in the primary and avoided a runoff election.



Senator Strom Thurmond faced no opposition from South Carolina Republicans and avoided a primary election.

Thurmond generally ignored Ravenel on the campaign and refused to debate him. When they did cross paths, Thurmond criticized Ravenel for never having held a political office. Ravenel did not help his cause by his actions in the 1974 gubernatorial race when he refused to endorse the Democratic nominee after he had been disqualified. This irritated many Democrats and they also accused him of being nothing more than a liberal New Yorker. Age was beginning to become an issue with Thurmond, so to combat perceptions of old age, Thurmond often appeared with his children on the campaign trail. While 1978 was generally a Democratic year, Thurmond was able to pull off a commanding victory over Ravenel.




== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Democrat James Abourezk retired instead of seeking a second term. In the elections, Republican congressman Larry Pressler won the open seat over Democratic former mayor of Rapid City Don Barnett, thus becoming the first Vietnam veteran to serve in the Senate



== Tennessee ==

Two-term popular incumbent Howard Baker, who had served as United States Senate Minority Leader since 1977, ran for reelection against first-time candidate and Democratic Party activist Jane Eskind.

In the August 3 Democratic primary Eskind won in an open primary against eight other candidates:

* Eskind - 196,156 (34.52%)
* Bruce - 170,795 (30.06%)
* Lee - 89,939 (15.83%)
* Boyd - 48,458 (8.53%)
* Bradley - 22,130 (3.90%)
* Heinsohn - 17,787 (3.13%)
* Foster - 10,671 (1.88%)
* Nyabongo - 7,682 (1.35%)
* Vick - 4,414 (0.78%)
* Write-in - 147 (0.03%)

In the Republican primary, also held August 3, Baker easily emerged as the winner:

* Baker - 205,680 (83.44%)
* Howard - 21,154 (8.58%)
* Boles - 8,899 (3.61%)
* Patty - 3,941 (1.60%)
* Seiler - 3,831 (1.55%)
* Trapp - 2,994 (1.22%)

Baker won with a 15-point margin in the general election, held on November 7:




== Texas ==

Republican incumbent John Tower won re-election to a fourth term over Democrat Bob Krueger, U.S. Congressman of Texas&#x27;s 21st congressional district.




== Virginia ==


Incumbent William L. Scott retired. Former Secretary of the Navy Republican John Warner beat Attorney General of Virginia Andrew P. Miller. Scott then resigned January 1, 1979 and Warner was appointed January 2, 1979 for early seniority purposes.




== West Virginia ==

Democratic incumbent Jennings Randolph won re-election to a fifth term over Republican Arch Moore, former governor of West Virginia.



== Wyoming ==

Incumbent Republican Clifford Hansen retired instead of seeking a third term. In the elections, Republican nominee Alan K. Simpson won the open seat over Democrat Raymond B. Whitaker, an attorney from Casper and nominee for U.S. Senate in 1960.

|caption=An example of KIE. In the reaction of methyl bromide with cyanide, the KIE of the carbon in the methyl group was found to be 1.082 ± 0.008.}}
In physical organic chemistry, a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is the change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction when one of the atoms in the reactants is replaced by one of its isotopes. Formally, it is the ratio of rate constants for the reactions involving the light (&quot;k&quot;) and the heavy (&quot;k&quot;) isotopically substituted reactants (isotopologues): KIE = &quot;k/k&quot;.

This change in reaction rate is a quantum effect that occurs mainly because heavier isotopologues have lower vibrational frequencies than their lighter counterparts. In most cases, this implies a greater energy input needed for heavier isotopologues to reach the transition state (or, in rare cases, dissociation limit), and therefore, a slower reaction rate. The study of KIEs can help elucidate reaction mechanisms, and is occasionally exploited in drug development to improve unfavorable pharmacokinetics by protecting metabolically vulnerable C-H bonds.

== Background ==
KIE is considered one of the most essential and sensitive tools for studying reaction mechanisms, the knowledge of which allows improvement of the desirable qualities of said reactions. For example, KIEs can be used to reveal whether a nucleophilic substitution reaction follows a unimolecular (S1) or bimolecular (S2) pathway.

In the reaction of methyl bromide and cyanide (shown in the introduction), the observed methyl carbon KIE is 1.082, a small effect which indicates an S2 mechanism in which the C-Br bond is formed as the C-CN bond is broken. For S1 reactions in which the leaving group leaves first to form a trivalent carbon transition state, the KIE is close to the maximum observed value for a secondary KIE (SKIE, see below) of 1.22. Depending on the pathway, different strategies may be used to stabilize the transition state of the rate-determining step of the reaction and improve the reaction rate and selectivity, which are important for industrial applications.

Isotopic rate changes are most pronounced when the relative mass change is greatest, since the effect is related to vibrational frequencies of the affected bonds. Thus, replacing normal hydrogen (H) with its isotope deuterium (D or H), doubles the mass; whereas in replacing carbon-12 with carbon-13, the mass increases by only 8%. The rate of a reaction involving a C–H bond is typically 6–10x faster than with a C–H bond, whereas a C reaction is only 4% faster than the corresponding C reaction; even though, in both cases, the isotope is one atomic mass unit (amu) (dalton) heavier.

Isotopic substitution can modify the reaction rate in a variety of ways. In many cases, the rate difference can be rationalized by noting that the mass of an atom affects the vibrational frequency of the chemical bond that it forms, even if the potential energy surface for the reaction is nearly identical. Heavier isotopes will (classically) lead to lower vibration frequencies, or, viewed quantum mechanically, have lower zero-point energy (ZPE). With a lower ZPE, more energy must be supplied to break the bond, resulting in a higher activation energy for bond cleavage, which in turn lowers the measured rate (see, for example, the Arrhenius equation).

== Classification ==

=== Primary kinetic isotope effects ===
A primary kinetic isotope effect (PKIE) may be found when a bond to the isotopically labeled atom is being formed or broken. Depending on the way a KIE is probed (parallel measurement of rates vs. intermolecular competition vs. intramolecular competition), the observation of a PKIE is indicative of breaking/forming a bond to the isotope at the rate-limiting step, or subsequent product-determining step(s). (The misconception that a PKIE must reflect bond cleavage/formation to the isotope at the rate-limiting step is often repeated in textbooks and the primary literature: &quot;see the section on experiments below.&quot;)

For the aforementioned nucleophilic substitution reactions, PKIEs have been investigated for both the leaving groups, the nucleophiles, and the α-carbon at which the substitution occurs. Interpretation of the leaving group KIEs was difficult at first due to significant contributions from temperature independent factors. KIEs at the α-carbon can be used to develop some understanding into the symmetry of the transition state in S2 reactions, though this KIE is less sensitive than what would be ideal, also due to contribution from non-vibrational factors.

=== Secondary kinetic isotope effects ===
A secondary kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) is observed when no bond to the isotopically labeled atom in the reactant is broken or formed. SKIEs tend to be much smaller than PKIEs; however, secondary deuterium isotope effects can be as large as 1.4 per H atom, and techniques have been developed to measure heavy-element isotope effects to very high precision, so SKIEs are still very useful for elucidating reaction mechanisms.

For the aforementioned nucleophilic substitution reactions, secondary hydrogen KIEs at the α-carbon provide a direct means to distinguish between S1 and S2 reactions. It has been found that S1 reactions typically lead to large SKIEs, approaching to their theoretical maximum at about 1.22, while S2 reactions typically yield SKIEs that are very close to or less than 1. KIEs greater than 1 are called normal kinetic isotope effects, while KIEs less than 1 are called inverse kinetic isotope effects (IKIE). In general, smaller force constants in the transition state are expected to yield a normal KIE, and larger force constants in the transition state are expected to yield an IKIE when stretching vibrational contributions dominate the KIE.

The magnitudes of such SKIEs at the α-carbon atom are largely determined by the C-H(H) vibrations. For an S1 reaction, since the carbon atom is converted into an sp hybridized carbenium ion during the transition state for the rate-determining step with an increase in C-H(H) bond order, an IKIE would be expected if only the stretching vibrations were important. The observed large normal KIEs are found to be caused by significant out-of-plane bending vibrational contributions when going from the reactants to the transition state of carbenium ion formation. For S2 reactions, bending vibrations still play an important role for the KIE, but stretching vibrational contributions are of more comparable magnitude, and the resulting KIE may be normal or inverse depending on the specific contributions of the respective vibrations.

== Theory ==
Theoretical treatment of isotope effects relies heavily on transition state theory, which assumes a single potential energy surface for the reaction, and a barrier between the reactants and the products on this surface, on top of which resides the transition state. The KIE arises largely from the changes to vibrational ground states produced by the isotopic perturbation along the minimum energy pathway of the potential energy surface, which may only be accounted for with quantum mechanical treatments of the system. Depending on the mass of the atom that moves along the reaction coordinate and nature (width and height) of the energy barrier, quantum tunneling may also make a large contribution to an observed KIE and may need to be separately considered, in addition to the &quot;semi-classical&quot; transition state theory model.

The deuterium kinetic isotope effect (H KIE) is by far the most common, useful, and well-understood type of KIE. The accurate prediction of the numerical value of a H KIE using density functional theory calculations is now fairly routine. Moreover, several qualitative and semi-quantitative models allow rough estimates of deuterium isotope effects to be made without calculations, often providing enough information to rationalize experimental data or even support or refute different mechanistic possibilities. Starting materials containing H are often commercially available, making the synthesis of isotopically enriched starting materials relatively straightforward. Also, due to the large relative difference in the mass of H and H and the attendant differences in vibrational frequency, the isotope effect is larger than for any other pair of isotopes except H and H, allowing both primary and secondary isotope effects to be easily measured and interpreted. In contrast, secondary effects are generally very small for heavier elements and close in magnitude to the experimental uncertainty, which complicates their interpretation and limits their utility. In the context of isotope effects, &quot;hydrogen&quot; often means the light isotope, protium (H), specifically. In the rest of this article, reference to &quot;hydrogen&quot; and &quot;deuterium&quot; in parallel grammatical constructions or direct comparisons between them should be taken to mean H and H.

The theory of KIEs was first formulated by Jacob Bigeleisen in 1949. Bigeleisen&#x27;s general formula for H KIEs (which is also applicable to heavier elements) is given below. It employs transition state theory and a statistical mechanical treatment of translational, rotational, and vibrational levels for the calculation of rate constants &quot;k&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. However, this formula is &quot;semi-classical&quot; in that it neglects the contribution from quantum tunneling, which is often introduced as a separate correction factor. Bigeleisen&#x27;s formula also does not deal with differences in non-bonded repulsive interactions caused by the slightly shorter C–H bond compared to a C–H bond. In the equation, subscript H or D refer to the species with H or H, respectively; quantities with or without the double-dagger, ‡, refer to transition state or reactant ground state, respectively. (Strictly speaking, a formula_1 term resulting from an isotopic difference in transmission coefficients should also be included.)

:formula_2,

where we define

:formula_3 and formula_4.

Here, &quot;h&quot; = Planck constant; &quot;k&quot; = Boltzmann constant; formula_5 = frequency of vibration, expressed in wavenumber; &quot;c&quot; = speed of light; &quot;N&quot; = Avogadro constant; and &quot;R&quot; = universal gas constant. The σ (X = H or D) are the symmetry numbers for the reactants and transition states. The &quot;M&quot; are the molecular masses of the corresponding species, and the &quot;I&quot; (&quot;q&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot;) terms are the moments of inertia about the three principal axes. The &quot;u&quot; are directly proportional to the corresponding vibrational frequencies, &quot;ν&quot;, and the vibrational zero-point energy (ZPE) (see below). The integers &quot;N&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are the number of atoms in the reactants and the transition states, respectively. The complicated expression given above can be represented as the product of four separate factors:

:formula_6.

For the special case of H isotope effects, we will argue that the first three terms can be treated as equal to or well approximated by unity. The first factor S (containing σ) is the ratio of the symmetry numbers for the various species. This will be a rational number (a ratio of integers) that depends on the number of molecular and bond rotations leading to the permutation of identical atoms or groups in the reactants and the transition state. For systems of low symmetry, all σ (reactant and transition state) will be unity; thus S can often be neglected. The MMI factor (containing the &quot;M&quot; and &quot;I&quot;) refers to the ratio of the molecular masses and the moments of inertia. Since hydrogen and deuterium tend to be much lighter than most reactants and transition states, there is little difference in the molecular masses and moments of inertia between H and D containing molecules, so the MMI factor is usually also approximated as unity. The EXC factor (containing the product of vibrational partition functions) corrects for the KIE caused by the reactions of vibrationally excited molecules. The fraction of molecules with enough energy to have excited state A–H/D bond vibrations is generally small for reactions at or near room temperature (bonds to hydrogen usually vibrate at 1000 cm or higher, so exp(-&quot;u&quot;) = exp(-&quot;hν&quot;/&quot;k&#x27;T&quot;) &lt; 0.01 at 298 K, resulting in negligible contributions from the 1–exp(-&quot;u&quot;) factors). Hence, for hydrogen/deuterium KIEs, the observed values are typically dominated by the last factor, ZPE (an exponential function of vibrational ZPE differences), consisting of contributions from the ZPE differences for each of the vibrational modes of the reactants and transition state, which can be represented as follows:

:formula_7,

where we define

:formula_8 and formula_9.

The sums in the exponent of the second expression can be interpreted as running over all vibrational modes of the reactant ground state and the transition state. Or, one may interpret them as running over those modes unique to the reactant or the transition state or whose vibrational frequencies change substantially upon advancing along the reaction coordinate. The remaining pairs of reactant and transition state vibrational modes have very similar formula_10 and formula_11, and cancellations occur when the sums in the exponent are calculated. Thus, in practice, H KIEs are often largely dependent on a handful of key vibrational modes because of this cancellation, making qualitative analyses of &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; possible.

As mentioned, especially for H/H substitution, most KIEs arise from the difference in ZPE between the reactants and the transition state of the isotopologues; this difference can be understood qualitatively as follows: in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the potential energy surface is the same for both isotopic species. However, a quantum treatment of the energy introduces discrete vibrational levels onto this curve, and the lowest possible energy state of a molecule corresponds to the lowest vibrational energy level, which is slightly higher in energy than the minimum of the potential energy curve. This difference, known as the ZPE, is a manifestation of the uncertainty principle that necessitates an uncertainty in the C-H or C-D bond length. Since the heavier (in this case the deuterated) species behaves more &quot;classically&quot;, its vibrational energy levels are closer to the classical potential energy curve, and it has a lower ZPE. The ZPE differences between the two isotopic species, at least in most cases, diminish in the transition state, since the bond force constant decreases during bond breaking. Hence, the lower ZPE of the deuterated species translates into a larger activation energy for its reaction, as shown in the following figure, leading to a normal KIE. This effect should, in principle, be taken into account all 3&quot;N−&quot;6 vibrational modes for the starting material and 3&quot;N&quot;&quot;−&quot;7 vibrational modes at the transition state (one mode, the one corresponding to the reaction coordinate, is missing at the transition state, since a bond breaks and there is no restorative force against the motion). The harmonic oscillator is a good approximation for a vibrating bond, at least for low-energy vibrational states. Quantum mechanics gives the vibrational ZPE as formula_12. Thus, we can readily interpret the factor of and the sums of formula_13 terms over ground state and transition state vibrational modes in the exponent of the simplified formula above. For a harmonic oscillator, vibrational frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the reduced mass of the vibrating system:

:formula_14,

where &quot;k&quot; is the force constant. Moreover, the reduced mass is approximated by the mass of the light atom of the system, X = H or D. Because &quot;m&quot; ≈ 2&quot;m&quot;,

:formula_15.

In the case of homolytic C–H/D bond dissociation, the transition state term disappears; and neglecting other vibrational modes, &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; = exp(Δ&quot;u&quot;). Thus, a larger isotope effect is observed for a stiffer (&quot;stronger&quot;) C–H/D bond. For most reactions of interest, a hydrogen atom is transferred between two atoms, with a transition-state [A···H···B] and vibrational modes at the transition state need to be accounted for. Nevertheless, it is still generally true that cleavage of a bond with a higher vibrational frequency will give a larger isotope effect. 

To calculate the maximum possible value for a non-tunneling H KIE, we consider the case where the ZPE difference between the stretching vibrations of a C-H bond (3000 cm) and C-H bond (2200 cm) disappears in the transition state (an energy difference of [3000 – 2200 cm]/2 = 400 cm ≈ 1.15 kcal/mol), without any compensation from a ZPE difference at the transition state (e.g., from the symmetric A···H···B stretch, which is unique to the transition state). The simplified formula above, predicts a maximum for &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; as 6.9. If the complete disappearance of two bending vibrations is also included, &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; values as large as 15-20 can be predicted. Bending frequencies are very unlikely to vanish in the transition state, however, and there are only a few cases in which &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; values exceed 7-8 near room temperature. Furthermore, it is often found that tunneling is a major factor when they do exceed such values. A value of &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; ~ 10 is thought to be maximal for a semi-classical PKIE (no tunneling) for reactions at ≈298 K. (The formula for &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; has a temperature dependence, so larger isotope effects are possible at lower temperatures.) Depending on the nature of the transition state of H-transfer (symmetric vs. &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; and linear vs. bent); the extent to which a primary H isotope effect approaches this maximum, varies. A model developed by Westheimer predicted that symmetrical (thermoneutral, by Hammond&#x27;s postulate), linear transition states have the largest isotope effects, while transition states that are &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; (for exothermic or endothermic reactions, respectively), or nonlinear (e.g. cyclic) exhibit smaller effects. These predictions have since received extensive experimental support.

For secondary H isotope effects, Streitwieser proposed that weakening (or strengthening, in the case of an inverse isotope effect) of bending modes from the reactant ground state to the transition state are largely responsible for observed isotope effects. These changes are attributed to a change in steric environment when the carbon bound to the H/D undergoes rehybridization from sp to sp or vice versa (an α SKIE), or bond weakening due to hyperconjugation in cases where a carbocation is being generated one carbon atom away (a β SKIE). These isotope effects have a theoretical maximum of &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; = 2 ≈ 1.4. For a SKIE at the α position, rehybridization from sp to sp produces a normal isotope effect, while rehybridization from sp to sp results in an inverse isotope effect with a theoretical minimum of &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; = 2 ≈ 0.7. In practice, &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; ~ 1.1-1.2 and &quot;k&quot;&quot;/k&quot; ~ 0.8-0.9 are typical for α SKIEs, while &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; ~ 1.15-1.3 are typical for β SKIE. For reactants containing several isotopically substituted β-hydrogens, the observed isotope effect is often the result of several H/D&#x27;s at the β position acting in concert. In these cases, the effect of each isotopically labeled atom is multiplicative, and cases where &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; &gt; 2 are not uncommon.

The following simple expressions relating H and H KIEs, which are also known as the Swain equation (or the Swain-Schaad-Stivers equations), can be derived from the general expression given above using some simplifications:

:formula_16;

i.e.,

:formula_17.

In deriving these expressions, the reasonable approximation that reduced mass roughly equals the mass of the H, H, or H, was used. Also, the vibrational motion was assumed to be approximated by a harmonic oscillator, so that formula_18; X = H. The subscript &quot;s&quot;&quot; refers to these &quot;semi-classical&quot; KIEs, which disregard quantum tunneling. Tunneling contributions must be treated separately as a correction factor.

For isotope effects involving elements other than hydrogen, many of these simplifications are not valid, and the magnitude of the isotope effect may depend strongly on some or all of the neglected factors. Thus, KIEs for elements other than hydrogen are often much harder to rationalize or interpret. In many cases and especially for hydrogen-transfer reactions, contributions to KIEs from tunneling are significant (see below).

=== Tunneling ===
In some cases, a further rate enhancement is seen for the lighter isotope, possibly due to quantum tunneling. This is typically only observed for reactions involving bonds to hydrogen. Tunneling occurs when a molecule penetrates through a potential energy barrier rather than over it. Though not allowed by classical mechanics, particles can pass through classically forbidden regions of space in quantum mechanics based on wave–particle duality.

Tunneling can be analyzed using Bell&#x27;s modification of the Arrhenius equation, which includes the addition of a tunneling factor, Q:
:formula_19
where A is the Arrhenius parameter, E is the barrier height and
:formula_20
where formula_21 and formula_22

Examination of the &quot;β&quot; term shows exponential dependence on the particle&#x27;s mass. As a result, tunneling is much more likely for a lighter particle such as hydrogen. Simply doubling the mass of a tunneling proton by replacing it with a deuteron drastically reduces the rate of such reactions. As a result, very large KIEs are observed that can not be accounted for by differences in ZPEs.
Also, the &quot;β&quot; term depends linearly with barrier width, 2a. As with mass, tunneling is greatest for small barrier widths. Optimal tunneling distances of protons between donor and acceptor atom is 40 pm.



=== Transient kinetic isotope effect ===

Isotopic effect expressed with the equations given above only refer to reactions that can be described with first-order kinetics. In all instances in which this is not possible, transient KIEs should be taken into account using the GEBIK and GEBIF equations.

== Experiments ==

Simmons and Hartwig refer to the following three cases as the main types of KIE experiments involving C-H bond functionalization:

:A) KIE determined from absolute rates of two parallel reactions

In this experiment, the rate constants for the normal substrate and its isotopically labeled analogue are determined independently, and the KIE is obtained as a ratio of the two. The accuracy of the measured KIE is severely limited by the accuracy with which each of these rate constants can be measured. Furthermore, reproducing the exact conditions in the two parallel reactions can be very challenging. Nevertheless, a measurement of a large kinetic isotope effect through direct comparison of rate constants is indicative that C-H bond cleavage occurs at the rate-determining step. (A smaller value could indicate an isotope effect due to a pre-equilibrium, so that the C-H bond cleavage occurs somewhere before the rate-determining step.)

:B) KIE determined from an intermolecular competition

This type of experiment, uses the same substrates as used in Experiment A, but they are allowed in to react in the same container, instead of two separate containers. The KIE in this experiment is determined by the relative amount of products formed from C-H versus C-D functionalization (or it can be inferred from the relative amounts of unreacted starting materials). One must quench the reaction before it goes to completion to observe the KIE (see the Evaluation section below). Generally, the reaction is halted at low conversion (~5 to 10% conversion) or a large excess (&gt; 5 equiv.) of the isotopic mixture is used. This experiment type ensures that both C-H and C-D bond functionalizations occur under exactly the same conditions, and the ratio of products from C-H and C-D bond functionalizations can be measured with much greater precision than the rate constants in Experiment A. Moreover, only a single measurement of product concentrations from a single sample is required. However, an observed kinetic isotope effect from this experiment is more difficult to interpret, since it may either mean that C-H bond cleavage occurs during the rate-determining step or at a product-determining step ensuing the rate-determining step. The absence of a KIE, at least according to Simmons and Hartwig, is nonetheless indicative of the C-H bond cleavage not occurring during the rate-determining step.

:C) KIE determined from an intramolecular competition

This type of experiment is analogous to Experiment B, except this time there is an intramolecular competition for the C-H or C-D bond functionalization. In most cases, the substrate possesses a directing group (DG) between the C-H and C-D bonds. Calculation of the KIE from this experiment and its interpretation follow the same considerations as that of Experiment B. However, the results of Experiments B and C will differ if the irreversible binding of the isotope-containing substrate takes place in Experiment B &quot;prior&quot; to the cleavage of the C-H or C-D bond. In such a scenario, an isotope effect may be observed in Experiment C (where choice of the isotope can take place even after substrate binding) but not in Experiment B (since the choice of whether C-H or C-D bond cleaves is already made as soon as the substrate binds irreversibly). In contrast to Experiment B, the reaction need not be halted at low consumption of isotopic starting material to obtain an accurate &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot;, since the ratio of H and D in the starting material is 1:1, regardless of the extent of conversion.

One non-C-H activation example of different isotope effects being observed in the case of intermolecular (Experiment B) and intramolecular (Experiment C) competition is the photolysis of diphenyldiazomethane in the presence of &quot;t&quot;-butylamine. To explain this result, the formation of diphenylcarbene, followed by irreversible nucleophilic attack by &quot;t&quot;-butylamine was proposed. Because there is little isotopic difference in the rate of nucleophilic attack, the intermolecular experiment resulted in a KIE close to 1. In the intramolecular case, however, the product ratio is determined by the proton transfer that occurs after the nucleophilic attack, a process which has a substantial KIE of 2.6.

Thus, Experiments A, B, and C will give results of differing levels of precision and require different experimental setup and ways of analyzing data. As a result, the feasibility of each type of experiment depends on the kinetic and stoichiometric profile of the reaction, as well as the physical characteristics of the reaction mixture (e.g. homogeneous vs. heterogeneous). Moreover, as noted in the paragraph above, the experiments provide KIE data for different steps of a multi-step reaction, depending on the relative locations of the rate-limiting step, product-determining steps, and/or C-H/D cleavage step.

The hypothetical examples below illustrate common scenarios. Consider the following reaction coordinate diagram. For a reaction with this profile, all three experiments (A, B, and C) will yield a significant primary KIE:

On the other hand, if a reaction follows the following energy profile, in which the C-H or C-D bond cleavage is irreversible but occurs after the rate-determining step (RDS), no significant KIE will be observed with Experiment A, since the overall rate is not affected by the isotopic substitution. Nevertheless, the irreversible C-H bond cleavage step will give a primary KIE with the other two experiments, since the second step would still affect the product distribution. Therefore, with Experiments B and C, it is possible to observe the KIE even if C-H or C-D bond cleavage occurs not in the rate-determining step, but in the product-determining step.


=== Evaluation of rate constant ratios from intermolecular competition reactions ===
In competition reactions, KIE is calculated from isotopic product or remaining reactant ratios after the reaction, but these ratios depend strongly on the extent of completion of the reaction. Most often, the isotopic substrate consists of molecules labeled in a specific position and their unlabeled, ordinary counterparts. One can also, in case of C KIEs, as well as similar cases, simply rely on the natural abundance of the isotopic carbon for the KIE experiments, eliminating the need for isotopic labeling.
The two isotopic substrates will react through the same mechanism, but at different rates. The ratio between the amounts of the two species in the reactants and the products will thus change gradually over the course of the reaction, and this gradual change can be treated as follows: Assume that two isotopic molecules, A and A, undergo irreversible competition reactions:
:formula_23
The KIE for this scenario is found to be:

:formula_24

Where F and F refer to the fraction of conversions for the isotopic species A and A, respectively.

 = \ce{\frac {[A2]/[A2]^0}{[A1]/[A1]^0}} = \frac{1-F_2}{1-F_1}=(1-F_1)^{(k_2/k_1)-1}&lt;/math&gt;

This relation can be solved in terms of the KIE to obtain the KIE expression given above. When the uncommon isotope has very low abundance, both R and R are very small and not significantly different from each other, such that 1-&quot;F&quot; can be approximated with &quot;m&quot;/&quot;m&quot; or &quot;c&quot;/&quot;c&quot;.

Isotopic enrichment of the starting material can be calculated from the dependence of &quot;R/R&quot; on &quot;F&quot; for various KIEs, yielding the following figure. Due to the exponential dependence, even very low KIEs lead to large changes in isotopic composition of the starting material at high conversions.

When the products are followed, the KIE can be calculated using the products ratio &quot;R&quot; along with &quot;R&quot; as follows:

:formula_25

=== Kinetic isotope effect measurement at natural abundance ===
KIE measurement at natural abundance is a simple general method for measuring KIEs for chemical reactions performed with materials of natural abundance. This technique for measuring KIEs overcomes many limitations of previous KIE measurement methods. KIE measurements from isotopically labeled materials require a new synthesis for each isotopically labeled material (a process often prohibitively difficult), a competition reaction, and an analysis. The KIE measurement at natural abundance avoids these issues by taking advantage of high precision quantitative techniques (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isotope-ratio mass spectrometry) to site selectively measure kinetic fractionation of isotopes, in either product or starting material for a given chemical reaction.

==== Single-pulse NMR ====
Quantitative single-pulse nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a method amenable for measuring kinetic fractionation of isotopes for natural abundance KIE measurements. Pascal et al. were inspired by studies demonstrating dramatic variations of deuterium within identical compounds from different sources and hypothesized that NMR could be used to measure H KIEs at natural abundance. Pascal and coworkers tested their hypothesis by studying the insertion reaction of dimethyl diazomalonate into cyclohexane. Pascal et al. measured a KIE of 2.2 using H NMR for materials of natural abundance.

Singleton and coworkers demonstrated the capacity of C NMR based natural abundance KIE measurements for studying the mechanism of the [4 + 2] cycloaddition of isoprene with maleic anhydride. Previous studies by Gajewski on isotopically enrich materials observed KIE results that suggested an asynchronous transition state, but were always consistent, within error, for a perfectly synchronous reaction mechanism.

This work by Singleton et al. established the measurement of multiple C KIEs within the design of a single experiment. These H and C KIE measurements determined at natural abundance found the &quot;inside&quot; hydrogens of the diene experience a more pronounced H KIE than the &quot;outside&quot; hydrogens and the C1 and C4 experience a significant KIE. These key observations suggest an asynchronous reaction mechanism for the cycloaddition of isoprene with maleic anhydride.

The limitations for determining KIEs at natural abundance using NMR are that the recovered material must have a suitable amount and purity for NMR analysis (the signal of interest should be distinct from other signals), the reaction of interest must be irreversible, and the reaction mechanism must not change for the duration of the chemical reaction.

Experimental details for using quantitative single pulse NMR to measure KIE at natural abundance as follows: the experiment needs to be performed under quantitative conditions including a relaxation time of 5 T, measured 90° flip angle, a digital resolution of at least 5 points across a peak, and a signal:noise greater than 250. The raw FID is zero-filled to at least 256K points before the Fourier transform. NMR spectra are phased and then treated with a zeroth order baseline correction without any tilt correction. Signal integrations are determined numerically with a minimal tolerance for each integrated signal.

==== Organometallic reaction mechanism elucidation examples ====
Colletto et al. developed a regioselective β-arylation of benzo[b]thiophenes at room temperature with aryl iodides as coupling partners and sought to understand the mechanism of this reaction by performing natural abundance KIE measurements via single pulse NMR.


The observation of a primary C isotope effect at C3, an inverse H isotope effect, a secondary C isotope effect at C2, and the lack of a H isotope effect at C2; led Colletto &quot;et al.&quot; to suggest a Heck-type reaction mechanism for the regioselective -arylation of benzo[b]thiophenes at room temperature with aryl iodides as coupling partners.

Frost &quot;et al.&quot; sought to understand the effects of Lewis acid additives on the mechanism of enantioselective palladium-catalyzed C-N bond activation using natural abundance KIE measurements via single pulse NMR.
The primary C KIE observed in the absence of BPh suggests a reaction mechanism with rate limiting cis oxidation into the C–CN bond of the cyanoformamide. The addition of BPh causes a relative decrease in the observed C KIE which led Frost et al. to suggest a change in the rate limiting step from cis oxidation to coordination of palladium to the cyanoformamide.

==== DEPT-55 NMR ====
Though KIE measurements at natural abundance are a powerful tool for understanding reaction mechanisms, the amounts of material needed for analysis can make this technique inaccessible for reactions that use expensive reagents or unstable starting materials. To mitigate these limitations, Jacobsen and coworkers developed H to C polarization transfer as a means to reduce the time and material required for KIE measurements at natural abundance. The distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) takes advantage of the larger gyromagnetic ratio of H over C, to theoretically improve measurement sensitivity by a factor of 4 or decrease experiment time by a factor of 16. This method for natural abundance kinetic isotope measurement is favorable for analysis for reactions containing unstable starting materials, and catalysts or products that are relatively costly.

Jacobsen and coworkers identified the thiourea-catalyzed glycosylation of galactose as a reaction that met both of the aforementioned criteria (expensive materials and unstable substrates) and was a reaction with a poorly understood mechanism. Glycosylation is a special case of nucleophilic substitution that lacks clear definition between S1 and S2 mechanistic character. The presence of the oxygen adjacent to the site of displacement (i.e., C1) can stabilize positive charge. This charge stabilization can cause any potential concerted pathway to become asynchronous and approaches intermediates with oxocarbenium character of the S1 mechanism for glycosylation.


Jacobsen and coworkers observed small normal KIEs at C1, C2, and C5 which suggests significant oxocarbenium character in the transition state and an asynchronous reaction mechanism with a large degree of charge separation.

==== Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry ====

High precision isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is another method for measuring kinetic fractionation of isotopes for natural abundance KIE measurements. Widlanski and coworkers demonstrated S KIE at natural abundance measurements for the hydrolysis of sulfate monoesters. Their observation of a large KIE suggests S-O bond cleavage is rate controlling and likely rules out an associate reaction mechanism.
The major limitation for determining KIEs at natural abundance using IRMS is the required site selective degradation without isotopic fractionation into an analyzable small molecule, a non-trivial task.

== Case studies ==

=== Primary hydrogen isotope effects ===
Primary hydrogen KIEs refer to cases in which a bond to the isotopically labeled hydrogen is formed or broken at a rate- and/or product-determining step of a reaction. These are the most commonly measured KIEs, and much of the previously covered theory refers to primary KIEs. When there is adequate evidence that transfer of the labeled hydrogen occurs in the rate-determining step of a reaction, if a fairly large KIE is observed, e.g. k/k of at least 5-6 or k/k about 10–13 at room temperature, it is quite likely that the hydrogen transfer is linear and that the hydrogen is fairly symmetrically located in the transition state. It is usually not possible to make comments about tunneling contributions to the observed isotope effect unless the effect is very large. If the primary KIE is not as large, it is generally considered to be indicative of a significant contribution from heavy-atom motion to the reaction coordinate, though it may also mean that hydrogen transfer follows a nonlinear pathway.

=== Secondary hydrogen isotope effects ===
Secondary hydrogen isotope effects or secondary KIE (SKIE) arise in cases where the isotopic substitution is remote from the bond being broken. The remote atom nonetheless influences the internal vibrations of the system, which via changes in zero-point energy (ZPE) affect the rates of chemical reactions. Such effects are expressed as ratios of rate for the light isotope to that of the heavy isotope and can be &quot;normal&quot; (ratio ≥ 1) or &quot;inverse&quot; (ratio &lt; 1) effects. SKIEs are defined as &quot;α,β&quot; (etc.) secondary isotope effects where such prefixes refer to the position of the isotopic substitution relative to the reaction center (see alpha and beta carbon). The prefix &quot;α&quot; refers to the isotope associated with the reaction center and the prefix &quot;β&quot; refers to the isotope associated with an atom neighboring the reaction center and so on.

In physical organic chemistry, SKIE is discussed in terms of electronic effects such as induction, bond hybridization, or hyperconjugation. These properties are determined by electron distribution, and depend upon vibrationally averaged bond length and angles that are not greatly affected by isotopic substitution. Thus, the use of the term &quot;electronic isotope effect&quot; while legitimate is discouraged from use as it can be misinterpreted to suggest that the isotope effect is electronic in nature rather than vibrational.

SKIEs can be explained in terms of changes in orbital hybridization. When the hybridization of a carbon atom changes from sp to sp, a number of vibrational modes (stretches, in-plane and out-of-plane bending) are affected. The in-plane and out-of-plane bending in an sp hybridized carbon are similar in frequency due to the symmetry of an sp hybridized carbon. In an sp hybridized carbon the in-plane bend is much stiffer than the out-of-plane bending resulting in a large difference in the frequency, the ZPE and thus the SKIE (which exists when there is a difference in the ZPE of the reactant and transition state).
The theoretical maximum change caused by the bending frequency difference has been calculated as 1.4.

When carbon undergoes a reaction that changes its hybridization from sp to sp, the out-of-plane bending force constant at the transition state is weaker as it is developing sp character and a &quot;normal&quot; SKIE is observed with typical values of 1.1 to 1.2. Conversely, when carbon&#x27;s hybridization changes from sp to sp, the out of plane bending force constants at the transition state increase and an inverse SKIE is observed with typical values of 0.8 to 0.9.

More generally the SKIE for reversible reactions can be &quot;normal&quot; one way and &quot;inverse&quot; the other if bonding in the transition state is midway in stiffness between substrate and product, or they can be &quot;normal&quot; both ways if bonding is weaker in the transition state, or &quot;inverse&quot; both ways if bonding is stronger in the transition state than in either reactant.

An example of an &quot;inverse&quot; α SKIE can be seen in the work of Fitzpatrick and Kurtz who used such an effect to distinguish between two proposed pathways for the reaction of d-amino acid oxidase with nitroalkane anions. Path A involved a nucleophilic attack on the coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), while path B involves a free-radical intermediate. As path A results in the intermediate carbon changing hybridization from sp to sp an &quot;inverse&quot; SKIE is expected. If path B occurs then no SKIE should be observed as the free radical intermediate does not change hybridization. An SKIE of 0.84 was observed and Path A verified as shown in the scheme below.

Another example of SKIE is oxidation of benzyl alcohols by dimethyldioxirane, where three transition states for different mechanisms were proposed. Again, by considering how and if the hydrogen atoms were involved in each, researchers predicted whether or not they would expect an effect of isotopic substitution of them. Then, analysis of the experimental data for the reaction allowed them to choose which pathway was most likely based on the observed isotope effect.

Secondary hydrogen isotope effects from the methylene hydrogens were also used to show that Cope rearrangement in 1,5-hexadiene follow a concerted bond rearrangement pathway, and not one of the alternatively proposed allyl radical or 1,4-diyl pathways, all of which are presented in the following scheme.

Alternative mechanisms for the Cope rearrangement of 1,5-hexadiene: (from top to bottom), allyl radical, synchronous concerted, and 1,4-dyil pathways. The predominant pathway is found to be the middle one, which has six delocalized π electrons corresponding to an aromatic intermediate.

==== Steric isotope effects ====

The steric isotope effect (SIE) is a SKIE that does not involve bond breaking or formation. This effect is attributed to the different vibrational amplitudes of isotopologues. An example of such an effect is the racemization of 9,10-dihydro-4,5-dimethylphenanthrene. The smaller amplitude of vibration for H than for H in C–H, C–H bonds, results in a smaller van der Waals radius or effective size in addition to a difference in the ZPE between the two. When there is a greater effective bulk of molecules containing one over the other this may be manifested by a steric effect on the rate constant. For the example above, H racemizes faster than H resulting in a SIE. A model for the SIE was developed by Bartell. A SIE is usually small, unless the transformations passes through a transition state with severe steric encumbrance, as in the racemization process shown above.

Another example of the SIE is in the deslipping reaction of rotaxanes. H, due to its smaller effective size, allows easier passage of the stoppers through the macrocycle, resulting in faster deslipping for the deuterated rotaxanes.

=== Inverse kinetic isotope effects ===
Reactions are known where the deuterated species reacts &quot;faster&quot; than the undeuterated one, and these cases are said to exhibit inverse KIEs (IKIE). IKIEs are often observed in the reductive elimination of alkyl metal hydrides, e.g. ((MeNCH))PtMe(H). In such cases the C-D bond in the transition state, an agostic species, is highly stabilized relative to the C–H bond.

An inverse effect can also occur in a multistep reaction if the overall rate constant depends on a pre-equilibrium prior to the rate-determining step which has an inverse equilibrium isotope effect. For example, the rates of acid-catalyzed reactions are usually 2-3 times greater for reactions in DO catalyzed by DO than for the analogous reactions in HO catalyzed by HO This can be explained for a mechanism of specific hydrogen-ion catalysis of a reactant R by HO (or DO).
:HO + R RH + HO
:RH + HO → HO + P
The rate of formation of products is then d[P]/dt = k[RH] = kK[HO][R] = k[HO][R]. In the first step, HO is usually a stronger acid than RH. Deuteration shifts the equilibrium toward the more strongly bound acid species RD in which the effect of deuteration on zero-point vibrational energy is greater, so that the deuterated equilibrium constant K is greater than K. This equilibrium isotope effect in the first step usually outweighs the kinetic isotope effect in the second step, so that there is an apparent inverse isotope effect and the observed overall rate constant k = kK decreases.

=== Solvent hydrogen kinetic isotope effects ===

For the solvent isotope effects to be measurable, a fraction of the solvent must have a different isotopic composition than the rest. Therefore, large amounts of the less common isotopic species must be available, limiting observable solvent isotope effects to isotopic substitutions involving hydrogen. Detectable KIEs occur only when solutes exchange hydrogen with the solvent or when there is a specific solute-solvent interaction near the reaction site. Both such phenomena are common for protic solvents, in which the hydrogen is exchangeable, and they may form dipole-dipole interactions or hydrogen bonds with polar molecules.

=== Carbon-13 isotope effects ===
Most organic reactions involve breaking and making bonds to carbon; thus, it is reasonable to expect detectable carbon isotope effects. When C is used as the label, the change in mass of the isotope is only ~8%, though, which limits the observable KIEs to much smaller values than the ones observable with hydrogen isotope effects.

==== Compensating for variations in C natural abundance ====
Often, the largest source of error in a study that depends on the natural abundance of carbon is the slight variation in natural C abundance itself. Such variations arise; because the starting materials in the reaction, are themselves products of other reactions that have KIEs and thus isotopically enrich the products. To compensate for this error when NMR spectroscopy is used to determine the KIE, the following guidelines have been proposed:
* Choose a carbon that is remote from the reaction center that will serve as a reference and assume it does not have a KIE in the reaction.
* In the starting material that has not undergone any reaction, determine the ratios of the other carbon NMR peak integrals to that of the reference carbon.
* Obtain the same ratios for the carbons in a sample of the starting material after it has undergone some reaction.
* The ratios of the latter ratios to the former ratios yields R/R.
If these as well as some other precautions listed by Jankowski are followed, KIEs with precisions of three decimal places can be achieved.

=== Isotope effects with elements heavier than carbon ===
Interpretation of carbon isotope effects is usually complicated by simultaneously forming and breaking bonds to carbon. Even reactions that involve only bond cleavage from the carbon, such as S1 reactions, involve strengthening of the remaining bonds to carbon. In many such reactions, leaving group isotope effects tend to be easier to interpret. For example, substitution and elimination reactions in which chlorine acts as a leaving group are convenient to interpret, especially since chlorine acts as a monatomic species with no internal bonding to complicate the reaction coordinate, and it has two stable isotopes, Cl and Cl, both with high abundance. The major challenge to the interpretation of such isotope affects is the solvation of the leaving group.

Owing to experimental uncertainties, measurement of isotope effect may entail significant uncertainty. Often isotope effects are determined through complementary studies on a series of isotopomers. Accordingly, it is quite useful to combine hydrogen isotope effects with heavy-atom isotope effects. For instance, determining nitrogen isotope effect along with hydrogen isotope effect was used to show that the reaction of 2-phenylethyltrimethylammonium ion with ethoxide in ethanol at 40°C follows an E2 mechanism, as opposed to alternative non-concerted mechanisms. This conclusion was reached upon showing that this reaction yields a nitrogen isotope effect, &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot;, of 1.0133±0.0002 along with a hydrogen KIE of 3.2 at the leaving hydrogen.

Similarly, combining nitrogen and hydrogen isotope effects was used to show that syn eliminations of simple ammonium salts also follow a concerted mechanism, which was a question of debate before. In the following two reactions of 2-phenylcyclopentyltrimethylammonium ion with ethoxide, both of which yield 1-phenylcyclopentene, both isomers exhibited a nitrogen isotope effect &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot; at 60°C. Though the reaction of the trans isomer, which follows syn elimination, has a smaller nitrogen KIE (1.0064) than the cis isomer which undergoes anti elimination (1.0108); both results are large enough to be indicative of weakening of the C-N bond in the transition state that would occur in a concerted process.
=== Other examples ===
Since KIEs arise from differences in isotopic mass, the largest observable KIEs are associated with substitution of H with H (2× increase in mass) or H (3× increase in mass). KIEs from isotopic mass ratios can be as large as 36.4 using muons. They have produced the lightest &quot;hydrogen&quot; atom, H (0.113 amu), in which an electron orbits a positive muon (μ) &quot;nucleus&quot; that has a mass of 206 electrons. They have also prepared the heaviest &quot;hydrogen&quot; atom by replacing one electron in helium with a negative muon μ to form Heμ (mass 4.116 amu). Since μ is much heavier than an electron, it orbits much closer to the nucleus, effectively shielding one proton, making Heμ behave as H. With these exotic atoms, the reaction of H with H was investigated. Rate constants from reacting the lightest and the heaviest hydrogen analogs with H were then used to calculate &quot;k&quot;/&quot;k&quot;, in which there is a 36.4× difference in isotopic mass. For this reaction, isotopic substitution happens to produce an IKIE, and the authors report a KIE as low as 1.74×10, the smallest KIE ever reported.

The KIE leads to a specific distribution of H in natural products, depending on the route they were synthesized in nature. By NMR spectroscopy, it is therefore easy to detect whether the alcohol in wine was fermented from glucose, or from illicitly added saccharose.

Another reaction mechanism that was elucidated using the KIE is halogenation of toluene:

In this particular &quot;intramolecular KIE&quot; study, a benzylic hydrogen undergoes radical substitution by bromine using &quot;N&quot;-bromosuccinimide as the brominating agent. It was found that PhCH brominates 4.86x faster than PhCH (PhCD). A large KIE of 5.56 is associated with the reaction of ketones with bromine and sodium hydroxide.

In this reaction the rate-limiting step is formation of the enolate by deprotonation of the ketone. In this study the KIE is calculated from the reaction rate constants for regular 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanone and its deuterated isomer by optical density measurements.

In asymmetric catalysis, there are rare cases where a KIE manifests as a significant difference in the enantioselectivity observed for a deuterated substrate compared to a non-deuterated one. One example was reported by Toste and coworkers, in which a deuterated substrate produced an enantioselectivity of 83% ee, compared to 93% ee for the undeuterated substrate. The effect was taken to corroborate additional inter- and intramolecular competition KIE data that suggested cleavage of the C-H/D bond in the enantiodetermining step.

<doc id="1106775" wikidata="Q579026" url="?curid=1106775" title="The Golden Cockerel">
<text>The Golden Cockerel ( ) is an opera in three acts, with a short prologue and an even shorter epilogue, composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, his last complete opera, before his death in 1908. Its libretto written by Vladimir Belsky, is derived from Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s 1834 poem, &quot;The Tale of the Golden Cockerel&quot;. The opera was completed in 1907, and premiered in 1909, in Moscow, after the composer&#x27;s death. Apart from Russia, it has often been performed in French, as &quot;Le coq d&#x27;or&quot;.

==Composition history==
Rimsky-Korsakov had considered his previous opera, &quot;The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya&quot; (1907) to be his final artistic statement in the medium, and, indeed, this work has been called a &quot;summation of the nationalistic operatic tradition of Glinka and The Five.&quot; However, the political situation in Russia at the time inspired him to take up the pen to compose a &quot;razor-sharp satire of the autocracy, of Russian imperialism, and of the Russo-Japanese war.&quot; Also, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s previous works inspired by Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s poems, especially &quot;Tsar Saltan&quot; (1899-1900), had proven to be very successful.

The work on &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; began in 1906, and finished by September, 1907. By the end of February 1908, the director of Imperial Theatres, Vladimir Telyakovskiy passed the score to the censorship agency in order to get an approval for the Bolshoi Theatre. It was returned unedited, yet suddenly taken back the next day. This time many changes were requested to be made to the libretto as well as the original Pushkin&#x27;s text. Rimsky-Korsakov suspected someone&#x27;s denunciation and resisted any changes. He continued the work on orchestration while fighting with progressive illness. In June 1908, Telyakovskiy informed him that the Moscow Governor-General Sergei Gershelman was highly against the opera. In his last letter Rimsky-Korsakov asked his friend and music publisher Boris Jurgenson, to contact Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi and suggest him to stage &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; in Paris. He died two days later and thus never witnessed the premiere of his last opera.

==Performance history==
The premiere took place on 7 October, (O.S. 24 September) 1909, at Moscow&#x27;s Solodovnikov Theatre in a performance by the Zimin Opera. Emil Cooper conducted; set designs were by Ivan Bilibin. The opera was given at the city&#x27;s Bolshoi Theatre a month later, on 6 November, conducted by Vyacheslav Suk and with set designs by Konstantin Korovin. London and Paris premieres occurred in 1914; in Paris it was staged at the Palais Garnier, in London at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane by the Ballets Russes as an opera-ballet, choreographed and directed by Michel Fokine with set and costume designs by Natalia Goncharova. The United States premiere took place at the Metropolitan Opera House on 6 March 1918, with Marie Sundelius in the title role, Adamo Didur and Maria Barrientos in the actual leads, and Pierre Monteux conducting.

The Met performed the work regularly through 1945. All Met performances before World War II were sung in French; during the work&#x27;s final season in the Met repertory, the &quot;Golden Cockerel&quot; was sung in English. The English translators were Antal Doráti and James Gibson. The work has not been performed at the Met since the war, but it was staged at neighboring New York City Opera from 1967 to 1971, always in English, with Beverly Sills singing the Tsaritsa of Shemakha opposite Norman Treigle&#x27;s Dodon, and Julius Rudel conducting Tito Capobianco&#x27;s production.

At Covent Garden in London the opera was seen in January 1954, in a production by Robert Helpmann conducted by Igor Markevitch (making his Covent Garden debut); the cast included Hugues Cuénod as the astrologer, Howell Glynne as Dodon, and Mattiwilda Dobbs as the Queen of Shemakhan. In 1998, the Royal Opera company presented a new production at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre produced by Tim Hopkins and conducted by Vladimir Jurowski with Jean-Paul Fouchécourt as the astrologer, Paata Burchuladze as Dodon and Elena Kelessidi as the Queen.

On 13 December 1975, the BBC broadcast a live performance in English from the Theatre Royal Glasgow of a production by David Pountney with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Alexander Gibson, and with Don Garrard as Tsar Dodon, John Angelo Messana as the Astrologer and Catherine Gayer as the Tsaritsa.

The Mariinsky Theatre staged a new production of &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; on 25 December 2014, with Valery Gergiev as conductor. The stage director and costume designer was Anna Matison. The opera was presented in Russian during the 2015 winter season by the Sarasota Opera conducted by Ekhart Wycik, with set designs by David P. Gordon, and featuring Grigory Soloviov as Tsar Dodon, Alexandra Batsios as the Tsaritsa of Shemakha, Timur Bekbosunov at the Astrologer, and Riley Svatos as the Golden Cockerel.

De Munt/La Monnaie staged a new production in Brussels in December 2016. This was a co-production with the Teatro Real of Madrid and Opera National de Lorraine (Nancy). The stage director and costume designer was Laurent Pelly; the conductor, Alain Altinoglu. The role of Tsar Dodon was shared between Pavol Hunka and Alexey Tikhomirov; the Tsarina shared between Venera Gimadieva and Nina Minasyan. Alexander Kravets took the role of Astrologer and the singing role of the Cockerel was played by Sheva Tehoval with Sarah Demarthe as the on-stage Cockerel.

==Roles==
&quot;Note on names&quot;:
*Pushkin spelled Dodon&#x27;s name as &quot;Dadon&quot;. The association of the revised spelling &quot;Dodon&quot; in the libretto with the dodo bird is likely intentional.
*&quot;Shemakha&quot; is a noun, denoting a place. &quot;Shemakhan&quot; is an adjectival usage.

==Synopsis==
: &quot;Time&quot;: Unspecified
: &quot;Place&quot;: In the thrice-tenth tsardom, a far off place (beyond thrice-nine lands) in Russian folklore

&quot;Note&quot;: There is an actual city of Shemakha (also spelled &quot;Şamaxı&quot;, &quot;Schemacha&quot; and &quot;Shamakhy&quot;), which is the capital of the Shamakhi Rayon of Azerbaijan. In Pushkin&#x27;s day it was an important city and capital of what was to become the Baku Governorate. But the realm of that name, ruled by its tsaritsa, bears little resemblance to today&#x27;s Shemakha and region.

===Prologue===
After quotation by the orchestra of the most important leitmotifs, a mysterious Astrologer comes before the curtain and announces to the audience that, although they are going to see and hear a fictional tale from long ago, his story will have a valid and true moral.

===Act 1===
The bumbling Tsar Dodon talks himself into believing that his country is in danger from a neighbouring state, Shemakha, ruled by a beautiful Tsaritsa. He requests advice of the Astrologer, who supplies a magic Golden Cockerel to safeguard the Tsar&#x27;s interests. When the little cockerel confirms that the Tsaritsa of Shemakha does harbor territorial ambitions, Dodon decides to preemptively strike Shemakha, sending his army to battle under the command of his two sons.

===Act 2===

However, his sons are both so inept that they manage to kill each other on the battlefield. Tsar Dodon then decides to lead the army himself, but further bloodshed is averted because the Golden Cockerel ensures that the old Tsar becomes besotted when he actually sees the beautiful Tsaritsa. The Tsaritsa herself encourages this situation by performing a seductive dance – which tempts the Tsar to try and partner her, but he is clumsy and makes a complete mess of it. The Tsaritsa realises that she can take over Dodon&#x27;s country without further fighting – she engineers a marriage proposal from Dodon, which she coyly accepts.

===Act 3===
The Final Scene starts with the wedding procession in all its splendour. As this reaches its conclusion, the Astrologer appears and says to Dodon, “You promised me anything I could ask for if there could be a happy resolution of your troubles ... .” “Yes, yes,” replies the Tsar, “just name it and you shall have it.” “Right,” says the Astrologer, “I want the Tsaritsa of Shemakha!” At this, the Tsar flares up in fury, and strikes down the Astrologer with a blow from his mace. The Golden Cockerel, loyal to his Astrologer master, then swoops across and pecks through the Tsar&#x27;s jugular. The sky darkens. When light returns, the Tsaritsa and the little cockerel are gone.

===Epilogue===
The Astrologer comes again before the curtain and announces the end of his story, reminding the public that what they just saw was “merely illusion,” that only he and the Tsaritsa were mortals and real.

==Analysis==
Preface to &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; by librettist V. Belsky (1907)

:The purely human character of Pushkin&#x27;s story, The Golden Cockerel – a tragi-comedy showing the fatal results of human passion and weakness – allows us to place the plot in any surroundings and in any period. On these points the author does not commit himself, but indicates vaguely in the manner of fairy-tales: &quot;In a certain far-off tsardom&quot;, &quot;in a country set on the borders of the world&quot;... Nevertheless, the name Dodon and certain details and expressions used in the story prove the poet&#x27;s desire to give his work the air of a popular Russian fairy tale (like Tsar Saltan), and similar to those fables expounding the deeds of Prince Bova, of Jerouslan Lazarevitch or Erhsa Stchetinnik, fantastical pictures of national habit and costumes. Therefore, in spite of Oriental traces and the Italian names Duodo and Guidone, the tale is intended to depict, historically, the simple manners and daily life of the Russian people, painted in primitive colours with all the freedom and extravagance beloved of artists.

:In producing the opera the greatest attention must be paid to every scenic detail, so as not to spoil the special character of the work. The following remark is equally important. In spite of its apparent simplicity, the purpose of The Golden Cockerel is undoubtedly symbolic.

:This is not to be gathered so much from the famous couplet: &quot;Tho&#x27; a fable, I admit, moral can be drawn to fit!&quot; which emphasises the general message of the story, as from the way in which Pushkin has shrouded in mystery the relationship between his two fantastical characters: The Astrologer and the Tsaritsa.

:Did they hatch a plot against Dodon? Did they meet by accident, both intent on the tsar&#x27;s downfall? The author does not tell us, and yet this is a question to be solved in order to determine the interpretation of the work. The principal charm of the story lies in so much being left to the imagination, but, in order to render the plot somewhat clearer, a few words as to the action on the stage may not come amiss.

:Many centuries ago, a wizard, still alive today, sought by his magic cunning to overcome the daughter of the Aerial Powers. Failing in his project, he tried to win her through the person of Tsar Dodon. He is unsuccessful and to console himself, he presents to the audience, in his magic lantern the story of heartless royal ingratitude.

==Performance practice==

Composer&#x27;s performance remarks (1907)

#The composer does not sanction any &quot;cuts.&quot;
#Operatic singers are in the habit of introducing interjections, spoken words, etc. into the music, hoping thereby to produce dramatic, comic or realistic effect. Far from adding significance to the music, these additions and emendations merely disfigure it. The composer desires that the singers in all his works keep strictly to the music written for them.
#Metronome marks must be followed accurately. This does not imply that artists should sing like clock-work, they are given full artistic scope, but they must keep within bounds.
#The composer feels it necessary to reiterate the following remark in lyrical passages, those actors who are on the stage, but not singing at the moment, must refrain from drawing the attention of the spectators to themselves by unnecessary by-play. An opera is first and foremost a musical work.
#The part of the Astrologer is written for a voice seldom met with, that of tenor altino. It may however be entrusted to a lyric tenor possessing a strong falsetto, for the part is written in the extremely high register.
#The Golden Cockerel demands a strong soprano or high mezzo-soprano voice.
#The dances performed by the Tsar and Tsaritsa in the second act, must be carried out so as not to interfere with the singers breathing by too sudden or too violent movement.

Staging practices

Early stagings became influential by stressing the modernist elements inherent in the opera. Diaghilev&#x27;s 1914 Paris production had the singers sitting offstage, while dancers provided the stage action. Though some in Russia disapproved of Diaghilev&#x27;s interpretation, and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s widow threatened to sue, the production was considered a milestone. Stravinsky was to expand on this idea in the staging of his own &quot;Renard&quot; (1917) and &quot;Les Noces&quot; (1923), in which the singers are unseen, and mimes or dancers perform on stage.

==Derived works==
Rimsky-Korsakov made the following concert arrangement:
*Introduction and Wedding Procession from the opera &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; (1907)
:Введение и свадебное шествие из оперы «Золотой петушок»

After his death, A. Glazunov and M. Shteynberg (Steinberg) compiled the following orchestral suite:
*Four Musical Pictures from the Opera &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;
:Четыре музыкальных картины из оперы «Золотой петушок»
#Tsar Dodon at home (Царь Додон у себя дома)
#Tsar Dodon on the march (Царь Додон в походе)
#Tsar Dodon with the Shemakhan Tsaritsa (Царь Додон у Шемаханской царицы)
#The wedding and the lamentable end of Dodon (Свадьба и печальный конец Додона)

Efrem Zimbalist wrote &quot;Concert Phantasy on &#x27;Le coq d&#x27;or&quot;&#x27; for violin and piano based on themes from the suite.

==Inspiration for other works==

Marina Frolova-Walker points to &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; as the fore-runner of the anti-psychologistic and absurdist ideas which would culminate in such 20th century &#x27;anti-operas&#x27; as Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; (1921) and Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;The Nose&quot; (1930). In this, his last opera, Rimsky-Korsakov had laid &quot;the foundation for modernist opera in Russia and beyond.&quot;

In 1978–79 the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote &quot;&quot;Il gallo d’oro&quot; da Rimsky-Korsakov: variazioni frivole con una fuga anarchica, eretica e perversa&quot;.

<text>Morgan Brittany (born Suzanne Cupito; December 5, 1951) is an American actress. She began her career as a child appearing in films &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962), &quot;Stage to Thunder Rock&quot; (1964) and &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;. In 1970s, Brittany began work as a model joining Ford Models. She played Vivien Leigh in films &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975), &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot; (1980). Brittany is best-known for portraying Katherine Wentworth, the scheming younger half-sister of Pamela Ewing and Cliff Barnes, on the primetime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; (1981–1985, 1987).

==Career==

===Early child career===
Los Angeles–born Suzanne Cupito began her acting career as a child under her real name. She appeared on many programs in the 1950s and 1960s, beginning at age five in a 1957 episode of the CBS television network anthology series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (or at that same age in an episode of &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;). In January 1960, Cupito displayed her talent as a ballet dancer on &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;. Three months later, she followed that up with her first of three &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes, appearing as a little girl in &quot;Nightmare as a Child&quot;, for which she remained uncredited on-screen despite having dialogue. Cupito also portrayed Sissy Johnson in the season-four episode &quot;Valley of the Shadow&quot; and the vicious brat Susan in the season-five episode &quot;Caesar and Me&quot; (as Susanne Cupito). 

Cupito was featured in the musical film &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962), as Baby June. She appeared in the episode &quot;Daughter for a Day&quot; on ABC&#x27;s &quot;My Three Sons&quot; (1962) as Jeannie Hill. Cupito appeared in the episode &quot;Daddy Went Away&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (May 11, 1963) as Jessica Damon. She appeared uncredited in the birthday party and schoolhouse scenes in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963).

In 1963, Cupito played Winter Night in the episode &quot;Incident of the Hostages&quot; of &quot;Rawhide&quot;. In 1964, she starred as a blind girl named Minerva Gordon in a two-part episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Inheritors&quot;, and appeared in the Western film &quot;Stage to Thunder Rock&quot;. 

In 1966, Cupito appeared in the series finale of the Western &quot;Branded&quot;, playing an orphan named Kellie in the episode of the same name. She was part of the ensemble cast in the film &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (1968), which is led by Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda. Cupito also appeared in the season-eight premiere episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; titled &quot;Opie&#x27;s First Love&quot; as Mary Alice.

Cupito appeared in two episodes of &quot;Lassie&quot;, &quot;Lassie and the Swamp Girl&quot; and &quot;Little Dog Lost&quot; as Mattie in the mid-1960s. She followed that up with appearances on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and other shows. At the age of 15, after appearing in &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;, Cupito&#x27;s childhood career came to an end and she concentrated on getting her education at Cleveland High School, Reseda, California.

===Adult career===
At age 18, Cupito changed her name to Morgan Brittany and then appeared with Gene Kelly in his Las Vegas show, &quot;Gene Kelly&#x27;s Wonderful World of Girls&quot;, as a dancer. She then moved to New York City, where she modeled for the Ford modeling agency, and appeared in several TV commercials and print ads (including a three-year stint as &quot;The Ultra Brite Toothpaste Girl&quot;), and was spokesmodel for brands such as L&#x27;Oreal, Maybelline, Ford, Levi&#x27;s, and Camay. In December 1972, she played Cynthia, a childhood friend of Bridget&#x27;s (Meredith Baxter), in episode 12, &quot;The Homecoming&quot; on &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot;. In 1974, Brittany was hired by Japanese cosmetics company Kanebo to be the &quot;face&quot; of their product, Ireine, so moved to Tokyo from 1974 to 1976 and traveled around the world as the image of Kanebo Cosmetics.
Brittany portrayed actress Vivien Leigh in &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot; (1976) a biography of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard. She also appeared in the John Schlesinger film &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975) as Leigh in the climax of the film. That was followed by TV movies and series, such as &quot;The Amazing Howard Hughes&quot; (1977), &quot;The Initiation of Sarah&quot; (1978), &quot;Death Car on the Freeway&quot; (1979), &quot;The Dream Merchants&quot; (1980), and &quot;&quot; (1987). In 1980, while filming an episode of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, Brittany met her future husband, stuntman Jack Gill.

Brittany appeared again as Vivien Leigh in the climax of the made-for-TV movie about the search for an actress to star in &quot;Gone with the Wind&#x27;s&quot; film adaptation, &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot; (1980).

This caught the attention of the producers of &quot;Dallas&quot;, who were searching for an actress to play Katherine Wentworth, the scheming half-sister of Pamela Ewing and Cliff Barnes. Brittany debuted on &quot;Dallas&quot; in the 1981–82 season and her role as Katherine continued, on and off, until 1987. In 1985, she returned in that season&#x27;s finale, where her character killed Bobby Ewing by striking him with a car, killing herself in the process. She made a brief, final appearance on the series in 1987, which was plausible storyline-wise because Bobby&#x27;s death and Katherine&#x27;s turned out to be part of Pamela&#x27;s 31-episode dream (i.e., season 9). 

In 1984, Brittany co-starred in the short-lived ABC drama series, &quot;Glitter&quot;, as Kate Simpson, a reporter for an entertainment magazine. This was one of several collaborations with producer Aaron Spelling throughout her career. Her first show with him had been an appearance in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, in 1964 when Brittany was a child. Later, as an adult, she appeared in seven episodes of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and the 1990s revival of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;. Brittany appeared in &quot;The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch&quot; (1982). 

Brittany co-hosted the syndicated sports show &quot;Star Games&quot;. and later hosted more than 100 episodes of the magazine show &quot;Photoplay&quot;, produced by Jack Haley Jr. 

Brittany guest-starred on such other series as &quot;Married... with Children&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;The Perry Mason Mysteries&quot;; &quot;Dear John&quot;; &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;; and &quot;The Nanny&quot;. In film, Brittany starred in &quot;&quot; (1989).

===Later years===

In the 1990s, Brittany appeared in independent films, including &quot;Riders in the Storm&quot; (1995), &quot;Legend of the Spirit Dog&quot; (1997), &quot;The Protector&quot; (1997), &quot;The Biggest Fan&quot; (2002), &quot;Mothers and Daughters&quot; (2006), and &quot;Americanizing Shelley&quot; (2007). She also appeared in the docudrama, &quot;1 a Minute&quot; (2010).

==Personal life==
Brittany married stuntman Jack Gill in 1981. They have two children, daughter Katie and son Cody.

As of 2014, Brittany is a conservative political commentator and author. She writes a weekly column for &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot;.

Her first book, with co-authors Ann-Marie Murrell and Dr. Gina Loudon, &quot;What Women Really Want&quot;, was released September 2, 2014. She is a recurring guest on &quot;Hannity&quot; (FOX News), and &quot;The Rick Amato Show&quot; (One America) and has appeared on &quot;The Kudlow Report&quot; (CNBC), &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;, and &quot;Huckabee&quot;. 

She is a co-owner and anchor for &quot;PolitiChicks&quot;, an online news site with a conservative perspective. Her second book, with co-author Ann-Marie Murrell, was released in 2017. &quot;PolitiChicks: A Clarion Call to Political Activism&quot; is a compilation book of essays from &quot;PolitiChicks&quot; writers. Brittany now travels the country speaking at major venues including The Heritage Foundation and other conservative organizations.

<doc id="1106782" wikidata="Q5564162" url="?curid=1106782" title="Greene King">
<text>Greene King is a British pub and brewing company founded in 1799, currently based in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. The company also owns brands including Hungry Horse and Farmhouse Inns, as well as other pubs, restaurants and hotels. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), until it was acquired by CK Assets in October 2019.

Its best known beers are Greene King IPA and Abbot Ale, the third and fifth highest selling cask ales in Britain.

==History==

The brewery was founded by Benjamin Greene in Bury St. Edmunds in 1799. In Richard Wilson&#x27;s biographical analysis of the Greene family, he credits various family members for being able to achieve distinction in the worlds of business and banking, literature (Graham Greene, for example) and broadcasting in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&#x27;

In 1836 Edward Greene took over the business and in 1887 it merged with Frederick William King&#x27;s brewing business to create Greene King.

Greene King has grown via mergers and acquisitions, including Rayments Brewery (1961), the Magic Pub Company (1996), Hungry Horse (1996), Morland Brewery (1999), Old English Inns (2001), Morrells (2002), a large part of the Laurel Pub Company (2004), Ridley&#x27;s Brewery (2005), Belhaven Brewery (2005), Hardys and Hansons (2006), the Loch Fyne fish restaurant chain (2007), Cloverleaf (2011), Realpubs (2011), the Capital Pub Company (2011) and the Spirit Pub Company (2015).

The Spirit acquisition, where Greene King bought Spirit for £773.6m, took the total number of Greene King sites to 3,116, brought 14 brands together and made Greene King the largest managed pub company in the UK. It was completed on 23 June 2015.

It was announced in November 2018 that Rooney Anand would be stepping down from his role as CEO after 14 years in the position.

In 2019 the Hong Kong based CK Assets announced the proposed take over of Greene King, which shareholders had to approve. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, the holding company took the view that the pubs owned by Greene King are an asset that is safe from potential recession. Analyst David Blennerhassett told the &quot;FT&quot; that CK Assets has a track record of buying such assets in the UK and he does not expect it to sell Greene King later as a bet on the falling pound. The takeover was approved by the High Court in October 2019.

==Operations==

The Greene King brewery in Bury St Edmunds produces beers branded in the names of breweries now closed, including Morland (Old Speckled Hen), Ruddles, Hardys &amp; Hanson Kimberley Ale and Tolly Cobbold. The Belhaven Brewery in Dunbar continues to operate in Scotland.

The group operates 3,100 pubs, restaurants and hotels:
* Its retail division is split between its destination pubs and restaurants (with brands including Hungry Horse, Loch Fyne, Taylor Walker and Metropolitan Pub Company) and its local pubs. Its strategy is to open further retail outlets.
* Its pub partners division has leased, tenanted and franchised pubs. Its strategy is to reduce the numbers of these outlets.

==Visitor centre==

There is a visitor centre next to the brewery, and tours are run regularly throughout the week. The brewery has an exhibition of pub sign artwork by George Taylor, who designed over 250 such signs for Greene King pubs.

==People==
Greene King has been supporting apprenticeships since 2011 through its Greene King Apprenticeship Programme. Since launch, the scheme has processed some 9,000 apprentices.

In 2016, Greene King launched the Get into Hospitality Programme in partnership with The Prince&#x27;s Trust. The aim of the programme is to address the skills and experience gaps that prevent unemployed people from getting into work. Those who successfully complete and graduate from the programme are offered a role onto the Greene King Apprenticeship Programme.

In 2017, Greene King launched the Craft Academy, an 18-month brewing venture led by apprentices. Through the programme, apprentices earn while they learn about brewing, design and marketing. Through the scheme, they will gain a Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Sales. The first five beers from the Craft Academy were launched at Craft Beer Rising Festival in London and include; Over Easy (3.8% session IPA), Big Bang IPA (5.6% bold and citrusy IPA), Bitter Sweet (6% black IPA), Desert Ryeder (4.8% rye beer) and High &amp; Dry (5% dry hop lager).

==Criticism==

Greene King&#x27;s ongoing business expansion has sometimes been the subject of criticism. As a result of its active acquisition policy, it has come to be known by beer protesters as &quot;Greedy King&quot;. The growing consumer reaction to Greene King buying out smaller breweries was demonstrated towards the end of 2006 when a pub in Lewes, East Sussex started a well-publicised protest against Greene King for removing the locally produced Harvey&#x27;s Sussex Best Bitter from sale, while continuing to sell other guest beers.

In January 2014, popular Manchester pub The Lass O&#x27;Gowrie, voted &quot;Best Pub in Britain&quot; at the Great British Pub Awards in 2012, closed after the landlord was forced out in an argument over rent. Having lost 40% of their trade after the BBC moved to Salford, the landlord had won a rent reduction at an independent tribunal before being forced out by the brewery.

Greene King has also been criticised for removing many traditional and historic pub signs as part of rebranding schemes.

In 2021, residents of Linlithgow launched a petition aimed at preventing Greene King from changing the name of &quot;The Black Bitch&quot; pub to &quot;The Black Hound&quot;. The term &quot;black bitches&quot; is traditionally used for natives of the town, and an image of a black bitch (a female dog) appears on the town&#x27;s coat of arms. Greene King argued that the name &quot;The Black Bitch&quot; had &quot;racist and offensive connotations&quot;.

On 27 January 2024, the Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis announced plans to seek slavery reparations from Greene King, due to its founder Benjamin Greene&#x27;s historical ownership of 231 enslaved people in St Kitts. Talks have been scheduled between St Kitts and Nevis officials and Greene King.

==Beers==
===Greene King===
* Abbot Ale – A premium bitter (5.0% abv) first brewed in the 1950s. The ingredients are pale, crystal and amber malts; with First Gold, Challenger and Fuggles hops – the Fuggles being late-hopped.

<doc id="1106784" wikidata="Q1752284" url="?curid=1106784" title="Cancer staging">
<text>Cancer staging is the process of determining the extent to which a cancer has grown and spread. A number from I to IV is assigned, with I being an isolated cancer and IV being a cancer that has metastasized and spread from its origin. The stage generally takes into account the size of a tumor, whether it has invaded adjacent organs, how many regional (nearby) lymph nodes it has spread to (if any), and whether it has appeared in more distant locations (metastasized).

==TNM staging system==
Cancer staging can be divided into a clinical stage and a pathologic stage. In the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) system, clinical stage and pathologic stage are denoted by a small &quot;c&quot; or &quot;p&quot; before the stage (e.g., cT3N1M0 or pT2N0). This staging system is used for most forms of cancer, except brain tumors and hematological malignancies.
* Clinical stage is based on all of the available information obtained before a surgery to remove the tumor. This stage may include information about the tumor obtained by physical examination, blood tests, radiologic examination, biopsy, and endoscopy.
* Pathologic stage adds additional information gained by examination of the tumor microscopically by a pathologist after it has been surgically removed.

Because they use different criteria, clinical stage and pathologic stage often differ. Pathologic staging is usually considered to be more accurate because it allows direct examination of the tumor in its entirety, contrasted with clinical staging which is limited by the fact that the information is obtained by making indirect observations of a tumor which is still in the body. However, clinical staging and pathologic staging often complement each other. Not every tumor is treated surgically, so pathologic staging is not always available. Also, sometimes surgery is preceded by other treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy which shrink the tumor, so the pathologic stage may underestimate the true stage.

==Considerations==
Correct staging is critical because treatment (particularly the need for pre-operative therapy and/or for adjuvant treatment, the extent of surgery) is generally based on this parameter. Thus, incorrect staging would lead to improper treatment.

For some common cancers the staging process is well-defined. For example, in the cases of breast cancer and prostate cancer, doctors routinely can identify that the cancer is early and that it has low risk of metastasis. In such cases, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans because research shows that the risk of getting such procedures outweighs the possible benefits. Some of the problems associated with overtesting include patients receiving invasive procedures, overutilizing medical services, getting unnecessary radiation exposure, and experiencing misdiagnosis.

===Pathologic===
Pathologic staging, where a pathologist examines sections of tissue, can be particularly problematic for two specific reasons: visual discretion and random sampling of tissue. &quot;Visual discretion&quot; means being able to identify single cancerous cells intermixed with healthy cells on a slide. Oversight of one cell can mean misstaging and lead to serious, unexpected spread of cancer. &quot;Random sampling&quot; refers to the fact that lymph nodes are cherry-picked from patients and random samples are examined. If cancerous cells present in the lymph node happen not to be present in the slices of tissue viewed, incorrect staging and improper treatment can result.

===Current research===

New, highly sensitive methods of staging are in development. For example, the mRNA for GCC (guanylyl cyclase c), present only in the luminal aspect of intestinal epithelium, can be identified using molecular screening (RT-PCR) with a high degree of sensitivity and exactitude. Presence of GCC in any other tissue of the body represents colorectal metaplasia. Because of its high sensitivity, RT-PCR screening for GCC greatly reduces underestimation of disease stage. Researchers hope that staging with this level of precision will lead to more appropriate treatment and better prognosis. Furthermore, researchers hope that this same technique can be applied to other tissue-specific proteins.

==Systems==
Staging systems are specific for each type of cancer (e.g., breast cancer and lung cancer), but some cancers do not have a staging system. Although competing staging systems still exist for some types of cancer, the universally-accepted staging system is that of the UICC, which has the same definitions of individual categories as the AJCC.

Systems of staging may differ between diseases or specific manifestations of a disease. 

===Blood===
* Lymphoma: most use Ann Arbor staging
* Hodgkin lymphoma: follows a scale from I to IV and can be indicated further by an A or B, depending on whether a patient is non-symptomatic or has symptoms such as fevers. It is known as the &quot;Cotswold System&quot; or &quot;Modified Ann Arbor Staging System&quot;.

===Solid===
For solid tumors, TNM is by far the most commonly used system, but it has been adapted for some conditions.
* Brain cancer: For most brain cancers, no staging systems are available and they are instead graded. Embryonal CNS tumors like medulloblastoma are staged following a classification developed by Chang et al.
* Breast cancer: In breast cancer classification, staging is usually based on TNM, but staging in I–IV may be used as well.
* Cervical and ovarian cancers: the &quot;FIGO&quot; system has been adopted into the TNM system. For premalignant dysplastic changes, the CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) grading system is used.
* Colon cancer: originally consisted of four stages: A, B, C, and D (the Dukes staging system). More recently, colon cancer staging is indicated either by the original A-D stages or by TNM.
* Kidney cancer: uses TNM.
* Cancer of the larynx: Uses TNM.
* Liver cancer: Uses TNM.
* Lung cancer: uses TNM.
* Melanoma: TNM used. Also of importance are the &quot;Clark level&quot; and &quot;Breslow depth&quot; which refer to the microscopic depth of tumor invasion (&quot;Microstaging&quot;).
* Prostate cancer: TNM almost universally used.
* Testicular cancer: uses TNM along with a measure of blood serum markers (TNMS).
* Non-melanoma skin cancer: uses TNM.
* Bladder cancer: uses TNM.

==Overall stage grouping==

Overall Stage Grouping is also referred to as Roman Numeral Staging. This system uses numerals I, II, III, and IV (plus the 0) to describe the progression of cancer.
* Stage 0: carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot;, abnormal cells growing in their normal place (&quot;in situ&quot; from Latin for &quot;in its place&quot;).
** Stage 0 can also mean no remaining cancer after preoperative treatment in some cancers (e.g. colorectal cancer).
* Stage I: cancers are localized to one part of the body. Stage I cancer can be surgically removed if small enough.
* Stage II: cancers are locally advanced. Stage II cancer can be treated by chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery.
* Stage III: cancers are also locally advanced. Whether a cancer is designated as Stage II or Stage III can depend on the specific type of cancer; for example, in Hodgkin&#x27;s Disease, Stage II indicates affected lymph nodes on only one side of the diaphragm, whereas Stage III indicates affected lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The specific criteria for Stages II and III therefore differ according to diagnosis. Stage III can be treated by chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery.
* Stage IV: cancers have often metastasized, or spread to other organs or throughout the body. Stage IV cancer can be treated by chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Despite treatment, a patient&#x27;s mortality rate can be significantly higher with Stage IV cancer, e.g., the cancer can progress to become terminal.

Within the TNM system, a cancer may also be designated as recurrent, meaning that it has appeared again after being in remission or after all visible tumor has been eliminated. Recurrence can either be local, meaning that it appears in the same location as the original, or distant, meaning that it appears in a different part of the body.

==Stage migration==
Stage migration is a change in the distribution of stages in a particular cancer population, induced by either a change in the staging system itself or else a change in technology which allows more sensitive detection of tumor spread and therefore more sensitivity in detecting spread of disease (e.g., the use of MRI scans). Stage migration can lead to curious statistical phenomena (for example, the Will Rogers phenomenon).

<doc id="1106787" wikidata="Q2058024" url="?curid=1106787" title="Takashimaya">
<text>is a Japanese multinational corporation operating a department store chain carrying a wide array of products, ranging from wedding dresses and other apparel to electronics and flatware. It has more than 12 branches strategically located in 2 regions, and 4 international branches around Asia.

Takashimaya has been a member of the International Association of Department Stores from 1962 to 1997.

Takashimaya was listed at #1197 on the Forbes Global 2000 list for 2006.

Takashimaya is a member of the Sanwa Group keiretsu.

==History==

The first Takashimaya store was opened in Kyoto in 1831 as a sole proprietorship owned by Shinshichi Iida, a merchant from present-day Fukui Prefecture. The original store in Kyoto was only 3.6 square meters in area and specialized in selling gofuku (formal kimono). A second Kyoto store opened in 1893, followed by a Tokyo store in 1897 and an Osaka store in 1898. Takashimaya was incorporated as a gomei kaisha (unlimited liability company) in 1909 and converted to a kabushiki kaisha (stock company) in 1919.

Takashimaya began an export business in 1876, following the Meiji Restoration, and established an in-house trading unit in 1887. By 1903 Takashimaya had offices in Paris and London and an export office in Yokohama. The trading unit was spun off as a new stock company, , in 1913. Takashimaya-Iida later merged with the trading company Marubeni.

The chain saw a major expansion in the early 1930s. In 1931 it opened a &quot;10, 20 and 50 sen store&quot; in Osaka, a predecessor of today&#x27;s 100 yen store. Its flagship store in Namba, Osaka opened in 1932, and a second flagship store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo opened in 1933. The Tokyo and Osaka stores were damaged by the firebombings of Tokyo and Osaka in 1945 but were not destroyed, and served as centers for logistics during the occupation of Japan. Due to postwar regulations on the size of new stores, many Takashimaya locations opened from the 1950s onward, including its Yokohama and Yonago stores, were set up as separate companies.

In 1958, Takashimaya opened a store in New York City which eventually occupied 37,000 square feet of floor space at 693 Fifth Avenue. The New York store closed in 2010 as Takashimaya chose to refocus on East and Southeast Asian markets amid struggling sales.

In 1969, Takashimaya opened Japan&#x27;s first American-style suburban shopping center near Futako-Tamagawa Station, to the southwest of Tokyo.

The Japanese department store industry went through a wave of consolidation during a revenue slump in the 2000s, with Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings (parent of Mitsukoshi and Isetan) becoming the largest player in the industry, followed by J. Front Retailing (parent of Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Stores). In 2008, Takashimaya announced plans to merge with H2O Retailing, the parent of the Osaka-based Hanshin Department Store and Hankyu Department Store chains, which would have formed the largest department store operator in Japan. Takashimaya and H2O entered into a cross-shareholding relationship prior to the merger, with each acquiring 10% of the other&#x27;s stock, but announced the cancellation of their merger in 2010.

In 2019, the company announced it would closing its mainland China store in Shanghai on August 25, but retracted its decision after it gained support from local governments.

<doc id="1106793" wikidata="Q1369011" url="?curid=1106793" title="Familial adenomatous polyposis">
<text>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and [[attenuated FAP]] (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused by &quot;APC&quot; gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or [[MUTYH-associated polyposis]]) is caused by defects in the &quot;MUTYH&quot; gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are initially confined to the colon wall. Detection and removal before metastasis outside the colon can greatly reduce and in many cases eliminate the spread of cancer.

The root cause of FAP is understood to be a genetic mutation—a change in the body&#x27;s tumour suppressor genes that prevent development of tumours. The change allows numerous cells of the intestinal wall to develop into potentially cancerous polyps when they would usually reach the end of their life; inevitably one or more will eventually progress and give rise to cancer (7% risk by age 21, rising to 87% by age 45 and 93% by age 50). These gene changes do not trigger cancer, but rather, they reduce the body&#x27;s ability to prevent cells from becoming cancerous. Even with the gene change, it may still take time before a cell actually does develop that is cancerous as a result, and the gene may in some cases still partially operate to control tumours, therefore cancer from FAP takes many years to develop and is almost always an adult-onset disease.

The second form of FAP, known as [[attenuation|attenuated]] familial adenomatous polyposis has the &quot;APC&quot; gene functional but slightly impaired. It is therefore somewhat able to operate as usual. Attenuated FAP still presents a high 70% lifetime risk of cancer (as estimated), but typically presents with far fewer polyps (typically 30) rather than the hundreds or thousands usually found in FAP, and arises at an age when FAP is usually no longer considered likely—typically between 40 and 70 years old (average 55) rather than the more usual 30s upward. Because it has far fewer polyps, options for management may be different.

The third variant, autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis or MUTYH-associated polyposis, is also milder and, as its name suggests, requires both parents to be &#x27;carriers&#x27; to manifest the condition.

In some cases FAP can manifest higher in the colon than usual (for example, the ascending colon, or proximal to the splenic flexure, or in the stomach or duodenum) where they show no symptoms until cancer is present and greatly advanced. APC mutations have been linked to certain other cancers such as thyroid cancer. As the mutation causing FAP is autosomal dominant, it can be inherited directly from either parent to a child. A genetic blood test of the &quot;APC&quot; gene exists that can determine whether it is present, and therefore can predict the possibility of FAP. Individuals at risk (due to family links or genetic testing) are usually offered routine monitoring of the intestinal tract every 1–3 years for life, from puberty for FAP and early adulthood for attenuated forms. Colon resection surgery is recommended if numerous colon polyps are found due to high risk of early death from colon cancer. International polyposis registries exist that track known cases of FAP or &quot;APC&quot; gene defects, for research and clinical purposes. Mutation of APC also occurs commonly in incident cases of colorectal carcinoma, emphasizing its importance in this form of cancer.

==Signs and symptoms==
From early adolescence, patients with this condition gradually (and much of the time asymptomatically) develop hundreds to thousands of colorectal polyps (and sometimes polyps elsewhere)—small abnormalities at the surface of the intestinal tract, especially in the large intestine including the colon or rectum. These may bleed, leading to blood in the stool. If the blood is not visible, it is still possible for the patient to develop anemia due to gradually developing iron deficiency. If malignancy develops, this may present with weight loss, altered bowel habit, or even metastasis to the liver or elsewhere. FAP can also develop &#x27;silently&#x27; in some individuals, giving few or no signs until it has developed into advanced colorectal cancer.

Because familial polyposis develops very gradually over years, and can also manifest in an &#x27;attenuated&#x27; form even more gradually, polyps resulting from FAP can lead to cancer developing at any point from adolescence to old age.

Depending on the nature of the defect in the APC gene, and whether it is the full or attenuated form, familial polyposis may manifest as polyps in colon or in the duodenal tract, or in any combination of these. Therefore, an absence of polyps in, for example, the rectum, may not of itself be sufficient to confirm absence of polyps. It may be necessary to consider and visually examine other possible parts of the intestinal tract. Colonoscopy is preferred over sigmoidoscopy for this, as it provides better observation of the common right-side location of polyps.
The genetic determinant in familial polyposis may also predispose carriers to other malignancies, e.g., of the duodenum and stomach (particularly ampullary adenocarcinoma). Other signs that may point to FAP are the development of Gardner fibromas and desmoid tumors (benign skin tumors that may be apparent before other signs of FAP), pigmented lesions of the retina (&quot;CHRPE—congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium&quot;), jaw cysts, sebaceous cysts, and osteomata (benign bone tumors). The combination of polyposis, osteomas, fibromas and sebaceous cysts is termed &quot;Gardner&#x27;s syndrome&quot; (with or without abnormal scarring).

== Genetics ==
Familial adenomatous polyposis can have different inheritance patterns and different genetic causes. When this condition results from mutations in the &quot;APC&quot; gene, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. The incidence of malignancy in these cases approaches 100%. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.

===APC gene mutation variants===
The &quot;APC&quot; is a tumour suppressor gene responsible for the production of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a large multifunction tumour-suppressing protein which acts as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; to prevent development of tumours. (APC regulates β-catenin, a protein that plays a crucial role in cell communication, signalling, growth, and controlled destruction, but which left uncontrolled also gives rise to numerous cancers). A flaw in the APC gene means APC is not as effective as it should be, and over time it is likely that some cells that should have been controlled by APC will not be, and will instead continue to develop and become cancerous. In familiar polyposis they usually manifest as polyps—small abnormalities on the surface of the intestinal tract.

Although the polyps are inherently benign, the first step of the two-hit hypothesis has already taken place: the inherited APC mutation. Often, the remaining &quot;normal&quot; allele is mutated or deleted, accelerating generation of polyps. Further mutations (e.g., in p53 or &quot;kRAS&quot;) to APC-mutated cells are much more likely to lead to cancer than they would in non-mutated epithelial cells.

The normal function of the APC gene product is still being investigated; it is present in both the cell nucleus and the membrane. The canonical tumor-suppressor function of APC is suppression of β-catenin, but other tumor-suppressor functions of APC may be related to cell adherence and cytoskeleton organization.

Mutation of &quot;APC&quot; also occurs commonly in incident cases of colorectal carcinoma, emphasizing its importance in this form of cancer.

===MUTYH gene mutation variants===

&quot;MUTYH&quot; encodes DNA repair enzyme MYH glycosylase. During normal cellular activities, guanine sometimes becomes altered by oxygen, which causes it to pair with adenine instead of cytosine. MYH glycosylase fixes these mistakes by base excision repair, such that mutations do not accumulate in the DNA and lead to tumor formation. When MYH glycosylase does not function correctly, DNA errors may accrue to initiate tumorigenesis with a clinical presentation similar to that in patients with APC mutations.

Mutations in the &quot;MUTYH&quot; gene are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by the disorder. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.

=== Animal models ===
The &quot;ApcMin&quot; mouse model was described in 1990 and carries an &quot;Apc&quot; allele with a stop codon at position 850. Heterozygosity for this mutation results in a fully penetrant phenotype on most genetic backgrounds, with mice on a sensitive background developing over 100 tumors in the intestinal tract. The number and location of the intestinal tumors are modified by unlinked genes. Many other models have since appeared, including a model of attenuated FAP (the 1638N model) and several conditional mutants that allow for tissue-specific or temporal ablation of gene function. For more information see mouse models of colorectal and intestinal cancer.

In 2007, the &quot;ApcPirc&quot; rat model was isolated with a stop codon at position 1137. In contrast to the mouse models where &gt;90% of tumors form in the small intestine, the Pirc rat forms tumors preferentially (&gt;60%) in the large intestine, similar to the human clinical presentation.

==Diagnosis==

Making the diagnosis of FAP before the development of colon cancer is important not just for the individual, but also for the sake of other family members who may be affected. Two diagnostic methods exist:
* Colonoscopy is the usual diagnostic test of choice as it favours the common right-side location of polyps better than sigmoidoscopy if the mutation is attenuated FAP, and can confirm or allow (a) the actual clinical presentation and any change to the condition, of the &#x27;at risk&#x27; individual, (b) quantification of polyps throughout the colon, (c) a histologic diagnosis (cell/cancer type detection) and (d) where polyps exist, it can suggest whether outpatient excision (removal) is viable or surgery is recommended. Barium enema and virtual colonoscopy (a form of medical imaging) can also be used to suggest the diagnosis of FAP.
* Genetic testing provides the ultimate diagnosis in 95% of cases; genetic counseling is usually needed in families where FAP has been diagnosed. Testing may also aid in the diagnosis of borderline cases in families that are otherwise known to p34.3 and p32.1 (1p34.3–p32.1). Testing can only show if an individual is susceptible to FAP or rule it out (i.e., whether or not they inherited the defective APC gene). It cannot determine the actual condition of a patient; this can only be found by direct physical examination.

NCBI states that physicians must ensure they understand the &quot;risks, benefits, and limitations&quot; of any genetic test done since in 1997 &quot;for almost one-third of individuals assessed for FAP, the physician misinterpreted the test results&quot;.

Once the diagnosis of FAP is made, close colonoscopic surveillance with polypectomy is required.

Prenatal testing is possible if a disease-causing mutation is identified in an affected family member; however, prenatal testing for typically adult-onset disorders is uncommon and requires careful genetic counseling.

Ultrasound of the abdomen and blood tests evaluating liver function are often performed to rule out metastasis to the liver.

==Management==

Because of the way familial polyposis develops, it is possible to have the genetic condition, and therefore be at risk, but have no polyps or issues so far. Therefore, an individual may be diagnosed &quot;at risk of&quot; FAP, and require routine monitoring, but not (yet) actually have FAP (i.e., carries a defective gene but as yet appears not to have any actual medical issue as a result of this). Clinical management can cover several areas:
* Identifying those individuals who could be at risk of FAP: usually from family medical history or genetic testing
* Diagnosis (confirming whether they have FAP)—this can be done either by genetic testing, which is definitive or by visually checking the intestinal tract itself.
:: It is important to note that visual examination, or monitoring, cannot &#x27;clear&#x27; a person of risk. It can only say what their condition is at the time. If at any point in their life the person develops numerous polyps, this would tend to suggest a diagnosis of FAP. (Absence of polyps does not &#x27;clear&#x27; a person, as polyps can develop later in life; also a few polyps over time are not that uncommon in people without FAP. However a &quot;substantial&quot; number or a &quot;profusion&quot; of polyps would generally tend to suggest a diagnosis of FAP, and histopathology to determine whether or not any polyps are cancerous.)
* Screening/monitoring programs involve visually examining the intestinal tract to check its healthy condition. It is undertaken as a routine matter every few years where there is cause for concern when either (a) a genetic test has confirmed the risk or (b) a genetic test has not been undertaken for any reason so the actual risk is unknown. Screening and monitoring allow polyposis to be detected visually before it can become life-threatening.
* Treatment, typically surgery of some kind, is involved if polyposis has led to a large number of polyps, or a significant risk of cancer, or actual cancer.

===Family history===
NCBI states that &quot;Although most individuals diagnosed with an APC-associated polyposis condition have an affected parent, the family history may appear to be negative because of failure to recognize the disorder in family members, early death of the parent before the onset of symptoms, or late onset of the disease in the affected parent.&quot; In addition around 20% of cases are a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation, and of those with an apparent de novo APC mutation (i.e. no known family history) 20% have somatic mosaicism. Asymptomatic individuals (and therefore asymptomatic family members) are also known to exist.

===Monitoring===
Monitoring involves the provision of outpatient colonoscopy, and occasionally upper gastric tract esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD, to search for premalignant gastric or duodenal cancers), typically once every 1–3 years, and/or a genetic blood test to definitively confirm or deny susceptibility. A small number of polyps can often be excised (removed) during the procedure if found, but if there are more severe signs or numbers, inpatient surgery may be required.

NCBI states that when an individual is identified as having FAP, or the mutations resulting in FAP: &quot;It is appropriate to evaluate the parents of an affected individual (a) with molecular genetic testing of APC if the disease-causing mutation is known in the proband [person first identified with the condition] or (b) for clinical manifestations of APC-associated polyposis conditions&quot;.

===Treatment===
Treatment for FAP depends on the genotype. Most individuals with the APC mutation will develop colon cancer by the age of 40, although the less-common attenuated version typically manifests later in life (40–70). Accordingly, in many cases, prophylactic surgery may be recommended before the age of 25, or upon detection if actively monitored. There are several surgical options that involve the removal of either the colon or both the colon and rectum.
* Rectum involved: the rectum and part or all of the colon are removed. The patient may require an ileostomy (permanent stoma where stool goes into a bag on the abdomen) or have an ileo-anal pouch reconstruction. The decision to remove the rectum depends on the number of polyps in the rectum as well as the family history. If the rectum has few polyps, the colon is partly or fully removed and the small bowel (ileum) can be directly connected to the rectum instead (ileorectal anastomosis).
* Rectum not involved: the portion of the colon manifesting polyps can be removed and the ends &#x27;rejoined&#x27; (partial colectomy), a surgery that has a substantial healing time but leaves quality of life largely intact.

Prophylactic colectomy is indicated if more than a hundred polyps are present, if there are severely dysplastic polyps, or if multiple polyps larger than 1 cm are present.

Treatment for the two milder forms of FAP may be substantially different from the more usual variant, as the number of polyps is far fewer, allowing more options.

Various medications are being investigated for slowing malignant degeneration of polyps, most prominently the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDS have been shown to significantly decrease the number of polyps but do not usually alter management since there are still too many polyps to be followed and treated endoscopically. The drug eflornithine, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase typically used to treat trypanosomiasis, is being investigated as a potential preventive medication in combination with the NSAID celecoxib for treatment of FAP. Another investigational agent is sulindac, also used in combination with NSAIDs.

== Prognosis ==
Prior to reaching the advanced stages of colorectal cancer, the polyps are confined to the inner wall and thickness of the intestinal tract and do not metastasize or &#x27;spread&#x27;. So provided FAP is detected and controlled either at the pre-cancerous stage or when any cancerous polyps are still internal to the intestinal tract, surgery has a very high success rate of preventing or removing cancer, without recurrence, since the locations giving rise to cancer are physically removed &quot;in toto&quot; by the surgery.

Following surgery, if a partial colectomy has been performed, colonoscopic surveillance of the remaining colon is necessary as the individual still has a risk of developing colon cancer. However, if this happened, it would be a fresh incident from polyps developing anew in the unremoved part of the colon subsequent to surgery, rather than a return or metastasis of any cancer removed by the original surgery.

Desmoid tumors, with their infiltrative nature and potential proximity to vital structures, are the second highest cause of death.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of the mutation is between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 15,000 births. By age 35 years, 95% of individuals with FAP (&gt;100 adenomas) have polyps. Without colectomy, colon cancer is virtually inevitable. The mean age of colon cancer in untreated individuals is 39 years (range 34–43 years).

Attenuated FAP arises when APC is defective but still somewhat functional. As a result, it retains part of its ability to suppress polyps. Therefore, attenuated FAP manifests as colorectal cancer unusually late (age 40–70, average=55), and typically with few, or at least far fewer polyps (typically 30), than the more usual version of FAP, at an age when FAP is no longer considered much of a likelihood or risk according to usual FAP epidemiology.

===Comparison of FAP variants===
This table compares the different subtypes of FAP:

== Polyposis registries ==
Because of the genetic nature of FAP, polyposis registries have been developed around the world. The purpose of these registries is to increase knowledge about the transmissibility of FAP, but also to document, track, and notify family members of affected individuals. One study has shown that the use of a registry to notify family members (call-ups) significantly reduced mortality when compared with probands. The St. Mark&#x27;s polyposis registry is the oldest in the world, started in 1924, and many other polyposis registries now exist.

<text>Milestone Records is an American jazz record company and label founded in 1966 by Orrin Keepnews and Dick Katz in New York City. The company was bought by Fantasy Records in 1972. Since then, it has produced LP reissues (including items from Keepnew&#x27;s earlier Riverside label) as well as new recordings. Sonny Rollins and McCoy Tyner are among the musicians who recorded for the label.

Milestone has reissued many historic jazz recording sessions, including the Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver, and the New Orleans Rhythm Kings sides made for Gennett Records in the 1920s. The label also issued blues albums, most of them produced by Pete Welding. They include Driftin&#x27; Slim &amp; His Blues Band&#x27;s &quot;Somebody Hoo-Doo&#x27;d The Hoo-Doo Man,&quot; in addition to LPs by Mississippi Fred McDowell and Big Joe Williams.

Another company called Milestone Records was active in the late 1950s, releasing music by acts such as The Jodimars and The Blue Jays. This label was owned by rockabilly musician Werly Fairburn.

<doc id="1106796" wikidata="Q504735" url="?curid=1106796" title="Juan de Fuca">
<text>Juan de Fuca (10 June 1536 23 July 1602) was a Greek sailor who served PhilipII of Spain. He is best known for his claim to have explored the Strait of Aniánnow known as the Strait of Juan de Fucabetween Vancouver Island (now part of British Columbia, Canada) and the Olympic Peninsula (northwestern Washington state in the United States).
==Name==
&quot;Juan de Fuca&quot; is a hispanicization of the Greek name or Phokas (), latinized as . However, his exact name is somewhat uncertain. Some sources state that his actual name was Apostolos Valerianos (). It is possible that he was baptized as Apostolos and later adopted the name Ioannis or Juan because &quot;&quot; is not a common Spanish name. It is known that his father and grandfather bore the name Focas, so it seems likely that Valerianos was a nickname or epithet borrowed from the village where he grew up on Cefalonia.

==Family and early life==
De Fuca&#x27;s grandfather Emmanouil Fokas () fled Constantinople during its fall in 1453, accompanied by his brother Andronikos (). The two settled first in the Peloponnese, where Andronikos remained, but in 1470 Emmanouil moved to the island of Cefalonia. Ioannis&#x27;s father Iakovos () established himself in the village of Valerianos on the island and came to be known as &quot;the Valeriano Fokas&quot; (, &quot;Fokas ho Valerianos&quot;) to distinguish him from his brothers. De Fuca was born in Valerianos on June 10, 1536. Little is known about his life before he entered the service of Spain some time around 1555.

==Early career==
De Fuca&#x27;s early voyages were to the Far East, and he claimed to have arrived in New Spain in 1587 when, off Cabo San Lucas in Baja California, the English privateer Thomas Cavendish seized his galleon &quot;Santa Ana&quot; and deposited him ashore. He was a well-traveled seaman, perfecting his skill as a pilot in the Spanish fleet. The King of Spain, he also claimed, recognized him for his excellence and made him pilot of the Spanish navy in the West Indies (a title he held for forty years), but there is no record in Spanish archives of his name or position or of his visit to the royal court. Before he made his famous trip up the northwest coast of the North American continent, he sailed to China, the Philippines and Mexico. The Strait of Juan de Fuca between the United States of America and Canada was named for him by British Captain Charles Barkley because it was at the same latitude that Juan de Fuca described as the location of the Strait of Anián.

==Voyages to the north==

According to de Fuca&#x27;s account, he undertook two voyages of exploration on the orders of the Viceroy of New Spain, Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas, both intended to find the fabled Strait of Anián, believed to be a Northwest Passage, a sea route linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The one voyage saw 200 soldiers and three small ships under the overall command of a Spanish captain (with de Fuca as pilot and master) assigned the task of finding the Strait of Anián and fortifying it against the English. This expedition failed when, allegedly due to the captain&#x27;s malfeasance, the soldiers mutinied and returned home to California. (Note that in this period, Spanish doctrine divided control of ships and fleets between the military commander, who was an army officer, and the sailing and navigation commander, who was a mariner.)

In 1592, on his second voyage, De Fuca enjoyed success. Having sailed north with a caravel and a pinnace and a few armed marines, he returned to Acapulco and claimed to have found the strait, with a large island at its mouth, at around 47° north latitude. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is in fact at around 48° N, although Fuca&#x27;s account of sailing into it departs from reality, describing a region far different from what actually existed there. During the voyage, De Fuca also noted a &quot;high pinnacle or spired rock&quot;, which may have been Fuca Pillar, a tall, almost rectangular, rock on the western shore of Cape Flattery on the northwestern tip of Washington beside the Strait of Juan de Fuca - although De Fuca noted it being on the other side of the strait.

Despite Velasco&#x27;s repeated promises, however, De Fuca never received the great rewards he claimed as his due. After two years, and on the viceroy&#x27;s urging, De Fuca travelled to Spain to make his case to the court in person. Disappointed again and disgusted with the Spanish, the aging Greek determined to retire to his home in Kefallonia, but was in 1596 convinced by an Englishman, Michael Lok (also spelled as &quot;Locke&quot; in English and French documents from the period), to offer his services to Spain&#x27;s archenemy, Queen Elizabeth. Nothing came of Lok and De Fuca&#x27;s proposals, but it is through Lok&#x27;s account that the story of Juan de Fuca entered English letters.

==Controversy==
Because the only written evidence for De Fuca&#x27;s voyages lay in Lok&#x27;s account — researchers being unable to find records of the expedition in Spanish colonial archives — there was long much controversy over his discovery and, indeed, whether he had ever even existed as a real person; several scholars have dismissed Juan de Fuca as entirely fictitious, and the 18th-century British explorer Captain Cook strongly doubted that the strait De Fuca claimed to have discovered even existed (although Cook actually sailed past the Strait of Juan de Fuca without entering it and did stop at Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island). With later English exploration and settlement of the area, however, De Fuca&#x27;s claims seemed much more credible.

In 1859, an American researcher, with the help of the U.S. Consul in the Ionian Islands, was able to demonstrate not only that De Fuca had lived but also that his family and history were well known on the islands. While we may never know the exact truths that lay behind the account published by Lok, it must be considered unlikely that the man himself was fictional.

In 2003, Samuel Bawlf posited that &quot;Fuca&#x27;s story was nothing more than a fabrication designed to extract money from the English government&quot;. The story would have in fact been based on Francis Drake 1579 exploration of the Northwest Passage at its western end. Fuca would have learnt about the strait from a pilot named Morera part of the Drake expedition. Morera miraculously returned on his own before getting arrested by the Spanish.

==Legacy==
When the English captain Charles William Barkley, sailing the &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot; in 1787, (re)discovered the strait De Fuca had described, he renamed it the &quot;Strait of Juan de Fuca&quot;.

The Juan de Fuca Ridge and the Juan de Fuca Plate, a tectonic plate underlying much of the coastline he explored, is named for the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Juan de Fuca Provincial Park on Vancouver Island&#x27;s West Coast is named for the strait, as is the hiking trail of the same name.

<text>Leslie Easterbrook is an American actress and producer. She played Sgt./Lt./Capt. Debbie Callahan in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; films and Rhonda Lee on the television series &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;.

==Early life==
Easterbrook was adopted when she was nine months old; her adoptive parents, Carl and Helen Easterbrook, raised her in Arcadia, Nebraska. She attended and graduated from Kearney High School and Stephens College. Her father was a music professor and her mother was an English teacher at the University of Nebraska at Kearney.

==Career==
Easterbrook appeared in about a dozen feature films and over 300 television episodes.

One of her earlier successes was in 1980 as Rhonda Lee beginning with season six of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. The role of Rhonda was part of the show&#x27;s change of locale from Milwaukee to Burbank, California. While playing the role of Rhonda, she appeared as a panelist on Match Game taped on 27 September 1981.

Easterbrook performed as Debbie Callahan in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; film series. She told author Paul Stenning, The funny thing is, that&#x27;s not me at all. I&#x27;d never played tough. I&#x27;d played all kinds of things, but I&#x27;d never played someone who&#x27;s intimidating or someone that was aggressive sexually. I was of a size that I never played the girl who got the guy. I wondered how I could do it. But I did. I went for the audition and I scared the producer and the director and then they backed up in their chairs and I went &#x27;Oh no, now I really blew it. I scared them.&#x27; So I left the audition upset. I didn&#x27;t get to read the script until I got the part. I thought it was outrageous and so funny.

Easterbrook appeared in &quot;Private Resort&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, and &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. In 2005, she replaced Karen Black as Mother Firefly in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;, the sequel to the 2003 horror film, &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;. In 2007, she played security guard Patty Frost in Rob Zombie&#x27;s remake of &quot;Halloween&quot;. In 2008, she played as Betty in the thriller/horror film &quot;House&quot;. In 2010, she starred in &quot;The Afflicted&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; as Devlin Kowalski. Her voice work has been featured in several projects, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

She sang the National Anthem at Super Bowl XVII which landed her starring roles in musicals on Broadway and throughout the country; she recorded a song for the soundtrack of &quot;Police Academy: Mission to Moscow&quot;.

Easterbrook made a video, &quot;Real Beginner&#x27;s Guide to the Shotgun Sports&quot;, the first in a series designed to encourage and prepare nonshooters for their first shooting experience. Easterbrook serves on the board of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, and supports a number of children&#x27;s charities. Easterbrook is a National Rifle Association member and has served on the board of directors of the California Rifle and Pistol Association.

==Personal life==
Easterbrook was married to screenwriter Dan Wilcox until his death in 2024. She is good friends with former &quot;Police Academy&quot; cast member Scott Thomson and was close friends with Marion Ramsey. Easterbrook describes the cast of the original film as a &quot;big family.&quot;

<text>The Jacobite title of Duke of Mar was conferred on John Erskine, 6th/23rd Earl of Mar, by the Jacobite pretender James III and VIII. He was created &quot;Duke of Mar&quot;, &quot;Marquess Erskine&quot; or &quot;Marquess of Stirling&quot;, &quot;Earl of Kildrummie&quot;, &quot;Viscount of Garioch&quot; and &quot;Lord Alloa, Ferriton and Forrest&quot; in the notional Peerage of Scotland in 1715, with the same remainder as his Earldom, i.e. to heirs-general. The Duke&#x27;s attainder by the government of the Hanoverian George I the following year was, of course, not recognised in Jacobite circles. He was further created &quot;Earl of Mar&quot; in the Peerage of England in 1717 and &quot;Duke of Mar&quot; in the Peerage of Ireland in 1722. These titles had the ordinary remainder to heirs male of the body, and became extinct on the death of the grantee&#x27;s son in 1766. The other titles, such as they are, remain extant, although they are not recognised by the British or any other government and have not been claimed or used by their holders since the eighteenth century.

==Dukes of Mar (1722) and Earls of Mar (1717)==
* John Erskine, 6th/23rd and 1st Earl of Mar, 1st Duke of Mar (1675–1732)
* Thomas Erskine, 7th/24th and 2nd Earl of Mar, 2nd Duke of Mar (1705–1766)

==Dukes of Mar (1715)==
(numbering of Earls ignores the attainder of 1716, and is therefore different from that currently used)

* Frances Erskine, 8th/25th Countess of Mar, 3rd Duchess of Mar (died 1776)
* John Francis Erskine, 9th/26th Earl of Mar, 4th Duke of Mar (1741–1825)
* John Thomas Erskine, 10th/27th Earl of Mar, 5th Duke of Mar (1772–1828)
* John Francis Miller Erskine, 11th/28th Earl of Mar, 6th Duke of Mar (1795–1866)
* John Francis Goodeve Erskine, 29th Earl of Mar, 7th Duke of Mar (1836–1930)

<doc id="1106816" wikidata="Q3342107" url="?curid=1106816" title="Nippert Stadium">
<text>James Gamble Nippert Memorial Stadium is an outdoor stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, located on the campus of University of Cincinnati. Primarily used for American football, it has been home to the Cincinnati Bearcats of the Big 12 Conference in rudimentary form since 1901 and as a permanent concrete stadium since 1915, making it the fourth-oldest playing site and fifth-oldest stadium in college football, respectively. 

The stadium has also been used as a soccer venue, serving as the home of FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer from their inaugural 2016 USL season through the 2020 MLS season, following which they moved to TQL Stadium. Nippert Stadium has a current seating capacity of 40,124 following the expansion and renovation performed in 2014, and the 2017 removal of corner seats to accommodate FC Cincinnati during their transition to the MLS.

== Namesake ==
During the final game of the 1923 season with intrastate rival Miami University, UC player James Gamble &quot;Jimmy&quot; Nippert sustained a spike wound injury. He died a month later of blood poisoning, reportedly due to having been infected by droppings left after a pre-game chicken race. Nippert&#x27;s grandfather, James N. Gamble of Procter &amp; Gamble, donated the required funds to complete the stadium. A locker room and training (medical) facility was added as part of the renovation for the safety of players. Nippert&#x27;s brother, Louis, was majority owner of the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s.

== Early history ==
In 1895, the organizer of UC&#x27;s first football team, Arch Carson, introduced a plan to build a stadium complete with wooden bleachers on the site where Nippert Stadium currently stands. The plans became a reality in 1901 while Carson was serving as UC&#x27;s physical education director. The first game played on the site originally called Varsity Field in Burnet Woods was on November 2, 1901, vs the Ohio University Bobcats. Cincinnati was defeated 16–0 in that contest. They rebounded a week later and defeated Hannover on Varsity field November 9, 1901, 10–0. Although Cincinnati has played home contests in other Cincinnati parks, this site has been the primary home of Cincinnati football since that time. The playing surface at Nippert Stadium is called Carson Field in honor of Arch Carson. Construction of Carson Field began in 1900 and was completed in 1910.

In 1915, construction was completed on the first sections of a brick and concrete structure to replace the wooden stands and continued for several seasons as funds were raised. In 1924, the completed structure was dedicated as James Gamble Nippert Memorial Stadium with a capacity of 12,000.

The field is slightly offset from a conventional north–south alignment, configured north-northeast to south-southwest at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

== Timeline ==

Longtime multimedia rights holder IMG College also contributed to the project.
* 2021 – When FC Cincinnati left for TQL Stadium, new turf was installed in Nippert Stadium.
* 2022 – Additional field level suites installed.

== Renovation history ==
The field was lowered in 1936, allowing capacity to reach 24,000. In 1954, a small upper deck on the East sideline was completed, and named the Reed Shank Pavilion. This increased capacity to 28,000.

In 1992, the stadium was heavily renovated, expanding the upper deck on the East sideline and adding a new Press Box on the West sideline. This increased capacity to 35,097.

In 2005, new gameday locker rooms behind the north end zone (underneath the newly completed Campus Rec Center) were added, as well as a new bigger video board above the north end zone.

=== 2014–2015 renovation and expansion ===

As the UC program rose to prominence in the late 2000s, the small seating capacity of Nippert became an issue. Former UC head coach Brian Kelly called for an expansion of Nippert, the smallest stadium in the Big East Conference. On December 18, 2012, President Santa J. Ono and then Athletic Director Whit Babcock unveiled the long-anticipated plans to update and expand Nippert Stadium. Originally the price tag was estimated at $70 million, but eventually an increased budget of $86 million was announced. On June 25, 2013, the University of Cincinnati Board of Trustees approved the Nippert Stadium Expansion. The West Pavilion now includes a new press box and premium seating area, which will add suites, loge boxes, and club seating. The western concourse also boasts improved general fan amenities, including concession stands, restrooms, and more efficient in-stadium traffic flow. Additions on the east side of the stadium were more sparse, but included additional concession stands, restrooms, and an expansion of the formerly-cramped concourse walkways, due to the addition of skywalks to connect the Herschede-Shank Pavilion with the O&#x27;Varsity Way brick plaza, which is located just outside the stadium.
After renovations, Nippert&#x27;s capacity (including about 2500 SRO) is now around 40,000 (an exact figure hasn&#x27;t yet been put forth by the university). However, local United Soccer League club FC Cincinnati sold out Nippert Stadium in July 2016 after the renovations, and announced a crowd of 35,061. Further, in early 2017 Nippert lost 2,200 seats in a $2 million project expanding the playing field 5 yards in both length and width to accommodate a full-sized soccer field.

The 2014–15 renovation and expansion was designed by the New York-based firm, Architecture Research Office in close collaboration with Heery International. ARO served as the design architect, while Heery served as the sports consultant and executive architect. Construction on the Nippert Stadium expansion started in December 2013, and was completed on time, in September 2015. During the 2014 season, the Bearcats played all of their home games at Paul Brown Stadium, the downtown home of the Cincinnati Bengals.

== Attendance ==
=== Record attendance ===
On October 24, 2015, the Bearcats hosted the UConn Huskies on Homecoming weekend. The crowd on hand was 40,124 making this the second consecutive official sellout in the newly renovated Nippert Stadium.

=== Largest football attendance (since 2000) ===

=== Soccer attendance ===

During FC Cincinnati soccer matches, stadium capacity was limited to 35,061 before 2017 when the field was widened and rows were removed along the sidelines and in the corners to accommodate a regulation width soccer field. Nippert sold out once for a soccer match before the field was widened, when English Premier League club Crystal Palace FC played a friendly against FC Cincinnati on July 16, 2016. Current soccer capacity after rows were removed and once the club reached MLS is 32,250.

=== Largest soccer attendance (pre-MLS) ===
=== Largest soccer attendance (MLS) ===
=== Other soccer attendance ===

On September 15, 2017, the United States women&#x27;s soccer team hosted New Zealand in a friendly before 30,596 fans – a record for the women&#x27;s national team in the state of Ohio.

On June 9, 2019, the United States men&#x27;s soccer team hosted Venezuela in a friendly to prepare for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

== Reception ==
Nippert has earned a reputation as a tough place to play. One national columnist, visiting the sold-out Keg of Nails rivalry game in 2013, described Nippert Stadium as a &quot;quaint bowl of angry noise sitting under the gaze of remarkable architecture&quot; and went on to compare it to a &quot;baby Death Valley&quot; (referring to LSU&#x27;s notoriously intimidating Tiger Stadium). In 2012, USA Today called Nippert Stadium the best football venue in what was then the Big East Conference.

== Other tenants and events hosted ==
The stadium served as home for the American Football League expansion team, the Cincinnati Bengals, in 1968 and 1969, while their eventual permanent home at Riverfront Stadium was being constructed.

The Cincinnati Comets of the American Soccer League played at Nippert in 1973.

The stadium has served as a concert venue at least three times. On July 22, 1973, a show headlined by The Edgar Winter Group with The James Gang and Peter Frampton&#x27;s group, Frampton&#x27;s Camel, drew between 5,000 and 7,000 fans. On July 29, 1973, a concert with Grand Funk Railroad drew 8,000 fans; seventeen were arrested on charges they got in without a ticket. On August 3, 1975, Nippert hosted The Ohio River Rock Festival (Aerosmith, Black Oak Arkansas, Blue Öyster Cult, Foghat, Mahogany Rush, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, REO Speedwagon, and Styx; admission was festival seating/general admission, attendance 32,000 est. according to local radio broadcasts). In addition, the Grateful Dead was supposed to perform at Nippert on June 15, 1973, but the show was canceled, according to the &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot;, due to the fact that the staging was not up to the Dead&#x27;s demands (they eventually played Cincinnati Gardens on December 4, 1973.)
On November 2, 2008, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama held a rally at Nippert two days before the election to an estimated 27,000 attendees.

FC Cincinnati began playing at Nippert in 2016. The team broke the United Soccer League regular-season record for attendance five times, drawing 30,417 fans to its game against New York Red Bulls II on September 16, 2017. They drew 30,187 to their playoff game against the Charleston Battery on October 2, 2016. On September 29, 2018, they once again broke the USL attendance record, drawing 31,478 fans against Indy Eleven in FCC&#x27;s final regular-season home game before the team&#x27;s move to MLS. The team drew 35,061 for a friendly against Crystal Palace F.C. on July 16, 2016. They drew a USL record home opener crowd of 23,144 against Saint Louis FC on April 15, 2017. They drew 33,250 to a U.S. Open Cup semifinal against New York Red Bulls on August 15, 2017.

Nitro Circus performed at Nippert on June 23, 2018.

=== Alternative stadiums ===

UC has used Paycor Stadium, home of the NFL&#x27;s Cincinnati Bengals, as an alternate home field for several high-profile home games. The downtown stadium has a larger seating capacity of 65,535. Games against Ohio State (2002), Oklahoma (2010), and West Virginia (2011) drew crowds of 66,319, 58,253, and 48,152, respectively, at Paycor Stadium.

<doc id="1106818" wikidata="Q5890199" url="?curid=1106818" title="Homer Plessy">
<text>Homer Adolph Plessy (born Homère Patris Plessy; 1858, 1862 or March 17, 1863 – March 1, 1925) was an American shoemaker and activist who was the plaintiff in the United States Supreme Court decision &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;. He staged an act of civil disobedience to challenge one of Louisiana&#x27;s racial segregation laws and bring a test case to force the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of segregation laws. The Court decided against Plessy. The resulting &quot;separate but equal&quot; legal doctrine determined that state-mandated segregation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as long as the facilities provided for both black and white people were putatively &quot;equal&quot;. The legal precedent set by &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; lasted into the mid-20th century, until a series of landmark Supreme Court decisions concerning segregation, beginning with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954.

Plessy was born a free person of color in a family of French-speaking Louisiana Creole people. Growing up during the Reconstruction era, Plessy lived in a society in which black children attended integrated schools, black men could vote, and interracial marriage was legal. However, many of those civil rights were eroded following the withdrawal of U.S. federal troops from the former Confederate States of America in 1877. In the 1880s, Plessy became involved in political activism, and in 1892, the civil rights group Comité des Citoyens recruited him for an act of civil disobedience to challenge Louisiana&#x27;s Separate Car Act, which required separate accommodations for black and white people on railroads. On June 7, 1892, Plessy purchased a ticket for a &quot;whites only&quot; first-class train coach, boarded the train, and was arrested by a private detective hired by the group. Judge John Howard Ferguson ruled against Plessy in a state criminal district court, upholding the law on the grounds that Louisiana had the right to regulate railroads within its borders. Plessy appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard the case four years later in 1896 and ruled 7–1 in favor of Louisiana, establishing the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine as a legal basis for the Jim Crow laws which remained in effect into the 1950s and 1960s.

==Early life and historical context==
Plessy may have been born in 1858, 1862, or on March 17, 1863, under the name Homère Patris Plessy. He was the second of two children in a French-speaking Creole family in New Orleans, Louisiana. Later documents give his name as Homer Adolph Plessy or Homère Adolphe Plessy. His father, a carpenter named Joseph Adolphe Plessy, and his mother, a seamstress named Rosa Debergue, were both mixed-race free people of color. Homer&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Germain Plessy was a white Frenchman born in Bordeaux circa 1777. Germain Plessy lived in the French Saint-Domingue colony, before moving to New Orleans during the 1790s as part of a group of thousands of European settlers who fled the Haitian Revolution. Germain Plessy later lived with Catherine Mathieu, a free woman of color of French and African ancestry, and they had eight children. According to pre-Civil War records, Homer&#x27;s maternal grandparents were both of African descent or mixed race. Many of Homer&#x27;s ancestors and relatives were property-owning tradesmen, including blacksmiths, carpenters, and shoemakers.

Joseph Adolphe Plessy died in 1869. Two years later in 1871, Homer&#x27;s mother married Victor M. Dupart, a clerk for the U.S. Postal Service who supplemented his income by working as a shoemaker. Dupart had six children from a previous marriage; in addition to bringing Homer and his sister Ida to the marriage, Plessy&#x27;s mother had one child with Dupart. Plessy&#x27;s stepfather was politically engaged, having paid poll taxes in 1869 and 1870 in order to vote. He also joined the Unification Movement of 1873, a civil rights movement promoting political equality, racial unity, and an end to discrimination in Reconstruction-era Louisiana.

Keith Medley notes that Plessy grew up in a society in which black people had gained unprecedented civil rights in Louisiana. Beginning in 1868, all black men could vote if they paid a poll tax. The state implemented a racially integrated school system in 1869. The state legislature legalized interracial marriage in 1868. And more than 200 black men held elected offices at the state and local levels in the 1870s. However, Medley writes that many of those gains eroded following the withdrawal of U.S. federal troops from the former Confederacy in 1877. When white Democrats returned to power in the late 1870s, they began to defund public education for black people.

Plessy worked as a shoemaker and may have also done carpentry, according to a relative. During the 1880s, he worked at Patricio Brito&#x27;s shoe-making business in New Orleans&#x27;s French Quarter. He married nineteen-year-old Louise Bordenave at St. Augustine Church on July 14, 1888; Brito served as a witness. In 1889, he and his wife moved to Faubourg Tremé, a racially integrated middle-class neighborhood of New Orleans at the time, and he registered to vote in the Sixth Ward&#x27;s Third Precinct. He was also a freemason.

Medley writes that Plessy&#x27;s political involvement began in the post-Reconstruction 1880s. In 1887, he served as vice-president of the fifty-person Justice, Protective, Educational, and Social Club, a group dedicated to reforming public education in New Orleans. Not only had Louisiana abolished racially integrated schools in 1879, but many of the public schools in New Orleans were unable to stay open in the 1880s due to a lack of funding. In response, the organization published a pamphlet declaring its intention to collect and build a community library and appealing to the Louisiana state government for &quot;our fair share of public education&quot; with safeguards against &quot;fraud and manipulation, thereby insuring [sic] good teachers, a full term and all necessary articles for the maintenance of schools, which at this moment we have not.&quot;

There is no known photograph of Homer Plessy, though a photograph of P. B. S. Pinchback, a former governor of Louisiana, has been misattributed as Plessy.

==&quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;==
===Orchestrating a test case===
In 1890, the State of Louisiana passed the Separate Car Act, which required separate accommodation for black and white people on railroads, including separate railway cars. A group of 18 prominent black, creole of color, and white creole New Orleans residents formed the Comité des Citoyens (Committee of Citizens) to challenge the law. Many staff members of &quot;The New Orleans Crusader&quot;, a black Republican newspaper, were among the group&#x27;s members, including publisher Louis A. Martinet, writer Rodolphe Desdunes, and managing editor L. J. Joubert, who served as president of the Justice, Protective, Educational, and Social Club at the same time Plessy was vice president.

The group contacted attorney and civil rights advocate Albion W. Tourgée, who agreed to help them bring a test case to court in order to force the judiciary to determine the constitutionality of Jim Crow laws. In his correspondence with Martinet, Tourgée suggested finding a plaintiff who had &quot;not more than one-eight colored blood&quot; and could pass as white. The attorney hoped that by selecting a person of ambiguous racial identity, he might exploit the Louisiana legislature&#x27;s failure to define race and to force the court to consider the inconclusiveness of scientific evidence on definitive racial categories. In court, he later argued that a man of one-eighth African ancestry may not even know to which race he belongs, so a railroad employee would be even less qualified to &quot;decide the question of race&quot; and determine in what car a mixed-race individual ought to sit.

Tourgée also suggested finding a female plaintiff, because he believed the courts might be more sympathetic to a woman being ejected from a railroad car. However, the Comité des Citoyens instead recruited musician Daniel Desdunes, the son of group member Rodolphe Desdunes. Martinet contacted several railroad companies to inform them of the group&#x27;s intentions. The railroads overwhelmingly opposed the Separate Car Act because it raised their operating costs by forcing them to use additional cars that might only be at half capacity. Some companies enforced the law, while others did not. Martinet eventually enlisted the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company to participate in the group&#x27;s plan. On February 24, 1892, Daniel Desdunes purchased a first-class ticket on a train bound for Mobile, Alabama. After he sat in a &quot;whites only&quot; car, the conductor stopped the train, and a private detective hired by the Comité des Citoyens arrested Desdunes. The prosecution dropped their case against Desdunes in May 1892, however, after the Louisiana State Supreme Court ruled that the Separate Car Act did not apply to interstate railroad trips.

In order to bring their test case to court, the Comité des Citoyens had to stage another incident on a train trip entirely within Louisiana state lines. They recruited Plessy, who may have been a friend of Rodolphe Desdunes, to be the plaintiff. Martinet contacted the East Louisiana Railroad, one of the companies that opposed the law, and declared their intentions to stage an act of civil disobedience. He also hired the services of private detective Chris C. Cain to arrest Plessy and ensure that he was charged with violating the Separate Car Act and not with a misdemeanor such as disturbing the peace.

On June 7, 1892, Plessy bought a first-class ticket on the East Louisiana Railroad running between the Press Street Depot in New Orleans and Covington, Louisiana, an approximately 30-mile journey that would have taken two hours. He sat in the &quot;whites only&quot; passenger car. When conductor J. J. Dowling, who was also in on the staged act, came to collect Plessy&#x27;s ticket, he told Plessy to leave the &quot;whites only&quot; car. Plessy refused. The conductor stopped the train, walked back to the depot, and returned with Detective Cain. Cain and other passengers forcibly removed Plessy from the train. Cain then arrested Plessy and took him to the Orleans Parish jail. The Comité des Citoyens arrived at the jail, arranged for him to be released, and paid his $500 bond the following day by offering up a committee member&#x27;s house as collateral.

===Trial===
On October 28, 1892, Plessy was arraigned before Judge John Howard Ferguson in the Orleans Parish criminal district court. He was represented by New Orleans lawyer James Walker, who submitted a plea challenging the jurisdiction of trial court by claiming that the Separate Car Act violated the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution, which provided for equal protection under the law and &quot;impermissibly clothed train officers with the authority and duty to assign passengers on the basis of race and with the authority to refuse service.&quot; Walker&#x27;s plea deliberately did not specify if Plessy was black or white. On November 18, Ferguson denied Walker&#x27;s petition, stating that Louisiana had the right to regulate railroad companies while they operated within state boundaries. Four days later, Walker petitioned the Louisiana Supreme Court for a writ of prohibition to stop the trial.

In December 1892, the Louisiana Supreme Court&#x27;s five members unanimously upheld Ferguson&#x27;s ruling, citing two cases from Northern states as precedents: &quot;Roberts v. City of Boston&quot;, an 1849 Massachusetts Supreme Court decision, ruling that racial segregation of schools was constitutional, and an 1867 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that upheld railroads&#x27; rights to seat black and white passengers in separate sections of passenger cars. The court denied Walker&#x27;s subsequent request for a rehearing.

=== Supreme Court appeal ===
On January 5, 1893, Walker applied for a writ of error, which the United States Supreme Court accepted. Tourgée would represent Plessy before the Supreme Court and enlisted the aid of former Solicitor General Samuel F. Phillips as co-counsel. The case first appeared on the docket in January 1893, but Tourgée wrote to the Comité des Citoyens voicing his concerns that they would lose. In the three years since the Comité des Citoyens first organized, the court&#x27;s makeup had changed under the administration of President Benjamin Harrison and had taken on a more segregationist tilt. He hoped that unsympathetic justices would change their minds with time or retire, writing in one letter: &quot;The Court has always been the foe of liberty until forced to move on by public opinion.&quot; In the 1890s, a case could take several years to appear before the Supreme Court, and Plessy&#x27;s lawyers hoped to delay until close to the 1896 United States presidential election, in the hopes the election might influence the outcome in their favor. However, the court called the case in spring 1896, and the oral arguments of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; were held on April 13. Tourgée argued that the State of Louisiana had violated the Thirteenth Amendment that abolished slavery, and the Fourteenth Amendment that stated, &quot;no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, and property without due process of law.&quot; He also argued that segregation laws inherently implied that black people were inferior, and therefore stigmatized them with a second-class status that violated the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause, which reads: &quot;nor shall any State ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot;

On May 18, 1896, the Supreme Court issued a 7–1 decision against Plessy that upheld the constitutionality of Louisiana&#x27;s train car segregation laws. Justice Henry Billings Brown delivered the majority opinion, first dismissing any claim that the Louisiana law violated the Thirteenth Amendment, which, in the majority&#x27;s opinion, did no more than ensure that black Americans had the basic level of legal equality needed to abolish slavery. Next, the Court considered whether the law violated the Equal Protection Clause, concluding that although the Fourteenth Amendment was meant to guarantee legal equality of all races in America, it was not intended to prevent social or other types of discrimination.

The Court also rejected Tourgée&#x27;s argument that segregation laws marked black Americans with &quot;a badge of inferiority,&quot; and said that racial prejudice could not be overcome by legislation.

Brown&#x27;s opinion ended with a note on the subject of Plessy&#x27;s racial identity under the law. He wrote that while the question of whether Plessy was legally black or white may have bearing on the outcome of the criminal case, legal definitions of racial categories were an issue of state law not before the U.S. Supreme Court. Ultimately, Brown deferred to Louisiana law to determine whether Plessy was legally black or white.

==Later life==

After the Supreme Court ruling, Plessy&#x27;s criminal trial went ahead in Ferguson&#x27;s court in Louisiana on February 11, 1897. He pleaded guilty of violating the Separate Car Act, which carried a punishment of a $25 fine or twenty days in jail. He opted to pay the fine. The Comité des Citoyens disbanded shortly after the trial&#x27;s end.

The shoemaking profession declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to large-scale industrial production, so Plessy later took jobs as a laborer, warehouseman, clerk, and insurance premium collector for the black-owned People&#x27;s Life Insurance Company. He died on March 1, 1925, in New Orleans. His obituary read: &quot;Homer Plessy — on Sunday, March 1, 1925, at 5:10 a.m. beloved husband of Louise Bordenave.&quot; He was interred in the Debergue-Blanco family tomb in Saint Louis Cemetery No. 1 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Legacy==

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; created the &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; legal doctrine, allowing state-sponsored racial segregation. The Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; overturned the doctrine in 1954. Though the &quot;Plessy&quot; case did not involve education, it formed the legal basis of separate school systems for the following fifty-eight years.

In 2009, Keith Plessy and Phoebe Ferguson, relatives of Plessy and Ferguson, respectively, created the Plessy and Ferguson Foundation for Education and Reconciliation. The foundation placed a historical marker at the corner of Press and Royal Streets in New Orleans, near the site of Homer Plessy&#x27;s arrest. A portion of Press Street was renamed after Plessy in 2018.

On January 5, 2022, Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards granted Plessy a posthumous pardon. The pardon was issued in accordance with &quot;The Avery C. Alexander Act. This 2006 act was passed by the Louisiana Legislature to expedite the pardon process for individuals who were criminalized and convicted under Louisiana laws created for the purpose of maintaining or enforcing racial separation or discrimination of individuals.

<text>USS &quot;Sea Dog&quot; (SS-401/AGSS-401) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine in the United States Navy. She was the first ship to be named for the dogfish, a small shark of the North Atlantic, considered destructive by fishermen.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; was laid down on 1 November 1943 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 28 March 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Claire Dowden Lowrance, wife of the prospective commanding officer, and commissioned on 3 June 1944 with Commander Vernon L. Lowrance in command.

Following a month&#x27;s training off the New England coast, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor to join Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 28 and prepare for her first war patrol. Arriving in Hawaii on 22 August, she sailed west on 13 September, topped off at Midway Island on 17 September; and entered her patrol area in the Nansei Shoto on 28 September.

== First War Patrol ==

With daylight traffic routed well inshore, she hunted unsuccessfully in the Kikaijima, Amami O Shima, and Okinoerabujima areas for the first few days, then searched the likely traffic lanes to Naha and Unten Ko. By 3 October, she had rounded Okinawa to patrol in the approaches to Nakagusuku Wan, and, by 6 October, she was again northwest of Okinawa in the Iheya Jima area.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; remained west of Okinawa for another five days but found no targets worthy of a torpedo. On 10 October, however, she took an armed trawler under fire and left it burning.

On 11 October, she headed back into the Amami Gunto. A week later, she moved north into the Tokara Gunto and, on 22 October, while between the islands of Suwanosejima and Nakanoshima (Kagoshima), she sighted a convoy making eight to nine knots and zigging every five minutes.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; moved ahead of the port column and, at 0726, fired as two cargo ships overlapped in a zig. A minute later, she lost depth control and dropped to . Shortly after 0728, three loud explosions were heard. At 0732, the convoy&#x27;s escorts began dropping depth charges. At 0745, breaking up noises were heard; and, at 0800, there was a dull, heavy explosion. Converted gun boat &quot;Tomitsu Maru&quot; and collier &quot;Muroto&quot; had been sunk. Depth charging continued for another two hours. In total, Japanese escorts and aircraft fired 109 depth charges at the &quot;Sea Dog&quot;, but LtCdr. Lowrance manages to evade the attack.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; continued to patrol in the Tokara Gunto for another two days, then headed back to the Amami Gunto. On 28 October, she contacted and attacked, unsuccessfully, a formation of two battleships and a destroyer; and, on 29 October, she set an eastward course for Midway. On 30 October, she patrolled in the likely traffic lanes to the Bonin Islands, and, on 5 November, she reached Midway.

== Second War Patrol ==

Refitted by submarine tender , &quot;Sea Dog&quot; got underway again on 29 November. On 1 December, she rendezvoused with submarines and to form a coordinated attack group with the commanding officer of &quot;Sea Dog&quot; in charge of the wolfpack. On 8 December, the group stopped off at Saipan; and the next day headed west. On 14 December, the ships arrived on station in Balintang Channel to begin their patrol in the South China Sea.

The next 34 days were spent on station patrolling a trapezium-shaped area with Luzon, Hainan, Hong Kong and Formosa as the corners. On 3 January 1945, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; interrupted her hunting to repair her port reduction gear, without which she was limited to single shaft operations. On the night of 5 January, she and &quot;Sea Robin&quot; made contact with a small convoy and, despite heavy seas, commenced a surface approach. Shortly after 0100 on 6 January, &quot;Sea Robin&quot; attacked the lead ships and scored two hits. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; stalked the right rear ship, a converted escort. The target, however, foiled an attempt at a bow shot by reversing course. Further maneuvers for a stern tube attack were frustrated when the converted escort presented a zero angle on the bow and opened fire with her forward gun, estimated to be a three-inch. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; fired four &quot;down-the-throat&quot; and retired. No hits were scored.

On 18 January, the submarines closed Luzon Strait in hopes of sighting targets before leaving the area. Unsuccessful, they continued east. On 25 January, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; reached Guam, whence she continued on to Pearl Harbor.

Arriving on 5 February, &quot;Sea Dog&quot;&#x27;s main engines were overhauled; the 40 millimeter gun was installed in a high position forward; and ST radar equipment was added. On 11 March, she got underway to return to Japanese waters.

== Third War Patrol ==

Assigned to patrol immediately south of the home islands, she spent 29 days in the area, with most of that time taken up in providing lifeguard services for aircraft strikes. From 22 to 24 March, she was on lifeguard duty to the southeast of the Nanpō Islands. On 25 March, she moved into that chain and, on 28 March she closed the Kyūshū coast off Cape Toi. The next day, lifeguard duty took her on a high speed run south to the Osumi Islands, where sea planes picked up the downed pilots as she arrived. A short while later, however, a third plane circled, then ditched eight miles off. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; picked up the pilot, submerged, and headed back to the Kyūshū coast.

At 1903, as she was making preparations to surface, she sighted an enemy I-boat which had just surfaced. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; took the offensive and fired on the submarine but not fast enough. The torpedoes missed, and the I-boat escaped.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; remained off the Kyūshū coast for another day; then moved north to lifeguard duty south of Sagami Wan. Although assigned to cover both sides of the Izu Shoto, resulting in much of her time being spent on high speed runs south around Mikura-jima with no rescues being made at the end of the runs, potential target opportunities increased. On 2 April, she sighted and fired on a small minelayer. All torpedoes missed. On 16 April, she sank a medium-sized cargo ship, &quot;Toko Maru&quot;, between Hachijo Jima and Mikura-jima. A typhoon then interrupted both hunting and rescue operations; and, on 23 April, she headed for Guam.

== Fourth War Patrol ==

Refit took &quot;Sea Dog&quot; into May, when preparations were made for her last foray into Japanese home waters. Additional duties during the patrol included those of flagship for the nine-submarine Japan Sea Patrol Pack (TC 17.21). On 27 May, she departed Guam with the other two submarines of her immediate pack,
 and .
Later that day, the ships separated to proceed independently, planning to rendezvous on 4 June. On 28 May, one of &quot;Sea Dog&quot;&#x27;s crew became seriously ill and was diagnosed as a possible pneumonia case. On 29 May, the submarine rendezvoused with and, after transferring the patient to that destroyer, continued on to the Sea of Japan.

On arrival, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; reconnoitered the approaches to western Honshū ports to locate minefields; then took up station off the east coast of Sado Island. At 2000 on 9 June, she sank her first target of the patrol, the small cargo ship, &quot;Sagawa Maru&quot;. Twenty-three minutes later, she made her second contact; and, at 2044, she fired three torpedoes at another merchant ship, the &quot;Shoyo Maru&quot;. One torpedo hit, starting a fire aft. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; pulled away, watched, then moved in for the &quot;coup de grace&quot;. Two more torpedoes were fired, one ran erratic; the second hit amidships. The target exploded; her bow broke off; and her stern assumed a 60-degree down angle.

Soon afterward, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; cleared the Niigata area and headed north to patrol off Sakata and Akita. On 10 June, she closed Oga Hanto, and that night she patrolled northwest of Kisakata and northeast of Tobishima, Minato Island. On 11 June, she returned to the vicinity of Oga Hanto. Shortly after 1300, she made contact with another coastal freighter, surfaced, and commenced running west and north to intercept. At 1519, she dived. At 1555, she fired one torpedo. Forty-three seconds later, the torpedo hit; and the target, cargo ship &quot;Kofuku Maru&quot;, broke in two, up-ending both the bow and the stern.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; resumed her patrol to the southward. That night, she took up station to the north of Nyudozaki and, at 0635 on 12 June, sighted a small convoy as it rounded that headland and continued northward, through relatively shallow waters, toward Henashi Zaki. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; fired on the freighter farthest from the coast. &quot;Shinson Maru&quot; broke in two and sank in about two minutes. Her companions moved even closer to the coast. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; headed for deeper water and patrolled to the southwest.

On 13 June, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; was still off Oga Hanto. That evening, the starboard mine clearing cable, installed during the previous refit at Guam, parted and fouled the starboard screw. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; cleared the Japanese coast and stopped, lying-to while attempts were made to get divers down. Leaks in the face mask of the shallow water diving outfit, however, proved impossible to repair; and, soon after 0130 on 14 June, the submarine got underway. The noise and vibration from the starboard shaft was found to occur only for short periods at low speeds. At high speeds, its performance was satisfactory, and &quot;Sea Dog&quot; resumed her patrol, setting a southwest course for a surface patrol across the approaches to Akita, Sakata, and Niigata.

With daylight on 14 June, she dived, stopped her starboard propeller, and commenced hunting underwater. Less than an hour later, she sighted smoke and attempted to intercept. Her quarry, two cargo ships beat her into Sakata. That night, she moved northward again, and, at 0510 on 15 June, she sighted a passenger/cargo ship standing south past the northern end of Oga Hanto. At 0522, she fired a torpedo which hit just forward of amidships. &quot;Koan Maru&quot; sank in four minutes. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; cleared the area as small craft from the beach moved out to pick up survivors.

On 17 June, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; rotated areas with &quot;Spadefish&quot; and &quot;Crevalle&quot; and headed north to hunt along the Hokkaidō coast between Bakkai and Kamui Misaki. Two days later, she sighted three merchantmen moving northward along the coast and attacked, firing two torpedoes at the lead ship and three at the second. The third ship changed course. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; turned back to the previous targets. The first ship, cargo ship &quot;Kokai Maru&quot;, was going under, stern first. But, before she could fire again on the second ship, an enemy plane was sighted. &quot;Sea Dog&quot; dived. At , she grounded; backed off, cleared and then headed north. The plane did not attack.

SS-401 remained in the area for several more days, then headed for Pearl Harbor. On 30 June, she arrived at Midway; and, on 5 July, she entered Pearl Harbor.

== Fifth War Patrol ==

On 13 August, she departed that port for her fifth war patrol. On 14 August, she received orders to cease hostilities; and, on 15 August, she reversed course for Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands during the remainder of August. On 6 September, she headed west with , , and ; and, on 26 September, she arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, to join the newly formed postwar squadron, SubRon 5.

== Post-War Duties ==

For the next three and one-half months, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; operated out of Subic Bay and, on 12 January 1946, set a course for the West Coast, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 2 February. Overhaul at Mare Island followed; and, in June, she returned to Pearl Harbor to prepare for her second postwar deployment to the Far East. During July, while en route to the Philippines, she conducted a mock war patrol. In August and early September, she provided antisubmarine training services to Seventh Fleet units in the Tsingtao area; and, at the end of the latter month, she returned to Pearl Harbor.

Through 1947, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; remained in the eastern Pacific, conducting training operations in the Hawaiian Islands and off the coasts of Washington, British Columbia, and California. In mid-January 1948, she again deployed to the western Pacific Ocean, where, after a visit to Australia, she again joined TG 71.2, the 7th Fleet&#x27;s antisubmarine warfare training group at Tsingtao. On 2 March, she suffered minor damage in a collision with ; and, after repairs, she headed back to Hawaii.

Two months later, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; cleared Pearl Harbor and headed north to the Bering Sea to collect hydrographic and oceanographic information. On her return to Pearl Harbor, 15 June, she resumed a schedule of local training exercises alternated with periods of antisubmarine warfare training services to Fleet Air Wing 4 off the Washington coast.

In January 1950, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; was again deployed to the western Pacific. On her return, she received orders to join the Atlantic Fleet. Departing Pearl Harbor in mid-June, she arrived at Norfolk in early July and commenced training services necessitated by the outbreak of the Korean War. In July 1952, &quot;Sea Dog&quot; was reassigned to SubRon 12 at Key West, Florida, whence she continued to provide training services.

On 7 November 1952, while conducting exercises with Airship Squadron 2 off Jacksonville, Florida, she intercepted a distress signal from a damaged U.S. Navy blimp, &quot;K-119&quot;, commanded by then-Lieutenant G. Robert Keiser, USN, and proceeded at flank speed to the last reported position to pick up Keiser and 2 other survivors, the co-pilot and navigator, for further transfer to the rescue and salvage ship USS &quot;Escape&quot; (ARS-6). The blimp itself, however, proved too waterlogged to be towed back to port and was taken under fire by &quot;Sea Dog&quot;. The gas tanks were penetrated, and the burning blimp sank.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; remained based at Key West into the fall of 1955 when she was ordered to New London, Connecticut, to begin inactivation at Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London. Arriving early in December, she proceeded to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine for overhaul in January 1956; and, in May, she returned to New London, where she was decommissioned on 27 June. She remained in the New London Reserve Group until partially activated in February 1960 for service as a Naval Reserve training ship in the 1st Naval District. She served in that capacity until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 December 1968. She was docked in Salem, Massachusetts as a floating museum until 1973 when she was sold for scrap.

&quot;Sea Dog&quot; earned two battle stars during World War II.

As of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has carried this name.

<text>Cell culture or tissue culture is the process by which cells are grown under controlled conditions, generally outside of their natural environment. After cells of interest have been isolated from living tissue, they can subsequently be maintained under carefully controlled conditions. They need to be kept at body temperature (37 °C) in an incubator. These conditions vary for each cell type, but generally consist of a suitable vessel with a substrate or rich medium that supplies the essential nutrients (amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals), growth factors, hormones, and gases (CO2, O2), and regulates the physio-chemical environment (pH buffer, osmotic pressure, temperature). Most cells require a surface or an artificial substrate to form an adherent culture as a monolayer (one single-cell thick), whereas others can be grown free floating in a medium as a suspension culture. This is typically facilitated via use of a liquid, semi-solid, or solid growth medium, such as broth or agar. Tissue culture commonly refers to the culture of animal cells and tissues, with the more specific term &quot;plant tissue culture&quot; being used for plants. The lifespan of most cells is genetically determined, but some cell-culturing cells have been &#x27;transformed&#x27; into immortal cells which will reproduce indefinitely if the optimal conditions are provided.

In practice, the term &quot;cell culture&quot; now refers to the culturing of cells derived from multicellular eukaryotes, especially animal cells, in contrast with other types of culture that also grow cells, such as plant tissue culture, fungal culture, and microbiological culture (of microbes). The historical development and methods of cell culture are closely interrelated with those of tissue culture and organ culture. Viral culture is also related, with cells as hosts for the viruses.

The laboratory technique of maintaining live cell lines (a population of cells descended from a single cell and containing the same genetic makeup) separated from their original tissue source became more robust in the middle 20th century.

==History==

The 19th-century English physiologist Sydney Ringer developed salt solutions containing the chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium suitable for maintaining the beating of an isolated animal heart outside the body. In 1885 Wilhelm Roux removed a section of the medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and maintained it in a warm saline solution for several days, establishing the basic principle of tissue culture. In 1907 the zoologist Ross Granville Harrison demonstrated the growth of frog embryonic cells that would give rise to nerve cells in a medium of clotted lymph. In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1996, the first use of regenerative tissue was used to replace a small length of urethra, which led to the understanding that the technique of obtaining samples of tissue, growing it outside the body without a scaffold, and reapplying it, can be used for only small distances of less than 1 cm. Ross Granville Harrison, working at Johns Hopkins Medical School and then at Yale University, published results of his experiments from 1907 to 1910, establishing the methodology of tissue culture.

Gottlieb Haberlandt first pointed out the possibilities of the culture of isolated tissues, plant tissue culture. He suggested that the potentialities of individual cells via tissue culture as well as that the reciprocal influences of tissues on one another could be determined by this method. Since Haberlandt&#x27;s original assertions, methods for tissue and cell culture have been realized, leading to significant discoveries in biology and medicine. He presented his original idea of &quot;totipotentiality&quot; in 1902, stating that &quot;Theoretically all plant cells are able to give rise to a complete plant.&quot; The term &quot;tissue culture&quot; was coined by American pathologist Montrose Thomas Burrows.

Cell culture techniques were advanced significantly in the 1940s and 1950s to support research in virology. Growing viruses in cell cultures allowed preparation of purified viruses for the manufacture of vaccines. The injectable polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk was one of the first products mass-produced using cell culture techniques. This vaccine was made possible by the cell culture research of John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller, and Frederick Chapman Robbins, who were awarded a Nobel Prize for their discovery of a method of growing the virus in monkey kidney cell cultures. Cell culture has contributed to the development of vaccines for many diseases.

== Modern usage ==

In modern usage, &quot;tissue culture&quot; generally refers to the growth of cells from a tissue from a multicellular organism &quot;in vitro&quot;. These cells may be cells isolated from a donor organism (primary cells) or an immortalised cell line. The cells are bathed in a culture medium, which contains essential nutrients and energy sources necessary for the cells&#x27; survival. Thus, in its broader sense, &quot;tissue culture&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;cell culture&quot;. On the other hand, the strict meaning of &quot;tissue culture&quot; refers to the culturing of tissue pieces, i.e. explant culture.

Tissue culture is an important tool for the study of the biology of cells from multicellular organisms. It provides an &quot;in vitro&quot; model of the tissue in a well defined environment which can be easily manipulated and analysed. In animal tissue culture, cells may be grown as two-dimensional monolayers (conventional culture) or within fibrous scaffolds or gels to attain more naturalistic three-dimensional tissue-like structures (3D culture). A 1988 NIH SBIR grant report showed that electrospinning could be used to produce nano- and submicron-scale polymeric fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for use as &quot;in vitro&quot; cell and tissue substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed of tissues &quot;in vivo&quot;.

Plant tissue culture in particular is concerned with the growing of entire plants from small pieces of plant tissue, cultured in medium.

== Concepts in mammalian cell culture ==

===Isolation of cells===
Cells can be isolated from tissues for &quot;ex vivo&quot; culture in several ways. Cells can be easily purified from blood; however, only the white cells are capable of growth in culture. Cells can be isolated from solid tissues by digesting the extracellular matrix using enzymes such as collagenase, trypsin, or pronase, before agitating the tissue to release the cells into suspension. Alternatively, pieces of tissue can be placed in growth media, and the cells that grow out are available for culture. This method is known as explant culture.

Cells that are cultured directly from a subject are known as primary cells. With the exception of some derived from tumors, most primary cell cultures have limited lifespan.

An established or immortalized cell line has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely either through random mutation or deliberate modification, such as artificial expression of the telomerase gene.
Numerous cell lines are well established as representative of particular cell types.

===Maintaining cells in culture===
For the majority of isolated primary cells, they undergo the process of senescence and stop dividing after a certain number of population doublings while generally retaining their viability (described as the Hayflick limit).
Aside from temperature and gas mixture, the most commonly varied factor in culture systems is the cell growth medium. Recipes for growth media can vary in pH, glucose concentration, growth factors, and the presence of other nutrients. The growth factors used to supplement media are often derived from the serum of animal blood, such as fetal bovine serum (FBS), bovine calf serum, equine serum, and porcine serum. One complication of these blood-derived ingredients is the potential for contamination of the culture with viruses or prions, particularly in medical biotechnology applications. Current practice is to minimize or eliminate the use of these ingredients wherever possible and use human platelet lysate (hPL). This eliminates the worry of cross-species contamination when using FBS with human cells. hPL has emerged as a safe and reliable alternative as a direct replacement for FBS or other animal serum. In addition, chemically defined media can be used to eliminate any serum trace (human or animal), but this cannot always be accomplished with different cell types. Alternative strategies involve sourcing the animal blood from countries with minimum BSE/TSE risk, such as The United States, Australia and New Zealand, and using purified nutrient concentrates derived from serum in place of whole animal serum for cell culture.

Plating density (number of cells per volume of culture medium) plays a critical role for some cell types. For example, a lower plating density makes granulosa cells exhibit estrogen production, while a higher plating density makes them appear as progesterone-producing theca lutein cells.

Cells can be grown either in suspension or adherent cultures. Some cells naturally live in suspension, without being attached to a surface, such as cells that exist in the bloodstream. There are also cell lines that have been modified to be able to survive in suspension cultures so they can be grown to a higher density than adherent conditions would allow. Adherent cells require a surface, such as tissue culture plastic or microcarrier, which may be coated with extracellular matrix (such as collagen and laminin) components to increase adhesion properties and provide other signals needed for growth and differentiation. Most cells derived from solid tissues are adherent. Another type of adherent culture is organotypic culture, which involves growing cells in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment as opposed to two-dimensional culture dishes. This 3D culture system is biochemically and physiologically more similar to &quot;in vivo&quot; tissue, but is technically challenging to maintain because of many factors (e.g. diffusion).

====Cell culture basal media====
There are different kinds of cell culture media which being used routinely in life science including the following:
* MEM
* DMEM
* RPMI 1640
* Ham&#x27;s f-12
* IMDM
* Leibovitz L-15
* DMEM/F-12
* GMEM

=== Components of cell culture media ===
==== Typical Growth conditions ====
===Cell line cross-contamination===

Cell line cross-contamination can be a problem for scientists working with cultured cells. Studies suggest anywhere from 15 to 20% of the time, cells used in experiments have been misidentified or contaminated with another cell line. Problems with cell line cross-contamination have even been detected in lines from the NCI-60 panel, which are used routinely for drug-screening studies. Major cell line repositories, including the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) and the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), have received cell line submissions from researchers that were misidentified by them. Such contamination poses a problem for the quality of research produced using cell culture lines, and the major repositories are now authenticating all cell line submissions. ATCC uses short tandem repeat (STR) DNA fingerprinting to authenticate its cell lines.

To address this problem of cell line cross-contamination, researchers are encouraged to authenticate their cell lines at an early passage to establish the identity of the cell line. Authentication should be repeated before freezing cell line stocks, every two months during active culturing and before any publication of research data generated using the cell lines. Many methods are used to identify cell lines, including isoenzyme analysis, human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) typing, chromosomal analysis, karyotyping, morphology and STR analysis.

One significant cell-line cross contaminant is the immortal HeLa cell line. HeLa contamination was first noted in the early 1960s in non-human culture in the USA. Intraspecies contamination was discovered in nineteen cell lines in the seventies. In 1974, five human cell lines from the Soviet Union were found to be HeLa. A follow-up study analysing 50-odd cell lines indicated that half had HeLa markers, but contaminant HeLa had hybridised with the original cell lines. HeLa cell contamination from air droplets has been reported. HeLa was even unknowingly injected into human subjects by Jonas Salk in a 1978 vaccine trial.

===Other technical issues===
As cells generally continue to divide in culture, they generally grow to fill the available area or volume. This can generate several issues:
* Nutrient depletion in the growth media
* Changes in pH of the growth media
* Accumulation of apoptotic/necrotic (dead) cells
* Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate cell cycle arrest, causing cells to stop dividing, known as contact inhibition.
* Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate cellular differentiation.
* Genetic and epigenetic alterations, with a natural selection of the altered cells potentially leading to overgrowth of abnormal, culture-adapted cells with decreased differentiation and increased proliferative capacity.

The choice of culture medium might affect the physiological relevance of findings from cell culture experiments due to the differences in the nutrient composition and concentrations. A systematic bias in generated datasets was recently shown for CRISPR and RNAi gene silencing screens, and for metabolic profiling of cancer cell lines. Using a growth medium that better represents the physiological levels of nutrients can improve the physiological relevance of in vitro studies and recently such media types, as Plasmax and Human Plasma Like Medium (HPLM), were developed.

===Manipulation of cultured cells===
Among the common manipulations carried out on culture cells are media changes, passaging cells, and transfecting cells.
These are generally performed using tissue culture methods that rely on aseptic technique. Aseptic technique aims to avoid contamination with bacteria, yeast, or other cell lines. Manipulations are typically carried out in a biosafety cabinet or laminar flow cabinet to exclude contaminating micro-organisms. Antibiotics (e.g. penicillin and streptomycin) and antifungals (e.g.amphotericin B and Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution) can also be added to the growth media.

As cells undergo metabolic processes, acid is produced and the pH decreases. Often, a pH indicator is added to the medium to measure nutrient depletion.

====Media changes====
In the case of adherent cultures, the media can be removed directly by aspiration, and then is replaced. Media changes in non-adherent cultures involve centrifuging the culture and resuspending the cells in fresh media.

====Passaging cells====

Passaging (also known as subculture or splitting cells) involves transferring a small number of cells into a new vessel. Cells can be cultured for a longer time if they are split regularly, as it avoids the senescence associated with prolonged high cell density. Suspension cultures are easily passaged with a small amount of culture containing a few cells diluted in a larger volume of fresh media. For adherent cultures, cells first need to be detached; this is commonly done with a mixture of trypsin-EDTA; however, other enzyme mixes are now available for this purpose. A small number of detached cells can then be used to seed a new culture. Some cell cultures, such as RAW cells are mechanically scraped from the surface of their vessel with rubber scrapers.

====Transfection and transduction====

Another common method for manipulating cells involves the introduction of foreign DNA by transfection. This is often performed to cause cells to express a gene of interest. More recently, the transfection of RNAi constructs have been realized as a convenient mechanism for suppressing the expression of a particular gene/protein. DNA can also be inserted into cells using viruses, in methods referred to as transduction, infection or transformation. Viruses, as parasitic agents, are well suited to introducing DNA into cells, as this is a part of their normal course of reproduction.

===Established human cell lines===

Cell lines that originate with humans have been somewhat controversial in bioethics, as they may outlive their parent organism and later be used in the discovery of lucrative medical treatments. In the pioneering decision in this area, the Supreme Court of California held in &quot;Moore v. Regents of the University of California&quot; that human patients have no property rights in cell lines derived from organs removed with their consent.
It is possible to fuse normal cells with an immortalised cell line. This method is used to produce monoclonal antibodies. In brief, lymphocytes isolated from the spleen (or possibly blood) of an immunised animal are combined with an immortal myeloma cell line (B cell lineage) to produce a hybridoma which has the antibody specificity of the primary lymphocyte and the immortality of the myeloma. Selective growth medium (HA or HAT) is used to select against unfused myeloma cells; primary lymphoctyes die quickly in culture and only the fused cells survive. These are screened for production of the required antibody, generally in pools to start with and then after single cloning.

===Cell strains===
A cell strain is derived either from a primary culture or a cell line by the selection or cloning of cells having specific properties or characteristics which must be defined. Cell strains are cells that have been adapted to culture but, unlike cell lines, have a finite division potential. Non-immortalized cells stop dividing after 40 to 60 population doublings and, after this, they lose their ability to proliferate (a genetically determined event known as senescence).

==Applications of cell culture==
Mass culture of animal cell lines is fundamental to the manufacture of viral vaccines and other products of biotechnology. Culture of human stem cells is used to expand the number of cells and differentiate the cells into various somatic cell types for transplantation. Stem cell culture is also used to harvest the molecules and exosomes that the stem cells release for the purposes of therapeutic development.

Biological products produced by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology in animal cell cultures include enzymes, synthetic hormones, immunobiologicals (monoclonal antibodies, interleukins, lymphokines), and anticancer agents. Although many simpler proteins can be produced using rDNA in bacterial cultures, more complex proteins that are glycosylated (carbohydrate-modified) currently must be made in animal cells. Mammalian cells ensure expressed proteins are folded correctly and possess human-like glycosylation and post-translational modifications. An important example of such a complex protein is the hormone erythropoietin. The cost of growing mammalian cell cultures is high, so research is underway to produce such complex proteins in insect cells or in higher plants, use of single embryonic cell and somatic embryos as a source for direct gene transfer via particle bombardment, transit gene expression and confocal microscopy observation is one of its applications. It also offers to confirm single cell origin of somatic embryos and the asymmetry of the first cell division, which starts the process.

Cell culture is also a key technique for cellular agriculture, which aims to provide both new products and new ways of producing existing agricultural products like milk, (cultured) meat, fragrances, and rhino horn from cells and microorganisms. It is therefore considered one means of achieving animal-free agriculture. It is also a central tool for teaching cell biology.

===Cell culture in two dimensions===
Research in tissue engineering, stem cells and molecular biology primarily involves cultures of cells on flat plastic dishes. This technique is known as two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, and was first developed by Wilhelm Roux who, in 1885, removed a portion of the medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and maintained it in warm saline for several days on a flat glass plate. From the advance of polymer technology arose today&#x27;s standard plastic dish for 2D cell culture, commonly known as the Petri dish. Julius Richard Petri, a German bacteriologist, is generally credited with this invention while working as an assistant to Robert Koch. Various researchers today also utilize culturing laboratory flasks, conicals, and even disposable bags like those used in single-use bioreactors.

Aside from Petri dishes, scientists have long been growing cells within biologically derived matrices such as collagen or fibrin, and more recently, on synthetic hydrogels such as polyacrylamide or PEG. They do this in order to elicit phenotypes that are not expressed on conventionally rigid substrates. There is growing interest in controlling matrix stiffness, a concept that has led to discoveries in fields such as:
* Stem cell self-renewal
* Lineage specification
* Cancer cell phenotype
* Fibrosis
* Hepatocyte function
* Mechanosensing

===Cell culture in three dimensions===
Cell culture in three dimensions has been touted as &quot;Biology&#x27;s New Dimension&quot;. At present, the practice of cell culture remains based on varying combinations of single or multiple cell structures in 2D. Currently, there is an increase in use of 3D cell cultures in research areas including drug discovery, cancer biology, regenerative medicine, nanomaterials assessment and basic life science research. 3D cell cultures can be grown using a scaffold or matrix, or in a scaffold-free manner. Scaffold based cultures utilize an acellular 3D matrix or a liquid matrix. Scaffold-free methods are normally generated in suspensions. There are a variety of platforms used to facilitate the growth of three-dimensional cellular structures including scaffold systems such as hydrogel matrices and solid scaffolds, and scaffold-free systems such as low-adhesion plates, nanoparticle facilitated magnetic levitation, hanging drop plates, and rotary cell culture. Culturing cells in 3D leads to wide variation in gene expression signatures and partly mimics tissues in the physiological states. A 3D cell culture model showed cell growth similar to that of in vivo than did a monolayer culture, and all three cultures were capable of sustaining cell growth. As 3D culturing has been developed it turns out to have a great potential to design tumors models and investigate malignant transformation and metastasis, 3D cultures can provide aggerate tool for understanding changes, interactions, and cellular signaling.

==== 3D cell culture in scaffolds ====

Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that electrospinning could be used to produce nano- and submicron-scale polystyrene and polycarbonate fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for use as &quot;in vitro&quot; cell substrates. This early use of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types including Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF), transformed Human Carcinoma (HEp-2), and Mink Lung Epithelium (MLE) would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that, as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more histotypic rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed &quot;in vivo&quot;.

==== 3D cell culture in hydrogels ====
As the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) is important in the survival, proliferation, differentiation and migration of cells, different hydrogel culture matrices mimicking natural ECM structure are seen as potential approaches to in vivo–like cell culturing. Hydrogels are composed of interconnected pores with high water retention, which enables efficient transport of substances such as nutrients and gases. Several different types of hydrogels from natural and synthetic materials are available for 3D cell culture, including animal ECM extract hydrogels, protein hydrogels, peptide hydrogels, polymer hydrogels, and wood-based nanocellulose hydrogel.

==== 3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation ====
The 3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation method (MLM) is the application of growing 3D tissue by inducing cells treated with magnetic nanoparticle assemblies in spatially varying magnetic fields using neodymium magnetic drivers and promoting cell to cell interactions by levitating the cells up to the air/liquid interface of a standard petri dish. The magnetic nanoparticle assemblies consist of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and the polymer polylysine. 3D cell culturing is scalable, with the capability for culturing 500 cells to millions of cells or from single dish to high-throughput low volume systems.

===Tissue culture and engineering===
Cell culture is a fundamental component of tissue culture and tissue engineering, as it establishes the basics of growing and maintaining cells &quot;in vitro&quot;.
The major application of human cell culture is in stem cell industry, where mesenchymal stem cells can be cultured and cryopreserved for future use. Tissue engineering potentially offers dramatic improvements in low cost medical care for hundreds of thousands of patients annually.

===Vaccines===
Vaccines for polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox are currently made in cell cultures. Due to the H5N1 pandemic threat, research into using cell culture for influenza vaccines is being funded by the United States government. Novel ideas in the field include recombinant DNA-based vaccines, such as one made using human adenovirus (a common cold virus) as a vector,
and novel adjuvants.

=== Cell co-culture ===
The technique of co-culturing is used to study cell crosstalk between two or more types of cells on a plate or in a 3D matrix. The cultivation of different stem cells and the interaction of immune cells can be investigated in an in vitro model similar to biological tissue. Since most tissues contain more than one type of cell, it is important to evaluate their interaction in a 3D culture environment to gain a better understanding of their interaction and to introduce mimetic tissues. There are two types of co-culturing: direct and indirect. While direct interaction involves cells being in direct contact with each other in the same culture media or matrix, indirect interaction involves different environments, allowing signaling and soluble factors to participate.

Cell differentiation in tissue models during interaction between cells can be studied using the Co-Cultured System to simulate cancer tumors, to assess the effect of drugs on therapeutic trials, and to study the effect of drugs on therapeutic trials. The co-culture system in 3D models can predict the response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy if the microenvironment defines biological tissue for the cells.

A co-culture method is used in tissue engineering to generate tissue formation with multiple cells interacting directly.
=== Cell culture in microfluidic device ===
Microfluidics technique is developed systems that can perform a process in a flow which are usually in a scale of micron. Microfluidics chip are also known as Lab-on-a-chip and they are able to have continuous procedure and reaction steps with spare amount of reactants and space. Such systems enable the identification and isolation of individual cells and molecules when combined with appropriate biological assays and high-sensitivity detection techniques.

=== Organ-on-a-chip ===

OoC systems mimic and control the microenvironment of the cells by growing tissues in microfluidics. Combining tissue engineering, biomaterials fabrication, and cell biology, it offers the possibility of establishing a biomimetic model for studying human diseases in the laboratory. In recent years, 3D cell culture science has made significant progress, leading to the development of OoC. OoC is considered as a preclinical step that benefits pharmaceutical studies, drug development and disease modeling. OoC is an important technology that can bridge the gap between animal testing and clinical studies and also by the advances that the science has achieved could be a replace for in vivo studies for drug delivery and pathophysiological studies.

==Culture of non-mammalian cells==
Besides the culture of well-established immortalised cell lines, cells from primary explants of a plethora of organisms can be cultured for a limited period of time before senescence occurs (see Hayflick&#x27;s limit). Cultured primary cells have been extensively used in research, as is the case of fish keratocytes in cell migration studies.

===Plant cell culture methods===
Plant cell cultures are typically grown as cell suspension cultures in a liquid medium or as callus cultures on a solid medium. The culturing of undifferentiated plant cells and calli requires the proper balance of the plant growth hormones auxin and cytokinin.

===Insect cell culture===

Cells derived from &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (most prominently, Schneider 2 cells) can be used for experiments which may be hard to do on live flies or larvae, such as biochemical studies or studies using siRNA. Cell lines derived from the army worm &quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot;, including Sf9 and Sf21, and from the cabbage looper &quot;Trichoplusia ni&quot;, High Five cells, are commonly used for expression of recombinant proteins using baculovirus.

===Bacterial and yeast culture methods===

For bacteria and yeasts, small quantities of cells are usually grown on a solid support that contains nutrients embedded in it, usually a gel such as agar, while large-scale cultures are grown with the cells suspended in a nutrient broth.

===Viral culture methods===

The culture of viruses requires the culture of cells of mammalian, plant, fungal or bacterial origin as hosts for the growth and replication of the virus. Whole wild type viruses, recombinant viruses or viral products may be generated in cell types other than their natural hosts under the right conditions. Depending on the species of the virus, infection and viral replication may result in host cell lysis and formation of a viral plaque.

<text>The Buffalo News is the daily newspaper of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area, located in downtown Buffalo, New York.

It was for decades the only paper fully owned by Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway. On January 29, 2020, the paper reported that it was being sold to Lee Enterprises.

==History==

&quot;The Buffalo News&quot; was founded as a Sunday paper with the name The Buffalo Sunday Morning News in 1873 by Edward Hubert Butler, Sr.. On October 11, 1880, it began publishing daily editions as well, and in 1914, it became an inversion of its original existence by publishing Monday to Saturday, with no publication on Sunday. During most of its life, the &quot;News&quot; was known as The Buffalo Evening News. A gentleman&#x27;s agreement between the &quot;Evening News&quot; and the &quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot; meant that the &quot;Evening News&quot; would be evening-only, and the &quot;Courier-Express&quot; would be morning-only. Until 1977, the &quot;News&quot; did not publish on Sundays because of the agreement, and its weekend edition appeared on Saturday evening.

The Butler family owned the &quot;Evening News&quot; until 1974, when longtime owner and publisher Katherine Butler, granddaughter of the founder, died and left no heirs. The &quot;Evening News&quot; properties were placed in a blind trust, which sold the &quot;Evening News&quot; to Berkshire Hathaway in 1977. The new owners began publishing on Saturday and Sunday mornings. After a period of financial decline, the &quot;Courier-Express&quot; published its last issue on September 19, 1982. The &quot;Evening News&quot; then shortened its name to &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; and became an all-day newspaper, publishing two editions seven days a week.

On October 1, 2006, the &quot;News&quot; announced it would abandon its evening edition later that month.

&quot;The Buffalo News&quot; had published three morning editions (Western New York, Final and Niagara) that appeared online at BuffaloNews.com, reaching over 400,000 readers, across eight counties each day. These separate editions were eliminated in 2018 and consolidated into a single Final edition, in response to a newsprint shortage.

&quot;The News&quot;″ Designated Market Area had the largest adult population in upstate New York. Counties in total circulation area: New York - Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Steuben, Wyoming; Pennsylvania - Cameron, Erie, McKean, Potter, Warren.

The newspaper founded and owned the WBEN television and radio stations, which are now WIVB (Channel 4), WBEN (930), WYRK (106.5) and WBKV (102.5), respectively. The radio stations are now owned by other companies, but in 2014, WIVB came back under partial co-ownership with the &quot;News&quot; when Buffett&#x27;s Media General merged with the WIVB parent company, LIN Media.

The online version of &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; operates under a soft paywall allowing a limited number of page views per week. All Buffalo Bills-related content, branded as &quot;BN Blitz&quot;, is behind a hard paywall.

On January 29, 2020, the &quot;News&quot; reported it was being sold alongwith the rest of Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s newspaper portfolioto Lee Enterprises, an Iowa-based owner of 50 newspapers that has had significant ties to Berkshire Hathaway since 2012 and had operated Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s newspapers since 2018. In September 2024, ten jobs were eliminated from the newsroom which has an estimated 55 positions.

==Pulitzer Prizes==
Journalists for &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; and &quot;The Buffalo Evening News&quot; have won four Pulitzer Prizes:
* In 1958, Bruce Shanks received the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning for his August 10, 1957 piece, &quot;The Thinker&quot;, detailing union corruption. 
* In 1961, Edgar May received the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for his series, &quot;Our Costly Dilemma,&quot; concerning the need for reform of New York State&#x27;s welfare system. The series touched off debates about welfare reform nationwide. 
* In 1990, Tom Toles brought the &quot;News&quot; its second Editorial Cartooning award, for his work throughout the year (although his piece &quot;First Amendment&quot; has been cited as the work that merited the award).
* In 2015, Adam Zyglis won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning for using, in the committee&#x27;s citation, &quot;strong images to connect with readers while conveying layers of meaning in few words&quot;.

&quot;News&quot; journalists have been finalists for four other Pulitzer Prizes, but did not win: 
* Toles (1985 and 1996, for Editorial Cartooning) and, 
* James Heaney (1993, for Investigative Reporting) and,
* Staff (2015, for Breaking News Reporting).

<text>CKSO-FM was a Christian music station, which broadcast at 101.1 FM in Sudbury, Ontario in the mid-2000s.

On January 26, 2001, David Jackson (OBCI) applied to operate a new English language Christian music FM radio station in Sudbury. The new station would operate at 94.3 MHz (channel 232LP) with an effective radiated power of 50 watts. 
 The frequency was later changed to 101.1 MHz (channel 266LP)

On September 5, 2001, a group led by David Jackson was given approval to operate a new Christian music FM radio station at 101.1 FM. According to an interview with the community newspaper &quot;Northern Life&quot;, Jackson chose the CKSO call letters because of their historical significance in the Sudbury area; in addition to [[CIGM-FM]], which was known as CKSO-FM from 1965 to 1977, the call letters were also once used by an AM radio station (now CJRQ) and a television station (now CICI) in the city.

On October 8, 2002, the group asked for and was granted an extension to the deadline to commence operations. The station began airing test transmissions on December 2, 2002.

Undated, CKSO-FM was branded as &quot;101.1 The Rock&quot;.

Although the station&#x27;s website remained operational until early 2009, the Canadian Communications Foundation website reports that the station left the air in 2006. The licence, when issued, was to expire on August 31, 2008 — as of that date, however, no renewal application had been filed with the CRTC, and Jackson has not filed an application for a new license as of 2015. The radio station never relaunched.

<text>Arrow Dynamics was an American manufacturing and engineering company that specialized in designing and building amusement park rides, especially roller coasters. Based in Clearfield, Utah, the company was the successor to Arrow Development (1946–1981) and Arrow Huss (1981–1986), which were responsible for several influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries. Among the most significant was tubular steel track, which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters. The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland, built in 1959, was Arrow&#x27;s first roller coaster project.

In 1975, Arrow Development introduced the first corkscrew style track Corkscrew, at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm that sent riders through a series of corkscrews. Arrow created several other &quot;firsts&quot; over the years, introducing the first suspended roller coaster in almost a century, The Bat, in 1981, and the first &quot;hypercoaster&quot;, Magnum XL-200, which opened in 1989. They built the first 4th Dimension roller coaster, X2, which was designed by Alan Schilke in 2002.

Arrow Development&#x27;s ownership changed three times between the 1950s and 1980s. Arrow Dynamics would eventually survive two bankruptcies and spin off a sister company, Fabriweld, primarily to build track, by 1988. Arrow Dynamics eventually closed on December 3, 2001. S&amp;S Worldwide purchased part of Arrow&#x27;s remaining assets on October 28, 2002, and the remainder of the company was dissolved. In 2012, Sansei Yusoki Co. of Osaka, Japan, acquired a 77.3% interest in S&amp;S - Arrow.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
Arrow Dynamics&#x27; forerunner, Arrow Development, was founded in 1946 when Ed Morgan, Karl Bacon, Bill Hardiman, and Angus &quot;Andy&quot; Anderson, started a machine shop in Mountain View, California. They started out selling used machine tools, building truck parts, and repairing cars until about 1950 when they built their first merry-go-rounds for San Jose&#x27;s Alum Rock Park.

In 1953, they contacted Walt Disney, who was just beginning to plan a new type of amusement park in California. Disney hired the company to help design and build the vehicles for Mr. Toad&#x27;s Wild Ride. They would eventually design and build the ride systems for many of Disneyland&#x27;s original and early rides, including Mad Tea Party, King Arthur Carrousel, Casey Jr. Circus Train, and Snow White&#x27;s Scary Adventures. Disney continued to use Arrow as Disneyland expanded. Arrow designed and built Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Autopia, and Alice in Wonderland in coming years as well as upgrading and renovating the King Arthur Carrousel.

===Roller coaster manufacturing===

In 1959, Arrow Development designed what was to be their first of many roller coasters, the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Built in conjunction with WED Imagineering, the ride was the first modern tubular steel tracked roller coaster.

After construction of the Matterhorn, Disney bought a third of Arrow Development in an effort to keep them viable and at least partially in-house. Arrow had already developed rides for other customers, and had orders for more, so they moved into a larger plant in Mountain View. At the new location, Arrow developed vehicles, flumes and tracks for It&#x27;s a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean, Adventure Thru Inner Space, and the Haunted Mansion.

Arrow developed the modern log flume ride, eventually installing over 50 around the world, beginning with El Aserradero at Six Flags Over Texas in 1963. In the 1970s, the company perfected and brought back the looping roller coaster.

In 1975, Arrow installed one of the most important rides of its time, Corkscrew, which made its debut at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm as the first modern inverting coaster. Arrow made hundreds of coasters throughout the decades, including 17 Corkscrew-style coasters, 16 &quot;runaway mine train&quot; coasters like Cedar Creek Mine Ride and Adventure Express, custom-designed coasters like Loch Ness Monster, and Carolina Cyclone.

Some of Arrow Development&#x27;s later projects included what were at the time the world&#x27;s tallest roller coasters, such as Magnum XL-200 at Cedar Point in 1989, and The Big One at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in 1994.

===Reorganizations and bankruptcy===

In 1971, Karl Bacon, Ed Morgan and Walter Schulze sold Arrow Development to Rio Grande Industries. At the time, Penn Central owned Six Flags and Rio Grande had plans to build theme parks of their own, purchasing Frontier Village in 1973. In the late 1970s, Arrow began teaching Vekoma how to build tubular track in their native Holland, and in return Vekoma became Arrow&#x27;s European distributor. Rio Grande sold Arrow to the German manufacturing firm Huss Maschinenfabrik in 1981. The merger formed Arrow Huss. Dana Morgan, the son of Ed Morgan, was appointed the company&#x27;s president, and Ron Toomer was made vice president and manager of engineering. Dana would leave the company and form Morgan Manufacturing in 1983. Although Arrow&#x27;s coasters continued to sell well, Arrow Huss struggled financially, partially due to heavily investing in the Darien Lake theme park in New York, and the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans. Arrow Huss filed for bankruptcy in 1985, and 13 of the company&#x27;s American officers negotiated a buyout. In 1986, the takeover was approved by the courts and the company re-emerged as Arrow Dynamics. Toomer served as president until 1993, Chairman of the Board until 1995, and as a consulting director until his retirement in 1998.

In the late 1990s, Arrow Dynamic&#x27;s bookings steadily decreased, with few installations toward the end of the decade. Despite attempts to keep up by implementing more updated design techniques, Arrow still found itself struggling to compete. Other manufacturers such as Bolliger &amp; Mabillard and Intamin began to dominate the industry.

Design and manufacturing costs for new, larger ride systems were increasing and competition grew. Bankruptcy loomed once again just as Arrow introduced X (subsequently known as X2) at Six Flags Magic Mountain, a 4th dimension roller coaster designed by Alan Schilke. X opened to massive media attention and received an initially positive reception; however, several mechanical problems caused the ride to be closed for repairs during much of its first year of operation.

The company filed for bankruptcy again on December 3, 2001. At the end of October 2002, the remaining assets were sold to S&amp;S Worldwide, a limited liability company related to amusement ride manufacturer, forming S&amp;S Arrow. In November 2012, Sansei Yusoki Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, acquired a 77.3% interest in S&amp;S.

<text>Costa Valle Imagna (Bergamasque: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; counting c 600 inhabitants in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, northern Italy. Neighbouring communes are Bedulita, Carenno, Roncola, Sant&#x27;Omobono Terme and Torre de&#x27; Busi.

==Geography==
Costa lies on a high slope above the Valle Imagna. The village has panoramic views of the Bergamo Alps, including Monte Resegone to the north. From the former ski resort of Forcella Alta and the Pertüs pass, elevation , the whole of the Brianza range is visible. For communication reasons the town has had closer links to the San Martino valley, Almenno San Salvatore and the plain, rather than to the rest of the Valle Imagna.
==History==
Originally the area seems to have been used for summer grazing, Costa seems to have been populated year-round only since 1300. The town faces northeast and gets very cold in winter; as a result Costa was known in local slang as &quot;Valle Imagna&#x27;s warehouse of snow&quot; (&quot;la nevera della Valle imagna&quot;).

When the Republic of Venice annexed the province of Bergamo in 1428, the town found itself on the borders between Venice and the Duchy of Milan. This is reflected in the slang of the town, which refers to &quot;foreigners&quot; as &quot;bir&quot;, the equivalent of &quot;sbirri&quot;, a medieval police force. It has been suggested that this dates back to customs officials sent from Venice to patrol the borders of the republic.

In the Counter-Reformation, a bishop sent a dispatch deploring the state of the village&#x27;s church that was a result of the poverty of the area. A plague pit is evidence of the 1630 epidemic described by Alessandro Manzoni.

Since the early 20th century, Costa Valle Imagna has grown in its role of summer resort.

<doc id="1106854" wikidata="Q1754144" url="?curid=1106854" title="Walk On (Boston album)">
<text>Walk On is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Boston, released on June 7, 1994, by MCA Records. It is the band’s only album to date not to feature vocalist Brad Delp, though he did assist as a songwriter. Vocal duties were handled by Fran Cosmo, making this his first appearance on a Boston album. Delp and Cosmo shared leads during the album&#x27;s supporting tour and the album’s follow-up &quot;Corporate America&quot;. It is Boston&#x27;s final album to be released by MCA.

==History==
After the success of their 1986 album &quot;Third Stage&quot;, the band began planning a follow-up and writing for &quot;Walk On&quot;, which began in 1988. Brad Delp, having fulfilled his agreement to finish the recording and tour of &quot;Third Stage&quot; after quitting the band in 1981 after the firing of original guitarist Barry Goudreau, left the band in 1989 to join Goudreau in forming a new band (named RTZ). Soon after, Fran Cosmo was hired and introduced as the new lead singer. Cosmo had previously worked with Goudreau in the band Orion the Hunter. So, effectively, Scholz and Goudreau swapped vocalists in their musical projects.

Delp returned to Boston to assist in the songwriting, and shared lead vocals on the subsequent &quot;Walk On Tour&quot;, though he did not sing on the album. Delp and Cosmo also shared leads on Boston&#x27;s next album &quot;Corporate America&quot;.

After its release, &quot;Walk On&quot; peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and yielded the hit &quot;I Need Your Love.&quot; It was certified platinum by the RIAA on September 8, 1994.

The final eight pages of the album&#x27;s booklet were titled &quot;Walk On — Against Violence and Cruelty&quot;, and dedicated to preventing domestic abuse and animal cruelty, providing contact information of numerous organizations, including the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Humane Society. It was noted that Delp himself was a contributor to these causes.

&quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Paul Elliott rated &quot;Livin&#x27; for You&quot; as Boston&#x27;s 3rd greatest song of all time and as Boston&#x27;s greatest ballad.

==Track listing==

* Tracks 4, 5, 6 and 7 are all part of one long song (&quot;Walk On Medley&quot;), but were indexed separately on the CD.

<text>San Juan Jabloteh Football Club is a football club located in San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago that plays in the country&#x27;s TT Pro League. The team plays its home games in Hasely Crawford Stadium in Mucurapo, Trinidad.

== History ==
The club was founded in 1974, with the stated objective to &quot;uplift the socio-economic and moral condition of the young people of San Juan and its environs.&quot; Upon the creation, by the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association, of a Semi-Professional League in 1994, San Juan Jabloteh converted itself from a youth organization into a professional football club. With the backing of CL Financial in 1996, the club significantly expanded its operations. From 1997 to 1999, the team finished fourth in the Semi-Professional League in three consecutive years.

Upon the creation of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s first professional league in 1999, San Juan Jabloteh became one of the league&#x27;s founding members. Since joining, the club has been the league&#x27;s most successful club, winning the league championship in 2002, 2003–04, 2007 and 2008. San Juan Jabloteh have also represented the league in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup in 2004.

According to the team&#x27;s website, &quot;Through its name of the Club identified itself with one of the national birds of the country – the Oil or Devil Bird-which lives in the Aripo Caves. Originally, the French settlers called the Bird: Les Diables Oiseaux which were translated by the local settlers into Diablotin and finally Jabloteh.&quot;

In July 2012, the club chose to withdraw the senior team from the TT Pro League, having already ceased to work on youth football projects and chose to concentrate on their netball team.

<text>Riverside Records was an American jazz record company and label. Founded by Orrin Keepnews and Bill Grauer, Jr, under his firm Bill Grauer Productions in 1953, the label played an important role in the jazz record industry for a decade. Riverside headquarters were located in New York City, at 553 West 51st Street.

==History==
Initially the company was dedicated to reissuing early jazz material drawn from the issues of the Paramount and Gennett and Hot Record Society (H.R.S.), labels among others. Reissued artists included Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver, Ma Rainey, and James P. Johnson, but the label began issuing its own contemporary jazz recordings in April 1954, beginning with pianist Randy Weston. In 1955 the Prestige Records contract of Thelonious Monk was bought out and Monk was signed by Riverside, where he remained for the next five years. During the next few years, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Charlie Byrd, Johnny Griffin, and Wes Montgomery made substantial contributions to Riverside&#x27;s catalog. Most new records were produced by Keepnews, who served as creative head of the label and several subsidiaries, such as Jazzland Records, with Grauer directing the company&#x27;s sales and business operations. Judson was another subsidiary label which mainly concentrated on musical genres other than jazz.

Riverside offered an extensive folk catalog, including traditional performers like Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Obray Ramsey, and George Pegram and Walter Parham; and folk interpreters like Ewan MacColl, Jean Ritchie, Paul Clayton, Billy Faier, Oscar Brand, Cynthia Gooding and Bob Gibson.

In 1956, Bill Grauer recorded, produced and edited the racing sounds of the Florida International Twelve-Hour Grand Prix of Endurance, Riverside Records RLP 5001. The record also contains interviews with Stirling Moss, Juan Manuel Fangio and other racing drivers.

== Jazzland Records ==
==Living Legends==
In 1960–61 Riverside produced an acclaimed series of albums featuring jazz and blues veterans such as Jim Robinson, Sweet Emma Barrett and Alberta Hunter. The objective was to record musicians before their artistry was lost forever. Indeed, many were no longer active, and thus their union memberships had expired. Recognizing the importance of the project, the American Federation of Musicians suspended its union shop rules on their behalf. This &quot;Living Legends&quot; series was initially recorded in New Orleans. Later sessions were recorded in Chicago. The sessions took place at Societé des Jeunes Amis Hall, built in the 1800s. According to the producer, Chris Albertson, the hall was a &quot;Creole fraternal headquarters and it proved to have every advantage over a studio; apart from its live sound, it gave the performers familiar surroundings... The hall&#x27;s acoustical sound was exactly what I wanted to recapture: the same kind of ambience that lent such character to Bill Russell&#x27;s 1940s American Music recordings from San Jacinto Hall.&quot; One of the musicians invited to participate was Louis Cottrell, Jr. Cottrell organized a trio comprising McNeal Breaux, Alcide &quot;Slow Drag&quot; Pavageau with Emanuel Sayles sitting in playing guitar and banjo. The band was so well received that they continued to play together. The music on this album has been described as &quot;more polite and subtle than the city&#x27;s &#x27;downtown&#x27; music... an intimate, low-key delight.&quot; Cottrell&#x27;s playing has also been well received:

==Riverside Wonderland==
Under the subsidiary label Riverside Wonderland, the company also produced a series of children&#x27;s albums, the &quot;Grandpa Magic&quot; series of albums starring Ed Wynn, including two Alec Templeton albums, an album of Martyn Green reading from the Arabian Nights, and a six-record album set of the complete &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, narrated by Cyril Ritchard, a rarity in the LP era when books were seldom recorded complete. An album of excerpts from the book was also issued, and the six records in the complete set were also issued as separate volumes. Riverside Wonderland also acquired U.S. rights to package and distribute musical recordings produced in England by Fiona Bentley, including &quot;The First Christmas&quot; with Dame Edith Evans, &quot;Musical Zoo&quot; with The Mike Sammes Singers, and Beatrix Potter stories narrated by Vivien Leigh. The British recordings were licensed by A.A. Records in the seventies, when that company was transitioning from Golden Records to Wonderland Records (no connection to Riverside).

==End==
Grauer died of a sudden heart attack in December 1963, and the company filed for voluntary bankruptcy in July 1964. The catalogue was taken over by ABC Records, which reissued some of it, but virtually all Riverside masters were acquired by Fantasy Records in 1972. The majority of this material was subsequently reissued on LP on the Milestone label and as part of Fantasy&#x27;s Original Jazz Classics series from the 1980s on CD. The Riverside catalog is now owned by the Concord label group.
