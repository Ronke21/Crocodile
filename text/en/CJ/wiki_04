<text>The Suriname national football team (; Sranan Tongo: ) represents Suriname in international football. The team is controlled by the Surinamese Football Association, which is a member of CONCACAF.

==History==
Although the former Dutch colony is located in South America, it competes in CONCACAF, together with Guyana and French Guiana. Suriname was one of the founding members of CONCACAF in 1961. Suriname won the CFU Championship in 1978, were runners-up in 1979 and have achieved three fourth-place finishes in the CFU Championship/Caribbean Cup.
Suriname discourages dual citizenship and Surinamese-Dutch players who have picked up a Netherlands passport – which, crucially, offers legal work status in almost any European league – are barred from selection to the national team. Many Suriname-born players and Dutch-born players of Surinamese descent, like Gerald Vanenburg, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf, Patrick Kluivert, Michael Reiziger, Aron Winter, Georginio Wijnaldum, Virgil van Dijk and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink have turned out to play for the Dutch national team. In 1999, Humphrey Mijnals, who played for both Suriname and the Netherlands, was elected Surinamese footballer of the century. Another famous player is André Kamperveen, who captained Suriname in the 1940s and was the first Surinamese to play professionally in the Netherlands.

Suriname has participated in the qualifying matches for the FIFA World Cup since 1962, but has never qualified for the finals. Suriname&#x27;s strongest showing in World Cup qualification was the campaign for the 1978 finals, when the national team reached the final group stage.

Suriname also came second in CONCACAF qualifying for the 1964 Olympics, behind qualifiers Mexico and third in qualifying for the 1980 Olympics, behind qualifiers Costa Rica and United States. The US then boycotted the Moscow Olympics, and were replaced by Cuba in the football tournament, after Suriname opted to boycott the games as well.

In 2008 Suriname advanced to the group stage of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying despite using only local players. With their two-leg victory over neighbours Guyana, Suriname moved on to face Haiti, Costa Rica, and El Salvador in the third round.

Inspired by the success of teams with dual nationals, especially Algeria, SVB president John Krishnadath submitted a proposal to the national assembly to allow dual citizenship for athletes with the then-goal of reaching the 2018 FIFA World Cup finals. In order to support this project, a team with professional players of Surinamese origin was assembled and played an exhibition match on 26 December 2014 at the Andre Kamperveen Stadion. The project is managed by Nordin Wooter and David Endt, who have set up a presentation and sent invitations to 100 players of Surinamese origin, receiving 85 positive answers. Dean Gorré was named to coach this special selection. FIFA supported the project and granted insurance for the players and clubs despite the match being unofficial.

As of May 2015, Gorré was the national team coach who oversaw both the official and unofficial teams. The professional team consisted of players willing to commit to Suriname if the dual-citizenship bill was approved, and played two international matches. In 2016, Roberto Gödeken became the head coach once again. In qualification for the 2017 Caribbean Cup, Suriname secured a spot in the third round, but finished second behind Jamaica in their group. However, as one of the three best second-place finishers, Suriname advanced to face Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti in the 5th place play-off. Suriname won the match against Trinidad and Tobago, but lost against Haiti, hence once again a failed attempt to make an appearance in the Concacaf Gold Cup.

In 2018 Dean Gorré signed a new 2 year contract with the SVB to manage Natio once more. His first game ended in a draw against Dominica in Nations League qualifiers. Gorré became not only the head coach of the senior team, but also oversees the youth teams and also has a helping hand in the introduction of a professional league in the country. Gorré also managed to arrange trainingcamps for the national team in the Netherlands, where Natio have tested their strength against professional and amateur football clubs.

Suriname qualified for the CONCACAF Nations League B after wins against Saint Kitts and Nevis and British Virgin Islands, draw against Dominica and a loss against Jamaica. Suriname got to share a group with Nicaragua, SVG and Dominica. After a narrow away win against Dominica, Suriname got to bag a massive 6–0 win at home against Nicaragua.

In November 2019, it was announced that a so-called sports passport would allow Dutch professional footballers from the Surinamese diaspora to represent Suriname. On 19 November, Suriname qualified for the 2021 Gold Cup with 2–1 CONCACAF Nations League win over Nicaragua. It will be their debut in the CONCACAF Gold Cup and their first appearance in a CONCACAF tournament since 1985.

In the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup, Suriname played against Costa Rica, Jamaica and Guadeloupe in Group C. Suriname lost its first two matches against Jamaica and Costa Rica, but ended third in the group following a 2-1 win against Guadeloupe.

In late July, the Surinamese Football Association terminated the contract of Dean Gorré after failing to reach Natio&#x27;s objectives.
After the termination of Gorré, SVB announced that they have hired the services of Brian Tevreden&#x27;s Tevreden Group. The Tevreden Group are involved in the search for a new national coach and the recruitment and selection of Surinamese-Dutch professionals who want to play for Natio.

<text>Virginia is a gold mining town located in the Lejweleputswa District Municipality and on goldfields of the Free State province in South Africa about 140 km (90 mi) northeast of Bloemfontein, the provincial capital.

==History==
In 1890, two railway surveyors from the state of Virginia in the United States etched the name of their birthplace on a boulder near the farm Merriespruit. When a railway siding was eventually established at this spot, the name was adopted, and it stuck after the discovery of gold in 1949 which resulted in a mushrooming settlement on the banks of the Sand River. In 1988 the Sand River burst its banks and flooded parts of the town. In 1994 the Merriespruit tailings dam disaster occurred just outside Virginia, killing seventeen people. 

On 5 December 2000, Virginia was incorporated into the Matjhabeng Local Municipality along with the city of Welkom and the towns of Allanridge, Hennenman, Odendaalsrus and Ventersburg. During the apartheid era, black people Lived outside Virginia in the location of Meloding. The town itself boomed during the gold mining years&#x27; golden age and gold mining is still responsible for most of the town&#x27;s economy.

==Economy==
Virginia is surrounded by some of the largest gold fields in Free State, and its economy is dominated by mining, gold-extraction plants, and the manufacture of sulfuric acid from gold ore. It is also known for having the deepest pipe-mine into the earth on the planet. Commercial farms in the surrounding area primarily grow maize (corn) and raise livestock. Virginia is located on the main rail line between Bloemfontein and 
Johannesburg.

<text>Guadarrama is a town and municipality in the Cuenca del Guadarrama comarca, in the Community of Madrid, Spain.

Its population is 17,063 according to the Continuous Register of 2023; the population swells to approximately 60,000 in summer. In the 2023 Spanish general election, for the Congress of Spain the residents voted 41.29% for the People&#x27;s Party, 24.54% for the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, and 19.45% voted for Vox.

Its name comes from Arabic Wadi-l-ramla river (the sandy river).

Guadarrama achieved the status of &quot;villa&quot; under Fernando V of Castile (II of Aragon) on November 22, 1504. Fernando VI ordered the building of a road to A Coruña through the Guadarrama Pass, through which passed the with Napoleon searching for John Moore&#x27;s Army in 1808.

This town was absolutely destroyed during the Spanish Civil War, as it was for almost three years a battlefront. All one can see in this town today is new, built in the mid-20th century.

It was the location for some scenes in the 1964 film &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.

It is close to Sierra de Guadarrama, a mountain range that is visited by Madrid residents seeking cooler temperatures, especially in summer.

<text>Real-time video editing is a system of editing video where it takes no longer to render a video than the length of that video clip itself. Live video editing is where there are various cameras at various angles and position, capturing single or multiple subjects and the footage is routed through a vision mixing device and edited and transmitted in real-time.

Broadcasters traditionally used large, disparate computer systems for real-time video editing with multiple CPUs, multiple gigabytes of RAM and high-powered hard drives. Some had additional hardware components designed to enhance the performance of the specific video editing software being used. Other approaches used to ensure real-time playback included continuous background rendering, and using multiple networked computers to share the rendering load. These systems would allow broadcasters to edit and render a video clip in 30 minutes.

These systems are now outdated thanks to the instantaneous nature of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Broadcasters and content rights holders now use cloud-based video editing technology which allows them to clip, edit and share video across multiple digital platforms such as websites and social apps within seconds rather than minutes.

Blackbird is one of the earliest examples of a cloud-based video service. Invented by Stephen Streater and released in 2004, it is credited as the first cloud-based video editor. Its diverse userbase extends from global, national and regional media organisations, leading sports content distributors and post-production houses to government departments.

Grabyo is an example of a cloud-based real-time video editing platform. It was founded in 2013, has partnerships with Facebook and Twitter and is used by some of the largest media companies in Europe and North America.

<doc id="1079802" wikidata="Q156724" url="?curid=1079802" title="Kremenchuk">
<text>Kremenchuk (; , , also spelt Kremenchug) is an industrial city in central Ukraine which stands on the banks of the Dnieper River. The city serves as the administrative center of Kremenchuk Raion and Kremenchuk urban hromada within Poltava Oblast. Its population is approximately ranking 31st in Ukraine. In 2001, the Ukrainian government included the city in the list of historical settlements.

Although not as large as some oblast centers, Kremenchuk has a large industrial center in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. A KrAZ truck plant, the Kremenchuk Oil Refinery of Ukrtatnafta, the Kriukiv Railway Car Building Works, and Kremenchuk Hydroelectric Power Plant, in nearby Svitlovodsk, are located in or near Kremenchuk. Highway M22 crosses the Dnieper over the dam of the power plant.

Originally established on the left bank, Kremenchuk eventually incorporated the city of on the right bank. The Kriukiv Railway Car Building Works is one of the oldest railway-repair and rail-car-building factories in Eastern Europe, dating from 1869.

==History==
Kremenchuk was founded in 1571 as a fortress. The name Kremenchuk is explained as deriving from the word &quot;kremen&quot; - flint (a mineral) because the city is located on a giant chert plate. An alternative explanation says that &quot;Kremenchuk&quot; is the Turkish for &quot;small fortress&quot;.

In 1625, at Lake Kurukove in Kremenchuk, the Treaty of Kurukove was signed between Cossacks and the Poles. Since the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate, the city was part of the Chyhyryn Polk (regiment). Following the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667) and Treaty of Andrusovo, the city was secured by the Tsardom of Russia and became part of the Myrhorod Polk (regiment) within the left-bank of the Cossack Hetmanate. The city played a key role in the Russian colonization policy of Ukraine and their striving for the shores of Black Seas as regional administrative center of the early Novorossiya Governorate and Yekaterinoslav Vice-regency (Namestnichestvo). With the creation of Novorossiya Governorate, the Dnieper Pikemen Regiment () was created and coincidentally a few years later (1768–69) in the neighboring regions of Poland began the Koliyivshchyna. Here in 1786 the Russian general Alexander Suvorov started his military career when he was appointed a commander of the local garrison (in preparation of the 1787–1792 Russo-Turkish War).

Following defeat in the Crimean War began the installation of a network of railroads in Russia, and in 1869 in Kryukiv were built small railcar repair shops, while in 1872 the city of Kriukiv was connected with Kremenchuk by a railroad bridge over the Dnieper. In 1870 in Kremenchuk a factory was built that produced and maintained agrarian equipment and iron cast products. In 1899 a network of tramway transportation was introduced in Kremenchuk that existed until the complete establishment of Soviet regime in Ukraine in 1921.

During the Russian February Revolution of 1917, power in the city was controlled by a council (soviet) of workers&#x27; deputies which was dominated by the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and the head of the city council was the future Ukrainian Communist leader . During the Ukrainian–Soviet War, on 26 January 1918, Russian Bolshevik troops secured the city, however already in February of the same year they had to withdraw due to the treaty of Brest-Litovsk and advance of German and Ukrainian armies. Following the World War I hostilities between the Bolshevik Russia and Ukraine renewed and on 1 February 1919 the Russian Red Army once again secured the city. However, in May of the same year Kremechuk was engulfed in the insurgency of Otaman Grigoriev who earlier sided with Bolsheviks and drove the international force of Triple Entante from Odesa. From July to December 1919 the city was occupied by the Russian &quot;White Guard&quot; troops of Anton Denikin. Following their withdrawal, the Denikin&#x27;s troops blew up the railroad bridge.

In 1920–1922, the city was the administrative center of the short-lived during a peasant insurgency (Kholodnyi Yar) near Chyhyryn (just west of the city). During the 1930s, Kremenchuk&#x27;s industry was transformed, its Kriukiv railcar repair shops became a railcar manufacturing factory, while its factory in production of agrarian equipment changed to manufacturing road equipment.

During World War II (1939–1945), Kremenchuk suffered heavily under Nazi occupation. It was occupied from 15 September 1941, to 29 September 1943. More than 90% of the city&#x27;s buildings were leveled over the course of the war. 29 September, the day when the city was liberated from the Nazis in 1943, is celebrated in Kremenchuk as City Day. Despite a remarkable post-war recovery and a healthier economy, Kremenchuk lacks much of the architectural charm and distinctly Ukrainian (rather than Russian) character of its sister city, the oblast capital of Poltava.

During the Cold War, Kremenchuk became the headquarters for the 43rd Rocket Division of the 43rd Army of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces. The division was equipped with R-12 Dvina intercontinental ballistic missiles.

In 1975 the city of Kryukiv was merged with Kremenchuk, while Kremenchuk was divided in two raions in city.

In 2014 during the mass demolition of monuments to Vladimir Lenin in Ukraine, in the city were removed two monuments of the Russian Communist leader in the city center and near the Kryukiv Railcar Factory.

Oleh Babayev, the mayor of Kremenchuk was assassinated on 26 July 2014. Oleh Babayev opposed separatism and promoted national unity, prior to becoming mayor he was a member of the Batkivshchyna political party which opposed Victor Yanukovich. His political views and Kremenchuk&#x27;s large industrial base may have been the motivation for the attack.

During the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine security at the Kremenchuk Reservoir was heightened as it was seen as a possible target for saboteurs.

Until 18 July 2020, Kremenchuk was designated as a city of oblast significance and did not belong to Kremenchuk Raion even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Poltava Oblast to four, the city was merged into Kremenchuk Raion.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kremenchuk has been under attack by Russian forces. On 27 April and 12 May an oil refinery was hit by Russian missiles and will be out of operation for months. On 27 June a shopping mall was hit by Russian missiles and caught fire, 16 people died and 59 were injured. Just after the strike, a nearby factory was hit. Russian authorities claimed that the factory hosted weapons supplied by the US and European countries. In 2014, the factory was known to repair armoured personnel carriers (BTR-70s).

== Jewish community and Holocaust ==
Jews initially began to settle in the city in 1782, and by 1801, there were 454 registered taxpayers in Kremenchuk. As a result of Jewish emigration from further north in the Pale of Settlement, many Jews from northern provinces settled in the city in the mid-19th century. The community had grown sevenfold within a half decade to 3,475 by 1847. The 1897 All-Russia Census recorded the Jewish population of Kremenchuk at 29,768, or at 47% of the total population. Growth of the city&#x27;s Jewish population stagnated, still hovering at 28,969 by 1926, around 50% of the population, later heavily falling to 19,880 by 1939.

Nazi forces occupied Kremenchuk on 9 September 1941, setting restrictions on Jewish purchases and forcing them to wear the Yellow Star of Jude. On 27 September 1941, they were exiled from the city, and forced to move into the Ghetto in Novo-Ivanovka.uk] Many Jews who hid throughout the city were later caught and forced into the Ghettos as well. Between October 1941 and January 1942, a total of around 8,000 Jews were shot and killed in various instances of execution over the months, although the community was not entirely wiped out. The Ghetto and town were liberated 29 September 1943 by the Red Army. A Jewish community of over 5,000 remained in the city throughout the 1950s, although dwindled in the 1990s during migration to Israel.

There are a few Jewish cemeteries from different parts of the 20th century in the area, with the last burials having occurred in Jewish Cemetery II in the 1990s.

<text>Mumbles Lighthouse, completed in 1794, is a lighthouse located in Mumbles, near Swansea. The structure, which sits on the outer of two islands off Mumbles Head, is clearly visible from any point along the five mile sweep of Swansea Bay. Along with the nearby lifeboat station, it is the most photographed landmark in the village.
The tower has two tiers and initially two open coal fire lights were displayed. These open coal fire lights were difficult to maintain and were soon replaced by a single oil-powered light within a cast-iron lantern.

In 1860, the oil-powered light was upgraded to a dioptric light and the Mumbles Battery, a fort that surrounds the tower, was built by the War Department.

In 1905, an occulting mechanism, where the light was made to flash, was fitted. This was partially automated in 1934.

By 1977, the cast-iron lantern had deteriorated beyond repair and was removed. A different lantern was added in 1987.

In 1995, the main light was replaced and an array of solar panels and emergency monitoring equipment were added.

<doc id="1079807" wikidata="Q2493539" url="?curid=1079807" title="Norihiko Hibino">
<text>is a Japanese video game composer and saxophonist.

==Biography==
Hibino was born in Osaka. He graduated from the Osaka University School of Human Sciences in 1996. After graduating from Berklee College of Music in 1997, he moved to Kansas City to start a career as a solo jazz musician. He later relocated to Japan to work for Konami, where he became known for his work on Konami&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; video game series.

After working with Konami, Hibino started his own company, GEM Impact, which is a studio consisting of composers Takahiro Izutani, Yoshitaka Suzuki, Takahide Ayuzawa, and himself. An additional part of GEM Impact is GEM Factory, an in-house record label which has put out the debut album of &quot;The Outer Rim&quot; and the &quot;Ninja Blade&quot; soundtrack. Through GEM Impact, Hibino and his team have been able to work on games, anime, websites, and other projects that require music. While their involvement with &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; was not publicized by Konami, Hibino divulged in an interview with Original Sound Version that GEM Impact in fact provided approximately 90 minutes of music for the game&#x27;s cinematic sequences. On September 2, 2008, Hibino and GEM Impact were announced to be the composers for the action title &quot;Ninja Blade&quot;.

In 2009, GEM Impact&#x27;s in-house label, GEM Factory released the two-disc Ninja Blade soundtrack, and Hibino went on to found Hibino Sound Therapy Lab, a venture that explores the therapeutic applications of music. His first project under this company was Prescription for Sleep, an iPhone and iPod touch application that attempts to lure users to sleep with 20 minutes of soothing, live-recorded music. Hibino also teamed up with a Chinese producer to create &quot;Gentle Love,&quot; a light smooth jazz arrangement album of pop hits from China, Japan, and the US. Other activities included a panel at GDC 2009 about the game music business in Japan, two performance at the 2009 GANG Awards, performances of &quot;Snake Eater&quot; at Video Games Live in Singapore and Brazil, and a live performance of Gentle Love. GEM Impact also contributed to the score for &quot;Bayonetta&quot;. He was also awarded the Berklee &quot;Distinguished Alumni&quot; award for his entrepreneurial spirit and use of music in unconventional ways to reach a new audience.

After 2009, Hibino worked on fewer game projects and focused his energies on the therapeutic applications of music being explored through Hibino Sound Therapy Lab. He began recording material under the GENTLE LOVE moniker, featuring himself on saxophone and pianist Ayaki Sato (AYAKI) on piano. Several albums were recorded, including the &quot;Hibino Sound Therapy Lab Sound Library&quot; and &quot;Prescription for Sleep Volume 2&quot;. Over the next several years, Hibino would record solo harp, chamber groups, and more GENTLE LOVE to amass a library for his new therapeutic sound system called the RINSHU, which is a hand-carved sound system crafted by woodworkers in Japan in the likeness of a yacht. The system was released in Japan in 2014 and was patented and released in the United States in 2015.

After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan, Hibino and AYAKI toured the affected areas, performing free concerts to promote healing for those in need. This resulted in the creation of the Music in Heaven spiritual care events which have taken place all throughout Japan, combining musical performances, conceptual footage displayed on a large screen above the stage, and a wellness event. Music in Heaven, which began in 2013, celebrated 50 performances in 2015, and is still being regularly scheduled throughout Japan.

Hibino continued to maintain his ties with the game industry starting in 2014 with the launch of Prescription for Sleep: Game Music Lullabies, produced and published by Scarlet Moon Records. The series features Hibino and AYAKI teaming up as GENTLE LOVE to perform popular video game music to sleep and relax to. The series expanded to include Prescription for Sleep: Game Music Lullabies Volume II in 2015, a tribute to former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata and Hibino&#x27;s mentor Eiki Oshiimi titled Prescription for Peace: A Tribute to the Departed, and a third full-length album titled Prescription for Sleep: Lullabies of Mana, dedicated to &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;. A fourth Prescription for Sleep album, announced on November 2, 2016 and released on December 1, 2016, featured arrangements from &quot;Undertale&quot;. In 2016, Hibino co-wrote the score for the animated short, &quot;Sinmara Saga&quot;, with composer Dale North.

<text>Grigory Naumovich Chukhray (23 May 192128 October 2001) was a Soviet film director and screenwriter of Ukrainian origin. People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR (1981). He&#x27;s the father of the Russian film director Pavel Chukhray.

==Early life==
Grigory Chukhray was born in Melitopol (modern-day Zaporizhzhia Oblast of Ukraine) to Red Army soldiers Naum Zinovievich Rubanov and Claudia Petrovna Chukhray. He was of Ukrainian origin. His parents divorced when he was three years old. He was raised by a stepfather, Pavel Antonovich Litvinenko, the head of kolkhoz. His mother Claudia Chukhray took an active part in the collectivization and dekulakization of the Ukrainian SSR, then worked as an investigation officer at militsiya.

In 1939, he was drafted to the army. A decorated veteran of World War II, Chukhray&#x27;s wartime experiences profoundly affected him and the majority of his films. He served in the 229th separate communications battalion of the 134th Infantry Division (later part of the 19th Army). He fought at the Southern, Stalingrad and Don Fronts. From 1943 on, he served in airborne troops at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts and took part in operation &quot;Dnipro Troopers&quot;. He was wounded three times. In 1944, he joined the Communist Party.

==Career==
At war&#x27;s end, he studied filmmaking at VGIK, the course led by Sergei Yutkevich and Mikhail Romm, and then developed his skills as a director&#x27;s assistant at the Kiev Film Studio. By the mid-1950s, he began writing and directing his own films at the Mosfilm studio, gaining cinematic recognition outside the Soviet Union at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival with his film &quot;The Forty-First&quot; (1956).

Chukhray directed and co-wrote &quot;Ballad of a Soldier&quot; (1959). Around the themes of love and the tragedy of war, the film received acclaim at home, earning the Lenin Prize. It was heralded internationally for both its story and cinematic technique. At the 1960 Cannes Film Festival it was awarded a special jury prize for &quot;high humanism and outstanding quality.&quot; &quot;Ballad of a Soldier&quot; premiered in the United States in 1960 at the San Francisco International Film Festival. The film won the Festival&#x27;s Golden Gate Award, for Best Picture and for Best Director for Grigory Chukhray. Playing worldwide, the following year, it earned the BAFTA Award for Best Film. Grigory Chukhray and script co-writer Valentin Yezhov were also nominated for the 1961 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

Chukhray&#x27;s next film was &quot;Clear Skies&quot; (1961). It told the story of a Soviet pilot who had survived Nazi imprisonment during the war, but was accused of spying. It was one of the first Soviet films to deal with some of the repressive practices under the Soviet leadership of Joseph Stalin. It won the Grand Prix (in a tie with Kaneto Shindo&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Island&quot;) at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. Two years later Chukhray served as the president of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival.

Between 1966 and 1971, Chukhray headed the director&#x27;s courses at VGIK. In 1965, he founded and headed the Experimental Studio at Mosfilm that produced such films as &quot;White Sun of the Desert&quot; (1970), &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1971), &quot;Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future&quot; (1973), &quot;A Slave of Love&quot; (1976), and other popular movies. He also served as a member of the State Committee for Cinematography between 1964 and 1991.
In 1984, Chukhray directed his final Soviet film, together with Yuri Shvyryov: &quot;I&#x27;ll Teach You to Dream&quot;. In 1992–1993, he and Rolf Schübel co-directed &quot;Todfeinde. Vom Sterben und Überleben in Stalingrad&quot;, a joined Russian-Germany documentary in two parts about the Battle of Stalingrad. In this film Chukhray as well as other Russian and German survivors told about their experiences during the battle.

In 1994, Chukhray was awarded a Nika Award for his lifetime contribution to cinema. In 2001, he published two volumes of memoirs entitled &quot;My War&quot; and &quot;My Cinema&quot;, dedicated to his war experience and his work in cinema, respectively.

He was married to Iraida Chukhray (née Penkova), a teacher of Russian language and literature. They had two children: Pavel Chukhray (born 1946), a Russian director, and Elena Chukhray (born 1961), an expert in film studies.

Grigory Chukhray died of heart failure in Moscow in 2001 at the age of eighty. He was buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery.

<doc id="1079812" wikidata="Q622755" url="?curid=1079812" title="Wintersun">
<text>Wintersun is a Finnish heavy metal band from Helsinki originally formed as the side project of Jari Mäenpää, then-vocalist and guitarist of folk metal band Ensiferum.

In 2003, Mäenpää began pulling together songs that he had been working on since 1995. These songs followed specific themes described by Mäenpää as majestic, &quot;spacy&quot;, and melodic. While Mäenpää planned to perform and record each instrument for the first album himself, he still required a drummer. He sent demos to Kai Hahto, former member of Rotten Sound, who agreed to perform the drums.

After obtaining a record deal, Mäenpää scheduled studio time to record the first album. Ensiferum&#x27;s tour to support their 2004 release was scheduled at the same time, which forced Mäenpää to request time off from the band. The band instead fired him, and Mäenpää was free to go ahead with the production of his self-titled album, &quot;Wintersun&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Wintersun&quot;, the band found permanent members to perform shows and promote the album, although a keyboardist would never be found due to the increasingly-complex and expansive nature of the orchestrations and synth parts on the new music that Mäenpää was writing at the time. In 2006, Wintersun began work on their second and third albums, &quot;Time I&quot; and &quot;Time II&quot;, which were initially intended to be released as a single album. Recording began in May of that year, but the albums would be the recipient of years-long delays for a multitude of reasons, not the least of which was the complexity of each song&#x27;s mix.

Two of the band&#x27;s members, drummer Kai Hahto and bassist Jukka Koskinen, are also members of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. In November 2023, Teemu Mäntysaari became a full member of American thrash metal band Megadeth, having filled-in on their most recent tour after Kiko Loureiro&#x27;s departure.

==History==

===2003–2004: Creation and &quot;Wintersun&quot;===

Jari Mäenpää began Wintersun in 2003 &quot;to make songs that make you feel like you are floating in space.&quot; Mäenpää chose the name &quot;Wintersun&quot; from a list a friend had produced, later explaining, &quot;&quot;Winter&quot; reflects the cold and stormy side of the album and also the Finnish melancholy and magic. &quot;Sun&quot; is related to the &#x27;universe, space and stars&#x27;-feel of the album, which is also strongly connected to the lyrics.&quot; Although the songs that would appear on &quot;Wintersun&quot; had collectively been written between 1995 and 2004 (see each track&#x27;s respective composition dates here), Mäenpää kept his songwriting efforts primarily focused on folk metal band Ensiferum, with whom he had been playing since 1996.

Mäenpää contacted Rotten Sound drummer Kai Hahto, who, upon hearing demos, agreed to work as the session drummer for &quot;Wintersun&quot;. Mäenpää and Hahto recorded demo versions of &quot;Winter Madness&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Dark Sun&quot;, and &quot;Death and the Healing&quot;, which were sent directly to Nuclear Blast. The label offered a contract for several albums stipulating that a three-song demo must be approved before each new album is recorded.

Even after obtaining a record deal, Mäenpää intended on keeping Wintersun as a side project during his tenure as lead singer and guitarist for Ensiferum. Unfortunately, to support the 2004 release of Ensiferum&#x27;s &quot;Iron&quot;, Spinefarm Records scheduled a European tour with dates that conflicted with studio time Mäenpää had booked to record &quot;Wintersun&quot;. After requesting a break from the band, Mäenpää was fired from Ensiferum.

Mäenpää focused his energies on recording &quot;Wintersun&quot; despite the lack of formal band members. The vocals, guitars, bass, and keyboards on &quot;Wintersun&quot; were performed solely by Mäenpää, who was already adept at recording multi-instrumental songs, having grown up with 8- and 16-track equipment. Three studios were used in the making of &quot;Wintersun&quot;: drums were recorded at Tico-Tico Studios, Mäenpää&#x27;s vocals, synth, and guitarwork were recorded at Sundi Coop Studios, and Nino Laurenne mixed the album at Sonic Pump Studios. Mäenpää recorded additional synth and guitar solos on his 16-track recorder. &quot;Wintersun&quot; was released on 13 September 2004.

===2004–2006: Band formation and &quot;Wintersun&quot; promotion===
Inspired by Wintersun&#x27;s musical direction, Kai Hahto left Rotten Sound and joined Wintersun as permanent drummer, and Jukka Koskinen, of Norther, joined Wintersun as bassist. Oliver Fokin, former drummer for Ensiferum and whom Mäenpää credits as inspiring him to start playing guitar, was hired as guitarist. The search for a keyboardist proved to be ineffectual.

The music video for &quot;Beyond the Dark Sun&quot; was shot over a period of two days: 3 and 4 July 2004. It was produced and directed by Maurice Swinkels.

On 4 October 2004, Wintersun announced the departure of Oliver Fokin as guitarist, and a suitable replacement would not be found until 27 December when Teemu Mäntysaari joined. The search for a keyboardist continued, and Wintersun was forced to use backup tapes for their future performances.

===2006–2017: &quot;Time I&quot;===
Recording for the second album, tentatively titled &quot;Time&quot;, began on 2 May 2006. Wintersun entered Sonic Pump Studios with Thunderstone&#x27;s Nino Laurenne as sound engineer. Recording of Hahto&#x27;s drum tracks began on 3 May. Rhythm guitars and bass were also recorded during the session. Mäenpää would record synthesizers and sampling, guitar solos, acoustic guitars, vocals, and Mäntysaari&#x27;s guitarwork at his apartment studio. The album was planned to have seven songs and an intro and outro. The songs&#x27; compositions are complex, being composed of 200 to 300 tracks each.

&quot;Time&quot; would face multiple setbacks, delaying the album&#x27;s release for years. On 23 October 2006, Wintersun released a statement that, because recording was continually delayed, the dates for the album&#x27;s mix would be pushed back to May 2007, causing Wintersun&#x27;s appearance at Ragnarök Festival that same month to be cancelled. A tentative release date for August 2007 was given.

On 17 April 2007, Mäenpää released a statement updating the status on the album, detailing that difficulties with hardware failures caused further delays in the recording process. The mix dates were cancelled, and because Laurenne&#x27;s schedule at Sonic Pump Studios was full for the remainder of the year, the album&#x27;s release was pushed back further. By this time, all guitars, including solos and acoustic, were recorded, and the intro was completed. Mäenpää had begun composing and arranging the synth layers, but stress and frustration had been hindering his creativity.

Hahto issued an update on 5 June 2008, explaining that the album&#x27;s delay would be indefinite. Difficulties with computer hardware due to limited amount of RAM affected Mäenpää&#x27;s ability to compose orchestrations in real time. However, the band appeared in Metalcamp in July 2008.

While technical difficulties pursued Wintersun into 2009, problems impeding the album&#x27;s progress would eventually include Mäenpää&#x27;s actual apartment. The increase in stress caused Mäenpää to have writer&#x27;s block. Wintersun cancelled all 2009 promotional tours to focus solely on the album&#x27;s completion.

On 17 November 2010, the Wintersun official homepage was updated stating that they would again be playing live shows. Three events, Metalfest, Bloodstock, and Metalcamp were announced. The reason stated for these shows was that a deal with their label provided money for new computer hardware in return for playing the shows.

On 16 March 2012, Wintersun announced via their official homepage that they would headline the Heidenfest Tour in October 2012. The band also stated that the mixing of their new album, &quot;Time&quot;, was going well and that a release was planned for late summer of the same year. They also stated that &quot;Time&quot; would be split in two albums. On 18 July 2012, Wintersun announced on their official homepage that part I of &quot;Time&quot; would be released on 12 October 2012. &quot;Time I&quot; was released a week later than anticipated on 19 October 2012. In support of the new album, Wintersun embarked on their first tour of North America, supporting Eluveitie along with Varg, starting in late November.

Mixing for &quot;Time II&quot; began in early 2013. The band stated the album &quot;will continue where &#x27;Time I&#x27; left [off]&quot; and include seven guitar solos. The album was expected to be released in early 2014. In August 2013, Wintersun embarked on a second North American tour. Support was provided by fellow Nuclear Blast artists Fleshgod Apocalypse, Arsis, and Starkill, with Wintersun headlining.

On 29 January 2015, Wintersun announced via their official Facebook page that Kai Hahto would be unable to perform in upcoming live shows, due to his obligations to Nightwish. Timo Häkkinen was named as his temporary replacement for live performances. In November 2016, Wintersun announced that they were looking for a second guitarist for the band so Mäenpää could focus solely on vocals during live performances.

===2017–2023: &quot;The Forest Seasons&quot; and lineup changes===
On 4 January 2017, the band announced on their Facebook page that the recording for their third studio album was completed and that it would be released later that same year. The album is not going to be &quot;Time II&quot;, but rather a new project.
On 11 January 2017 the band announced the name of their third studio album, &quot;The Forest Seasons&quot;. On 1 March the band started a crowdfunding campaign on the Indiegogo platform, the first of three projected campaigns, aiming to raise funds for their own studio. The first campaign was successful, surpassing the minimum objective of 150,000 euro in a single day, and raising 464,330 euro in total.

On 17 August 2017, the band posted their future tour dates and notified fans that drummer, Kai Hahto, is still recovering from hand injuries and cannot tour. Hahto will be continuing his tour with Nightwish. Wintersun announced its new session drummer will be Rolf Pilve of Stratovarius.

On 15 July 2019, Hahto was announced as Nightwish&#x27;s permanent drummer following Jukka Nevalainen&#x27;s decision not to return to the band.

On 28 May 2021, Jukka Koskinen was revealed as Nightwish&#x27;s session bass player for their world tour in 2021 and 2022. Koskinen was announced to have joined Nightwish as a full-time member on 21 August 2022.

On 4 May 2022, it was announced that session guitarist Asim Searah had departed the band.

On 28 November 2023, Teemu Mäntysaari was announced as a full member of Megadeth following the departure of Kiko Loureiro.

On 12 January 2024, Wintersun announced on its social media that &quot;Time II&quot; is &quot;100%&quot; complete. Three days later, on 15 January 2024, the band announced that &quot;the album release will happen in the late summer of 2024, the latest early fall&quot; and a second crowdfunding campaign was also announced. On 9 February, the band revealed the track list and cover art for &quot;Time II&quot;. The band released &quot;Time II&quot; on 30 August. The band also released a 12-disc boxset entitled the &quot;Time Package&quot;, containing alternate versions of tracks from &quot;Time II&quot; and &quot;The Forest Seasons&quot;, as well as five albums of early demo tracks for a planned four-album series.

==Musical style==
Wintersun is known for creative harmonies, fast tempos and both harsh and clean vocals. Although Mäenpää enjoys writing his music without limiting it to any genre, the band&#x27;s myriad styles have been broadly described as power metal, folk metal, melodic death metal, neo-classical metal, and black metal. Mäenpää has spoken about the genre of Wintersun&#x27;s music, and says &quot;Well it´s difficult to put into a certain genre, cause there’s lots of variation. But to describe it, I would say something like: Extreme Majestic Technical Epic Melodic Metal.&quot; He has also stated &quot;But it&#x27;s really not death metal. It&#x27;s very difficult even for me to label it, but if somebody would put a gun on my forehead, I would probably say something like Extreme Melodic Majestic Metal.&quot;

<text>Ballad of a Soldier (, &quot;Ballada o soldate&quot;), is a 1959 Soviet war romance film directed by Grigory Chukhray and starring Vladimir Ivashov and Zhanna Prokhorenko. While set during World War II, &quot;Ballad of a Soldier&quot; is not primarily a war film. It recounts, within the context of the turmoil of war, various kinds of love: the romantic love of a young couple, the committed love of a married couple, and a mother&#x27;s love of her child, as a Red Army soldier tries to make it home during a leave, meeting several civilians on his way and falling in love. The film was produced at Mosfilm and won several awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film From Any Source and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

==Plot==
A middle-aged farm woman walks through her village and gazes down a country road. A voiceover reveals that her son was killed in the war and buried in a foreign land.

On the Eastern Front, nineteen-year-old Private Alyosha Skvortsov (Vladimir Ivashov) single-handedly destroys two attacking German tanks, more out of self-preservation than bravery. His commanding general wants to give him a decoration, but Alyosha asks instead for a leave to see his mother and to repair the leaking roof of their home. He is given six days.

During his journey, he sees the devastation the war has wrought on the country and meets various people. When the jeep Alyosha is riding gets stuck in the mud, Private Pavlov helps push it out. As Alyosha will be passing through his home city, Pavlov persuades him to take a present to Pavlov&#x27;s wife. Pavlov&#x27;s sergeant reluctantly parts with two bars of soap, the entire supply for their platoon.

At the train station, Alyosha helpfully carries the suitcase of Vasya, a soldier discharged because he has lost a leg. Vasya does not want to go home, as he would be a burden to his wife, and their relationship had already been troubled. However, he changes his mind and is welcomed with open arms by the loving woman.

When he attempts to board a freight car of an army supply train, Alyosha is stopped by Gavrilkin, a sentry. However, a bribe of a can of beef eases Gavrilkin&#x27;s fear of his lieutenant, a &quot;beast&quot;. Shura (Zhanna Prokhorenko) later sneaks aboard as well, but when she sees him, she becomes frightened and tries to jump off the speeding train. Alyosha stops her from risking her life. She tells him she is going to see her fiancé, a pilot who is recuperating in a hospital. As the hours pass, she loses her fear and mistrust of him. Gavrilkin spots the civilian stowaway, forcing Alyosha to bribe him anew. When the lieutenant discovers the unauthorized passengers, he lets them remain aboard and even makes Gavrilkin return the bribe.

At one stop, Alyosha gets out to fetch some water, but the train leaves without him. Frantic, he gets a lift to the next station from an old woman truck driver. He is too late; the train has already departed. However, Shura got off and is waiting for him. The couple then go to see Pavlov&#x27;s wife. They discover that she is living with another man and leave. Alyosha returns, takes back the soap he had given her, and gives it instead to Pavlov&#x27;s invalid father.

When they finally part, Shura confesses she lied; there was no fiancé, only an aunt. Alyosha realizes too late, after his train departs, that when Shura said she had no one, she was telling him that she loves him. His train is stopped by a blown-up bridge and set on fire by German bombers. With time running out, Alyosha rafts across the river and persuades another truck driver to give him a ride to his rural village, Sosnovka. He gets to see his mother only for a few minutes before having to make his way back to his unit. His mother vows to wait for him. The voiceover tells us that while he could have gone far in life if he had lived, he will always be remembered simply as a Russian soldier.

The two lead actors, Ivashov and Prokhorenko, were both only nineteen years old and did not have much acting experience. Grigory Chukhray commented on his casting choice:

We took a big risk. It was risky to give the main roles to quite inexperienced actors. Not many would have done so in those times, but we ventured and did not regret afterwards. Volodya and Zhanna gave the most precious colouring to the film, that is, the spontaneity and charm of youth.

Both would go on to long careers in cinema.

==Production==
According to Robert Osborne, the primary host of Turner Classic Movies, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was a fan of the director, so Chukray was given more leeway than normal.

==Reception==
&quot;Ballad of a Soldier&quot; was released on December 1, 1959, in the Soviet Union and sold 30.1 million tickets at screenings.

The film was released in the United States in 1960 as part of a Soviet-American film exchange during a thaw in the Cold War. Other films shown in the US as part of this cultural exchange included &quot;The Cranes Are Flying&quot; (1957) and &quot;Fate of a Man&quot; (1959).
The film received considerable praise for both its technical craft and its strong, yet subtle story. Viewed from the earnestness and unabashed youthfulness of the protagonist, the film was hailed as an instant classic by Soviet and American critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Bosley Crowther applauded Chukray&#x27;s ability to make the film &quot;flow in such a swift, poetic way that the tragedy of it is concealed by a gentle lyric quality.&quot; He also noted the &quot;two splendid performances&quot; by Ivashov and Prokhorenko.

The film received the Lenin Prize in 1961, as did its director and producer.

==Awards==
* 1960 Cannes Film Festival - Special jury prize
* 5th San Francisco International Film Festival, 1960 - &quot;Golden Gate Award for Best Film&quot; and &quot;Golden Gate Award for Best Director&quot;
* BAFTA Award for Best Film From Any Source, 1961
* Bodil Awards for Best European Film, 1961
* Nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (1961) – Grigory Chukhray and Valentin Yezhov

<doc id="1079825" wikidata="Q721128" url="?curid=1079825" title="C. H. Waddington">
<text>Conrad Hal Waddington (8 November 1905 – 26 September 1975) was a British developmental biologist, paleontologist, geneticist, embryologist and philosopher who laid the foundations for systems biology, epigenetics, and evolutionary developmental biology.

His theory of genetic assimilation probably has a Darwinian explanation, which contrast with the fact that Waddington himself was very critic about the notion of natural selection and Neo-Darwinism. Leading evolutionary biologists including Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr considered that Waddington was using genetic assimilation to support so-called Lamarckian inheritance, the acquisition of inherited characteristics through the effects of the environment during an organism&#x27;s lifetime. 

Waddington had wide interests that included poetry and painting, as well as left-wing political leanings. In his book &quot;The Scientific Attitude&quot; (1941), he touched on political topics such as central planning, and praised Marxism as a &quot;profound scientific philosophy&quot;.

==Life==
Conrad Waddington, known as &quot;Wad&quot; to his friends and &quot;Con&quot; to family, was born in Evesham to Hal and Mary Ellen (Warner) Waddington, on 8 November 1905.

His family moved to India and until nearly three years of age, Waddington lived in India, where his father worked on a tea estate in the Wayanad district of Kerala. In 1910, at the age of four, he was sent to live with family in England including his aunt, uncle, and Quaker grandmother. His parents remained in India until 1928. During his childhood, he was particularly attached to a local druggist and distant relation, Dr. Doeg. Doeg, whom Waddington called &quot;Grandpa&quot;, introduced Waddington to a wide range of sciences from chemistry to geology. During the year following the completion of his entrance exams to university, Waddington received an intense course in chemistry from E. J. Holmyard. Aside from being &quot;something of a genius of a [chemistry] teacher,&quot; Holmyard introduced Waddington to the &quot;Alexandrian Gnostics&quot; and the &quot;Arabic Alchemists.&quot; From these lessons in metaphysics, Waddington first gained an appreciation for interconnected holistic systems. Waddington reflected that this early education prepared him for Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s philosophy in the 1920s and 30s and the cybernetics of Norbert Wiener and others in the 1940s.

He attended Clifton College and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He took the Natural Sciences Tripos, earning a First in Part II in geology in 1926. In 1928, he was awarded an Arnold Gerstenberg Studentship in the University of Cambridge, whose purpose was to promote &quot;the study of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics among students of Natural Science, both men and women.&quot; He took up a Lecturership in Zoology and was a Fellow of Christ&#x27;s College until 1942. His friends included Gregory Bateson, Walter Gropius, C. P. Snow, Solly Zuckerman, Joseph Needham, and John Desmond Bernal. His interests began with palaeontology but moved on to the heredity and development of living things. He also studied philosophy.

During World War II he was involved in operational research with the Royal Air Force and became scientific advisor to the Commander in Chief of Coastal Command from 1944 to 1945.

After the war, in 1947, he replaced Francis Albert Eley Crew as Professor of Animal Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. He would stay at Edinburgh for the rest of life with the exception of one year (1960–1961) when he was a Fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. His personal papers are largely kept at the University of Edinburgh library.

He died in Edinburgh on 26 September 1975.

==Family==
Waddington was married twice. His first marriage produced a son, C. Jake Waddington, professor of physics at the University of Minnesota, but ended in 1936. He then married architect Margaret Justin Blanco White, daughter of the writer Amber Reeves, with whom he had two daughters, the anthropologist Caroline Humphrey (1943–) and mathematician Dusa McDuff (1945–).

==Evolution==
In the early 1930s, Waddington and many other embryologists looked for the molecules that would induce the amphibian neural tube. The search was beyond the technology of that time, and most embryologists moved away from such deep problems. Waddington, however, came to the view that the answers to embryology lay in genetics, and in 1935 went to Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Drosophila&quot; laboratory in California, even though this was a time when most embryologists felt that genes were unimportant and just played a role in minor phenomena such as eye colour.

In the late 1930s, Waddington produced formal models about how gene regulatory products could generate developmental phenomena, showed how the mechanisms underpinning &quot;Drosophila&quot; development could be studied through a systematic analysis of mutations that affected the development of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; wing. In a period of great creativity at the end of the 1930s, he also discovered mutations that affected cell phenotypes and wrote his first textbook of &quot;developmental epigenetics&quot;, a term that then meant the external manifestation of genetic activity.

Waddington introduced the concept of canalisation, the ability of an organism to produce the same phenotype despite variation in genotype or environment. He also identified a mechanism called genetic assimilation which would allow an animal&#x27;s response to an environmental stress to become a fixed part of its developmental repertoire, and then went on to show that the mechanism would work.

In 1972, Waddington founded the Centre for Human Ecology in the University of Edinburgh.

===Epigenetic landscape===
Waddington&#x27;s epigenetic landscape is a metaphor for how gene regulation modulates development. Among other metaphors, Waddington asks us to imagine a number of marbles rolling down a hill. The marbles will sample the grooves on the slope, and come to rest at the lowest points. These points represent the eventual cell fates, that is, tissue types. Waddington coined the term chreode to represent this cellular developmental process. The idea was based on experiment: Waddington found that one effect of mutation (which could modulate the epigenetic landscape) was to affect how cells differentiated. He also showed how mutation could affect the landscape, and used this metaphor in his discussions on evolution—he emphasised (like Ernst Haeckel before him) that evolution mainly occurred through mutations that affected developmental anatomy.

===Genetic assimilation===

Waddington proposed an evolutionary process, &quot;genetic assimilation&quot;, as a Darwinian mechanism that allows certain acquired characteristic to become heritable. According to Navis, (2007) &quot;Waddington focused his genetic assimilation work on the crossveinless trait of &quot;Drosophila&quot;. This trait occurs with high frequency in heat-treated flies. After a few generations, the trait can be found in the population, without the application of heat, based on hidden genetic variation that Waddington asserted had been &quot;assimilated&quot;.

===Neo-Darwinism versus Lamarckism===
Waddington&#x27;s theory of genetic assimilation was controversial. The evolutionary biologists Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr both thought that Waddington was using genetic assimilation to support Lamarckian inheritance. They denied that genetic assimilation had taken place, and asserted that Waddington had simply observed the natural selection of genetic variants that already existed in the study population. Other biologists such as Wallace Arthur disagree, writing that &quot;genetic assimilation, looks, but is not Lamarckian. It is a special case of the evolution of phenotypic plasticity&quot;. Adam S. Wilkins wrote that &quot;[Waddington] in his lifetime... was widely perceived primarily as a critic of Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory. His criticisms ... were focused on what he saw as unrealistic, &#x27;atomistic&#x27; models of both gene selection and trait evolution.&quot; In particular, according to Wilkins, Waddington felt that the Neo-Darwinians badly neglected the phenomenon of extensive gene interactions and that the &quot;randomness&quot; of mutational effects, posited in the theory, was false. Even though Waddington became critical of the neo-darwinian synthetic theory of evolution, he still described himself as a Darwinian, and called for an extended evolutionary synthesis based on his research. Reviewing the debate in 2015, the systems biologist Denis Noble writes however that

==As an organiser==
Waddington was very active in advancing biology as a discipline. He contributed to a book on the role of the sciences in times of war, and helped set up several professional bodies representing biology as a discipline.

A remarkable number of his contemporary colleagues in Edinburgh became Fellows of the Royal Society during his time there, or shortly thereafter. Waddington was an old-fashioned intellectual who lived in both the arts and science milieus of the 1950s and wrote widely. His 1969 book &quot;Behind Appearance; a Study of the Relations Between Painting and the Natural Sciences in This Century&quot; (MIT press) not only has wonderful pictures but is still worth reading. Waddington was, without doubt, the most original and important thinker about developmental biology of the pre-molecular age and the medal of the British Society for Developmental Biology is named after him.

Waddington co-founded The Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the University of Edinburgh in 1969 with Professor John MacQueen, Professor of Scottish Literature and Oral Tradition.

<doc id="1079847" wikidata="Q751194" url="?curid=1079847" title="Dusack">
<text>A dusack or dussack (also &quot;dusägge&quot; and variants, from Czech &quot;tesák&quot; &quot;cleaver; hunting sword&quot;, lit. &quot;fang&quot;) is a single-edged sword of the cutlass or sabre type, in use as a side arm in Germany and the Habsburg monarchy during the 16th to 17th centuries, as well as a practice weapon based on this weapon used in early modern German fencing.

==Military sidearm==

The Czech term entered German usage in the Hussite Wars, after the sidearm used by the Hussites. In the late 16th century, &quot;Dusägge&quot; could refer to a type of weapon combining a sabre blade with the hilt of a sidesword (the German &quot;Degen&quot;), also known as &quot;Säbel auf Teutsch gefasst&quot; (&quot;sabre fitted in the German manner&quot;). The &quot;Dusägge&quot; in this sense was used as a military sidearm; e.g. in 1579, Styria records delivery of some 700 &quot;Dusäggen&quot; by local bladesmiths, besides payment of 40 &quot;Dusäggen&quot; delivered from Passau, as part of the preparation for the war against the Turks under Archduke Charles II.

The German sabre together with the name &quot;tessak&quot; was adopted in Norway. A closely related weapon is the &quot;schnepf&quot; or Swiss sabre used in Early Modern Switzerland.

==Practice weapon==

Joachim Meyer in 1570 depicts the &quot;Dusäck&quot; as the practice weapon with broad, curving blade and a simple oval grip. 
The dussack represented a short, single-edged weapon in a training environment. As usage of the dussack became more widespread, various schools turned use of the dussack into a sport as opposed to training for a real weapon.

Practice dussacks had a short, thick, single-edged blade measuring between long. A dussack was usually made of wood. Additionally there is a single reference to dussacks also being made from leather, and there are a small number of simple metal known to survive. The dussack was gently curved and brought to a point at the tip. The dussack often lacked a hilt. Instead, the handgrip was merely a hole cut inside of the blade; without a pommel or upper guard, it looked something like a large hole for gripping scissors.

Egerton Castle claimed that dussacks were used by the French Navy up through the 19th century.

No wooden (or leather) practice dussacks are known to have survived; unsurprising given the perishable nature of these dussacks, and only woodcuts and training manuals from the period document their existence.

<doc id="1079852" wikidata="Q3050403" url="?curid=1079852" title="Elaine Sturtevant">
<text>Elaine Frances Sturtevant (née Horan; August 23, 1924 – May 7, 2014), also known professionally as Sturtevant, was an American artist. She achieved recognition for her carefully inexact repetitions of other artists&#x27; works.

==Early life and education==

Elaine Frances Horan was born on August 23, 1924, in Lakewood, Ohio, near Cleveland. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from the University of Iowa, followed by a master&#x27;s in the field from Teachers College of Columbia University. In New York, she also studied at the Art Students League.

==Work==
Sturtevant&#x27;s earliest known paintings were made in New York in the late 1950s. In these works, she sliced tubes of paint open, flattened them, and attached them to canvas. Most of these works contain fragments from tubes of several colors of paint, some have additional pencil scribbles and daubs of paint. Sturtevant was close friends with Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, both of whom own paintings from this period.

In 1964, by memorization only, she began to manually reproduce (or &quot;repeat&quot;) paintings and objects created by her contemporaries with results that can immediately be identified with an original, at a point that turned the concept of originality on its head. She initially focused on works by such American artists as Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol. Warhol gave Sturtevant one of his silkscreens so she could produce her own versions of his &quot;Flowers&quot; paintings, &quot;Warhol Flowers&quot; (1969–70). When asked about his own technique, Warhol once said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. Ask Elaine.&quot; After a Johns flag painting that was a component of Rauschenberg&#x27;s combine &quot;Short Circuit&quot; was stolen, Rauschenberg commissioned Sturtevant to paint a reproduction, which was subsequently incorporated into the combine. In the late 1960s, Sturtevant concentrated on replicating works by Joseph Beuys and Marcel Duchamp. In a 1967 photograph, she and Rauschenberg pose as a nude Adam and Eve, roles originally played by Duchamp and Brogna Perlmutter in a 1924 picture shot by Man Ray.

In the early 1970s, Sturtevant stopped exhibiting art for more than 10 years. Pushback on her conceptual practice had begun, in fact, with Oldenburg and his dealer, Leo Castelli, being publicly upset at her restaging of Oldenburg&#x27;s &quot;The Store&quot; (1961) as &quot;The Store of Claes Oldenburg&quot; in 1967, just a few blocks away from where the original had been staged. As critic Eleanor Heartney wrote, &quot;Sturtevant found her work met with resistance and even hostility. Her frustration culminated with a 1973 show at the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York. Titled “Sturtevant: Studies done for Beuys’ Action and objects, Duchamps’ etc. Including film,” the exhibition encompassed three rooms of objects and three of her early films that played off Warhol, Beuys and Duchamp. It was met with a deafening silence from the art world, precipitating her withdrawal.&quot;

From the early 1980s she focused on the next generation of artists, including Robert Gober, Anselm Kiefer, Paul McCarthy, and Felix Gonzalez-Torres. She mastered painting, sculpture, photography and film in order to produce a full range of copies of the works of her chosen artists. In most cases, her decision to start copying an artist happened before those artists achieved broader recognition. Nearly all of the artists she chose to copy are today considered iconic for their time or style. This has given rise to discussions among art critics on how it had been possible for Sturtevant to identify those artists at such an early stage.

In 1991, Sturtevant presented an entire show consisting of her repetition of Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Flowers&quot; series.

Her later works mainly focus on reproductions in the digital age. Sturtevant commented on her work at her 2012 retrospective &quot;Sturtevant: Image over Image&quot; at the Moderna Museet: &quot;What is currently compelling is our pervasive cybernetic mode, which plunks copyright into mythology, makes origins a romantic notion, and pushes creativity outside the self. Remake, reuse, reassemble, recombine—that&#x27;s the way to go.&quot;

After feeling misunderstood by critics and artists, Sturtevant stopped making art for a decade. Her 2014 exhibition at MoMA was the first significant exhibition in the US in decades. Her last large-scale installation, &quot;The House of Horrors&quot;, has been on temporary display at the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris since June 2015.

&quot;In some ways, style is her medium. She was the first postmodern artist—before the fact—and also the last&quot;, according to Peter Eleey, curator of her 2014 MoMA exhibition.

==Later life==

One of Sturtevant&#x27;s final acts of subversion was her recurring performance of a visiting artist&#x27;s public lecture. The lecture was not based on any particular artist, but on the meta-tropes of everything that can go wrong (and does) in a typical visiting artist&#x27;s lecture. The crux of the lecture is Sturtevant&#x27;s portrayal of a bitter, possibly drunk, late-career artist who cannot get any of her presentation media to work properly. The slides get stuck, the videos won&#x27;t cue, and the audio won&#x27;t work. The lecture ends with Sturtevant screaming obscenities at her hapless studio assistant in the tech booth and storming off the stage.

Sturtevant died on May 7, 2014, in Paris, where she had been living and working since the early 1990s. She was 89.

==Exhibitions==

Sturtevant had her first her solo exhibition in 1965 at the Bianchini Gallery, in New York. In 1975, a show was dedicated to her by the German art dealer Reinhard Onnasch in his New York gallery.

Solo exhibitions of her work have since been mounted at:
* Württembergischer Kunstverein Stuttgart (1992)
* Deichtorhallen, Hamburg (1992)
* Villa Arson, Nice (1993)
* Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main (2004)
*Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (2010)
*La Biennale di Venezia (2011) 
*Moderna Museet (2012)
*Kunsthalle Zurich (2012)
*Serpentine Galleries (2013)
*Museum of Modern Art (2014) 
*&quot;Sturtevant. Drawing Double Reversal:&quot; Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main/Albertina, Vienna/Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin
*Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (2015) 

==Awards and recognition==

In 2008, Sturtevant received the Francis J. Greenburger Award.

On June 4, 2011, Sturtevant received the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the 54th Venice Biennale.

In September 2013, she was awarded the Kurt Schwitters Prize for Lifetime Achievement by the Sprengel Museum.

Her &quot;Warhol Flowers&quot; (1964-1971) painting series was cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2019 as one of the 25 works of art that defined the contemporary age.

==Art market==
In 2007, an original &quot;Crying Girl&quot; by Roy Lichtenstein sold at auction for $78,400; in 2011, Sturtevant&#x27;s canvas reworking of &quot;Crying Girl&quot;—the only Sturtevant painting of its kind in existence—sold for $710,500. In 2014, &quot;Lichtenstein, Frighten Girl&quot; (1966) sold at Christie&#x27;s for $3.4 million. Shortly after, &quot;Warhol Diptych&quot; (1973) was sold for $5,093,000 at Christie&#x27;s in New York.

<text>Council (Inupiaq: &quot;Kaułiq&quot; or &quot;Akauchak&quot;) is an abandoned townsite in the Nome Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. It has a population of zero as of the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Censuses.

== Geography ==

Council is located at about , about 57 miles east by northeast of Nome. It is located on the banks of the Niukluk River on the central Seward Peninsula.

== History ==
Council was begun in 1898 when gold was discovered near the Ophir Creek. Council and the surrounding area may have had as many as 4,000 inhabitants during the next decade until the gold ran out. Today Council has about 25 old buildings and much old mining equipment, including a dredge, laying about. During the summer, Council is used as a fish camp and a recreational location for residents of Nome and White Mountain.

Council is connected to Nome by a gravel road, the Nome-Council Road. The road is closed during winter. Council is the nearest site to Nome that has trees, and some Nome residents cut spruce trees at Council for use as Christmas trees.

A second, larger, dredge is located at 15 Mile Camp on Ophir Creek. There are several mine buildings on the site, including a powerhouse with a moderate diameter Pelton (undershot) waterwheel. A number of new buildings have been added in recent years, mostly for summer second-home usage. Occasionally one or two people winter at Council. In the Fall of 2004 the telephone lines which had not been used since a brief period of re-habitation in the 1970s were removed by the utility. Utility poles remain in place with wires connecting to a defunct power plant from the same period.

==Demographics==

Council first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as Council City, although it was an unincorporated village. In 1920, the name was shortened to Council. It did not appear on the 1930 census, but returned again in 1940 and 1950. It did not appear again until 1990 when it was classified an Alaska Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA). It has reported a population of zero in 2000 and 2010.

<doc id="1079866" wikidata="Q4364434" url="?curid=1079866" title="Mantle (geology)">
<text>A mantle is a layer inside a planetary body bounded below by a core and above by a crust. Mantles are made of rock or ices, and are generally the largest and most massive layer of the planetary body. Mantles are characteristic of planetary bodies that have undergone differentiation by density. All terrestrial planets (including Earth), half of the giant planets, specifically ice giants, a number of asteroids, and some planetary moons have mantles.

==Examples==
=== Earth ===
The Earth&#x27;s mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core. Its mass of 4.01 × 1024 kg is 67% the mass of the Earth. It has a thickness of making up about 84% of Earth&#x27;s volume. It is predominantly solid, but in geological time it behaves as a viscous fluid. Partial melting of the mantle at mid-ocean ridges produces oceanic crust, and partial melting of the mantle at subduction zones produces continental crust.

=== Other planets ===
Mercury has a silicate mantle approximately thick, constituting only 28% of its mass. Venus&#x27;s silicate mantle is approximately thick, constituting around 70% of its mass. Mars&#x27;s silicate mantle is approximately thick, constituting ~74–88% of its mass, and may be represented by chassignite meteorites. Uranus and Neptune&#x27;s ice mantles are approximately 30,000 km thick, composing 80% of both masses.

=== Moons ===
Jupiter&#x27;s moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede have silicate mantles; Io&#x27;s ~ silicate mantle is overlain by a volcanic crust, Ganymede&#x27;s ~ thick silicate mantle is overlain by ~ of ice, and Europa&#x27;s ~ km silicate mantle is overlain by ~ of ice and possibly liquid water.

The silicate mantle of the Earth&#x27;s moon is approximately 1300–1400 km thick, and is the source of mare basalts. The lunar mantle might be exposed in the South Pole-Aitken basin or the Crisium basin. The lunar mantle contains a seismic discontinuity at ~ depth, most likely related to a change in composition.

Titan and Triton each have a mantle made of ice or other solid volatile substances.

=== Asteroids ===
Some of the largest asteroids have mantles; for example, Vesta has a silicate mantle similar in composition to diogenite meteorites.

<doc id="1079867" wikidata="Q3364707" url="?curid=1079867" title="International Baby Food Action Network">
<text>The International Baby Food Action Network, IBFAN, consists of public interest groups working around the world to reduce infant and young child morbidity and mortality. IBFAN aims to improve the health and well-being of babies and young children, their mothers and their families through the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding and optimal infant feeding practices. IBFAN works for universal and full implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and Resolutions.

IBFAN was set up in 1979 due to the efforts of various individuals including Gabrielle Palmer through UNICEF and the WHO. The first analysis of Nestlé&#x27;s marketing strategy was published in the magazine New Internationalist in 1973 and in the book The Baby Killer, published by the English non-governmental organisation War On Want in 1974. Nestlé sued the publisher of the German translation (Third World Action Group) for libel. After a two-year trial, the publisher was convicted on the grounds that Nestlé could not be held responsible for infant deaths under criminal law. But since the defence was only fined 300 Swiss francs, and judge Jürg Sollberger pointed out that Nestlé needed to fundamentally change its advertising methods, Time magazine wrote that it was a moral victory for the defence.

In 1981, the 34th General Assembly of the World Health Organisation adopted resolution WHA34.22, which included the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. The Code contains restrictions on the marketing of breast-milk substitutes, such as infant formula, to ensure that mothers are not discouraged from breast-feeding and that substitutes are used safely when necessary. The code also covers feeding bottles and teats. It also contains recommendations on the labelling of infant formula and other breast-milk substitutes.

In 1998 IBFAN received the Right Livelihood Award. The RLA Jury has honoured IBFAN “for its committed and effective campaigning over nearly twenty years for the rights of mothers to choose to breastfeed their babies, in the full knowledge of the health benefits of breastmilk, and free from the commercial pressure and misinformation with which companies promote breastmilk substitutes.”

IBFAN&#x27;s principles are:
#The right of infants everywhere to have the highest level of health.
#The right of families, and in particular women and children, to have enough nutritious food.
#The right of women to breastfeed and to make informed choices about infant feeding.
#The right of women to full support for successful breastfeeding and for sound infant feeding practices.
#The right of all people to health services which meet basic needs.
#The right of health workers and consumers to health care systems which are free of commercial pressures.
#The right of people to organise in international solidarity to secure changes which protect and promote basic health.

<text>August Blanche (17 September 1811 – 30 November 1868) was a Swedish journalist, novelist, and politician.

==Life==
August Theodor Blanche was born in Stockholm, Sweden, the illegitimate child of a servant girl and a priest. His mother eventually married Johan Jacob Blanck, a blacksmith, and the boy took his stepfather&#x27;s name. A brilliant student, in 1838 he obtained a law degree and for a time, worked as a civil servant until taking up journalism. In the early 1840s, he began writing plays for the theater as well as translating plays from foreign languages into Swedish. By the middle of the decade, he was writing novels and short stories of intrigue, all of which met with a great deal of success.

An activist, in 1859 Blanche was elected to the Riksdag of the Estates where he served until 1866. He died of unknown causes two years later, on 30 November 1868, on the way to participate in the unveiling of the statue of King Charles the XII, which he had lobbied for.

August Blanche is interred in the Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

<doc id="1079880" wikidata="Q4970716" url="?curid=1079880" title="British Rail Class 116">
<text>The British Rail Class 116 diesel multiple units were built by BR Derby from 1957 to 1961. Introduced as part of the British Railways Modernisation Plan in the mid 1950s, as with other first generation DMUs the 116 was intended to replace steam trains and reduce costs across the rail network. Alongside Metro-Cammell, BR Derby had prior experience with DMUs, having developed a Lightweight Unit, and so was awarded a contract for a new design.

==Background and design==
BR ordered the type in large numbers but Derby Works could not keep up with demand, with 108 three-car sets being built in all. Variants of the type, British Rail Class 117 and British Rail Class 118 were built by Pressed Steel and the BRC&amp;W respectively under licence. These units were originally ordered for use on suburban and local services in the Birmingham area, but many found their way to other areas such as South Wales.

The type was powered by twin BUT six-cylinder diesel engines, each producing with mechanical transmission. The type came in two or three car formations; in a three-car set, the trailer (centre carriage) was unpowered. Built of an all steel construction, the 116 and its variants were classed as heavyweight DMUs but were capable of speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h).

Like other BR Derby output, the type underwent testing on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway which had been closed to passenger trains by the mid 1950s.

The class were similar in design to the Class 114, sharing the same heavyweight steel chassis but were fitted out as high-density sets, built for short-distance, high-capacity services, and so were built without gangways or toilets, although gangways were later fitted on some units. The Class 117 and 118 types were equipped with toilets however. They were originally capable of accommodating 262 passengers. On introduction, they were heavily marketed based on their appeal to commuters, and offered cheap fares.

Some sources claim that the Class 116 had issues such as poor ride and weak build quality, causing difficulties in later service.

==Regular use==

===West Midlands===

Twenty nine 116 units (50050-50078, 59000-59028 and 50092-50120) were first introduced into service on 17 June 1957, operating from Birmingham Snow Hill. The 116 was used extensively around the commuter belts of Birmingham before being used on longer routes to Oxford and Worcester from spring, 1958. The type was a familiar sight on the Cross City Line, the Rugby–Birmingham–Stafford line and across the West Midlands for the next thirty years, including services between Leamington Spa and Stratford-Upon-Avon. Several units were painted in West Midlands PTE livery.

The 116s were refurbished several times in their lifetime, but with the electrification of the Cross City Line, the type was wound down in the area along with the Class 101, with which it worked in tandem with. Withdrawal started from November 1992 and they were fully replaced by EMUs on 12 July 1993.

From the mid 1960s, surplus units were transferred to the Eastern and Scottish Regions. The first three Class 116 units were transferred to Scotland in October 1966, initially on-loan to Hamilton depot, but the move became permanent in November, and by December that year eight units were based at Hamilton.

===Scotland===
The Scottish 116 units were put to work immediately. Initially with eight sets available, they worked out of Glasgow Central to East Kilbride, Barrhead, Kilmarnock, Kilmacolm, sometimes reaching Largs and Edinburgh via Shotts. By July 1972, a total of fourteen sets were in service. The class was repainted in Trans Clyde livery, and were used on longer routes between Glasgow and Ayr.

Hamilton Depot closed in August 1982 and so the class 116 fleet was reallocated to Eastfield. In theory the units were out-based at Corkerhill, continuing to work services out of Glasgow Central. After electrification, the 116&#x27;s were phased out of use. The last 116 unit left service in Scotland in March 1987, being returned to the Birmingham area in favour of the Class 107 which returned to service after an overhaul of the fleet.

===South Wales===
The 116 was extensively used in South Wales, being belatedly introduced on 2 December 1957 in the Cardiff Valley region. Originally intended to be introduced in September, a lack of vehicles caused the delay into service. They were housed at Canton depot. Just as in the Birmingham region, the new trains were heavily advertised. The units were used for the next 30 years almost exclusively in the South Wales area, but did occasionally work services to Bristol and Bath.

With the introduction of Sprinters, the 116 became obsolete and were slowly withdrawn from service in favour of British Rail Class 150s starting in 1987. The final 116s were withdrawn from Wales on 18 September 1992.

===Eastern Region===
The Eastern region based 116 units were based at Stratford, running services to and from Liverpool Street and Kings Cross. They had been transferred from the Western region with a view to running a Kings Cross - Cambridge all DMU service. A delay in introducing new trains to the London region from the Chiltern area saw the 116 pressed into service to fill the gap.

==Later use==
The 116 fleet and its variants were extensively refurbished in the late 1970s. The carriages were renovated with new interiors including gangways, improved lighting and improvements to the onboard heating. The work was awarded to BR Swindon. The type was subsequently seen in use everywhere from Tyneside to Devon.

Still in extensive use across the West Midlands during the 1980s, eventually the 116s were joined by brand new Class 150 trains beginning in 1984, with the aim of phasing out the older DMU.
By the early 1990s, the 116 units had aged to the point where hybrid sets were created from available serviceable stock. The 116 had originally been designed for short-distance commuter services, so did not have a toilet. Hybrid sets usually had a toilet to overcome this problem. They stayed in regular service until 1990, when they began to be withdrawn from traffic along with other first generation types. The age of the trains along with concerns about corrosion and the asbestos used during the initial building and subsequent renovations were the reasons given.

They were gradually replaced on regional services by the new &quot;Sprinter&quot; derivative units, or by Class 323 electric multiple units on services around Birmingham, with several units still being used until the final day of diesel running before electrification. The remaining units in use were transferred to Tyseley depot to partially replace the retired British Rail Class 114 and their workings in Lincolnshire.

The final units lasted in traffic until around June 1995. 
However, a few saw further use in departmental service, as sandite or route-learner units. Several of this class have been saved for preservation.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 16 November 1960, W50083/W59033/W50125 which was operating a journey from Neath to Treherbert when the leading car, W50125 was struck by a runaway coal train headed by ex-GWR pannier tank 9737, on the single line track at Pontrhydyfen Junction. The driver was killed.
* On 11 June 1974, Set 152 was involved in a fatal accident at Pollokshield East when it was in collision with Class 311 EMU no 108. The cab end of SC50874 was severely damaged, and was never repaired, with the vehicle officially withdrawn 16/2/76.
* In early hours of 3 August 1983, Set 116391 was being returned from a Works visit, conveyed on the rear of a parcels train from London, when it derailed and caught fire at Portobello on the East Coast Main Line. As the vehicles were asbestos contaminated the unit was withdrawn in October 1983 and eventually disposed of by burial in Paterson&#x27;s Tip, Mount Vernon in July 1984.

==Pacer substitution==

Several units were allocated to Heaton TMD in the late 1980s to carry out Pacer replacement services during the latter&#x27;s troubled introduction period. During this time, the individual cars were often mixed into hybrid sets with, for example, class 119 vehicles. Services worked included Bishop Auckland to Saltburn.

==Parcels use==
Three units were converted to carry parcels traffic and reclassified as Class 130, though the individual coaches were not renumbered. The units involved were:
* 50819 + 50872
* 50862 + 50915
* 51137 + 51150
* W50915 reverted to standard Class 116 configuration in 1977 and transferred to Tyseley
To provide extra capacity, they worked with modified General Utility Vans (GUV) as centre trailers.

==Preservation==
5 vehicles have been preserved on heritage railways.

===Preserved then scrapped===
In addition, the following vehicles were previously preserved at the Swansea Vale Railway, but were scrapped in 2009 due to an arson attack.

*DMBS 51134/5
*DMS 51147/8
*TC 59445

<doc id="1079881" wikidata="Q1106136" url="?curid=1079881" title="Lantern shield">
<text>The lantern shield is a small shield combined with a lantern used during the Italian Renaissance (15th and 16th century Italy) especially for night time duels. A number of specimens survive. Their defining feature is a small circular shield – a buckler – combined with a lantern, or a hook from which to hang a lantern, intended to blind the opponent at night or in duels fought at dawn.

Some more elaborate examples might incorporate gauntlets, spikes, sword blades, and also a mechanism to alternatively darken or release the light of the lantern.

The most peculiar example is the one now kept at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, made in the 1540s.

Swordsmen dueling at dawn are reported to have carried lanterns during the 16th and 17th centuries, and fencing manuals of the period integrated the lantern into their lessons, using it to parry blows and blind the opponent. The manuals sometimes show the combatants carrying the lantern in the left hand wrapped behind the back.

It is believed that the lantern shield was never actually used in combat, but rather for patrolling Italian city streets at night.

The lantern halberd and lantern pistol are other weapons with an integrated lantern. The lantern pistol is an 18th or 19th century flintlock pistol shield and there are two known versions.

<doc id="1079885" wikidata="Q6395971" url="?curid=1079885" title="Kevin Campbell (politician)">
<text>Kevin Thomas Campbell is a former New Zealand member of parliament for the Alliance, and the party&#x27;s leader outside of Parliament at its deregistration in May 2015.

==Early career==
Campbell worked as a milkman, before becoming a police officer. He trained to be a Catholic priest at Holy Name Seminary and Holy Cross College. However he was not ordained. Prior to entering Parliament he qualified as a Barrister and Solicitor and practiced in criminal law.

==Member of Parliament==

Campbell was the Alliance candidate for the 1998 Taranaki-King Country by-election, and claimed to have &quot;played some small part in bringing about the closer working relationship between Labour and the Alliance as a result of that by-election.&quot;

He was a member of the Alliance, having been elected to Parliament as a list MP in the 1999 election, where he stood in the electorate and was placed tenth on the Alliance list.

In April 2002, the Alliance party split between a moderate faction and a leftist faction, with Campbell remaining with the Alliance as part of the latter. He initially committed to appearing on the Alliance&#x27;s party list but withdrew on 11 June 2002. The party lost representation due to not reaching the 5% vote threshold.

<text>Nicholas Andrew Argyll Campbell OBE (born Nicholas Lackey; 10 April 1961) is a Scottish broadcaster and journalist. He has worked in television and radio since 1981 and as a network presenter with BBC Radio since 1987.

==Early life==
Campbell was born in Portobello, Edinburgh, on 10 April 1961, and was taken for adoption at just a few days old. His biological parents were both Irish. His unmarried mother, Stella Lackey, originally from Longford, was an Irish Protestant matron at a Dublin hospital. She was single when Campbell was conceived during a secretive affair. She travelled from Ireland to Edinburgh, where she gave birth to her son. His biological father, Eugene Hughes, was a Catholic policeman, 14 years Stella&#x27;s junior, and was an Irish Republican from Belfast. Eighteen months before Nicky was born, Stella gave birth to his half-sister, Esther, also taken for adoption.

His adoptive mother, Sheila, was a psychiatric social worker, and his adoptive father, Frank, a publisher of maps. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, an independent school. In July 2022 he disclosed that he witnessed and experienced sexual and violent physical abuse there, which had a &quot;profound effect on [his] life&quot;. He studied History at the University of Aberdeen and graduated with a 2:1 degree.

==Career==
===Radio===

In his 2021 memoir, &quot;One of the Family&quot;, Campbell describes his lifelong obsession with radio and how he and his best friend at the time, the actor Iain Glen, would call various Radio Forth phone-in shows pretending to be different characters.

He started working for Northsound Radio in Aberdeen while still at university there, making commercials and writing jingles. In 1983 he was offered his own show, &quot;The World of Opera&quot;, which aired every Sunday night at 9pm. On one occasion the DJ presenting the late-night pop show after him did not turn up and Campbell had to provide cover. Shortly after this he was offered the station&#x27;s breakfast show, which he presented until 1986, when he sent a tape to Capital Radio in London and was given the Saturday afternoon show. He then took over the weekend breakfast show from Roger Scott and was used as a daytime &quot;dep&quot; for all the main daytime programmes.

The Capital Radio roster at the time included Roger Scott, Kenny Everett, Alan Freeman, Chris Tarrant and David &quot;Kid&quot; Jensen. It was while standing in for Tarrant and also Jensen that the Head of Music at BBC Radio 1, Doreen Davis, poached him from Capital, and he joined the network in October 1987.

He first presented the late-night Saturday programme but was soon moved to the weekend early show. Towards the end of 1988 he was offered the weekday late night slot which was named &quot;Into the Night&quot;. He played a wide variety of music and hosted an eclectic selection of guests for long interviews. These included Frank Zappa, David Icke, John Major, the Bee Gees and the Reverend Ian Paisley. He was also regularly joined by Frankie Howerd in the last years of the comedian&#x27;s life. In August 1993, Campbell also briefly took over a Sunday morning show, following the on-air resignation of Dave Lee Travis.

Campbell left the network briefly in October 1993 to care for his sick wife. He then returned in January 1994 to present the weekday &quot;Drivetime&quot; show, and in 1995, he took over the afternoon show.

In 1997 he joined the news and sport network BBC Radio 5 Live, when offered the job by Roger Mosey, the station&#x27;s head. He presented the mid-morning phone in show for five years before replacing Julian Worricker in the breakfast slot in January 2003, co-presenting initially with Victoria Derbyshire. In 2001, when Radio 2 wanted a replacement for Jimmy Young, he said that he was the BBC&#x27;s choice and detailed a series of meetings between himself and the controller of Radio 2. However, the BBC later said that Campbell had initiated the meetings himself, and his public revelations about private negotiations was criticised by Director General Greg Dyke. From 2004 to 2011, he co-presented the programme with Shelagh Fogarty. In May 2011, Fogarty left the breakfast show and was replaced by Rachel Burden. Campbell started presenting a one hour at 9am phone-in &quot;Your Call&quot; after the main show. Burden and Campbell presented together until 2021, when Campbell moved to a two-hour phone-in programme from 9am to 11am every weekday morning.

Between April and October 2023 his show was broadcast on the BBC News Channel, the iPlayer and BBC Two.

His radio career also includes notable work for Radio 2. In January 2019 Campbell presented &quot;Engelbert; 60 years of song&quot;, a musical retrospective and in-depth interview with Engelbert Humperdink. Following the success of that programme he interviewed Francis Rossi of Status Quo for another Radio 2 special – &quot;Here we Are and Here We Go&quot; which was broadcast in May 2019. In August of that year, as part of the Radio 2 Beatles pop-up station he presented an hour-long interview live from Abbey Road studios with Giles Martin – &quot;A Day in the Life – Nicky Campbell meets Giles Martin&quot;.

In his time at Radio 5 Live, Campbell has covered four Olympic Games, three Football World Cups and three European Championships and every general election and referendum since 1997. He has won many awards for his radio work. In 1999 he was voted Variety Club Radio Personality of the year. He has won several Sony Awards, including five gold, and in 2017 he and Rachel Burden won the Aria Award for &quot;Best Speech Presenter Breakfast&quot;.

In 2014 Campbell was inducted into the Arqiva Radio Academy Hall of Fame, which recognises the &quot;immense contribution that celebrated broadcasters and presenters have made to UK audio and radio over many years.&quot;

===Television===
In 1986, he had a short stint on &quot;Music Box&quot;, the pan-European 24-hour cable and satellite television channel while he was with Capital Radio.

Campbell&#x27;s first mainstream television was shortly after he joined Radio 1 in 1987 when he hosted a pop quiz on Grampian Television, &quot;The Video Jukebox&quot;. The team captains were Gaz Top and Jaki Graham.

In 1989, he presented the channel &quot;Travelling Talk Show&quot; from Volgograd in the Soviet Union. The audience discussion programme addressed the implications of reform under Mikhail Gorbachev and the effects of &quot;Glasnost&quot; and &quot;Perestroika&quot; on ordinary Soviet citizens. The &quot;Travelling Talk Show&quot; also went to Bogotá to hear from ordinary Colombians about Pablo Escobar, the Medellín and Cali cartels, and the country&#x27;s narcotics wars.

From 1988 to 1997, Campbell was on the roster of regular presenters of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on BBC1.

In 1990, he worked again for Grampian Television, making &quot;You&#x27;d Better Believe It&quot;, a quick-fire trivia quiz identifying &quot;some very famous faces&quot;.

When the British rights to the &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; were secured by Scottish Television, Campbell got the presenting job after piloting against Eamonn Holmes, and he hosted the show from 1988 to 1996. His co-presenters were first Angela Ekaette, then Carol Smillie, and for his final season, Jenny Powell. The programme, made prior to satellite broadcasting, aired on ITV reaching audiences of up to 12 million. The UK broadcast rights for the old episodes have in recent years been secured by Challenge TV, and all eight series he presented are regularly shown on the free-to-air network.

In 1992, he anchored &quot;Goal&quot; on Sky TV. This was a World Cup-based football quiz featuring teams comprising Geoff Hurst, Martin O&#x27;Neill and Terry Yorath and in which Campbell posed questions on footage from previous tournaments.

In 1993, he studio-anchored the &quot;Big Race&quot;, an ITV adventure show in which a team led by the former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter Peter Duncan drove overland across Europe to Russia, ending up in Siberia and finally crossing the Bering Strait through Alaska and then on to New York months after starting out.

Also in 1993, Campbell hosted &quot;Strictly Classified&quot; for Granada Television. This was a studio-based magazine show centred around quirky stories from the classified ads in local newspapers. His co-hosts were Pauline Daniels and Jeff Green.

In 1995, he made the &quot;Nicky Campbell Show&quot;, a short-lived chat and entertainment programme for BBC Scotland, and in 1996, was a presenter/reporter on &quot;Ride On&quot;, the Channel 4 motoring magazine.

He made a film for the BBC Two documentary series &quot;Leviathan&quot; in 1998 entitled &quot;Braveheart,&quot; in which he looked at Edward I of England and William Wallace and explored the historical roots of Scottish antipathy, real or imagined, towards the English.

In 1999, he was one of the presenters of the Rugby World Cup for ITV.

Between 1990 and 2001, he presented &quot;Central Weekend&quot; (also called &quot;Central Weekend Live&quot;), the influential and controversial late-night debate show on Friday night in the Central Television region. Known for the confrontational nature of its studio audience and provocative topics, Campbell was the main presenter but over the years co-presenters on the debate show included Anna Soubry, Adrian Mills, Sue Jay, Claudia Winkleman, Kaye Adams, John Stapleton, Roger Cook, Paul Ross and Sheila Ferguson. During one debate, Campbell was attacked live on camera by an irate participant in a debate on women&#x27;s football. Campbell had reprimanded him for using a misogynistic term, threatening him with the &quot;red card&quot;. The assailant, Robert Davey, was subsequently charged and given a 12-month prison sentence.

London&#x27;s ITV franchise Carlton Television and also network ITV made versions of the programme, &quot;Carlton Live&quot; and &quot;Thursday Night Live&quot;, which were shown between 1996 and 2002. These were also hosted by Campbell. He presented one series with Richard Littlejohn and then all subsequent ones with Andrew Neil.

In 2001, he took over as presenter/reporter on &quot;Watchdog&quot;, the long-running consumer affairs show. He remained there until 2009 when he and Julia Bradbury were replaced by Anne Robinson. Before Bradbury his co-host had been Kate Gerbeau.

In 2006, Campbell appeared in the singing show &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;, with Beverley Knight.

In 2007, Campbell returned to the game show world for &quot;The Rest of Your Life&quot; on ITV, a show devised by Dick de Rijk who also created &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. It first aired on ITV in May 2007. In each game, a couple tried to win a prize consisting of a series of monthly cheques whose length and value were determined by random choices of which squares on the studio floor to light up.

Campbell featured in an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; that aired 11 July 2007, where he was seen tracing his adoptive family&#x27;s roots in Scotland and Australia. The research also uncovered his father&#x27;s involvement in the Battle of Kohima in 1944.

Campbell hosted &quot;The Big Questions&quot;, an ethical and religious debate show which ran on BBC One on Sunday morning for 14 series between 2007 and 2021. This amounted to almost 900 studio debates.

In 2009, he presented the second series of the BBC Two quiz show &quot;Battle of the Brains.&quot;

2011 was when &quot;Long Lost Family&quot; came to British television, a show which he has presented with Davina McCall through 14 series. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Carole Midgley wrote of the show; &quot;Nicky Campbell and Davina McCall have the knack of squeezing out enough emotion to make it a full box of Kleenex show, but stopping short of it being too schmaltzy. Stories this gobsmacking need no ramping up.&quot; The programme has launched over 700 searches for missing relatives. It remains one of ITV&#x27;s highest rating factual shows. Campbell and McCall also present &quot;Long Lost Family – What Happened Next&quot; and &quot;Long Lost Family – Born without Trace&quot; which helps foundlings abandoned as babies. The team, led by Ariel Bruce, solve the mystery of their beginnings through DNA testing and detective work.

In 2021, Campbell presented &quot;Manhunt: The Raoul Moat Story&quot; on ITV1. This was the inside story of how Moat was tracked down, all in the glare of 24-hour rolling news. In June 2023, Campbell&#x27;s documentary made by Summer Film, &quot;Secrets of the Bay City Rollers&quot;, was released on ITV, STV and ITVX. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as &quot;one of the most disturbing accounts of abuse imaginable…a sensitively told tale of horrific cruelty&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; said it was &quot;brave&quot; and &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;moving&quot;. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; review described the documentary as &quot;horribly fascinating…..a story of unimaginable horror&quot;.

In November 2023, Campbell presented the State Opening of Parliament for the BBC from the Palace of Westminster.

=== Podcasts ===
Campbell&#x27;s podcast &quot;One of Family&quot; won the Dog Desk Radio award in 2021 for Best Animal Related Podcast and frequently reached the number 1 spot in the Apple Podcasts Pets and Animal charts for Great Britain. Guests have included Ricky Gervais, Gary Lineker, Robbie Savage, Jeremy Paxman, Lorraine Kelly, Chris Packham, Sara Cox, Kevin Bridges and Deborah Meaden.

In June 2022 the BBC launched his podcast &quot;Different&quot; for Radio 5 Live on BBC Sounds, in which he interviews people who have had unusual experiences, beliefs or careers. His many guests have included David MacMillan, the only Westerner to escape Bangkok&#x27;s infamous Klong Prem Prison, a Scottish witch, journalist Paul Salopek who has been walking the route of human evolution for a decade and broadcaster Iain Lee on his experiences with ADHD – an episode also featuring Campbell&#x27;s daughter Kirsty, who has ADHD.

In July 2022 Campbell interviewed journalist Alex Renton on &quot;Different&quot;, and Campbell revealed he had witnessed and experienced abuse at his school The Edinburgh Academy. Campbell wrote an article for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; on the same day as the podcast&#x27;s release. The revelations made headlines all over the world and increased pressure on the Scottish prosecution services to extradite one of the alleged abusers from South Africa, referred to as Edgar in the podcast and press because of a ruling on anonymity by the ongoing Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. &quot;Edgar&quot; features heavily including Day 261 of the inquiry, in which he is referred to as &quot;CDZ&quot;. After the podcast was released dozens more men came forward and the police opened an investigation solely relating to the Edinburgh Academy, Operation Tree Frog. Renton reported that because of the publicity ex-pupils of Edinburgh Academy had named 17 other staff members, employed between the 1950s and 1980s, as physical and sexual abusers.

In September 2022 Campbell and Renton were asked to appear on the South African current affairs programme &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; to talk about &quot;Edgar&quot;, who was living in a comfortable retirement village near Cape Town. His appeal against extradition is ongoing. In January 2023 the SNP MP Ian Blackford used Parliamentary Privilege to identify Iain Wares as &quot;Edgar&quot;. On 7 March 2023, Lady Smith, chair of the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry, passed down the judgement that Wares could be widely named.

Other notable podcast appearances by Campbell include James O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Full Disclosure.&quot; The two broadcasters discussed their experiences of adoption and the effect on their lives and mental health.

He appeared in Michael Fenton Stevens&#x27; podcast &quot;My Time Capsule&quot; in June 2021, on which talked about Charlie Brooker attacking him in the press and television over a number of years, including an expletive-laden monologue in 2009 which put him in bed for two days. Campbell said,

&quot;I&#x27;ve suffered from terrible depression since I can remember — probably since I was a teenager, and I have bipolar disorder type 2. It sent me into a really, really low ebb and I was suffering badly at the time, anyway. Of course I can take people having a go and having a bit of craic and insulting you — it goes with the game. But this was visceral. Really, really visceral and really vicious and really horrible.&quot;

In the 2023 British Podcast Awards his podcast &quot;Different&quot; won the award for best interview podcast. The winning episode was his conversation with Jenny Pearson, the daughter of the teacher who sexually abused him at the Edinburgh Academy.

===Music===
Campbell is a self-taught musician and plays piano, guitar and ukulele.

After composing songs for Aberdeen University Theatre on Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Campbell started writing music for radio jingles and commercials at Northsound Radio in 1981, while still at college.

In 1996 while at Radio 1 he won a Sony Award (silver) for his original compositions for the BBC Radio One Afternoon Show he presented at the time.

In 2009, after meeting the actor Mark Moraghan, Campbell wrote a swing album for him, &quot;Moonlight&#x27;s Back in Style&quot;, which was released by Linn Records.

He also appeared on the album singing some backing vocals and the two of them performed the track &quot;Through it All&quot; on Children in Need.

&quot;Through It All&quot; was also covered by The Ukuleles on their debut album released by Demon Music.

In 2014 Campbell co-wrote the album &quot;Just Passing Through&quot; with Kate Robbins, which was released in July of that year. They both appeared on the record.

He composed the original theme music for &quot;The Big Questions&quot;, the BBC One Sunday morning debate show which ran from 2007 to 2021.

In 2017 Campbell was asked to write the song &quot;Sacred Eyes&quot; for the 40th anniversary of the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and a video about the famous elephant orphanage. The music was performed by Kit Morgan and Logan Wilson with a string quartet arranged by Paul Buck.

He has written all the music for his podcast about dogs, &quot;One of the Family&quot;, and also for the BBC Radio 5 Live podcast &quot;Different&quot;.

In May 2024 he set up Nicky Campbell Music on all the streaming sites as an outlet for music he has written and co-written including all his compositions for podcasts.

Campbell is a company director of Mhor Music Ltd., an original music company producing bespoke and original music for film, television, corporate media, online content and Mhor Productions Ltd. In summer 2022 he directed and shot the video for Dark Night by APECCS featuring George Fenton CBE.

=== Writing and published books ===
Campbell has written for a wide variety of journals and publications. He wrote a music column for the &quot;Scottish Sunday Mail&quot; between 1987 and 1989 and a regular sports column for &quot;the Guardian&quot; between 2006 and 2007. He has written for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;the Sunday Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;the New Statesman&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;the Mail on Sunday&quot;, &quot;the Observer&quot; and the &quot;Press Gazette&quot; amongst many.

He has authored two books. His first &#x27;&quot;Blue-Eyed Son – The Story of an Adoption&quot;&#x27;, came out in 2004. In this he described the search for both his birth parents and meeting his birth mother Stella Lackey in 1989 and birth father Eugene Hughes in 2002. His birth mother, a nurse from a Dublin Protestant family was 36 when she had the brief affair and Eugene Hughes, a Dublin policeman from a Catholic South Armagh family, was 21. Campbell also discovered that his grandfather had been in the IRA in 1919–1921, and his biological father had been active in the IRA of the 1950s. When reports emerged prior to publication that his father was a committed Irish Republican, as his father had been before him, Stella&#x27;s nephew and her elderly sister, by then very ill, were doorstepped by the English tabloid press. Stella&#x27;s family had no idea who their aunt&#x27;s brief and obviously secret lover in 1960 had been or anything about his religious or political background and were panicked into a denial. When the book came out Campbell wrote about his birth father&#x27;s background and all was explained in chapters 13, 14, 15 and 16 of Blue-Eyed Son. Both sides of his birth families helped with and contributed to the book. His birth father&#x27;s own cousin Tony Hughes had been shot by the British Army in Armagh in 1973.

In the book, given his own birth parents&#x27; experience, Campbell explored in some detail the cultural and social taboos of inter-religious relationships in the 1950s and 1960s. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; review described Blue-Eyed Son as &quot;an intimate, extraordinary and often tender memoir&quot;. The Scotsman said it was &quot;astonishingly honest . . . one man&#x27;s set of raw, moving and resonant truths&quot;. The Independent described it as &quot;an extraordinary story&quot;.

His second book, &quot;the Sunday Times&quot; Bestseller, &quot;One of the Family – Why a Dog Called Maxwell Changed My Life&quot;, came out in 2021. In this he addressed his complex relationship with his birth mother and the guilt he carried towards his adoptive parents for needing to trace her. He described his emotional breakdown and late diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and how his beloved Labrador Maxwell&#x27;s unconditional love had helped him. In &quot;The Times&quot; Andrew Billen described it as &quot;A remarkable autobiography&quot;.

&quot;The Daily Express&quot; said it had &quot;Commendable honesty . . . a poignant book about the search for belonging&quot; and the broadcaster and journalist James O&#x27;Brien said that the book has &quot;a lesson for all of us and delivers a resounding message of hope and of love&quot;.

== Campaigning for animals ==
A lifelong dog lover, Campbell is a vocal advocate for animals, writing and campaigning for rights, welfare and conservation. After awakening to the desperate plight of the African elephant he began campaigning with Will Travers of the Born Free Foundation and the writer and campaigner Dominic Dyer to raise awareness of the issue and campaign to ban the ivory trade. He has written extensively on the subject.

He regularly attends the Global March for Elephants and Rhinos, held in cities across the world and frequently speaks at the event.

He has also campaigned for and supported the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Kenya, is a patron of the Born Free Foundation and supports a number of animal and conservation charities including Animals Asia, The Born Free Foundation, and the Jane Goodall Institute.

In 2020 he won a prestigious Animal Star Ward for campaigning for animals and raising awareness.

In 2021 he presented the BBC One appeal for Hearing Dogs for Deaf People.

Campbell is also an active supporter of Guide Dogs UK. He hosted their presentation in the main arena at Crufts in 2022.

==Honours==
On 4 December 2008, Campbell received an Honorary Doctorate from the Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen.

Campbell was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 Birthday Honours, for his services to children and adoption.

In 2016 he was given an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Aberdeen.

==Personal life==
Campbell met his first wife Linda Larnach, a divorcee eight years his senior with two sons, whilst working at Northsound Radio in Aberdeen. They married on 30 August 1988 at the University of Aberdeen chapel, although lived in Finchley, and took time off in the Virgin Islands.

They moved to North London where he would later nurse her through a health scare and encouraged his young stepsons in their footballing endeavours, hosting auctions to raise funds for their local amateur club. During their marriage he traced his birth mother Stella in 1989. He reportedly took time out from his career during Larnach&#x27;s illness. When they subsequently separated she gave interviews in which she said his career break had been a publicity stunt.

Campbell married his second wife, the journalist Christina &quot;Tina&quot; Ritchie, on 13 December 1997 in Chelsea.

A former presenter of Radio 1 &quot;Newsbeat&quot;, Ritchie is now a newsreader on BBC Radio 4. The couple live in Balham and have a home in Glenelg in the Scottish Highlands. They have four daughters. Following the birth of four children of his own with Ritchie, he decided in 2002 to find his Irish biological father.

In 2004, Campbell wrote &quot;Blue-Eyed Son – Story of an Adoption&quot;, his account of being adopted and tracing both his birth parents and his extended families in Ireland, on both sides of the religious divide. His birth mother Stella died in 2008 in Dublin. Campbell was a coffin bearer and spoke at her Dublin funeral. His birth father Eugene died in 2021 in County Leitrim. As a result of his books and his work promoting adoption, he was asked to become a Patron of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) and more recently an Ambassador for Adoption UK. Campbell&#x27;s adoptive father Frank died in 1996 of pancreatic cancer.

Campbell has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, his birth mother also had the condition and has candidly discussed his depression.

In 2021 he wrote the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Bestseller &quot;One of the Family&quot; – &quot;Why A Dog Called Maxwell Changed My Life.&quot; The book was dedicated to his adoptive mother Sheila. On 12 December 2019, Campbell announced via social media that she had died at the age of 96. The tweet was widely reported.

<text>The Otranto Barrage was an Allied naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto between Brindisi in Italy and Corfu on the Greek side of the Adriatic Sea in the First World War. The operation consisted of over 200 vessels at the height of the blockade. The blockade was intended to prevent the Austro-Hungarian Navy from escaping into the Mediterranean and threatening Allied operations there. The blockade was effective in preventing surface ships from escaping the Adriatic, but it had little or no effect on the submarines based at Cattaro.

==Blockade attempt==
The Adriatic is wide at the Otranto Straits. The blockade consisted of over 200 vessels at its height, mainly British and French. A main force of up to 60 drifters were dedicated to anti-submarine operations. The drifters were mostly British and typically armed with a 6-pounder gun and depth charges. In 1915 when the blockade was begun, two divisions of 20 would be on patrol at a time, equipped with steel indicator nets intended to trap submarines or at least alert the surface vessels to their presence. A third division would be at Brindisi. The drifters were supported by destroyers and aircraft. However, the demands of the Gallipoli Campaign and other naval operations left the Otranto Barrage with insufficient resources to deter the U-boats, and only the Austro-Hungarian was caught by the indicator nets during the course of the war. It was later considered that the straits had simply been too wide to be netted, mined or patrolled effectively.

The ease with which German and Austrian submarines continued out of the Austro-Hungarian ports in spite of the barrage (and the success they had in disrupting shipping in the whole of the Mediterranean) strongly embarrassed the Allies, the system being called &quot;a large sieve through which U-boats could pass with impunity&quot;. In 1917–1918, reinforcements from the Australian and American navies brought the blockading force up to 35 destroyers, 52 drifters and more than 100 other vessels. Nevertheless, submarines continued to slip through until the end of the war; the introduction of the convoy system and better coordination amongst the Allies only helped to cut the losses they were causing after escaping the blockade.

By contrast, the presence of Allied capital ships involved in the blockade was generally successful in its mission of keeping enemy surface vessels from leaving the Adriatic Sea.

==Raids and battles==
The Austrians mounted nighttime raids against the barrage, five in 1915, nine in 1916 and ten in 1917. After a raid by four s in December 1916, a conference in London concluded that the drifters were insufficiently defended. The barrage was placed under the command of a British officer, Commodore Algernon Walker-Heneage-Vivian, who was able to call upon all Allied ships not in use elsewhere. His second-in-command was another British officer, Commander Charles Edward Turle. The largest raid was carried out on the night of 14/15 May 1917 by the cruisers , , and supported by the destroyers and and Austro-Hungarian U-boats and , along with German U-boat (operating as Austro-Hungarian U-boat &quot;U-89&quot;). The fleet, commanded by Commodore Miklós Horthy, sank 14 drifters out of 47 on duty, and damaged a further three seriously.

Skipper Joseph Watt was later awarded the Victoria Cross for defending his drifter &quot;Gowanlea&quot; under heavy attack from &quot;Novara&quot;. The British light cruisers and —together with Italian and French destroyers, under command of Italian Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton—steamed from Brindisi to engage the Austrians, resulting in the Battle of the Otranto Straits. The British damaged &quot;Saida&quot; and disabled &quot;Novara&quot;, severely injuring Horthy. However, the British cruisers broke off the engagement when the Italian flag officer received notice of heavy Austrian forces coming out of Cattaro. &quot;Saida&quot; towed &quot;Novara&quot; back to port. &quot;Dartmouth&quot; was damaged by &quot;UC-25&quot; as it returned to Brindisi. The night before, the same U-boat had laid a minefield at the mouth of Brindisi harbour; the struck one of these mines exiting the harbour the very same day and exploded, sinking with all hands.

In June 1918, Horthy—by now commander-in-chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy—decided to launch an attack on the barrage employing the four s based at Pola, the most modern in the fleet. While &quot;en route&quot; down the Adriatic, the battleship was torpedoed and sunk by an Italian torpedo boat at dawn on 10 June, resulting in the attack being cancelled.

<text>Victor David Sjöström (; 20 September 1879 – 3 January 1960), also known in the United States as Victor Seastrom, was a pioneering Swedish film director, screenwriter, and actor. He began his career in Sweden, before moving to Hollywood in 1924. Sjöström worked primarily in the silent era; his best known films include &quot;The Phantom Carriage&quot; (1921), &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; (1924), and &quot;The Wind&quot; (1928). Sjöström was Sweden&#x27;s most prominent director in the &quot;Golden Age of Silent Film&quot; in Europe. Later in life, he played the leading role in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; (1957).

==Early life==
Victor David Sjöström was born on 20 September 1879 in Årjäng/Silbodal, in the Värmland region of Sweden. He was only a year old when his father, Olof Adolf Sjöström, moved the family to Brooklyn, New York. His mother died in 1886, when he was seven years old. Sjöström returned to Sweden where he lived with relatives in Stockholm, beginning his acting career at 17 as a member of a touring theater company.

==Career==
Drawn from the stage to the fledgling motion picture industry, he made his first film in 1912 under the direction of Mauritz Stiller. Between 1912 and 1923, he directed another forty-one films in Sweden, some of which are now lost. Those surviving include &quot;The Sons of Ingmar&quot; (1919), &quot;Karin, Daughter of Ingmar&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Phantom Carriage&quot; (1921), all based on stories by the Nobel Prize–winning novelist Selma Lagerlöf. Many of his films from the period are marked by subtle character portrayal, fine storytelling and evocative settings in which the Swedish landscape often plays a key psychological role. The naturalistic quality of his films was enhanced by his (then revolutionary) preference for on-location filming, especially in rural and village settings. He is also known as a pioneer of continuity editing in narrative filmmaking.

In 1923, Sjöström accepted an offer from Louis B. Mayer to work in the United States. In Sweden, he had acted in his own films as well as in those for others, but in Hollywood he devoted himself solely to directing. Using an anglicized name, Victor Seastrom, he made the drama film &quot;Name the Man&quot; (1924) based on the Hall Caine novel, &quot;The Master of Man&quot;. He directed stars of the day such as Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, Lillian Gish, Lon Chaney, and Norma Shearer in another eight films in America before his first talkie in 1930. One of these was the 1926 film &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, starring Lillian Gish as the adulterous Hester Prynne.

Uncomfortable with the modifications needed to direct sound films, Victor Sjöström returned to Sweden, where he directed two more films before his final directing effort, an English-language drama filmed in the United Kingdom &quot;Under the Red Robe&quot; (1937). Over the following 15 years, Sjöström returned to acting in the theatre, performed a variety of leading roles in more than a dozen films, and was a company director of Svensk Film Industri. Arguably his noted performance came with his final film role. On the cusp of turning 78, he played the elderly professor Isak Borg in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; (1957).

== Personal life ==
Sjöström was married three times. His daughter was actress Guje Lagerwall (1918–2019).

==Death and legacy==
Victor Sjöström died in Stockholm on 3 January 1960 at the age of 80, and was buried in the Norra begravningsplatsen (Northern cemetery).

A theatre in Filmhuset, home of the Swedish Film Institute, was named in his honour as &quot;Bio Victor&quot;.

<text>Warner Oland (born Johan Verner Ölund; October 3, 1879 – August 6, 1938) was a Swedish-American actor. His career included time on Broadway and numerous film appearances. He is most remembered for playing several Chinese and Chinese-American characters: Dr. Fu Manchu, Henry Chang in &quot;Shanghai Express&quot;, and, most notably, Honolulu Police detective Lieutenant Charlie Chan in 16 films.

==Early years==
Oland was born in the village of Nyby, Bjurholm Municipality, Västerbotten County, Sweden. He claimed that his vaguely Asian appearance was due to possessing some Mongolian ancestry, though his known ancestry contains no indication that this was so. In his native Sweden, one theory (to explain his appearance) is that Oland&#x27;s family was possibly of Sami heritage. According to a 2024 biography, there are plenty of Sami people near Oland&#x27;s place of birth, but that there is not much in Oland&#x27;s family tree that would suggest that they were of Sami heritage.

When he was 13, Oland&#x27;s family immigrated to the United States, in November 1892, on board the S/S &quot;Thingvalla&quot;, which sailed from Christiania, Norway, to New York. After an initial stay in New York City, the family settled in New Britain, Connecticut. Educated in Boston, Oland spoke English and his native Swedish, and eventually translated some of the plays of August Strindberg.

As a young man, Oland pursued a career in theater, at first working on set design while developing his skills as a dramatic actor. In 1906, he was signed to tour the country with the troupe led by Russian-American actress Alla Nazimova (1879–1945). The following year, he met and married the playwright and portrait painter Edith Gardener Shearn (1872-1968). Shearn made an ideal partner for Oland. She mastered Swedish, helping him with the translation of Strindberg&#x27;s works that they jointly published in book form in 1912.

==Film career==

===Career beginnings===
After several years in theater, including appearances on Broadway as Warner Oland, in 1912 he made his silent film debut in &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, a film based on the John Bunyan novel. As a result of his training as a Shakespearean actor and his easy adoption of a sinister look, he was much in demand as a villain and in ethnic roles. Over the next 15 years, he appeared in more than 30 films, including a major role in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927), one of the first talkies produced.

===Becoming a star===

Oland&#x27;s normal appearance fit the Hollywood expectation of caricatured Asianness of the time. He portrayed a variety of Asian characters in several movies before being offered the leading role in the 1929 film &quot;The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu&quot;.

A box office success, &quot;The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; made Oland a star, and during the next two years he portrayed the evil Dr. Fu Manchu in three more films (although the second one was purely a cameo appearance). He was cast as an exotic menace in director Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s 1932 classic film &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; opposite Marlene Dietrich and Anna May Wong. In &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; (1934)
Oland played a werewolf, biting the protagonist, played by Henry Hull. After portraying a Chinese ambassador in the 1935 film &quot;Shanghai&quot;, he abandoned character work and pursued his starring series as Charlie Chan exclusively.

===The Charlie Chan franchise===
In 1931, already familiar from his Oriental roles, he was cast as Charlie Chan in the international detective mystery film &quot;Charlie Chan Carries On&quot;. The enormous worldwide boxoffice success of his Charlie Chan film led to more, with Oland starring in 16 Chan films in total. The series, Jill Lepore later wrote, &quot;kept Fox afloat&quot; during the 1930s, while earning Oland $40,000 per movie. Oland took his role seriously, studying the Chinese language and calligraphy. The scripts almost always called for Oland to comment on the action by offering nuggets of Oriental wisdom: &quot;Hasty deduction like ancient egg. Look good from outside.&quot;

==Final year and death==
Despite his wealth and success, Oland suffered from alcoholism that severely affected his health and his 30-year marriage. In January 1938, he started filming &quot;Charlie Chan at the Ringside&quot;. However, a week into shooting, he began behaving erratically and eventually walked off the set, causing the film to be abandoned. After a spell in the hospital, he signed a new three-picture deal with Fox to continue playing Chan. 

During this period he was involved in a bitter divorce from his wife. He was forbidden, by court order, from traveling overseas or moving his assets abroad. Around this time, he was involved in a public incident when, having ordered his chauffeur to drive him to Mexico, he was observed during a rest stop sitting on the running board of his car throwing his shoes at onlookers. 

The divorce settlement, favouring his wife, was announced to the media on April 2, 1938. The same day he left the United States by steamship, turning up in southern Europe, then proceeding to his native Sweden, where he stayed with an architect friend. In Sweden, Oland contracted bronchial pneumonia, worsened by the apparent onset of emphysema from years of heavy cigarette smoking, and he died in a hospital in Stockholm, on August 6, 1938, aged 58.

Following cremation in Sweden, his ashes were brought back to the United States by his ex-wife, for interment in the Southborough Rural Cemetery in Southborough, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, where the Olands had previously resided in an historic farmhouse.
His last film, the unfinished &quot;Charlie Chan at the Ringside&quot;, was re-shot with Peter Lorre replacing Oland, and released as &quot;Mr. Moto&#x27;s Gamble&quot; (1938). 

In &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, Paramahansa Yogananda describes his encounter with an unnamed famous actor, presumably Oland, while travelling by train. The actor was initially critical of Yogananda&#x27;s Indian garb but their conversation soon evolved into an amicable philosophical discussion.

<text>Advise and Consent is a 1959 political fiction novel by Allen Drury that explores the United States Senate confirmation of controversial Secretary of State nominee Robert Leffingwell, whose promotion is endangered due to growing evidence that the nominee had been a member of the Communist Party. The chief characters&#x27; responses to the evidence, and their efforts to spread or suppress it, form the basis of the novel.

The novel spent 102 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1960 and was adapted into a successful 1962 film starring Henry Fonda. It was followed by Drury&#x27;s &quot;A Shade of Difference&quot; in 1962, and four additional sequels.

==Background==
The novel&#x27;s title comes from the United States Constitution&#x27;s Article II, Sec. 2, cl. 2, which provides that the President of the United States &quot;shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States . . . .&quot;

Drury believed most Americans were naive about the dangers of the Soviet-led communist threat to undermine the government of the United States:

&quot;Advise and Consent&quot; is a fictional account of the nomination of a prominent liberal, Robert Leffingwell, to the cabinet position of Secretary of State during the height of the Cold War. It is said that the story is based on Drury&#x27;s first-hand insight into the personalities and political practices of the late-1950s including the 1954 episode wherein Senators Styles Bridges and Herman Welker threatened to publicize a homosexual in Senator Lester Hunt&#x27;s family if Hunt did not resign from the Senate.

In fact, the website of the U.S. Senate states: 

Several sources agree that character Robert Leffingwell, the novel&#x27;s nominee for Secretary of State, represents Alger Hiss.

Addressing the suggestion that the book was a &quot;roman à clef&quot;, Drury wrote a very sharply worded preface which was only published in the new edition:
== Plot summary ==
The U.S. president decides to replace his Secretary of State to promote rapprochement with the Soviet Union. Nominee Robert Leffingwell, a darling of liberals, is viewed by many conservative senators as an appeaser. Others, including the pivotal character of Senator Seabright (Seab) Cooley of South Carolina, have serious doubts about Leffingwell&#x27;s character. The book tells the story of an up-and-down nomination process that most people fully expect to result in a quick approval of the controversial nominee.

But Cooley is not so easily defeated. He uncovers a minor bureaucrat named Gelman who testifies that twenty years earlier then-University of Chicago instructor Leffingwell invited Gelman to join a small Communist cell that included a fellow traveler who went by the pseudonym James Morton. After outright lies under oath by the nominee and vigorous cross examination by Leffingwell, Gelman is thoroughly discredited and deemed an unfit witness by the subcommittee and its charismatic chairman Utah Senator Brig Anderson. The subcommittee is ready to approve the nominee.

At this crucial moment in the story, the tenacious Senator Cooley dissects Gelman&#x27;s testimony and discovers a way to identify James Morton. Cooley maneuvers Morton into confessing the truth of Gelman&#x27;s assertions to Senator Anderson who subsequently re-opens the subcommittee&#x27;s hearings, thus enraging the President. When the President&#x27;s attempts to buy Anderson&#x27;s cooperation fail he places enormous pressure on Majority Leader Robert Munson to entice Anderson into compliance. In a moment of great weakness that Munson will regret the rest of his life, Munson provides the President a photograph, acquired quite innocently by Munson, that betrays Anderson&#x27;s brief wartime homosexual liaison.

Armed with the blackmail instrument he needs, the president ignores Anderson&#x27;s proof of Leffingwell&#x27;s treachery and plots to use the photo to gain Anderson&#x27;s silence. The president plants the photo with leftist Senator Fred Van Ackerman, thinking he will never need to use it. But the President has underestimated Van Ackerman&#x27;s treachery and misjudged Anderson&#x27;s reaction should the truth come out. After a series of circumstances involving Anderson&#x27;s secret being revealed to his wife, the Washington press corps, and several senators, Anderson kills himself. Anderson&#x27;s death turns the majority of the Senate against the president and the majority leader. Anderson&#x27;s suicide and the exposure of the truth about Leffingwell&#x27;s lies regarding his communist past set in motion a chain reaction that ends several careers and ultimately rejects Leffingwell as a nominee to become Secretary of State.

The final one hundred pages of the book contain several &quot;teases&quot; by the author making it clear there is a sequel to come (Drury wrote five more books in his series), but &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; effectively ends with the overwhelming vote to reject Leffingwell. The segue to the next book in the series is the death of the president (heart attack) and the elevation of Vice President Harley Hudson.

==Reception==
&quot;Saturday Review&quot; said of &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; in August 1959 that &quot;It may be a long time before a better one comes along.&quot; Roger Kaplan of &quot;Policy Review&quot; wrote in 1999 that the novel &quot;in many ways invented a genre in fiction…. The use of a racy intrigue, if possible involving both sex and foreign policy, is what characterizes the contemporary form. Forty years on, &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; is the only book of this genre that a literary-minded person really ought to read.&quot; Richard L. Neuberger reviewed the novel for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1959, writing that &quot;rarely has a political tale been told with such vivid realism&quot; and calling the book &quot;one of the finest and most gripping political novels of our era.&quot; Conversely, Pamela Hansford Johnson of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; called &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; &quot;politically repellent and artistically null with a steady hysterical undertone.&quot;

The novel spent 102 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. In 1960, the Pulitzer Prize committee recommended that the award for fiction be given to Saul Bellow&#x27;s &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot;, but the board overrode that recommendation and awarded it to &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;.

In 2009, Scott Simon wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Fifty years after its publication and astounding success ... Allen Drury&#x27;s novel remains the definitive Washington tale.&quot; He wrote of Drury that &quot;the conservative Washington novelist was more progressive than Hollywood liberals,&quot; noting that the character of Brigham Anderson, the young senator hiding a secret wartime homosexual tryst, is &quot;candid and unapologetic&quot; about his affair, and even calling him &quot;Drury&#x27;s most appealing character&quot;. Assessing Drury&#x27;s body of work in 1999, Erik Tarloff suggested in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;homosexuality does appear to be the only minority status to which Drury seems inclined to accord much sympathy.&quot; Frank Rich wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2005:
Writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2014, Jonathan Karl called &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; &quot;the last great novel set in Washington&quot;. He called the characters &quot;complicated and multi-dimensional, with principled convictions and plausible personal weaknesses.&quot;

&quot;Advise and Consent&quot; had been out of print for almost 15 years and ranked #27 on the 2013 BookFinder.com list of the Top 100 Most Searched for Out of Print Books before WordFire Press reissued it in paperback and e-book format in February 2014. The WordFire edition includes never-before-published essays about the book written by Drury himself, new appendices, and remembrances by Drury&#x27;s heirs and literary executors Kenneth and Kevin Killiany. WordFire also released &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; five sequels.

==Adaptations==
Drury&#x27;s novel was adapted by Loring Mandel into the 1960 Broadway play &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;, directed by Franklin Schaffner and starring Richard Kiley, Ed Begley, Henry Jones and Chester Morris. The play ran successfully on Broadway at the Cort Theatre from November 17, 1960, to May 20, 1961. The production was followed by a national company, starring Farley Granger.

The novel was also adapted into the 1962 film &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot;, directed by Otto Preminger and starring Walter Pidgeon and Henry Fonda. Preminger was nominated for a at the Cannes Film Festival, and Burgess Meredith won the National Board of Review award for Best Supporting Actor for his role. Charles Laughton was also nominated for a British Academy Film Award for Best Foreign Actor. LGBT film historian Vito Russo noted that &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; contained the first official portrayal of a gay bar in film.

<text>The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club, also known as the South Sydney Rabbitohs, is an Australian professional rugby league football club based in the Sydney suburb of Redfern that competes in the National Rugby League (NRL). They are often nicknamed &quot;Souths&quot; or &quot;the&quot; &quot;Bunnies&quot;.

The club was formed in 1908, as one of the founding members of the New South Wales Rugby Football League, making it one of Australia&#x27;s oldest rugby league teams. It is one of only two NSW foundation clubs still present in the NRL, the other being the Sydney Roosters.

South Sydney&#x27;s traditional heartland covers the once typically working-class suburbs of inner-south Sydney. The club is based in Redfern, where its administration and training facilities are located, however it has long held a wide supporter base spread all over New South Wales. The team&#x27;s home ground is currently Stadium Australia in Sydney Olympic Park. South Sydney is the most successful professional team in the history of Australian rugby league with twenty-one first grade premierships.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was formed at a meeting on 17 January 1908 at Redfern Town Hall when administrator J. J. Giltinan, cricketer Victor Trumper and politician Henry Hoyle gathered together in front of a large crowd of supporters. The club played in the first round of the newly formed New South Wales Rugby League, defeating North Sydney 11–7 at Birchgrove Oval on 20 April 1908. The team went on to win the inaugural premiership then successfully defended its title in the 1909 season, winning the Grand Final by default. During these early years Arthur Hennessy was considered the &quot;founding father&quot; of the South Sydney rugby league club. A hooker and prop forward, Hennessy was Souths&#x27; first captain and coach. He was also New South Wales&#x27; first captain and Australia&#x27;s first test captain in 1908. S. G. &quot;George&quot; Ball became Club Secretary in 1911 after Arthur Hennessy stood down from the position, and he remained in that capacity for over 50 years, only retiring a few years before his death in 1969.

=== NSWRFL &amp; ARL (1908–1997) ===
After further premiership success in 1914 and 1918, South Sydney won seven of the eight premierships from 1925 to 1932, missing out only in 1930. The 1925 side went through the season undefeated for 12 games. and is only one of six Australian premiership sides in history to have achieved this feat. Such was Souths&#x27; dominance in the early years of the rugby league competition that the Rabbitohs were labelled &quot;The Pride of the League&quot;.

South Sydney struggled between 1940–1948. South Sydney&#x27;s longest losing streak of 22 games was during the period 1945–1947. In the 1945 season the club only managed to win one game while in 1946 it was unable to win a single game.

==== 1950s golden era (1949–1957) ====
1949 would mark the beginning of almost a decade of great success for South Sydney, winning five of the six premierships from 1950 to 1955, and losing the 1949 Grand Final against St. George, and also the 1952 Grand Final against Western Suburbs in controversial circumstances. The 1951 side&#x27;s point scoring feat in its 42–14 victory over Manly-Warringah remains the highest score by a team in a Grand Final and &quot;the miracle of &#x27;55&quot; involved South Sydney winning 11 straight sudden death matches to win the premiership. Players that were involved in these years included Denis Donoghue, Jack Rayner, Les &quot;Chicka&quot; Cowie, Johnny Graves, Ian Moir, Greg Hawick, Ernie Hammerton, Bernie Purcell and Clive Churchill. Churchill, nicknamed &quot;the Little Master&quot; for his brilliant attacking fullback play, is universally regarded as one of the greatest ever Australian rugby league players.

In the late 1950s Souths began a run of poor form, failing to make the finals from 1958 to 1964, during this time receiving the 1962 wooden spoon.

==== More premiership success (1965–1971) ====
In 1965 a talented young side made the Grand Final against St. George who were aiming to secure its tenth straight premiership. The young Rabbitohs were not overawed by the Dragons&#x27; formidable experience and in front of a record crowd of 78,056 at the Sydney Cricket Ground, it went down narrowly 12–8. The nucleus of this side went on to feature in Australian representative teams for the next six years and ensured another golden period for South Sydney making five successive grand finals from 1967 to 1971, winning four. Bob McCarthy, John O&#x27;Neill, Eric Simms, Ron Coote, Mike Cleary and John Sattler from 1965 were later joined by Elwyn Walters, Ray Branighan, Paul Sait, Gary Stevens and coach Clive Churchill to form a fearsome combination before internal strife and poaching by other clubs from 1972 onwards unravelled the star studded pack. From this period comes part of South&#x27;s and Australian Rugby League folklore when in the 1970 premiership decider against Manly, captain John Sattler inspired the side to victory playing out 70 minutes of the match with his jaw broken in three places after being king hit by Manly prop John Bucknall.

==== Financial trouble and exclusion (1972–1999) ====
Financial problems started to hit Souths in the early 1970s, forcing some players to go to other clubs. The licensed Leagues Club, traditionally such an important revenue provider to all first grade league sides, was closed in 1973 but a &quot;Save Our Souths&quot; campaign ensured the club survived. &quot;Super Coach&quot; Jack Gibson&#x27;s arrival turned the club&#x27;s form, winning the pre-season competition in 1978. The club captured victories in the mid-week Tooth Cup competition in 1981 and in the pre-season &quot;Sevens&quot; competition in 1988. The Rabbitohs made the finals on five occasions in the 1980s, including a dominant season to finish as minor premiers in 1989. The 1989 season proved to be the club&#x27;s most successful in years, but was also the last time the club reached the finals until 2007. The following season the Rabbitohs finished as wooden spooners.

The club stayed afloat in the 1990s despite major financial problems. Souths&#x27; only success came in 1994 when it won the pre-season competition, defeating the Brisbane Broncos 27–26 in the final. The Super League War and the eventual formation of the National Rugby League affected the club greatly when it was determined in 1998 that the newly formed competition would be contracted to 14 teams for the 2000 season. Following a series of mergers by other teams, and a planned merger with Cronulla-Sutherland that was met with staunch opposition from both clubs, South Sydney failed to meet the National Rugby League&#x27;s selection criteria to compete in the competition and were subsequently excluded from the premiership at the end of the 1999 season.

==== Fight for readmission ====

In 2000 and 2001, South Sydney fought its way back into the competition following a string of high-profile legal battles against the National Rugby League and News Limited. A number of well attended public rallies took place during this time, as supporters from many different clubs got behind South Sydney&#x27;s case. Upon appeal to the Federal Court in 2001, South Sydney won readmission into the premiership for the 2002 season.

=== National Rugby League (2002–present) ===
After being readmitted, South Sydney were initially unsuccessful in the premiership, finishing amongst the bottom three teams for five seasons straight including three wooden spoons. Following this, the club was taken over by actor Russell Crowe and businessman Peter Holmes à Court in 2006. In the 2007 season South Sydney played in its first finals campaign since 1989.
May 2008 saw the sudden resignation of the then current executive chairman and CEO, Peter Holmes à Court. He had been appointed to the role of CEO at the start of 2008. Reports suggested that Holmes à Court had been forced to stand down after his relationship with Russell Crowe had deteriorated beyond repair.
The South Sydney Rabbitohs celebrated its centenary year during the 2008 National Rugby League season. That year the club were named the National Trust&#x27;s inaugural &#x27;Community Icon&#x27;, in recognition of the club&#x27;s significant longstanding contribution to sport and sporting culture at both state and national levels.

==== Return to premiership success ====
The arrival of Sam Burgess and Greg Inglis to the club in the early 2010s saw South Sydney qualify for the finals. In April 2011, Souths announced Michael Maguire would replace retiring coach John Lang for the 2012 season, signing as head coach on a three-year deal.
Following consecutive preliminary final exits in 2012 and 2013, it defeated the Sydney Roosters in the 2014 preliminary final to advance to its first grand final since the successful 1971 campaign.

Following a slim 6–0 lead in the first half of the 2014 grand final, Souths scored four second half tries to defeat Canterbury 30–6. This was South Sydney&#x27;s first premiership win in 43 years. Sam Burgess received the Clive Churchill medal despite playing the entire match with a fractured cheekbone, suffered from a head clash during the first tackle of the match.

Following the premiership victory, South Sydney were presented with the Keys to the City of Randwick by Mayor Ted Seng at a presentation ceremony at Souths Juniors in Kingsford and later the same day awarded the Keys to the City of Sydney by Lord Mayor Clover Moore at a reception at Sydney Town Hall.

On 23 October 2014, Holmes à Court sold his 50% share of Blackcourt League Investments, and consequently his 37.5% stake in South Sydney, to James Packer&#x27;s Consolidated Press Holdings.

After elimination early in the 2015 finals series, a nine-game winning streak in 2018 saw South Sydney return to premiership contention. This season marked the start of five consecutive preliminary finals appearances in the late 2010s and early 2020s. After losses in consecutive years to the Sydney Roosters, Canberra, and Penrith, Souths defeated Manly in 2021 to advance to the grand final against Penrith.

With the game poised at 8–8 in the second half, Cody Walker threw a pass that was intercepted by Panthers winger Stephen Crichton who scored untouched. Souths scored in the final five minutes of the match, but halfback Adam Reynolds missed the conversion from the sideline and a subsequent field-goal attempt, either of which would have seen the game tied. Penrith won the game 14–12. Penrith would also defeat South Sydney in the 2022 preliminary final, ending Souths&#x27; season for the third year in a row.

Prior to the 2022 season, Atlassian founder Mike Cannon-Brookes became a partial owner of the Rabbitohs by buying one third of the management firm alongside Crowe and Packer. Together, these three own 75% of the Rabbitohs; the remaining 25% of the club is owned by fans.
Despite sitting 2nd at the midway point of 2023, Souths only won four of their remaining thirteen fixtures to miss the finals series.
South Sydney started the 2024 NRL season poorly winning only one game from their opening seven matches. On 30 April 2024, head coach Jason Demetriou was sacked by the club with Ben Hornby replacing him as interim head coach. South Sydney would finish the 2024 NRL season in 16th place on the table managing only eight wins all year.

==Club symbols==

=== Emblem ===
The club mascot is the &quot;rabbitoh&quot;, a now-disused term that was commonly used in the early 20th century to describe hawkers who captured and skinned rabbits and then sold the meat at markets, so named because they would shout &quot;rabbit-oh!&quot; around the markets and suburbs to attract buyers. The club is also informally referred to as the &quot;Rabbits&quot;, &quot;Bunnies&quot; or &quot;Souths&quot;.

Exactly how South Sydney came to be known as the Rabbitohs is unknown. According to one version of events, dating from pre-schism days at the turn of the 20th century, some of the club&#x27;s players earned some extra money on Saturday mornings as rabbit-oh men, staining their jerseys with rabbit blood in the process; when they played in those blood stained jumpers that afternoon, opponents from wealthier rugby clubs did not always appreciate the aroma and would mockingly repeat the &quot;Rabbitoh!&quot; cry. Another version was that the term was a disparaging reference by opposing teams to South&#x27;s home ground being plagued with &quot;rabbit &#x27;oles&quot;; in those early days Redfern Oval was then known as Nathan&#x27;s Cow Paddock. A third version claims the Rabbitoh name was adopted from that of the touring Australian rugby union teams of the early 1900s who were nicknamed &quot;Rabbits&quot; prior to discarding the name in 1908 in favour of the moniker &quot;Wallabies&quot;.

The &quot;Rabbitoh&quot; emblem, a running white rabbit, first appeared on the team&#x27;s jersey in 1959. The Rabbitoh emblem has in various forms been carried as the club&#x27;s crest on every player&#x27;s jersey ever since. The original &quot;Rabbitoh&quot; emblem design that appeared on the team&#x27;s jerseys throughout the 1960s and 1970s has now been incorporated on the current jersey.

The South Sydney Rabbitohs celebrated its centenary year during 2008. The club released a centenary emblem to commemorate the occasion. To also coincide with the centenary year, Souths opted to alter the logo by removing the red and green oval from the emblem for a solid white rabbit with the words &quot;South Sydney Rabbitohs&quot; set in uppercase type.

=== Colours ===
South Sydney has used cardinal red and myrtle green colours on its playing jerseys for the vast majority of the club&#x27;s history. Prior to the establishment of the rugby league club in 1908, the South Sydney rugby union team originally wore a red and green hooped jersey. Some sources have suggested that this combination of colours was due to the local rugby union club being nicknamed the &quot;Redfern Waratahs&quot;. The first British inhabitants had often called the waratah a &quot;red fern&quot; instead, hence giving the suburb its name, and ultimately the local rugby club its emblem. Red and green dominate the colours of the waratah and hence, possibly, the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club adopted these colours for its jerseys. However, the suburb of Redfern was named in honour of William Redfern, one of the first doctors of the colony, who treated convicts and poor settlers as well as the wealthy.

The club&#x27;s jersey has been a hooped-styled one comprising alternating red and green, and has been used for the vast majority of the club&#x27;s history. In 1945 and 1946 the club broke with this tradition and used a green design with a red &quot;V&quot; around the collar, before reverting to the original hoop style. From 1980 to 1984 the team played in a strip which saw the inclusion of white hoops within a predominately green design with a central red stripe and was affectionately known as the &quot;Minties&quot; jersey (so-called due to its apparent similarity to the wrapper design of the popular sweet). With the introduction of &quot;away&quot; jerseys towards the end of the 20th century, the club initially introduced a predominantly white jersey for away matches which was changed to a predominantly black one for the 2006 season.

Before the start of the 2007 season, the club announced that the away jersey would be styled identically to the traditional home jersey, with the exception of sponsorship and the rabbit emblem, which has been styled similarly to the one that initially featured on jerseys in the 1960s. For season 2009, the rabbit emblem is black for home matches whilst the emblem is the original white for away matches.

The playing shorts worn were historically black, though in the late 1970s the club adopted green shorts with a red vertical stripe. This was then superseded by the white shorts of the &quot;Minties&quot; outfit. When the club subsequently reverted to the traditional playing strip, the decision was made to wear black shorts once more. In 2008 the Rabbitohs wore white shorts to match the white stripe running down the side of the jersey.

==Geographic area==
The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club (precursor to the current corporate entity) was formed, under the original 1908 articles of association with the NSWRL competition, to represent the Sydney municipalities of Alexandria, Botany, Mascot, Waterloo, Redfern and Darlington and the southern parts of the City of Sydney. It additionally represents southern parts of the eastern suburbs of Sydney, including the suburbs Coogee, Kensington, Kingsford, and Maroubra.

Souths have a proud history of Indigenous players from the local district clubs including La Perouse United, Redfern All Blacks and Indigenous recruits from Country NSW.

==Stadium==
During the early years of the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, &quot;home games&quot; were not assigned very often. However, South Sydney played most of its games at the Royal Agricultural Society Ground (Sydney Showground) from 1908 until the club&#x27;s departure in 1920. From 1911 onwards, the Sydney Sports Ground was also used interchangeably with the Agricultural Ground over a decade for hosting matches. In 1947 the club played its final season at the Sports Ground, before relocating to Redfern Oval in 1948. It was here that team played in the heart of the club&#x27;s territory and played the vast majority of its allocated home matches.
In 1988, the club began to play in the Sydney Football Stadium, just built upon the former Sydney Sports Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 Oval. The side continued to play here up until 2005, with the exception of 2000 and 2001 when South Sydney was absent from the premiership. During 2004–2005, when the Rabbitoh&#x27;s contract with Sydney Football Stadium was about to expire, new home grounds were investigated at Gosford, North Sydney Oval and Stadium Australia. Eventually the decision was made to relocate to Stadium Australia at Sydney Olympic Park. The move was generally not well received by the fans, but provided considerably more income for the club, which was several million dollars in the red at the end of 2005. In 2008, the club renewed its partnership with Stadium Australia to play NRL home games and home finals at the venue for the next 10 years.

During 2008, the City of Sydney Council completed a $19.5 million upgrade and renovation of Redfern Oval. From season 2009, the upgraded Redfern Oval provided the Rabbitohs with training facilities and a venue for hosting pre-season and exhibition matches.

In 2023, the Rabbitohs relocated its headquarters and first team training facilities from Redfern Oval to the Heffron Centre, a $58M community sporting complex in Maroubra owned by Randwick City Council. The South Sydney Rabbitohs’ $26M Community and High Performance Centre provides training facilities for the NRL, Women’s and NSW Cup teams, as well as facilities for the administrative, commercial and Souths Cares staff members.

==Supporters==
The South Sydney Rabbitohs continue to have a large supporter base in its traditional areas of South-eastern Sydney, despite having moved from Redfern Oval two decades ago, while also enjoying wide support throughout other rugby league playing centres around the country. The official South Sydney supporter group is known as &quot;The Burrow&quot;.

South Sydney at one stage had the highest football club membership in the National Rugby League, with membership exceeding 35,000 as of June 23, 2015. That member number also included more than 11,000 ticketed members, the highest of the Sydney-based NRL clubs. Following the conclusion of the 2021 NRL season, new figures showed South Sydney to have the second highest membership of Sydney NRL clubs behind Parramatta.

It was announced during the 2010 Charity Shield game that both St. George Illawarra and Souths had exceeded the 10,000 milestone, making the 2010 season the first time two Sydney clubs had entered the season with 10,000 ticketed members each. The club had members from every state in Australia and international members in 22 countries. Football club membership peaked at some 22,000 when the club was re-admitted to the National Rugby League for season 2002.

&quot;Group 14&quot;, a collection of club backers including businessmen, politicians, musicians and media personalities, was formed before the Rabbitohs&#x27; exclusion from the NRL in 1999. Members include Anthony Albanese, Laurie Brereton, Michael Cheika, Rodger Corser, Michael Daley, Andrew Denton, Cathy Freeman, Nick Greiner, Deirdre Grusovin, Ron Hoenig, Ray Martin, Mikey Robins, and Mike Whitney. They contributed to South Sydney&#x27;s bid for reinstatement, following the club&#x27;s exclusion from the competition at the end of the 1999 season. A sustained campaign of public support that year, unprecedented in Australian sporting history, saw 40,000 people attend a rally in the Sydney CBD in support of South Sydney&#x27;s cause. In 2000 and 2001, public street marches took place in Sydney with in excess of 80,000 people rallying behind the Rabbitohs. The club also has a number of high-profile supporters as well, many of whom were dominant figures in Souths&#x27; battle to be readmitted into the premiership in 2000 and 2001. In 2007, supporters set a new club record for attendance with an average home crowd figure of 15,702 being the highest ever since the introduction of the home and away system in 1974.

In 2023, 31st Prime Minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, a lifelong South Sydney supporter, was named the club’s number one ticket-holder.

=== Reggie the Rabbit ===
Reggie the Rabbit is the Rabbitohs&#x27; mascot. The mascot first appeared in lifesize form in 1968 after celebrity fan Don Lane brought back a suit from the US in time for the 1968 grand final against Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, won by the Rabbitohs 13–9. Perhaps the most notable of the early Reggies was the club&#x27;s groundsman Reg Fridd. Standing just over four feet tall, the Rabbitohs lured the diminutive New Zealander from a touring production of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot;, the same troupe that had yielded the second Reggie, Roscoe Bova, killed in a car accident in the early 1970s. Most teams in the National Rugby League maintain mascots. During 2000 and 2001, when Souths was excluded from the NRL, Anth Courtney was Reggie Rabbit appearing at the second Town Hall rally and at games at Redfern Oval as well as being active in travelling extensively around the state to attend fundraisers as Reggie Rabbit.

Charlie Gallico has been South Sydney&#x27;s Reggie Rabbit since 2002,

==South Sydney Leagues Club==
===The Juniors===
The Juniors aka Souths Juniors on Anzac Parade in Kingsford, New South Wales has been the club&#x27;s leagues club since the old Souths Leagues closed in 2013. The club is owned by the South Sydney District Junior Rugby Football League.

====Juniors at the Junction====
Juniors @ The Junction (Since 2009) – The result of a merger with South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club (Kingsford) and the struggling Maroubra Returned and Services League (RSL) Club. The club is on the site of the former Maroubra RSL club on Anzac Parade and Haig Street.

====The Juniors on Hawkesbury====
The Juniors on Hawkesbury (Since 2008) – in the Hawkesbury River

===South Sydney Leagues Club===
The South Sydney Leagues Club, colloquially known as Souths Leagues, was the club&#x27;s official leagues club. The club closed in 2013 after being placed into administration with large debts.

==Culture and tradition==
In 1999 Russell Crowe bought the foundation bell at the Red and Green Ball for the club.

=== Team songs ===

==== Glory, Glory to South Sydney ====
The club&#x27;s most well known song is played when the team runs out for home games and after victories at home. Originally recorded in 1967 by the Will Dower Sounds as &quot;South&#x27;s Victory Song&quot; [sic], &quot;Glory, Glory to South Sydney&quot; is one of the best-known NRL team songs, prominently featuring in promotional materials, merchandise and even the #GGTSS hashtag.

The original version was written when there were 10 clubs in the NSWRFL premiership, and predates the admission of Penrith and Cronulla-Sutherland for the 1967 season, despite its release date.

The song is likely to have been inspired by Glory Glory (football chant), sharing Battle Hymn of the Republic&#x27;s tune and coincided with the club&#x27;s most recent &quot;golden era&quot;. While the NSWRFL premiership had been won for 11 consecutive seasons by the St. George Dragons, the Rabbitohs had a strong team and won the 1967 NSWRFL premiership, going back-to-back in 1968 and winning all but one Grand Final between then and 1971.

The song was heavily played and featured in the club&#x27;s &quot;fightback&quot; effort when Souths were excluded from the 14-team NRL seasons in 2000 and 2001. In 2004, Allan Caswell wrote an updated and modernised version, referencing the 15 teams in the NRL Telstra Premiership at the time, which was played at home games for several years before being replaced by the original.

Somewhat controversially, whilst sponsored by Real Insurance in 2005 and 2006, the club made its entrance to a version of The Real Thing as a tie-in. Upon the expiration of the deal, the club reverted to &quot;Glory Glory&quot;, but this time a modernised pop version incorporating only the chorus and &quot;South Sydney&quot; chant sung by a female vocalist.

As of 2023, the original 1967 version is used officially by the club and featured at the club&#x27;s 2014 and 2021 Grand Final appearances.
==== Victory song ====
The Rabbitohs&#x27; victory song (also known as the &quot;player&#x27;s song&quot;) appears to be of pre-WWII origin, but awareness has grown over the years and especially around the passing of club legend John Sattler, whose performances of the song around the club&#x27;s 2014 and 2021 NRL Grand Final in various media have become somewhat iconic within the South Sydney community and were played after the club&#x27;s win the week after his passing.

The lyrics have varied over the year in a form of Oral tradition - the current version sung by the players after a win only features the first verse/stanza, preceded recently (in 2023) by a player or special guest calling out &quot;If You&#x27;re Happy and You Know It&quot;, responded en masse with claps.

The tune of the song differs by segment - the main part as still sung, according to John Sattler&#x27;s version, is based on the melody of The Stars and Stripes Forever.

==== Botany Road ====
The Burrow (supporters&#x27; group) began singing a chant to the tune of Take Me Home, Country Roads during the club&#x27;s resurgence in the 2010s, generally reserving this chant for when victory was assured within 5 minutes of full time.

Flags, banners and scarves bearing Botany Road are found throughout South Sydney&#x27;s supporters at games, referencing the eponymous road that runs through the heart of the South Sydney geographical area.

The song is now an iconic part of the Rabbitohs fan experience, especially during rivalry and Finals Series games. The early repetitions are normally sung at a slow and deliberate pace &quot;a capella&quot;, with the pace increasing closer to full time and supporters clapping along as the time runs down.
==== Other club songs ====

===== The Burrow chants =====
The Burrow have numerous Football chants, both in support of the club and its players as well as against rivals. Some of the most prominent songs and chants, as found in their songbooks, include &quot;South Sydney &#x27;Til I Die&quot;, &quot;Rabbitohs&quot;, the aforementioned &quot;Botany Road&quot; and several player-based songs, including a version of Whole Again in appreciation of Damien Cook.

The Burrow also gather in their bay to sing their own version of Under the Southern Cross I Stand after Rabbitohs victories, adapted from the Australian national cricket team.

===== Fightback-era songs =====
During the club&#x27;s exile, numerous supporters of the club contributed songs to raise awareness of their plight and to serve as a fundraiser through the sale of &quot;The Glory of South Sydney&quot; CD and VHS.

Allan Caswell and Mark Egan penned &quot;Souths Can Stand Alone&quot;, which was performed at several fundraisers and protests. The song claims &quot;if they dump South Sydney, they&#x27;re dumping Rugby League&quot; and thanks George Piggins for his efforts. A music video featuring a montage of South Sydney moments and heroes was included on the VHS version.

Caswell himself became a prominent figure in the campaign, creating several satirical or parody versions of well-known songs, including the club&#x27;s own &quot;Glory Glory&quot;, in protest of News Corp Australia and the National Rugby League&#x27;s decision to exclude South Sydney from the 2000 and future seasons.

Other contributions included &quot;Glory in their Eyes&quot;, a song by John Maclean that touches on the long period since Souths&#x27; last premiership and the struggle of long-time Souths supporters having to accept the loss of their club, &quot;Rabbitohs&quot; by Daniel Lissing which concludes with the line &quot;South Sydney marches on&quot; in defiance of the club&#x27;s exclusion, as well as &quot;Calling All Rabbits&quot; which was constructed from commentary and news soundbytes relating to famous moments on-field, the fight to remain in and return to NRL competition and the like.

===== Other songs =====
One of the more famous South Sydney inspired songs in recent years is &quot;The Day John Sattler Broke His Jaw&quot; by Perry Keyes and later covered by The Whitlams and the Black Stump Band, referencing not only the famous heroics of John Sattler in the 1970 Grand Final, but also life in 1970s Australia and inner-city Sydney. The song&#x27;s chorus incorporates Frank Hyde&#x27;s famous &quot;if it&#x27;s high enough, if it&#x27;s long enough, it&#x27;s straight between the posts&quot; commentary.

A Rabbitohs fan covered Eddie Vedder&#x27;s song All the Way, adapting the original&#x27;s references to the Chicago Cubs&#x27; century-long struggle to win its next World Series to South Sydney&#x27;s exclusion and long premiership drought, and the ending of that drought in 2014. The Cubs would win its first World Series since 1908 (also the year Souths participated and won in the inaugural NSWRFL competition) in 2016.

Several supporters have written songs of their own, occasionally garnering some interest within the community.

Pre-game, Souths often have a hype package put together as well as team lineups presented to music. Previous choices for these have included Cochise, Kryptonite and Hail to the King, often interpolated with the &quot;South Sydney&quot; chant just prior to the entrance of the players.

==Kit sponsors and manufacturers==
==Rivalries==
A book, &quot;The Book of Feuds&quot;, chronicling the rivalries of the Rabbitohs with its NRL competitors was written by Mark Courtney at the instigation of Russell Crowe. It has been used as a motivational tool before Souths matches and was later released on sale to the public.

=== Main ===
 Sydney Roosters – South Sydney and its fans have built up rivalries with other clubs, particularly the Sydney Roosters (Eastern Suburbs), the only other remaining foundation club. While South Sydney were historically strongly working class, the Roosters were viewed by South’s supporters as ‘Silvertails’ - supported by upper class folk from Sydney’s Eastern suburbs.

South Sydney and the Roosters share inner-Sydney territory, resulting in a strong rivalry since 1908 when Souths beat Eastern Suburbs in the first grand final 14–12. Games between the neighbouring foundation clubs have since formed part of the oldest &quot;local derby&quot; in the competition. 

The rivalry increased further after 1950 due to conflict between junior territories and since the 1970s escalated once more as both clubs drew key players away from each other (Souths lost internationals Ron Coote, Elwyn Walters and Jim Morgan to Eastern Suburbs from its last era of premiership winning teams, whilst more recently Souths lured key forwards Bryan Fletcher, Peter Cusack and centre Shannon Hegarty away from the Roosters 2002 premiership winning side) and later Michael Crocker. Other players to run out for both clubs include Ashley Harrison, Luke Keary, Angus Crichton, Daniel Suluka-Fifita and Latrell Mitchell. In round 1, 2010, South Sydney and Roosters became the first clubs to play 200 matches against each other. The Sydney Roosters 36–10 victory put the ledger at 105 games won by South Sydney, 90 by the Roosters (Eastern Suburbs) and 5 drawn. 

In 2014, Souths defeated the Sydney Roosters in the preliminary final to reach its first grand final in 43 years. In 2018, the Sydney Roosters defeated Souths 12–4 in the preliminary final at Allianz Stadium which was the last game to be played at the venue. The crowd of 44,380 was also a ground record. In 2019, the two clubs met in the qualifying final which was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. South Sydney had beaten the Sydney Roosters only a week prior in the final game of the regular season but in the qualifying final, the Sydney Roosters won the match 30–6 in a dominant display.

In 2020, the Sydney Roosters managed to record a victory over South Sydney 28–12 in round 3. In the final round of the 2020 NRL season, Souths defeated the Sydney Roosters 60–8. This was the biggest win South Sydney had ever recorded over its rivals eclipsing the previous score set in 1952 when Souths defeated Eastern Suburbs 52–0.

In 2022, South Sydney had declared the club wanted to leave Stadium Australia and make the new Sydney Football Stadium as their home ground. Roosters CEO Nick Politis said to Fox Sports “I’ve heard other people say they want to play there because it’s their home, The point is we’ve been there since 1928. We started with the old sports ground and then 30 years with the old [Sydney Football] Stadium, Nobody else has played there. For another club to say we want to go there because it’s our home, it’s not their home. The Roosters are the only people that belong there. It’s our true home and it’s very sacred&quot;. Despite Politis&#x27; claims, the South Sydney club had used the Sydney Sports Ground as a home ground before Eastern Suburbs and the two clubs often ground shared for the first 30 years of its existence at the venue.

In the 2022 elimination final between the South Sydney and the Sydney Roosters, seven players were sin binned, setting a record for the most in an NRL-era game.

In the last round of the 2023 NRL season, the Sydney Roosters defeated South Sydney 26–12 to end their season and deny them a finals spot. Before the match started both sides knew whoever lost the game would miss out on the finals.

In round 3 of the 2024 NRL season, the Sydney Roosters recorded their second biggest win over South Sydney since 1908 beating them 48-6.

To celebrate the rivalry, South Sydney and the Sydney Roosters play for the Ron Coote Cup annually.

===Major===

 St George Dragons and St George Illawarra Dragons – The long-standing rivalry against St. George results in the annual Charity Shield match, originally played against the original St. George Dragons and now (since the joint venture formed with Illawarra Steelers) played against the current team, St. George Illawarra.

South Sydney and St. George have met several times in grand finals prior to the joint-venture and being the north-eastern neighbours of St. George, had many fierce encounters. In 2001, South Sydney chairman and club legend George Piggins said there would be no chance of the Charity Shield being revived if Souths were to be included back into the NRL saying &quot;The Dragons: They sold us out&quot;. This was in reference to St. George signing an affidavit at the time which included that it would be detrimental if Souths were returned to the competition.

 Balmain Tigers – From 1908–1999, South Sydney had a fierce rivalry with Balmain. The rivalry with Balmain began in 1909 when both teams agreed to boycott the final which was being held as curtain raiser to a Kangaroos v Wallabies match. As agreed, Balmain did not turn up. However, Souths did turn up and were officially awarded the Premiership when it kicked off to an empty half of the field.

South Sydney would later meet Balmain in the 1916 premiership final which Balmain won 5–3. In 1924, Balmain and Souths met in the grand final which is also the lowest scoring grand final in NSWRL/NRL History. Balmain ran out 3-0 winners with the match only seeing one try.
In 1939, Balmain and Souths met once more in the grand final with Balmain winning 33–4. In the 1969 NSWRFL season enmity was again fueled between the clubs with Balmain&#x27;s controversial victory against South Sydney in the grand final that year.

=== Minor ===
 Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles – South Sydney first met Manly-Warringah in the 1951 NSWRFL season&#x27;s Grand Final. South Sydney would win the match 42-14 which as of 2022 is the highest scoring grand final in NSWRL/NRL history. Souths would then meet in the 1968 and 1970 grand finals which South Sydney both won. 

Manly have, since 1970, purchased many of Souths&#x27; star players including John O&#x27;Neill, Ray Branighan, Ian Roberts, and more recently Dylan Walker.

 Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs – A more recent feud that primarily developed in the years 2014 and 2015, following the 2014 NRL Grand Final and a controversial Good Friday match. Canterbury were also Grand Finalists in 1967 with South Sydney prevailing 12−10. Annually, South Sydney and Canterbury-Bankstown compete in the Good Friday game, competing for the Good Friday Cup.

==== Dream Team (2004) ====
The Rabbitohs announced the South Sydney Dream Team at a gala dinner held on 29 July 2004, at the Westin Hotel in Sydney. 17 players were selected in position as well as a coach to represent the South Sydney Football Club from 1908 through to 2004. The team was selected by a group of rugby league experts, historians and by Rabbitohs fans through a public vote.

== Statistics and records ==
South Sydney are the most successful club in terms of honours and individual player achievements in the history of NSW rugby league.

The club achievements include:
* The Rabbitohs have won the most first grade premierships (21) during the history of elite rugby league competition in Australia, in addition to the most reserve grade premierships (21).
* The club has the distinction of being the only team to win a premiership in its inaugural season (1908).
* The club also has the distinction of scoring the most points (42), most tries (8) and most goals (9) in a grand final, all achieved against Manly in 1951.
* South Sydney&#x27;s 1925 first grade side is one of six New South Wales sides to ever go through a season undefeated. The club won the premiership in all three grades in 1925, a feat only repeated on three other occasions (Balmain Tigers in 1915 and 1916 and St George Dragons in 1963).
* In 2008, the Rabbitohs equalled the second biggest comeback in Australian Rugby League history. After being down 28–4 after 53 minutes against the North Queensland Cowboys, the Rabbitohs won the match 29–28.

The club&#x27;s players have also achieved some notable individual game and point scoring milestones:
* John Sutton holds the record for the most first grade games for the club, having played 336 matches between 2004 and 2019.
* Jack Rayner holds the individual record of the most grand final successes as a captain (5) and coach (5) achieved between 1950 and 1955.
* Adam Reynolds holds the club record for the most points, tallying 1896 points between 2012 and 2021.
* Eric Simms scored 265 points on his own for South Sydney in 1969 and this tally remains unsurpassed by any other player at the club.
* Eric Simms still holds a club and competition record for the most goals (112 goals and 19 field goals) in a season, most career field goals (86) and most field goals in a game (5).
* Johnny Graves&#x27; tally of 29 points in a match against Eastern Suburbs in 1952 remains the club record for the most individual points in a match. Had this feat been scored as it is today it would have stood at 32 points.
* Alex Johnston is the only player to score 30 tries in a single season in the NRL era. He achieved the feat in both the 2021 and 2022 seasons, the only player in Australian rugby league history to complete the feat twice.
* During his career Bob McCarthy scored 100 tries for the club, the most by a forward.
* Alex Johnston equalled the South Sydney club record of 5 tries in a 2017 match against Penrith at ANZ Stadium in a 42–14 win, joining greats such as Nathan Merritt, Harold Horder, Johnny Graves and Ian Moir. Johnston went on to score another 5 tries against the Sydney Roosters in a 60–8 win in the final round of the 2020 season.
* Alex Johnston passed Nathan Merritt&#x27;s all-time try scoring record in Souths win 44–18 against Wests Tigers in round 12 of the 2022 season, with 166 tries as of the end of the 2022 season.

<text>Signhildsberg (historically Fornsigtuna, where &quot;forn&quot; means &quot;ancient&quot;, Old Sigtuna, &quot;Sithun&quot;, &quot;Signesberg&quot;) is a manor that formerly was a royal estate (Uppsala öd), located in the parish of Håtuna approximately west of the modern town of Sigtuna, by Lake Mälaren in Sweden. Although the location is nearly forgotten, it has a central role in Norse mythology, according to which it was founded by the Norse god Odin. 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sigtuna&quot; is contested. According to one theory, it is a compound name where the second element is -&quot;&quot; and the first one is either of two closely related dialectal words, viz. &quot;sig&quot; meaning &quot;seeping water&quot; or &quot;swamp&quot; or &quot;sik&quot; meaning &quot;swamp&quot;. As a basis for this intpretation, a brook south of Signhildsberg has been mentioned, or the fact that the estate was surrounded by marshy terrain. 

Another theory considers the name to be an ancient prestigious &quot;wander toponym&quot;, meaning &quot;strong fortress&quot;, like the Celtic toponym &quot;Segodunum&quot;, from Proto-Germanic *&quot;sigatūna&quot;-, Old Norse &quot;Sigtún&quot;, cf. Proto-Germanic *&quot;&quot;- &quot;victory&quot;: Gothic &quot;&quot;, Old Norse &quot;&quot;, Old English &quot;&quot;, Old Frisian &quot;sige, sīge&quot;, Old High German &quot;&quot;.

In 1680, the name was changed to &quot;Signhildsberg&quot; after the Old Norse legend of Hagbard and Signy.

==Heimskringla==
In Chapter 5 of the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; section of his Heimskringla, Snorri Sturluson relates that Odin and the Æsir first arrived at Old Sigtuna when they came to Sweden:
:Odin took up his residence at the Maelare lake, at the place now called Old Sigtun. There he erected a large temple, where there were sacrifices according to the customs of the Asaland people. He appropriated to himself the whole of that district, and called it Sigtun. To the temple priests he gave also domains. Njord dwelt in Noatun, Freyr in Upsala, Heimdal in the Himinbergs, Thor in Thrudvang, Balder in Breidablik; to all of them he gave good estates.

Later the pirate Sölve arrived at Old Sigtuna to claim the Swedish throne: 
:Solve came unexpectedly in the night on Eystein (Östen), surrounded the house in which the king was, and burned him and all his court. Then Solve went to Sigtun, and desired that the Swedes should receive him, and give him the title of king; but they collected an army, and tried to defend the country against him, on which there was a great battle, that lasted, according to report, eleven days. There King Solve was victorious, and was afterwards king of the Swedish dominions for a long time, until at last the Swedes betrayed him, and he was killed.

In the part called &quot;The Saga of St. Olaf&quot;, the Norwegian king Olaf Haraldsson makes shore at Old Sigtuna:
:King Olaf steered thereafter eastwards to Svithjod, and into the Lag (the Mælar lake), and ravaged the land on both sides. He sailed all the way up to Sigtuna, and laid his ships close to the old Sigtuna. The Swedes say the stone-heaps are still to be seen which Olaf had laid under the ends of the gangways from the shore to the ships.

==Skaldic poetry==

In &quot;Orvar-Odd&#x27;s saga&quot;, Hjalmar laments his dying:
The location is also mentioned in other poems by the 11th-century skalds Þjóðólfr Arnórsson Valgarðr á Velli and Arnórr Þórðarson.

==&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;==
Saxo Grammaticus writes in Book 8 of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; that Sigmund, one of the warriors of the House of Yngling, came from what is chronologically Old Sigtuna to fight at the Battle of Bråvalla:
:They likewise held the god Frey to be the founder of their race. Amongst these from the town of Sigtun also came Sigmund, a champion advocate, versed in making contracts of sale and purchase; besides him Frosti surnamed Bowl: allied with him was Alf the Lofty (Proud?) from the district of Upsala; this man was a swift spear-thrower, and used to go in the front of the battle.

==Archaeology==
There are two large ruins that had been two large three-aisled halls, a series of terraces just above the shore-line of the Germanic Iron Age, traces of a harbour, a large mound and a number of smaller grave fields. Excavations have dated the remains to the Vendel Age, part of the Germanic Iron Age, and the Viking Age, i.e., from the 6th century until the 11th century.

==History==
It was an Iron Age and mediaeval royal estate (see Uppsala öd) and it was located strategically at the waterway to Old Uppsala and the Temple at Uppsala. In the 10th century, the name was transferred to modern Sigtuna, which apparently assumed many of its functions.

*It is mentioned in the 1170s when Pope Alexander III addresses king Knut Eriksson and Jarl Birger Brosa (&quot;Svenskt Diplomatarium I nr 852. Originalbrev&quot;). The pope demands that they return to the archbishop of Uppsala (until 1270 the name referred to Gamla Uppsala) the villages &quot;Strom&quot; (Ström in the parish of Norrsunda), Fornesitune and &quot;Guazbro&quot; (probably Vadsbro). The villages had earlier belonged to the bishop of Sigtuna, but they had been confiscated by the crown when the bishopric had been moved to Gamla Uppsala.
*In 1299, Birger Magnusson, the son of Magnus Ladulås, spent some time in Old Sigtuna as one of his letters was written in Sightonia Antiqua (in Malmberg, Ernst: &quot;Svenska slott och herresäten&quot;) or apud antiquam Sightoniam The difference seems to be a matter of presenting the name in the nominal case or preserving the case in which the name appeared in the original text.
*In 1315, according to &quot;Svenskt Diplomatarium (SD) III nr 2032 (s.228)&quot;, Duke Erik Magnusson was bestowed a part of Old Sigtuna, which is called Siktonia vetus (&quot;vetus&quot; being Latin for &quot;old&quot;). Neighbouring properties are also named: &quot;Norgungi&quot; (Norränge in Håtuna) and &quot;Frötunum&quot; (Frötuna in Håbo-Tibble)
*In 1541, according to &quot;Kammar-ark.: jordeböcker, Uppland 1541 nr 5&quot;, the location is named as one of Gustav I Vasa&#x27;s estates and spelled Forsictuna, Foorsictuna and Fforssiiktwna (in Malmberg, Ernst: &quot;Svenska slott och herresäten&quot;).
*In 1542, according to &quot;Gustav Vasas jordebok&quot; are mentioned Foorsictuna and &quot;Norringe&quot; (Norränge)
*In 1551, according to &quot;Sven Nielssons jordebok för Stäkets län&quot;, it is mentioned as the royal estate of Forsictuna (Malmberg, Ernst: &quot;Svenska slott och herresäten&quot; and Friesen: &quot;Om staden Sigtunas ålder&quot;).
*In 1567, it is mentioned as Foder Sictuna in the province of Uppland
*In the 17th century, the name Försigtuna is used on a map (&quot;Lantmät.verk. Gävle&quot;).

Since the 17th century, the location has been a manor named &quot;Signhildsberg&quot; or &quot;Signesberg&quot;.

<text>The Hyperoliidae, or sedge frogs and bush frogs, are a large family of small to medium-sized, brightly colored frogs which contain more than 250 species in 19 genera. Seventeen genera are native to sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the monotypic genus &quot;Tachycnemis&quot; occurs on the Seychelles Islands, and the genus &quot;Heterixalus&quot; (currently 10 species) is endemic to Madagascar.

Hyperoliids range from in body length. Many species have smooth, brightly patterned skin that almost looks enameled.

Most hyperoliids are arboreal, but some are terrestrial, including several &quot;Kassina&quot; species that move by walking or running rather than hopping. Diets vary widely, with examples including &quot;Paracassina&quot;, which specializes in snails, and &quot;Afrixalus fornasini&quot;, the only terrestrial frog known to prey on eggs of other species of anurans.

Breeding in this family begins at the start of the rainy season, when hyperoliids congregate at breeding sites. Most hyperoliids lay their eggs in water, although foam nesting, tree-hole breeding, and laying eggs in vegetation above water are all known behaviors. &quot;Afrixalus&quot; builds leaf nests for its eggs, by folding and gluing the edges of the leaves. Tadpoles are pond type larvae with large dorsal fins on their tails.

No fossil hyperoliids are known.

==Classification==
As of mid-2022, there are 17 genera with 224 species, more than half of them in the very species-rich &quot;Hyperolius&quot;: The genera are divided between three subfamilies, with three genera unplaced.

** &quot;Congolius&quot; - Congo frog (1 species)
** &quot;Cryptothylax&quot; - wax frogs (2 species)
** &quot;Heterixalus&quot; - Madagascan reed frogs (11 species)
** &quot;Hyperolius&quot; - African reed frogs (143 species)
** &quot;Kassinula&quot; - clicking frog (1 species)
** &quot;Morerella&quot; - blue-eyed frog (1 species)
** &quot;Opisthothylax&quot; - grey-eyed frog (1 species)
** &quot;Tachycnemis&quot; - Seychelles Islands frog (1 species)
* Subfamily Kassininae Laurent, 1972 (23 sp.)
** &quot;Hylambates&quot; - African striped frogs (5 species; formerly &quot;Phlyctimantis) 
** &quot;Kassina&quot; - running frogs (15 species)
** &quot;Paracassina&quot; - common striped frogs (2 species)
** &quot;Semnodactylus&quot; - Weal&#x27;s frog (1 species)
* Subfamily &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
** &quot;Arlequinus&quot; - Mebebque frog (1 species)

<text>Metal Mickey is a fictional five-foot-tall robot, as well as the name of a spin-off television show starring the same character. The robot character was created, controlled and voiced (using a Vocoder) by Johnny Edward.

The character of Metal Mickey first appeared on British television in the ITV children&#x27;s magazine show &quot;The Saturday Banana&quot;, produced by Southern Television in 1978. Humphrey Barclay saw Mickey on Jimmy Savile&#x27;s &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; television show. Seeing the children chatting in the marketplace with the friendly robot led to the creation of the &quot;Metal Mickey&quot; television show. Within a month the pilot had been video-taped, and shortly after this the series went live with its first six episodes. 41 episodes were made in total, broadcast over three separate series between September 1980 and January 1983. The show attracted viewing figures of around 12 million at its peak. Micky Dolenz, formerly of The Monkees pop group, was brought in to produce and direct the series along with Nic Phillips and David Crossman.

In 2001, the show was voted number 58 in Channel 4’s 100 Greatest Kids TV Shows.

==&quot;Metal Mickey&quot; television show==

The television show was created under LWT&#x27;s Humphrey Barclay who described &quot;Metal Mickey&quot; as a show &quot;with the appeal of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the Daleks and &quot;Mork and Mindy&quot;&quot;. It ran from 1980 to 1983.

The series was set in the home of an ordinary British family, whose youngest child was a science boffin, who had created Metal Mickey to help around the home. The family consisted of a mother and father, three children and a grandmother. The show was made by London Weekend Television and shown on the ITV network, with the entire run of 41 episodes being written by comedy writer Colin Bostock-Smith.

British comedy actress Irene Handl played the grandmother, whom Mickey affectionately called &quot;my little fruitbat&quot; (she in turn would call him &quot;Fluff&quot;). He also referred to his inventor as &quot;Clever Clogs&quot;, his inventor&#x27;s sister as &quot;Stringbean&quot; and their father as &quot;Bootface&quot;. Handl was never at home with science fiction, either watching it or appearing in it. She famously told BBC presenter Noel Edmonds, when he asked her whether she cried over the death of E.T., &quot;Why should I cry over a bleedin&#x27; Hoover attachment?&quot;

Metal Mickey&#x27;s catchphrase was &quot;boogie, boogie&quot;, and his favourite treat were Atomic Thunderbusters (which had the appearance of lemon bonbons). At the height of the series&#x27; popularity, fizzbomb sweets were marketed in the UK under the name Metal Mickey&#x27;s Atomic Thunderbusters.

<text>The Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) is part of the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford in England. Its mission is to achieve practical solutions to conservation problems through original scientific research, training conservation scientists to conduct research, putting scientific knowledge into practice, and educating and involving the public to achieve lasting solutions.

The Unit was founded in 1986 by Professor David W. Macdonald. In 2022 Professor Amy Dickman took over from David W. Macdonald as Director. Members come from more than 30 countries and many have returned to hold influential roles in conservation. WildCRU research has been used to advise policy-makers worldwide. More than 300 scientific papers and 25 reports have been published, over a hundred fruitful collaborations have been fostered, and over 45 students have completed doctoral theses.

WildCRU projects use all four elements of their Conservation Quartet: research to understand the problem, education to explain it, community involvement to ensure participation and acceptance, and implementation of a solution. The approach is interdisciplinary, linking to public health, community development and animal welfare. In a new initiative concerning ‘biodiversity and business’, WildCRU is working directly to influence policy making processes in industry.

Current project areas include saving endangered species, resolving conflict, reconciling farming and wildlife, researching fundamental ecology, and managing wildlife diseases, pests and invasive species.

Specific projects include protecting the Ethiopian wolf, Grevy&#x27;s zebra and endemic birds in the Galapagos Islands, finding solutions to bushmeat exploitation in West Africa, community conservation education in Africa, sustainable farming, badger ecology and behavior, and the impact of American mink on native wildlife in Britain, Belarus, and Argentina.

WildCRU is located in Tubney House, Abingdon Road, Tubney, Oxfordshire.

<text>Raymond Otis Boone (July 27, 1923 – October 17, 2004) was an American professional baseball infielder and scout who played in Major League Baseball (MLB). Primarily a third baseman and shortstop, he was a two-time American League All-Star ( and ), and led his league in runs batted in with 116 in .

In a thirteen-year career, he hit .275 with 151 home runs and 737 runs batted in (RBIs) in 1,373 games for the Indians, Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, Kansas City Athletics, Milwaukee Braves and Boston Red Sox. His 1,260 hits also included 162 doubles and 46 triples.

=== Cleveland Indians ===

==== Early career ====
Ray Boone signed his first professional contract with the Cleveland Indians in 1942 at age 18. He received a $500 signing bonus and began playing for the Indian&#x27;s Class C team in Wausau, Wisconsin. In 1942, Boone played in 89 games. He batted .306, had 41 RBIs, 13 doubles, eight triples, and four home runs.

After the 1942 season, Boone enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II, putting his baseball career on hold. During the next three years, Boone served at the San Diego Naval Training Center. The training center had a baseball team, which Boone played for on the weekends alongside Bob Lemon and George Vico, both future major leaguers.

==== Post-war ====
In 1946, Boone played 77 games for Wilkes-Barre in the Class A Eastern League. He batted .258, producing 31 RBIs, and four home runs.

During the 1947 season, the Indians transferred Boone to the Double-A Texas League in Oklahoma City. In 1947 he played in 130 games, serving as catcher for more than 100 of them. Boone batted .264, producing 48 RBIs and four home runs in 402 plate appearances. Toward the end of the 1947 season, Boone was asked to play shortstop, which he did for more than 20 games.

In 1948, Boone traveled to Tucson, Arizona for the Indians’ spring training. At this time, Boone was given the option by Lou Boudreau, of being a backup shortstop in the major leagues or the starting shortstop in the minors. Boone initially decided to play in the majors, but after sitting on the bench for three weeks, he made the transition back to the minors as a backup. In 87 games in the Texas League, Boone batted .353 over 318 at-bats, producing 48 RBIs, 16 doubles, nine triples, and three home runs.

Boone debuted in the major leagues on September 3, 1948, when he was called up by the Cleveland Indians. That year, he went on to play in his first World Series. In the eighth inning of game five, Boone was sent in to pinch hit. He struck out swinging against Warren Spahn. During the 1948 World Series, the Indians defeated the Boston Braves in six games.

In 1949, Boone played his first full rookie season. Playing in 86 games with a batting average of .252. During the 1950 season, Boone batted .301, producing 58 RBIs and seven home runs. Boone&#x27;s batting average dropped to .233 in the 1951 season, with an increase in appearances. He produced 12 home runs and 51 RBIs over 151 games, with 544 plate appearances. During that year, Boone&#x27;s home runs ranked second among league shortstops. His RBIs ranked third among league shortstops.

In 1952, Boone&#x27;s batting average was .263. He sustained multiple injuries that year, including a torn ligament in the left knee. In August 1952, Boone committed six errors over four games. On August 24, during a game with the Washington Senators, Boone&#x27;s two errors resulted in six unearned runs. The Senators won the game and the Indians dropped in league rankings to fall behind the New York Yankees.

=== Detroit Tigers ===
On June 14, 1953, Boone was traded to the Detroit Tigers from the Cleveland Indians along with Steve Gromek in a swap that saw Art Houtteman and Joe Ginsberg sent to the Indians.
The Tigers switched Boone from shortstop (then occupied by the future Rookie of the Year Harvey Kuenn) to third base. Boone&#x27;s first game with the Tigers was on June 16, 1953, in Fenway Park. The Tigers won 5–3 over the Red Sox. During the game, Boone fielded six times without error. He produced one go-ahead home run against pitcher Sid Hudson in the seventh inning, along with two walks, a double, and a single. The rest of the 1953 season, Boone hit four grand slams, tying the major league record at the time. That year, Boone produced 93 RBIs.

Ahead of the 1954 season, Boone signed a new contract with the Tigers for $25,000. That contract made him the highest paid player on the team. In 1954, Boone batted .295, and produced 85 RBIs and 20 home runs. He was voted into the 1954 MLB All-Star Game, in which he batted sixth and hit a home run.

Over 135 games and 500 plate appearances during the 1955 season, Boone batted .284, hit 20 home runs, and produced 116 runs. Boone hit a career high in RBIs, which tied him for first place in the American League with Jackie Jensen.

In 1956, Boone batted .306. He produced 81 RBIs and 25 home runs. Boone experienced worsening health problems, and had to make multiple trips to medical clinics to receive cortisone shots in his knees. Because of his knee problems, manager Jack Tighe moved Boone from third to first base. During the 1957 season, Boone batted .273, producing 65 RBIs and 12 home runs. He played four games at third and 117 at first.

During the first three months of the 1958 season, Boone batted .237.

=== Chicago White Sox ===
On June 15, 1958, Ray Boone was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with Bob Shaw in exchange for Bill Fischer and Tito Francona. During the remainder of the 1958 season, Boone batted .244, which brought his season average to .242. Combined figures from Boone&#x27;s time with the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers in 1958 included 360 at-bats, 61 RBIs, and 13 home runs. Boone would go on to play through April 1959 for the White Sox.

=== Kansas City Athletics ===
On May 3, 1959, Boone was traded from the White Sox to the Kansas City Athletics in exchange for Harry “Suitcase” Simpson. He batted .273 over 61 games, and was put up for waivers on August 20, 1959.

=== Milwaukee Braves ===
On August 20, 1959, Boone was picked up on waivers by the Milwaukee Braves. He served as a backup, playing in 13 games and going 3-for-15 with a .200 batting average, two RBIs, and one home run. During the 1960 season, Boone sat on the bench with the Braves until mid-May.

=== Boston Red Sox ===
On May 17, 1960, Boone was traded to the Boston Red Sox. During that season, Boone batted .211 and produced one home run and 15 RBIs over 51 games (34 with the Red Sox, 17 with the Milwaukee Braves).

On August 24, 1960, Boone underwent back surgery. His career as a professional baseball player came to an end.

== Scout ==
Near the end of the 1960 season, after having undergone back surgery and retiring from playing, Boone was invited to watch a game on TV with then-Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey. Yawkey hired Boone to become a scout for the Red Sox. He worked in the position until he retired on December 31, 1992.

Boone&#x27;s scouting territory included all of Arizona and New Mexico, as well as California south of Laguna Beach. The scouting job involved studying players at high school and college games, as well as college development league games, minor league games, and Padres games.

Regarding his determination on whether to recommend a particular prospect to the Red Sox, Boone said, “I don’t worry if a kid gets four hits in a game. I want to see the basic tools--his arm, his swing and his fielding. I want to know if this kid can improve. A kid can’t go out there and be lackadaisical and flip the ball around and think somebody is going to be interested.”

== Personal life ==
Ray Boone was married to Patsy Dorothy (Brown) Boone, who was born in San Diego on March 17, 1926, and died on May 11, 2008. She and Ray Boone had been high school sweethearts. Together, they had three children: Bob and Rod Boone, and Terry Strandemo. His son Rod played in the Houston Astros’ farm system. Terry competed in the 1968 Olympic trials as a swimmer. 
Boone was followed into the majors by son, Bob Boone, who was a catcher from 1972 to 1990 and grandsons Bret Boone, who played from 1992 to 2005, and Aaron Boone, who played 1997 to 2009. The Boone family was the first to send three generations of players to the All-Star Game. The Washington Nationals organization selected Ray&#x27;s great-grandson, Jake (Bret&#x27;s son) in the 2017 draft, and as of 2021 he was playing for the Low-A minor league team Fredericksburg Nationals.

In 1973, Boone was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing field.

He was well known as the leader of the local San Diego National Lumberjack Association chapter.

Boone was a descendant of American pioneer Daniel Boone.

== Death ==
Boone died from a heart attack at the age of 81 on October 17, 2004, in San Diego. He had been hospitalized for six months for complications due to intestinal surgery. Boone was survived by his wife, Patsy, his sons, Bob and Rod, his daughter, Terry, nine grandchildren, including former MLBer and Yankees manager Aaron Boone, and five great-grandchildren. Following Boone&#x27;s death, the Red Sox held a moment of silence in his honor during Game four of a playoff series with the Yankees at Fenway Park. The memorial service for Ray Boone was held on October 24, 2004. Ray&#x27;s grandchild, Bret Boone completed the eulogy. Bret said, “All the stories I saw referred to (Ray) as the patriarch of the Boone family. I looked up the word ‘patriarch’ to see exactly what that meant. It said a patriarch was the father and ruler of the family. That&#x27;s what Gramps was.”

Boone is buried in El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego, California.

<text>A Short Film About Love () is a 1988 Polish romantic drama film directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski, starring Grażyna Szapołowska and Olaf Lubaszenko. Written by Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the film is about a young post office worker deeply in love with a promiscuous older woman who lives in an adjacent apartment building. The film is set in Warsaw, the Polish capital.

&quot;A Short Film About Love&quot; is an expanded film version of &quot;&quot;, part of Kieślowski&#x27;s 1988 Polish language ten-part television series, &quot;Dekalog&quot;. The film was selected as the Polish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 61st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Plot==
Nineteen-year-old Tomek (Olaf Lubaszenko) lives in an apartment complex in Warsaw with his godmother (Stefania Iwinska) - staying in her son&#x27;s room while he is away. Raised in an orphanage, Tomek has few friends and works as a postal clerk. Tomek has been spying on a beautiful older woman, Magda (Grażyna Szapolowska), who lives in an adjacent apartment complex. Using a telescope, he watches her every night performing mundane tasks, working on her artwork, and entertaining men. To get closer to her, he slips fake postal notices in her mailbox for a nonexistent money order at his post office. He also calls her anonymously to hear her voice. Tomek&#x27;s obsession is focused more on her everyday activities rather than her sex life; when he sees her becoming sexual with men, he throws the telescope away and does not watch.

Tomek learns there is a problem with the milk deliveries for Magda&#x27;s apartment complex, so he takes the delivery job to be closer to her. One night he sees her return home after breaking up with her latest boyfriend, spilling a bottle of milk, and then weeping over another failed relationship. Later, Tomek asks his godmother, &quot;Why do people cry?&quot; After receiving another fake postal notice, Magda has a confrontation with the postmistress who accuses her of extortion. When Magda walks away upset, Tomek follows her and admits that he has been leaving the fake postal notices, that he saw her crying, and that he has been watching her. That night, Magda arranges her bed so that Tomek can see her with another boyfriend. When they&#x27;re in bed, she tells him that they&#x27;re being watched by someone across the way. The boyfriend rushes down to the street, calls out to Tomek who comes downstairs, and then punches him in the face for peeping.

The next day, while delivering milk to Magda, Tomek admits that he loves her and that he expects nothing in return. Overwhelmed by his feelings, Tomek rushes up to the roof of the building, and then returns to Magda&#x27;s apartment and asks her for a date — and she accepts. Feeling elated, Tomek races through the courtyard with his milk cart. During their date at a café, Magda learns that Tomek has been watching her for a year and that he stole letters mailed to her by an old boyfriend. At first, she is upset, but then she dismisses it saying, &quot;What does it matter.&quot; In response to his earlier declaration of love, she tells him that love doesn&#x27;t exist — only sex. She shows him how to caress her hands the way lovers do.

Later that night at her apartment, after she showers and changes into a short bathrobe, he gives her a small gift, but she says she&#x27;s not a good person and doesn&#x27;t deserve gifts. Crouching in front of him, she guides his hands onto her thighs and he has an orgasm. Magda says, &quot;Love ... that&#x27;s all it is.&quot; After Tomek rushes out of her apartment embarrassed and upset, Magda feels guilty and tries to communicate with him through her window—gesturing for him to call her and holding up a sign that reads, &quot;Come back. Sorry.&quot; But there is no response. Back in his apartment, Tomek cuts his wrists with a razor blade. Later, Magda comes to Tomek&#x27;s apartment to return the coat he left behind and learns from his godmother that he tried to kill himself and was taken to the hospital. Magda tells her, &quot;I think I hurt him.&quot; Tomek&#x27;s godmother shows her his room and his telescope, then tells her, &quot;He&#x27;s fallen in love with you.&quot; When asked if he&#x27;s &quot;fallen for the wrong woman,&quot; Magda responds, &quot;Yes.&quot;

In the coming days, Magda is unable to find Tomek—she is clearly worried and concerned about his wellbeing. One night, she receives a phone call, and thinking it is Tomek, she acknowledges that he was right about love (the call is actually from someone with phone trouble). After days of waiting and watching Tomek&#x27;s window with her small binoculars, she finally sees he has returned. Magda goes to Tomek&#x27;s apartment and his godmother shows her to his room where she sees Tomek sleeping, his wrists still bandaged. The godmother prevents her from getting too close to him—even preventing her from touching his bandaged wrist. Noticing the telescope, Magda looks through it toward her own apartment and imagines what Tomek must have seen that night, watching her come home, spilling the milk, and weeping over another failed relationship. Then she closes her eyes and imagines Tomek in her apartment with her, reaching out to comfort her—and she smiles.

==Production==

===Script===
The film is based on Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, with minor changes and expansions. The most significant change is to the ending, which was rewritten at the suggestion of lead actress Grażyna Szapołowska, who wanted the film to have a &quot;fairy tale ending&quot;. The original version ends with Tomek back at work, recovered from his attempted suicide, and telling Magda that he does not watch her anymore. The film ends with Magda&#x27;s more developed concern for Tomek mirroring his earlier obsession with her. The film concludes in Tomek&#x27;s room after his return from hospital. She looks through his telescope into her own apartment and Kieślowski replays an earlier scene of Magda crying in her kitchen, which had led Tomek to reveal his feelings to her, only this time she is joined and comforted by Tomek. Like Kieślowski&#x27;s other &quot;Dekalog&quot; films, it features the mysterious angelic Man in White.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;A Short Film About Love&quot; received very positive critical reviews, with many of the critics noting that the film points to Kieslowski&#x27;s later masterworks. In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephan Holden wrote that the film &quot;which has rich, subtly shaded performances by Mr. Lubaszenko and Miss Szapolowska, has a bleak eloquence.&quot;

In his review in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Edward Guthmann called the film &quot;well-crafted and satisfying&quot; and prefigured Kieślowski&#x27;s film &quot;Three Colors: Red&quot;.

Also reviewing at the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Gary Kamiya wrote, &quot;Kieslowski has crafted a compelling portrait of love, that weed that forces its strange way through life&#x27;s hardest cement.&quot;

In his review on &quot;Cinema Sights&quot;, James Blake Ewing called the film, &quot;a complex and perplexing examination of a simple rule&quot; and praised the outcome:
Critic James Berardinelli gave it 4 out of 4 stars and called it &quot;nothing short of a masterpiece.&quot;

<text>In these lists of mountains in Ireland, those within Northern Ireland, or on the Republic of Ireland – United Kingdom border, are marked with an asterisk, while the rest are within the Republic of Ireland. Where mountains are ranked by height, the definition of the topographical prominence used to classify the mountain (e.g. the change in elevation required between neighbouring mountains), is noted. In British definitions, a height of is required for a mountain, whereas in Ireland, a lower threshold of is sometimes advocated.

The lowest minimum prominence threshold of any definition of an Irish mountain is (e.g. the Vandeleur-Lynam), however most definitions, including the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) criteria, do not consider prominences below as being mountains (e.g. must at least be an Arderin or a Hewitt). Many British definitions consider a peak with a prominence below , as being a &quot;top&quot;, and not a mountain (e.g. must be a Marilyn). A widely used definition of an Irish mountain requires a minimum prominence of (e.g. a HuMP), and is the basis for the &quot;100 Highest Irish Mountains&quot;.

While Irish mountains are ranked according to Irish classifications, they are also ranked on classifications that cover Great Britain and Ireland (e.g. Simms and P600s).

==Definitions==
===General concepts===

There is no consensus on the definition of &quot;mountain&quot;, but in Britain and Ireland it is often taken to be a summit over 2,000 ft, or more latterly, 600 m. There is less consensus about the topographical prominence requirement (e.g. the change in elevation required between neighbouring mountains), which can vary between . Prominence is even strongly debated regarding UIAA classification of Himalayan mountains. In the alps, the UIAA requires a prominence of over 30 m to be a &quot;peak&quot; and over 300 m to be a &quot;mountain&quot;.

The lowest threshold of prominence in Britain and Ireland is . The only definition in which prominence is not used, is where topographic isolation is used (e.g. the use of &quot;sufficient separation&quot; for Munros). Most Britain and Ireland definitions no longer categorise prominences below (e.g. no new Nuttalls and Vandeleur-Lynams), and peaks with a prominence between are now defined as tops rather than mountains (e.g. the 227 Munro Tops).

In Ireland, a prominence threshold of is proposed for a mountain.

===Main classifications===

===Other classifications===

The term Dillon is used to describe any of the 212 Irish summits in Paddy Dillon&#x27;s well–regarded Irish 2010 climbing guidebook: &quot;The Mountains of Ireland&quot;. All of Dillon&#x27;s summits are over , and almost all have a prominence above (i.e. they are very similar to the list of 209 Irish Hewitts).

The term Myrddyn Deweys are peaks in Ireland, between 500 metres to in height, with a prominence above , which was published by Michael Dewey and Myrddyn Phillips in 2000. Myrddyn Deweys are the Irish equivalent of Deweys, which extend the Hewitt classification down to 500 metres. There are 200 Myrddyn Deweys.

===&quot;MountainViews Online Database&quot; ===

MountainViews was created in 2002 by Simon Stewart as a non–profit online database for climbers in Ireland to document and catalogue their Irish climbs. Its main data source are from the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) maps, although it also conducts its own surveys, which the OSI has integrated into its own database, and it also integrates other important Irish mountain databases such as the Paul Tempan&#x27;s work with the Placenames Database of Ireland (Loganim). Collins Press published the MountainView Online Datase in 2013 in the book: &quot;A Guide to Ireland&#x27;s Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins&quot;.

Since 2012, MountainViews has been partnered with the &quot;Database of British and Irish Hills&quot; (DoBIH), which is the main live database for the categorisation of mountains and hills in Britain and Ireland. However, MountainViews can differ slightly from DoBIH on the measurements for certain Irish mountains.

==List of the 10 Highest MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks==

The MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks range contains Ireland&#x27;s highest mountain, Carrauntoohil , and the Reeks is the highest range of peaks in Ireland. However, many of its peaks do not meet all classification criteria for a &quot;mountain&quot; (e.g. particularly the in elevation change from neighbouring mountains), and many are not in the &quot;100 Highest Irish Mountains&quot;. Regardless, the range contains ten of the thirteen Scottish Furths in Ireland, and given its importance, and as an important example of complexity of mountain classification, the ten highest Reeks are listed below:

==&quot;100 Highest Irish Mountains&quot; ==

(any height, prominence over 100 m)

This is the MountainViews &quot;100 Highest Irish Mountains&quot; list, which was published by Collins Press in the 2013 book: &quot;A Guide to Ireland&#x27;s Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins&quot;. It combines Paul Tempan&#x27;s 2012 research into Irish mountains and Irish mountain names. The list requires a prominence of over , a compromise between the popular British Isles Marilyn criteria of 150 metres (see List of Marilyns in the British Isles for a ranking of Irish Marilyns by height and by prominence), and the Simms–Hewitt–Arderins criteria of 30 metres (see List of mountains of the British Isles by height for a ranking of Irish Simms by height and by prominence). It is a widely used list, and it contains 25 of the 26 Irish P600s (Slieve Snaght, a P600, did not make the 100 Highest).


==List of &quot;409 Irish Arderins&quot; ==

(height above 500 m, prominence over 30 m)

A noted definition of an Irish mountain over the lower height threshold of , is the Arderins list, but which meets the minimum requirement for a &quot;mountain&quot; with a prominence above , and is an Irish equivalent of the Hewitt (the 207 Arderins over are the 207–209 Irish Hewitts), or the Simm (the 222 Arderins over are the 222–224 Irish Simms). The 199 Arderins below are the Myrddyn Deweys (e.g. the total of the 207 Irish Hewitts and the 199 Myrddyn Deweys equal the 406 Irish Arderins).

MountainView&#x27;s Online Database of Arderins was published by Collins Press in the 2013 book: &quot;A Guide to Ireland&#x27;s Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins&quot;, and updated in 2015. In 2023, the MountainView Online Database listed 409 Irish mountains as meeting the Arderin definition. Several of the MountainViews.ie users have recorded completing the entire list of Arderins. One user having completed the Arderins within one single year (2014) along with the complete list of Vandeleur-Lynams, county highpoints and the highest 100 list.

MountainViews uses the term Arderin Begs for the additional class of peaks over in height, and with a prominence between . In 2018, Ireland had 124 Arderin Begs.

==List of &quot;275 Irish Vandeleur-Lynams&quot; ==

(height above 600 m, prominence over 15 m)

The broadest noted definition of an Irish mountain over is the Vandeleur-Lynam list, as it only requires a prominence of , and is the Irish fully metric equivalent of the England &amp; Wales Nuttall. The &quot;100 Highest Irish Mountains&quot; from above, is a &quot;subset&quot; of this list (e.g. they are all Vandeleur-Lynams). For example, Mweelrea, the highest mountain in Connacht, is 16th on the &quot;100 Highest Irish Mountains&quot; list, but 34th on the Vandeleur-Lynam list. MountainView&#x27;s Online Database of Vandeleur-Lynams was published by Collins Press in the 2013 book: &quot;A Guide to Ireland&#x27;s Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams &amp; the Arderins&quot;, and updated in 2015. In 2023, the MountainView Online Database lists 275 Irish mountains as meeting the Vandeleur-Lynam definition.

On 3 October 2018, English Lake District climber, James Forrest, completed all 273 Irish Vandeleur-Lynams in 8 weeks. In 2023, Irish photographer and adventurer Ellie Berry completed the Vandeleur-Lynams, now 275 peaks, in 50 days and 5 hours beating the previous record by 6 days. This record was in turn broken in 2024 by Kerryman Sean Clifford who scaled all 275 peaks in 21 days, 2 hours, and 46 minutes.

==Ranking of Irish mountains in Ireland and Britain==

Whereas the MountainViews, Vandeleur-Lynam, and Arderin classifications are unique to Ireland, Irish mountains appear in other similar classifications that have been used in across Britain and Ireland.

===Simms===

The Britain and Ireland Simms classification (height over 600 m, and prominence above 30 m), is very similar to the Irish Arderin classification (height over 500 m, and prominence over 30 m). , the 2,754 Simms in Britain and Ireland, which include 224 Irish Simms (i.e. the Irish Arderins over 600 m), are ranked by height, and by prominence, on this table:

* List of mountains of the British Isles by height, for ranking by height and by prominence, of peaks that are Simms, with prominence over 

===Hewitts===

Irish Hewitts, which have largely been replaced by the metric Simms classification, are ranked against English and Welsh Hewitts on these tables:

* List of Hewitt mountains in England, Wales and Ireland, for ranking by height, of peaks that are Hewitts, with prominence over 

===Marilyns===

The popular Britain and Ireland Marilyn classification (any height, and prominence above 150 m), is a more severe prominence threshold than the Irish Mountainviews classification (height over 500 m, and prominence over 100 m). , the 2,011 Marilyns in Britain and Ireland, which include 454 Irish Marilyns (e.g. the amount is larger because Marilyns will take any height, as long as the peak meets the prominence threshold), are ranked by prominence, and by height, here (note that this list is commonly used to rank by prominence, as it includes any peak with prominence above 150 m):

* List of Marilyns in the British Isles, for ranking by height and by prominence, of peaks that are Marilyns, with prominence over 

===P600s===

The Britain and Ireland P600 classification require a prominence above 600 m (e.g. and by definition, the height must, therefore, be above 600 m), and are thus called the &quot;Majors&quot;. , the 120 P600s in Britain and Ireland, which include 26 Irish P600s, are ranked by height here:

* List of P600 mountains in the British Isles, for ranking by height and by prominence, of peaks that are P600s, with prominence over 

===Furths===

Finally, the Scottish Furth classification is for mountains that the Scottish Mountaineering Club (&quot;SMC&quot;) identify as meeting the classification for a Scottish Munro, however, they are outside (e.g. they are &quot;furth&quot;) of Scotland. , the 34 Furths in Britain and Ireland, which includes 13 Irish Furths, are ranked by height here:

The victims lived in Portland, Seaside, Oregon and in Oakridge, Oregon. Vlazny issued a statement of apology that was delivered in masses throughout the archdiocese.

In July 2004, the archdiocese became the first American diocese to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy in response to the Catholic sex abuse cases. Vlazny described his actions by saying, &quot;This is not an effort to avoid responsibility. It is, in fact, the only way I can assure that other claimants can be offered fair compensation.&quot;

In January 2010, Vlazny defended his loan of money to Reverend Angel Armando Perez to cover his legal expenses, Perez had been indicted in Marion County, Oregon, on first-degree sexual abuse and abuse of a child in the display of sexually explicit conduct. While condemning Perez&#x27;s alleged criminal actions. Vlazny expressed a need to help a fellow priest.

In April 2010, Vlazny called for parishioners to cancel their subscriptions to &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, declaring it guilty of &quot;Catholic bashing.&quot; The newspaper&#x27;s editors, he said, &quot;arrogantly scolded the church for its past failures in handling this matter of child sexual abuse.&quot; The newspaper had run an editorial, an editorial cartoon and a syndicated column by E.J. Dionne on how the church had dealt with sexual abuse crime. 

On January 29, 2013, Pope Benedict XVI announced the acceptance of Vlazny&#x27;s resignation as archbishop of Portland, with Bishop Alexander Sample to succeed him.

== Viewpoints ==

=== Euthanasia ===
An opponent of assisted suicide, Vlazny supported the unsuccessful repeal of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, saying,&quot;Many have expressed a dread about what will happen when the power over life and death may be put into the hands of a society that is driven by economics, expedience and efficiency, a society that flees from suffering, weakness or limitations of any kind.&quot; In 1998, when the first legal assisted suicide occurred in Oregon, Vlazny declared that the death &quot;can only bring anguish to those who have resisted the public policy initiatives that changed the law in Oregon.&quot;

=== Abortion ===
During the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Vlazny said Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights, such as Democratic presidential nominee Senator John Kerry, should refrain from receiving communion.

<text>Douglas Craig Bennett (October 31, 1951 – October 16, 2004) was the lead singer of Canadian rock band Doug and the Slugs. He also produced and directed music videos for artists such as Headpins, Trooper, Zappacosta, Suzanne Gitzi, and Images in Vogue as well as for the Slugs themselves.

Born in Toronto, Bennett moved to Vancouver in 1973. In 1977, he formed Doug and the Slugs and the band toured extensively through North America in the 1980s. Bennett wrote or co-wrote such songs as &quot;Too Bad&quot;, &quot;Day By Day&quot;, &quot;Making It Work&quot;, and &quot;Tomcat Prowl.&quot;

Besides works with Doug and the Slugs, Bennett released a solo album, &quot;Animato&quot;, in 1986.

Bennett died in Calgary on October 16, 2004, after a lengthy illness, a week after falling into a coma.

He was the subject of the documentary &quot;Doug and the Slugs and Me&quot; by director Teresa Alfeld, which had its world premiere at the 2022 DOXA Documentary Film Festival.

<doc id="1080008" wikidata="Q234795" url="?curid=1080008" title="Alla Nazimova">
<text>Alla Aleksandrovna Nazimova (, born Marem-Ides Leventon; June 3 O.S. May 22], 1879 – July 13, 1945) was a Ukrainian-American actress, director, producer and screenwriter.

On Broadway, she was noted for her work in the classic plays of Ibsen, Chekhov and Turgenev. She later moved on to film, where she served many production roles, both writing and directing films under pseudonyms. Her film &quot;Salome&quot; (1922) is regarded as a cultural landmark. Nazimova was bisexual and openly conducted relationships with women while being married to a man. She created the Garden of Alla hotel which became a retreat for many celebrities of the time. She is credited with having originated the phrase &quot;sewing circle&quot; as a discreet code for lesbian or bisexual actresses.

==Early life==
Nazimova was born Marem-Ides Leventon (Russian name: &quot;Adelaida Yakovlevna Leventon&quot;) in Yalta, Crimea, Russian Empire. Her accepted birth year is 1879, but different sources have cited 1878 or even 1876. Her stage name Alla Nazimova was a combination of Alla (a diminutive of Adelaida) and the surname of Nadezhda Nazimova, the heroine of the Russian novel &quot;Children of the Streets&quot;. She was widely known as just Nazimova. Her name was sometimes transcribed as Alia Nasimoff.

The youngest of three children born to Jewish parents Yakov Abramovich Leventon, a pharmacist, and Sarah Leivievna Gorowitz (later known as Sofia or Sophie Lvovna Gorovitz/Horovitz/Herowitz), who moved to Yalta in 1870 from Kishinev, Nazimova grew up in a dysfunctional family. Her parents divorced when she was eight and she was shuffled among boarding schools, foster homes and relatives. As a teenager, she began to pursue an interest in the theatre and took acting lessons at the Academy of Acting in Moscow. She joined Constantin Stanislavski&#x27;s Moscow Art Theatre using the name of Alla Nazimova for the first time.

==Career==

Nazimova&#x27;s theater career blossomed early, and by 1903, she was a major star in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. She toured Europe, including London and Berlin, with her boyfriend Pavel Orlenev, a flamboyant actor and producer. In 1905, they moved to New York City and founded a Russian-language theater on the Lower East Side. The venture was unsuccessful, and Orlenev returned to Russia while Nazimova stayed in New York.

She was signed by the American producer Henry Miller and made her Broadway debut in New York City in 1906 to critical and popular success. Her English-language premiere in November 1906 was in the title role of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;. She reportedly learned English in five months. She quickly became extremely popular (Nazimova&#x27;s 39th Street Theatre was named after her) and remained a major Broadway star, often starring in works by Ibsen and Chekhov. Dorothy Parker described her as the finest Hedda Gabler she had ever seen.

Nazimova&#x27;s film career began when she was 37 years old. Due to her notoriety in a 35-minute 1915 play entitled &quot;War Brides&quot;, Nazimova made her silent film debut in 1916 in the filmed version of the play, which was produced by Lewis J. Selznick. She was paid $1,000 per day, and the film was a success. A young actor with a bit part in the movie was Richard Barthelmess, whose mother, Caroline W. Harris, had taught Nazimova English. Nazimova had encouraged him to try out for movies and he later became a star. In 1917, she negotiated a contract with Metro Pictures, a precursor to MGM, that included a weekly salary of $13,000. She moved from New York to Hollywood, where she made a number of highly successful films for Metro that earned her considerable money. 
She created and worked under Nazimova Productions from 1917 to 1921. She filled many roles in film production, outside of acting. She served as a director, producer, editor, lighting designer, and received credit for costume design for the film Revelation. She wrote screenplays under the pseudonym Peter M. Winters, and was a director for films credited to the name of her partner Charles Bryant. In her film adaptations of works by such notable writers as Oscar Wilde and Ibsen, she developed filmmaking techniques that were considered daring at the time. Her film projects, including &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1922), based on Ibsen, and &quot;Salomé&quot; (1923), based on Wilde&#x27;s play, were critical and commercial failures. &quot;Salomé&quot;, however, has become a cult classic, regarded as a feminist milestone in film. In 2000, the film was added to the National Film Registry. By 1925, she could no longer afford to invest in more films, and financial backers withdrew their support.

In 1927, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Left with few options, she gave up on the film industry, returning to perform on Broadway, notably starring as Natalya Petrovna in Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s 1930 New York production of Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; and an acclaimed performance as Mrs. Alving in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot;, which critic Pauline Kael described as the greatest performance she had ever seen on the American stage. In the early 1940s, she returned to films, playing Robert Taylor&#x27;s mother in &quot;Escape&quot; (1940) and Tyrone Power&#x27;s mother in &quot;Blood and Sand&quot; (1941). This late return to motion pictures fortunately preserves Nazimova and her art on sound film.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===

In 1899, she married Sergei Golovin, a fellow actor. From 1912 to 1925, Nazimova maintained a &quot;lavender marriage&quot; with Charles Bryant (1879–1948), a British-born actor. To bolster this arrangement with Bryant, Nazimova kept her marriage to Golovin secret from the press, her fans, and even her friends. In 1923, she arranged to divorce Golovin without traveling to the Soviet Union. Her divorce papers, which arrived in the United States that summer, stated that on May 11, 1923, the marriage of &quot;citizeness Leventon Alla Alexandrovna&quot; and Sergius Arkadyevitch Golovin, &quot;consummated between them in the City Church of Boruysk June 20, 1899&quot;, had been officially dissolved. A little over two years later, on November 16, 1925, Charles Bryant, then 43, surprised the press, Nazimova&#x27;s fans, and Nazimova herself by marrying Marjorie Gilhooley, 23, in Connecticut. When the press uncovered the fact that Charles had listed his current marital status as &quot;single&quot; on his marriage license, the revelation that the marriage between Alla and Charles had been a sham from the beginning embroiled Nazimova in a scandal that damaged her career.

===Relationships with women===
From 1917 to 1922, Nazimova wielded considerable influence and power in Hollywood. She helped start the careers of both of Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s wives, Jean Acker and Natacha Rambova. Although she was involved in an affair with Acker, it is debatable as to whether her connection with Rambova ever developed into a sexual affair.

Nevertheless, there were rumors that Nazimova and Rambova were involved in a lesbian affair (they are discussed at length in &quot;Dark Lover&quot;, Emily Leider&#x27;s biography of Rudolph Valentino) but those rumors never have been confirmed. She was very impressed by Rambova&#x27;s skills as an art director, and Rambova designed the innovative sets for Nazimova&#x27;s film productions of &quot;Camille&quot; and &quot;Salomé&quot;. The list of those Nazimova is confirmed to have been involved with romantically includes actress Eva Le Gallienne, film director Dorothy Arzner, writer Mercedes de Acosta, and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s niece Dolly Wilde.

Bridget Bate Tichenor, a Magic Realist artist and Surrealist painter, was rumored to be one of Nazimova&#x27;s favored lovers in Hollywood during 1940–1942. The two had been introduced by the poet and art collector Edward James, and according to Tichenor, their intimate relationship angered Nazimova&#x27;s longtime companion Glesca Marshall.It is believed that Nazimova coined the phrase sewing circle as code to refer to lesbian or bisexual actresses of her day who concealed their true sexuality.

Nazimova lived together with Glesca Marshall from 1929 until Nazimova&#x27;s death in 1945.

===Friends and relations===
Edith Luckett, a stage actress and the mother of future U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan, was a friend of Nazimova, having acted with her onstage. Edith married Kenneth Seymour Robbins, and following the birth of their daughter Nancy in 1921, Nazimova became her godmother. Nazimova continued to be friends with Edith and her second husband, neurosurgeon Loyal Davis, until her death. She was also the aunt of American film producer Val Lewton.

==Garden of Alla==

Nazimova&#x27;s private lifestyle gave rise to widespread rumors of outlandish and allegedly debauched parties at her mansion on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California, known as The Garden of Alla, which she leased in 1918 and bought outright the next year. Facing near-bankruptcy in 1926, she converted the 2.5-acre estate into a hotel by building 25 villas on the property. The Garden of Alla Hotel opened in January 1927. But Nazimova was ill-equipped to run a hotel and eventually sold it and returned to Broadway and theatrical tours. By 1930, the hotel had been purchased by Central Holding Corporation, which changed the name to the Garden of Allah Hotel. When Nazimova moved back to Hollywood in 1938, she rented Villa 24 at the hotel and lived there until her death.

==Death and memorials==
On July 13, 1945, Nazimova died of a coronary thrombosis, at age 66, in the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. Her ashes were interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Her contributions to the film industry have been recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Legacy==
Nazimova has been depicted a number of times in film and onstage. The first two were biographical films about Rudolph Valentino: &quot;The Legend of Valentino&quot; (1975), in which she was portrayed by Alicia Bond; and &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977), in which she was portrayed by Leslie Caron. She was featured in two 2013 silent films about Hollywood&#x27;s silent movie era: &quot;Return to Babylon,&quot; in which she was played by Laura Harring, and &quot;Silent Life&quot;, based on the life of Rudolph Valentino, where she was played by Sherilyn Fenn.

The character of Nazimova also appears in Dominick Argento&#x27;s opera &quot;Dream of Valentino&quot;, in which she also played the violin. Nazimova was also featured in make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Face Forward&quot;, in which he made up Isabella Rossellini to resemble her, particularly as posed in a certain photograph.

Actress Romy Nordlinger first portrayed Alla Nazimova in The Society for the Preservation of Theatrical History production of &quot;Stage Struck: From Kemble to Kate&quot; staged at the Snapple Theater Center in New York City in December 2013. In Fall 2016, PLACES, a multimedia solo show about Alla Nazimova, supported by the League of Professional Theatre Women&#x27;s Heritage Program, written and performed by Romy Nordlinger debuted at Playhouse Theatre for a limited run.

The Garden of Allah cabaret was an influential LGBTQ+ cabaret venue in the mid-20th century that took its name and inspiration from Nazimova&#x27;s original Garden of Alla.

Nazimova also appears in &quot;Medusa&#x27;s Web&quot;, a novel by fantasy-fiction writer Tim Powers.

<doc id="1080015" wikidata="Q1124012" url="?curid=1080015" title="Miscarriage of justice">
<text>A miscarriage of justice occurs when an unfair outcome occurs in a criminal or civil proceeding, such as the conviction and punishment of a person for a crime they did not commit. Miscarriages are also known as wrongful convictions. Innocent people have sometimes ended up in prison for years before their conviction has eventually been overturned. They may be exonerated if new evidence comes to light or it is determined that the police or prosecutor committed some kind of misconduct at the original trial. In some jurisdictions this leads to the payment of compensation.

Academic studies have found that the main factors contributing to miscarriages of justice are: eyewitness misidentification; faulty forensic analysis; false confessions by vulnerable suspects; perjury and lies stated by witnesses; misconduct by police, prosecutors or judges; and/or ineffective assistance of counsel (e.g., inadequate defense strategies by the defendant&#x27;s or respondent&#x27;s legal team). 

Some prosecutors&#x27; offices undertake conviction integrity reviews to prevent, identify, and correct wrongful convictions.

==Prevalence==
There are two main methods for estimating the prevalence of wrongful convictions.

=== Exoneration ===
The first is the number of exonerations where the guilty verdict has been vacated or annulled by a judge or higher court after new evidence has been brought forward proving the &quot;guilty&quot; person is, in fact, innocent. Since 1989, the Innocence Project has helped overturn 375 convictions of American prisoners with updated DNA evidence. However, DNA testing occurs in only 5 to 10% of all criminal cases, and exonerations achieved by the Innocence Project are limited to murder and rape cases. This raises the possibility that there may be many more wrongful convictions for which there is no evidence available to exonerate the defendant. Studies cited by the Innocence Project estimate that between 2.3% and 5% of all prisoners in the U.S. are innocent; however, a 2017 study looking at convictions in the state of Virginia during the 1970s and 1980s and matching them to later DNA analysis estimates a rate of wrongful conviction at 11.6%.

A 2014 study published in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; made a conservative estimate that 4.1% of inmates awaiting execution on death row in the United States are innocent.

=== Self-report ===
The second method for estimating wrongful convictions involves self-report. Researchers ask prisoners whether they have ever confessed to a crime which they did not commit. Self-report allows examination of any and all crimes where wrongful conviction may have occurred, not just murder and rape cases where DNA is available. Two Icelandic studies based on self-report conducted ten years apart found the rates of false confession to be 12.2% and 24.4%, respectively. These figures provide a proxy for miscarriages of justice because erroneous confessions are likely to lead to wrongful convictions. A 2021 Scottish study found the rate of self-reported false confessions among a group of inmates in one prison was 33.4%.

Up to 10,000 people may be wrongfully convicted of serious crimes in the United States each year. According to Professor Boaz Sangero of the College of Law and Business in Ramat Gan, most wrongful convictions in Israel relate to less serious crimes than major felonies such as rape and murder, as judicial systems are less careful in dealing with those cases.

== Contributing factors ==
Academics believe that six main factors contribute to miscarriages of justice. These include eyewitness misidentification, faulty forensic analysis, false confessions by vulnerable suspects, perjury and lies told by witnesses, misconduct by police, prosecutors or judges and inadequate defense strategies put forward by the defendant&#x27;s legal team.

=== Unreliability of eyewitness testimony ===
Eyewitness identifications are notoriously unreliable, contributing to 70% of wrongful convictions. Starting in the 1970s, psychologists studying memory formation and retention found that the way police lineups are conducted can alter an eyewitness&#x27;s memory of the suspect and this often leads to misidentification. Witnesses also have considerable difficulty making accurate identifications with suspects from different ethnic groups such that &quot;the rate of mistaken identification is significantly higher than most people tend to believe&quot;. Elizabeth Loftus, a leading researcher in the field, says memory is so unreliable &quot;the end result can be a highly confident witness testifying in a persuasive manner at trial about a detail that is completely false&quot;.

=== Forensic mistakes ===
==== Contamination ====
Wrongful convictions can also occur when items which become evidence at crime scenes become contaminated in the process of packaging, collection and transportation to a secured facility or laboratory. Contamination can be introduced unintentionally by material that was not present when the crime was committed by anyone entering the crime scene after the event - by uninvolved witnesses who may become suspects, and by emergency responders, fire fighters, police officers and crime scene investigators themselves. If proper protocols are not followed, evidence can also be contaminated when it is being analyzed or stored. A miscarriage of justice can occur when procedures to prevent contamination are not carried out carefully and accurately.

==== Faulty analysis ====
The Innocence Project says 44% of wrongful convictions are the result of faulty forensic analysis. This occurs when forensic experts inadvertently or deliberately misrepresent the significance, validity or reliability of scientific evidence. Over the years, misrepresentations have been made in the arenas of serological analysis, microscopic hair comparison, and the analysis of bite marks, shoe prints, soil, fiber, and fingerprints.

==== Overconfident experts ====
Overly confident testimony by expert witnesses can also lead to miscarriages of justice. The credibility of expert witnesses depends on numerous factors - in particular, their credentials, personal likability and self-confidence which all impact on how believable they are. The confidence with which experts present their evidence has also been noted to influence jurors, who tend to assume that a witness who is anxious or nervous is lying. The manner in which experts testify may have a greater impact on judges and lawyers who prefer experts who provide clear, unequivocal conclusions.

The credentials and reputation of the expert also have a significant impact on juries. For example, Charles Smith was head of the Ontario Pediatric Forensic Pathology Unit from 1982 and the most highly regarded specialist in his field. His testimony led to the convictions of thirteen women whose children died in unexplained circumstance before it came to light that he had &quot;a thing against people who hurt children&quot;, and &quot;was on a crusade and acted more like a prosecutor&quot; than a pathologist. An inquiry into his conduct concluded in October 2008 that Smith &quot;actively misled&quot; his superiors, &quot;made false and misleading statements&quot; in court and exaggerated his expertise in trials.

=== False confessions ===

The possibility that innocent people would admit to a crime they did not commit seems unlikely - and yet this occurs so often, the Innocence Project found false confessions contribute to approximately 25% of wrongful convictions in murder and rape cases. Certain suspects are more vulnerable to making a false confession under police pressure. This includes individuals who are intellectually impaired, and those who suffer from mental illness. Saul Kassin, a leading expert on false confessions, says that young people are also particularly vulnerable to confessing, especially when stressed, tired, or traumatized.

==== Coercive interrogation techniques ====

Police often use coercive manipulation techniques when conducting interrogations in hopes of obtaining a confession. In the United States, one of these is known as the Reid Technique after the officer who developed it, John Reid. Introduced in the 1940s and 50s, the strategy relies on deception, coercion and aggressive confrontation to secure confessions. It became the leading interrogation method used by law enforcement throughout the United States and has led to many confessions by innocent people. As of 2014, this technique was still popular with police interrogators even though the strategy produces less information from suspects, provides fewer true confessions and more false confessions than less confrontational interviewing techniques.

=== Perjury and false accusations ===
Witnesses in police investigations may lie for a variety of reasons including: personal ill-will towards the defendant, the desire to be paid, the desire to get a deal from prosecutors or police, or an effort to deflect attention from a person&#x27;s own involvement in a crime. An innocent person is more likely to be convicted when one or more witnesses have an incentive to testify, and those incentives are not disclosed to the jury. According to the National Registry of Exonerations, 57% of cases where the convicted person was eventually exonerated involves perjury or false accusations.

=== Prosecutorial misconduct ===

This occurs in numerous ways including the concealment or destruction of exculpatory evidence; the failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defence; the failure to reveal that certain witnesses have been paid to testify; and the planting of incriminating evidence. An Innocence Project study found that 25% of DNA exonerations involved testimony that was known to be false by the police and another 11% involved the undisclosed use of coerced witness testimony. In other words, over one third of these wrongful convictions involved prosecutorial misconduct.

==== Biased justice ====

Confirmation bias is a psychological phenomenon whereby people tend to seek and interpret information in ways that support existing beliefs. Two inter-related mechanisms tend to operate: it begins with a biased interpretation of whatever information is available, followed by selectively searching for information which supports this interpretation. In police investigations, this comes into play when detectives identify a suspect early in an investigation, come to believe he or she is guilty, and then ignore or downplay other evidence that points to someone else or doesn&#x27;t fit their hypothesis about what occurred.

A number of factors contribute to this process. First, police officers often have heavy workloads and, in high-profile cases, often come under considerable pressure to catch the perpetrator as soon as possible. This may encourage a rush to judgement - in a process described by psychologists as involving a high need for cognitive closure (NFC) - the desire for a clear-cut solution which avoids confusion and ambiguity.

Second, after spending considerable time and resources trying to build a case against a particular suspect, it becomes difficult for police to admit they may be going down the wrong track. The embarrassment and loss of prestige that follows from admitting erroneous decisions may motivate investigators to continue down a chosen path and disregard evidence that points in a different direction.

Third, criminal investigations are generally theory-driven activities. Investigators tend to evaluate evidence based on their preliminary theories or hypotheses about how, and by whom, a crime was committed. Because of the pressures described above, such hypotheses are sometimes based on the expectations and preconceptions of the investigators rather than on solid facts. A study in the Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling found that &quot;criminal investigations which aim at generating evidence confirming an ill-founded hypothesis pose serious threats both to the security of innocent citizens and to the effectiveness of the law-enforcement system&quot;.

==== Noble cause corruption ====

Police may become convinced a particular suspect is guilty but not have sufficient evidence to prove it. Sometimes they may plant evidence in order to secure a conviction because they believe it is in the public interest, or that there is a greater good, in convicting a particular person. In other words, they believe that the ends (or the outcome) justifies the means. This is known as noble cause corruption.

==== Plea bargaining ====

Another technique used by police is plea bargaining whereby the prosecutor provides a concession to the defendant in exchange for a plea of guilt. This generally occurs when the defendant pleads guilty to a less serious charge, or to one of several charges, in return for the dismissal of the main charge; or it may mean that the defendant pleads guilty to the main charge in return for a more lenient sentence.

== Compensation for wrongful conviction ==

Article 14(6) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) states that when a miscarriage of justice has occurred and the defendant&#x27;s conviction has been reversed or they have been pardoned, &quot;the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to law&quot;. The right to compensation is also authorized by Article 3 of Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Article 10 of the American Convention on Human Rights.

Many jurisdictions worldwide provide some kind of remedy for those wrongfully convicted. As victims often face a variety of severe negative psychological, social, and financial consequences, they may be offered an opportunity to seek financial compensation. However, most jurisdictions require a separate inquiry post-exoneration to determine the degree of compensation the victim is entitled to. While most societies agree that a person who did not commit a crime and served a long imprisonment is entitled to significant compensation, it may not be justified, for example, to award compensation to a person who is still believed to have committed a &quot;prima facie&quot; criminal act but whose conviction was overturned due to technicalities.

Four broad approaches allow for the payment of compensation following a miscarriage of justice: tort liability in common law; claims for a breach of constitutional or human rights; statutory relief where specific legislation exists to compensate individuals who are wrongfully convicted; and non-statutory relief by way of ex-gratia schemes based on the largesse of the government. 

In a study of different approaches to the payment of compensation in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, only the US and the UK have statutory schemes in place. In the United States, the federal government, the District of Columbia, and 38 states have such legislation on their statutes. Twelve states have no laws requiring compensation to be paid. However, each state differs widely in regard to eligibility requirements, maximum payments, issues concerning factual innocence, the burden of proof, the behavior of the claimant which contributed to the (now overturned) conviction, and the claimant&#x27;s prior criminal history. In some states, statutes of limitations also applies.

The significant benefits of statutory schemes is that they provide money and services in compensation to individuals who have been wrongfully convicted without regard to fault or blame; they do not require claimants to prove how the prosecution or police committed their mistakes.

==Implications==
The concept of miscarriage of justice has important implications for standard of review, in that an appellate court will often only exercise its discretion to correct a plain error when a miscarriage of justice (or &quot;manifest injustice&quot;) would otherwise occur.

The risk of miscarriages of justice is often cited as a cause to eliminate the death penalty. When condemned persons are executed before they are determined to have been wrongly convicted, the effect of that miscarriage of justice is irreversible. Wrongly executed people nevertheless occasionally receive posthumous pardons—which essentially void the conviction—or have their convictions quashed.

Even when a wrongly convicted person is not executed, years in prison can have a substantial, irreversible effect on the person and their family. The risk of miscarriage of justice is therefore also an argument against long sentences, like a life sentence, and cruel prison conditions.

==Consequences==
Wrongful convictions appear at first to be &quot;rightful&quot; arrests and subsequent convictions, and also include a public statement about a particular crime having occurred, as well as a particular individual or individuals having committed that crime. If the conviction turns out to be a miscarriage of justice, then one or both of these statements is ultimately deemed to be false. In cases where a large-scale audience is unknowingly witness to a miscarriage of justice, the news-consuming public may develop false beliefs about the nature of crime itself. It may also cause the public to falsely believe that certain types of crime exist, or that certain types of people tend to commit these crimes, or that certain crimes are more commonly prevalent than they actually are. Thus, wrongful convictions can ultimately mold a society&#x27;s popular beliefs about crime. Because our understanding of crime is socially constructed, it has been shaped by many factors other than its actual occurrence.

Mass media may also be faulted for distorting the public perception of crime by over-representing certain races and genders as criminals and victims, and for highlighting more sensational and invigorating types of crimes as being more newsworthy. The way a media presents crime-related issues may have an influence not only on a society&#x27;s fear of crime but also on its beliefs about the causes of criminal behavior and desirability of one or another approach to crime control. Ultimately, this may have a significant impact on critical public beliefs about emerging forms of crime such as cybercrime, global crime, and terrorism.

Some wrongfully sanctioned people join organizations like the Innocence Project and Witness to Innocence to publicly share their stories, as a way to counteract these media distortions and to advocate for various types of criminal justice reform.

There are unfavorable psychological effects to those who were wrongfully sanctioned, even in the absence of any public knowledge. In an experiment, participants significantly reduced their pro-social behavior after being wrongfully sanctioned. As a consequence there were negative effects for the entire group. The extent of wrongful sanctions varies between societies.

When a crime occurs and the wrong person is convicted for it, the actual perpetrator goes free and often goes on to commit additional crimes, including hundreds of cases of violent crime. A 2019 study estimated that &quot;the wrong‐person wrongful convictions that occur annually [in the United States] may lead to more than 41,000 additional crimes&quot;.

==By country==
===Canada===
A series of miscarriages of justice in Canada have led to reforms of the country&#x27;s criminal justice system. In 1959, 14-year-old Steven Truscott was convicted of raping and murdering a 12-year-old girl. Originally sentenced to death by hanging, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released on parole in 1969, and was freed from his parole restrictions in 1974. In 2007, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned Truscott&#x27;s conviction, based on a reexamination of forensic evidence. The government of Ontario awarded him $6.5 million in compensation.

In 1972, Donald Marshall Jr., a Mi&#x27;kmaq man, was wrongly convicted of murder. Marshall spent 11 years in jail before being acquitted in 1983. The case led to questions about the fairness of the Canadian justice system, especially given that Marshall was an Aboriginal: as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation put it, &quot;The name Donald Marshall is almost synonymous with &#x27;wrongful conviction&#x27; and the fight for native justice in Canada.&quot; Marshall received a lifetime pension of $1.5 million in compensation and his conviction resulted in changes to the Canada Evidence Act so that any evidence obtained by the prosecution must be presented to the defense on disclosure. 

In 1970, David Milgaard was wrongfully convicted for the rape and murder of Gail Miller. He was released in 1992 and compensated $10 million by the Saskatchewan government after having spent 23 years in prison. After being tied to it by DNA evidence, serial rapist Larry Fisher was convicted of the murder in 1999.

In 1992, Guy Paul Morin was convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of a 9-year-old girl and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1995, new testing of DNA evidence showed Morin could not have been the murderer, and the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned his conviction. The case has been described as &quot;a compendium of official error—from inaccurate eyewitness testimony and police tunnel vision, to scientific bungling and the suppression of evidence.&quot; Morin received $1.25 million in compensation from the Ontario government.

===China===
A series of wrongful convictions were uncovered in the 2010s which had a large impact on the judicial system and undermined public trust in the Chinese justice system. Zhao Zuohai was one of the wrongful convictions, who had to serve 10 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. The alleged victim that he murdered had returned home and he was released from prison. While he was being released from prison he shared some chilling news. Zuohai shared with the police officers and officials that while he was being taken into custody he repeatedly experienced torture because they were trying to extract a confession from Zuohai.

===Italy===
Enzo Tortora, a TV host on national RAI television, was accused of being a member of the Camorra and drug trafficking. He was arrested in 1983, and sentenced to ten years in jail in 1985, but acquitted of all charges on appeal in 1986.

===Netherlands===
In response to two overturned cases, the Schiedammerpark murder case and the Putten murder, the Netherlands created the &quot;Posthumus I committee&quot; which analyzed what had gone wrong in the Schiedammerpark murder case. The committee concluded that confirmation bias led the police to ignore and misinterpret scientific evidence, specifically DNA. Subsequently, the Posthumus II committee investigated whether injustice occurred in similar cases. The committee received 25 applications from concerned and involved scientists and selected three for further investigation: the Lucia de Berk case, the Ina Post case, and the Enschede incest case. In those three cases, independent researchers (professors Wagenaar, van Koppen, Israëls, Crombag, and Derksen) concluded that confirmation bias and misuse of complex scientific evidence led to miscarriages of justice.

===New Zealand===
In the last ten years (as at 2023), nearly 900 New Zealanders have had their convictions overturned. Compensation for wrongful convictions, wrongful detainment, or false imprisonment is not guaranteed under New Zealand law and only a small fraction of vicitms are ever compensated. A wait time from arrest to trial of 18 months to 4+ years is common in New Zealand, which means victims of miscarriages of justice can lose years of their lives to systemic failures in New Zealand&#x27;s justice system.

===Spain===
The Constitution of Spain guarantees compensation in cases of miscarriage of justice. This includes those who have been acquitted of their charges or if their case has been dismissed.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom a jailed person, whose conviction is quashed, might be paid compensation for the time they were incarcerated. This is currently limited by statute to a maximum sum of £1,000,000 for those who have been incarcerated for more than ten years and £500,000 for any other cases, Between 2007 and 2023 there could be deductions for the cost of food and accommodation during that time. See also Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom.

Richard Foster, the Chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), reported in October 2018 that the single biggest cause of miscarriage of justice was the failure to disclose vital evidence.

A major factor leading to the abolition of capital punishment for murder in the United Kingdom was the case of Timothy Evans, who was executed in 1950 after being wrongfully convicted of a murder that had been committed by his neighbour.

====England, Wales and Northern Ireland====

Until 2005, the parole system assumed all convicted persons were guilty, and poorly handled those who were not. To be paroled, a convicted person had to sign a document in which, among other things, they confessed to the crime for which they were convicted. Someone who refused to sign this declaration spent longer in jail than someone who signed it. Some wrongly convicted people, such as the Birmingham Six, were refused parole for this reason. In 2005 the system changed, and began to parole prisoners who never admitted guilt.

English law has no official means of correcting a &quot;perverse&quot; verdict (conviction of a defendant on the basis of insufficient evidence). Appeals are based exclusively on new evidence or errors by the judge or prosecution (but not the defence), or jury irregularities. A reversal occurred, however, in the 1930s when William Herbert Wallace was exonerated of the murder of his wife. There is no right to a trial &quot;without&quot; jury (except during the troubles in Northern Ireland or in the case where there is a significant risk of jury-tampering, such as organised crime cases, when a judge or judges presided without a jury).

During the early 1990s, a series of high-profile cases turned out to be miscarriages of justice. Many resulted from police fabricating evidence to convict people they thought were guilty, or simply to get a high conviction rate. The West Midlands Serious Crime Squad became notorious for such practices, and was disbanded in 1989. In 1997 the Criminal Cases Review Commission was established specifically to examine possible miscarriages of justice. However, it still requires either strong new evidence of innocence, or new proof of a legal error by the judge or prosecution. For example, merely insisting on one&#x27;s innocence, asserting the jury made an error, or stating there was not enough evidence to prove guilt, is not enough. It is not possible to question the jury&#x27;s decision or query on what matters it was based. The waiting list for cases to be considered for review is at least two years on average.

In 2002, the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal made an exception to who could avail of the right to a fair trial in &quot;R v Walsh&quot;: &quot;... if a defendant has been denied a fair trial it will almost be inevitable that the conviction will be regarded unsafe, the present case in our view constitutes an exception to the general rule. ... the conviction is to be regarded as safe, even if a breach of Article 6(1) were held to have occurred in the present case.&quot; (See Christy Walsh (Case).)

====Scotland====
The Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1927 (17 &amp; 18 Geo. 5. c. 26) increased the jurisdiction of the Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal following the miscarriage of justice surrounding the Trial of Oscar Slater.

Reflecting Scotland&#x27;s own legal system, which differs from that of the rest of the United Kingdom, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) was established in April 1999. All cases accepted by the SCCRC are subjected to a robust and thoroughly impartial review before a decision on whether or not to refer to the High Court of Justiciary is taken.

===United States===

In June 2012, the National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project of the University of Michigan Law School and Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, initially reported 873 individual exonerations in the U.S. from January 1989 through February 2012; the report called this number &quot;tiny&quot; in a country with 2.3 million people in prisons and jails, but asserted that there are far more false convictions than exonerations. By 2015, the number of individual exonerations was reported as 1,733, with 2015 having the highest annual number of exonerations since 1989. By 2019, the number had risen to 1,934 individuals. 20 individuals have been exonerated while on death row due to DNA evidence.

According to a 2020 report by the National Registry of Exonerations, official misconduct contributed to 54% of all wrong convictions. The study only counted misconduct when it directly contributed to the convictions, such as the generation of false evidence or concealment of evidence of innocence.

At least 21 states in the U.S. do not offer compensation for wrongful imprisonment.

The Innocence Project works to exonerate people in the United States who have been wrongfully convicted of crime. It has estimated that 1 percent of all U.S. prisoners are innocent. With the number of incarcerated Americans being approximately 2.4 million, by that estimate as many as 20,000 people may be incarcerated as a result of wrongful conviction.

Research into the issue of wrongful convictions have led to the use of methods to avoid wrongful convictions, such as double-blind eyewitness identification. Leading causes of wrongful convictions in the United States include snitches and unscientific forensics.
Other causes include police and prosecutorial misconduct.

Race and systemic racism have been found to be a factor in wrongful convictions; a report by the National Registry of Exonerations found that, as of August 2022, African Americans make up 13.6% of the U.S. population, but 53% of exonerations, and that they were seven times more likely to be falsely convicted compared to White Americans.

Leo Frank, who was kidnapped from prison by an antisemitic mob and lynched in 1915, was pardoned by the state of Georgia in 1986; Fulton County&#x27;s new Conviction Integrity Unit opened a re-investigation of the case in 2019. Theater critic Jesse Green referred to 2023&#x27;s Tony-winning Broadway production of &quot;Parade&quot; as focusing on &quot;the marriage instead of the miscarriage of justice&quot;.

In 2023, Glynn Simmons was released from prison after 48 years of prison. His imprisonment after wrongful conviction is believed to be the longest in American history.

According to Judge Rakoff (p. 85), &quot;forensic techniques that in their origin were simply viewed as aids to police investigations have taken on an importance in the criminal justice system that they frequently cannot support. Their results are portrayed... as possessing a degree of validity and reliability that they simply do not have.&quot; Rakoff commends (p. 85) the U.S. National Academy of Sciences recommendation to &quot;creat[e] an independent National Institute of Forensic Science to do the basic testing and promulgate the basic standards that would make forensic science much more genuinely scientific.&quot;

<text>A hunting sword is a type of single-handed short sword that dates back to the 12th century, but was primarily used during hunting parties in Europe from the 17th to the 19th century. A hunting sword usually has a straight, single-edged, pointed blade typically no more than long. This sword was used for finishing off game in lieu of using and wasting further shot. Adopted by many Europeans, and in past centuries sometimes worn by military officers as a badge of rank, hunting swords display great variety in design. Some hilts featured a thin knuckle-bow to protect the fingers. Others sported a serrated saw edge on the back of the blade. Still others had small matchlock pistols built into the hilt that originated in the early 18th century, with deep firing grooves cut into the fuller of the blade.

<doc id="1080024" wikidata="Q5179474" url="?curid=1080024" title="Cowards Bend the Knee">
<text>Cowards Bend the Knee (also known as The Blue Hands) is a 2003 film by Guy Maddin. Maddin directed &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; while in pre-production on &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot;, shooting entirely on Super-8mm film with a budget of $30,000.

The feature film was initially developed as a series of ten short films, commissioned as part of an installation art project by Toronto art gallery The Power Plant (curated by Philip Monk). &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; is the first in Maddin&#x27;s &quot;autobiographical &#x27;Me Trilogy&#x27;&quot; of feature films starring protagonists named &quot;Guy Maddin,&quot; the second being &quot;Brand Upon the Brain!&quot; (2006) and the third &quot;My Winnipeg&quot; (2007).

Maddin based the film&#x27;s premise loosely on the story &quot;The Hands of Ida&quot; and Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Medea&quot;, although Maddin also claims that the film can be viewed as an autobiography (although the events of his life are not being represented so much as the events of his inner life).

== Plot ==
&quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; is set in a vague time period that is stated in the published script and on the DVD commentary as the 1930s, although certain of the film&#x27;s events (e.g., the Winnipeg Maroons winning the Allan Cup) did not occur until the 1960s. Guy Maddin (played by Darcy Fehr), star hockey player for the Winnipeg Maroons, is told by his father Maddin Sr (Victor Cowie), the team&#x27;s announcer, to visit his mother in the hospital since she is gravely ill. Maddin instead takes his girlfriend Veronica (Amy Stewart) to get an illegal abortion at the home/beauty salon/bordello of Liliom (Tara Birtwistle). During the operation, Guy more or less forgets about Veronica and ends up leaving with Liliom&#x27;s alluring daughter Meta (Melissa Dionisio). Veronica dies as a result of the botched abortion and perhaps despair at her abandonment.

Meta reveals that her father, Chas, was murdered by Liliom with help from the police captain Shaky, who also plays hockey with Guy. Chas&#x27; hands, stained blue from hair dye, were severed during the murder and Meta keeps them with her in a jar. She rejects Guy&#x27;s sexual advances, saying that she won&#x27;t be his until he murders Liliom and Shaky to revenge Chas. The hockey team&#x27;s doctor, Dr. Fusi (Louis Negin) agrees to sever Guy&#x27;s hands and suture Chas&#x27; hands in their place.

However, while Guy is sedated and Meta is gone, Dr. Fusi just throws the hands away and paints Guy&#x27;s own hands blue. Believing himself possessed by Chas&#x27; murderous hands, Guy sets out to kill Liliom but instead ends up trying to seduce her and eventually &quot;fists&quot; her in the beauty salon. Veronica&#x27;s ghost has meanwhile risen and takes a job at the beauty salon, as does Guy. Guy becomes infatuated with Veronica&#x27;s ghost, not recognizing her as the girlfriend he abandoned to die on the operating table (he has forgotten Veronica completely by this point).

Tormented, Guy discovers a wax museum that has been hidden and forgotten in the rafters of the Winnipeg hockey arena. The museum features wax sculptures of famous Winnipeg Maroons, including Chas. Meta continues to coerce Guy to carry out her revenge plans. Guy ends up murdering Shaky during a hockey game and, feeling guilty, attempts to confess his crime to the policeman Mo, but Mo refuses to arrest Guy and tries to get him to stop confessing. Guy then strangles Mo to death in the middle of the police station but none of the other officers notice.

Veronica&#x27;s ghost has meanwhile begun dating Guy&#x27;s father, Maddin Sr. after Guy&#x27;s mother dies, unvisited. Guy is now involved with both Meta and Liliom (who he&#x27;s promised Meta he will kill) while in love with the ghost of his ex-girlfriend Veronica, whose death he is somewhat responsible for and who is now involved with his own father. The pressure of the situation, in addition to the delusion that he is possessed by the murderous hands of Chas, drives Guy to finally strangle Liliom when she tries to stop Veronica&#x27;s ghost from having a second abortion of unknown origin (presumably his father&#x27;s child and thus his sibling, or perhaps his child needing to be aborted a second time). Meta by this time has soured on Guy and demands that Fusi returns her father&#x27;s hands to her. Dr. Fusi then chloroforms Guy again and amputates his blue-painted hands.

Handless, Guy heads to the hockey arena and suits up for the big game, taping his hockey gloves over his fresh stumps. Guy heads to the urinal pre-game, but finds peeing a difficult tasks with no hands. At the urinal, he encounters his father, Maddin Sr., and sees that his father&#x27;s penis is exceptionally large (much larger than his own). During the game, Maddin Sr. announces while stroking a block of ice carved into the shape of a woman&#x27;s breast. Veronica&#x27;s ghost, aroused by this, walks across the catwalk over the arena&#x27;s ice towards the radio booth. Guy also climbs to the top of the arena and heads into the wax museum, where tarot cards predict &quot;a mysterious apocalypse.&quot; Maddin Sr. and Veronica&#x27;s ghost enter to announce that Guy&#x27;s old girlfriend will be his new mother. The anguished Guy invokes the wax heroes of hockey old to aid him, and they in fact do awaken, having revealed themselves not to be wax heroes at all but cowards who have chosen immobility as an escape from life.

Guy and the hockey immortals pursue Maddin Sr. and Veronica&#x27;s ghost out of the room and onto the catwalk. Meta sees her father Chas among the wax immortals and rushes to meet him. She attempts to reenact the childhood game that Chas and Meta used to play — she swooned and he caught her — but since Chas no longer has hands, he cannot catch her and she falls to her death. Guy then joins the wax immortals in the museum, in cowardly retreat.

=== Home video ===
&quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; was released to home video on DVD by Zeitgeist Video in 2005. &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; is also included on the DVD boxed set &quot;The Quintessential Guy Maddin: 5 Films from the Heart of Winnipeg,&quot; released by Zeitgeist Video, alongside &quot;Archangel&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Twilight of the Ice Nymphs&quot;, and &quot;Careful&quot;.

=== Book ===
Guy Maddin wrote a lengthy treatment for the feature film &quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot;, which he published as a book through The Power Plant gallery.

The book contains a foreword by Wayne Baerwaldt (then-Director of The Power Plant) and an introduction by Philip Monk, who also edited the book and curated Maddin&#x27;s installation. The main text is followed by an interview with Guy Maddin conducted by Robert Enright. The book also contains stills from the film and a list of credits for the film.

Most of the text is Maddin&#x27;s treatment for the film, which follows the same plot. In the words of Baerwaldt, the story is a fictional &quot;autobiography [that] features a diabolical plot surrounding a coward on a mission [named Guy Maddin] that resembles a cycle of dark spectacles dressed up as, among other things, lewd seduction, Canadian hockey, murder, amputations, hair design, general mayhem, fetish attractions and heartfelt loss.&quot;

In the interview with Enright, Maddin notes that the book&#x27;s genesis began with Maddin&#x27;s intention to clarify the narrative of his films, since &quot;it is a source of continuing frustration that people would say --- and it was always a compliment --- we really like your films, they&#x27;re so non-narrative. So I thought, damnit, I&#x27;m going to get a story that people are going to recognize, something that has legs. I started reading Greek tragedy, &quot;Electra, Medea&quot; and stuff like that, and basically I just took some premises from these super-durable stories. The things I end up layering around these rock-solid premises are invariably pure autobiography [. . .] once I slipped away what little remained of Euripides, what was left was some core sample of me.&quot;

Maddin&#x27;s book treatment is written in a highly literary fashion that is not typical of screen treatments, so that the text reads like a literary work rather than a blueprint for the film: &quot;It is the night before the [Winnipeg] Maroons&#x27; first game against the Soviets. Meta and Guy lie in bed, in the midst of a particularly spectacular recital of what could be called THE LIMBO-DANCE OF SELF-PITY --- a verbal choreography performed by lovers who manipulate each other through complicated displays of insincere self-loathing. Participants enter the Limbo in hopes of restructuring the unspoken terms of their relationship.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Cowards Bend the Knee&quot; received very positive reviews, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reporting a 95% approval rating based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from film critics, posts a rating score of 82 based on 10 reviews.

Critic J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called the film &quot;Maddin&#x27;s masterpiece,&quot; noting that the film &quot;not only plays like a dream but feels like one.&quot;

<doc id="1080033" wikidata="Q1161808" url="?curid=1080033" title="Daniel Mongiardo">
<text>Frank Daniel Mongiardo (born July 4, 1960) is an American physician and politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Mongiardo is a Democrat and was the 54th lieutenant governor of Kentucky from 2007 until 2011. He was a member of the Kentucky State Senate from 2001 to 2007. He also ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, narrowly losing in the general election to Jim Bunning, and again in 2010, losing in the primary election to Jack Conway.

==Personal life and career==
Mongiardo was born to Italian immigrants in Hazard, Kentucky. His father, Jimmy, owned a whiskey store and coin laundry, for many years, before retiring, and his mother, Katherine, died in 1988 of colon cancer. Mongiardo attended Transylvania University and received his medical degree at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in 1986. From 1986 to 2000, Mongiardo worked as an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, performing his residency in Lexington. Mongiardo helped open a free health clinic and became chief of staff at the Hazard Appalachian Hospital. He entered politics in 2000 and was elected to the state senate, after defeating incumbent Glenn Freeman in an expensive and bitter Democratic primary with 49.1 percent of the vote and then winning the general election with 70 percent of the vote.

Mongiardo was reelected to a redrawn district in 2002 that covers Bell, Harlan, Leslie, and Perry counties with 65.6 percent of the vote. In this campaign, Mongiardo, argued his opponent, Johnnie Turner, had used images of Mohamed Atta in a television advertisement to compare Atta to him. In the Kentucky Senate, Mongiardo worked to bring water projects to his district, pressed for legislation to establish an electronic medical network, and voted against a constitutional amendment that would allow the legislature to limit the payment of punitive damages in medical malpractice cases. Mongiardo continued his private practice and married Allison Patrick in Covington, Kentucky in 2008. Their first child, Kathryn, was born on December 22, 2009, their second child, Cannon, was born on September 28, 2011, and third child, Barron, was born August 30, 2014.

==2004 U.S. Senate race==

Mongiardo ran in the 2004 U.S. Senate election to unseat incumbent first-term Senator Jim Bunning, a former Major League Baseball player. He won the primary election with 64.9 percent of the vote and made health care his top campaign priority. Although early polls showed Mongiardo at a significant disadvantage against Bunning, who had more name recognition and campaign funds, Mongiardo was able to make large gains, on account of several missteps committed by Bunning and other Kentucky Republicans, including Bunning&#x27;s admission not to have read newspapers articles on the Iraq war and claims made against Mongiardo regarding his staff&#x27;s violence against Bunning&#x27;s wife, his sexual preference, and his physical likeness to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s sons, for the last of which Bunning later apologized. Mongiardo responded with statements about his co-sponsorship of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in Kentucky and his intent to vote in favor of a Federal Marriage Amendment, and he argued that Bunning was removed from the interests of families. Mongiardo gained support from national Democratic organizations, but he lost the bitterly contested election, 49.3 percent to 50.7 percent. Mongiardo was ahead with as much as 80 percent of the returns in. However, the western portion of the state broke strongly for Bunning, providing the ultimate margin of victory.

==Lieutenant governor==
Former Kentucky Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear chose Mongiardo as his running mate for the 2007 gubernatorial election in Kentucky. They won the Democratic primary election on May 22, 2007, with 41 percent of the vote against several tickets, including Bruce Lunsford and Greg Stumbo, and Steve Henry and Renee True, and with enough votes to avoid a June runoff. Beshear-Mongiardo were elected over incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher on November 6, 2007, winning with 58.7 percent of the state vote. Mongiardo did not risk losing his seat in the state senate, because Kentucky holds its constitutional officer elections in odd years.

In September 2008, Mongiardo claimed that some rural voters would not support Barack Obama, because of unfamiliarity with Obama, ignorance, or race. Mongiardo had endorsed Obama, who had supported him in the 2004 U.S. Senate election. Republican Kentucky State Senate President David L. Williams demanded Mongiardo apologize. Mongiardo argued that if Williams suggested racism was not an issue, he was &quot;out of touch.&quot;

==2010 U.S. Senate race==

In January 2009, Mongiardo announced that he would be running for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by incumbent Jim Bunning. Mongiardo called for Bunning to withdraw from reelection, questioning his ability to represent the state, because of controversial statements made about the health of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Bunning&#x27;s reportedly strained relationship with other Republican senators. Bunning later announced that he would not run in 2010. Mongiardo was narrowly defeated in the Democratic Primary by the Attorney General of Kentucky Jack Conway.

Under a bill changing the selection process of candidates for Lieutenant Governor, which was proposed to the Kentucky House of Representatives, Mongiardo could seek reelection as Lieutenant Governor, even if he lost the Democratic primary to the U.S. Senate in 2010. Governor Steve Beshear, however, privately indicated his desire to assemble his 2011 reelection team prior to the conclusion of the 2010 election cycle. On July 19, 2009, Beshear named Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson as his running mate in for reelection in 2011.

On January 20, 2009, Mongiardo appeared on the Tonight Show, where he lost an inaugural trivia contest to Hooters girls.

<text>Bialy, originally from the city of Białystok in Poland, is a traditional bread roll in Polish Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine.

==Overview==

A chewy yeast roll bearing similarity to the bagel, the bialy has a diameter of up to . Unlike a bagel, which is boiled before baking, a bialy is simply baked, and instead of a hole in the middle it has a depression. It is also usually covered with onion flakes. Before baking, the depression is sometimes filled with diced onion and other ingredients, such as garlic, poppy seeds, or bread crumbs.

==Variations==
The bialy was brought to the United States by Polish Jewish immigrants in the late 1800s, and became a staple of Jewish bakeries in the Northeastern United States. Bialys became a popular breakfast bread in New York City and its suburbs, especially among American Jews. Bialys are often made by bagel bakeries, but the bialy has failed to reach mainstream popularity. Preparing bialys in the traditional manner is time-consuming, so many bakeries now use dough mixers, as is common in bagel making. Bialys are considered an iconic New York City food, and can be difficult to find outside that area, but frozen bialys are sold under a number of brand names, such as &quot;Ray’s New York&quot;, in supermarkets across the US.

== In popular culture ==
Former &quot;New York Times&quot; food writer Mimi Sheraton wrote &quot;The Bialy Eaters: The Story of a Bread and a Lost World&quot;, a 2000 book dedicated to the bialy and its role as a symbol of the Jewish heritage of Białystok.

<doc id="1080036" wikidata="Q5321909" url="?curid=1080036" title="E. H. W. Meyerstein">
<text>Edward Harry William Meyerstein (11 August 1889 – 12 September 1952) was an English writer and scholar. He wrote poetry and short stories, and a &quot;Life of Thomas Chatterton&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Meyerstein was born in Hampstead, London, the only son of Edward William Meyerstein and his wife Jessy Louise Solomon. His father was a merchant and stockbroker who was generous benefactor to the Royal Free Hospital became High Sheriff of Kent and was knighted in 1938. Meyerstein was educated at Holly Hill, Hampstead, and then went to board at St Cyprian&#x27;s School, Eastbourne. At St Cyprian&#x27;s, he met the future painter Cedric Morris, started collecting manuscripts from local bookshops and won the Harrow History Prize. With this under his belt, his mother then sent him to Harrow. Brought up as a Protestant, he was baptised before going to Harrow, with George Adolphus Storey the painter as his godfather. After Harrow, he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he had many friends including Wilfred Rowland Childe and John Wain. His verse was published in &quot;Oxford Poetry 1910–13&quot; and later volumes.

==Career==
After Oxford, Meyerstein spent some time in Germany before starting work in the manuscript room of the British Museum. In the autumn of 1914 he enlisted in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, but was discharged as &quot;not likely to become an efficient soldier&quot;.

He returned to the British Museum where he stayed until Armistice Day 1918. He was becoming increasingly discontented with regular work, but a visit from his mother became the final straw and he resigned. Here he based his short novel &quot;Bollond&quot;, which although written in 1920 remained unpublished until 1958, after his death. It is the story of a young man&#x27;s misadventures adrift in the West End of London in the last months of the War. Reginald Bollond, the central character, unwittingly attracts the attention of a series of homosexuals, including a cocaine dealer who wants to set him up as a rent boy. Meyerstein decided to develop his writing and his collections and his interests in the arts. He became a Fellow of Magdalen College and considered himself a man of letters thereafter. Apart from occasional holidays in the English countryside and in Europe, he spent most of his life in his rooms at Greys Inn Place. He wrote &quot;A Life of Thomas Chatterton&quot; – the promising poet who committed suicide at an early age – in 1930 and produced various works of poetry which were published in collections. Occasional music criticism also appeared under his name in the journal &quot;Music Survey&quot;.

==Legacies==
He made important bequests to his college and the British Library (including part of a Mozart manuscript). He also made significant bequests to the English Language and Literature Faculty and the Life and Environmental Sciences Faculty at Oxford University. These bequests provide funds to this day. His will also established the &quot;Chatterton Lectures on Poetry&quot;: an annual lecture to be given by a lecturer, under the age of 40, on the life and works of a deceased English poet (interpreted as &#x27;a deceased poet who wrote in the English language&#x27;). An inaugural lecture on Meyerstein himself was delivered in 1955 by the historian Lionel Butler, husband of Gwendoline Butler. He is buried at St John-at-Hampstead in the churchyard.

==Inner life==
:&quot;I suspect – but you mustn&#x27;t tell anybody – that I was born out of Jane Austen by Apuleius.&quot; E. H. W. M.

The Daily Telegraph commenting on Meyerstein&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Of My Early Life&quot; noted &quot;Out of this strange obsessed life came strange obsessed novels and poems which could have been written by nobody else&quot;. John Wain in his own autobiography &quot;Sprightly Running&quot;, recalled of the neurotic poet that he emerged from Oxford with a backward looking, almost Johnsonian determination to dig in and cherish the old values while the tide of modernism swept over him. He described him as a disconcerting friend, with a taste for rather cruel or sinister jokes and recorded some strange miserly habits such as reusing old Christmas cards. Meyerstein himself in his autobiography makes no secret of his taste for flagellation. His editor Rowland Watson quotes a letter recording a beating by an assistant master at his Prep school (a good-looking Bristolian). While the master said his conceit must be whipped out of him, Meyerstein comments &quot;Poor man – he was only whipping it in, had he but known&quot;. His passion for collecting extended to an extraordinary collection of whips from many countries, which were discovered under his bed after his death and burned.

<text>Brown Book is an album by Death in June, released in 1987.

&quot;To Drown A Rose&quot; was released as a 10&quot; single, backed with non-album tracks &quot;Europa: The Gates of Heaven&quot; and &quot;Zimmerit&quot;. This single was later re-released as part of the 1989 compilation &quot;The Corn Years&quot;. The song features Rose McDowall on lead vocals.

The album is named after an index of West Germans who were previously involved in Germany&#x27;s National Socialist government, compiled by East German authorities and published in 1965. Numerous songs on the album make extensive use of quotations from literature, including Jean Genet&#x27;s 1948 novel &quot;Funeral Rites&quot; (&quot;To Drown a Rose&quot;, &quot;The Fog of the World&quot;), and Yukio Mishima&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;Spring Snow&quot; (&quot;Touch Defiles&quot;).

The sale of &quot;Brown Book&quot; has been prohibited in Germany since 2005 due to the title track&#x27;s sampling of the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;, the anthem of the Sturmabteilung. In response to the proposed ban, Douglas P. submitted statements to the German authorities explaining large passages of his work, including noting that the sample of &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot; was juxtaposed against samples from the film &quot;The World that Summer&quot;. The samples in question included that of a Jewish grandmother describing her &quot;suicidal fatalism&quot;, and homophobic statements from her lover, an SA officer.

&quot;Flasher&quot;′s keel was laid down 30 September 1942 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 20 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Eleanor Saunders — wife of Lieutenant Commander Willard A. Saunders, commanding officer of the submarine — and commissioned 25 September 1943, Lieutenant Commander Reuben T. Whitaker in command.

== First and second war patrols, January – May 1944 ==
&quot;Flasher&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor from New London 15 December 1943 to prepare for her first war patrol, for which she sailed 6 January 1944. Bound for her patrol area off Mindoro, she sank her first target 18 January, sending a 2,900-ton former gunboat &quot;Yoshida Maru&quot; to the bottom. Adding to what would be the greatest total of enemy tonnage credited to an American submarine in World War II, she sank the freighter Taishin Maru (1,723 tons) off Manila 5 February, and sank two cargo ships of the same convoy on 14 February. &quot;Flasher&quot; arrived at Fremantle, Australia 29 February to refit. The 2 vessels sunk 14 February 1944 were the &quot;Minryo Maru&quot; (1,679 tons) and the &quot;Hokuan Maru&quot; (3,712 tons). See . (The &quot;Hokuan Maru&quot; probably rammed and sunk the 9 September 1943.)

Action-bound once more, the submarine departed Fremantle 4 April 1944 for the coast of French Indochina on her second war patrol. On 29 April she contacted the French aviso &quot;Tahure&quot; guarding a freighter (&quot;Song Giang Maru&quot;, 1065 grt) off the Hon Doi Islands, and sank both. After sinking a large cargo ship (Teisen Maru) in the Sulu Sea 9 May, &quot;Flasher&quot; set course for Fremantle, arriving 28 May for refit until 19 June.

== Third and fourth war patrols, June – October 1944 ==
&quot;Flasher&quot; made her third war patrol in the South China Sea, where on 28 June 1944 she contacted a heavily escorted convoy of 13 ships. She made a cautious approach, undeterred by the escort, and shortly after midnight 29 June, broke into the convoy to sink a freighter (Nippo Maru 6,079 tons) and badly damage a large passenger cargo ship. Her next victim was a freighter (Koto Maru 3,557 tons), sunk 7 July. Twelve days later, &quot;Flasher&quot; sighted cruiser &quot;Ōi&quot; escorted by a destroyer. Two attacks, each followed by a heavy depth charge retaliation from the destroyer, sufficed to sink the cruiser, a fact confirmed several hours later when a periscope observation revealed only the destroyer in sight. Seven days later, she sank another important target, a merchant tanker (Otoriyama Maru 5,280 tons), and the same day damaged another tanker (Tosan Maru) later sunk by one of her sisters. With all her torpedoes gone, &quot;Flasher&quot; put back for Fremantle, where she replenished and refitted between 7 August and 30 August.
During her fourth war patrol, in the Philippines, &quot;Flasher&quot; headed a coordinated attack group which included two other submarines, and . Although she was on lifeguard station during the air attacks preliminary to the invasion of the Philippines during part of this patrol, &quot;Flasher&quot; sank three ships, a former light cruiser (Saigon Maru 5,350 tons) on 18 September, a transport and hospital ship (Ural Maru 6,374 tons) on 27 September, and a cargo ship (Taibin Maru 6,886 tons) on 4 October. She returned to Fremantle 20 October.

== Fifth and sixth war patrols, November 1944 – April 1945 ==

Lieutenant Commander George W. Grider took command of &quot;Flasher&quot; on 31 October 1944.&lt; Heading the same attack group, &quot;Flasher&quot; departed on her fifth war patrol 15 November 1944, bound for Cam Ranh Bay. On 4 December one of her companions reported a tanker convoy, and &quot;Flasher&quot; set a converging course. As she made her approach in a heavy downpour, a destroyer suddenly loomed up before her, and &quot;Flasher&quot; launched her first spread of torpedoes at this escort. The destroyer (Kishinami) was stopped by two hits, and began listing and smoking heavily. &quot;Flasher&quot; got a spread of torpedoes away at a tanker before she was forced deep by a second destroyer, which dropped 16 depth charges. Rising to periscope depth, &quot;Flasher&quot; located the tanker burning and covered by yet a third destroyer. Speedily reloading, she prepared to sink the destroyer and finish off the tanker, and though almost blinded by rainsqualls, she did so with a salvo of four torpedoes, two of which hit the destroyer (Iwanami), and two of which passed beneath her, as planned, to hit the tanker (Hakko Maru 10,022 tons). Once more, counter-attack forced &quot;Flasher&quot; down, and when she surfaced she found no trace of the two damaged destroyers. The tanker, blazing away, was still guarded by three escorts until abandoned at sunset, when &quot;Flasher&quot; sank her with one torpedo. The two destroyers, both found after the war to have been sunk, were &quot;Kishinami&quot; and &quot;Iwanami&quot;.

&quot;Flasher&quot; contacted another well-guarded tanker convoy on the morning of 21 December 1944, and she began a long chase, getting into position to attack from the unguarded shoreward side. In rapid succession, &quot;Flasher&quot; attacked and sank three of the tankers (Omurosan Maru 9,204 tons, Otowasan Maru 9,204 tons, and Arita Maru 10,238 tons), receiving no counter-attack since the enemy apparently believed he had stumbled into a minefield. One of these tankers was the largest &quot;Flasher&quot; sank during the war. The other two tankers had displacements similar to each other, were tied for third largest.

Refitting at Fremantle once more between 2 January and 29 January 1945, &quot;Flasher&quot; made her sixth war patrol on the coast of Indochina. Contacts were few, but on 21 February she sank a sea truck by surface gunfire, and 4 days later sank a cargo ship (Koho Maru 850 tons) with torpedoes. She completed her patrol upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor 3 April 1945, and sailed a few days later for a West Coast overhaul.

== Post-war ==

Bound for Guam on a seventh war patrol at the close of the war, &quot;Flasher&quot; was ordered back to New London, where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve 16 March 1946, Grider relinquishing command of her that month. She was attached to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On 1 June 1959 &quot;Flasher&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was sold for scrap on 1 June 1963.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Flasher&quot;′s conning tower was removed and placed on display as a memorial at the entrance to Nautilus Park, a Navy housing area in Groton, Connecticut. It was then moved to the intersection of Thames Street and Bridge Street in Groton, where it is the centerpiece of a World War II memorial that honors the 52 U.S. submarines and their crews lost during the war. Its upkeep was originally the responsibility of the Submarine Veterans of World War II organization and was then transferred to U. S. Submarine Veterans, Inc.

== Awards ==
&quot;Flasher&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation for her brilliantly successful third, fourth, and fifth war patrols. For her six war patrols, each designated &quot;Successful&quot;, she received six battle stars.

<doc id="1080047" wikidata="Q1822124" url="?curid=1080047" title="Geoffrey Pyke">
<text>Geoffrey Nathaniel Joseph Pyke (9 November 1893 – 21 February 1948) was an English journalist, educationalist, and inventor.

Pyke came to public attention when he escaped from internment in Germany during World War I. He had travelled to Germany under a false passport, and was soon arrested and interned.

During the Second World War, Pyke proposed the newly invented material, pykrete, for the construction of the ship &quot;Habakkuk&quot;.

== Early life ==
Pyke&#x27;s father, Lionel Edward Pyke, was a Jewish lawyer who died when Pyke was only five, leaving his family with no money. His mother quarrelled with relatives and made life &quot;hell&quot; for her children. She sent Pyke to Wellington, then a public school mainly for the sons of Army officers. At his mother&#x27;s insistence, Pyke maintained the dress and habits of an Orthodox Jew. He became an atheist when he was thirteen. The persecution he suffered instilled in him a hatred of and contempt for &quot;The Establishment&quot;. After two years at Wellington, he was withdrawn, tutored privately and then admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, to study law.

== First World War ==
At the outbreak of the First World War, Pyke quit his studies to become a war correspondent. He persuaded the editor of the Daily Chronicle to send him to Berlin. He used the passport obtained from an American sailor by travelling via Denmark. In Germany, he conversed with local Germans, and eavesdropped on other people&#x27;s conversations, witnessing the mobilisation of Germans for war with the Russian Empire.

In early October, 1914, after six days in Germany, Pyke was arrested in his bed-sitting room, and was taken away leaving a letter written in English on his desk. Confined to a small cell in solitary confinement, he believed that he might not be executed after all; remarking that &quot;the German government was not going to waste 4d on my keep if it was going to be faced with burial expenses on the fifth day&quot;. During captivity, he reflected on hunger:

During confinement, Pyke longed for books, writing material and socialising. When allowed out for exercise, he moved around the yard and exchanged words with other inmates. He pieced together poems from memory – &quot;If&quot; by Rudyard Kipling and &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; by Lewis Carroll – and recited them loudly in the darkness. During this time, Pyke questioned his sanity.

In January 1915, he was transferred to another prison where he was able to mix with other prisoners and buy newspapers, learning that thousands of foreigners had passed through this prison for a period of quarantine before being transferred to the internment camp at Ruhleben. Five days later, he was transferred to a third prison in Moabit, and then to the internment camp at Ruhleben.

At Ruhleben, Pyke met fellow graduates from Oxford and Cambridge. They supplied him with extra clothes, food, books and other amenities. Pyke soon became ill and he nearly died of double pneumonia and food poisoning, but recovered in summer. Despite illness, he thought about the possibility of escape and repeatedly questioned fellow inmates. Most were pessimistic about escape, but an Englishman, Edward Falk, agreed despite the low success rate of other attempts. Pyke compiled statistical data on previous escapes, and together with Falk, made a decision to escape, following a regime of calisthenic exercise to prepare. On the afternoon of 9 July 1915, Pyke and Falk crept into a hut and hid under tennis nets, using glare from the sunset to blind the patrolling guard. Successful, they waited until dark and climbed over the perimeter fences.

Pyke and Falk took a tram into Berlin, buying clothes and camping equipment and then traveled west. Within of the Dutch border, they decided to walk, traversing barbed wire fences and quagmire. Approaching the border, they consumed what remained of their food and discarded their equipment apart from some rope made from string, deciding to cross the Dutch frontier. As they rested, they were discovered by a soldier and tried to talk their way out of the encounter, only to discover the soldier was Dutch and they were already inside the Netherlands. From here, made their way to England. Pyke visited his news editor to confess that his mission had failed. However, the editor told Pyke that the story of his escape, based on a long telegraph report Pyke had sent from Amsterdam, had become one of the biggest Fleet Street scoops of the war. Pyke was the first Englishman to get into Germany and out again, and he was encouraged to write a series of articles for the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Pyke refused, citing lost interest in being a war correspondent. He divided his time between lecturing on his experiences and writing for the Cambridge Magazine, edited by Charles Kay Ogden.

Pyke arranged for some food parcels to be sent to friends in Ruhleben; the boxes contained details of his method of escape concealed in false bottoms. Although his parcels arrived, no prisoner attempted to repeat his methods. As an escaped prisoner of war, he was exempt from conscription and his views had begun to drift towards pacifism. He wrote a memoir of his experiences, &quot;To Ruhleben – And Back&quot;, and published in 1916. Because the war was still on at that time, Pyke omitted some details of his escape from his account. &quot;To Ruhleben – And Back&quot; was republished in 2002. In March 1918, Pyke met Margaret Amy Chubb, they were married within three months of meeting.

== Between the wars ==

===Malting House School ===

Between the First and Second World Wars, Pyke attempted a number of money-making schemes, speculating on the commodity market, using his own system of financial management and working through a number of different stockbrokers to avoid attention and higher stock broking charges. The Pykes had a son, David Pyke (1921–2001), and Pyke became preoccupied by the question of his son&#x27;s education. In October 1924, to create an education that differed from his own and promoted curiosity whilst equipping young people to live in the twentieth century, he set up an infants&#x27; school in his Cambridge home. His wife, Margaret, was a strong supporter of the school and its ideas. Pyke recruited a psychologist, Susan Sutherland Isaacs, to run the school, and although Pyke had many original ideas regarding education, he promised her that he would not interfere.

Pyke continued with his city speculations which funded the Malting House School.
The Malting House School was based on the theories of the American philosopher and educationist John Dewey. It fostered the individual development of children; children were given great freedom and were supported rather than punished. The teachers were seen as observers of the children, who were seen as research workers. For a short time, The Maltings was a critical if not a commercial success; it was visited by many educationists and it was the subject of a film documentary. Pyke had ambitious plans for the school and began to interfere with the day-to-day running, whereupon Susan Isaacs left The Maltings.

In 1927, Pyke lost all his money and became bankrupt. The Malting House School was forced to close, Margaret Pyke had to take a job as a headmistress&#x27;s secretary; she left Geoffrey although they were never divorced. Already suffering from periodic fits of depression and burdened with huge debts to his brokers, he withdrew from normal life altogether and survived on donations from close friends.

=== Work against antisemitism ===

In 1934, Pyke opposed the wave of antisemitism in Nazi Germany, citing humanitarian reasons. Pyke campaigned for Christian leaders to make simultaneous public statements condemning the Nazis, raising money to set up an organisation to combat anti-Semitism. He wrote a number of magazine articles on the irrationality of prejudice and started work on a book. In his published letters and articles, Pyke insisted that it was necessary to collect data and this struck a chord with other thinkers who would – giving full credit for the germ of an idea to Pyke – go on to establish the Mass Observation project that set out to document the lives of ordinary Britons.

=== Voluntary Industrial Aid for Spain ===

During the Spanish Civil War, Pyke founded the Voluntary Industrial Aid for Spain (VIAS) organisation, encouraging individuals with little money to contribute their time and skills instead. This was opposed by trade unionists who believed that unpaid work might set a dangerous precedent, but Pyke persisted. By October 1938, twenty-five vehicles had been sent to Spain including two mobile blood transfusion units, and by the end of the war, more than seventy vehicles had been contributed. Organised by Trade Unions, workers were, with the assistance of sympathetic employers who lent the use of machines and premises, able to produce useful items of equipment. Pyke also invented a motorcycle sidecar to carry medical supplies or a patient. He raised funds to pay for American-built Harley-Davidson motorcycles that were then plentifully available second-hand, and persuaded workers to make the sidecars free of charge with the results being sent out to Spain.

Pyke also assisted in arranging for the manufacture of mattresses for the Spanish government, for the collection of redundant horse-drawn ploughs for Spanish farmers, and bundles of hand-tools for use by labourers. He published aggressive propaganda brochures pointing out that British workers were not to consider their contributions a form of charity while Spanish people were fighting and dying for their fellow workers. To answer a shortage of bandages and dressings in Spain, he suggested that sun-dried peat moss sewn into muslin bags could be used as a substitute for cotton dressings. Soon, moss collected by volunteers in Britain was on its way to Spain.

== Second World War==

=== Spying on Nazi Germany ===
In 1939, before the outbreak of the Second World War, Pyke considered the problem of finding out what the German people actually thought of the Nazi regime. His idea was to perform an opinion poll in secret by sending volunteers to Germany to interview ordinary people. He would train the volunteers personally. The plan was that the interviewers should pose as golfers on a tour of Germany and that interviews should be informal, with the questions being inserted into everyday conversation; the first German city to be targeted would be Frankfurt. Pyke travelled to Frankfurt where he met Peter Raleigh. Raleigh suggested that there were enough of Pyke&#x27;s golfers in Germany to challenge the Frankfurt golf club to a match. Pyke concluded that this would be an excellent idea, and put this new plan into action.

By 21 August, Pyke had ten interviewers working in Germany. On 25 August, following hints from contacts at the Foreign Office, Pyke recalled all his agents and they arrived back in England over the following few days. Pyke&#x27;s original idea had been to present Hitler with an account of the true feelings of the German people, but this did not materialise with the outbreak of war. Raleigh and Patrick Smith did make a broadcast on the newly formed BBC World Service in which they contrasted the mood in Germany with that in London, and Pyke prepared a report for the War Office.

Pyke tried to generate interest in his opinion poll results and in repeating the exercise in Germany using people from neutral countries. He got little support, but did attract the attention of Conservative Member of Parliament Leo Amery. Amery did think that Pyke&#x27;s idea was worthwhile and privately convinced others including Clement Attlee and Sir Stafford Cripps. Pyke&#x27;s friends concluded that nothing would come of the scheme and persuaded Pyke to let the matter drop.

=== Military inventions ===
Pyke then wrote on grand strategy and worked on a number of ideas for practical inventions. Inspired by the sight of barrage balloons, he conceived the idea of using them to mount microphones allowing the location of aircraft to be ascertained by triangulation. Pyke was unaware that the development of radar provided a much better means of achieving this effect.

==== Operation Plough / First Special Service Force ====
With the invasion of Norway, Pyke considered the problem of transporting soldiers rapidly over snow. He proposed the development of a screw-propelled vehicle based on an old patent called the Armstead snow motor. This consisted of a pair of lightweight cylinders, shaped like very large artillery shells, to support the weight of the vehicle. These cylinders have a spiral flange that digs into the snow; when the cylinders turn (in opposite directions), the vehicle is propelled forwards. Pyke envisaged that a small force of highly mobile soldiers could occupy the attentions of many enemy soldiers who would be required to guard against possible points of attack.

Initially, Pyke&#x27;s idea was rejected. Then, in October 1941, Louis Mountbatten replaced Roger Keyes as Chief of Combined Operations. This changed the character of the department and Mountbatten allowed unusual talents and ideas. Conservative Member of Parliament Leo Amery wrote to Mountbatten recommending that Pyke&#x27;s Norway scheme, originally rejected by Keyes, be re-examined and that Mountbatten should take Pyke onto his staff. Mountbatten valued Pyke&#x27;s ideas, and for liberalising other staff, eventually adopted the plan. The scheme became Operation Plough. When presented to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, he noted in the minutes of the meeting:

Pyke&#x27;s snow vehicle project was superseded by Canadian development of the Weasel tracked personnel carrier, produced first for the American-Canadian commando unit the First Special Service Force, which trained first for Norway but was actually deployed in Italy. The US built hundreds of these as the M29 vehicle.

==== Project Habakkuk ====

In April 1942, Pyke was presented with the problem of how to prevent the icing of ships in Arctic waters. He took the problem to Max Perutz at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge; Pyke knew that Perutz had previously worked on the physical properties of snow with regard to the difficulties of Operation Plough. Perutz proposed a solution and in a footnote his memorandum noted that:

In September 1942, Pyke sent a 232-page memorandum to Mountbatten detailing his ideas. It suggested a number of uses for ice and for super cooled water (water that has been cooled below its freezing point while remaining liquid) and the suggestion of the construction of gigantic aircraft carriers from ice that was either frozen naturally or artificially. Whereas conventional aircraft carriers were restricted to relatively small, specialised aircraft, these could launch and land conventional fighters and bombers. As such, they could provide air cover for convoys in mid-Atlantic, staging posts for long flights over seas or as launch pads for amphibious assaults on France or Japan. A biography of Pyke by David Lampe indicates that he had decided to use ice reinforced with wood fibres, but other accounts make it clear that this is not the case. Pyke was not the first to suggest a floating mid-ocean stopping point for aircraft, nor the first to suggest that such a floating island could be made of ice, German scientist Dr. A. Gerke of Waldenburg in Germany proposed the idea and carried out some preliminary experiments in Lake Zurich in 1930.

Pyke&#x27;s memorandum included a couple of cover notes. The first requested that Mountbatten should read the suggestions himself before allowing it to fall into the hands of &quot;that damned fool Lushington&quot;. The second, longer, note asked that Mountbatten read the first thirty pages of the memorandum before deciding whether it was worthwhile to continue &quot;It may be gold: it may only glitter. I can&#x27;t tell. I have been hammering at it too long and am blinded&quot;. Mountbatten handed it to Brigadier Wildman-Lushington, and Lushington with the assistance of J. D. Bernal, concluded that Pyke&#x27;s main proposals were feasible. In December 1942, Prime Minister Churchill issued a directive that research on the project should be pressed forward with the highest priority and he expressed the opinion that nature be allowed to do as much of the work as possible.

The project to build a large aircraft carrier of pykrete was known as Project Habakkuk, and Pyke was sent to Canada with a personal introduction from Winston Churchill to Mackenzie King. While he was away, an Admiralty committee headed by the Chief of Naval Construction sent a memorandum about Habakkuk to Mountbatten. Pyke returned from Canada. Pyke&#x27;s original memorandum mentioned other applications for pykrete such as building landing ships for the prospective invasion of Japan and for quickly constructing fortifications at a beachhead by spraying an existing building with pykrete liquid that would freeze into a thick layer. Many of these ideas relied upon a misplaced faith in the qualities of supercooled water which he thought could be used as a weapon of war: pumped from a ship it could be used to instantly form bulwarks of ice or even be sprayed directly onto enemy soldiers. However, such ideas were according to Max Perutz, impractical.

In September 1943, Pyke proposed a slightly less ambitious plan for pykrete vessels to be used in support of an amphibious assault. He proposed a pykrete monitor long and wide mounting a single naval gun turret; this could be self-powered or towed to where it would be used. He also suggested the use of pykrete to make breakwaters and landing stages. At the time, Max Perutz thought the ideas were practical and that the preceding research on pykrete was sufficiently advanced to allow Pyke&#x27;s plan to be executed.&lt;ref name = &quot;ADM 1/15677&quot;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was not put into action, but for the allied invasion of Normandy a system of preconstructed concrete breakwaters and landing stages called Mulberry was employed. Pyke&#x27;s plans hint that he had some knowledge of the Mulberry plans, perhaps through his contacts with Bernal, who was one of Mulberry&#x27;s progenitors.

==== Men in pipes ====
In late 1943, Pyke submitted to Mountbatten a memorandum, nearly fifty pages long, explaining his ideas for a solution to the problem of unloading stores from ships where no proper port facilities are available and few roads inland. This circumstance was common in the Pacific War theatre and fundamental to the 1943 decision to invade France by landing on the beaches of Normandy, with no harbours and a 24-foot tide. Pyke&#x27;s idea was to use pipes of the type that were used to transport fuel from ship to shore, to move sealed containers that would contain any type of sufficiently small material objects. Pyke suggested that pipes would handle smaller equipment and larger objects could be passed through two-foot pipes. Furthermore, there was no reason why the pipes should stop at the shore, they could be extended inland as required. Bernal gave a cautious endorsement to the idea, adding that it would require a great deal of investigation. Pyke&#x27;s idea was similar to the cleaning brushes that are sometimes forced along pipes by the pressure of the fluid and to the pipeline pigs which today are used for cleaning and telemetry.

Pyke then proposed that his idea for &quot;Power-Driven Rivers&quot; could be extended to the transport of personnel. The pipes would need to be at least two feet in diameter and the pressures would have to be high. He worked out ideas for supplying the passengers with oxygen and suggested that the problem of claustrophobia might be alleviated by travelling in pairs and by the use of barbiturate drugs.
Pyke proposed that this system could be used to move people from ship to shore, from island to island, through swamps and over mountains and anywhere where conventional transport was difficult. The idea was never used.

== After World War II ==
After World War II, Pyke&#x27;s inventions continued. One suggestion for the problems of energy-starved post-war Europe was to propel railway wagons by human muscle power – employing 20 to 30 men on bicycle-like mechanisms to pedal a cyclo-tractor. Pyke reasoned that the energy in a pound of sugar cost about the same as an equivalent energy in the form of coal and that while Europe had plenty of sugar and unemployed people, there was a shortage of coal and oil. He recognised that such a use of human muscle power was in some ways distasteful, but could not see that the logic of arguments about calories and coal were unlikely to be sufficiently persuasive.

Pyke was given a commission to look into the problems of the National Health Service and, characteristically, made his contribution as a part of a minority report. He remained eager to convey his unconventional ideas, and continued to both write and broadcast them. He campaigned against the death penalty, and for government support of UNICEF.

== Death and legacy ==
On the evening of Saturday 21 February 1948 in Steele&#x27;s Road, Hampstead, Pyke shaved his beard and consumed a bottleful of sleeping pills. His landlady found his body the following Monday morning. The coroner gave a verdict of suicide at a moment of mental unbalance. Before consuming the pills, he had written private letters that made it clear that his death was premeditated. An obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; praised him and lamented his passing, beginning with the words:

<doc id="1080063" wikidata="Q4120844" url="?curid=1080063" title="Daniel Pope Cook">
<text>Daniel Pope Cook (1794 – October 16, 1827) was a politician, lawyer and newspaper publisher from the U.S. state of Illinois. An anti-slavery advocate, he was the state&#x27;s first attorney general, and then became a congressman. He is the namesake of Cook County, Illinois.

==Early life==
Daniel Pope Cook was born in 1794 in Scott County, Kentucky, into an impoverished branch of the prominent Pope family of Kentucky and Virginia. Cook moved to Kaskaskia, Illinois in 1815 and took a job as a store clerk, but soon began to read law under the supervision of his uncle, Nathaniel Pope.

==Career==
Territorial governor Ninian Edwards appointed young Cook the territorial Auditor of Public Accounts in 1816, so Cook moved to Edwardsville, Illinois, and purchased &quot;The Illinois Herald&quot; newspaper (with Daniel Blackwell) from Matthew Duncan, renaming it &quot;The Western Intelligencer&quot;. Uncle Nathaniel Pope became a delegate to the U.S. Congress from the Illinois Territory, so upon the election of James Monroe as president, Cook moved to Washington, D.C. to establish his career in the nation&#x27;s capitol. In 1817 Cook travelled to London to deliver dispatches and bring back John Quincy Adams, the country&#x27;s representative to Great Britain, whom President Monroe appointed to serve as secretary of state. The two men became closely acquainted during the long voyage back.

Shortly after Cook returned from England, tired of service as a mere dispatch-bearer, he moved back to Illinois, where he became an ardent supporter of statehood. Cook used his newspaper and new appointment as clerk to the territorial house to influence the Territorial Legislature, which unanimously passed a resolution urging statehood (and forbidding slavery) on December 10, 1817. Cook also lobbied his friends back in Washington and Virginia, and his uncle conveyed the territorial resolution to the U.S. Congress on January 16, 1818. After both the U.S. Senate and House agreed, President Monroe on April 18, 1818, signed the law authorizing Illinois to hold a convention to adopt a state constitution and elect officers. On December 3, 1818, President Monroe then signed the law admitting Illinois as the 21st state. Despite his successful advocacy of statehood, Cook was unsuccessful in his first attempt to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, losing to John McLean by only 14 votes for the short term remaining after Illinois became a state. However, the new state&#x27;s legislature appointed Cook as the first attorney general of Illinois. Cook also had briefly served the territory as judge of the western circuit.

Again running for Congress in 1818, Cook defeated McLean in the general election, and again in 1820 (after a debate over slavery), 1822 and 1824, thus serving as the second representative from Illinois (although the first to serve a full term). While in Congress, Cook served on the Committee on Public Lands and later on the Ways and Means Committee. He secured a grant of government lands to aid in the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. In the 1824 election, Cook also helped defeat a proposed convention to legalize slavery in Illinois, and at year&#x27;s end helped elect John Quincy Adams as President (by one vote when the election was thrown to the House). Cook, in ill-health, campaigned little in 1826, and while he again scored more votes than McLean, the pro-slavery Jacksonian Democrat, Joseph Duncan, won the election. The following spring, President Adams sent Cook on a diplomatic mission to Havana, Cuba, but that did not restore his health. He returned to Edwardsville, and asked to be taken back to his birthplace in Kentucky.

==Family==
On May 6, 1821, Cook married Julia Catherine Edwards, the daughter of his mentor Ninian Edwards (who was related by marriage to the Pope family of Kentucky). After Daniel Cook died, Julia Cook moved back to Belleville, Illinois, but only survived her husband by three years. Their son, John Cook (born 1825), remained true to the family&#x27;s anti-slavery principles and became mayor of Springfield, Illinois, in 1855, brigadier general for Union forces in the Civil War and state representative for Sangamon County, Illinois.

==Death and legacy==
Daniel Cook, who always suffered from poor health, died on October 16, 1827, at the age of 32 in Scott County, Kentucky. Four years after his death, the home county of Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, was named in his honor. He was buried in Kentucky, then reburied with the Lamb family (relatives of his son&#x27;s wife) in 1866 in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois.

<text>The Putney Debates, which took place from 28 October to 8 November 1647, were a series of discussions over the political settlement that should follow Parliament&#x27;s victory over Charles I in the First English Civil War. The main participants were senior officers of the New Model Army who favoured retaining Charles within the framework of a constitutional monarchy, and radicals such as the Levellers who sought more sweeping changes, including one man, one vote and freedom of conscience, particularly in religion. 

Alarmed by what they viewed as the dangerous radicalism and increasing power of the New Model Army, in March 1647 the Presbyterian moderates who dominated the Long Parliament ordered the army to disband, a demand which was refused. In June, the army removed Charles from the custody of Parliament and in August established its headquarters at Putney, just outside the City of Westminster in South West London. Its senior officers or &quot;Grandees&quot; hoped the debates would end political divisions with the Agitators who represented the rank and file, and allow them to reach consensus on a peaceful settlement. Collectively, the two sides were grouped together into the Army Council. 

The debates began on 28 October 1647 at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Putney and continued until 8 November, when senior officers including Thomas Fairfax, Oliver Cromwell, and Henry Ireton, grew concerned at the possible impact on military discipline and closed them down. The most contentious item was that of the right to vote: the Grandees wanted to restrict it to property-owners, but this was challenged by the Leveller spokesman, Colonel Thomas Rainsborough, who encapsulated his and the Levellers&#x27; position by saying:

:&quot; ...for really I thinke that the poorest hee that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest hee; and therefore truly, Sir, I thinke itt&#x27;s cleare, that every man that is to live under a Governement ought first by his owne consent to putt himself under that Governement; and I do think that the poorest man in England is not at all bound in a strict sense to that Government that he hath not had a voice to put Himself under.&quot; (Putney Debates record book 1647, Worcester College, Oxford, MS 65. Spelling and capitalisation as in the original manuscript.)

==Background==
Earlier that summer Sir Thomas Fairfax, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Oliver Cromwell (then Member of Parliament for Cambridge and second-in-command), Henry Ireton (Cromwell&#x27;s son-in-law) and other officers, known as the &quot;Grandees&quot;, attempted to negotiate an inclusive settlement with Charles I of England in the aftermath of the First English Civil War. Termed the Heads of Proposals, these included provisions for social justice, but the monarchy and House of Lords would have retained a power of veto over the House of Commons. It also stipulated the king would be restored before the issues of the soldiers&#x27; indemnity for acts committed during the war and their arrears of pay were entrenched in law. This clear compromise position was contrary to the New Model Army&#x27;s Declaration on 14 June and consequently the Heads lost the support of those seeking social reform (at the time generally called Levellers and radicals).

Sometime before October 1647, five of the most radical cavalry regiments elected new Agitators – known as the &quot;New Agents&quot; – to represent their views. The New Agents issued a political manifesto: &quot;The Case of the Armie Truly Stated&quot;. The fundamental ideas of the &quot;Case of the Armie&quot; came to be reflected in a written constitutional draft: the &quot;Agreement of the People&quot;.

The Putney Debates came about as a result of the publication of the &quot;Case of the Armie&quot;. According to the author of a book called &quot;A Call to all the Soldiers of the Armie&quot; (a work usually ascribed to John Wildman), Ireton was so incensed by the &quot;Case of the Armie&quot; that the New Agents were invited to debate the &quot;Case of the Armie&quot; before the General Council of the Army.

==Debates==
The radicals wanted a constitution based upon one man, one vote, biennial Parliaments and a re-organisation of parliamentary constituencies. Authority was to be vested in the House of Commons rather than the King and Lords. Certain &quot;native rights&quot; were declared sacrosanct for all Englishmen: freedom of conscience, freedom from impressment (conscription) into the armed forces and equality before (when judged under or seeking a judgement under) the law.

Since Sir Thomas Fairfax was unwell and could not be present, Cromwell chaired the debates. He flatly refused to accept any compromise in which the King was overthrown, while his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, pressed the case that his own &quot;The Heads of the Proposals&quot; covered all of the concerns raised by the New Agents in &quot;The Case of the Armie&quot;. The New Agents accepted the meeting, sending Robert Everard (identified on the first day of the Putney Debates as &#x27;Buff Coat&#x27;) and another New Agent from Col. Whalley&#x27;s Regiment only identified as &#x27;Bedfordshire Man&#x27; (this was possibly Trooper Matthew Weale, a signatory of the &quot;Case of the Armie&quot; and the &quot;Agreement of the People&quot;). Other members of the Army present were Colonel Thomas Rainsborough, a successful commander in the Civil War, and lately MP for Droitwich, his brother Major William Rainsborough, and the Agitators Edward Sexby and William Allen. The New Agents also brought John Wildman and Maximillian Petty, two civilian advisors who had been involved with Army affairs since at least July 1647.

The debates opened on 28 October and were transcribed by secretary William Clarke and a team of stenographers. From 2 November however, all recording ceased. The debates were not reported and Clarke&#x27;s minutes were not published at the time. They were lost until 1890 when they were rediscovered at the library of Worcester College, Oxford, and subsequently published as part of the Clarke Papers.

Cromwell and Ireton&#x27;s main complaint about the &quot;Agreement&quot; was that it included terms for near universal male suffrage, which Ireton considered to be anarchy. Instead, they suggested suffrage should be limited only to landholders. The Agitators, on the other hand, felt they deserved the rights in payment for their service during the war. Thus Thomas Rainsborough argued:
And Ireton, for the Grandees:
==Conclusion==
The debates concluded with the understanding that a modified version of the &quot;Agreement&quot;, approved by a committee chosen mainly from the ranks of the Army&#x27;s officers, would be the basis of any future constitutional settlement and that it would be presented to the Army itself at a mass meeting. However, the Agitators wanted to discuss the future of the King, leading the Grandees, fearing a complete breakdown of discipline in the Army, to propose on 8 November that the Agitators and New Agents return at once to their regiments to restore order, thereby suspending the meetings. This was reinforced on 11 November when King Charles escaped from Hampton Court Palace, apparently fearing (possibly on the advice of Oliver Cromwell) that the Grandees could easily lose control of the more radical elements in the Army. The King&#x27;s flight brought all debate to an end as the New Model Army was faced with a more immediate threat. On the same day, the General Council drafted a new manifesto to be presented at the mass meeting which contained, among other provisions, a clause in which the members of the army would sign a declaration of loyalty to Lord Fairfax and the General Council (and hence making further agitation when ordered to desist a mutinous offence).

The presentation itself was split from one mass meeting to three smaller ones. Those regiments invited to the first meeting on 15 November agreed with the manifesto, but two regiments arrived uninvited and objected, sparking the Corkbush Field mutiny. Fairfax and Cromwell suppressed the mutiny and at the other two meetings the other regiments agreed to the terms in the manifesto.

On 7 December 1647, at a meeting in Windsor the General Council drew up a non-political petition to present to Parliament called the &quot;Humble Representation of the General Council of the Army&quot; (which requested that Parliament pay the soldiers arrears and secure the future funding of the army), and a month later, on 8 January 1648, the General Council voted to terminate itself.

The symbolic importance of the debates may have been a factor, 36 years later, following the Restoration of the monarchy, when King
Charles II chose Putney Heath as the site of a parade of 6,000 soldiers, in October 1684.

<text>The Tiara of Saitaferne (also Saitaphernes or Saitapharnes) is a tiara in gold sheet, acquired by the Louvre in 1896, afterwards demonstrated to be fake by its creator, Israel Rouchomovsky. 

==History==
On April 1, 1896, the Louvre announced that it had purchased a gold tiara that had belonged to the Scythian king Saitapharnes. The museum had purchased the artifact for 200,000 gold French francs. A Greek inscription on the tiara read &quot;The council and citizens of Olbia honor the great and invincible King Saitapharnes&quot;. To the experts at the Louvre, the tiara confirmed an episode dating to the late 3rd-century BCE or early 2nd-century BCE. According to the story, Saitapharnes had besieged the Greek colony of Olbia and was convinced to leave the city in peace only through the offering of expensive gifts.

Shortly after the Louvre exhibited the tiara, a number of experts challenged its authenticity. Among them was the German archaeologist Adolf Furtwängler who noted many stylistic problems with the tiara&#x27;s design and questioned the lack of aging apparent on the artifact. For several years, the Louvre defended the authenticity of its treasure and even prepared a magnificent book on the treasure. Eventually, news of the story reached Odesa.

In 1894, two years before the Louvre acquisition, two dealers, Schapschelle Hochmann and his brother Leiba, had commissioned Israel Rouchomovsky (fr), a skilled goldsmith from Odesa, to make the tiara. They let him believe that it was intended as a gift for an archaeologist friend and provided Rouchomovsky with details from recent excavations to aid his design. It wasn&#x27;t until news of the Louvre scandal reached him that Rouchomovsky learned of the fate of his creation. He traveled to Paris in 1903 and presented himself as the maker of the tiara. Experts at the museum refused to believe him until he demonstrated the ability to reproduce a portion of the crown. Embarrassed, the museum hid the object away in storage. The Louvre had been fooled in one of the greatest archeological scandals of the century; Rouchomovsky, on the other hand, became famous for his work and earned a gold medal at the Paris Salon of Decorative Arts. He lived in Paris until his death in 1934.

In 1954, the tiara was included in a &quot;Salon of Fakes&quot; at the Louvre. In 1997, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem borrowed the Tiara of Saitapharnes from the Louvre for an exhibition on Israel Rouchomovsky. In 2009, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta borrowed the tiara for a Louvre exhibition. In 2014, a memorial plaque was unveiled on the wall of Rouchomovsky&#x27;s workshop in Odesa where the tiara was created. The &quot;LWL-Museum für Archäologie&quot; in Herne, Germany borrowed the tiara for the opening weeks of their new exhibition &quot;Irrtümer &amp; Fälschungen der Archäologie&quot; (English: &quot;Errors &amp; Forgeries in Archaeology&quot;) in March 2018. 

A copy of the tiara is on display in the British Museum. As of 2009, another was on display at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.

Stock market crashes are quick and brief, while bear markets are slow and prolonged. Those two do not always happen within the same decline.

<text>John Pope Cook (June 12, 1825 – October 13, 1910) was an Illinois politician and a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He served in the Western Theater and played a prominent role in securing the Union victory at the Battle of Fort Donelson, helping to force the surrender of the defenders.

He was the second Congressman from Illinois. In 1855 he was mayor of Springfield and 1856 he became the sheriff of Sangamon County. In 1861 he gathered troops after the bombardment of Confederate of Fort Sumter and after that became colonel of the 7th Illinois Volunteer Infantry.

In 1864 he got a promotion to brigadier general.

== Early life ==
Cook was born in Belleville, Illinois, to a well-connected political family. His maternal grandfather, Ninian Edwards, was a United States senator and the Governor of Illinois. His father was Daniel Pope Cook, who was a member of the United States House of Representatives at the time. Following Daniel&#x27;s death at the age of 33, his widow, Julia Catherine Edwards Cook, moved with their only child, John, back to Belleville, where she died three years later, leaving Cook as an orphan.

Cook received a good education and entered the practice of law. He was elected mayor of Springfield, Illinois, in 1855. Cook was the captain and commander of a military company called the Springfield Grays. He also served as quartermaster general of the Illinois militia.

== Civil War ==
During the early days of the Civil War, Cook&#x27;s militia company enlisted in Federal service in April 1861. They formed the nucleus of Company I of the 7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment, of which Cook was appointed colonel. At the Battle of Fort Donelson, he commanded the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, District of Cairo, Department of the Missouri. During the Confederate breakout attempt on February 15, General Ulysses S. Grant concluded the Confederates must have weakened the opposite flank to reinforce their assault. This weakened sector lay across from the Federal brigades of Cook and Jacob G. Lauman. Lauman&#x27;s brigade was intended as the main thrust while Cook&#x27;s brigade would make a feint to draw away fire. Cook&#x27;s troops nevertheless managed to capture a key Confederate artillery battery, which paved the way for the subsequent collapse of the defensive line in his sector. After the battle he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on March 22, 1862, with Senate confirmation on March 24, 1862, to rank from March 21, 1862. Cook remained in command of his brigade for a short time after Fort Donelson. Though still a colonel he was assigned to command the 6th Division in the Army of the Tennessee. This commanded was promptly turned over to Brig. Gen. Benjamin M. Prentiss who would lead the division at Shiloh. Cook meanwhile was transferred to brigade command in the Washington defenses.

Cook later oversaw the military Department of Iowa and Dakota Territory. In the winter of 1862–63, he organized a campaign against the Sioux Nation, with Sioux City, Iowa, as his base of operations. In the spring of 1863, he was relieved by Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully. In November 1864, he was assigned command of the military District of Illinois, replacing Eleazar Paine, who had resigned the position. Cook was mustered out of the volunteers on August 24, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Cook for appointment to the brevet grade of major general, to rank from August 24, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on March 12, 1866.

== Years after the war ==
Following the war, Cook returned home and was elected as Sangamon County&#x27;s representative in the Illinois General Assembly, in 1869, as a Republican.

Cook died in his home near Ransom, Michigan, in 1910.

<doc id="1080096" wikidata="Q336242" url="?curid=1080096" title="Hubert Maga">
<text>Coutoucou Hubert Maga (August 10, 1916–May 8, 2000) was a politician from Dahomey (now known as Benin). Born a peasant in 1916, Maga served as a schoolmaster from 1936 to 1945, during which time he gradually gained considerable influence among the uneducated. He rose to power despite regionalist politics in Dahomey, and was elected to Dahomey&#x27;s territorial assembly in 1947 and founded the Northern Ethnical Group, later renamed the Dahomey Democratic Rally (&quot;Rassemblement Démocratique du Dahomé&quot;). In 1951, Maga was elected to the French National Assembly, where he served in various positions, including premier from 1959 to 1960. When Dahomey gained its independence from France on August 1, 1960, Maga was appointed to the presidency, and was officially elected to that post on December 11. 

During Maga&#x27;s term of office, Dahomey&#x27;s economy collapsed; there was little foreign investment and unemployment rose. In response, he launched a four-year plan in January 1962, the basis of which was to increase agricultural production by forcing the nation&#x27;s youths to work on the land. Maga also faced a national crisis of unity, culminating in a failed assassination plot against him in May 1961 led by the main opposition leader, Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin. Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin was jailed, and by the time of his release in November 1962, a one-party state had been established and the opposition press had been restricted. In 1963, convicted murderer Christophe Bokhiri was released from prison, prompting riots around the country, but the focus of the rioting soon shifted toward Maga&#x27;s problems as president. The riots became so serious that the Chief of Staff of the Dahomeyan Army, Christophe Soglo, took control of the country in October to prevent a civil war. After forcing Maga to resign, Soglo gave him, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and vice president Sourou Migan Apithy, the titles of Minister of State.

Shortly afterwards, Maga was convicted of plotting to assassinate Soglo and of corruption, for which he was incarcerated. Following his release in 1965, he took refuge in Togo before moving to Paris. In 1970, he returned to Dahomey to serve as head of a rotating three-man presidential council, which included Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin and Apithy. On October 26, 1972, Mathieu Kérékou was installed by a coup, overthrowing then-chairman Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin. Maga and the other members of the council were imprisoned until 1981. Maga retired from public life after his release, only making an appearance at the National Conference of 1990, which gave amnesty to all Beninese political refugees. He died on May 8, 2000.

==Education and teaching career==
Maga was born on August 10 or August 19, 1916 to a peasant family in Parakou, northern Dahomey. Maga claimed he was a descendant of the Kingdom of Bourgou&#x27;s royal family. His Bariba mother and Voltaic father raised him in the Islamic faith.

His education began at Parakou, where his teacher was Emile Derlin Zinsou&#x27;s father, followed by schools in Bohicon and Abomey. Maga moved to Porto Novo to be educated at the Victor Ballot School, where he remained for three years. During his subsequent schooling at the Ponty Normal School in Dakar, Maga became friends with Hamani Diori, the future president of Niger.

In his twenties Maga converted to Roman Catholicism which, according to journalist Ronald Matthews, &quot;was not so common for a northerner&quot;. He became a teacher at Natitingou in 1935. In 1939, he married a fellow Christian, a nurse by profession, and the daughter of a prominent Brazilian of Fon origins from Ouidah.
Marriages between northern and southern Dahomeyans were uncommon at the time.

Maga was appointed director of the school in 1945. Along with his new wife, he began to increase his influence among uneducated citizens. He worked for trade unions after World War II, and led the &quot;Syndicat des instituteurs du Dahomey&quot; (Teachers&#x27; Union of Dahomey).

==Political background==
Maga&#x27;s rise to power occurred during a period of intense regionalism, spurred by the historical resentment shared by members of the former kingdoms of Abomey, Porto Novo, and disorganised tribes from the north. Its result was the creation of three &quot;de facto&quot; tribal zones: the north, southeast, and southwest, which were led by Maga, Sourou Migan Apithy, and Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, respectively. Maga&#x27;s Ethnic Group of the North (later the Dahomeyan Democratic Movement), which merged into the Dahomeyan Democratic Rally in 1957, received little support outside his northern headquarters. Even then, most of his backing came from the Bariba, while Apithy was mostly backed by the Yoruba and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, the Fon and Gouns. Regionalistic attitudes would only intensify during the rest of the political careers of the three men, collectively known as Dahomey&#x27;s triumvirate.

==Early political career==
Maga was elected a general adviser for the Atakora region in 1945, and, two years later, was appointed to the Grand Council of French West Africa, in which he served until 1952. Following his election to the Dahomey General Council in 1947, Maga resigned his teaching post. He subsequently became vice president of the assembly until his resignation in 1957.

Roger Peperty, the French &quot;chef de cercle&quot; of Natitingou and a close acquaintance, encouraged Maga to form an alliance among northerners in early 1949. He wrote in a political report later that year:

He feared that Maga would lean &quot;toward the R.D.A. [African Democratic Rally]&quot; and wanted the young politician to form a different group. The party was to become the &quot;Groupement Ethnique de Nord&quot; (Northern Ethnic Group). Maga, in an April 1968 interview, denied that Peperty ever played a part in the establishment. He claimed that he and his friends came up with the idea.

In the legislative elections of June 17, 1951, when Dahomey was allowed an additional representative in the French National Assembly, Maga ran for that office. The fact that two seats were allotted to Dahomey was only known in the last week of April. As per a May 1951 electoral law, each candidate had to give the names of another who would occupy the second seat in the event that the other party&#x27;s first candidate came in third or below. Maga decided to run with Paul Darboux, a wealthy northern merchant. Capitalising on growing cynicism regarding southern Dahomey dominating the French colony&#x27;s politics, he allied himself with the northern tribes.

The May 1951 law also enlarged the electorate from 61,958 to 333,693. Some dead people were even counted as electors due to the mishandling of election cards. The Cotonou newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Etoile du Dahomey&quot; noted a man who gave an unlimited number of cards as long as they promised to vote for Maga&#x27;s main opponent, accountant and deputy Sourou-Migan Apithy. Altogether, however, only 44% of the population voted on election day. Apithy was reelected a deputy with 53,463 votes out of 147,350 cast, while Maga captured the second seat with 49,329 and third candidate Emile Derlin Zinsou received a mere 18,410 ballots. Several smaller parties hosted several other candidates, which received the rest of the votes. Only 0.5 percent of Maga&#x27;s votes came from the coastal region, while 98 percent came from northern towns and villages. The 1951 election has been cited as when regionalist parties arose, and it was the first whose pamphlets mentioned ethnicity.
==Deputy to the French National Assembly==
In Paris, Maga affiliated himself with the Overseas Independents, a political organization led by Leopold Sedar Senghor of Senegal. However, he was not an ardent supporter of this organization; this lack of commitment was typical of Maga in the following years. He was named the secretary of the Finance Committee, a member of the committee on national education, and a member of the committee on parliamentary privileges. During his first term in the Assembly, he accomplished little apart from proposing a bill on May 13, 1954, that concerned the election of counselors of the Republic from its overseas territories and Trust Territories. With the support of his new party, Maga ran for the renewal of his mandate at the legislative elections held on January 2, 1956. Standing for an &quot;active federalism within the French union&quot;, Maga chose Gaustin Gbaguidi as his running mate. Of the 179,119 votes cast, Maga won 60,601 and Apithy won 64,344.

Later that year, he resigned from his position on the Grand Council of French West Africa. Shortly afterwards, Maga became a member of the committees on national education and on justice and legislation, and was named Secretary of the Assemblée on January 25, 1956. When Félix Gaillard became Prime Minister of France in November 1957, he appointed Maga to the position of Secretary of State of Labor, a post he served in until the end of the Gaillard ministry on April 15, 1958.

Before the territorial elections of 1959, Maga agreed that the R.D.D. would field candidates only in the north of the country if in return Apithy&#x27;s Republican Party of Dahomey (P.R.D.) ran only in the south. The result of the elections was that the P.R.D. received 37 seats with 144,038 votes, the R.D.D. received 22 seats with 62,132 votes, and Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s Dahomey Democratic Union (U.D.D.) received 11 deputies for its 162,179 votes. What followed was described by Matthews as &quot;an immediate explosion&quot;. Supporters of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin took to the streets in rioting so severe that French soldiers were called in to restore order. Following mediation by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin agreed to divide between them 18 contested seats in a southwest constituency. However, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin made it clear that he would not agree to let Apithy retain the office of Prime Minister of Dahomey. Maga was chosen as a compromise for the premiership, and was voted into this post on May 22, 1959.

==Premier of Dahomey==
Maga&#x27;s election coincided with a collapse of the colonial economy. There was little foreign investment in the country, and unemployment was rising. He thus felt that a consultation with the trade unions was necessary before selecting a Minister of Labor, and eventually appointed Paul Darboux to the office. Although Apithy wanted to return to his former position as Prime Minister, he was instead appointed Minister of State without responsibility for any specific department.

In his policy speech upon receiving the premiership, Maga asked his fellow Dahomeyans to end the tribalism that had characterised his country&#x27;s politics. He appealed for unity among Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin supporters and encouraged investments into the economy. Foreign affairs dominated Maga&#x27;s first months in office, but at home the desire for an independent Dahomey was mounting. Apithy announced on September 2, 1959, that he would remove all P.R.D. deputies from the government if Maga did not establish referendums on Dahomey&#x27;s political status. Maga reacted by dismissing Apithy from his cabinet on September 18, and warning P.R.D. deputies that the same would happen to any of them who opposed him on the matter.

Nevertheless, a referendum on independence for Dahomey was held on September 28. It offered Dahomeyans three choices regarding the preferred political status: become a French département, join the French community and become a semi-autonomous state, or obtain full independence. The Dahomeyan people chose the second option, semi-autonomy, and full independence was scheduled for 1960. The premier announced on January 1, that:

Popular opinion was soon behind Maga instead of Apithy. Maga began to form an alliance with Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin, especially after Apithy voted in favor of joining the short-lived Mali Federation, an idea that Maga opposed. In response, the premier added more U.D.D. deputies to his government in a January 1960 cabinet reshuffle. However, they became more vocal in trying to take over Dahomey. Maga began to ally with Chabi Mama and Arouna Mama, who became his closest colleagues.

On August 1, 1960, Maga traveled to Paris to discuss Dahomey&#x27;s political future with Houphouët-Boigny. Following their negotiations, Dahomey was granted its independence. On Maga&#x27;s return to his home country on June 13, he claimed that he had personally requested autonomy. Maga was chosen as Dahoomey&#x27;s first president.

==President of Dahomey==

===&quot;De facto&quot; president===

Shortly after independence, the three parties united as the &quot;Front d&#x27;Action Patriotique&quot; (Patriotic Action Front, or F.A.P.), and reorganised Dahomey into one electoral constituency. It was proposed that there would be an agreed list of electoral candidates, and that all of the legislative seats would be given to the party with the highest number of elected representatives from that list. This arrangement did not last long; Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin broke from the union and, using the discontent among people over the increasing rarity of jobs in the country, incited demonstrations that lasted from September to October 1960. He nevertheless tried to disassociate himself from the rioting. In September, he claimed that a single party state was the only solution to the stagnation of the economy. Since he had recently renounced one party, he was looking for another party to lead.

Dahomey faced a major economic recession. The country had not had a favorable trade balance since 1924, and now that it was independent, France no longer offered subsidies. Maga helped to counter this by investing in the infrastructure and encouraging civil servants to take Dahomey as their residence. Still, Dahomey&#x27;s GDP grew by 1.4 percent annually from 1957 to 1965, making Dahomey&#x27;s economy one of the weakest in Africa.

Meanwhile, Maga made Houphouët-Boigny recognize the R.D.D. as the Dahomeyan wing of his African Democratic Rally (R.D.A.). Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had always believed that the U.D.D. was the sole representative of the Rally. This had helped bring a new political philosophy to the R.D.D., which had, up to this point, done little more than express regionalism without much of a platform.

At the end of October, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin convinced the trade unions that he controlled to begin another strike in protest against Maga&#x27;s inability to promote national development, and to ensure the welfare of the working class. The strike lasted for two days in the cities of Porto Novo and Cotonou, and became so serious that the police used tear gas. It ended when Maga sent down faithful Northerners armed with bows and arrows to patrol the streets at night. On November 2, members of the U.D.D. organized a motion of censure in the National Assembly. Maga relied on Apithy&#x27;s assistance in opposing the motion, and it was ultimately defeated.

===New constitution and official election===
Following the motion of censure&#x27;s defeat, U.D.D. deputies began to resign from their jobs, and five were dismissed. They were replaced by deputies from the P.R.D. On November 13 the P.R.D. and R.D.D. officially merged to form the Dahomeyan Unity Party (P.D.U.) and Maga was elected as its leader. He created a constitution for Dahomey, styling it after that of the French Fifth Republic. The assembly, now led by Djibode Aplogan, adopted the constitution on November 25. The new constitution gave the president the right to ask the National Assembly to reconsider a bill if it did not pass with two-thirds of the votes, and submit referendums. Maga assumed the powers of Commander in Chief of the Dahomeyan Army, although he did not wear its uniform until its capture of the Portuguese enclave of Ajuda on August 1, 1961.

A recently passed electoral law meant that every party that stood in the upcoming official elections had to list candidates for all 60 National Assembly deputies, as well as for president and vice president. Maga&#x27;s only presidential opponent was Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin, whose running mate was Sacca Koto Ngobi. On December 11, 1960, Maga was formally elected as president for a five-year term; he received 468,002 votes, and Apithy vice president with the same term of office. Of Dahomey&#x27;s 971,012 registered voters, 71 percent voted in the election. The P.D.U. received 69 percent of the vote and all 60 seats in the National Assembly. Although the U.D.D. received 31 percent of the popular vote, it did not have a single deputy in the assembly.
Maga&#x27;s original cabinet resigned on December 29. He named the new ministers in his government the next day, and chose many leaders from the former R.D.D. and P.N.D. He appointed Arouna Mama as the Minister of the Interior; Assogba Oké to the post of Foreign Affairs; Paul Darboux to Trade and Economics; Sébastien Dassi to Agriculture; Victorien Gbaguidi to Transport and Public Works; Joseph Kekeh to Justice; René Deroux to Health and Social Affairs; Michel Ahouanmènou to Education; and Alexandre Adandé as Finance Minister. Newcomers were Bertin Borna, Labor and Civil Service; and Albert Teveodjré, the new Information Minister. To prevent a backlash from the opposition, Maga and his ministers moved their offices from Porto Novo to Cotonou, where the U.D.D had received 90 percent of the vote in the recent election.

===Crackdown on opposition and four year plan===
In early 1961, the president began applying repressive measures on the opposition press and anyone suspected of trouble-making, thus effectively silencing Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s voice in the country. The U.D.D.&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Dahomey-Matin&quot;, was shut down in February. Maga commissioned a group of people to announce news to the uneducated from the government perspective. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s trade unions were superseded by Maga&#x27;s General Union of Dahomeyan Workers. The General Union was instantly recognized as the only representative of the General Union of Black American Workers in Dahomey.

By April, most U.D.D. members had expressed their interest in joining the P.D.U., which Maga encouraged. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin did not share his colleagues&#x27; keenness; nevertheless, the choice was soon made for him—the U.D.D. was dissolved by Maga on April 11, and less than a week later, so were Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s trade unions. Maga declared that the country of Dahomey &quot;ha[d] at last been born.&quot; Since Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was unable and unwilling to pursue a coup d&#x27;état, he decided to conspire against the president.

On May 26, Albert Teveodjré notified Maga that Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had plotted to assassinate the president. He and 11 other dissidents were arrested, and a trial date was set for December. The trial differed from many others held in Africa in that it was conducted in public, and the defendants were represented by a lawyer from Paris. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin received five years in jail for his role in the conspiracy, and the others received sentences from one to ten years. Maga ultimately released them on November 3, 1962, saying in a broadcast that it was not only due to their good behavior in jail but also to reconcile with his former enemies.

With the threat from his enemies thus removed, Maga could focus on developing the national economy. He designed a four-year growth plan, to begin on January 1, 1962, that contained many ambitious acts, though this was frequently revised to be more realistic. It was designed to increase agricultural yields and was financed by French capital. Part of the plan was to cut wages by ten percent. Young Dahomeyans would contribute &quot;human investment&quot;, or forced labor on the fields. If they failed to do so,
Maga would revoke their citizenship and disqualify them from citizenship in nations in the African and Malagasy Union.

To ensure against a student uprising, the president combined the two major youth organizations in Dahomey, chapters of the World Federation of Youth and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, into the National Union of Dahomeyan Youth. It was to remain a nationally run organization, unaffiliated with any international institution. Nonetheless, he would do nothing more than reprimand students who protested him, not even revoke their scholarships. On December 31, 1961, the Maga administration raised certain taxes, including those on income, transportation, and permits in an attempt to balance his country&#x27;s budget. He nonetheless ran into trouble in the enforcement of his plan. Throughout his first term as president, Maga toured various parts of Dahomey to bring enthusiasm to his plan, offering undeveloped land to its supporters.

Despite the economic hardship, the president commissioned French architect Chomette to design a presidential palace. At a cost of US$3 million, the building dominated Cotonou&#x27;s promenade on its completion in 1963. The new palace contained a golden and marble porch, mosaic stairwells, pebble dash walls, and a two-story flag outdoors.

Maga decided to reshuffle the cabinet in February 1962. He added the Planning and Development duties to Apithy&#x27;s office to quench his thirst for power. Nonetheless, Apithy accused Maga of being a dictator, and a series of demonstrations the Vice President coordinated would ultimately force Maga out of office. These were not sparked by Maga himself, but rather the murder of David Dessou.

===Dessou riots and 1963 coup d&#x27;état===

January 1962 saw the poisoning of Dessou, an official of the Sakete sub-prefecture. The deputy from his constituency, named Christophe Bokhiri, was accused of the crime and duly arrested. He was released after his fellow deputies in the National Assembly requested to suspend proceedings against him under the parliamentary immunity clauses of the Dahomey Constitution, specifically Article 37. Maga, meanwhile, was away in Paris during all of this.

The people of Dahomey were outraged at Bokhiri&#x27;s release. Racial clashes broke out in the summer of 1963, as the murderer and the victim were of different tribes. Demonstrations were organized in Porto Novo on October 21 and soon spread to Cotonou. They remained somewhat orderly before the trade unionists were involved. While still led by Maga, the trade unionists were still upset by the wage cut and used the case to further their interests. In addition, they criticized what they called Maga&#x27;s &quot;squander-mania&quot;, such as the construction of a presidential palace. Most of the demonstrations were peaceful, although several demonstrators destroyed a hospital sign containing Maga&#x27;s name. Six trade unionists were arrested on the second day of demonstrations, causing the unions to call a general strike. By the end of the second day, protesters forced the National Assembly to put Bokhiri back in jail, and the Assembly simultaneously enforced a curfew.

In light of these events, Maga canceled his trip to the United States and returned to Dahomey immediately. Appealing for peace, he convened a special National Assembly session. The protesters and trade unionists were indifferent to his efforts toward reconciliation. When Maga agreed with their demands and replaced his government with a provisional one in which Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had equal standing, they organized themselves to protest this new order. Armed northerners came down to Cotonou to support Maga and clashed with dissenters, killing two. The protesters, however, would not return to their jobs until Maga no longer held his.

They were to get their wish. On October 28 Chief of Staff of the 800-man Dahomeyan Army Christophe Soglo took control of the country to prevent a civil war. He dismissed the cabinet, dissolved the Assembly, suspended the constitution, and banned any type of demonstrations. After having Maga sign his resignation the same day he gave Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin the powers of the Ministry of State. Southern Dahomey later created a statue in honor of this day in national history.

==Minister of State and house arrest==
The provisional government dissolved the P.D.U. and replaced it with a Dahomeyan Democratic Party (P.D.D.). It announced that a referendum on the status of the constitution was to be held on December 15. At the same time, a committee was established to investigate alleged wrongdoings by the Maga administration. In late November it began prosecuting members of the cabinet, including the Minister of National Economy and the Finance Minister, for misusing public funds.

Despite the friendly relationship between the two men, Soglo held Maga responsible for an assassination plot against him which was discovered in early December. Maga resigned his position in the provisional government on December 4, shortly before being placed under house arrest in an unidentified village. He was accompanied by a butler, a cook, and a driver. Four former cabinet members. were placed in less comfortable prisons. At an official inquiry, the conspiracy charge was dropped, but Maga was found guilty of corruption.

In May 1964, Chabi Mama and a devoted group of Maga supporters tried to remove him from house arrest and reinstate the overthrown president back into power. Author Elisa Daggs called their campaigns &quot;a rampage of terrorism.&quot; They grew so intense that the military was called in to quell the uprisings. At least one of their goals was accomplished in March 1965 when, following a retrial, Maga was released from house arrest. He went into exile in Togo before moving to Paris.

During Maga&#x27;s exile, a number of coups were attempted against Presidents Soglo, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin and their putschists. In order to gain power back, Maga formed a new party while in exile, the Union Nationale Dahoméenne (U.N.D.), on December 9, 1965. It was little more than a vehicle to be recognised in the upcoming elections, to be held before January 18, 1966. Maga and Apithy banded together to protest a special session of the National Assembly on December 21, 1965, that would vote on a new constitution for Dahomey, and the session was never held. Academic Dov Ronen speculates that this was because there would be no vice-presidents in the constitution, and the two politicians figured that a coalition would guarantee high offices for both. Neither was to witness a political comeback on January 18, as Soglo seized power on December 22 of the previous year and refused to hold elections.

More coups were to follow, and eventually the military decided to return to civilian rule. All former presidents, vice presidents, government ministers, and National Assembly presidents were disqualified from Dahomey&#x27;s first election since 1964, held on May 15, 1968, by incumbent Alphonse Amadou Alley. In response, Maga and Apithy staged protests while Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin supported an obscure candidate named Basile Adjou Moumouni. Moumouni won the election with 80 percent of the vote, but the result was declared void because the protest prevented nearly three-quarters of the electorate from voting. This result sparked further demonstrations, and Maga, Soglo, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin were forbidden to enter the country, in an attempt to crack down on dissent.

In the wake of further coups, politician Emile Derlin Zinsou was appointed civilian President of Dahomey by the military on June 17, 1968. Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin unified in Paris in opposing the appointment. They established the National Front for the Struggle of Dahomey, whose members promised &quot;not to participate in any government, not to accept the authority of any president who is unacceptable by any of the living forces and the people of Dahomey.&quot; The triumvirate attempted another boycott of Zinsou&#x27;s appointal and the subsequent referendum he chose to hold. However, the plan was not successful, and he was confirmed President of Dahomey on July 28 with 76.4 percent of the electorate voting for him.

==1970 election==
On December 10, 1969, Zinsou was overthrown by Maurice Kouandété, who had installed him as president in the first place. The military, however, refused to recognize Kouandété, and as the two men could not reach agreement, a Military Directorate was established with Paul Emile de Souza as its chairman. An election was held on March 28, 1970, to determine the true president. On this occasion, the triumvirate was allowed to campaign, and they did not miss the chance. Intimidation and bribery were commonplace, and the electoral campaign saw the comeback of regional loyalties. It was also marked by a series of violent outbursts; invalidated reports state that six people were killed or wounded at incidents in Parakou on the eve of the elections. Fellow candidate Zinsou asserted that Maga supporters had killed one of his supporters during said incidents.

These charges did not affect Maga&#x27;s standing in the polls; he received a majority of the vote in the north, and Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin received a majority in the southeast and southwest/central, respectively. The election results were as follows: 252,551 citizens voted for Maga; 200,091 for Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and 186,332 for Apithy. In the entire south, Maga received 24,000 votes compared to the 180,000 who voted for him in the Borgou Department, obtaining 97.3 percent of the 78 percent turnout. Zinsou, running to counter the constant tribal clashes, received 3 percent, with 17,551 votes.

Nonetheless, de Souza decided to nullify the results from Atakora, the region where Maga received the most votes, on April 3. Outraged, Maga formed the Assembly of the Peoples of the North, which threatened to secede unless he was declared President. He refused to leave his campaign headquarters at Parakou even to attend political meetings. Maga&#x27;s reaction to the nullification prompted many southern workers to flee the north. Apithy stated that he would convince his region to join Nigeria if Maga took the presidency and took steps to bribe his way into that office. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin claimed Maga had defrauded the electoral system to his advantage. In contrast with the other three former presidents, Zinsou admitted that he had been defeated and decided participate in bargaining, explaining that he rejected the idea of a coalition &quot;for personal reasons&quot;. The other former Presidents, on the other hand, agreed to a hasty compromise on April 13 to prevent a civil war.

==Presidential council==

===Under Maga===
A presidential council, consisting of Maga, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and Apithy, was set up on May 7 with a presidency that changed every two years. Maga inaugurated this system for the first two years. Each man agreed to not use the military to extend their term or use any other means toward that consequence. If decisions were not unanimous during the first round of voting, a two councilman majority would suffice on the second round. The council served as the executive and legislative branch of Dahomey.

The cabinet was composed of four Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin allies, three Maga allies, and three allies of Apithy. Gabriel Lozes, appointed minister of finance; Theophile Paoletti, new minister of information and tourism; Edmond Doussou-Yovo, minister of education; and Karl Ahouansou, minister of communication, were all friends of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Maga&#x27;s colleagues in the cabinet were Pascal Chabi Kao, minister of finance; Albert Ouassa, minister of health; and Chabi Mama, minister of rural development; while Apithy friends were Ambroise Agboton, minister of labor; Joseph Keke, minister of economy and planning; and Michel Toko, minister of justice and guardian of the seals. Daouda Badarou, who had served as foreign minister under Zinsou, was allowed to keep his job.

Maga&#x27;s economic policies during his chairmanship helped quiet union leaders whose protests during his presidency had been intense. He helped create a tax plan that would finance their salaries by cutting expenditures and cracking down on tax evasion. In 1970 Dahomey witnessed a surplus of 429 million CFA francs, rising to a 570 million CFA franc surplus the following year. With the national economy in a favorable position, Maga and the rest of the council could afford a number of luxuries, including three houses and three Mercedes-Benz 300 automobiles to be shared amongst themselves, and festivals for the anniversary of the founding of the triumvirate.
The Council lost popularity with the Kutuklui Affair. By decree of Maga and the rest of the council, Togolese opposition leader Noe Kutuklui was officially expelled from Dahomey on October 27, 1971, where he had been practicing law since the late 1960s. It was at the request of General Etienne Eyadema, president of Togo, as Kutuklui had been involved in several plots against Eyadema&#x27;s military government. The council&#x27;s decision to extradite him spurred demonstrations in Cotonou. Maga was unable to carry out his decision; Alphonse Alley protected Kutuklui and took him to an unknown place outside of Dahomey. Col. Alley received no punishment whatsoever for his role in the Affair.

Students were some of those involved in the protests, and they soon had another reason to conflict with their government. On November 5, 1971, Maga and his administration shut down the Union Général des Etudiants et Eleves de Dahomey (UGEED), a radical youth group which sought to &quot;transform Dahomey into a battlefield&quot; using &quot;workers, soldiers, and policemen.&quot; This stemmed from UGEED-sponsored demonstrations against the minister of education when he failed to attend an educational meeting. Students whose schools followed the strike were allowed back to school on November 19, and only if their parents signed documents that said they would not participate in more demonstrations. If they failed to comply, they would be expelled from the educational system of Dahomey. Government-instituted rallies were arranged to support the ban.

The military was also aroused. The formation of a presidential council only further enraged the army. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin was ambushed while traveling to a rally in Abomey on May 7, 1971. Maga initially denied its existence, and to this day details are unclear. An artillery camp at Ouidah was the location of another military uprising on January 28, 1972. The president sent two officers to overpower the rebels although no punishment was undertaken. Both Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin and Maga believed that the latter incident was an attempted coup.

Kouandété attempted to usurp power again at dawn on February 23. When he first heard of the mutiny, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin believed that it was an attempt by Maga to remain in power. Leading the Ouidah garrison, Kouandété also attempted to take over government buildings and murder de Souza. Over the course of the operation, assailant Major Moumouni was mortally wounded by de Souza&#x27;s bullets. The plot was foiled, although Maga canceled a visit to France to attend to the matter at hand. A 12-member military commission would soon discover another plot, that would have been undertaken simultaneous to Kouandété&#x27;s. According to its findings, Captains Glele and Pierre Boni were going to follow Kouandété until de Souza was assassinated, when they would eradicate their leader and insert Zinsou back into power. The recent events epitomised the council&#x27;s &quot;fear and contempt&quot; for the military.

===Under Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin===
Maga transferred power to Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin on May 7, 1972. This was the first time in 12 years that the head of Dahomey was succeeded in a nonmilitary fashion. The new chairman congratulated Maga and praised the triumvirate as &quot;one of [Dahomey&#x27;s] most beneficial institutions.&quot; It was believed that the triumvirate would continually undermine each other, and the simple transition of power was viewed as a positive step toward Dahomeyan unity.

The Presidential Council was slow in organizing a military trial, and it did not begin until May 12. The court tried 21 men besides Kouandété, mostly military officers but also including several commoners and even Maga bodyguards. The punishments were announced on May 16. Kouandété received the death penalty, as did Captains Josué and Glélé, Quartermaster Sergeant Agboton, and a corporal and a sergeant &quot;in absentia&quot;. Lesser sentences were handed to five men who were given life imprisonment, two who would serve 20 years in prison, another with 15 years, two with ten, and two with five. An additional four were acquitted. The sentences were never carried out; the jurors believed that Kouandété would seize power in another coup.

Another delayed function of the council was the formation of the Assemblée Consultative Nationale, an advisory assembly required by the 1970 constitution. As per the constitution, such an assembly would contain 30 members advising councilmen on economic, social, and other issues, with Paul Darboux presiding. It was not established until July 1972, due to, in the words of academic Samuel Decalo, &quot;intensive horse-trading between the partners in the Presidential Council ... and pressures from their political lieutenants for a position in the Assembly.&quot;

One of the most notable aspects of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin&#x27;s time in power was the Kovacs Affair. It began with Pascal Chabi Kao being given a monopoly over selling official stationery to the Presidential Council and spread to claims of bribery and embezzlement. Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin tried to fire Chabi Kao, but Maga, who was Chabi Kao&#x27;s mentor, refused. Maga convinced Apithy to help and the bill was vetoed.
Another coup was launched by soldiers of the Ouidah garrison on October 26. This one, however, was successful, and Major Mathieu Kérékou was installed as president. It occurred during a cabinet meeting between Maga and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Kérékou had served as Maga&#x27;s aide-de-camp in 1961. According to reports at the scene, soldiers abruptly arrived in the Cabinet room of the presidential palace and started firing bullets, but no one was injured. Kérékou called the triumvirate &quot;truly a monster&quot; as it showed &quot;unpardonable incompetence&quot;, amongst other charges which were used to justify the coup. Kouandété was pardoned, although the former council was not. Maga, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and Apithy spent more than nine years in prison before being freed by Kérékou in 1981.

==Later life and death==
Maga established the National Party for Democracy and Development in 1989 and participated in the National Conference of 1990, which gave amnesty to all Beninese political refugees. He also was a member of the High Council of the Republic before retiring from political life. He did make some public appearances, such as at independence day celebrations in 1998. At the time of his death, he sat upon the Constitutional Court of Dahomey. On May 8, 2000, Maga died of a heart attack in Cotonou. A hospital in Cotonou now bears his name.

<text>In electrical engineering, an autotransformer is an electrical transformer with only one winding. The &quot;&quot; (Greek for &quot;self&quot;) prefix refers to the single coil acting alone. In an autotransformer, portions of the same winding act as both the primary winding and secondary winding sides of the transformer. In contrast, an ordinary transformer has separate primary and secondary windings that are not connected by an electrically conductive path between them.

The autotransformer winding has at least three electrical connections to the winding. Since part of the winding does &quot;double duty&quot;, autotransformers have the advantages of often being smaller, lighter, and cheaper than typical dual-winding transformers, but the disadvantage of not providing electrical isolation between primary and secondary circuits. Other advantages of autotransformers include lower leakage reactance, lower losses, lower excitation current, and increased VA rating for a given size and mass.

An example of an application of an autotransformer is one style of traveler&#x27;s voltage converter, that allows 230-volt devices to be used on 120-volt supply circuits, or the reverse. An autotransformer with multiple taps may be applied to adjust the voltage at the end of a long distribution circuit to correct for excess voltage drop; when automatically controlled, this is one example of a voltage regulator.

==Operation==

An autotransformer has a single winding with two end terminals and one or more terminals at intermediate tap points. It is a transformer in which the primary and secondary coils have part of their turns in common. The portion of the winding shared by both the primary and secondary is the common section. The portion of the winding not shared by both the primary and secondary is the series section. The primary voltage is applied across two of the terminals. The secondary voltage is taken from two terminals, one terminal of which is usually in common with a primary voltage terminal.

Since the volts-per-turn is the same in both windings, each develops a voltage in proportion to its number of turns. In an autotransformer, part of the output current flows directly from the input to the output (through the series section), and only part is transferred inductively (through the common section), allowing a smaller, lighter, cheaper core to be used as well as requiring only a single winding. However the voltage and current ratio of autotransformers can be formulated the same as other two-winding transformers:

formula_1

where formula_2.

The ampere-turns provided by the series section of the winding:

formula_3

The ampere-turns provided by the common section of the winding:

formula_4

For ampere-turn balance, formula_5:

formula_6

Therefore:

formula_7

One end of the winding is usually connected in common to both the voltage source and the electrical load. The other end of the source and load are connected to taps along the winding. Different taps on the winding correspond to different voltages, measured from the common end. In a step-down transformer the source is usually connected across the entire winding while the load is connected by a tap across only a portion of the winding. In a step-up transformer, conversely, the load is attached across the full winding while the source is connected to a tap across a portion of the winding. For a step-up transformer, the subscripts in the above equations are reversed where, in this situation, formula_8 and formula_9 are greater than formula_10 and formula_11, respectively.

As in a two-winding transformer, the ratio of secondary to primary voltages is equal to the ratio of the number of turns of the winding they connect to. For example, connecting the load between the middle of the winding and the common terminal end of the winding of the autotransformer will result in the output load voltage being 50% of the primary voltage. Depending on the application, that portion of the winding used solely in the higher-voltage (lower current) portion may be wound with wire of a smaller gauge, though the entire winding is directly connected.

If one of the center-taps is used for the ground, then the autotransformer can be used as a balun to convert a balanced line (connected to the two end taps) to an unbalanced line (the side with the ground).

An autotransformer does not provide electrical isolation between its windings as an ordinary transformer does; if the neutral side of the input is not at ground voltage, the neutral side of the output will not be either. A failure of the isolation of the windings of an autotransformer can result in full input voltage applied to the output. Also, a break in the part of the winding that is used as both primary and secondary will result in the transformer acting as an inductor in series with the load (which under light load conditions may result in nearly full input voltage being applied to the output). These are important safety considerations when deciding to use an autotransformer in a given application.

Because it requires both fewer windings and a smaller core, an autotransformer for power applications is typically lighter and less costly than a two-winding transformer, up to a voltage ratio of about 3:1; beyond that range, a two-winding transformer is usually more economical.

In three phase power transmission applications, autotransformers have the limitations of not suppressing harmonic currents and as acting as another source of ground fault currents. A large three-phase autotransformer may have a &quot;buried&quot; delta winding, not connected to the outside of the tank, to absorb some harmonic currents.

In practice, losses mean that both standard transformers and autotransformers are not perfectly reversible; one designed for stepping down a voltage will deliver slightly less voltage than required if it is used to step up. The difference is usually slight enough to allow reversal where the actual voltage level is not critical.

Like multiple-winding transformers, autotransformers use time-varying magnetic fields to transfer power. They require alternating currents to operate properly and will not function on direct current. Because the primary and secondary windings are electrically connected, an autotransformer will allow current to flow between windings and therefore does not provide AC or DC isolation.

==Applications==

===Power transmission and distribution===
Autotransformers are frequently used in power applications to interconnect systems operating at different voltage classes, for example 132 kV to 66 kV for transmission. Another application in industry is to adapt machinery built (for example) for 480 V supplies to operate on a 600 V supply. They are also often used for providing conversions between the two common domestic mains voltage bands in the world (100–130 V and 200–250 V). The links between the UK 400 kV and 275 kV &quot;Super Grid&quot; networks are normally three phase autotransformers with taps at the common neutral end. On long rural power distribution lines, special autotransformers with automatic tap-changing equipment are inserted as voltage regulators, so that customers at the far end of the line receive the same average voltage as those closer to the source. The variable ratio of the autotransformer compensates for the voltage drop along the line.

A special form of auto transformer called a &quot;zig zag&quot; is used to provide grounding on three-phase systems that otherwise have no connection to ground. A zig-zag transformer provides a path for current that is common to all three phases (so-called zero sequence current).

===Audio system ===
In audio applications, tapped autotransformers are used to adapt speakers to constant-voltage audio distribution systems, and for impedance matching such as between a low-impedance microphone and a high-impedance amplifier input.

===Railways===

In railway applications, it is common to power the trains at 25 kV AC. To increase the distance between electricity Grid feeder points, they can be arranged to supply a split-phase 25–0–25 kV feed with the third wire (opposite phase) out of reach of the train&#x27;s overhead collector pantograph. The 0 V point of the supply is connected to the rail while one 25 kV point is connected to the overhead contact wire. At frequent (about 10 km) intervals, an autotransformer links the contact wire to rail and to the second (antiphase) supply conductor. This system increases usable transmission distance, reduces induced interference into external equipment and reduces cost. A variant is occasionally seen where the supply conductor is at a different voltage to the contact wire with the autotransformer ratio modified to suit.

=== Autotransformer starter ===
Autotransformers can be used as a method of soft starting induction motors. One of the designs of such a starter is the Korndörfer autotransformer starter.

==History==

The autotransformer starter was invented in 1908, by Max Korndorfer of Berlin. He filed the application with the U.S. Patent office in May 1908 and was granted the patent US 1,096,922 in May 1914. Max Korndorfer assigned his patent to the General Electric Company.

An induction motor draws very high starting current during its acceleration to full rated speed, typically 6 to 10 times the full load current. Reduced starting current is desirable where the electrical grid is not of sufficient capacity, or where the driven load cannot withstand high starting torque. One basic method to reduce the starting current is with a reduced voltage autotransformer with taps at 50%, 65% and 80% of the applied line voltage; once the motor is started the autotransformer is switched out of circuit.

==Variable autotransformers==
By exposing part of the winding coils and making the secondary connection through a sliding brush, a continuously variable turns ratio can be obtained, allowing for very smooth control of output voltage. The output voltage is not limited to the discrete voltages represented by actual number of turns. The voltage can be smoothly varied between turns as the brush has a relatively high resistance (compared with a metal contact) and the actual output voltage is a function of the relative area of brush in contact with adjacent windings. The relatively high resistance of the brush also prevents it from acting as a short circuited turn when it contacts two adjacent turns. Typically the primary connection connects to only a part of the winding allowing the output voltage to be varied smoothly from zero to above the input voltage and thus allowing the device to be used for testing electrical equipment at the limits of its specified voltage range.

The output voltage adjustment can be manual or automatic. The manual type is applicable only for relatively low voltage and is known as a variable AC transformer (often referred to by the trademark name Variac). These are often used in repair shops for testing devices under different voltages or to simulate abnormal line voltages.

The type with automatic voltage adjustment can be used as automatic voltage regulator, to maintain a steady voltage at the customers&#x27; service during a wide range of line and load conditions. Another application is a lighting dimmer that doesn&#x27;t produce the EMI typical of most thyristor dimmers.

===Variac trademark===
From 1934 to 2002, Variac was a U.S. trademark of General Radio for a variable autotransformer intended to conveniently vary the output voltage for a steady AC input voltage. In 2004, Instrument Service Equipment applied for and obtained the &quot;Variac&quot; trademark for the same type of product. The term &quot;variac&quot; has become a genericised trademark, being used to refer to a variable autotransformer.

<doc id="1080112" wikidata="Q187664" url="?curid=1080112" title="Saint Kitts and Nevis national football team">
<text>The Saint Kitts and Nevis national football team is the national team of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and is controlled by the St. Kitts and Nevis Football Association. They are affiliated to the Caribbean Football Union of CONCACAF. The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, however, they did qualify for their first CONCACAF Gold Cup appearance in 2023.

They are nicknamed &quot;The Sugar Boyz&quot; due to the sugar cultivation on the island of St. Kitts.

==History==

===Beginnings (1938–1990)===
Saint Kitts and Nevis played their first match on 18 August 1938, against Grenada, a match that ended in a 2–4 defeat. They participated in the Leeward Islands Tournament from 1949 however had to wait until 1979 to play their first official matches, in the qualifying rounds for the 1979 CFU Championship, losing twice to Jamaica, both results finishing 2–1. They would again fail to qualify for the final phase of the 1983 CFU Championship after advancing due to Jamaica&#x27;s withdrawal, eliminated by Martinique, who won 12–0 on aggregate.

===1990–2000===
The &quot;Sugar Boyz&quot; qualified for their first tournament at the 1993 Caribbean Cup, defeating Dominican Republic (3–2) and British Virgin Islands (5–0) to top their qualifying group. In the tournament proper, they finished second behind Jamaica to reach the semi-finals, before losing to Martinique on penalties. In the match for third place, they were defeated 3–2 by Trinidad and Tobago. Saint Kitts and Nevis finished bottom of their group in 1996 but in the 1997 Caribbean Cup, they advanced into the knock-out after finishing level on points with both Trinidad and Tobago and Martinique, then defeated Grenada 2–1 in extra-time with both goals scored by Keith Gumbs, but they succumbed to Trinidad and Tobago 0–4 in the final. Since they&#x27;d reached the final, Saint Kitts and Nevis were entered into a play-off against Cuba – runner-up in the 1996 Caribbean Cup – for the last ticket to the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup, but they lost 2–0.

Saint Kitts and Nevis participated for the first time in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. After benefiting from the withdrawal of the Bahamas, they beat Saint Lucia 5–1 in Basseterre and 1–0 in Castries, but fell in the third knockout round against Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, losing thanks to the away goals rule.

===2000s===
In the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, after comfortably beating the Turks and Caicos Islands with an aggregate result of 14–0, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines once again dispatched the &quot;Sugar Boyz&quot;, winning both in Kingstown (1–0) as in Basseterre (1–2). However, the situation would improve in the 2006 qualifiers, since Saint Kitts and Nevis advanced to the second group phase after leaving the US Virgin Islands and Barbados on the way. They shared Group 3 with Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, but as expected, finished in last place, with 6 losses in as many appearances. They also experienced the worst defeat in their history, 8–0 against Mexico. In the preliminary round for the 2010 qualifiers, they were unable to repeat what they had done four years ago and were unceremoniously eliminated by Belize, who won 4–2 on aggregate.

In the Caribbean Cup, the &quot;Sugar Boyz&quot; did not repeat the successes of the &#x27;90s and could only qualify to the final phase of the 2001 Caribbean Cup, although they did not advance beyond the group phase. They have not returned to a final phase since that edition.

===2010–present===

Qualifying directly to the second round of the 2014 qualifiers, Saint Kitts and Nevis was drawn in Group D along with Canada, Puerto Rico and Saint Lucia. They finished in 3rd place, with 7 points. It was only defeated by Canada in Toronto (4–0). In the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, Saint Kitts and Nevis defeated the Turks and Caicos Islands in the first round by a lofty aggregate 12–4 before falling in the second phase, at the hands of El Salvador, 6–3 on aggregate, but not before obtaining a 2–2 draw at home. In November 2015, they played 2 friendlies against European teams, Andorra (1–0) and Estonia (0–3). Devaughn Elliott scored the only goal in the victory over Andorra, becoming the first St. Kitts and Nevis player to score against a European side. The result was also the first away victory for a CFU team over a European side on their home soil.

In October 2016, it reached its highest ranking in the FIFA world ranking (73rd place) thanks to its good performance in the 2nd round of the 2017 Caribbean Cup of Nations qualifiers. However, two defeats against French Guiana (0–1) and Haiti at home (0–2 a.e.t.) stopped the &quot;Sugar Boyz&quot; in the 3rd round of these qualifiers. The year ends with a 1–1 draw in Basseterre against Estonia on November 19, 2016, in a friendly match, one year after playing against the same team in Tallinn.

In June 2017, the team went on a second European tour and played Armenia on June 4 in Yerevan and Georgia three days later in Tbilisi. Both games ended in equally bad losses, 5–0 and 3–0, respectively. St. Kitts and Nevis continues its pattern of international tours and travels in August 2017 to Mumbai to meet Mauritius and India in a friendly tournament, the 2017 Hero Tri-Nation Series. Both matches ended in draws acquired by the same score of one goal each.

The &quot;Sugar Boyz&quot; played Andorra again on March 25, 2022, six and a half years after their first confrontation, for a friendly match in Andorra la Vella. This time the Principality&#x27;s selection wins against Saint Kitts and Nevis on its home stadium (1–0).

They qualified for their first ever CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2023.

<text>Hopton Heath, or Hoptonheath, is a hamlet in south Shropshire, England. The border with Herefordshire is close by. It lies on the border of the civil parishes of Clungunford and Hopton Castle.

There is a railway station here - Hopton Heath railway station - which today is little more than a halt on the Heart of Wales Line. The hamlet grew as a result of the railway station&#x27;s construction (in 1861) — it was built to serve the villages of Hopton Castle and Clungunford. Today, a couple of small businesses operate from units near the station and there is also a site of holiday lodges, called &quot;Ashlea Pools&quot;.

The B4367 and B4385 roads intersect at Hopton Heath. One mile to the west is the village (and castle) of Hopton Castle, and also nearby are the villages of Bedstone, Clungunford and the hamlets of Beckjay, Broadward, Heath (Herefordshire) and Abcott - with its &quot;Rocke Cottage&quot; (was &quot;Bird on the Rock&quot;) tea rooms. The &quot;740&quot; bus service calls at Hopton Heath, with three buses a day to Ludlow and Knighton.

There is a Royal Mail post box at the junction of the B roads.

<doc id="1080123" wikidata="Q1549202" url="?curid=1080123" title="Messer (sword)">
<text>A messer (German for &quot;knife&quot;) is a single-edged sword of the 15th and 16th century, characterised by knife-like hilt construction methods. 

While the various names are often used synonymously, messers can be divided into several principal groups:

A &quot;Bauernwehr&quot; (&quot;peasant&#x27;s knife&quot; or &quot;peasant&#x27;s sidearm&quot;) or &quot;Hauswehr&quot; (&quot;home/household knife&quot;) is a single-handed knife, used for utility and defence. Typical blade lengths range from lengths up to around .
&quot;Messer&quot;, &quot;Langes Messer&quot;, and &quot;Großes Messer&quot; (&quot;knife&quot;, &quot;long knife&quot;, and &quot;great knife&quot; respectively) are usually single-handed swords used for self-defence. These blade lengths ranged from about to . Hilts are normally suited to single handed use, but the larger examples may feature extended grips suitable for a second hand-hold. 

&quot;Kriegsmesser&quot; (&quot;war knife&quot;) are the largest examples of messer-hilted weapons, ranging from around long with approximately blade, up to around long with blades up to in length. Designed to be used with both hands, such messers were dedicated military arms, normally wielded by professional soldiers during the 15th and 16th century, such as the Landsknecht.

These names are subjective, and there are no known texts which clearly codify the differences between groups. As such, A large Bauernwehr might well have also been called a Messer, or a large Großes Messer might have been called a Kriegsmesser.

== Typology ==
To combat the inherent uncertainties in using the period terms like &quot;Messer&quot;, &quot;langes Messer&quot;, and &quot;Großes Messer&quot; which are sometimes interchangeable, there is a typology created by James G. Elmslie for European single-edged arms, which classifies messer and falchion forms, similar to the Oakeshott typology used for double-edged arming swords. For more information see Elmslie Typology.

== Origin and geography ==
Messer appear to have emerged in the region of Southern Germany, Switzerland, or Northern Austria in the first few years of the 15th century, as small and civilian knives of low social status. As such their exact date of origin is uncertain, the earliest known depiction being from around 1430. Those knives grow steadily larger, and depictions of sword-sized messer are found by the end of the 1440s in . 

While the name &quot;messer&quot; is German, messer hilted arms have been found in multiple European nations, with local or regional names. Examples of messer are found in the Netherlands and Northern France, Iceland, Sweden, and the Baltic Nations, in the central European nations of Poland, Czechia, Hungary and Romania, and to the south of Germany in Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, and northern parts of the Balkan nations.

The geographical spread of messers can be traced from known centres of manufacture in areas like Passau and Solingen, through medieval river trade routes, and the shipping networks of the Hanseatic League. As such, It is most likely that very similar messer hilts found in for example, Iceland, northern Germany, and northern Poland are evidence of export of Passau blades during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, rather than examples of indigenous manufacture.

== Construction ==
Messer are characterized by single-edged blades mounted on knife-like hilts. The lengths and shape of blades can vary greatly, with straight or curved profiles, broad or narrow blades, and presence or absence of fullers. Extant examples of langes messer seem to have an overall length of with a blade, and a weight between .

The principal feature of the messer is its hilt construction, which is usually different to that of contemporary European swords. Most messer are assembled with the hilt consisting of a slab tang sandwiched between two wooden grip plates which are pinned or riveted into place. 

Messer usually feature a &quot;Nagel&quot;: a nail-like protrusion which projects out from the right side of the cross-guard perpendicular to the flat of the blade, which protects the knuckles of the wielder&#x27;s hand from injury. On the smallest messers and most bauernwehr the nagel is usually driven through the wooden grips of the hilt. On larger messer, a steel cross-guard is normally found, and the nagel is slotted through a hole in the centre of the cross-guard. The length of the hilt is normally proportionate to the length of the blade, with longer blades featuring hilts long enough to enable gripping with both hands.
While the majority of messer hilts are constructed of wood, a small proportion of extant examples exhibit hilts of other materials - horn, bone, or leather-covered wood. A smaller section yet display highly complex hilt construction techniques, using metal frame construction containing organic panels, such as exotic wood and mother-of pearl, or chequerboard patterns constructed from bone and dark horn. 

Messer do not normally feature pommels like contemporary two-edged swords. Instead, those which have a metal pommel tend to feature asymmetrical profiles which curve down towards the edged side of the blade - a feature which is sometimes called a &quot;Hat shape&quot;, or a &quot;bird&#x27;s beak&quot; pommel. Some examples terminate in ovoid metal caps which form a flat face, and some have no metal terminal at all, instead being plain wood, or leather-covered wood. 

Messer hilt construction techniques develop over time, and in the 16th century, sometimes begin to match contemporary two-edged sword construction methods, to the point that it is difficult to differentiate between the two groups. 

==Fighting with the messer==
The &quot;messer&quot; was part of the curriculum of several &quot;Fechtbücher&quot; (fighting manuals) of the 14th and 15th centuries, including that of Johannes Lecküchner (dealing with the &quot;langes messer&quot;), the &quot;Codex Wallerstein&quot;, Hans Talhoffer, Paulus Kal and Albrecht Dürer.

<text>Lankhor was a French video game developer based in Clamart, France. The company was founded in 1987 by Jean-Luc Langlois and Kyilkohr. Lankhor was known for developing &quot;Mortville Manor&quot;, the first video game to feature speech synthesis during gameplay.

In 1998, the company won the award for the Best French Company by the magazine Génération 4.

== History ==
Lankhor was founded in 1987 as a result of the merger between Kyilkohr creations and Béatrice &amp; Jean-Luc Langlois. Lankhor gained fame with productions such as the arcade game &quot;Wanderer&quot; (1987) by the Langlois siblings and, above all, the adventure games &quot;Mortville Manor&quot; and &quot;Maupiti Island&quot;. &quot;Mortevielle&quot; by Gourier and Bernard Grélaud was published for the first time in 1986 on the Sinclair QL platform, but in the refreshed version of Lankhor (with a new title board and speech synthesizer) was successful a significant commercial success, repeated by &quot;Maupiti Island&quot;. Another commercial success for Lankhor was the racing game &quot;Vroom&quot;, simulating the competition during Formula 1. &quot;Mortevielle&quot;, &quot;Maupiti Island&quot; and &quot;Vroom&quot; were awarded Tilt d&#x27;Or statuettes, awarded by the industry magazine Tilt.

From 1994, the company abandoned its publishing activities to devote itself solely to development. At the beginning of 1996, Daniel Macré having joined Jean-Luc Langlois in the company management, signed a development contract for Formula 1 games under FIA license with the British publisher Eidos Interactive. In 2000, Lankhor was developing video games for Microïds including &quot;Ski Park Manager&quot; which was released in 2002. The company however experienced a difficult financial situation which started at the end of the same year; this situation led the company to cancel its contract with Video System, a Japanese video game distribution house. At the end of 2001, Lankhor announced its closure which came to pass on October 3, 2002.

<text>The battle of Hopton Heath was a part of the First English Civil War, fought on Sunday 19 March 1643 between Parliamentarian forces led by Sir John Gell and Sir William Brereton and a Royalist force under Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton.

==Background==
On 6 March 1643, Sir John Gell successfully captured the town of Lichfield in Staffordshire. Gell then decided that he would attack the Royalist stronghold at Stafford which protected the Royalist&#x27;s supply route between the ports of Yorkshire and their capital at Oxford. To capture such a garrison, however, Gell would need reinforcements and therefore he arranged to meet and combine forces with the cavalry of Cheshire commander Sir William Brereton. The two Parliamentary leaders decided to meet at Hopton Heath on the 19th of the month. Meanwhile King Charles had sent an expeditionary force under the command of the Earl of Northampton on a mission to take control of the West Midlands and Staffordshire. Northampton had joined forces with Royalist allies led by Henry Hastings at Tamworth and on 18 March they arrived at Stafford.

==Battle==
On the morning of 19 March, Gell arrived at Hopton Heath. The Royalist forces became aware of the presence of the Parliamentarians mid-morning and shortly thereafter they began their preparations to advance to Hopton Heath. At 14:00 hours, Brereton arrived at the heath. The Parliamentarians took a position along a ridge on the northeast side of the field. In total, the Parliamentarian forces consisted of 1400 men including 700 infantry, 300 dragoons, and 400 cavalry.

At 15:00 hours, the Royalists arrived and deployed in battle formation to the south of the Parliamentarians. Their combined forces consisted of 1200 men including 300 dragoons and 800 cavalry. Hastings led the initial attack with his dragoons and was successful at pushing the Parliamentarians back at the edges. An exchange of artillery fire began with the Royalists doing the most harm with their large 29-pounder known as &quot;Roaring Meg.&quot;

Northampton then led two cavalry charges aimed at the Parliamentarians&#x27; centre. Each time his attack was repulsed. On the second charge, Northampton was thrown from his horse into the Parliamentarian line where he was killed after refusing quarter. The Royalists regrouped and Sir Thomas Byron led a third charge against the Parliamentarians, but to no avail. Hastings tried to rally the Royalists for a fourth charge, but their energy was spent. At that time Brereton led a Parliamentarian infantry attack and pushed the Royalists back recapturing some of the field and artillery that had earlier been lost.

At dusk the fighting ended and the Parliamentarians left the field. The battle was over, not to be resumed. Brereton returned to his headquarters in Cheshire and Gell left for Derby abandoning the attempt to capture Stafford. Because of the nature of the cavalry charges against a Parliamentary force composed largely of infantry, the casualties were heavily one-sided; the Parliamentarians had 500 casualties as compared to 50 killed or wounded Royalists.

==Aftermath==
After the battle, both sides claimed victory. The Parliamentarians believed they had won in that they held the field at the end of the day and had killed the Royalists&#x27; commander, the Earl of Northampton. The Royalists believed that they had won the battle in that they reoccupied the field the next morning and had captured eight artillery pieces.

With respect to the control of Staffordshire, Stafford was now free of Parliamentarian threat. Henry Hastings and the Royalists immediately tried to retake Lichfield and its strongly defended Close on 21 March, but failed. Two weeks later, Prince Rupert entered Lichfield and surrounded the Close. On 21 April Colonel Russell and the Parliamentarian garrison surrendered. Lichfield would then remain a Royalist stronghold for the duration of the Civil War.

<text>The Río Tinto (, &quot; river&quot; or Tinto River) is a highly toxic river in southwestern Spain that rises in the Sierra Morena mountains of Andalusia. It flows generally south-southwest, reaching the Gulf of Cádiz at Huelva. The Rio Tinto river has a unique red and orange colour derived from its chemical makeup that is extremely acidic and with very high levels of iron and heavy metals.

The river maintains its colour for an approximate length of 50 kilometres. After the 50 kilometre mark, the chemistry that makes the Rio Tinto river so unique appears to slowly decline, as does the odd colouring. The location where the chemistry of the river is altered is near the town of Niebla. The river&#x27;s chemistry begins to significantly change following the town of Niebla as the Rio Tinto blends itself with other streams that are connected to the Atlantic Ocean. The river is approximately long and is located within the Iberian Pyrite Belt. This area has large amounts of ore and sulphide deposits.

The Rio Tinto area has been the site of approximately 5,000 years of ore mining, including copper, silver, gold, and other minerals, extracted as far as 20 kilometres from the river shores. As a possible result of the mining, the Río Tinto is notable for being very acidic (pH 2) and its deep reddish hue is due to iron dissolved in the water. Acid mine drainage from the mines leads to severe environmental problems because the acidity (low pH) dissolves heavy metals into the water. It is not clear how much acid drainage has come from natural processes and how much has come from mining. There are severe environmental concerns over the pollution in the river.

Although the river represents a harsh environment for life, some microorganisms classified as extremophiles do thrive in these conditions. Such life forms include certain species of bacteria, algae and heterotrophs.

==History==

The ore body was deposited during the Carboniferous period (300–350 Ma) by hydrothermal activities on the sea floor. The history of mining in the Rio Tinto area traces back to the Tartessans and the Iberians starting mining in 3000 BC, followed by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors. The Rio Tinto region has been the source of approximately 5,000 years of ore extraction, and chemical refinement primarily for copper, silver and gold, and later for iron, manganese and other minerals. This long standing mining activity has vastly modified the topography of the region.

After a period of abandonment and disuse, the mines were rediscovered in 1556 and the Spanish government began operating them once again in 1724. In the 19th century, companies from the United Kingdom started large-scale mining operations. In 1873, the Rio Tinto Company was formed to operate the mines. Production declined after the peak of production in 1930, and it ended in 1986 for copper mining and in 1996 for silver and gold mining. All mining ended in 2001.

Increased copper prices in the 2010s led to efforts by EMED Mining to reopen the mine, but difficulties in acquiring all necessary property rights, environmental concerns, and obtaining regulatory approval delayed reopening. The mine, which employed as many as 20,000 in the past, would employ 350 people during its startup phase. Environmental concerns are centred on long disused water reservoirs which might not be able to withstand the stress of renewed waste inputs.

== Origin and ecology ==
Due to the extreme conditions of the river, there is very little in the way of life, with the exception of small amounts of microorganisms, including algae. The presence of anaerobic bacteria in the sediments is thought to contribute somewhat to the river&#x27;s famously low pH (acidity), that in turn increases the concentration of dissolved heavy metals. The waters from the Rio Tinto, high in metal sulphides, provide an ideal environment for chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, with the sulphides acting as a food source. The product of metal sulphide metabolism through oxidization is ferric iron and secretion of acidic liquid. 

The continuation of this process for an extended period of time is thought by some scientists to be responsible for keeping the river&#x27;s pH between 2 and 2.5 in most areas. Even in the extremely acidic water, both red and green algae have been observed to thrive in relatively high concentrations. Despite algae levels in the Rio Tinto accounting for over half of the total biomass in the river, algae is understood to have minimal effects on the characteristics of the complex ecosystem.

The discovery of multiple oxide terraces mediated by microorganisms at up to 60 metres above the current water level, and as far away as 20 kilometres from the current river&#x27;s path, may suggest that the unusual ecosystem is a natural phenomenon since before human mining activities started in this region. On the other hand, it is known that toxic water emanates from these vast underground and open pit mines and chemical ore refinement that had been active off and on for thousands of years. While it is still undetermined if the unique water chemistry of the Rio Tinto developed as a result of thousands of years of mining or by natural causes, it is possible that the river&#x27;s chemical makeup is due to the combination of both natural causes and acid mine drainage. The river drains an area with huge deposits of sulphides which was formed more than 350 million years ago. When sulphides are exposed to air, water, and microorganisms, drainage from acidic rocks flows into surface and ground water. Mining, however, greatly increases exposed areas.

==Astrobiology==
This river has gained recent scientific interest due to the presence of extremophile anaerobic bacteria that dwell in the acidic water. The subsurface rocks on the river bed contain iron and sulphide minerals on which the bacteria feed. The extreme conditions in the river may be analogous to other locations in the Solar System thought to contain liquid water, such as groundwater on Mars. Scientists have also directly compared the chemistry of the water in which the Mars rocks of Meridiani Planum were deposited in the past with the Río Tinto. Likewise, the moon Europa contains an acidic ocean of water underneath its ice surface, thus the Rio Tinto river is of interest to astrobiologists studying the environmental limits of life and planetary habitability.

<text>Panagiotis &quot;Taki&quot; Theodoracopulos (; ; born 11 August 1936) is a Greek writer and publisher who founded &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and co-founded &quot;The American Conservative&quot;. His column &quot;High Life&quot; appeared in British weekly &quot;The Spectator&quot; from 1977 to 2023. He has lived in New York City, London, and Gstaad.

==Early life and education==
The son of a Greek shipping magnate, Theodoracopulos was privately educated in the United States at Lawrenceville School and Blair Academy before attending the University of Virginia.

Theodoracopulos was a sportsman early in life. He represented Greece at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1962, having been a tennis player beforehand, including playing at the 1961 French Championship.

==Career==
Theodoracopulos&#x27;s column &quot;High Life&quot; has appeared in British weekly &quot;The Spectator&quot; since 1977, where he wrote a series of controversial articles, including one claiming that black people had lower IQs than other people, for which Boris Johnson, made editor in 1999, later apologised. He has also written for other US and UK publications, including &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Hamptons Magazine&quot;, &quot;Newsweek,&quot; the &quot;New York Press&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times,&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot; 

In 1984, Theodoracopulos was arrested for the possession of cocaine, after attempting to board a plane at Heathrow Airport, and served three months in HMP Pentonville. He documented his prison experiences in &quot;Nothing to Declare: Prison Memoirs&quot; (1991) and discussed them in an extended appearance on the British television programme &quot;After Dark&quot;.

In 2002, Theodoracopulos founded &quot;The American Conservative&quot; magazine with Pat Buchanan and Scott McConnell. He was also the publisher of the British magazine &quot;Right Now!&quot; He currently publishes and writes for &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 2016, the organization Proud Boys was launched with an article in &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot; by Gavin McInnes.

Theodoracopulos appeared in the 2013 James Toback film &quot;Seduced and Abandoned&quot; as himself.

He received criticism for writing in support of the Greek far-right political party Golden Dawn, describing them as &quot;good old-fashioned patriotic Greeks&quot; in a 2013 editorial. The editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Fraser Nelson, defended Theodoracopulos by tweeting that &quot;Our readers like diversity and well-written pieces that they disagree with. We have no party line.&quot; In a 2021 interview, months after many Golden Dawn leaders were convicted by Greek courts for heading a criminal organisation, the chairman of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Andrew Neil, who does not have influence over the magazine editorially, condemned the column, stating it was &quot;beyond the pale&quot;. He further added that he had requested the editor to inform Theodoracopulos that he should not return to that topic following its publication.

His frequent criticism of Israel led Conrad Black to accuse him of antisemitism. In 2018, he wrote an article commemorating D-Day in which he praised the Wehrmacht and asked readers to sympathize with them.

==Racism==

In 2004, &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticised Theodoracopulos for expressing racist views directed against West Indians, Puerto Ricans, and Jews, among others. He has used the racial epithets &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;Sambo&quot; to describe black people and he referred to Saudi royal family members as &quot;ruling towelheads&quot;.

== Attempted rape conviction ==
On 5 October 2023, Theodoracopulos received a 12-month suspended sentence for an attempted rape that occurred in 2009 in his chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland. His lawyer indicated that he would appeal the verdict by a Swiss court.

==Personal life==
Theodoracopulos has an interest in Asian martial arts, and holds a black belt in karate. He owned a 37.5-metre yacht named &quot;Bushido&quot; that was put up for sale in 2012.

<doc id="1080147" wikidata="Q7614410" url="?curid=1080147" title="Steven Jesse Bernstein">
<text>Steven Jay &quot;Jesse&quot; Bernstein (December 4, 1950 – October 22, 1991) was an American underground writer and performance artist. He remains famous for his recordings with Sub Pop records and close relationship with William S. Burroughs. Bernstein&#x27;s substance abuse issues and mental illness contributed to his provocative local celebrity, though they ultimately culminated in his suicide.

==History==
Bernstein was born in Los Angeles, California. His substance abuse issues began as the aftermath of his stay in the Camarillo State Hospital in Camarillo, California as an adolescent. He moved to Seattle, Washington in January 1967, where he adopted the moniker Jesse, and began performing and self-publishing chapbooks of his poetry, the first of which was &quot;Choking On Sixth&quot;, 1979). Bernstein would become something of an icon to many in Seattle&#x27;s underground music scene. Notable fans included Kurt Cobain and Oliver Stone.
Though often noted for his connection to grunge and punk rock, Bernstein saw himself primarily as a poet and his live performances in Seattle, such as his regular readings at the Dogtown Poetry Theater and Red Sky Poetry Theatre, were influential in Seattle, and he is credited as a major influence by many local poets from his era.

Bernstein&#x27;s mental illness was not as alarming as it might have been off the stage, as his drug-reinforced manic episodes were harnessed and channeled into engrossing, often perverse, entertainment. He opened for music acts such as Nirvana, Big Black, Soundgarden, U-Men, and Cows. According to Regina Hackett, art critic for the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;:

Some of Bernstein&#x27;s bizarre on-stage antics were fueled by alcohol and some (like the performance with a mouse), were deliberate. Bernstein was clean and sober from 1981 to 1990, despite the ravages of bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.

The concept for the Bernstein album &quot;Prison&quot; was for Jesse to do a raw live performance at the State Penitentiary Special Offenders unit in Monroe, Washington in 1991. Jesse went with his manager Barbara Buckland, Bruce Pavitt from Sub Pop Records, Grant Alden (then a writer for &quot;Rocket&quot; magazine and later the co-founder of &quot;No Depression&quot; magazine), photographer Arthur S. Aubry, and various technical assistance people. None of the session except for the photos taken by Aubry was usable. Sub Pop later contracted Steve Fisk to finish the project. The album was intended to be produced along the same lines as Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot;, but Fisk later decided to score a collection of other Bernstein&#x27;s recordings with jazz and ambient music, as Bernstein&#x27;s performance at Monroe was too poor to be released. The album was not completed by the time of Bernstein&#x27;s death.

On October 22, 1991, at the age of 40, Bernstein committed suicide by stabbing himself in the throat while visiting friends in Neah Bay, Washington, although not simultaneously.

&quot;Prison&quot; was released on April 1, 1992. In 1994, one of these recordings, &quot;Me and Her Outside (No No Man),&quot; was used in the film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;.

&quot;I Am Secretly an Important Man&quot;, a collection of poetry, short stories, and spoken performances, was released in March 1996 by Zero Hour Publishing.

His song &quot;A Little Bit of Everything (That Brought Me Down to This)&quot;, from the Trigger Recordings album, &quot;The Sad Bag&quot;, was also included on the two-CD set &quot;Home Alive&quot;, the proceeds from which benefited women&#x27;s self-defense groups in the Seattle area.

In 2010, filmmaker Peter Sillen released a documentary on Bernstein, &quot;I Am Secretly An Important Man&quot;.

<doc id="1080154" wikidata="Q4727157" url="?curid=1080154" title="Murder of Alison Parrott">
<text>Alison May Campbell Parrott (September 28, 1974July 25, 1986) was an 11-year-old Canadian girl who was lured out of her home by a male phone caller in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Her remains were found two days later in a densely wooded area of Kings Mill Park in Etobicoke.

A decade later, a link analysis helped Toronto homicide detectives match the DNA evidence with a man who was charged with the crime. Francis Carl Roy was convicted of first-degree murder on April 13, 1999. Sentenced to life in prison, he has been eligible for parole since 2021.

==Early life==
Alison May Campbell Parrott was born on September 28, 1974, in Toronto. Her father, Peter Parrott, was a civil engineer, and her mother, Lesley, was an advertising executive. At the time of her murder, Alison was attending a French immersion elementary school and frequently used public transit. She was also an avid runner and a member of the Tom Longboat track-and-field club for youth aged 8 to 12. She had won her first race in the summer of 1986, qualifying for the International Youth Track Championships, a youth track-and-field meet to be held in New Jersey on August 1. Her name, along with those of other Toronto qualifiers, was published in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

==Disappearance==
Shortly before 11 o&#x27;clock on the morning of July 25, 1986, Parott received a phone call at her Summerhill Avenue home in midtown Toronto. A male caller, claiming to be a photographer, asked her to meet him at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Varsity Stadium where, he said, he would be taking publicity photos of her and her teammates. Alison had trained at the Varsity Stadium sports field the previous fall. No one else was at home when Alison received the call. Alison phoned her mother at work and received permission to attend the photo session. They discussed the route she would take and arranged that she would return home by 2:30 pm. Riders reported seeing her alone on her 20-minute subway route. When Alison failed to return on time, her parents waited until 5 pm to begin inquiring among their friends and neighbours as to her whereabouts. At 6 pm, they called police. Hundreds joined the search in the following days. Parott&#x27;s body was found two days later by two boys walking in a densely wooded area of Kings Mill Park, on the Humber River just below the Old Mill subway station; she had been bound, raped, and strangled.

Alison&#x27;s remains were cremated. Her gravesite is located in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto. A green space south of David A. Balfour Park, dubbed &quot;The Little Park&quot;, is dedicated to Parott.

==Investigation==
Police announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the murderer. The investigation initially interviewed 18,000 persons. According to police, the perpetrator had tracked Alison&#x27;s movements in the weeks leading up to the murder. On July 14, an unidentified male caller had phoned at the house asking to speak to her, but she was out at summer camp and the babysitter had taken a message. The caller had apparently phoned other families with the surname of Parrott in an effort to locate &quot;the Alison Parrott who was going to the International Youth Track Championships in New Jersey&quot;. Police speculated that the murderer may have also gathered information about Alison&#x27;s training patterns at her club.

For a time, police suspected the culprit was a man they sought and called the Scarborough Rapist. When he was identified as Paul Bernardo, the police knew they needed another man because DNA gathered from traces of semen found on Alison&#x27;s clothes did not match.

==Suspect==
Francis Carl Roy (born September 18, 1957) was questioned by police during their first round of interviews, as he used the same training facility as Alison&#x27;s track club, and also because he had a criminal record. Roy was a First Nations man from Manitoulin Island. He was an avid runner with a keen interest in photography and had a criminal record dating back to 1976, including possession of stolen property, petty theft, fraud, assault, breaking and entering, and rape. At the time of Alison&#x27;s murder, Roy had been on parole after serving only two and a half years of a consecutive 11-year sentence for the rapes of a 14-year-old girl and 19-year-old woman. He moved to Vancouver in 1988 and obtained a job with the city as a youth counselor, claiming to have a degree in psychology from the University of Toronto. He got the job without a background check. After being involved in a bar fight in 1991, he returned to Toronto.

Roy told investigators that he had gone running and then met a friend at a bar at the time of Alison&#x27;s disappearance. Moreover, when Alison&#x27;s body was found in July 27, Roy appeared at the police station to confess to assaulting a 20-year-old woman in his apartment two days earlier. In October he pled guilty to this assault and was fined $200, plus the five weeks he had spent in jail.

In 1989, suspicion again fell on Roy when a man arrested in Vancouver informed police that they should consider Roy a suspect in the murders of sex workers in that city earlier that year. Roy was never charged with those crimes, but the two Vancouver officers who had been tipped off did not forget what they were told. In 1996, they gave their information to the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS) link analysis database and detectives in Toronto&#x27;s homicide division picked up the file as part of a cold cases review. Reading over the initial police interview and other reports from Roy&#x27;s parole officer, they were struck by inconsistencies and deceptions in the suspect&#x27;s story. The division put a tail on Roy, its officers collecting his DNA from used cigarette butts and a coffee cup in Toronto bars and making a positive match with the DNA found on semen in Alison&#x27;s body. On July 31, 1996, just over a decade after Alison&#x27;s murder, Roy was arrested.

==Trial==
Fearing that the jury would be prejudiced if they possessed certain knowledge about Roy, precluding his right to a fair trial, the trial judge in Roy&#x27;s case chose not to make it available to the jury, citing a 1988 decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in the process. The withheld evidence included Roy&#x27;s previous two convictions for rape, the fact that both rapes had been committed on teenagers, and that one of the victims was &quot;tricked, abducted and bound, much like Alison&quot;.

===Defence===
Three witnesses testified that they had seen Alison in the company of a white man on the morning of her disappearance.

The defence asserted that Roy was not intelligent enough to have committed the crime. Roy&#x27;s only explanation for the DNA evidence – which matched his semen to that found in Alison&#x27;s vagina – was that he had discovered Alison&#x27;s naked body while looking for a place to urinate while on a run in the park. He claimed to have had a sudden urge to stick his finger inside her. Since he had masturbated earlier that day, he said, he still had semen on his fingers.

===Verdict===
After a month-long trial and six days of deliberation, on April 13, 1999, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder. Roy was sentenced to automatic life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 25 years.

In 2003, the Court of Appeal for Ontario rejected an appeal by Roy, who claimed that police at his interrogation had denied him his right to remain silent.

==&quot;Stay Alert ... Stay Safe&quot;==
In May 1987, Lesley Parrott, aided by colleagues at the advertising agency where she worked, launched the Canada-wide &quot;Stay Alert ... Stay Safe&quot; program. Aimed at children aged seven through ten, the program&#x27;s main objective was to attune children&#x27;s instincts to dangerous situations, whether at home or elsewhere.

Both Alison and her younger brother had attended an all-day &quot;streetproofing&quot; seminar the year before her murder, in which young children receive instruction on how to &quot;avoid potential molesters and abductors&quot;.

==Documentaries==
The fourth episode of season 1 of &quot;Cold Case Files&quot;, titled &quot;Answer in the Box; Maternal Instinct&quot; (1999), follows the disappearance of Alison and subsequent investigation of the crime.

&quot;Killer in a Box&quot; (1999) was the second episode of season 3 of &quot;Exhibit A: Secrets of Forensic Science&quot;, a Canadian documentary television program, hosted by Graham Greene, that revisited criminal cases.

Parrott&#x27;s murder was one of the cases examined in the 2007 documentary &quot;Forgiveness: Stories For Our Time&quot;.

<text>Vessem is a village in the southern Netherlands. It is located in the municipality of Eersel, North Brabant. Cultural attractions include the windmill and several galleries.

The village was first mentioned in 1245 as Veseme. The etymology is unclear. Vessem is a church village which developed on a sandy ridge along the Kleine Beerze.

Vessem was home to 581 people in 1840. It used to part of the municipality of Vessem, Wintelre en Knegsel until 1996 when it was merged into Eersel.

== Sights ==

* Old Town Hall from 1898 with a memorial stone commemorating the inauguration of Queen Wilhelmina in the same year. It is a symmetrical white building with a stepped gable.
* The family-owned brewery &#x27;De Leeuw&#x27; is redbrick factory building with a tall chimney dominating the central street. The brewery now produces Beerze beer. The premises burnt down in 1904 but was rebuilt in 1905. It was restored again in 2008, expanding to include a restaurant, hotel accommodation, meeting rooms, and a courtyard garden. It now regularly hosts weddings. 
* The Catholic St. Lambertus Church was a 15th-century tower, and the church was added between 1882 and 1883. 
* The grist mill Jacobus was built in 1893. It was restored in 1969 and 1986. The wind mill is technically operational, however a large beech tree prevents the wheel from turning.

<doc id="1080173" wikidata="Q383576" url="?curid=1080173" title="Nipple piercing">
<text>A nipple piercing is a type of body piercing, centered usually at the base of the nipple. It can be pierced at any angle but is usually done horizontally or, less often, vertically. It is also possible to place multiple piercings on top of one another.

== History ==

The perforation of the nipple to apply jewelry has been practiced by various people throughout history. Male nipple piercing was reported to be done by the Karankawa Native Americans. Female nipple piercing is practiced by the Kabyle people in Algeria.

In the western world it potentially dates back to the 14th century. The anthropologist Hans Peter Duerr traces the earliest known practice of female nipple piercing as a fashion statement to the Court of Isabeau of Bavaria (1370 to 1435), queen consort of France, quoting Eduard Fuchs he describes that: However, these sources are difficult to verify.

There are also references to a fashion for nipple piercing among society women during the Victorian era around 1890. However, the historian Lesley Hall has commented that these can be traced to a few letters published in the magazine &quot;Society&quot; during 1899, and can be judged as erotic fantasies rather than descriptions of actual activity.

In the late 1970s, the practice was revived by Jim Ward and it was adopted by the BDSM and leather subcultures of the gay community. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the modern primitive movement embraced nipple piercings among other forms of body modification. With its roots in the West Coast of the United States, the modern primitive movement was intrigued by indigenous, so-called &quot;primitive&quot; cultures and adopted various forms of body modification. The mainstream popularity of nipple piercing is partly due to certain 1990s celebrities such as Tommy Lee, Corey Taylor and Lenny Kravitz who publicly displayed their piercings or said that they had them.

Nipple piercing has gained in popularity in the 21st century with a number of celebrities and fashion models having this type of piercing. In addition, many people are motivated to have nipple piercings for personal reasons including self-expression and a desire to feel unique. At least one study has shown that people spend, on average, 1–2 years making the decision to have a piercing.

==Sensitivity==

Sexual arousal created by areola and nipple stimulation is reported to be enhanced by piercing of the nipple. Many women say that they have experienced an increase in sensitivity and arousal after having their nipples pierced. As a result of a surge of information claiming sexual enhancement with a pierced nipple, there has been a reported increase of men and women requesting this procedure. This does not apply for all those who have undergone the procedure, with some reporting a decrease in sensitivity or no change at all.

==Breastfeeding==
A common question among women who consider nipple piercings is how it may affect breastfeeding. There is no evidence to suggest that proper nipple piercings can cause any complications with lactation. A letter in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; suggests improperly pierced nipples and scarring may result in blocked ducts.

It is recommended that good care be taken to prevent infection by using a piercing professional and good body piercing aftercare. Frequent re-piercings can also damage the nipple and cause complications. It is also recommended that the piercing be healed before breastfeeding. Most body piercing professionals will refuse to pierce a pregnant woman for this reason and because piercing causes stress on the body that could potentially complicate a pregnancy.

Several complications have been noted involving breastfeeding with a piercing present, so it is recommended to remove nipple jewelry before nursing. Several complications resulting from nursing with nipple jewelry inserted can include poor latch, slurping, gagging, and milk leaking from the baby&#x27;s mouth.

It can also be a potential choking hazard for the baby. As the baby sucks, the ends on a barbell (if worn) may come loose and could possibly lodge in the baby&#x27;s throat (a captive bead ring, properly inserted, would lessen the risk of anything becoming loose, falling out, and lodging in the throat). The baby&#x27;s gums and tongue as well as the soft and hard palate could be injured by the jewelry.

Some lactation consultants say that nipple piercings should not affect the ability to breastfeed but no clinical studies have been carried out on the subject. The suggested risks include pain while breastfeeding, reduced or diverted milk flow, and the infection of blocked lactiferous ducts.

== Inverted nipples ==

Inverted nipples are primarily a cosmetic problem but might interfere with breastfeeding. Nipples that are inverted can be pierced; in fact, it has been proposed as a corrective strategy to protract the nipple.

==Potential complications==
The nipple is fleshy enough to pierce securely behind plenty of skin to prevent rejection. However, if the jewelry gauge is too thin or the piercing is not deep enough to begin with, there is a risk of rejection. Metal allergies, infections, or excessive pulling/tugging can also cause the piercing to be rejected.

Death due to complications resulting from nipple piercings may have occurred, as have serious infections resulting in the removal of a breast after getting a nipple ring, but typically, a nipple piercing will take at least six months to a year for women or two to four months for men to heal fully.

There is an increased risk of nonpuerperal mastitis occurring in the months after nipple piercing.

==Notable wearers==
A nipple piercing gained considerable media attention after Super Bowl XXXVIII, during which Justin Timberlake accidentally exposed Janet Jackson&#x27;s right breast on which she had a nipple shield applied to a piercing. This incident is called Nipplegate. Nicole Richie set off an alarm at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport as she passed a metal detector with her nipple piercing. Pink had her nipple pierced backstage after a concert she was giving in Germany in the presence of her mother. The whole scene was filmed and later published on her DVD &quot;&quot;. Christina Aguilera had all her piercings removed except for her right nipple piercing. Pop singer Rihanna had her nipple piercing exposed first in the same way and later in a &quot;Lui&quot; magazine pictorial.

<text>The Nelson Monument is a commemorative tower in honour of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, located in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is situated on top of Calton Hill, and provides a dramatic termination to the vista along Princes Street from the west. The monument was built between 1807 and 1816 to commemorate Nelson&#x27;s victory over the French and Spanish fleets at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, and his own death at the same battle. In 1852 a mechanized time ball was added, as a time signal to shipping in Leith harbour. The time ball is synchronized with the One O&#x27;Clock Gun firing from Edinburgh Castle. The monument was restored in 2009.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s White Ensign and signal flags spelling out Nelson&#x27;s famous message &quot;England expects that every man will do his duty&quot; are flown from the monument on Trafalgar Day each year.

==History==


The monument was constructed at the highest point of Calton Hill, at above sea-level, replacing an earlier mast used to send signals to shipping in the Forth. The monument was funded by public subscription and an initial design prepared by Alexander Nasmyth. His pagoda-like design was deemed too expensive, and an alternative design in the form of an upturned telescope—an object closely associated with Nelson—was obtained from the architect Robert Burn. Building began in 1807, and was almost complete when money ran out the following year. Burn died in 1815, and it was left to Thomas Bonnar to complete the pentagonal castellated building, which forms the base to the tower, between 1814 and 1816.
The tower was intended as a signal mast, attended by sailors who would be accommodated within the ground floor rooms, although these were in use as a tea room by 1820. Public access was available from the start, for a small fee. The rooms were later used to house the monument&#x27;s caretaker. In 2009, as part of the &quot;Twelve Monuments Restoration Project&quot;, the tower was comprehensively restored, including repairs to stonework and metalwork. The monument is a category A listed building.

The monument is high, and has 143 steps leading to a public viewing gallery. The castellated design reflects the castellated prison buildings which stood on the south side of Calton Hill in the early 19th century.

A plaque above the entrance to the monument carries the following dedication:

Above the plaque is a stone carving of the &quot;San Josef&quot;, a ship captured by Nelson at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797.

==Time ball==

On top of the tower is a time ball, a large ball which is raised and lowered to mark the time. It was installed in 1853 and became operational in March 1854 to act as a time signal to the ships in Edinburgh&#x27;s port of Leith, and to ships at the anchorage in the Firth of Forth known as Leith Roads, allowing the ships to set their chronometers. The time ball was the idea of Charles Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, and was originally triggered by a clock in the adjacent City Observatory, to which it was connected by an underground wire. The mechanism was the work of Maudslay, Sons &amp; Field of Lambeth, who had previously constructed the time ball mechanism for Greenwich Observatory. The installation was carried out by James Ritchie &amp; Son who are still retained by City of Edinburgh Council to maintain and operate the time ball.

The ball, constructed of wood and covered in zinc, and originally weighing about 90 kg, is raised just before 1 pm, and at precisely 1 pm, is dropped from atop the mast. The commonly stated mass of 15 cwt (762 kg) is a myth stemming from an exaggeration by Piazzi Smyth in 1853. Later, in 1861, the One O&#x27;Clock Gun was established at Edinburgh Castle to provide an audible signal when fog obscured the time ball. The time ball was operated for over 150 years, until it was damaged by a storm in 2007. In 2009, as part of the restoration of the monument, the time ball was removed, and the mechanism repaired. The time ball was brought back into service on 24 September 2009. The mechanism is now operated manually, based on the firing of the One O&#x27;Clock Gun.

<doc id="1080185" wikidata="Q154469" url="?curid=1080185" title="The Potato Eaters">
<text>The Potato Eaters () is an oil painting by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh painted in April 1885 in Nuenen, Netherlands.

It is in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. The original oil sketch is at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, and he made lithographs of the image, which are held in collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The painting is considered to be one of Van Gogh&#x27;s masterpieces.

==Composition==

During March and the beginning of April 1885, Van Gogh sketched studies for the painting and corresponded with his brother Theo, who was not impressed with his current work nor the sketches Van Gogh sent him in Paris. He began working on &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot; while living with his parents in Nuenen, a rural town which was home to many farmers, labourers and weavers. He worked on the painting from 13 April until the beginning of May, when it was mostly done except for minor changes that he made with a small brush later the same year.

Van Gogh said he wanted to depict peasants as they really were. He deliberately chose coarse and ugly models, thinking that they would be natural and unspoiled in his finished work.

Writing to his sister Willemina two years later in Paris, Van Gogh still considered &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot; his most successful painting: &quot;What I think about my own work is that the painting of the peasants eating potatoes that I did in Nuenen is after all the best thing I did&quot;. However, the work was criticized by his friend Anthon van Rappard soon after it was painted. This was a blow to Van Gogh&#x27;s confidence as an emerging artist, and he wrote back to his friend, &quot;you... had no right to condemn my work in the way you did&quot; (July 1885), and later, &quot;I am always doing &quot;what I can&#x27;t do yet&quot; in order to learn how to do it.&quot; (August 1885).

Vincent Van Gogh is known to have admired the Belgian painter Charles de Groux and in particular his work &quot;The blessing before supper&quot;. De Groux&#x27;s work is a solemn depiction of a peasant family saying grace before supper. The painting was closely linked to Christian representations of the Last Supper. Van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot; was inspired by this work of de Groux and similar religious connotations can be identified in Van Gogh&#x27;s work.

==Versions==
==Lithograph==
Van Gogh made a lithograph of the composition &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot; before embarking on the painting proper. He sent impressions to his brother and, in a letter to a friend, wrote that he made the lithograph from memory in the space of a day.

Van Gogh had first experimented with lithography in The Hague in 1882. Though he appreciated small scale graphic work and was an enthusiastic collector of English engravings he worked relatively little in graphic mediums. In a letter dated around 3 December 1882 he remarks
==Influence of the Hague School==
Van Gogh is often associated in people&#x27;s minds with the Post-Impressionist movement, but in fact his artistic roots lay much closer to home in the artists of the Hague School such as Anton Mauve and Jozef Israëls.

In a letter to his brother Theo written mid-June 1884, Vincent remarks:

Before Vincent painted &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot;, Israëls had already treated the same subject in his &quot;A Peasant Family at the Table&quot; and, judging from a comment in a letter to Theo 11 March 1882, Vincent had seen this (or at least a variation of it) and had been inspired to produce his own version of it. Compositionally, the two are very similar: in both paintings the composition of the painting is centered by a figure whose back is turned to the viewer. 

As well as an interest gained by &quot;A Peasant Family at the Table&quot;, Vincent had an appreciation for a simpler lifestyle. Vincent was known to disregard the finer things, once writing in a letter to his brother Theo:

Van Gogh seemed to emotionally identify with the middle class, although he was from a family who were quite well-off. The subject was that of the harsh reality of life in the working class. He also simply admired the sustainability of the potato, or &quot;aardappel&quot; in Dutch. &quot;Aardappel&quot; literally translates to &quot;earth apple,&quot; which paints an idea of a simpler, hearty lifestyle.

==Theft==
Thieves stole the early version of &quot;The Potato Eaters,&quot; the &quot;Weaver&#x27;s Interior&quot;, and &quot;Dried Sunflowers&quot; from the Kröller-Müller Museum in December 1988. In April 1989, the thieves returned &quot;Weaver&#x27;s Interior&quot; in an attempt to gain a $2.5 million ransom. The police recovered the other two on 14 July 1989; no ransom was paid.

On 14 April 1991, the Vincent van Gogh National Museum was robbed of twenty major paintings including the final version of &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot;. However, the getaway car suffered a blown tire, and the thieves were forced to flee, leaving the paintings behind. Thirty-five minutes after the robbery, the paintings were recovered.

<doc id="1080186" wikidata="Q1364836" url="?curid=1080186" title="FLEX (protocol)">
<text>FLEX is a communications protocol developed by Motorola and used in many pagers. FLEX provides one-way communication only (from the provider to the pager device), but a related protocol called ReFLEX provides two-way messaging.

== Protocol ==
Transmission of message data occurs in one of four modes: 1600/2, 3200/2, 3200/4, or 6400/4. All modes use FSK modulation. At 1600/2 this is on a 2 level FSK signal transmitted at 1600 bits per second. At 3200/2, this is a 2 level FSK signal transmitted at 3200 bits per second. At 3200/4, this is a 4 level FSK signal transmitted at 1600 symbols per second. Each 4 level symbol represents two bits for a bit rate of 3200 bits per second. At 6400/4, this is a 4 level FSK signal transmitted at 3200 symbols per second or 6400 bits per second.

Data is transmitted in a set of 128 frames that takes 4 minutes to complete. Each frame contains a sync followed by 11 data blocks. The data blocks contain 256, 512 or 1024 bits for 1600, 3200 or 6400 bits per second respectively.

The standard has been designed to allow the pager&#x27;s receiver to be turned off for a high percentage of the time and therefore save on battery usage.

==Security==
Transmitted data over FLEX is not encrypted. A BCH error correcting code is used to improve the integrity of the data, although this is not cryptographically secure.

There have been reported instances of individuals actively listening to pager traffic (private investigators, news organizations, etc.).

== Usage ==
In The Netherlands the emergency services use the Flex-protocol in the nationwide P2000 network for pagers. The traffic on this network can be monitored online.

In South Australia the State&#x27;s SAGRN network for the Emergency Services paging system (CFS, SES, MFS and SAAS) is run on the FLEX 1600 protocol, and can be monitored online.

<doc id="1080188" wikidata="Q7209603" url="?curid=1080188" title="Police riot">
<text>A police riot is a riot carried out by the police; more specifically, it is a riot that police are responsible for instigating, escalating or sustaining as a violent confrontation. Police riots are often characterized by widespread police brutality, and they may be done for the purpose of political repression.

The term &quot;police riot&quot; was popularized after its use in the Walker Report, which investigated the events surrounding the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago to describe the &quot;unrestrained and indiscriminate&quot; violence that Chicago Police Department officers &quot;inflicted upon persons who had broken no law, disobeyed no order, made no threat.&quot; During the 2020 George Floyd protests, columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that a police riot is &quot;an assertion of power and impunity&quot; that &quot;does more to inflame and agitate protesters than it does to calm the situation and bring order to the streets.&quot;

==History==
===United States===

====Haymarket Riot====

During the early years of labor union organizing, police violence was frequently used in efforts to quell protesting workers. One notable incident took place in May 1886, when police killed four striking workers at the McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. in Chicago. The following day, a peaceful demonstration in Haymarket Square erupted in violence when a bomb was thrown, killing eight policemen. Other police then opened fire, before or after they were fired on by people in the crowd (accounts vary) killing at least four demonstrators and wounding an undetermined number, in an event known as the Haymarket Riot; the events have been referred to as a police riot.

====Bloody Thursday====

In July 1934, police in San Francisco were involved in several encounters with striking longshore workers. After two picketers were killed, the other area unions joined together and called a general strike of all workers (the &quot;Big Strike&quot;). Subsequent criticism of the police was probably the occasion for the coining of the term &quot;police riot&quot;.

====Vietnam War protests====

During the Vietnam War, anti-war demonstrators frequently clashed with police, who were equipped with billy clubs and tear gas. The demonstrators claimed that the attacks were unprovoked; the authorities claimed the demonstrators were rioting. The most notorious of these assaults, which was shown on television and which included national television reporters in the chaos, took place during the August 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which was the scene of significant anti-war street protests. The actions of the police were later described as a police riot by the &quot;Walker Report&quot; to the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence.

====White Night Riots====

On May 21, 1979, in response to early demonstrations and unrest at San Francisco City Hall following the sentencing of Dan White for the killings of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, members of the San Francisco Police Department descended on the Castro District. With tape over their numbers they destroyed a gay bar and indiscriminately attacked civilians. Many patrons were beaten by police in riot gear, some two dozen arrests were made, and a number of people later sued the SFPD for their actions.

====Tompkins Square Park police riot====

In August 1988, a riot erupted in Tompkins Square Park in the East Village of New York City when police, some mounted on horseback, attempted to enforce a newly passed curfew for the park. Bystanders, artists, residents, homeless people, reporters, and political activists were caught up in the police action that took place during the night of August 6–7. Videotape evidence, provided by onlookers and participants, showed seemingly unprovoked violent acts by the police, as well as a number of officers having covered up or removed their names and badge numbers from their uniforms. The footage was broadcast on local television, resulting in widespread public awareness. In an editorial &quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed the incident a &quot;police riot&quot;.

==== Castro Sweep ====

On October 6, 1989, about 200 members of the San Francisco Police Department initiated a police riot in the Castro District following a peaceful march held by ACT UP to protest the United States government&#x27;s actions during the ongoing AIDS pandemic. The event was the first large-scale confrontation between the city&#x27;s LGBT community and the police since the White Night riots a decade earlier and resulted in 53 arrests and 14 people injured.

==== 1999 Seattle Protests ====

The term police riot has been applied by some to the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, where police clad in riot gear used clubs, tear gas and projectiles to disperse groups of protesters.

====2014 Ferguson protests====

During the Ferguson unrest, police clad in riot gear used clubs, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of protesters in Ferguson. Long Range Acoustic Devices and armored vehicles were heavily utilized to subdue protesters, and police threatened journalists and human rights workers on the scene. Some sources and observers described the event as a police riot, though the police denied any wrongdoing or police riot.

====George Floyd protests====

Police were accused in multiple cities of instigating unprovoked violence with persons who protested the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Democratic Socialist Virginia State Rep. Lee J. Carter criticized police actions as a &quot;police riot&quot;.

Videos from multiple cities showed police using tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets on protesters. In Seattle, a line of police officers attacked a crowd of protesters when a protester would not relinquish her umbrella. In Richmond, Virginia, police ended four days of peaceful protest by attacking protesters with pepper spray; police later admitted it was an &quot;unwarranted action&quot; and mayor Levar Stoney apologized, saying &quot;we violated your rights.&quot;

====Racial patterns====

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s database, in 2016 the rate of fatal police shootings per million was 10.13 for Native Americans, 6.6 for black people, 3.23 for Hispanics; 2.9 for white people and 1.17 for Asians. In absolute numbers, police kill more white people than any other race or ethnicity, understood in light of the fact that white people make up the largest proportion of the US population. As a percentage of the U.S. population, black Americans were 2.5 times more likely than whites to be killed by the police in 2015. A 2015 study found that unarmed black people were 3.49 times more likely to be shot by police than were unarmed white people. Another study published in 2016 concluded that the mortality rate of legal interventions among black and Hispanic people was 2.8 and 1.7 times higher than that among white people. Another 2015 study concluded that black people were 2.8 times more likely to be killed by police than whites. They also concluded that black people were more likely to be unarmed than white people who were in turn more likely to be unarmed than Hispanic people shot by the police. A 2018 study in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; found the mortality rate by police per 100,000 was 1.9 to 2.4 for black men, 0.8 to 1.2 for Hispanic men and 0.6 to 0.7 for white men.

The table below gives recent CDC statistics showing the proportions of fatal police shootings and all firearm deaths by race.
A 2016 working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research by economist Roland G. Fryer, Jr. found that while overall &quot;blacks are 21 percent more likely than whites to be involved in an interaction with police in which at least a weapon is drawn&quot; and that in the raw data from New York City&#x27;s Stop and Frisk program &quot;blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to have an interaction with police which involves any use of force&quot; after &quot;[p]artitioning the data in myriad ways, we find no evidence of racial discrimination in officer-involved shootings.&quot; A 2020 study by political scientists disputed the findings by Fryer, saying that if police had a higher threshold for stopping whites, this might mean that the whites, Hispanics and blacks in Fryer&#x27;s data are not similar. Nobel-laureate James Heckman and Steven Durlauf, both University of Chicago economists, published a response to the Fryer study, writing that the paper &quot;does not establish credible evidence on the presence or absence of discrimination against African Americans in police shootings&quot; due to issues with selection bias. Fryer responded by saying Durlauf and Heckman erroneously claim that his sample is &quot;based on stops&quot;. Further, he states that the &quot;vast majority of the data...is gleaned from 911 calls for service in which a civilian requests police presence.&quot;

====Battle of the Beanfield====

During an attempt to enforce an exclusion zone around Stonehenge, Wiltshire, in 1985, the police entered the field where a group of travelers known as the Peace Convoy were being detained and began damaging their vehicles and beating the occupants. The travelers eventually sued the Wiltshire police force for wrongful arrest, assault and criminal damage.

<text>Michael Philip Des Barres, 26th Marquis Des Barres, (born 24 January 1948) is an English actor and pop singer. He appeared as Murdoc in the original &quot;MacGyver&quot;, Lenny Stokes in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;, and Murdoc&#x27;s mentor Nicholas Helman in &quot;MacGyver&quot; (2016). He replaced Robert Palmer in the band the Power Station, fronting the band at the 1985 Live Aid concert.

==Early life==
The only child of Philip and Irene Des Barres (Marquis and Marquise Des Barres), Michael Philip Des Barres was born and brought up in Hove, Sussex. He attended Repton School, a boarding school in Derbyshire, and went on to attend the Corona Academy drama school in London and appeared in several plays. He has some French ancestry. His title of Marquis was bestowed upon a 13th-century ancestor Guillaume II Des Barres, a French knight, after rescuing King Philip II of France during the Battle of Bouvines in 1214.

==Career==

===Music===
Des Barres started his musical career in the glam rock band Silverhead in England in 1972. The group released two albums on Deep Purple&#x27;s record label Purple Records before breaking up in 1974.

After leaving Silverhead, Des Barres moved to Los Angeles, where he formed the band Detective. The band was signed to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Swan Song Records label by Jimmy Page, whom Des Barres had met after a Silverhead performance in Birmingham, England, that the members of Led Zeppelin had attended.

Following the break-up of Detective in 1978, Des Barres formed Chequered Past in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;michaeldesbarres.com/bio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 he co-wrote and recorded the song &quot;Obsession&quot; with Holly Knight. In 1984, the band Animotion had an international top-ten hit with their cover.

Des Barres met the members of Duran Duran when Chequered Past opened for a few shows during their 1984 tour. In 1985, when Robert Palmer withdrew from the Duran Duran side project the Power Station just before their American summer tour, Des Barres was chosen to take his place as lead vocalist.

On 5 November 2013, the Michael Des Barres Band released a live album, &quot;Hot n Sticky Live&quot;, which was recorded at the Viper Room in Los Angeles in November 2012.

On 7 April 2015 Des Barres released a solo album, &quot;The Key to the Universe&quot;. Produced by Bob Rose at The Forum Music Village in Rome, the album reunited Des Barres with Nigel Harrison (former bassist of Blondie and Silverhead) on bass and guitar, in addition to Clive Deamer (Radiohead, Portishead, Robert Plant) on drums, and Dani Robinson on guitar.

In 2018, he formed the Mistakes, consisting of all veteran musicians – Loren Molinare (founding member of Little Caesar &amp; the Dogs) on guitar, Eric Himel (Powerman 5000, host of the Sunset Jam) on guitar, Paul Ill (LA-based musician with sales of over 20 million records as a studio musician and 4.5 million records as a songwriter) on bass guitar, and Matt Starr (studio and touring drummer with Guns N&#x27; Roses, Ace Frehley, Bon Jovi &amp; Whitesnake) on drums. The band is signed to Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s Wicked Cool Records and has released 4 songs – &quot;Living in the USA&quot;/&quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot; (1/19/18) and &quot;Crackle and Hiss&quot;/&quot;Stop in the Name of Love&quot; (7/5/19). The Mistakes&#x27; plans to tour Japan and Russia in 2020 were cancelled because of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

===Acting===
Des Barres has appeared in over 100 different TV shows and almost 30 movies in his career. He first started acting at 8 years old as &#x27;the Nux Bar Kid&#x27; on posters all over England. He appeared (uncredited) in the 1966 film starring Tony Curtis, &quot;Drop Dead Darling&quot;. His first credited film role was as a supporting cast member in the classic 1967 film &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot;, playing an East End pupil who always wears dark sunglasses indoors and out, followed by a few other minor roles before he decided to pursue a career in music instead. He later concentrated his energies on acting again and was cast in &quot;Ghoulies&quot; (1985) as cult leader Malcolm Graves, and &quot;Nightflyers&quot; (1987) as a charismatic empath. He worked opposite Clint Eastwood in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;. His other film roles have included &quot;Midnight Cabaret&quot; (1990), &quot;Under Siege&quot; (1992), &quot;Waxwork II: Lost in Time&quot; (1992), &quot;A Simple Twist of Fate&quot; (1994), and &quot;Sugar Town&quot; (1999). He also appeared in the 2004 film &quot;Catch That Kid&quot; and had a brief part in David Lynch&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;.

On television, besides the role of Murdoc in &quot;MacGyver&quot;, Des Barres was also a lead cast member of &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; during the 1991–1992 season, as part of a husband-and-wife morning team. He had previously appeared on the original &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; as the lead singer of a punk band, Scum of the Earth. On &quot;Roseanne&quot; he portrayed Leon&#x27;s boyfriend as well as appearing as one of Darlene&#x27;s baby&#x27;s doctors on one of the final episodes of the series. Some of his dozens of television appearances include &quot;Seinfeld&quot;; &quot;Renegade&quot;; &quot;ALF&quot;; &quot;Ellen&quot;; &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;; &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;; &quot;Hart To Hart&quot;; &quot;My Sister Sam&quot;; &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;, which reunited him with another &quot;MacGyver&quot; alumnus, Teri Hatcher; &quot;JAG&quot;; &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, where he played devilish Arthur Field in 11 episodes; &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;; &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;; &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;; &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot;; &quot;Sliders&quot;; &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;; &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;; &quot;The Pretender&quot;; &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;; &quot;Frasier&quot;; &quot;Hawaii&quot;; &quot;Bones&quot;; and &quot;NCIS&quot; in the Season 10 episode &quot;Phoenix&quot;.

On 23 October 2013, Des Barres joined the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the world premiere of &quot;200 Motels: The Suites&quot;, by Frank Zappa, in which he appeared as Rance, the narrator.

===Radio===
Recently, Des Barres hosts &quot;The Michael Des Barres Program&quot; every weekday morning from 8–11 AM ET with a replay every weekday evening from 9- midnight PT on Little Steven&#x27;s Underground Garage (SiriusXM Channel 21). Over six million listeners hear an eclectic mix of rock, soul and punk, infused with Des Barres&#x27; extensive musical knowledge and his messages of positivity and longevity.

===Documentary: &quot;Michael Des Barres: Who Do You Want Me To Be&quot;===
In 2021, Des Barres released the documentary &quot;Who Do You Want Me To Be&quot;, directed by J. Elvis Weinstein, on streaming platforms plus DVD and Blu-ray. The tag line for the film is &quot;The son of a junkie aristocrat and a schizophrenic showgirl becomes a master of reinvention on a 50+ year journey through rock and roll, TV, and movies.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1974, Des Barres married his girlfriend of seven years, actress Wendy Hamilton (Professor Emeritus Wendy Wheeler, London Metropolitan University). They divorced when Michael moved to Los Angeles following the disbandment of Silverhead.

Des Barres was married to Pamela Des Barres from 1977 until 1991. They have a son, Nicholas Des Barres, who is a writer and video game designer.

Des Barres has been sober since June 1981. In the mid-1980s, he was one of the founding members of Rock Against Drugs. He later did volunteer addiction counselling and worked with homeless teens. Des Barres has also organised and hosted the annual Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock Film Festival, which first took place in 2003.

Des Barres married his long-term girlfriend, Britta Hayertz, on December 21, 2018.

<text>The Ford-[[Philco]] GAU-7/A was an abortive program initiated by United States Air Force in the late 1960s to develop a new cannon for the proposed F-14 ADC interceptor and replace the M61 Vulcan on the then-upcoming F-15 Eagle. The GAU-7/A was a 25 mm Gatling gun using telescoped ammunition with a combustible case developed by the Brunswick Corporation. It was intended to have greater range and hitting power than the 20 mm Vulcan, while the caseless ammunition would have alleviated the problems of either storing or ejecting spent cartridges, both of which present considerable problems for jet aircraft.

Despite great expenditure, the project and its ammunition proved to be a failure, and it was canceled in 1974. The F-15 therefore retained the M61A1 cannon, as have most U.S. fighter aircraft since 1956.
