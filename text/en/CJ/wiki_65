<text>Hani Fawzi Mulki (also known as Hani Mulki; ; &quot;&quot;; born 15 October 1951) is a Jordanian politician that held several ministerial and diplomatic positions, and he was Chief Commissioner of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority before his designation as the 41st Prime Minister of Jordan by King Abdullah II and approval by the House of Representatives on 29 May 2016.

Mulki served as Prime Minister until he submitted his resignation on 4 June 2018 after protests had swept the country because of his government&#x27;s IMF-backed austerity measures that aimed to tackle Jordan&#x27;s growing public debt. The measures would raise the price of goods and services, as well as hike the tax rate.

==Early life==
Born in Amman in 1951, into a family of Syrian descent. His father, Fawzi Mulki, was the 10th prime minister of Jordan. Mulki received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in production engineering in Egypt in 1974 and pursued his Masters and Doctoral degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

==Career== 

He served as Jordan&#x27;s ambassador to Egypt and as Jordan&#x27;s permanent representative at the Arab League. He has held several ministerial positions; water, energy, supplies, industry and foreign affairs ministries.

Mulki chaired the negotiating committee which produced the Israel-Jordan peace treaty between Jordan and Israel in 1994. During his time as foreign minister, Jordan experienced diplomatic issues with both Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Mulki was appointed as Scientific Advisor to the King, and then a member of the Senate. On 9 February 2011, Mulki was reappointed as Minister of Trade and Industries. On 9 November 2014, he was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, replacing Kamel Mahadin. On 29 May 2016, Mulki was appointed as the Prime Minister of Jordan, succeeding Abdullah Ensour. His cabinet was sworn in on 1 June. After the 2016 general election Mulki order a cabinet reshuffle, which resulted in three new portfolios, 22 ministers remaining and the introduction of 7 new ministers.

Rising Jordanian public debt led Mulki in 2016 to negotiate a 3-year program $732 million loan facility with the International Monetary Fund, which would see the public debt falling from 95% of the GDP to 77% by 2021. The austerity program raised prices on several food staples in 2016 and 2017, making him very unpopular in the country. A 22 March 2018 report by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace commented on Mulki&#x27;s policies: &quot;Mulki declared openly that his predecessors had left the country at the brink of insolvency and that the failure to take tough revenue-raising measure would lead to a debt crisis which would destroy the country. And he is correct. What is more doubtful is Mulki’s assertion that Jordan “will get out of the bottleneck” in 2019. While the measures to raise taxes and reduce subsidies buy time, they leave Jordan struggling to stay afloat and dependent on the continued flow of extensive aid.&quot;

A nationwide strike organized by trade unions on 30 May 2018 in protest of Mulki&#x27;s government presenting amendments to the 2014 income tax law to Parliament. The next day, his government raised fuel and electricity prices in response to rising international oil prices, prompting crowds of protestors to pour in the 4th circle near the Prime Ministry in Amman. King Abdullah intervened on 1 June and ordered the freeze of price hikes. Mulki&#x27;s cabinet acquiesced but said the decision would cost the treasury $20 million. Despite the freeze, widespread protests continued due to the tax law. He submitted his resignation on 4 June 2018 and was succeeded by Omar Razzaz, his education minister.

<doc id="1103461" wikidata="Q610075" url="?curid=1103461" title="Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome">
<text>Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a chromosomal deletion syndrome resulting from a partial deletion on the short arm of chromosome 4 [del(4)(p16.3)]. Features include a distinct craniofacial phenotype and intellectual disability.

==Signs and symptoms==

The most common characteristics include a distinct craniofacial phenotype (microcephaly, micrognathia, short philtrum, prominent glabella, ocular hypertelorism, dysplastic ears and periauricular tags), growth restriction, intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, seizures, and congenital heart defects. 

Less common characteristics include hypospadias, colobomata of the iris, renal anomalies, and deafness. Antibody deficiencies are also common, including common variable immunodeficiency and IgA deficiency. T-cell immunity is normal.

==Genetics==
Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome is a microdeletion syndrome caused by a deletion within HSA band 4p16.3 of the short arm of chromosome 4, particularly in the region of WHSCR1 and WHSCR2. The phenotypic characteristics of WHS are thought to be caused by the haploinsufficiency of the genes Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (WHSC1), which is associated with craniofacial features and growth delay, and Homo Sapiens leucine zipper-EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1), which is associated with seizures.

About 87% of cases represent a &quot;de novo&quot; deletion, while about 13% are inherited from a parent with a chromosome translocation. In the cases of familial transmission, there is a 2 to 1 excess of maternal transmission. Of the &quot;de novo&quot; cases, 80% are paternally derived. 

A more uncommon cause for WHS is the formation of a ring chromosome. A ring chromosome can form when a chromosome breaks apart and forms a circular structure to fuse together. That process may initiate gene loss towards the ends of the chromosome.

Severity of symptoms and expressed phenotype differ based on the amount of genetic material deleted. The critical region for determining the phenotype is at 4p16.3 and can often be detected through genetic testing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Genetic testing and genetic counseling is offered to affected families.

==Diagnosis==

Initial diagnosis is based on a distinct craniofacial phenotype after birth. Diagnosis of WHS is confirmed by the detection of a deletion in the WHSCR.
Chromosomal microarray and Cytogenetic analysis.D4S96 or D4Z1 chromosome band 4p16.3–specific probe (Wolf-Hirschhorn region, Vysis, Inc) is available for FISH study.

== Treatment ==
The symptoms can vary from person to person, so the patient should receive different types of evaluations including a neurological, cardiac, and renal evaluation. Eye and hearing exams are essential, as well as a feeding and developmental evaluation. Clinicians treat WHS by addressing the symptoms experienced by the individual. Some treatment methods are surgery for growth abnormalities, educational programs that can help with cognition, physical therapy for muscle building, and medication for seizures.

==Epidemiology==
The minimum birth incidence has been estimated as 1 in 50,000. For unknown reasons, WHS occurs twice as often in females than in males.

==History==
Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome was first described in 1961 by the Austrian-born American pediatrician Kurt Hirschhorn and his colleagues.

Thereafter, the syndrome gained worldwide attention after publications by the German geneticist Ulrich Wolf and his co-workers, specifically their articles in the German scientific magazine &quot;Humangenetik&quot;.

<doc id="1103463" wikidata="Q933113" url="?curid=1103463" title="Blaydon">
<text>Blaydon is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England, and historically in County Durham. Blaydon, and neighbouring Winlaton, which Blaydon is now contiguous with, form the town of Blaydon-on-Tyne. The Blaydon/Winlaton ward had a population in 2011 of 13,896.

Between 1894 and 1974, Blaydon was an urban district which extended inland from the Tyne along the River Derwent for ten miles (16 km), and included the mining communities of Chopwell and High Spen, the villages of Rowlands Gill, Blackhall Mill, Barlow, Winlaton Mill and Stella, as well as Blaydon and Winlaton. During its existence, the Urban District&#x27;s fourteen and a half square miles constituted the second largest administrative district by area, on Tyneside, after Newcastle upon Tyne.

==History==

The town of Blaydon is essentially an industrial area and is not more than two centuries old. Indeed, in the 1760s there was little here but a few farms and cottages. In the latter part of the same century a smelting works was set up from which sprang the industrial growth of the area.

Though the town itself has a relatively short history there has been activity in the area for many centuries.

===Early history===

The earliest recorded evidence of human activity at Blaydon is a Neolithic polished stone axe found in the early 20th century. Finds and structures from later prehistoric periods include a bronze spearhead and log-boat, both recovered from the River Tyne in the 19th century. A number of Bronze Age cists are recorded from Summerhill and several others from Bewes Hill.

Little is recorded of medieval Blaydon, which appears to have been based upon the modern farm sites of High and Low Shibdon. The Blaydon Burn Belts Corn Mill, part of a row of 5 or 6 water corn mills stretching from Brockwell Wood to the River Tyne is known to have been present by the early 17th century, suggesting a healthy population at that time. It is likely that, as well as farming, many industrial activities such as mining and quarrying had begun in the medieval and post-medieval periods, well before the industrial period of the 18th to 20th centuries when Blaydon became an important industrial centre.

===Battle of Stella Ford===

Also known as the Battle of Newburn or Newburn Ford, this relatively unknown battle has recently been elevated in importance by English Heritage. On 28 August 1640, 20,000 Scots defeated 5,500 English soldiers who were defending the ford over the Tyne four miles (6 km) west of Newcastle. The Scots had been provoked by Charles I, who had imposed bishops and a foreign prayer book on their church. The Scots army, led by Alexander Leslie, fought its way to Newcastle and occupied the city for almost a year before Charles I paid it £200,000 to depart. The battle brought to an end the so-called &#x27;Eleven Years of Tyranny&#x27; by forcing Charles to recall Parliament.

===The 18th century and the Industrial Revolution===

The stimulus for industry at Blaydon and Blaydon Burn, as elsewhere in the region, was the growth in coal mining and the coal trade, particularly from the early 18th century, when the Hazard and Speculation pits were established at Low Shibdon linked to the Tyne by wagonways. The 18th century Blaydon Main Colliery was reopened in the mid-19th century and worked until 1921. Other pits and associated features included Blaydon Burn Colliery, Freehold pit and the Blaydon Burn Wagonway. Industries supported by the coal trade included chemical works, bottle works, sanitary pipe works, lampblack works, an ironworks, a smithy and brickworks - Cowen&#x27;s Upper and Lower Brickworks were established in 1730 and were associated with a variety of features including a clay drift mine and coal/clay drops. The Lower works remains in operation. Blaydon Burn Coke Ovens, also of 19th-century origin, were replaced in the 1930s by Priestman Ottovale Coke and Tar Works which was the first in the world to produce petrol from coal known as Blaydon Benzole.

In addition to the workers&#x27; housing developments associated with industrialisation, a number of grand residences were constructed for industrialists in the area, such as Blaydon Burn House, home of Joseph Cowen, owner of the brickworks. Ironically, the remains of Old Dockendale Hall, an earlier grand residence (or perhaps a superior farmhouse) of 17th century or earlier construction, was destroyed when the coke and tar works was built at Blaydon Burn.

===Blaydon School Press===

In the 1930s, pupils at the now demolished Blaydon Intermediate School, under the leadership of English teacher Mr Elliott and art teacher Mr Boyce, gradually developed a technique for producing hardback books. Their productions were highly respected and favourably compared to other successful private printing presses of the time. In one volume produced by the school in 1935, entitled &quot;Songs of Enchantment&quot;, the pupils were successful in convincing the famous poet Walter de la Mare to write a foreword in which he praised their enterprise and efforts.

===Stella South Power Station===

The post war era of the late 40s and 50s saw a rapid rise in demand for electricity and, in the North East, the extension of existing and construction of a number of new power stations was seen as a key part of the solution. For the Blaydon area, this meant the arrival of a new power station at Stella Haugh, known as the South Stella Power Station, which helped to meet the energy demands of the North East until its closure in 1991. It was demolished in 1992.

== Landmarks ==

===Axwell Hall===

On the west of the town and a mile inland from the Tyne is Axwell Park, once the home of the Clavering family. Axwell Hall (also Axwell House) is a Grade II* listed mansion, built for Sir Thomas Clavering by the noted architect James Paine and completed in 1761. The last (10th) baronet died in 1893 and Axwell Hall later found use as a prisoner-of-war camp during the second world war and later as an approved school. Much of the park has been developed for residential purposes and the hall itself was, after two decades of decay, restored. There are plans to convert it to residential apartments.

=== Stella Hall ===
Up-river from Blaydon and outside the town boundary, Stella Hall was a 17th-century mansion set in a park. The house was built by the Tempest family, and in the next century passed by marriage to Lord Widdrington and then into the Towneley family. From 1850 it was owned by Joseph Cowen, owner of the local brickworks and MP for Newcastle, who was followed by his son, also Joseph, again an MP and also the owner of the &quot;Newcastle Chronicle&quot;. The house was demolished in 1955 to make way for housing.

== Governance ==

Blaydon ward elects three councillors to Gateshead Council. In the House of Commons, the Blaydon constituency has been held by Liz Twist for the Labour Party since 2017. The area has traditionally been a Labour stronghold and the seat has been held by them since 1935.

==Geography==

Modern Blaydon stands close to the Tyne with the A695, a key road from Gateshead to Hexham, passing through the town centre. Between this main road and the river is the railway and beyond it, on a bend of the Tyne, is the industrial district of Blaydon Haughs. The main part of the town lies south of the railway.

Despite being a largely urban and industrial area, there are various rural aspects to Blaydon and the surrounding area. The area has many acres of open countryside, mostly at or more above sea level, and numerous farms and similar holdings. Between High Spen and Chopwell are large Forestry Commission woods, and these and other forested areas extend westward down the hillside to the River Derwent, which forms most of the metropolitan district boundary.

Shibdon Pond, on the eastern edge of the town at the former site of Blaydon Main colliery, is a nature reserve with many species of waterfowl. English Nature has designated Shibdon Pond as one of Tyne and Wear&#x27;s Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The subject of a regeneration campaign, Shibdon Dene (sometimes inaccurately called &#x27;Blaydon Dene&#x27;) is another recreational area consisting of a pathway between a great number of fine trees.

There is also a nature reserve north-west of Blaydon at Blaydon Burn, on the route of a wagon-way which carried coal to the riverside. The track, roughly a mile-and-a-half long, is used by walkers and cyclists and ends near the Path Head Watermill.

Blaydon contains the following districts, some of them having been swallowed up by urban sprawl.

* Blaydon town centre
* Blaydon Haughs
* South Blaydon (Winlaton)
* Axwell Park
* Shibdon

Stella and Winlaton Mill are outer suburbs of the town, as they are not within Blaydon&#x27;s boundaries but are nearby.

==Demography==
Blaydon had a population of 15,155 in the 2011 census, which increased from 14,648 a decade earlier.

==Economy==

Once the powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution in Gateshead, Blaydon&#x27;s traditional industry was coal mining. However, since the decline of mining in the 1950s and 1960s, the economy has diversified. As well as a small number of commuting professionals, residents of Blaydon are often involved in engineering and manufacturing with many businesses operating from premises in Blaydon Haughs (or &#x27;The Spike&#x27;), on the banks of the River Tyne.

Blaydon was for a time the head office of Associated Cooperative Creameries (later renamed ACC then ACC Milk). ACC Milk was sold to Dairy Farmers of Britain in 2004. On 3 June 2009, Dairy Farmers of Britain went into receivership and the dairy in Chainbridge Road closed shortly afterwards with the loss of 300 jobs. In 2010 the dairy was acquired by Medina Dairies and reopened, but closed again just a year later.

Blaydon has a shopping centre, known locally as the precinct. A brutalist 1970s creation, it contains the town&#x27;s major shops. Blaydon Car Boot Sale takes place every Wednesday between March and October at Blaydon RFC. The area underwent a significant programme of housing regeneration between 2009 and 2014 with new developments in progress at High View on the Winlaton-Blaydon border, by the riverside on the site of the former Stella South power station and at Axwell Gardens, near to the existing Axwell Park estate.

==Transport==
===Air===
The nearest airport to Blaydon is Newcastle International Airport, which is located around away by road. Teesside International Airport and Carlisle Lake District Airport are located around away by road, respectively.

===Rail===
Historically, Blaydon was a major railway hub for both passenger and freight services. The town occupied an important geographical position in relation to Newcastle upon Tyne, which could be reached using the Scotswood Railway Bridge. Blaydon served as the eastern terminus of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, following the opening of the first section of the line in March 1835.

Blaydon is served by the Tyne Valley Line, with services currently operated by Northern Trains. After a number of years of limited service, 2014 saw the restoration of a much-improved timetable. As of the December 2019 timetable change, there is generally an hourly service between Newcastle and Hexham, with some additional trains stopping during peak times.

===Road===
Blaydon is linked to Newcastle upon Tyne and the A1 to the east, by the A695, which used to pass through the centre of the town. The A695 road now bypasses the town centre to the north. The A695 links Blaydon with Hexham, which is located about to the west of the town.

===Blaydon Bus Station===

Blaydon Bus Station is served predominantly by Go North East&#x27;s local bus services, with frequent routes running in and around Gateshead and Newcastle upon Tyne, as well as Northumberland and the Tyne Valley.

In 2009, the bus station was refurbished, at a cost of around £100,000. The refurbishment saw the installation of new shelters at each of its four stands, upgraded lighting systems, and the addition of real-time information systems.

==Education==

Blaydon is part of the Gateshead Local Education Authority. It is home to a number of primary schools (both faith and secular schools) including Blaydon West primary and St Joseph&#x27;s, a Roman Catholic primary school. It also has St Thomas More Catholic School, a high achieving Roman Catholic secondary school which serves the Roman Catholic population of the western part of Gateshead borough.

==Religious sites==
Blaydon has several churches. In the town centre, St Cuthbert&#x27;s (Church of England, opened in 1845) and St Joseph&#x27;s (Roman Catholic, opened in 1905 on the site of an earlier church) are opposite each other, on either side of Shibdon Road. Both are impressive structures, and the interiors still reflect the style of architecture used in their construction. Also on Shibdon Road, at the corner with Lucy Street and opposite the entrance to the roof-top car park above Morrisons, is Trinity Methodist Church.

There is also a Catholic church in Stella (St Mary and Thomas Aquinas, opened 1835) .

A brand new Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses was opened in 2013, near Cowen Road. This was built by voluntary labour as Witnesses from all over the North-East donned hard hats and work gear, working under the supervision of professional builders.

In Winlaton, the parish church of Winlaton opened in 1828, the Congregational church in 1829, and the Wesleyan Chapel in 1868. The latter two united to form Winlaton United Reformed-Methodist Church, but this closed in August 2015, with some members moving to join Trinity Methodist Church in Blaydon. The Primitive Methodists had opened a building in 1850, which was extended in 1895, and was later to become the Blaydon Corps of the Salvation Army; this corps closed in September 2012. St Anne&#x27;s Catholic Church in Winlaton was opened in 1962.

==Sports==

The Blaydon area is the origin of the well-known traditional song &quot;Blaydon Races&quot;, written by local musician and showman George &#x27;Geordie&#x27; Ridley in 1862. The town&#x27;s athletic club – the Blaydon Harriers – organise a road running race (called the Blaydon Race) every year on 9 June. The route of the race follows the route outlined by Ridley in his song. The traditional starting point lies outside Balmbra&#x27;s pub in Newcastle&#x27;s Bigg Market, and the race follows a course along Scotswood Road before crossing the River Tyne and ultimately finishing in Blaydon town centre. Local councillors, societies and notaries have in recent years organised an annual Blaydon Festival with music, sport and arts events that coincides with the week of race day.

As well as the Blaydon races, The Blaydon Harriers organise regular race meetings on the Shibdon Pond fields (and other venues) throughout the year. These are usually well-attended both by participants and spectators. The Harriers&#x27; colours are orange and black.

The rugby union club, Blaydon RFC play in the English National League 2 North, the fourth tier of the English rugby union system and a high level considering the size of the town. The Crow Trees rugby ground is situated to the east of the town, in neighbouring Swalwell. Blaydon RFC play in red shirts and white shorts. The former England international Mick Skinner played for Blaydon. Their smaller but no less illustrious neighbours, Winlaton Vulcans RFC play in Durham and Northumberland Division 2 and number Ken Goodall, the former Ireland and British Lion International, as one of their former players. They play in black shirts, shorts and socks with the club badge of an arm gripping a hammer over an anvil depicting their heritage being formed from the steelworking heritage of the area.

Since 2013 Blaydon has also been host to Blaydon Cycle Club, meeting weekly and throughout the week catering from novice cyclists right through to having a race team competing in local and national events.

<doc id="1103465" wikidata="Q2412424" url="?curid=1103465" title="The Latino Rockabilly War">
<text>The Latino Rockabilly War was a band most notable for backing the Clash frontman Joe Strummer. The band, which played a fusion of Latin and rock music, was formed by Strummer with meeting Joey Altruda and Willie McNeil of jazz-punk group Tupelo Chain Sex, along with musician Zander Schloss.

With Strummer, the Latino Rockabilly War created the album &quot;Earthquake Weather&quot;, released through Epic Records. The album was well received by critics, but did not sell well. Led by Strummer, the band also contributed five songs to the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Permanent Record&quot;, which featured a young Keanu Reeves: &quot;Trash City&quot;, &quot;Baby the Trans&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; &#x27;bout Nothin&quot;, &quot;Nefertiti Rock&quot;, and the instrumental &quot;Theme from Permanent Record&quot;.

In a segment of the documentary film &quot;Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten&quot;, Anthony Kiedis mentions that during the period in which the band&#x27;s material was recorded, drummer Jack Irons (formerly of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam) was in residency at a mental institution. Therefore, Strummer had to arrange transportation and leave for Irons in order for him to participate in the band&#x27;s output.

The band toured with Strummer on the &quot;Rock Against The Rich Tour in 1988&quot; with friends in tow, including film director Alex Cox. Their sets included songs spanning Strummer&#x27;s career to that point, including works from the 101ers and the Clash, material co-written with Mick Jones for Big Audio Dynamite&#x27;s &quot;No. 10, Upping St.&quot; album, and a cover of the Pogues&#x27; song &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God.&quot;

==Members==
*Zander Schloss – lead and rhythm guitar
*Lonnie Marshall – bass guitar
*Joey Altruda – bass guitar (1988 on the Permanent Record-soundtrack)
*Jim Donica – bass guitar (1988 on the Rock Against The Rich Tour)

<doc id="1103469" wikidata="Q6141321" url="?curid=1103469" title="USS Steelhead">
<text>USS &quot;Steelhead&quot; (SS-280), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the steelhead, a North American trout found from California to Alaska.

&quot;Steelhead&quot; (SS-280) was laid down on 1 June 1942 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 11 September 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Marguerite Brown; and commissioned on 7 December 1942.

== First war patrol, April – June 1943 ==

&quot;Steelhead&quot; held her shakedown off Long Island in December 1942 and January 1943. In February, she sailed for the Pacific and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 April. After intensive training, she sailed for Midway Island; topped off her fuel there on 25 April, and began her first war patrol. She planted 12 mines off the Japanese mainland near Erimo Saki and then bombarded a steel plant and iron foundry near Muroran, Hokkaidō. She fired no torpedoes, and the submarine returned to Midway in early June.

== Second war patrol, June – August 1943 ==

On her second patrol, 30 June to 6 August, &quot;Steelhead&quot; fired 10 torpedoes at a Japanese task force on 10 July. Explosions were heard, but specific damage could not be ascertained. 

After refitting at Pearl Harbor, the ship sailed on 13 September for the Gilbert Islands where she operated as a lifeguard submarine off Tarawa during bombardment by Army aircraft.

She called at Johnston Island for fuel and provisions and departed on 25 September to resume her patrol which took her into the Palau Islands. On 6 October off the Carolines, she damaged tanker &quot;Kazalhaya&quot;, which sank later that day. All her torpedoes expended, &quot;Steelhead&quot; sighted a large convoy which she trailed, while sending information to other submarines in the area.

== Third, fourth, and fifth war patrols, December 1943 – August 1944 ==

On her next patrol, &quot;Steelhead&quot; operated off Bungo Suido from late December 1943 to early March 1944. On 10 January 1944, she torpedoed and sank the 6,795 ton converted salvage vessel, &quot;Yamabiko Maru&quot;.

Her fourth patrol, off Formosa from early April to 23 May, provided no targets worthy of torpedo fire, but she sank a trawler by gunfire.

On 17 June, she sortied from Midway Island with and to patrol south of Formosa. On 31 July, the submarine made three successful attacks in which one ship was damaged and two were sunk. &quot;Parche&quot; also sank two from the convoy. Upon concluding the patrol when she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 16 August, &quot;Steelhead&quot; was routed to the West Coast for a much needed overhaul.

For his services in that last patrol Whelchel, a grandson of Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet, was awarded the Silver Star.

== Sixth war patrol, April – August 1945 ==

While in drydock, on 1 October 1944 &quot;Steelhead&quot; suffered a serious fire which required the installation of a new conning tower. After a long repair period, the submarine stood out of San Francisco on 16 April 1945, en route to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Steelhead&quot; began her last war patrol on 13 May. She performed lifeguard duty in the Caroline Islands and later patrolled in the Tokyo Bay area. She made no torpedo attacks but sank two trawlers by gunfire. The patrol ended at Midway Island on 5 August and, 20 days later, she sailed for the West Coast.

&quot;Steelhead&quot; arrived at San Francisco on 5 September 1945 and provided services for the West Coast Sonar School until 2 January 1946. She sailed to Pearl Harbor and operated from there until March when she steamed back to San Francisco for inactivation. The submarine was placed in reserve, out of commission, on 29 June 1946 and attached to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. In May 1947, &quot;Steelhead&quot; was placed in service, in reserve, and used as a reserve training ship until struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1960.

&quot;Steelhead&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Lionel Pretoria Conacher ( ; May 24, 1900 – May 26, 1954), nicknamed &quot;the Big Train&quot;, was a Canadian athlete and politician. Voted the country&#x27;s top athlete of the first half of the 20th century, he won championships in numerous sports. His first passion was Canadian football; he was a member of the 1921 Grey Cup champion Toronto Argonauts. He was also a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team that won the International League championship in 1926. In hockey, he won a Memorial Cup in 1920, and the Stanley Cup twice: with the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 and the Montreal Maroons in 1935. Additionally, he won wrestling, boxing and lacrosse championships during his playing career. He is one of three players, including Joe Miller and Carl Voss, to have their names engraved on both the Grey Cup and Stanley Cup.

Conacher retired as an athlete in 1937 to enter politics. He won election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1937, and in 1949 won a seat in the House of Commons. Many of his political positions revolved around sports. He worked to eliminate corruption in boxing while serving as a member of provincial parliament (MPP) in Ontario, also serving as the chairman of the Ontario Athletic Commission. Additionally, he served a term as director of recreation and entertainment for the Royal Canadian Air Force. It was also on the sports field that Conacher died: He suffered a heart attack twenty minutes after hitting a triple in a softball game played on the lawn of Parliament Hill.

Numerous organizations have honoured Conacher&#x27;s career. In addition to being named Canada&#x27;s athlete of the half-century, he was named the country&#x27;s top football player over the same period. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1955, the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1964, the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1965, the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1994, and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. Additionally, the Canadian Press gives the Lionel Conacher Award to its male athlete of the year.

==Early life==
Conacher was born in Toronto, Ontario, on May 24, 1900. His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British Empire troops including Canadians were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. The family grew up in the neighbourhood of Davenport, which his brother Charlie described as &quot;one of Toronto&#x27;s higher class slums&quot;.
His father was a teamster, and struggled to earn enough money to support the family. In the winter, he ploughed the snow off outdoor skating rinks to earn additional money. Conacher left school after grade eight to go to work and help support his siblings. For ten hours a day, he hauled sod, earning an extra dollar a week for his family.

All ten children were encouraged to participate in sports by the principal of Jesse Ketchum School, who felt that such pursuits would keep his students from getting into trouble. Conacher discovered that he was among the better players in any sport he tried, and quickly became a star at Canadian football, ice hockey and lacrosse. He realized his athletic ability could offer an escape from poverty.

==Amateur career==
Conacher was a prolific athlete, excelling in numerous sports at the same time. He played with 14 different teams during his teenage years, winning 11 championships. In his youth, he played for Canadian Sports Hall of Fame coach, Bob Abate, and starred on Abate&#x27;s Elizabeth Playground teams. He was 16 years old when he won the Ontario lightweight wrestling championship, and at 20 won the Canadian amateur light-heavyweight boxing championship. In 1921, he fought, and was knocked out by heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey in an exhibition match. One year he famously hit a triple to win the Toronto city baseball championship, then rushed to the other side of the city to find his lacrosse team trailing 3–0 in the Ontario provincial final. He scored four goals and an assist to lead them to a comeback victory.

===Football===
Rugby football was the first sport Conacher played, and it was his favourite. He first played organized football at the age of 12 as a middle wing with the Capitals in the Toronto Rugby Football League. He played four seasons with the team between 1912 and 1915, during which the Capitals won the city championship each year. He won the Ontario championship as a junior with the Toronto Central YMCA in 1918, and in 1919 moved up to the intermediate level. With the intermediate Capitals, he was moved into an offensive role as a halfback. He excelled in the role, and his team reached Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) final. In that final, the Capitals&#x27; opponents from Sarnia made stopping Conacher their priority, a strategy that proved the difference as Sarnia won the championship.

Conacher moved to the senior level in 1920 with the Toronto Rugby Club where his team again won the ORFU championship, but lost the eastern semifinal to the Toronto Argonauts of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). His play impressed the Argonauts, who signed him for the 1921 season. In his first game with the Argonauts, he scored 23 of the team&#x27;s 27 points, and led the IRFU in scoring, accounting for 14 touchdowns and 90 of his team&#x27;s 167 points as they went undefeated in six games. The Argonauts won the eastern championship, and faced the Edmonton Eskimos in the first east–west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history. Conacher rushed for 211 yards and scored 15 points in Toronto&#x27;s 23–0 victory to claim the national title.

Named captain in 1922, Conacher led the Argonauts to another undefeated season in IRFU play, finishing with five wins and one tie, as he rushed for about 950 yards. The Argonauts reached the Eastern final, but lost to Queen&#x27;s University, 12–11. In that game, Conacher was the entire Argonaut offence, rushing 35 times for 227 yards but Pep Leadley&#x27;s 21-yard field goal towards the end of the game gave Queens&#x27; its victory.

===Ice hockey===
The expense of playing hockey initially kept Conacher off the ice. He did not learn to skate until he was 16. Consequently, hockey was among his weakest sports. He played with the Toronto Century Rovers, and then the Aura Lee Athletic Club, but saw limited ice time. Determined to improve his game, he closely watched the top players from the bench and sought to emulate what made them successful. His efforts paid off, and by 1918–19, was considered a star defenceman for Aura Lee. He joined the Toronto Canoe Club Paddlers, a team of all-star calibre players in 1919–20, and with them won the Memorial Cup, Canada&#x27;s national junior championship. Conacher then returned to the Aura Lees to play for their senior team for two years.

National Hockey League (NHL) teams took notice of Conacher&#x27;s ability. The Toronto St. Pats offered him $3,000 a season – three times the average salary – to play for them in 1920–21, while in 1921, the Montreal Canadiens offered $5,000 and support setting up a business. He turned both down as he was not yet willing to surrender his status as an amateur athlete. His decisions to refuse the offers led to speculation that he was being paid under the table. He and Billy Burch were accused of deliberately throwing a game in 1922, but were absolved of guilt by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada.

===Move to Pittsburgh===
Conacher remained in senior hockey and while playing for the North Toronto Seniors in 1923, was a part of the first hockey game broadcast on radio. That summer, he received an offer from Roy Schooley, the manager of the Duquesne Gardens and owner of the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the United States Amateur Hockey Association (USAHA), to play for his team. While he would retain his amateur status, Schooley set Conacher up with a job in the insurance business and paid his university tuition so that he could improve his education. He brought many of his teammates with him to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, all of whom received jobs in the community, and he attended school at Bellefonte Academy for a year before enrolling at Duquesne University.

He played football for both schools in the fall, and served as the Yellow Jackets&#x27; captain in the winter where he led the team to consecutive USAHA titles in 1924 and 1925. In the summers, Conacher returned to Toronto and played lacrosse and baseball. The Yellow Jackets turned professional in 1925 when they were renamed the Pittsburgh Pirates and joined the National Hockey League (NHL). Conacher finally chose to turn professional with the team, a decision that surprised fans and teammates in Toronto, who knew of his favouritism for the game of football.

==Professional career==

Conacher scored the first goal in Pirates history on American Thanksgiving Day Thursday November 26, 1925, against the Boston Bruins. He scored nine goals in 33 games in , then returned to Toronto to play professional baseball with the Toronto Maple Leafs. An outfielder on the team, Conacher and the Maple Leafs won the International League championship then defeated the Louisville Colonels to win the Little World Series.

He returned to Pittsburgh for the NHL season, but was dealt early in the year to the New York Americans in exchange for Charlie Langlois and $2,000. The trade nearly proved disastrous for Conacher. He scored 8 goals in and improved to 11 in , but playing for a team owned by notorious bootlegger Bill Dwyer resulted in his becoming a heavy drinker. Conacher served as player-coach in , but his play and health had deteriorated. Two events in that off-season saved Conacher: he swore off alcohol completely upon the birth of his first child, and his playing rights were sold to the Montreal Maroons.

Conacher periodically struggled with Montreal, and at one point was placed on waivers with no other team willing to take over his contract. Nonetheless, his overall play and point totals increased for three consecutive seasons with the Maroons, peaking at 28 points in . He was named to the second All-Star team that season, but was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Teddy Graham. Conacher was a key figure in the club&#x27;s first Stanley Cup victory that season. He finished second to the Canadiens&#x27; Aurel Joliat in the voting for the Hart Trophy and earned a spot on the NHL&#x27;s first All-Star team.

On Wednesday October 3, 1934, Conacher was involved in one of the largest transactions in league history. He was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens, along with Leroy Goldsworthy and Roger Jenkins in exchange for Montreal superstar Howie Morenz, Lorne Chabot and Marty Burke. The deal was only part of a series of trades involving four teams that represented one of the biggest deals in NHL history. Immediately following the Chicago trade, Conacher was sent back to the Maroons, along with Herb Cain, in exchange for the rights to Nelson Crutchfield. Conacher spent his last three NHL seasons with the Maroons and won his second Stanley Cup in 1935. He ended his hockey career after the team was eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Rangers on April 23, 1937. That final year he was runner-up to Babe Siebert in the 1937 Hart Trophy voting and was placed on the NHL second All-Star team.

===Canadian professional football===

Conacher had not played competitive football since turning professional. At one point he was offered a position as coach of the Montreal AAA Winged Wheelers, but disappointed the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union club when he turned down the job due to his other commitments. He was not absent from the game long, however, as Conacher returned to football in 1933. He was part of an effort to launch a new professional league that would feature both Canadian and American teams. The league never came to fruition, but Conacher organized what became the first professional football team in Canada. He captained the team, based out of Toronto, which was known as the Crosse and Blackwell Chefs following a sponsorship with a local food products company. Conacher recruited former amateur players who had likewise left the sport in favour of paying jobs in other pro sports, including his brother Charlie.

The first game was held Thanksgiving Day in 1933, an exhibition contest against the Rochester Arpeakos. A crowd of 10,000 attended the game to watch Conacher play his first competitive football game in Canada in ten years. He did not disappoint, scoring two touchdowns and setting up a third for the Chefs, and was hailed as the game&#x27;s star despite an 18–15 loss. Toronto lost a return match in Rochester, but in the third and final game of their season, the Chefs defeated a team from Buffalo at Toronto by a score of 18–0. Conacher was again the star, rushing for two touchdowns and scoring 13 of his team&#x27;s points. He organized the team for a second year in 1934, known as the Wrigley Aromints due to new sponsorship, and again played an exhibition schedule as the team remained unaffiliated with any league. The team again played three games, winning all three. However, at the age of 34 years, Conacher found that the game was too hard on his body physically, and neither he nor his team returned for a third season.

===Lacrosse===
Led by the owners of the Montreal Canadiens, the arena operators of Canada&#x27;s NHL teams invented the sport of box lacrosse in 1931 in a bid to fill arena dates in the summer. The field variant of the sport had been in decline in Canada as the popularity of baseball and football grew, and it was hoped that lacrosse played in the confines of a hockey rink would create a faster, more exciting game. A summer professional circuit, the International Professional Lacrosse League was created with representative teams of the Montreal Maroons, Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs and an entry from Cornwall, Ontario. Several NHL players who had played the field game before abandoning it to turn professional in hockey signed with the teams, including Conacher, who joined the Maroons. The Maroons&#x27; inaugural game came against the Maple Leafs, and though Toronto won 9–7, Conacher stole the spotlight from the victors. He scored six of Montreal&#x27;s goals, assisted on the seventh, and earned the praise of his fellow players. When the Maroons went to Toronto, the Maple Leafs hosted a &quot;Lionel Conacher Night&quot; to celebrate the city&#x27;s native son. The Maroons did not figure into the playoff for the championship, but Conacher led the league in scoring with 107 points. His dominance in the league was such that his total nearly doubled his nearest rival, who finished with 56 points. In one game, against Toronto, he scored ten goals in a 17–12 victory. He chose not to return to lacrosse for the 1932 season, choosing instead to sign a contract to wrestle professionally during the hockey off-seasons.

==Political career==

===Bracondale===
When Conacher retired from professional hockey, he ran as a Liberal in the 1937 Ontario general election. He was elected as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) representing the Toronto Bracondale electoral district in the Ontario Legislative Assembly, defeating the district&#x27;s incumbent, Conservative Arthur Russell Nesbitt. Bracondale had a colourful electoral past, and this election night was no different. The October 6 election was a very close race between Nesbitt and Conacher.

Conacher represented Bracondale from October 6, 1937, until June 30, 1943, when the Legislature was dissolved for the 1943 Ontario general election. He was challenged for the Liberal nomination in Bracondale by Toronto city alderman E. C. Bogart. Bogart won and then lost the seat to the Co-operative Commwealth&#x27;s Rae Luckock a few weeks later.

Conacher also served as the sports director for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) during World War II. He and Canadian Amateur Hockey Association past-president George Dudley, announced plans for military teams based at all RCAF commands across Canada to play in senior ice hockey leagues.

===Trinity===

In the 1945 Canadian general election, Conacher represented the Liberal Party of Canada for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, where he came second in Toronto&#x27;s Trinity electoral district, losing to the Progressive Conservative incumbent. He ran again in Trinity for the Liberals in the 1949 Canadian general election, and this time he was elected. He was re-elected for a final time in the 1953 election. Conacher was a friend of Justice Walter Robb, the chairman of the Ontario Liquor Licensing board. Conacher came to be influenced by the gangster Johnny Papalia as the police informer Marvin Elkind recalled in 2011: &quot;In those days, getting a liquor license was like printing money. Very few places had them. They were difficult to get and you had to get to Judge Robb. You just couldn&#x27;t go to Judge Robb yourself and pay him off. You had to go through somebody.. Smirle Lawson was one of his contacts. Charlie Conacher was one of his contracts. So if you wanted a liquor license in a bar or something, you would get to Judge Robb through these certain guys&quot;.

In the spring of 1954 Conacher was in Ottawa attending to his parliamentary duties when he was asked to play in the annual softball game between MPs and members of the parliamentary press gallery. On May 26, in the sixth inning, in his last at-bat-ever, he hit a long drive into left field, stretching a single into a triple, when he sprinted to third base. He stood, breathing heavily and then collapsed face-first from having been hit in the head with a pitch in an earlier inning. One of the other MPs was a doctor who tried to assist him, but there was little that could be done for Conacher and within twenty minutes he was pronounced dead. The next day Conacher was supposed to attend his daughter&#x27;s graduation from the University of Toronto. A big funeral was held, and his brother Charlie flew in from England to be there. He was buried at St. John&#x27;s York Mills Anglican Church Cemetery in Toronto.

==Awards==
He was named Canada&#x27;s Greatest Male Athlete of the Half-Century (1950). In 1981 the Pro Football Researchers Association called Conacher &quot;Canada&#x27;s Answer to Jim Thorpe&quot;. He is a member of the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame (1955), the Canadian Football Hall of Fame (1963), the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame (1966), and Hockey Hall of Fame (1994). The award for the Canadian Press Canadian male athlete of the year is called the Lionel Conacher Award.

==Family==
Conacher&#x27;s younger brothers, Charlie Conacher, and Roy Conacher, were also Hall of Fame hockey players. His namesake, Lionel Jr., was a first round draft pick in 1960 and played a season with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. His son Brian Conacher represented Canada at the 1964 Winter Olympics and played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, winning a Stanley Cup with them in 1966–67 NHL season. Pete Conacher, Lionel&#x27;s nephew and the son of Charlie, also played in the NHL, as did another nephew of Lionel&#x27;s, Murray Henderson, who was the son of Lionel&#x27;s sister Catherine. Former NHL player Cory Conacher is also a distant relative of Lionel&#x27;s.

<text>The Aparima River, earlier known as Jacob&#x27;s River, is one of the southward-flowing braided rivers of Southland, New Zealand.

==Description==
The Aparima has its headwaters in the Takitimu Mountains, south of Lake Te Anau, and flows south for before entering Foveaux Strait near Riverton at the north end of Oreti Beach. A Māori man lived at the mouth of the river who was called Jacob by local whalers, and &#x27;Jacob&#x27;s River&#x27; was in early use for both the river and the settlement that established itself.

It is one of the rivers responsible for the large alluvial plain known as the Southland Plains. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of the endangered black-billed gull.

<doc id="1103476" wikidata="Q1152505" url="?curid=1103476" title="Sherman Firefly">
<text>The Sherman Firefly was a medium tank used by the United Kingdom and some armoured formations of other Allies in the Second World War. It was based on the US M4 Sherman but was fitted with the more powerful British calibre 17-pounder anti-tank gun as its main weapon. Conceived as a stopgap until future British tank designs came into service, the Sherman Firefly became the most common vehicle mounting the 17-pounder in the war.

The British Army made extensive use of Sherman tanks, but they expected to have their own tank models developed soon, so the idea of mounting the 17-pounder in the Sherman was initially rejected. However, through the efforts of two persistent British officers, government reluctance was eventually overcome, and the Firefly went into production. This proved fortunate, as the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger and Cruiser Mk VIII Cromwell tank designs experienced difficulties and delays.

After the problem of getting such a large gun to fit in the Sherman&#x27;s turret was solved, the Firefly was put into production in early 1944, in time to equip the 21st Army Group, commanded by General Bernard Montgomery, for the Normandy landings. It soon became highly valued, as its gun could almost always penetrate the armour of the Panther and Tiger tanks it faced in Normandy, something no other British or American tank could reliably do. Because the Firefly&#x27;s barrel was visibly longer than that of a normal 75 mm Sherman, crews tried to countershade camouflage it so the tank would look like a regular Sherman from a distance. Between 2,100 and 2,200 were manufactured before production ended in 1945; it is unknown if this includes 100 tanks built for the United States.

== Origins ==
The idea of fitting a 17-pounder gun into a Sherman tank was rejected by the Ministry of Supply&#x27;s Tank Decision Board. Although the British Army had made extensive use of the American-built Sherman, it was intended that a new generation of British tanks would replace it. First, there was the Cromwell, which was expected to use the Vickers high-velocity 75 mm gun; this gun would have had superior anti-tank performance to the US 75 mm and 76 mm guns that were mounted in the Sherman. The second was the A30 Challenger, which was based on the Cromwell but with the even more powerful 17-pounder gun. These two tanks and their successors—the Comet and the Centurion, which were already on the drawing board—were to replace the Sherman in British service and the prospect of diverting resources to mount the 17-pounder on the Sherman seemed undesirable.

Major George Brighty of the Royal Tank Regiment was at the Lulworth Armoured Fighting School in early 1943. Despite the A30 Challenger undergoing initial trials at Lulworth, Brighty was convinced that the Sherman was a better mount for the 17-pounder. The turret of the Sherman was too small to allow for the very long recoil of the gun. In a radical adjustment, Brighty removed the recoil system and locked the gun in place, thus making the entire tank absorb the recoil, but this was a far from ideal situation and there was no telling how long the tank would have been able to handle such a set-up.

Around June 1943, a colleague of Brighty, Lieutenant Colonel George Witheridge of the Royal Tank Regiment, arrived at Lulworth. A veteran of the North Africa campaign, Witheridge had experienced first-hand the one-sided battles between British tanks armed with the 40 mm 2-pounder gun and Rommel&#x27;s formidable tanks and anti-tank guns. During the Battle of Gazala in mid-1942, Witheridge had been blown out of his M3 Grant medium tank and though he recovered from his wounds, he was declared unfit to return to combat duty. In January 1943, he was posted to Fort Knox in the United States for six months to advise on gunnery, where he was &quot;sold&quot; on the Sherman. While at Lulworth, Witheridge inspected the A30 Challenger and &quot;joined in the chorus of complaints&quot; about the tank. Upon looking up Brighty and learning of his attempts to improve the Sherman, Witheridge lent his assistance. He advised Brighty on methods to solve the recoil problem.

Not long after, Witheridge and Brighty received a notice from the Department of Tank Design (DTD) to cease their efforts. Unwilling to abandon the project, Witheridge, using his connections with such influential people as Major General Raymond Briggs, former General Officer Commanding the 1st Armoured Division in North Africa and then director of the Royal Armoured Corps, successfully lobbied Claude Gibb, Director-General of Weapons and Instruments Production at the Ministry of Supply, to make it an official ministry project. Gibb was able to explain to the detractors that not only was it possible but it should be doable in England. He had liaised with Colonel William Watson, who in late 1942 had returned from secondment to Australia to work on the production of the Australian AC1 Sentinel tank, onto which the 17-pounder had been mounted. With this development, the endeavor was taken out of the hands of the highly enthusiastic and devoted amateurs at Lulworth who had initiated it and given to professional tank developers.

== Design ==
W. G. K. Kilbourn, a Vickers engineer working for the DTD, transformed their idea into the reality of the prototype of the tank that would serve the British forces from the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The first thing he had to fix was the lack of a workable recoil system for the 17-pounder. The 17-pounder traveled back as it absorbed the recoil of the blast. This was too long for the Sherman&#x27;s turret. Kilbourn solved this problem by redesigning the recoil system completely rather than modifying it. The recoil cylinders were shortened and placed on both sides of the gun to take advantage of the width of the turret.

The gun breech itself was also rotated 90 degrees to allow loading from the left rather than from on top. The radio, normally mounted in the back of the turret in British tanks, had to be moved; an armoured box (a &quot;bustle&quot;) was attached to the back of the turret to house it, with access through a large hole cut through the turret.

The next problem encountered by Kilbourn was that the gun cradle, the metal block on which the gun sat, had to be shortened to allow the gun to fit into the Firefly and thus the gun itself was not very stable. Kilbourn had a new barrel designed for the 17-pounder that had a longer un-tapered section at the base, which helped solve the stability problem. A new mantlet was designed to house this gun and the modified cradle. The Firefly had no armour or mobility advantages over the normal Sherman tank beyond the additional 13 mm of protection added to its mantlet. The modifications were extensive enough that 17-pounders intended for the Firefly had to be factory-built specifically for it.

Kilbourn had to deal with additional complications. On the standard Sherman tank, there was a single hatch in the turret through which the commander, gunner, and loader entered and exited the tank. The 17-pounder&#x27;s larger breech and recoil system made it significantly more difficult for the loader to exit quickly; a new hatch was cut into the top of the turret over the gunner&#x27;s position to resolve this. The final major change was the elimination of the hull gunner in favour of space for more 17-pounder ammunition, which was longer than the original 75 mm.

By October and November 1943, enthusiasm began to grow for the project. The 21st Army Group was informed of the new tank in October. Even before final testing had taken place in February 1944, an order for 2,100 Sherman tanks armed with the 17-pounder gun was placed, as the Challenger program was suffering constant delays and it was realized that few would be ready for Normandy. Even worse, it was discovered that the Cromwell did not have a turret ring wide enough to take the new High Velocity 75 mm gun (50 calibres long), so it would have to be armed with the general purpose Ordnance QF 75 mm. This left the Firefly as the only tank available with firepower superior to the QF 75 mm gun in the British arsenal, earning it the &quot;highest priority&quot; from Winston Churchill.

==Name==
The nickname &quot;Firefly&quot; was adopted due to the bright muzzle flash of the main gun. During the war, Shermans with 17-pounder guns were usually known as &quot;1C&quot;, &quot;1C Hybrid&quot;, or &quot;VC&quot;, depending on the basic mark of the vehicle. In British nomenclature, a &quot;C&quot; at the end of the Roman numeral indicated a tank equipped with the 17-pounder.

The name &quot;Firefly&quot; in period sources often refers to any vehicle with a 17-pounder gun, often the 17pdr SP Achilles M10C variant of the M10 tank destroyer.

== Armament ==
The main armament of the Sherman Firefly was the Ordnance Quick-Firing 17-pounder. Designed as the successor to the British QF 6-pounder, the 17-pounder was the most powerful British tank gun of the war, and one of the most powerful of any nationality, being able to penetrate more armour than the 8.8 cm KwK 36 fitted to the German Tiger I. The 17-pounder was theoretically able to penetrate some of armour at and at using standard armour piercing, capped, ballistic capped (APCBC) ammunition. Armour piercing, discarding sabot (APDS) ammunition could penetrate some 256 mm of armor at 500 m and 233 mm at 1,000 m, which on paper could defeat the armour of almost every German armoured fighting vehicle at any likely range. However, war production APDS rounds lacked accuracy, and the 50 mm penetrator was less destructive after it had penetrated enemy tank armour than the 76.2 mm APCBC shell. APDS ammunition was rare until the post-war period. While the Sherman Firefly was capable of carrying 77 rounds of ammunition, the tank&#x27;s design features meant that only 23 rounds were easily and readily available when the tank was in action.

Though the 17-pounder had superior anti-tank capabilities, it lacked an effective HE round and was thus inferior to the standard Sherman 75 mm gun against soft targets, such as infantry, buildings and lightly armoured vehicles. As the war in Europe neared its close, the Allies found themselves encountering these more often than heavy German tanks. Allied tank units therefore typically refused to completely switch to Fireflies. A good HE shell for the gun only became available in late 1944 and even then was not as potent as the standard Sherman 75 mm HE shell.

Another problem was that the powerful blast from the 17-pounder gun kicked up large amounts of dirt as well as smoke, making it difficult for the gunner to observe the fall of the shot (and forcing him to rely on the commander to observe it and to order corrections) and revealing the position of the tank (forcing the Firefly to move every few shots). The recoil and muzzle blast could be severely jarring to Firefly crews and the muzzle blast frequently caused night blindness. The latter was a problem common to any tank armed with a high-velocity gun, including the Panther and Tiger I. The cramped turret meant that loading the large shell was difficult, so the Firefly had a slower rate of fire than a standard M4 Sherman. Since the Firefly was a stopgap, these problems were never eliminated, as it was supposed to be retired with the introduction of the new British tank designs such as the Comet and later Centurion.

The Firefly&#x27;s secondary armament was the standard 0.3 inch (7.62 mm) Browning M1919 machine gun coaxial in the turret, the hull-mounted machine gun being removed to increase ammunition storage for the main gun. A .50-inch (12.7 mm) M2 Browning heavy machine gun was also fitted on the turret roof, though many crews removed it, due to its awkward mounting and position near the commander, which limited a full 360-degree view when the hatch was open.

In 1945, some British Fireflies were fitted with a rail on either side of the turret for two RP-3 &quot;60lb&quot; high-explosive 3-inch rockets. Called &quot;Sherman Tulips&quot;, these were used at the Rhine crossing by the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards. The rockets, accurate when fired from aircraft, were less accurate when fired from a stationary platform, such as a tank, as they had little initial slipstream over the fins. The RP-3 was only effective when its 60-pound warhead hit the target.

== Production and distribution ==
Three different variants of Sherman Firefly served during the Second World War, each based on a different variant of the M4 Sherman. The Firefly conversion was carried out on Sherman I (M4), Sherman I Hybrid (M4 Composite), Sherman IV (M4A3, 65-68 built for the United States), and Sherman V (M4A4) tanks. Some sources state that several Sherman IIs (M4A1) were converted and used in action, but photos allegedly showing these conversions are in fact views of the front half of Sherman I Hybrid Fireflies. To complicate matters, a very small number of Canadian license-built Sherman IIs (M4A1), the Grizzly, were converted to Fireflies in Canada and used for training, but none saw action. The majority of Shermans converted were the Sherman V/M4A4 model, of which the British received about 7,200. The Sherman VC and IC variants are easily distinguished by their lower hulls; the VC having a lengthened hull, and larger gaps between the suspension units. They employed the three-piece bolted transmission housing. The Sherman IC usually had a cast transmission housing. The Hybrid can be distinguished by its upper hull, which is cast and gives it a distinctive curved look in comparison to the more boxy hull of a typical Sherman.

Production of the Firefly started in January 1944 and, by 31 May, some 342 Sherman Fireflies had been delivered to the 21st Army Group for the D-Day landings. British tank troops were composed of three units equipped with standard Shermans and one with Fireflys. The same distribution occurred in Cromwell units, but this caused logistical problems, as each Cromwell troop then needed to be supplied with parts for two different tanks. The Firefly was also slower than the Cromwell. Churchill units received no Fireflies, and as a result, often had to rely on any attached M10 or M10 Achilles units to provide increased firepower to deal with tanks their own guns could not handle.

Production was limited by the availability of suitable tanks, with the phasing out of 75 mm Sherman production. To make up numbers, Sherman I and Sherman I Hybrids were also converted. From D-Day in June to the end of the Battle of Normandy in late August, almost 400 Sherman Fireflies were converted, more than sufficient to replace any permanent tank losses during the battle. In late 1944, with the creation of an effective high-explosive shell for the 17-pounder gun, British units started to receive two Fireflies per troop. By February 1945, some 2,000 Sherman Fireflies had been built and British, Commonwealth, and Polish armoured units were equipped with a 50/50 mix of 75 mm and 17-pounder-armed Shermans.

In spring 1945, production of the Firefly was scaled down, with the last tank being delivered in May 1945. This was the result of several factors, from superior home-grown designs like the Comet and Centurion coming into service to replace the Firefly, to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany, and the inferior design of Japan&#x27;s tanks, which it seemed would be the next opponents the British would have to face after the fall of Germany.

Production of the Sherman Firefly reached some 2,100 – 2,200 tanks; exact numbers are hard to determine as documents give contradictory totals. &quot;Jane&#x27;s World War II Tanks and Fighting Vehicles&quot; gives a production of 1,783 vehicles in 1944 and 563 in 1945, for a total of 2,346. &quot;Sherman Firefly&quot; gives a number of 2,002 conversions made between January 1944 and February 1945 or a total of 2,139 conversions.

== Service ==
=== Normandy ===
Fireflies were introduced to armoured brigades and divisions in the 21st Army Group in 1944, just in time for the Normandy landings. The timing was fortunate as Allied intelligence had begun to realize in early 1944 through statistical analysis that the Germans were fielding a much larger number of more formidable tanks (such as the Panther) than had been anticipated. This information was slow to reach Allied military planners, who had mistakenly assumed the Panther, like the Tiger, would be a rare heavy tank with a limited production run, so the number of Panthers deployed came as a surprise to Allied formation commanders and tank crews forced to engage them with guns that could not penetrate the frontal armor except at short range.

Ken Tout, who served as a tank gunner and tank commander in the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry in Normandy in 1944, described the effect of mounting a 17-pounder in the Sherman:
Panthers and Tigers accounted for only about 126 of the 2,300 German tanks deployed in Normandy; the rest being Panzer IVs, Sturmgeschütz III tank destroyers and other armoured vehicles that the 75 mm Shermans could penetrate. The importance of Caen and Montgomery&#x27;s operations, which pinned German armoured forces in front of the British positions so the American units could break out to the west, meant that British and other Commonwealth units had to face over 70 percent of the German armour deployed during the Battle of Normandy, as well as over half of the elite, well-equipped Waffen-SS &quot;Panzer&quot; units. As a result, the Sherman Firefly was perhaps the most valued tank by British and other Commonwealth commanders, as it was the only tank in the British Army able to reliably penetrate the frontal armour of Panthers and Tigers at the standard combat ranges in Normandy.

This fact did not go unnoticed by the Germans, who realized that these long-barrel Shermans posed a much greater threat to their heavy tanks than the normal Shermans, and German tank crews and anti-tank gun crews were instructed to eliminate Fireflies first. Similarly, the Firefly crews realized that the distinctive long barrel of their 17-pounder gun made their Fireflies stand out from standard Shermans, so they attempted to disguise their tanks to reduce the likelihood of being targeted. Some crews had the front half of the olive drab gun barrel painted white on the bottom, or white with dark green on top, to give the illusion of a shorter gun barrel. Another suggestion was for a shorter wooden dummy gun to be mounted on the rear of the turret and point forward; however, this tactic does not appear to have been used in combat.
Despite being a high-priority target, Fireflies appear to have had a statistically lower chance of being knocked out than standard Shermans, probably due more to how they were employed than to the effectiveness of the camouflaging of the long barrel. Given the high value placed on Fireflies, a common tactic was for commanders to reconnoitre the battlefield before a battle, to look for good overwatch positions. During the battle, Fireflies would stay behind in those positions and cover the ordinary Shermans as they pushed forward, eliminating any enemy tanks that revealed themselves when they opened fire on the advancing Shermans, and moving forward only when the standard Shermans had secured the area or when the Fireflies could no longer cover them. Similarly, when on the move, troop commanders tended to position Fireflies in the rear to reduce the chance of their being knocked out. Given the relatively unpredictable nature of battle, this was not always possible and many times, Fireflies were forced to engage enemies in the open, where they could be identified.

Despite this, the Firefly&#x27;s increased firepower was much valued, and during many engagements, the Firefly proved its worth, knocking out Tigers and Panthers at long range, as well as less formidable tanks such as Panzer IVs and StuG tank destroyers.

====Norrey-en-Bessin====
One example of this increased firepower was displayed by Lt. G. K. Henry&#x27;s Firefly during the defence of Norrey-en-Bessin on 9 June against an attack by the 3rd Company of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment of the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;. Determined to capture the village in preparation for a larger offensive to drive the British and Canadians back into the sea, Kurt Meyer ordered 12 Panthers of the 3rd Company and infantry to attack Norrey and drive out the Canadians. The attack got underway at 1300 hours, with the Panthers racing towards the town at full speed, stopping only to fire their guns. They quickly outran their infantry support, which was forced to ground by Allied artillery fire. Within of the village, nine standard Shermans of the Canadian 6th Canadian Armoured Regiment opened fire into the advancing Panthers&#x27; flanks. Lt. Henry&#x27;s gunner, Trooper A. Chapman, waited until the Panthers &quot;lined up like ducks in a row&quot; and quickly knocked out five Panthers with just six rounds. The attack was repulsed with the loss of seven of the 12 Panthers.

====Tilly-sur-Seulles====
A similar event occurred on 14 June, during Operation Perch. Sgt. Harris of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, along with three standard Shermans, set up defensive positions along with the infantry after capturing the village of Lingèvres, near Tilly-sur-Seulles, France. Looking through his binoculars, Sgt. Harris spotted two Panthers advancing from the east. He opened fire at a range of , knocking out the lead Panther with his first shot, and the other with his second. Relocating to a well-concealed flanking position on the other side of the town, he spotted another three Panthers approaching from the west. He and his gunner, Trooper Mackillop, knocked them out with three rounds.

====Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil====
In perhaps their most famous action, British and Canadian Fireflies defeated the heavy armour of a German counterattack at Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil during Operation Totalize on 8 August 1944, resulting in the destruction of five Tiger tanks and the death of the attack&#x27;s leader, the noted German tank commander Michael Wittmann. The battle involved Fireflies from A Squadron, 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, 33rd Armoured Brigade; A Squadron, the Sherbrooke Fusiliers Regiment, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and B Squadron, The 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, 33rd Armoured Brigade. They ambushed a group of seven Tiger tanks from the 3rd Company and HQ Company, 101st SS Heavy Tank Battalion supported by Panzer IV tanks and StuG IV assault guns, which were attempting to retake the high ground. The tanks of the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry reached the French village of Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil on the morning of 8 August 1944. While B Squadron stayed around the village, A and C Squadrons moved further south into a wood called Delle de la Roque.

C Squadron positioned themselves on the east side of the woods and the under-strength A Squadron in the southern portion with No. 3 Troop on the western edge of the wood. From this position, they overlooked a large open section of ground and were able to watch as German tanks advanced up Route Nationale 158 from the village of Cintheaux. They held their fire until the German tanks were well within range. Joe Ekins, the gunner of Sergeant Gordon&#x27;s Sherman Firefly (&quot;Velikiye Luki&quot; – A Squadron&#x27;s tanks were named after towns in the Soviet Union) had yet to fire his gun in action. With the Tigers in range, a 12-minute exchange of fire commenced that saw Ekins destroy all three Tigers that No. 3 Troop could see. A short time later, the main German counterattack was made in the direction of C Squadron. A Squadron (less Sgt Gordon, who had been wounded and had already bailed out of the Firefly) moved over to support them and Ekins destroyed a Panzer IV before his tank was hit and the crew were forced to bail out.

=== Italy ===
Although the Normandy campaign had priority, Fireflies also served with distinction in British, Commonwealth and Polish units in the Italian campaign. British units in Italy also used the Sherman with the US 76 mm gun M1.

=== Post-war use ===
==== Argentina ====
In 1947, the Argentine Army purchased surplus armament that was stored in Belgium, including some 200 Sherman Fireflies of all sub-types; they were in use from 1948. Starting in 1959, 150 Fireflies Mk.V had their original Chrysler A57 engine substituted for a Ford GAA V8, to improve reliability; these remained in service until the mid-1970s. Due to increase in regional conflicts, the Fireflies were up-graded to the &quot;Sherman Repotenciado&quot; standard, which included a new gun (derived from the French CN-105-57) and a new engine (the French diesel Poyaud 520/V8-S2); the first units were incorporated in January 1978.

==== Paraguay ====
In 1971, the Argentine Army transferred to the Paraguayan Army three upgraded Fireflies; these were exchanged in 1988 for three &quot;Sherman Repotenciados&quot; recently decommissioned.

====Lebanon====
In 1949, the Lebanese Army purchased 16 Firefly Mk Vc tanks from Italy as scrap. These tanks first saw action during the 1958 Lebanon crisis, being subsequently retired from frontline service and replaced by 18 M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tanks provided by the United States. The Lebanese Shermans remained in reserve storage until 1976, when two of them were seized by the Al-Mourabitoun militia and the remaining 14 taken by the Lebanese Arab Army (LAA), which were employed by these two factions in the Lebanese Civil War. All the vehicles were returned to Lebanese Army ownership in 1977-78 when they were finally decommissioned.

<doc id="1103482" wikidata="Q3536974" url="?curid=1103482" title="P. B. Sreenivas">
<text>Prathivadhi Bhayankara Sreenivas (22 September 1928 – 14 April 2013) widely known as P. B. S. was an Indian playback singer, composer, harmonium player, Lyricist and poet known for his works in South cinema, and Bollywood. His major chunk of work has been in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu languages, though he sang many songs in Malayalam and Hindi too. He has garnered the Kannada Rajyotsava Prashasti, the Tamil Kalaimamani Award, and the Madhavapeddi Satyam Award by the Andhra Siva Foundation, for his contributions to music and cinema. 

In his honor, &quot;Sri Kala Sudha Telugu Association&quot; of Chennai, instituted the &quot;P. B. Sreenivas Mahapurush Award&quot; to honor veteran singers.

==Early life==
Prathivadhi Bhayankara Sreenivas was born into a Telugu speaking Hindu musical family Prathivadhi Bhayankara Phanindraswamy and Seshagiriamma as their younger son in Kakinada, East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh. His father was a civil servant and his mother was a musician. His father wanted him to become a government officer and Sreenivas was awarded a Bachelor of Commerce degree and then passed the &quot;Hindi Visharad&quot; from the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha.

==Musical career==
His uncle, Kidambi Krishnaswamy, was a drama artist and a singer. When Sreenivas was 12, Krishnaswamy gave him a chance to sing in a drama. Later, Sreenivas, a trained harmonium player and singer, went to Gemini Studios, Madras. Emani Sankara Sastry, a veena player, was one of the residing musicians. He introduced Sreenivas to S. S. Vasan, the owner of Gemini Studios. There, Sreenivas sang a super hit song sung by Mohammed Rafi, his favourite singer. It was &quot;Huye Hum Jinke Liye Barbad&quot;, from &quot;Deedar&quot; (1951), composed by Naushad Ali, which landed him the opportunity to become professional playback singer.

==Voice of Dr. Rajkumar==
PBS has sung at least 300 super hit numbers for Rajkumar. The actor once described Sreenivas as his &quot;Shàreera&quot; (voice in Kannada) while he himself was a mere &quot;Sharira&quot; (body in Kannada), summing up how some of the best-known films of the actor are unimaginable without Sreenivas lending his voice.

Until 1974, Sreenivas was Rajkumar&#x27;s most frequent singing voice in films. However, once when Sreenivas was not available to sing for the movie Sampattige Sawaal, Composer G K Venkatesh encouraged Rajkumar to sing the song &quot;Yaare Koogadali&quot; that was supposed to be sung by Sreenivas. With that song, Rajkumar restarted his singing career, which had stopped after the movie Ohileshwara. Thus began his journey as the most famous actor-singer that Kannada film industry has ever seen.

==Biography on PBS ==

The biography titled &quot;Madhurya Saarvabhowma Dr. P. B. Srinivas-Naadayogiya Sunaadayaana&quot; (penned by R. Srinath, Publishers: Surabhi Prakashana, Bengaluru) was released on 7 May 2013 at the Palace Grounds, Bangalore by the singers S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Vani Jairam and K. J. Yesudas.

==Awards==
* The second highest award of Karnataka State, the Kannada Rajyothsava Award awarded by the chief minister of the state
* The Tamil Nadu state&#x27;s honorary Kalaimamani Award
* Dr. Rajkumar Souhardha award given by the super star&#x27;s family
*The prestigious &quot;Karnataka Nadoja Award&quot; - constituted by Kannada University, Hampi, Karnataka awarded by the governor of Karnataka
* Tamil Nadu State Film Honorary Award - Kalaivanar Award in 2002
==Filmography==
===Tamil songs===
==Death==
Sreenivas died of a massive heart attack at home in Chennai on 14 April 2013 at the age of 84. He was cremated on the next day. He was survived by his wife and children.

<doc id="1103485" wikidata="Q3134218" url="?curid=1103485" title="Blaydon (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Blaydon was a constituency represented in the House of Commons from 2017 until its abolition for the 2024 general election by Liz Twist of the Labour Party.

==Constituency profile==
The seat was a safe seat for the Labour Party from 1935 until its abolition.

Historically, the area&#x27;s economy relied on coal mining from the Victorian period until the decline of mining in the latter half of the 20th century.

By 2024, the economy was supported by engineering and service industries on Tyneside, and agriculture. It also included the Metrocentre, the second-largest shopping centre in the UK. 

The constituency was on the western upland outskirts of Gateshead and with communities separated by green buffers. It comprised the towns of Blaydon, Whickham, Ryton, Birtley and surrounding villages in the south and west of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.

==Boundaries==

=== 1918–1950 ===

* The Urban Districts of Blaydon, Ryton, Tanfield, and Whickham.

&quot;Blaydon was created under the Representation of the People Act 1918 for the 1918 general election when Blaydon, Ryton and Whickham were split off from the existing Chester-le-Street seat. Tanfield was added from the abolished constituency of North West Durham.&quot;

=== 1950–1983 ===

* The Urban Districts of Blaydon, Ryton, and Whickham.

&quot;Tanfield transferred to Consett.&quot;

=== 1983–2010 ===

* The Borough of Gateshead wards of Birtley, Blaydon, Chopwell and Rowlands Gill, Crawcrook and Greenside, Lamesley, Ryton, Whickham North, Whickham South, and Winlaton.

&quot;The communities of Birtley and Lamesley were transferred in from the abolished constituency of Chester-le-Street. Lost small area in the east of the seat to the new constituency of Tyne Bridge.&quot;

=== 2010–2024===
* The Borough of Gateshead wards of Birtley, Blaydon, Chopwell and Rowlands Gill, Crawcrook and Greenside, Dunston Hill and Whickham East, Lamesley, Ryton, Crookhill and Stella, Whickham North, Whickham South and Sunniside, and Winlaton and High Spen.

&quot;Minor changes resulting from the redrawing of ward boundaries in Gateshead Borough and abolition of Tyne Bridge.&quot;

== Abolition ==
Further to the completion of the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished for the 2024 general election, with its contents distributed to three new constituencies:

* The three wards incorporating the town of Whickham included in an expanded Gateshead constituency named Gateshead Central and Whickham
* Birtley and Lamesley combined with Washington to form Washington and Gateshead South
* Remaining wards (comprising about half the electorate), including the communities of Blaydon, Rowlands Gill and Ryton, to form a cross-county constituency with Consett in County Durham - named Blaydon and Consett

<text>This is a list of bishops and patriarchs of Aquileia in northeastern Italy. For the ecclesiastical history of the diocese, see Patriarchate of Aquileia.

From 553 until 698 the archbishops renounced Papal authority as part of the Schism of the Three Chapters and when they returned to the Roman fold they maintained the title patriarch which was adopted during this schism.

The Patriarchs gained the Countship of Friuli and the March of Carniola in 1077 and the March of Istria in 1209. The temporal authority of the patriarchate was lost on 7 July 1420 when its territories were secularized by Venice.

The Patriarchate was dissolved in 1751 and its ecclesiastical authority divided between the Archbishop of Gorizia (Görz) and the Archbishop of Udine.

<doc id="1103499" wikidata="Q311387" url="?curid=1103499" title="Anton Reicha">
<text>Anton (Antonín, Antoine) Joseph Reicha (Rejcha) (26 February 1770 – 28 May 1836) was a Czech-born, Bavarian-educated, later naturalized French composer and music theorist. A contemporary and lifelong friend of Beethoven, he is now best remembered for his substantial early contributions to the wind quintet literature and his role as teacher of pupils including Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz and César Franck. He was also an accomplished theorist, and wrote several treatises on various aspects of composition. Some of his theoretical work dealt with experimental methods of composition, which he applied in a variety of works such as fugues and études for piano and string quartet.

None of the advanced ideas he advocated in the most radical of his music and writings, such as polyrhythm, polytonality and microtonal music, were accepted or employed by other nineteenth-century composers. Due to Reicha&#x27;s unwillingness to have his music published (like Michael Haydn before him), he fell into obscurity soon after his death and his life and work have yet to be intensively studied.

== Life ==

=== 1770–1805: early years, first visit to Paris and the Viennese period ===
Reicha was born in Prague. His father Šimon, the town piper of the city, died when Anton was just 10 months old. Apparently Reicha&#x27;s mother was not interested in her son&#x27;s education, and so in 1780 he ran away from home following a sudden impulse – as he recounted in his memoirs, he jumped onto a passing carriage. He first visited his paternal grandfather in Klatovy, and then his paternal uncle Josef Reicha, a virtuoso cellist, conductor and composer living in Wallerstein, Bavaria, who adopted him. Josef and his wife, being childless, could give young Anton their full attention: Josef taught him violin and piano, his wife insisted on him being taught French and German, and he was also taught the flute.

In 1785 the family moved to Bonn, where Reicha became a member of the Hofkapelle of Max Franz, Elector of Cologne, playing violin and second flute in the court orchestra under his uncle&#x27;s direction. The young Beethoven entered the Hofkapelle as violist and organist in 1789 and Reicha befriended him. Christian Gottlob Neefe, one of the most important figures in the musical life of the city at the time, may well have instructed both Reicha and his gifted piano pupil Beethoven in composition and introduced them to the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, such as &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;.

From about 1785 Reicha studied composition secretly, against his uncle&#x27;s wishes, composing and conducting his first symphony in 1787 and entering the University of Bonn in 1789, where he studied and performed until 1794, when Bonn was attacked and captured by the French. He managed to escape to Hamburg, vowed never to perform in public again and began to earn a living teaching harmony, composition and piano. He continued composing and studied mathematics, philosophy and, significantly, methods of teaching composition. In 1799 he moved to Paris, hoping to achieve success as an opera composer. These hopes were dashed, however: he could neither get his old librettos accepted nor find suitable new ones despite support from friends and influential members of the aristocracy, and moved on to Vienna in 1801.

Once there, like Beethoven and the young Schubert, he studied with Antonio Salieri and Johann Georg Albrechtsberger. Both were renowned teachers, and Albrechtsberger was also an important theorist and acknowledged authority on counterpoint and fugal theory. Reicha called on Haydn, whom he had met several times in Bonn and Hamburg during the 1790s, and renewed his friendship with Beethoven, whom he had not seen since 1792, when the latter moved from Bonn to Vienna. At this time (late 1802–1803) Beethoven&#x27;s Eroica symphony was in gestation, and it is likely that the two men exchanged ideas on fugues in modern composition. Reicha&#x27;s move to Vienna marked the beginning of a more productive and successful period in his life. As he wrote in his memoirs, &quot;The number of works I finished in Vienna is astonishing. Once started, my verve and imagination were indefatigable. Ideas came to me so rapidly it was often difficult to set them down without losing some of them. I always had a great penchant for doing the unusual in composition. When writing in an original vein, my creative faculties and spirit seemed keener than when following the precepts of my predecessors.&quot; In 1801, Reicha&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;ouragan&quot;, which failed in Paris, was performed at the palace of Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz, a prominent patron of Beethoven. Empress Maria Theresa (of Naples and Sicily) commissioned another opera after this performance, &quot;Argine, regina di Granata&quot;, which was only privately performed. His studies in Hamburg came to fruition here with the publication of several semi-didactic, encyclopedic works such as &quot;36 Fugues for piano&quot; (published in 1803, dedicated to Haydn) and &quot;L&#x27;art de varier&quot;, a large-scale variation cycle (composed in 1803/04 for Prince Louis Ferdinand), and the treatise &quot;Practische Beispiele&quot; (published in 1803), which contained 24 compositions.

=== 1806–1836: departure from Vienna and life in Paris ===
Reicha&#x27;s life and career in Vienna were interrupted by Napoleon&#x27;s November 1805 occupation of the city by French troops. In 1806 Reicha travelled to Leipzig to arrange a performance of his new work, the cantata &quot;Lenore&quot; (stopping at Prague to see his mother for the first time since 1780), but because Leipzig was blockaded by the French, not only was the performance cancelled but he could not return to Vienna for several months. When he did return it was not for long, because by 1808 the Austrian Empire was already preparing for another war, the War of the Fifth Coalition, so Reicha decided to move back to Paris. He was soon teaching composition privately, future prolific composer George Onslow being one of his pupils by 1808. This time three of his many operas were produced, but they all failed; yet his fame as theorist and teacher increased steadily, and by 1817 most of his pupils became professors at the Conservatoire de Paris. The following year, Reicha himself was appointed professor of counterpoint and fugue at the Conservatoire with the support of Louis XVIII, despite opposition from its influential professor of composition and (from 1822) director Luigi Cherubini 

This second Paris period produced several important theoretical writings. &quot;Cours de composition musicale&quot;, published by 1818, became the standard text on composition at the Conservatoire; the &quot;Traité de mélodie&quot; of 1814, a treatise on melody, was also widely studied. Another semi-didactic work, &quot;34 Études for piano&quot;, was published by 1817. It was also in Paris that Reicha started composing the 25 wind quintets which proved to be his most enduring works: far more conservative musically than the experimental fugues he had written in Vienna, but exploiting the skill of his virtuosi from the Opéra Comique to extend significantly the technique and musical ambitions of future players of the still evolving wind instruments. In 1818 he married Virginie Enaust, who bore him two daughters. Around this time he taught composition to the future pioneer of the modern oboe Henri Brod, and in 1819 he began teaching harmony and music theory to Louise Farrenc; after interrupting her studies for her own marriage, she completed studies at the Paris Conservatory with Reicha in 1825.

Reicha stayed in Paris for the rest of his life. He became a naturalized citizen of his adopted country in 1829 and Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1835. That same year, he succeeded François-Adrien Boieldieu at the Académie Française. He published two more large treatises, &quot;Traité de haute composition musicale&quot; (1824–1826) (Treatise on advanced musical composition) and &quot;Art du compositeur dramatique&quot; (1833) (Art of dramatic composition), on writing opera. His ideas expressed in the former work sparked some controversy at the Conservatoire. In 1826 Franz Liszt, Hector Berlioz and Henri Cohen became students of his, as did composers Charles Gounod and Pauline Viardot sometime later. Berlioz in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; acknowledges that Reicha was &#x27;an admirable teacher of counterpoint&#x27; who cared about his pupils and whose &#x27;lessons were models of integrity and thoroughness&#x27; – high praise indeed from one so critical of the Conservatoire in general. Frédéric Chopin considered studying with him in December 1831 shortly after arriving in Paris from his native Poland, but ultimately decided otherwise. From June 1835 until Reicha&#x27;s death in May 1836, the young César Franck took private lessons. His notebooks survive (in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris) with Reicha&#x27;s annotations (and a later cryptic comment possibly by Erik Satie), showing how hard Reicha worked his 13-year-old pupil. Reicha was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, and Luigi Cherubini resumed the teaching of counterpoint at the Conservatoire, replacing Reicha&#x27;s heretical work on fugue with his own as the standard text.

== Works ==
It is difficult to present a coherent list of Reicha&#x27;s works, because the opus numbers assigned to them at the time of publication are in disarray, some pieces were supposedly lost, and many works were published several times, sometimes as part of larger collections. His surviving oeuvre covers a vast array of genres and forms, from opera to piano fugues. He is best known today for his 25 wind quintets, composed in Paris between 1811 and 1820, which were mostly premiered from 1817 in the foyer of the Théâtre Favart by some of the world&#x27;s finest wind soloists, to such effect that they were played all over Europe shortly afterward. Reicha claimed in his memoirs that his wind quintets filled a void: &quot;At that time, there was a dearth not only of good classic[al] music, but of any good music at all for wind instruments, simply because the composers knew little of their technique.&quot; Indeed, Reicha&#x27;s experiences as a flautist must have helped in the creation of these pieces, in which he systematically explored the possibilities of the wind ensemble and invented an extended sonata form variant that could accommodate as many as five principal themes. Reicha wrote his first experimental quintet in 1811; the &#x27;incomparably superior&#x27; first two of the later published quintets of Opus 88 were written by 1814 after further study of the instruments and collaboration with his players, with the remaining four completed before publication in 1817. Three further sets of six were published as Opus 91 in 1818, Opus 99 in 1819 and Opus 100 in 1820.

Musically, the wind quintets represent a more conservative trend in Reicha&#x27;s oeuvre when compared to his earlier work, namely the compositions of the Viennese period. In the quintets, as he describes in his preface, Reicha wanted to expand the technical limits of the five still evolving wind instruments (hand horn, &#x27;un-rationalised&#x27; flute and clarinet, double reeds with fewer keys), and thereby also the ambitions of amateur wind players, by establishing a nucleus for a corpus of substantial work like that available to string players (and consciously more serious than the Harmoniemusik of the last century). His writing combines virtuoso display (often still very challenging today, yet idiomatic for each instrument), popular elements (from the comic opera his soloists played, from his Bohemian folk heritage, from the military background to his life – many marches, &#x27;walking&#x27; themes and fanfares), and his lifelong more academic interests in variation form and counterpoint. Four of the quintets have trios in passacaglia form, the repeating theme however being on different instruments in each case so not necessarily in the bass. The earlier Beethoven connection, now severed, is revisited in the scherzo of the quintet in E-flat Op. 100 no. 3, which contains clear musical quotations (most obvious in the horn part) from both the scherzo of his Eroica (also in E-flat major) and the first movement of his 5th symphonies. Berlioz says the quintets &quot;enjoyed a certain vogue in Paris for a number of years. They are interesting pieces but a little cold&quot;, while Louis Spohr, who was visiting Paris in 1820–21 and reserved judgment until he had heard several performed, assessed them in a letter home (which he included in his autobiography) as having too many ideas linked carelessly or not at all (&quot;were he less rich, he would be richer&quot;), &quot;yet the minuets and scherzi, as short pieces, are less open to this objection, and some of them are real masterpieces in form and contents&quot;. Spohr was generally impressed by the virtuosity of the wind soloists and was very pleased with their performance of his own piano and wind quintet. Berlioz also comments on two of the players (in other works): &quot;, the first flute...has to dominate...so he transposes the flute line up an octave, thus destroying the composer&#x27;s intention&quot; (p. 56); of Gustave Vogt&#x27;s cor anglais playing he says (p. 23): &quot;However remarkable the singer...I find it hard to believe she can ever have made it sound as natural and touching as it did on Vogt&#x27;s instrument&quot;. Reicha was particularly close personally to the horn player L-F Dauprat, who was nominated by the family&#x27;s lawyer as a surrogate guardian to Reicha&#x27;s two daughters at his death.

Technical wizardry also prevails in compositions that illustrate Reicha&#x27;s theoretical treatise &quot;Practische Beispiele&quot; (Practical Examples) of 1803, where techniques such as bitonality and polyrhythm are explored in extremely difficult sight-reading exercises. &quot;36 fugues for piano&quot;, published in 1803, was conceived as an illustration of Reicha&#x27;s &quot;neue Fugensystem&quot;, i.e. those new ideas about fugues which had piqued Beethoven. Reicha proposed that second entries of fugue subjects in major keys could occur in keys other than the standard dominant), to widen the possibilities for modulations and undermine the conservative tonal stability of the fugue. The fugues of the collection not only illustrate this point, but also employ a variety of extremely convoluted technical tricks such as polyrhythm (no. 30), combined (nos. 24, 28), asymmetrical (no. 20) and simply uncommon (no. 10 is in 12/4, no. 12 in 2/8) meters and time signatures, some of which are derived from folk music, an approach that directly anticipates that of later composers such as Béla Bartók. No. 13 is a modal fugue played on white keys only, in which cadences are possible on all but the 7th degree of the scale without further alteration. Six fugues employ two subjects, one has three, and No. 15 has six. In several of the fugues, Reicha established a link with the old tradition by using subjects by Haydn (no. 3), Bach (no. 5), Mozart (no. 7), Scarlatti (no. 9), Frescobaldi (no. 14) and Handel (no. 15). Many of the technical accomplishments are unique to fugue literature.

The études of op. 97, &quot;Études dans le genre fugué&quot;, published in Paris by 1817, are similarly advanced. Each composition is preceded by Reicha&#x27;s comments for young composers. Thirty of the 34 études included are fugues, and every étude is preceded by a prelude based on a particular technical or compositional problem. Again an exceptionally large number of forms and textures is used, including, for example, the variation form with extensive use of invertible counterpoint (no. 3), or an Andante in C minor based on the famous Folia harmonic progression. Reicha&#x27;s massive cycle of variations, &quot;L&#x27;art de varier&quot;, uses the same pedagogical principle and includes variations in the form of four-voice fugues, program music variations, toccata-like hand-crossing variations, etc., foreshadowing in many aspects not only Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;, but also works by Schubert, Wagner and Debussy.

Many of Reicha&#x27;s string quartets are similarly advanced, and also anticipate numerous later developments. The eight Vienna string quartets (1801–1805) are among his most important works. Though largely ignored since Reicha&#x27;s death, they were highly influential during his lifetime and left their mark on the quartets of Beethoven and Schubert, much as Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; was ignored by the public but well known to Beethoven and Chopin. Reicha also wrote prolifically for various kinds of ensembles other than wind quintets and string quartets, including violin sonatas, piano trios, horn trios, flute quartets, various works for solo wind or string instruments accompanied by strings, and works for voice. He also wrote in larger-scale genres, including at least eight known symphonies, seven operas, and choral works such as a Requiem.

Much of Reicha&#x27;s music remained unpublished and/or unperformed during his life, and virtually all of it fell into obscurity after his death. This is partly explained by Reicha&#x27;s own decisions he reflected on in his autobiography: &quot;Many of my works have never been heard because of my aversion to seeking performances [...] I counted the time spent in such efforts as lost, and preferred to remain at my desk.&quot; He also frequently advocated ideas, such as the use of quarter tones, that were too far ahead of his time to be understood by his contemporaries.

== Writings ==

Reicha&#x27;s major theoretical and pedagogical works include the following:
* &quot;Practische Beispiele: ein Beitrag zur Geistescultur des Tonsetzers ... begleitet mit philosophisch-practischen Anmerkungen&quot; (1803), a didactic work that includes 25 sight-reading exercises of extreme difficulty, some of which were later published separately or in collections such as the &quot;36 fugues&quot;. The exercises are divided into three groups: one for polyrhythm, one for polytonality and one that included exercises written on four staves and so required knowledge of the alto and tenor clefs.
* &quot; (Paris, 1814), on melody, translated into German by Czerny
* &quot; (1818), on composition, translated into German by Czerny (From Chapter 9 of Czerny&#x27;s Letters to a Young Lady: &quot;My view was only to give you a general idea of Harmony or Thorough Bass; and when you begin the study of it in a regular manner – and I hear with pleasure that you are shortly about to do so, and that your worthy teacher has selected for the purpose the excellent Treatise on Harmony by Reicha...&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (2 vols. 1824–1826), translated into German by Czerny around 1835. In this late treatise Reicha expressed some of his most daring ideas, such as the use of quarter tones and folk music (which was almost completely neglected at the time). An article in this treatise deals with the problem of irregular resolution of dissonant chords, formulating a simple law for its successful employment; this article was so innovative and celebrated, that it was published even by itself in the past and in the present, the latest English translation being the one by Lorenzo M. A. Giorgi (&quot;A new theory for the resolution of discords, according to the Modern Musical System&quot;, 2017).
* &quot;&quot; (4 vols., 1833), on the writing of opera. Provides an exhaustive account of contemporary performance techniques and is supplemented with examples from Reicha&#x27;s own operas.

In addition to these, a number of smaller texts by him exist. These include an outline of Reicha&#x27;s system for writing fugues, &quot;Über das neue Fugensystem&quot; (published as a foreword to the 1805 edition of &quot;36 fugues&quot;), &quot;Sur la musique comme art purement sentimental&quot; (before 1814, literally &quot;On music as a purely emotional art&quot;), &quot;Petit traité d&#x27;harmonie pratique à 2 parties&quot; (c. 1814, a short &quot;practical treatise&quot; on harmony), a number of articles and the poem &quot;An Joseph Haydn&quot;, published in the preface to &quot;36 fugues&quot; (which were dedicated to Haydn).

<text>Charny () is a district (&quot;secteur&quot;) within the Les Chutes-de-la-Chaudière-Est borough of the city of Lévis, Quebec. It is located on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, south of Quebec City. Formerly an independent city, Charny was merged with Lévis on January 1, 2002.

==History==
Over the last century, Charny has been tremendously influenced socially and economically by the Canadian National Railway which maintains a major national train yard in the town, Joffre Yard. The roundhouse in the yard was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1992.

Charny expanded in population during the late 1980s and early 1990s when new neighbourhoods were surveyed and houses were built.

Charny has reached regional exposure many times over the last twenty years struggling with Alex Couture Inc., a plant which buys animal corpses in order to recycle them, producing salable by-products. The plant generated bad smells and odours throughout the city. The plant has installed filters to screen out any odours.

There is a waterfall that is located in the town on the Chaudière River. It offers a beautiful scene as well as a long narrow suspension bridge that one can walk across to get to the other side of the river (Saint-Rédempteur).

==Demographics==
Population according to 2006 Canadian census:

*Population: 10,367
*% Change 2001-2006: -1.3
*Dwellings: 4,686
*Density per km2: 1,284.6
*Area per km2: 8.07

==Education==
Charny is within the Commission scolaire des Navigateurs, which operates the École secondaire les Etchemins.

<doc id="1103509" wikidata="Q2320981" url="?curid=1103509" title="Williamite War in Ireland">
<text>The Williamite War in Ireland took place from March 1689 to October 1691. Fought between Jacobite supporters of James II and those of his successor, William III, it resulted in a Williamite victory. It is generally viewed as a related conflict of the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years&#x27; War.

The November 1688 Glorious Revolution replaced the Catholic James with his Protestant daughter Mary II and her husband William, who ruled as joint monarchs of England, Ireland, and Scotland. However, James retained considerable support in largely Catholic Ireland, where it was hoped he would address long-standing grievances on land ownership, religion, and civic rights.

The war began in March 1689 with a series of skirmishes between James&#x27;s Irish Army, which had stayed loyal in 1688, and Protestant militia. Fighting culminated in the siege of Derry, where the Jacobites failed to regain control of one of the north&#x27;s key towns. This enabled William to land an expeditionary force, which defeated the main Jacobite army at the Boyne in July 1690. James returned to France after the battle, while the Jacobites were decisively defeated at Aughrim in 1691. The war ended with the Treaty of Limerick in October 1691.

One contemporary witness, George Story, calculated the war cost over 100,000 lives through sickness, famine, and in battle. Subsequent Jacobite risings were confined to Scotland and England, but the war was to have a lasting effect on the political and cultural landscape of Ireland, confirming British and Protestant rule over the country for over two centuries. While the Treaty of Limerick had offered a series of guarantees to Catholics, subsequent extension of the Penal Laws, particularly during the War of the Spanish Succession, would further erode their civic rights.

==Background==
The war began in March 1689 when James II and VII landed in Ireland seeking to reverse the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, which had replaced him with his nephew William III and daughter Mary II. The conflict was part of the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years&#x27; War between Louis XIV of France and the Grand Alliance, a coalition led by William as Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic. Both Louis and William viewed Ireland as a subsidiary theatre, as did James, whose primary objective was to regain England.

Ireland was selected because some 75% of the population shared James&#x27; Catholicism, with Protestants concentrated in Ulster, where they comprised nearly 50% of the population. It also possessed a large Catholic army, built up by the Earl of Tyrconnell since 1687; although the majority were poorly equipped, unpaid recruits, James brought weapons and French regulars with him to provide training. However, the concessions demanded by Irish Catholics in return for their backing undermined Jacobite support in England and Scotland, which were overwhelmingly Protestant. This also applied to Ulster, without which James could not support the rising in Scotland, invade England or prevent William bringing in troops and supplies.

Their major demands included reversal of land confiscations which had reduced Catholic land ownership from 90% in 1600 to 22% by 1685. This was opposed both by Protestants and those members of the Irish Catholic elite who benefitted from previous settlements, among them Tyrconnell and James himself. Another was the autonomy of the Parliament of Ireland, an idea that clashed with Stuart ideology, which was strongly Unionist. These differing external and internal objectives undermined the Jacobite campaign.

==War==
===1688–1689: the North===
Prior to November 1688, James was so confident Ireland would remain loyal that he ordered 2,500 troops, or around 40% of the Irish army, transferred to England. This deprived Tyrconnell of vital trained personnel, while their presence led to near mutiny in several of James&#x27; most reliable English units. Many of the Irish rank and file were arrested after William&#x27;s landing, and later sent to serve under Emperor Leopold in the Austrian–Ottoman War.

Apparently shaken by the speed of James&#x27;s fall, Tyrconnell opened negotiations with William, although this may have been a delaying tactic. His wife, Frances Talbot, was the elder sister of Sarah Churchill, whose husband Marlborough was a key member of the English military conspiracy against James. One of those transferred to England in September was Richard Hamilton, an Irish Catholic professional soldier. Confined in the Tower of London after James&#x27; flight, in January William sent him to negotiate with Tyrconnell: once back in Ireland, however, he was widely thought to have convinced Tyrconnell to abandon negotiations.

In January, Tyrconnell issued warrants for the recruitment of another 40,000 levies, almost entirely Catholic and organised along standard regimental lines. By spring 1689, the army theoretically had around 36,000 men, although experienced officers remained in short supply. Paying, equipping and training this number was impossible and many were organised as Rapparees or irregulars, largely beyond Tyrconnell&#x27;s control. Despite assurances of protection, the easiest way to obtain supplies or money was to confiscate it from Protestants; many fled to the North or England, spreading &quot;predictions of impending catastrophe&quot;.

Fears grew as areas outside the towns became increasingly lawless, exacerbated when Dublin Castle ordered Protestant militia to be disarmed. This caused an exodus from the countryside; the population of Derry grew from 2,500 in December to over 30,000 by April. Doubts over the ability of Tyrconnell&#x27;s regime to ensure law and order was not confined to Protestants; many Catholics also sought security abroad or in large towns.

James landed in Kinsale on 12 March, accompanied by French regulars under Conrad von Rosen, along with English, Scottish and Irish volunteers. The news sparked pro-Williamite demonstrations in Belfast, offset by a more cautious response elsewhere. Arthur Rawdon, who later organised the Army of the North, had offered to fight for James against Monmouth in 1685 and did not commit to William until March 1689. Protestants were concentrated in Ulster and urban centres such as Sligo and Dublin, which Tyrconnell sought to secure with Catholic units of the Irish army. Catholic troops were refused entry to Derry on 7 December, although the Protestant town council simultaneously declared their &quot;duty and loyalty to our sovereign lord, (James)&quot;.

William viewed it as a French proxy invasion, best dealt with by attacking France and agreed to divert resources only because &quot;abandoning&quot; beleaguered Irish Protestants was politically unacceptable in England and Scotland. On 8 March, the English Parliament approved funding for an Irish expeditionary force of 22,230 men, composed of new levies and European mercenaries. In return, Parliament agreed to join the Grand Alliance and become part of the wider Nine Years&#x27; War.

Hamilton had been appointed Jacobite commander in the North, and on 14 March he secured eastern Ulster by routing a Williamite militia at Dromore. On 11 April, Viscount Dundee launched a Jacobite rising in Scotland; on 18th, James joined the siege of Derry and on 29th, the French landed another 1,500–3,000 Jacobites at Bantry Bay. When reinforcements from England reached Derry in mid-April, governor Robert Lundy advised them to return, claiming the city was indefensible. Their commanders, Richards and Cunningham, were later dismissed by William for cowardice and Lundy fled the town in disguise.

The Jacobite focus on western Ulster, specifically Derry and Enniskillen, has been described as a strategic error. The eastern region was of greater significance, since it allowed mutual support between Irish and Scots Jacobites and, if it had been captured, resupply from England would have been made far more difficult. By mid May, the Williamite position had improved; on 16th, government forces retained control of Kintyre, cutting direct links between Scotland and Ireland. The main Jacobite army was stuck outside Derry, its French contingent proving more unpopular with their Irish colleagues than their opponents. On 11 June, four battalions of Williamite reinforcements under the tough and experienced Percy Kirke arrived on the Foyle, north of Derry.

The war in the North turned on three events in the last week of July. Dundee&#x27;s victory at Killiecrankie on 27th was offset by his own death and heavy losses among his troops, ending the Scottish rising as a serious threat. On the 28th, Kirke&#x27;s forces broke the Jacobite blockade with naval support and raised the siege of Derry; the besiegers fired the surrounding countryside and retreated south. On the 31st, a Jacobite attack on Enniskillen was defeated at Newtownbutler; over 1,500 men were killed and its leader Mountcashel captured. From a position of virtual domination, the Jacobites lost their hold on Ulster within a week.

On 13 August, Schomberg landed in Belfast Lough with the main Williamite army; by the end of the month, he had more than 20,000 men. Carrickfergus fell on 27 August; James insisted on holding Dundalk, against the advice of his French advisors who wanted to retreat beyond the Shannon. Tyrconnell was pessimistic about their chances but an opportunity for Schomberg to end the war by taking Dundalk was missed, largely due to a complete failure of logistics.

Ireland was a relatively poor country with a small population, obliging both armies to depend on external support. While this ultimately proved a greater problem for the Jacobites, Schomberg&#x27;s men lacked tents, coal, food and clothing, largely because his inexperienced commissary agent in Chester could not charter enough ships. This was worsened by choosing a campsite on low, marshy ground, which autumn rains and lack of hygiene quickly turned into a stinking swamp. Nearly 6,000 men died from disease before Schomberg ordered a withdrawal into winter quarters in November. Inspecting the abandoned camp, John Stevens, an English Catholic serving with the Grand Prior&#x27;s Regiment, recorded that &quot;a vast number of dead bodies was found there unburied, and not a few yet breathing but almost devoured with lice and other vermin&quot;.

===Jacobite political and strategic objectives 1689–1690===
The Jacobites were undermined by differing political and strategic objectives, reflected in the Irish Parliament that sat from May to July. Since no elections were held in Counties Fermanagh and Donegal, the Commons was 70 members short and largely composed of Catholics; of these, a minority were members of the old Gaelic gentry or &#x27;Old Irish&#x27;, the majority being so-called &#x27;Old English&#x27; of Anglo-Norman descent. Five Protestant peers and four Church of Ireland bishops sat in the Lords, with Anthony Dopping, Bishop of Meath acting as leader of the opposition.

Dubbed the &quot;Patriot Parliament&quot; by 19th century nationalist historian Charles Duffy, in reality it was deeply divided. For James, regaining England was his main objective, and concessions to his Irish supporters potentially weakened his position there. In the early stages of the war, Protestant Jacobite support was more significant than often appreciated and included many members of the established Church of Ireland, the most prominent being Viscount Mountjoy. His opposition to Irish autonomy meant James made concessions with great reluctance and despite his own Catholicism, insisted on the rights of the established church.

While personally loyal to James, Tyrconnell viewed his restoration as secondary to preservation of Catholic rights. One of the few Catholics who benefited from the 1662 Land Settlement, he and other beneficiaries had no desire to make substantial changes to it. Led by the Earl of Limerick, this faction urged a compromise settlement with William in January. They were opposed by the &#x27;Old Irish&#x27;, whose main demand was regaining estates confiscated from them after the 1652 Cromwellian conquest.

As a result, a significant proportion of the Irish Parliament preferred to negotiate, which meant avoiding combat to preserve the army and retain as much territory as possible. James himself viewed war in Ireland as a dead-end, and pointed out that the French provided only enough supplies to keep the conflict going, not win it. As a former naval commander, he argued retaking England meant a cross-Channel invasion, and French suggestions of doing so via the Irish Sea were simply unrealistic. Since the French navy was unable to resupply their own forces in Ireland, it was unlikely they could control the Irish Sea long enough to land troops in the face of a hostile population.

Peripheral rebellions in Ireland and Scotland were a cost-effective way for France to divert British resources from Europe. This meant prolonging the war was more useful than winning it, although potentially devastating for the local populace, a dilemma that resurfaced in the 1745 Scottish Rising. In 1689, the French envoy d&#x27;Avaux urged the Jacobites to withdraw beyond the Shannon, first destroying everything in between, including Dublin. Unsurprisingly, this suggestion was rejected, as the Irish were united in their dislike of the French in general and d&#x27;Avaux in particular. The feeling was mutual; when replaced in April 1690, d&#x27;Avaux told his successor Lauzun the Irish were &#x27;a poor-spirited and cowardly people, whose soldiers never fight and whose officers will never obey orders.&#x27;

===1690: the Boyne and Limerick===

In April 1690, an additional 6,000 French regulars arrived, in exchange for a roughly equivalent number of Irish troops under Mountcashel, who were sent to France. To retain as much territory as possible, the Jacobites held a line along the River Boyne, first destroying or removing crops and livestock to the north. This reduced the local population to utter misery; a French official recorded his horror at seeing people &quot;eating grass like horses&quot;, or their corpses littering the roads. It took over fifty years for the area around Drogheda to recover from this devastation.

Faced by demands from his English government that he resolve the position in Ireland before taking the offensive in Flanders, William committed the majority of his available forces there and took personal command of the campaign. On 14 June 1690, 300 ships arrived in Belfast Lough carrying nearly 31,000 men, a combination of Dutch, English and Danish regiments. Parliament backed him with increased funding and the issues faced by Schomberg were remedied, transportation costs alone rising from £15,000 in 1689 to over £100,000 in 1690.

The Jacobites established defensive positions at Oldbridge, outside Drogheda on the south bank of the Boyne. In the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July, William crossed the river in several places, forcing them to retreat. The result itself was not decisive, with fewer than 2,000 dead on both sides, including Schomberg, but demoralised and weakened by desertion, the Jacobite army retreated to Limerick. This allowed William to enter Dublin unopposed.

Elsewhere, victory at Fleurus on 1 July gave the French control of Flanders; on the same day as the Boyne, they defeated a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet at Beachy Head, causing panic in England. As a former English naval commander, James recognised control of the Channel was a rare opportunity and returned to France to urge an immediate invasion. However, the French failed to follow up their victory and by August, the Anglo-Dutch fleet had regained command of the sea.

Tyrconnell had spent the winter of 1689 to 1690 urging Louis XIV to support a &quot;descent on England&quot; and avoid fighting on Irish soil. His requests were rejected; an invasion required enormous expenditure and Louis trusted neither James nor his English supporters. While there were sound strategic reasons for his hurried departure, which were backed by his senior commanders, James has gone down in Irish history as or &quot;James the beshitten/coward&quot;.

An opportunity to end the war was missed when William overestimated the strength of his position. The Declaration of Finglas of 17 July excluded Jacobite officers and the Catholic landed class from a general pardon, encouraging them to continue fighting. Shortly afterwards, James Douglas and 7,500 men tried to break the Jacobite defensive line along the Shannon by taking Athlone. However they lacked sufficient siege artillery and provisions and rumors had reached Douglas that Patrick Sarsfield was marching with 15,000 men to cut off their forces from retreat. Douglas decided to withdraw in the middle of the night and by alternate route to avoid meeting the Irish force.

Limerick, strategic key to the west of Ireland, became William&#x27;s next objective, the Jacobites concentrating the bulk of their forces in the city. A detachment under Marlborough captured Cork and Kinsale but Limerick repulsed a series of assaults, inflicting heavy casualties. Cavalry raids led by Patrick Sarsfield destroyed William&#x27;s artillery train and heavy rain prevented replacements. Faced by multiple threats in mainland Europe, William withdrew and left Ireland in late 1690, the Jacobites retaining large parts of western Ireland.

Dutch general de Ginkell assumed command, based at Kilkenny, with Douglas in Ulster and the Danes under Württemberg at Waterford. Protestant administration was re-established in the counties held by Williamites, with arrests and confiscation of Jacobite estates, intended to reward William&#x27;s supporters. Ginkel pointed out doing so in cash, not land, was cheaper than a month of war and urged more generous terms.

On 24 July, a letter from James confirmed ships were on their way to evacuate the French brigade and any others who wanted to leave; he also released his Irish officers from their oaths, allowing them to seek a negotiated end to the war. Tyrconnell and the French troops sailed from Galway in early September; James&#x27;s inexperienced illegitimate son James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick was left in command, supported by a council of officers composed of Thomas Maxwell, Dominic Sheldon, John Hamilton and Sarsfield.

Tyrconnell hoped to obtain sufficient French support to extend the conflict and gain better terms, which he told Louis could be done with limited numbers of French troops. A negotiated peace also required him to reduce the influence of the pro-war party, led by Sarsfield, who was increasingly popular with the army. He told James the pro-war group wanted Irish autonomy or even independence, while he wished to see Ireland linked firmly to England; to do so, he needed arms, money and an &#x27;experienced&#x27; French general to replace Sarsfield and Berwick.

===1691: Athlone, Aughrim and the second siege of Limerick===

By late 1690, divisions between the Jacobite &quot;Peace Party&quot; and &quot;War Party&quot; had widened. Those who supported Tyrconnell&#x27;s efforts to negotiate with William included senior officers Thomas Maxwell and John Hamilton, in addition to political figures such as Lord Riverston and Denis Daly. Sarsfield&#x27;s &quot;War Party&quot; argued William could still be defeated; while once characterised as representing the &#x27;Old Irish&#x27; interest, its leaders included the English officer Dorrington and &#x27;Old English&#x27; Purcell and Luttrell.

Encouraged by William&#x27;s failure to take Limerick and looking to reduce Tyrconnell&#x27;s influence, Sarsfield&#x27;s faction appealed directly to Louis XIV requesting that Tyrconnell and Berwick were removed from office. They also asked for substantial French military aid, although this was unlikely as the French regime saw Flanders, the Rhine, and Italy as greater strategic priorities. Ginkell had finally obtained William&#x27;s permission to offer the Jacobites moderate terms of surrender, including a guarantee of religious toleration, but when in December the &quot;Peace Party&quot; made moves to accept, Sarsfield demanded that Berwick have Hamilton, Riverston and Daly arrested. Berwick complied, although likely with the tacit approval of Tyrconnell, who returned from France to try to regain control by offering Sarsfield concessions.

Deeply alarmed by the rift between his Irish supporters, James was persuaded to request further military support directly from Louis. Louis dispatched general Charles Chalmot, Marquis de Saint-Ruhe, to replace Berwick as commander of the Irish Army, with secret instructions to assess the situation and help Louis make a decision on whether to send additional military aid. Saint-Ruhe, accompanied by lieutenant-generals de Tessé and d&#x27;Usson, arrived at Limerick on 9 May; they brought sufficient arms, corn and meal to sustain the army until the autumn, but no troops or money.

By late spring, concerned that a French convoy could land further reinforcements at Galway or Limerick, Ginkell began making preparations to enter the field as quickly as possible. During May, both sides began assembling their forces for a summer campaign, the Jacobites at Limerick and the Williamites at Mullingar, while low-level skirmishing continued.

On 16 June, Ginkell&#x27;s cavalry began reconnoitring from Ballymore towards Athlone. Saint-Ruhe had initially strung out his forces behind the line of the Shannon, but by 19 June he realised Athlone was the target and began concentrating his troops west of the town. Ginkell breached the Jacobite lines of defence and took Athlone on 30 June after a short but bloody siege, taking Maxwell prisoner; Saint-Ruhe failed in his attempts to relieve the garrison and fell back to the west.

Athlone was seen as a significant victory for William&#x27;s forces, as it was believed that Saint-Ruhe&#x27;s army would probably collapse if the Shannon was crossed. The Lords Justice in Dublin issued a proclamation offering generous terms for Jacobites who surrendered, including a free pardon, restoration of forfeited estates, and the offer of similar or higher rank and pay if they wished to join William&#x27;s army. The Jacobite command fell apart in mutual recriminations: Sarsfield&#x27;s faction accused Maxwell, a follower of Tyrconnell, of treachery, while Saint-Ruhe&#x27;s subordinate d&#x27;Usson sided with Tyrconnell, who appointed him governor of Galway.

Unaware of the location of Saint-Ruhe&#x27;s main army and assuming he was outnumbered, on 10 July Ginkell continued a cautious advance through Ballinasloe down the main Limerick and Galway road. Saint-Ruhe&#x27;s initial plan, endorsed by Tyrconnell, had been to fall back on Limerick and force the Williamites into another year of campaigning, but wishing to redeem his errors at Athlone he appears to have instead decided to force a decisive battle. Ginkell, with 20,000 men, found his way blocked by Saint-Ruhe&#x27;s similarly sized army at Aughrim on the early morning of 12 July. Despite a brave and tenacious defence by the inexperienced Irish infantry, the Battle of Aughrim would see Saint-Ruhe dead, many senior Jacobite officers captured or killed, and the Jacobite army shattered.

D&#x27;Usson succeeded as overall commander: he surrendered Galway on 21 July, on advantageous terms. Following Aughrim the remnants of Saint-Ruhe&#x27;s army retreated to the mountains before regrouping under Sarsfield&#x27;s command at Limerick, where the defences were still in the process of being repaired: many of the Jacobite infantry regiments were seriously depleted, although some stragglers arrived later. Tyrconnell, who had been sick for some time, died at Limerick shortly afterwards, depriving the Jacobites of their main negotiator. Sarsfield and the Jacobites&#x27; main army surrendered at Limerick in October after a short siege.

===Treaty of Limerick===
Now the senior Jacobite commander, Sarsfield signed the Treaty of Limerick with Ginkel on 3 October 1691. It promised freedom of worship for Catholics, and legal protection for any Jacobites willing to swear an oath of loyalty to William and Mary, although the estates of those killed prior to the treaty were still liable to forfeiture. It also agreed to Sarsfield&#x27;s demand that those still serving in the Jacobite army could leave for France. Popularly known as the &quot;Flight of the Wild Geese&quot;, the process began almost immediately and was completed by December.

Modern estimates suggest that around 19,000 soldiers and rapparees departed: women and children brought the figure to slightly over 20,000, or about one per cent of Ireland&#x27;s population. Some of the soldiers allegedly had to be forced on board the ships when they learned they would be joining the French army. Most were unable to bring or contact their families, and many appear to have deserted en route from Limerick to Cork, the point of departure.

==Aftermath==

The &quot;Wild Geese&quot; were initially formed into James II&#x27;s army in exile. After James&#x27;s death, they were merged into France&#x27;s Irish Brigade, which had been set up in 1689 using the 6,000 troops accompanying Mountcashel. Disbanded Jacobites still presented a considerable risk to security in Ireland and despite resistance from the English and Irish parliaments, William continued to encourage them to join his own army; by the end of 1693 a further 3,650 former Jacobites had joined William&#x27;s forces fighting on the Continent. The Lord Lieutenant Viscount Sidney eventually restricted enlistment to &quot;known Protestants&quot;, upon which the last remnants of the Jacobite army still in Ireland were sent home with a financial inducement to keep the peace.

In the interim the English legislature, possibly acting under pressure from Irish Protestant refugees in London, passed a 1691 Act &quot;for the Abrogating the Oath of Supremacy in Ireland and Appointing other Oaths&quot;. This required anyone taking the Oath of Supremacy, such as when practising law, as a physician, or when taking a seat in the Irish Parliament, to deny transubstantiation; it effectively barred all Catholics, although included a clause exempting beneficiaries of the articles of Limerick in some circumstances. Despite this, many Protestants were initially outraged by their perception that the treaty had left the Jacobites &quot;immune to the penalties of defeat&quot;. The fact that the administration chose to forbid searches for Jacobite arms and horses in order to prevent the settling of private scores was taken as evidence of pro-Catholic bias, and it was even rumoured that the Lord Chancellor Sir Charles Porter was a &quot;secret Jacobite&quot;.

Continuing fears over Catholics&#x27; potential support of a French invasion and the appointment in 1695 of Capell as Lord Deputy saw a change of attitude. The same year, the Irish Parliament passed the Disarming Act, forbidding Catholics other than the Limerick and Galway &#x27;articlemen&#x27; to own a weapon or a horse worth more than £5. A second 1695 bill, designed to deter Irish Catholics &quot;from their foreign correspondency and dependency&quot; and aimed particularly at the country&#x27;s &quot;English ancient families&quot;, restrained Catholics from educating their children abroad. Catholic gentry saw such actions as a serious breach of faith, summed up by the phrase (&quot;remember Limerick and Saxon perfidy&quot;) supposedly used in later years by the exiles of the Irish Brigade. However, despite later extension of the penal laws, the &#x27;articlemen&#x27; of Limerick, Galway, Drogheda and other garrisons subject to Williamite articles of surrender generally stayed exempt for the remainder of their lives.

===Long-term effects===

The Williamite victory in the war in Ireland had two main long-term results. The first was that it ensured James II would not regain his thrones in England, Ireland and Scotland by military means. The second was that it ensured closer British and Protestant dominance over Ireland. Until the nineteenth century, Ireland was ruled by what became known as the &quot;Protestant Ascendancy&quot;, the mostly Protestant ruling class. The majority Irish Catholic community and the Ulster-Scots Presbyterian community were systematically excluded from power, which was based on land ownership.

For over a century after the war, Irish Catholics maintained a sentimental attachment to the Jacobite cause, portraying James and the Stuarts as the rightful monarchs who would have given a just settlement to Ireland, including self-government, restoration of confiscated lands and tolerance for Catholicism. Thousands of Irish soldiers left the country to serve the Stuart monarchs in the Spanish and French armies. Until 1766, France and the Papacy remained committed to restoring the Stuarts to their British Kingdoms. At least one composite Irish battalion (500 men) drawn from Irish soldiers in the French service, fought on the Jacobite side in the Scottish Jacobite uprisings up to the Battle of Culloden in 1746.

The war also began the penetration of the Irish Protestant gentry into the British army&#x27;s officer corps; by the 1770s, Irish Protestants made up about one third of the officer corps as a whole, a number hugely disproportionate to their population.

Protestants portrayed the Williamite victory as a triumph for religious and civil liberty. Triumphant murals of King William still controversially adorn gable walls in Ulster, and the defeat of the Catholics in the Williamite war is still commemorated by Protestant Unionists, by the Orange Order on the Twelfth of July.

<text>Earthquake Weather is the first non-soundtrack solo album by former frontman of The Clash, Joe Strummer, released on 20 September 1989. The album was well received by critics, but was not a commercial success. The majority of the album was recorded in Los Angeles, California in 1988 and 1989, as evident from the cover photography and design by Josh Cheuse.

It was the first time Strummer had worked on his own musical project. In previous years he had worked with Alex Cox on the soundtracks of his films &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and &quot;Walker&quot; in 1986 and 1987. He also worked on the production of his former Clash partner Mick Jones&#x27; second album with the band Big Audio Dynamite in 1986.
It was the reception and sales of the music score from the film &quot;Walker&quot; that got Strummer into the right mental state to start working on his own material again. He got a group together which consisted of Zander Schloss, Lonnie Marshall, Jack Irons and Willie MacNeil. The backing band became known as The Latino Rockabilly War. The first project the band worked on was for the film &quot;Permanent Record&quot; with Keanu Reeves which featured the songs &quot;Trash City&quot;, &quot;Baby the Trans&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; &#x27;bout Nothin&quot;, &quot;Nefertiti Rock&quot;, and the haunting instrumental &quot;Theme from Permanent Record&quot;.

In 2008 the album was re-released although it was not remastered and the version was very bare bones featuring no liner notes and basically a CD-R version of the album.

<doc id="1103513" wikidata="Q391923" url="?curid=1103513" title="Tupolev Tu-14">
<text>The Tupolev Tu-14 (NATO reporting name: Bosun) (USAF/DOD reporting name: Type 35), was a Soviet twinjet light bomber derived from the Tupolev &#x27;73&#x27;, the failed competitor to the Ilyushin Il-28 &#x27;Beagle&#x27;. It was used as a torpedo bomber by the mine-torpedo regiments of Soviet Naval Aviation between 1952–1959 and exported to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Development==
The Tu-14 had its origin in the three-engined &#x27;73&#x27; design which used a pair of Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets under the wings and a single Rolls-Royce Derwent V in the tail, in an installation much like that of the central engine of a Boeing 727. The availability of the Klimov VK-1, a more-powerful version of the Nene, allowed the RD-500, Soviet version of Derwent, to be deleted from the preliminary design, which was given the internal designation of &quot;81&quot;. The other major change was the addition of a PSBN navigation radar which required a fifth crewmember to operate. This was rejected by the VVS and Tupolev reworked the design to eliminate the dorsal and ventral turrets and reduce the crew to only three, the pilot, a bombardier-navigator, and a tail gunner. It retained the two fixed Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannon in the fuselage nose, but the design of the fuselage was changed to give the gunner his own separate pressurized compartment and a KDU-81 tail turret armed with another pair of NR-23 guns.

Construction of the prototype began in August 1949, using components from the canceled Tu-73S prototypes, and was completed in October. The manufacturer&#x27;s tests were conducted between 13 October 1949 and 21 January 1950. Its State acceptance trials lasted from 23 January to 27 May 1950 and it was accepted for production, provided that the problems with the KDU-81 turret were resolved and that ejection seats were provided for the pilot and gunner, a hot air deicing was to be fitted and the gun mount in the nose revised. The first five preproduction aircraft did not incorporate these changes as they were built using Tu-73S components, after the factory in Irkutsk had prematurely begun production of that bomber. One of these was sent to Moscow where it was evaluated by Soviet Naval Aviation for use as a torpedo bomber. The sixth aircraft did incorporate all these changes as well as the navigator&#x27;s ejection seat requested by Naval Aviation, and it was evaluated in May 1951. It was recommended for production as the Tu-14T and entered service in 1952 with Naval Aviation.
About 150 were produced and served with the mine-torpedo regiments of Naval Aviation until 1959. It was given the NATO reporting name Bosun. After it was withdrawn from service, several were used for various test programs, including one evaluating ramjet engines. Up to 50 used Tu-14Ts were delivered to the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force although quantities and dates cannot be confirmed.

The second preproduction Tu-14 was converted into a day or night photographic reconnaissance aircraft with the OKB designation of &quot;89&quot;. The conversion was fairly minor and involved an unpressurized central cabin that housed two automatic pivoting cameras, two fuel tanks and another camera fitted in the bomb bay and another camera for oblique photography was mounted in the aircraft&#x27;s tail for the daylight photography role. All cameras and their viewports were electrically heated to prevent misting and icing at altitude. For night photography, the fuel tanks and camera in the bomb bay were removed and a variety of flash bombs were carried to illuminate the targets. In addition, the screen of the PSBN-M navigation radar could be photographed by a special camera and both the pilot and navigator could record their own observations using a voice recorder. However, the VVS had already decided to use the Il-28R reconnaissance version of the standard Il-28 by the time that the &quot;89&quot; first flew on 23 March 1951 and Tupolev decided not to submit it for State acceptance trials.

==Variants==
*Tu-14 – Light bomber version (not accepted for service).
*Tu-14R – Reconnaissance version (prototype only). Also known as Tu-89.
*Tu-14T – Torpedo bomber version.
*&#x27;81&#x27; - OKB designation of the Tu-14 2 × VK-1 prototype
*&#x27;93&#x27; – OKB designation of the proposed derivative of the Tu-14T with VK-5 or VK-7 engines; not built.

==Operators==
*Soviet Naval Aviation
*People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force

<text>Acrophony (; + &#x27;sound&#x27;) is the naming of letters of an alphabetic writing system so that a letter&#x27;s name begins with the letter itself. For example, Greek letter names are acrophonic: the names of the letters α, β, γ, δ, are spelled with the respective letters: (), (), (), ().

The paradigm for acrophonic alphabets is the Proto-Sinaitic script and the succeeding Phoenician alphabet, in which the letter A, representing the sound , is thought to have derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph representing an ox, and is called &#x27;ox&#x27;, , which starts with the glottal stop sound the letter represents. The second letter of the Phoenician alphabet is &quot;bet&quot; (which means &#x27;house&#x27; and looks a bit like a shelter) representing the sound [b], and from &quot;ālep-bēt&quot; came the word &quot;alphabet&quot;another case where the beginning of a thing gives the name to the whole, which was in fact common practice in the ancient Near East.

The Glagolitic and early Cyrillic alphabets, although not consisting of ideograms, also have letters named acrophonically. The letters representing /a, b, v, g, d, e/ are named , , , , , . Naming the letters in order, one recites a poem, a mnemonic which helps students and scholars learn the alphabet: means &#x27;I know letters, [the] word is good&#x27; in Old Church Slavonic.

In Irish and Ogham, letters were formerly named after trees, for example A was (&#x27;white fir&#x27;), B was (&#x27;birch&#x27;) and C was (&#x27;hazel&#x27;). The rune alphabets used by the Germanic peoples were also named acrophonically; for example, the first three letters, which represented the sounds /f, u, θ/, were named , , in Norse (&#x27;wealth&#x27;, &#x27;slag/rain&#x27;, &#x27;giant&#x27;) and , , in Old English (&#x27;wealth&#x27;, &#x27;ox&#x27;, &#x27;thorn&#x27;). Both sets of names probably stemmed from Proto-Germanic , , .

The Thai alphabet is learned acrophonically, each letter being represented pictorially in school-books ( &#x27;chicken&#x27;; &#x27;egg&#x27;, &#x27;buffalo&#x27;; &#x27;bell&#x27;; &#x27;snake&#x27;, etc.).

Rudyard Kipling gives a fictional description of the process in one of his &quot;Just So Stories&quot;, &quot;How the Alphabet was Made&quot;.

Modern radiotelephony and aviation uses spelling alphabets (the best-known of which is the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, which begins with &quot;Alfa&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;...) in which the letters of the English alphabet are arbitrarily assigned words and names in an acrophonic manner to avoid misunderstanding.

Most notes of the solfege scalenamely &quot;re&quot;, &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;fa&quot;, &quot;sol&quot;, and &quot;la&quot;derive their names from the first syllable of the lines of , a Latin hymn.

<doc id="1103525" wikidata="Q6929016" url="?curid=1103525" title="Mr. Music Head">
<text>Mr. Music Head is the fourth solo album by Adrian Belew, released in April 1989, and his first for Atlantic Records. It features the single &quot;Oh Daddy&quot;.

==Background==

The album was recorded following the unwilling split of Belew&#x27;s mid-1980s band the Bears, which dissolved due to a lack of record company support (following which Belew managed to secure a solo deal). Belew recorded the majority of the album by himself, making use of his own multi-instrumental skills and his ability to create assorted sonic and instrumental impressions via processed guitar sound. The album also features prominent use of piano, an instrument on which Belew was not particularly confident but which he included on several songs that he believed required it.

The album features Belew&#x27;s second duet with his daughter Audie, with whom he had previously recorded the piano-and-guitar duet &quot;The Final Rhino&quot; on his &quot;Lone Rhino&quot; album in late 1981, when Audie was four. This time, Belew wrote &quot;Oh Daddy&quot;, a humorous father-and-daughter pop duet for Audie (now 11) and him to sing, with lyrics poking gentle fun at Belew&#x27;s own pop ambitions and career to date. Its video features Belew playing the rubber-necked guitar prop which he&#x27;d previously employed for the &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; project with Laurie Anderson.

<doc id="1103527" wikidata="Q1072703" url="?curid=1103527" title="Hexham (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Hexham is a constituency in Northumberland represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2024 by Joe Morris of the Labour Party. As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election at least every five years.

The seat was created as one of four single member divisions of the county of Northumberland under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

==Constituency profile==
The second-largest constituency by land area in England (covering 250,992 hectares under the 2010–2024 boundaries), Hexham reaches to the Pennines and is traversed by Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which runs almost due east–west through England. It includes substantial agricultural holdings, forestry, wood processing, food, minerals, and manufactured hardware industries. In the midst of the northwest of the constituency is Kielder Water; running between this area and the middle of the seat is the southern portion of Kielder Forest, and in the west, the attractions of the precipitous Haltwhistle Burn, Viaduct and Castle. SSE of Hexham is the Derwent Reservoir. As well as those rural areas, the constituency also includes part of Newcastle&#x27;s middle-class suburbs. 

Despite the generally middle-class composition of the population, there are also some more working-class areas: Prudhoe frequently elects Labour councillors and has demographics similar to neighbouring parts of Blaydon, a strongly Labour town in the Blaydon and Consett constituency. There is also some deprivation in rural areas, particularly around Haltwhistle. Based on the latest published old age dependency ratios, a slightly larger than average level of the population is retired. 

An estimate by the House of Commons Library puts the Leave vote by the constituency in the 2016 referendum at 45%.

== History ==
Hexham was considered a safe seat for the Conservative Party, having been under their control for almost a century, with generally safe majorities, from 1924 until it was gained by Labour in 2024. It was the only Conservative seat in the North East between the New Labour years in government from 1997–2010, and the only one in Northumberland from 1973 until the Conservatives gained Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Liberal Democrats in 2015. It was also the northernmost seat won by the Conservatives in 1997, in what would be their worst landslide defeat at any general election of the twentieth century; with all Conservative MPs in Scotland and Wales unseated that year. In 1997, the Labour Party was very close to winning the seat, but the Conservatives retained it with a significantly reduced narrow majority of 222 votes. 

In 2024, Labour won the seat for the first time on a swing of 14.9% and a majority of 7.2%, despite the fact that it was one of the few seats where Reform UK did not stand.

==Boundaries==
1885–1918: The Sessional Divisions of Bellingham, Coquetdale West, Haltwhistle, and Tynedale.

The contents of the county division were defined by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

1918–1950: The Rural Districts of Bellingham, Haltwhistle, Hexham, and the part of the Rural District of Castle Ward which consists of the civil parishes of Bitchfield, Black Heddon, Capheaton, Cheeseburn Grange, East Matfen, Fenwick, Harlow Hill, Hawkwell, Heugh, Ingoe, Kearsley, Kirkheaton, Nesbitt, Ouston, Ryal, Wallridge and West Matfen, and the Urban Districts of Hexham and Prudhoe.

Rothbury was transferred to Berwick-upon-Tweed.

1950–1974: The Urban Districts of Hexham and Prudhoe, and the Rural Districts of Bellingham, Castle Ward, Haltwhistle, Hexham.

The remainder of Castle Ward was transferred from the abolished constituency of Wansbeck.

1974–1983: The urban districts of Hexham and Prudhoe, and the rural districts of Bellingham, Castle Ward, Haltwhistle, and Hexham.

The boundary with Blyth was slightly amended to take account of changes to local government boundaries.

1983–2010: The District of Tynedale, and the following wards of the Borough of Castle Morpeth: Heddon-on-the-Wall, Ponteland East, Ponteland North, Ponteland South, Ponteland West, Stamfordham, Stannington, and Whalton.

Contents changed following reorganisation of local authorities in 1974. The area of the former rural district of Castle Ward which was now part of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear was now included in Newcastle upon Tyne North.
2010–2024: The District of Tynedale, and the following wards of the Borough of Castle Morpeth: Heddon-on-the-Wall, Ponteland East, Ponteland North, Ponteland South, Ponteland West, Stamfordham, and Stannington.

In the fifth periodic boundary review of parliamentary representation in Northumberland, which came into effect for the 2010 general election, the contents of the existing Hexham constituency were unchanged except for losing the southern part of the Hartburn ward to Berwick-upon-Tweed, and the Boundary Commission for England made only minor changes in Northumberland to take account of ward boundary changes.

In 2009, a further government reorganisation resulted in the abolition of all local government boroughs and districts in Northumberland and the establishment of the county as a unitary authority. However, this did not affect the constituency boundaries.

2024–present: The City of Newcastle upon Tyne ward of Callerton &amp; Throckley, and the County of Northumberland electoral divisions of Bellingham, Bywell, Corbridge, Haltwhistle, Haydon and Hadrian, Hexham Central with Acomb, Hexham East, Hexham West, Humshaugh, Longhorsley, Ponteland East and Stannington, Ponteland North, Ponteland South with Heddon, Ponteland West, Prudhoe North, Prudhoe South, South Tynedale, and Stocksfield and Broomhaugh.
:&quot;Expanded to bring the electorate within the permitted range by adding the Newcastle ward of Callerton &amp; Throckley. The boundaries within Northumberland were adjusted slightly to take account of the reorganisation of local authority electoral divisions.&quot;

== Members of Parliament ==
Colonel Douglas Clifton Brown, who was Speaker of the House of Commons during the latter years of the World War II, represented the seat for two separate tenures (from 1918–23, and again from 1924–51).

<text>The Hokonui Hills, also known as &quot;The Hokonui Mountains&quot; or simply &quot;The Hokonui&quot;, are a range of hills in central Southland, New Zealand. They rise to 600 metres above the surrounding Southland Plains, of which the hills mark a northern extremity.

The Hokonui forms part of the Southland Syncline, a geological fold system which extends northwestward from the coast at The Catlins. Owing to the transform fault which forms the Southern Alps, the westernmost part of the syncline has been transported several hundred kilometres to the north; this western section includes many of the hills within the Kahurangi National Park in the northwest of the South Island.

The Hokonui Hills also splits the Southland Plains in two - to the north and east lies the broad floodplain of the Mataura River, and to the south and west lie the plains of the Aparima and Ōreti Rivers. The Ōreti&#x27;s major tributary, the Makarewa River, rises in the south of the Hokonui Hills.

The hills lie within a triangle formed by the towns of Gore to the east, Lumsden to the north, and Winton to the southwest, and cover approximately 1,200 km².

During the nineteenth century, the region gained a reputation for the production of illicit alcohol known as &quot;Hokonui moonshine&quot;. The association between the region and illicit alcohol lasted until the 1930s and has passed into New Zealand folklore. The Hokonui Moonshiner Museum in Gore celebrates the &quot;colourful history of illicit whiskey making and consumption&quot;.

<text>The GP Wolber was a French cycling event in the 1920s. It was considered a kind of unofficial World Championship. Only cyclists who finished in the top-3 of the major French, Italian, Belgian and Swiss races were invited. The first GP Wolber was held in 1922. When the World Cycling Championship was introduced in 1927 the race started to lose prestige. The race ran until at least 1939.

<text>The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (also known as the Meatworkers Union) is an Australian trade union representing workers in the meat industry including in abattoirs, butchers, and smallgoods manufacturers.

== Structure ==
The AMIEU has branches representing workers each State and Territory of Australia. Branch officials are democratically elected by the members every four years.

The union also has a Federal Council, which represents the union nationally and is the supreme decision making body of the union. The Council is composed of elected delegates from each branch, who meet every two years to determine policy for the union and elect the Federal Secretary and President.

In between the biannual meetings of the Council the union is governed by a Federal Executive made up of the secretaries of each branch as well as the Federal Secretary and President.

The union is affiliated with the IUF, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the Australian Labor Party.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Prior to 1890 there were no organised trade unions in the Australian meat processing industry. Wages and conditions varied from worksite to worksite and were re-negotiated at the start of each killing season by butchers on behalf of their teams. Wages tended to be higher at the start of the season when cattle were plentiful, but then driven down significantly at the end of the season when cattle were scarce.

The AMIEU was formed in 1906 as the Federated Butchers Union, and changed its name to the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union in 1912.

The AMIEU was organised between 1906 and 1920, particularly in Queensland, by the revolutionary union the Industrial Workers of the World. The IWW, or Wobblies, encouraged Meatworkers to set up boards of control on job sites. These boards functioned, effectively, as works councils in the Meat industry. The boards were particularly strong in North Queensland where, under the direction of state organiser Walter Russell Crampton, they controlled production levels through direct action. Meat industry sheds in North Queensland were so effectively organised that the sheds became closed shops. This was known in the day as Preference of Employment.

The AMEIU used the skilled portion of the workforce, the slaughtering gang, to infiltrate non-union towns in North Queensland. These towns were essentially company towns. The slaughtering gang was irreplaceable due to their skill, they were mobile as their skill was in demand across multiple shops, and they were militant. The AMIEU considered itself an industrial union and enrolled all workers in a particular workplace regardless of their trade—the meatworkers represented boilermakers, engine drivers and maintenance workers who worked in the meat industry.

The Queensland organising techniques spread to southern states. Shop committees (workers councils) were established at the Melbourne and Corio works in Victoria in 1917, on the initiative of C. Coupe. Coupe believed shop committees would, &quot;ultimately form part of the machinery of government for the workers when they are prepared to take control of the industries, to be run in the interests of the working class.&quot;

In South Australia councils were also established, and in 1919 the South Australian branch of the AMIEU reported to the federal council, &quot;No dispute along the old lines of a cessation of work has taken place within the past two years. Job control and scientific organisation has rendered obsolete this medieval method of fighting. The arbitration method of securing our rights has often been discussed, and has been submitted to most adverse criticism; and, so far as this branch is concerned, unless the whole aim and present methods of the arbitration system are speedily altered, we will have none of it.&quot;

The councils actively organised go-slows and sabotage, as replacements for strike action. Revolutionary unionism is unusual in Australian history, and the 1908–1923 period was particularly militant. In the same period the AMIEU was organising workers councils; the IWW was organising general strikes, forgery scandals and arson attacks in New South Wales to prevent continued Australian involvement in the First World War, and to protect workers rights. The IWW was a large force behind these upheavals in NSW, and when the IWW was persecuted nationally after 1916, the AMIEU supported them.

===Recent history===
IN 1983, the AMIEU was involved in a major industrial dispute at the Mudginberri abattoir in the Northern Territory. The AMIEU served a log of claims on Mudginberri and on all other abattoirs in the Northern Territory, seeking a unit tally system to be set up. Mudginberri chose to fight the claim, with the backing of the National Farmers&#x27; Federation.

The AMIEU has supported a ban on live animal exports since the 2018 animal rights controversy in the Australian live exports industry, and has called for live exports to be replaced by an expanded chilled meat trade.

<text>The Hoosac Tunnel (also called Hoosic or Hoosick Tunnel) is a active railroad tunnel in western Massachusetts that passes through the Hoosac Range, an extension of Vermont&#x27;s Green Mountains. It runs in a straight line from its east portal, along the Deerfield River in the town of Florida, to its west portal, in the city of North Adams.

Work began in 1851 under an estimated cost of $2 million and ended in 1875, having used $21 million. At its completion, the tunnel was the world&#x27;s second-longest, after the Mont Cenis Tunnel through the French Alps. It was the longest tunnel in North America until the 1916 completion of the Connaught Tunnel under Rogers Pass in British Columbia. It remains the longest active transportation tunnel east of the Rocky Mountains, and is the sixth-longest railroad tunnel in North America. The American Society of Civil Engineers made the tunnel an Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1975.

&quot;Hoosac&quot; is an Algonquian word meaning &quot;place of stones&quot;.

==Construction==

===Proposal and beginning===

The tunnel project was originally proposed in 1819 as a canal to connect Boston to Upstate New York via the Deerfield River on the east of the Hoosac Range and the Hoosic River on the west. That project was shelved, and later reborn as part of the new Troy and Greenfield Railroad. The project was nicknamed &quot;The Great Bore&quot; by its critics, including future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who said that he would like to &quot;wall up a dozen lawyers at one end of the tunnel and put a good fee at the other.&quot;

The most important proponent of the northern route and the Hoosac Tunnel was Alvah Crocker, a self-made paper mill owner from Fitchburg, Massachusetts. The project, which was promoted by Crocker but mostly organized and engineered by others, notably Hermann Haupt in the early stages, and several other firms under contract, under the direction of several head engineers assigned by the state of Massachusetts, which took over the project after it initially failed and went bankrupt. In 1841, Crocker formed the Fitchburg Railroad (chartered 1842, opened 1845) between Boston and Fitchburg.

In 1844, Crocker incorporated the existing Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad, which ran from Fitchburg west to Greenfield, as well as northward (from Millers Falls) to Brattleboro, Vermont. In 1848, Crocker secured from the legislature a charter for the Troy &amp; Greenfield Railroad (T &amp; G), with provisions for a tunnel through Hoosac Mountain.

The first chief engineer of the tunnel project was A.F. Edwards. In 1854, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provided $2,000,000 in credit to Edward Wellman Serrell and Company, which began work in 1855. In 1856, Herman Haupt took over as chief engineer.

The Western Railroad, led by Chester W. Chapin, which ran a southern route through Springfield and Pittsfield, opposed the Hoosac Tunnel and its northern route through the state. It successfully lobbied to block state funding of the tunnel in 1861, which bankrupted Haupt and temporarily stopped the project. Haupt had excavated , or about a fifth of the distance, at that point. He left and became a Union Army railroad engineer and general in the American Civil War.

===Completion===

In 1862, the Troy and Greenfield Railroad defaulted on its loan from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which foreclosed on the mortgage and took control of the railroad, including the tunnel project. The state sent engineer Charles Storrow to Europe to study modern tunneling techniques, including the use of nitroglycerin and compressed air. In 1863 the state, with Alvah Crocker now superintendent of railroads, restarted the project and made Thomas Doane the chief engineer.

In 1868, the Massachusetts state legislature appropriated $5 million to complete the project. Canadian engineer Walter Shanly (sometimes spelled Shanley) and his brother Francis took over the project from the state and remained through the completion of the tunnel boring. Among the consulting engineers at the time was Benjamin Henry Latrobe II, a noted civil engineer who was serving as the chief engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

The final chief engineer was Bernard N. Farren, who took over on November 19, 1874, and on Thanksgiving Day that year, the last of rock was removed beneath the town of North Adams. Farren completed the work, including enlarging sections of the tunnel, reinforcing weak areas with arching, completing drainage systems and completing the east tunnel facade. The first train passed through the tunnel on February 9, 1875.

===Technology===
The tunnel construction project required excavation of of rock. On March 16, 1853, &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Patented Stone-Cutting Machine&quot; (a tunnel boring machine) was used; it failed after excavating of rock. Tunnel builders resorted to hand digging, and later used the Burleigh Drilling-machine, one of the first pneumatic drills. Construction also featured the first large-scale commercial use of nitroglycerin and electric blasting caps and the first such use in the United States.

Digging the Central Shaft also allowed workers to open two additional faces to excavate: once the shaft was completed in 1870, workers dug outwards from the center to meet the tunnels being dug from the east and west portals. Engineers built a elevator to hoist the excavated rock from the Central Shaft.

One of the many engineering challenges posed by the project was getting the proper alignment between the four tunnel segments that were being dug: the east and west portal tunnels and the two tunnels dug outward from the central shaft. Engineers cleared a path through the forest over the mountain and strung a straight line from the east to west portals through &quot;sighting posts&quot; on the east and west peaks of Hoosac Mountain. In 1866, Thomas Doane took over as chief engineer. He resurveyed the alignment of the tunnel by constructing six towers. 
The alignment towers served to make sure the tunnel stayed true to its course. Grooved iron markers were originally used instead of these towers. Each tower, except the Rowe Neck tower, consisted of a transit scope, a sloped wooden roof on the top of the stone structure. Repeated surveys verified the line ran true between the posts, and steel bolts were installed at fixed intervals along the line. Only four of the towers remain today, in ruins, and can be found by using old roads and some bushwhacking through the current forest overgrowth.

On December 12, 1872, workers opened the east portal tunnel to the Central Shaft-dug tunnel, which were aligned within : a tremendous engineering achievement at that time. On November 27, 1873, the remainder of the tunnel was opened to the west portal tunnel.

The Hoosac Tunnel allowed the summit of the Fitchburg&#x27;s route to be lower than the Boston and Albany, which only had one short tunnel. Lewis Cuyler of the Hoosac Tunnel Museum Society described the project as the &quot;fountainhead of modern tunnel technology&quot;. The American Society of Civil Engineers made the tunnel an Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1975.

=== and working conditions===
Deadly accidents during construction killed or seriously injured 195 workers with 135 verified deaths. Survivors dubbed the Tunnel the &quot;Bloody Pit&quot;. Workers died from explosions, falling rock, and accidents involving ladders or scaffolding. In 1865, workers went on strike and burned buildings in protest. Fourteen men died or were injured working on the tunnel in 1866.

The deadliest accident was the explosion in the Central Shaft on October 17, 1867. Workers were digging the tunnel&#x27;s vertical exhaust shaft when a candle in the hoist building ignited naphtha fumes that had leaked from a &quot;Gasometer&quot; lamp. The ensuing explosion set the hoist on fire, and it collapsed into the shaft. Four men near the top of the shaft escaped, but 13 men working below were trapped by falling naphtha and pieces of iron. The pumps were also destroyed, and the shaft began to fill with water. A worker named Mallory was lowered into the shaft by a rope the next day; he was overcome by fumes and reported no survivors, and no further rescue attempts were made.

Several months later, workers reached the shaft&#x27;s bottom and found that several victims had survived long enough to fashion a raft before suffocating.

==Operations==

The Troy and Boston Railroad and its Southern Vermont Railroad and Troy and Greenfield Railroad opened in 1859 from Troy, New York, on the New York Central Railroad and Hudson River Railroad, east to North Adams at the west portal of the tunnel.

The 1863 state buyout of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad opened the way for competition through the tunnel. The Boston, Hoosac Tunnel and Western Railway was organized in 1877 to build from near the Massachusetts–Vermont border, where state ownership ended, parallel to the Troy and Boston Railroad to near Johnsonville, New York and then west via Schenectady to Rotterdam Junction on what became the New York, West Shore, and Buffalo Railway in 1883. The line was being planned as a part of the Delaware and Hudson Company&#x27;s system and as part of the Erie Railroad system via the Delaware and Hudson Company&#x27;s Albany and Susquehanna Railroad. East of Greenfield, the east end of state ownership, the BHT&amp;W would have built its own line to terminal facilities at Winthrop.

The first train passed through the tunnel on February 9, 1875. Regular service via the tunnel between Boston and Troy, New York began the following year. The tunnel and Troy and Greenfield Railroad were bought by the Fitchburg Railroad in 1877, which year is inscribed on the East Portal entrance arch. The Boston and Maine Railroad bought the Fitchburg Railroad in 1900.

Competition between the two companies caused various court challenges to be made. In late 1878, the T&amp;B attempted to evict the BHT&amp;W from the roadbed of the abandoned Albany Northern Railroad between Hart&#x27;s Falls and Eagle Bridge. The BHT&amp;W lost that case, but continued to use the right-of-way. The case lasted until late 1881, when it was overturned. In May, 1879, a frog war was feared at Hoosick Junction, where the BHT&amp;W was to cross the T&amp;B&#x27;s Troy and Bennington Railroad. In July, Cornelius Vanderbilt, who owned the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, acquired a controlling interest in the T&amp;B, threatening to build a branch to Saratoga Springs unless the BHT&amp;W/D&amp;H alliance was ended. In November, an appellate court ruled that the application to cross the Troy and Bennington was improperly made to the Troy and Boston, and the T&amp;B claimed that the improvements, including a stone bridge, were forfeit.

The first train ran over the full BHT&amp;W to Mechanicville on December 6, 1879, and revenue service began December 20, with general offices at North Adams. In 1881, the BHT&amp;W was being planned as part of a larger system west to Oswego and Buffalo. The line was not built, but the BHT&amp;W opened an extension west to Rotterdam Junction on the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad took over the NYWS&amp;B in 1885, and in 1887 the Fitchburg Railroad bought both the T&amp;B and the BHT&amp;W, as well at the Troy and Greenfield Railroad, including the tunnel, ending the rivalry.

In 1910, the tunnel was electrified with the goal of reducing smoke and increasing the speed of traffic. Three years later, traffic within the tunnel was so heavy, at 70,000 cars a month, that the power plant in Adams, with its 6000 kW generator, could not keep up. Power was then drawn from a nearby dam north of the eastern entrance. In 1926, of the western end of the tunnel were deepened by .

Electrification ended in the tunnel in 1946 with the advent of diesel locomotives, and a fan was installed in the Central Shaft to remove Diesel exhaust fumes. Today, the Central Shaft system remains in place; however, ventilation relies on a single fan operating on low power due to the low number of trains on the line.

The last regularly-scheduled Boston and Maine Railroad passenger train, the &quot;Minute Man,&quot; passed through the tunnel in 1958.

In 2009, ownership of the tunnel was transferred to Pan Am Southern, a 50-50 joint venture of Pan Am Railways and Norfolk Southern Railway. Freight trains through the tunnel are operated by Springfield Terminal Railway, the train-operating subsidiary of Pan Am Railways.

The route is used for freight now, and has seen passenger excursion trains on rare occasions. It was converted to a single track in 1957. Clearances were increased in 1997 and 2007, the former by lowering the track, the latter by grinding 15 inches (38 cm) off the roof, allowing trailer on flat car (TOFC) and tri-level automobile carriers to pass. In March 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration granted $2 million to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation for preliminary engineering to increase clearance in the tunnel for double stack container trains. In 2019, MassDOT, with FRA support, had surveyed the Patriot Corridor, including the Hoosac Tunnel, and identified 19 improvement projects needed for double-stack clearance; MassDOT was preparing needed environmental reviews.

On February 12, 2020, the tunnel collapsed about from the West Portal. More collapses occurred in the following days. While crews repaired the tunnel, freight traffic was diverted over the New England Central Railroad and Vermont Railway, and Intermodal traffic was diverted via CSX during the closure. The tunnel reopened on April 4, 2020.

In 2023, about five freight trains use the tunnel each day.

===CSX acquisition of Pan Am Railways===
On November 30, 2020, an agreement was announced for CSX Corporation (parent company for CSX Transportation) to acquire Pan Am Systems. With the sale, the intermodal traffic between Mechanicville and Ayer will be re-routed over the B&amp;A to Worcester, MA. From there the traffic will come up the Worcester main and into Ayer Yard.

On April 14, 2022, The Surface Transportation Board fully accepted the purchase by CSX Transportation of Pan Am Railways and 50% of Pan Am Southern. The combination of several trackage rights agreements in the approved plan will create a new route allowing Norfolk Southern to move double-stack intermodal trains and automobile trains from Voorheesville, New York to Ayer, Massachusetts (the Southern Route). The Hoosac Tunnel on the Pan Am Southern (the Northern Route), used by NS prior to this agreement, is too low for double-stack trains. Berkshire &amp; Eastern Railroad (B&amp;E), a wholly owned subsidiary of Genesee &amp; Wyoming (G&amp;W), will replace Springfield Terminal as the operator of Pan Am Southern and the tunnel. CSX made specific commitments in its filings and entered into settlement agreements with numerous parties that had initially raised concerns about the transaction.

<doc id="1103547" wikidata="Q1493657" url="?curid=1103547" title="Brainstorm (1983 film)">
<text>Brainstorm is a 1983 American science fiction film directed by Douglas Trumbull, and starring Christopher Walken, Natalie Wood (in her final film role), Louise Fletcher, and Cliff Robertson.

It follows a research team&#x27;s efforts to perfect a system that directly records and replays the sensory experiences and emotional feelings of a subject, and the efforts by the company&#x27;s management to exploit the device for military ends. After a researcher records her own death from a heart attack, her colleagues join forces to retrieve the information and play it back.

== Plot ==
Scientists invent a brain–computer interface that records sensations from a person&#x27;s brain on tape for others to experience. The team includes estranged husband and wife Michael and Karen, as well as Michael&#x27;s colleague Lillian. At CEO Alex&#x27;s instruction, the team demonstrates the device to investors to gain financing.

Karen dons the recorder while working with Michael and Lillian. When Michael plays the tape back, the group realizes that emotional experiences are also recorded. Michael tapes his memories of times with Karen, which he shares with her, leading to their reconciliation.

Backers pressure Lillian to accept Landan on the team. She vehemently opposes their plan to have the invention developed for military use.

One team member, Gordy, has sexual intercourse while wearing the recorder, and shares the tape with colleagues, including Hal. Hal splices one section of the tape into a continuous orgasm, which results in sensory overload, leading to his forced retirement. Tensions increase as the possibilities for abuse—and not only by the military-industrial complex—become clear.

A chain smoker, Lillian suffers from heart problems. She has a heart attack while working alone. Realizing she is about to die, Lillian records her experience.

Michael decides to play Lillian&#x27;s recording, but nearly dies when his body relives her heart attack. Michael modifies his console to filter the physical output and replays the tape. He sees &quot;memory bubbles&quot;—moments from Lillian&#x27;s life. Michael experiences Lillian&#x27;s memories of a humorous exchange with Michael as he plays with an industrial robot, a surprise birthday party, and being devastated when Alex tells her that an earlier project is canceled.

Landan&#x27;s men monitor the equipment while Michael plays Lillian&#x27;s tape. They have Gordy plug in, but Landan ignores the staff&#x27;s warning that Michael modified his terminal. Gordy dies from experiencing Lillian&#x27;s heart attack.

Michael&#x27;s playback is cut short by Hal, but witnessing the near-death experience makes Michael eager to see the entire tape. Alex has the recording locked away and tells Michael he will not be allowed to view it. When he returns to work, Michael walks in on Landan and outside technicians going through his research records. Alex responds to his protests by firing Michael and Karen.

Michael attempts to hack into the lab&#x27;s computers. Hal advises him to look under &quot;Project Brainstorm&quot;, a program the military created to use their invention for torture and brainwashing. Michael accesses a tape from his den and quickly stops viewing it because of its disturbing nature. Michael and Karen&#x27;s son Chris inadvertently views the tape, causing a psychotic break that requires hospitalization. Alex visits and Michael confronts him about Project Brainstorm, blaming Alex for his son&#x27;s condition. Alex denies any knowledge of the project, then informs Michael of Gordy&#x27;s death.

Michael vows to destroy his work and enlists the help of Karen and Hal. Michael and Karen head to the Pinehurst Resort, and realizing they are under surveillance, stage a fight that ends in Karen leaving for Hal&#x27;s house. As the two feign reconciliation over the phone, Michael accesses the Brainstorm computer via another phone line while Karen hacks into the system, sabotaging the robots that manufacture the interface terminals. They run amok.

Karen shuts down the security system, locking the staff outside. Michael loads Lillian&#x27;s tape. With the plant in chaos, Robert orders Michael&#x27;s arrest.

Karen leaves to meet with Michael at a place important to them. Hal and his wife, Wendy, send the last of Karen&#x27;s commands to the company computers, shutting down the plant.

Karen follows Michael to a phone booth at the Wright Brothers memorial. The tape plays. Michael bears witness to the afterlife, experiencing a vision of hell, then traveling from Earth and through the universe, even after the tape ends. He ultimately has visions of angels and departed souls flying into a great cosmic Light. Then he collapses. Karen, believing him dead or dying, screams at him, over and over, demanding that he stay with her. Awakening, weeping with joy, Michael points up and whispers, “Look at the stars!” Their embrace, enclosed in a memory bubble, floats into the night.

== Production ==
To prepare for the film, Trumbull took most of the key cast and crew to the Esalen Institute, an experimental research facility in Northern California known for its new-age classes and workshops. In September 1981, the cast and crew traveled to North Carolina to begin six weeks of shooting at locations including the Elion-Hitchings Building in Research Triangle Park and Duke University, then returned to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City, California in November to film interior scenes.

=== Natalie Wood&#x27;s death ===
Production of &quot;Brainstorm&quot; was nearly discontinued after Natalie Wood&#x27;s death during a production break in November 1981. By this point, Wood had already completed all of her major scenes, but due to mounting financial problems, MGM took Wood&#x27;s death as an opportunity to terminate the already troubled production. &quot;When she died,&quot; said Trumbull, &quot;all the sets were locked and frozen on all the stages. No one could get in or out without special permission while all the negotiations took place.&quot;

Trumbull believed that financially strapped MGM simply got cold feet about providing the remainder of the funds to complete &quot;Brainstorm&quot;. &quot;MGM&#x27;s problem was that insurance institution Lloyd&#x27;s of London, when it took depositions from me and other people, realized that the film could be finished. Why should they pay an insurance claim for something that really wasn&#x27;t damaged goods?&quot; When MGM refused to pay for the film to be completed, Lloyd&#x27;s of London provided $2.75 million for Trumbull to complete principal photography and an additional $3.5 million towards post-production. Meanwhile, other studios showed interest in buying &quot;Brainstorm&quot; from MGM to release as their own production. &quot;MGM decided to allow Lloyd&#x27;s of London to offer the film to many of the major studios in town,&quot; said Trumbull. &quot;Several of them made bids to MGM. And the studio suddenly realized that a lot of other people in this town were excited about &quot;Brainstorm&quot;, and were ready to put up millions of dollars. MGM figured they&#x27;d look like jerks if they let it go and it turned out to be a big success. So they finally decided to work out this deal where Lloyd&#x27;s of London would put up the remaining money and become a profit participant.&quot; Trumbull proceeded to complete the film by rewriting the script and using Natalie Wood&#x27;s younger sister Lana for Wood&#x27;s few remaining scenes. The film carries the dedication credit &quot;To Natalie&quot;.

=== Effects ===
The film was conceived as an introduction to Trumbull&#x27;s Showscan 60 frames-per-second 70 mm film process. &quot;In movies people often do flashbacks and point-of-view shots as a gauzy, mysterious, distant kind of image,&quot; Trumbull recalled. &quot;And I wanted to do just the opposite, which was to make the material of the mind even more real and high-impact than &#x27;reality&#x27;&quot;.

MGM withdrew its plans to release the experimental picture in the new format. Trumbull instead shot the virtual reality sequences in 24 frames-per-second Super Panavision 70 with an aspect ratio of 2.2:1. The rest of the film was shot in conventional 35mm with an aspect ratio of approximately 1.7 to 1.

=== Soundtrack ===
The score to &quot;Brainstorm&quot; was composed and conducted by James Horner. The score won the Saturn Award for Best Music in 1983. The &quot;Varèse Sarabande&quot; album/CD release is a re-recording with the London Symphony Orchestra, produced shortly before the original theatrical release.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Brainstorm&quot; was released on September 30, 1983, almost two years after Wood&#x27;s death. However, it opened on a small number of screens and with little publicity despite being lauded unofficially as &quot;Natalie Wood&#x27;s last movie&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 57% of 21 critics have given the film a positive review with an average rating of 5.69/10.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave particular credit to Louise Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;superb performance&quot;. Christopher John reviewed &quot;Brainstorm&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; Special Edition #2 and commented that &quot;For those looking for nothing more than the same old spaceships and monsters, well, this one probably isn&#x27;t for you – but then again, you&#x27;ve got all the movies you need this year. &quot;Brainstorm&quot; is for the rest of us.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a mixed 2 stars out of a possible 4, describing the premise as &quot;a good idea for a movie&quot; and credited Trumbull with providing &quot;intriguing&quot; special effects. However, Ebert thought the cast was not used well: &quot;The characters take such a secondary importance to the gadget that we never feel much for them.&quot;

The film was not a commercial success, with a production budget of $18 million and grossing only $10 million in ticket sales in North America.

Because of the immensely troubled production and disagreements with MGM, Trumbull opted never to direct a Hollywood film again. In 1983 he stated:

In 2013, he explained that the uncertain circumstances of Natalie Wood&#x27;s death were the main reason for this decision. He later returned to filmmaking.

=== Accolades ===
At the 11th Saturn Awards, &quot;Brainstorm&quot; won Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Music for James Horner. It also received nominations for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director, Best Special Effects and a posthumous Best Supporting Actress nomination for Natalie Wood.

<text>A passenger railroad car or passenger car (American English), also called a passenger carriage, passenger coach (British English and International Union of Railways), or passenger bogie (Indian English) is a railroad car that is designed to carry passengers, usually giving them space to sit on train seats. The term &quot;passenger car&quot; can also be associated with a sleeping car, a baggage car, a dining car, railway post office and prisoner transport cars.

The first passenger cars were built in the early 1800s with the advent of the first railroads, and were small and little more than converted freight cars. Early passenger cars were constructed from wood; in the 1900s construction shifted to steel and later aluminum for improved strength. Passenger cars have increased greatly in size from their earliest versions, with modern bi-level passenger cars capable of carrying over 100 passengers. Amenities for passengers have also improved over time, with developments such as lighting, heating, and air conditioning added for improved passenger comfort. In some systems a choice is given between first- and second-class carriages, with a premium being paid for the former.

In some countries, such as the UK, coaching stock that is designed, converted or adapted to not carry passengers, is referred to as &quot;NPCS&quot; (non-passenger coaching stock); similarly, in the US, some maintenance (engineering) stock can be known as &quot;MOW&quot; (maintenance of way).

==History==
===19th century: First passenger cars and early development===
Up until about the end of the 19th century, most passenger cars were constructed of wood. The first passenger trains did not travel very far, but they were able to haul many more passengers for a longer distance than wagons pulled by horses.

As railways were first constructed in England, so too were the first passenger cars. One of the early coach designs was the &quot;Stanhope&quot;. It featured a roof and small holes in the floor for drainage when it rained, and had separate compartments for different classes of travel. The only problem with this design is that the passengers were expected to stand for their entire trip. The first passenger cars in the United States resembled stagecoaches. They were short, often less than long and had two axles.

A British company developed the first design for sleeping carriages, called &quot;bed-carriages&quot;, which were built in 1838 for the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway. When made up for sleeping, the foot of the bed was extended into a boot section at the end of the carriage. The cars were still too short to allow more than two or three beds to be positioned end to end.

Britain&#x27;s Royal Mail commissioned and built the first travelling post office cars in the late 1840s as well. These cars resembled coaches in their short wheelbase and exterior design, but were equipped with nets on the sides of the cars to catch mail bags while the train was in motion. American RPOs, first appearing in the 1860s, also featured equipment to catch mail bags at speed, but the American design more closely resembled a large hook that would catch the mailbag in its crook. When not in use, the hook would swivel down against the side of the car to prevent it from catching obstacles.

As locomotive technology progressed in the mid-19th century, trains grew in length and weight. Passenger cars, particularly in America, grew along with them, first getting longer with the addition of a second truck (one at each end), and wider as their suspensions improved. Cars built for European use featured side door compartments, while American car design favored what was called a train coach, a single long cabin with rows of seats, with doors located at the ends of the car. Early American sleeping cars were not compartmented, but by the end of the 19th century they were. The compartments in the later sleepers were accessed from a side hall running the length of the cars, similar to the design of European cars well into the 20th century.

Many American passenger trains, particularly the long distance ones, included a car at the end of the train called an observation car. Until about the 1930s, these had an open-air platform at the rear, the &quot;observation platform&quot;. These evolved into the closed end car, usually with a rounded end which was still called an &quot;observation car&quot;. The interiors of observation cars varied. Many had special chairs and tables.

The end platforms of all passenger cars changed around the turn of the 20th century. Older cars had open platforms between cars. Passengers would enter and leave a car through a door at the end of the car which led to a narrow platform. Steps on either side of the platform were used for getting on or off the train, and one might hop from one car platform to another. Later cars had enclosed platforms called vestibules which together with gangway connections allowed passengers not only to enter and exit the train protected from the elements, but also to move more easily between cars with the same protection.

Dining cars first appeared in the late 1870s and into the 1880s. Until this time, the common practice was to stop for meals at restaurants along the way (which led to the rise of Fred Harvey&#x27;s chain of Harvey House restaurants in America). At first, the dining car was simply a place to serve meals that were picked up en route, but they soon evolved to include galleys in which the meals were prepared. The introduction of vestibuled cars, which for the first time allowed easy movement from car to car, aided the adoption of dining cars, lounge cars, and other specialized cars.

===1900–1950: Transition from wood to steel, new car types===
In the early 1900s, safety concerns led the railroad industry to transition from wood to steel construction. Steel was heavier but this transition took place simultaneously with a transition to higher-powered locomotives. The Pennsylvania Railroad began building all-steel passenger cars in 1906 due to concerns about fire in the tunnels it was building to access Manhattan&#x27;s Pennsylvania Station, which opened in 1910. Other railroads followed because steel cars were safer in accidents. During a transition period, some railroads put steel frames underneath wooden cars.

By the 1920s, passenger cars on the larger standard gauge railroads were normally between and long. The cars of this time were still quite ornate, many of them being built by experienced coach makers and skilled carpenters. In the United States, the so-called &quot;chair car&quot; with individual seating became commonplace on long-distance routes.

With the 1930s came the widespread use of stainless steel for car bodies. The typical passenger car was now much lighter than its carbon-steel cousins of old, though still much heavier than nineteenth-century wooden cars. The new &quot;lightweight&quot; and streamlined cars carried passengers in speed and comfort to an extent that had not been experienced to date. Aluminum and Cor-Ten steel were also used in lightweight car construction, but stainless steel was the preferred material for car bodies. Stainless steel cars could be and often were, left unpainted except for the car&#x27;s reporting marks that were required by law.

By the end of the 1930s, railroads and car builders were debuting car body and interior styles that could only be dreamed of before. In 1937, the Pullman Company delivered the first cars equipped with roomettes – that is, the car&#x27;s interior was sectioned off into compartments, much like the coaches that were still in widespread use across Europe. Pullman&#x27;s roomettes, however, were designed with a single traveller in mind. The roomette featured a large picture window, a privacy door, a single fold-away bed, a sink and a small toilet. The roomette&#x27;s floor space was barely larger than the space taken up by the bed, but it allowed the traveller to ride in luxury compared to the multilevel semiprivate berths of old.

Now that passenger cars were lighter, they were able to carry heavier loads, but the size of the average passenger that rode in them didn&#x27;t increase to match the cars&#x27; new capacities. The average passenger car could not be made any wider or longer due to side clearances along the railroad lines, but they generally could get taller because they were still lower than many freight cars and locomotives. The railroads soon began building and buying dome and bilevel cars to carry more passengers.

===1950–present: High-technology advancements===

Starting in the 1950s, the passenger travel market declined in North America, though there was growth in commuter rail. Private intercity passenger service in the U.S. mostly ended with the creation of Amtrak in 1971. Amtrak took over equipment and stations from most of the railroads in the U.S. with intercity service.

The higher clearances in North America enabled a major advancement in passenger car design, bi-level (double-decker) commuter coaches that could hold more passengers. These cars started to become common in the United States in the 1960s, and were adopted by Amtrak for the Superliner design as well as by many other railroads and manufacturers. By 2000, double-deckers rivaled single level cars in use around the world.

While intercity passenger rail travel declined in America, ridership continued to increase in other parts of the world. With the increase came an increased use of newer technology on existing and new equipment. The Spanish company Talgo began experimenting in the 1940s with technology that would enable the axles to steer into a curve, allowing the train to move around the curve at a higher speed. The steering axles evolved into mechanisms that would also tilt the passenger car as it entered a curve to counter the centrifugal force experienced by the train, further increasing speeds on existing track. Today, Talgo trains are used in many places in Europe and they have also found a home in North America on some short and medium distance routes such as Eugene, Oregon, to Vancouver, British Columbia.

Another type of tilting train that is seeing widespread use across Europe is the Pendolino. These trains, built by Fiat Ferroviaria (now owned by Alstom), are in regular service in Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. Using tilting trains, railroads are able to run passenger trains over the same tracks at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible.

Amtrak continued to push the development of U.S.-designed passenger equipment even when the market demand didn&#x27;t support it, ordering a number of new passenger locomotive and car types in the 1980s and 1990s. However, by 2000 Amtrak went to European manufacturers for the Amtrak Cascades (Talgo) and Acela Express trains, their premier services. These trains use new designs and are made to operate as coherent &quot;trainsets&quot;.

High-speed trains are made up of cars from a single manufacturer and usually of a uniform design (although the dining car on the German ICE 1 has a dome). In the 1960s and 1970s countries around the world started to develop trains capable of traveling in the 150–200 mph range, to rival air travel. One of the first was France&#x27;s TGV which entered service in 1981. By 2000, Western Europe&#x27;s major cities (London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Geneva, Berlin, Rome, etc.) were connected by high-speed rail service.

Often tilting and high-speed cars are left in &quot;trainsets&quot; throughout their service. For example, articulated cars cannot be uncoupled without special equipment because the individual cars share trucks. This gives modern trains a smooth, coherent appearance because all the cars and often the engines share a similar design and paint scheme.

== Car types ==
Traditionally the passenger car can be split into a number of distinct types.

The most basic division is between cars which do carry passengers and &quot;head end&quot; equipment. The latter are run as part of passenger trains, but do not themselves carry passengers. Traditionally they were put between the locomotive and the passenger-carrying cars in the consist, hence the name.

Some specialized types are variants of or combine elements of the most basic types.

Also, the basic design of passenger cars is evolving, with articulated units that have shared trucks, with double-decker designs, and with the &quot;low floor&quot; design where the loading area is very close to the ground and slung between the trucks.

===Passenger-carrying types===

====Coach====

The coach is the most basic type of passenger car, also sometimes referred to as &quot;chair cars&quot;.
#Open/Saloon
#Compartment
#Composite
Two main variants exist.

=====Open coach=====

In one variant, an &quot;open coach&quot; has a central aisle; the car&#x27;s interior is often filled with row upon row of seats as in a passenger airliner. Other arrangements of the &quot;open&quot; type are also found, including seats around tables, seats facing the aisle (often found on mass transit trains since they increase standing room for rush hour), and variations of all three. Seating arrangement is typically [2+2], while the hard seat in China has [3+2] arrangements. The seating arrangements and density, as well as the absence or presence of other facilities depends on the intended use – from mass transit systems to long distance luxury trains. Some cars have reclining seats to allow for easier sleeping by passengers not traveling in a sleeping car.

=====Compartment=====

In another variant, &quot;closed&quot; coaches, &quot;corridor&quot; coaches or &quot;compartment&quot; cars have a side corridor to connect individual compartments along the body of the train, each with two rows of seats facing each other.

In both arrangements carry-on baggage is stowed on a shelf above the passenger seating area. The opening into the cars is usually located at both ends of the carriage, often into a small hallway – which in railway parlance is termed a vestibule. Earlier designs of UK coaching stock had additional door or doors along their length, some supporting compartmentalised carriages.

===== Compartment coach =====
The compartment coach is similar to a corridor coach but without the corridor. Each compartment is totally separated from the other compartments, with no movement between them. Entry and exit from each compartment is only possible when stopped at a station.

=====Composite=====
&quot;Composite&quot; coaches are also known. These are mixed-class cars featuring both open seating and compartments. One such coach is the Composite Corridor, introduced for British Rail in the 1950s; though such coaches existed from early pre-grouping days, at the end of the 19th century.

In India, normal carriages often have double height seating, with benches (berths), so that people can sit above one another (not unlike a bunk bed). In other countries, true double decker carriages are becoming more common. The seats in most coaches until the middle of the 20th century were usually bench seats; the backs of these seats could be adjusted, often with one hand, to face in either direction so the car would not have to be turned for a return trip. The conductor would simply walk down the aisle in the car, reversing the seat backs to prepare for the return trip. This arrangement is still used in some modern trains.

====Dining car====
A dining car (or diner) is used to serve meals to the passengers. Its interior may be split with a portion of the interior partitioned off for a galley, which is off-limits to passengers. A narrow hallway is left between the galley and one side wall of the car for passengers to use. The remainder of the interior is laid out with tables and chairs to look like a long, narrow restaurant dining room. There are special personnel to perform waitstaff and kitchen duties.

====Lounge====

Lounge cars carry a bar and public seating. They usually have benches, armchairs or large swivelling chairs along the sides of the car. They often have small tables for drinks, or may be large enough to play cards. Some lounge cars include small pianos and are staffed by contracted musicians to entertain the passengers.

These cars are often pulled in addition to the dining car, and on very long trains in addition to one or more snack or café cars. Café cars, such as the Amtrak café cars, are simpler, lacking window-facing seats, instead, rows of tables with facing pairs of bench seats, split by a food and drink counter.

Lounge cars are an important part of the appeal of passenger trains when compared to aircraft, buses and cars; there is more space to move around, socialize, eat and drink, and a good view.

====Observation====
The observation car almost always operated as the last car in a passenger train, in US practice. Its interior could include features of a coach, lounge, diner, or sleeper. The main spotting feature was at the tail end of the car – some more modern US designs had walls of the car usually curved together to form a large U shape, and larger windows were installed all around the end of the car; earlier designs had square ends with an observation open deck (preserved stock in Southern Africa, Oceania and many countries elsewhere.) Before these cars were built with steel walls, the observation end of heavyweight cars in the US and Canada resembled a roofed porch area. Larger windows were installed at the observation end on these cars as well. At this end of the car, there was almost always a lounge where passengers could enjoy the view as they watched the track rapidly recede into the distance.
====Sleeping car====
Often called &quot;sleepers&quot; or &quot;Pullman cars&quot; (after the main American operator), these cars provide sleeping arrangements for passengers travelling at night. Early models were divided into sections, where coach seating converted at night into semi-private berths. More modern interiors are normally partitioned into separate bedroom compartments for passengers. The beds are designed in such a way that they either roll or fold out of the way or convert into seats for daytime use. Compartments vary in size; some are large enough for only a bed, while others resemble efficiency apartments including bathrooms.

In China, sleeping cars still serve as major travel classes in long-range rail transport. The classes of sleeping cars include hard sleeper (YW) with six bunks per compartment, soft sleeper (RW) typically with four bunks, deluxe soft sleeper (GRW) typically with two bunks.

====Trailer car====

A similar car which was usually found in DMUs, EMUs, and locomotive-hauled passenger trainsets. They also generally intermediate cars within the consist and sometimes have driving control facilities. They may carry auxiliary equipment (E.g. the braking system, air conditioning, etc.) where space is limited.

===Head-end equipment===
====Baggage car====
Although passengers generally are not allowed access to the baggage car, they were included in a great number of passenger trains as regular equipment. The baggage car is a car that was normally placed between the train&#x27;s motive power and the remainder of the passenger train. The car&#x27;s interior is normally wide open and is used to carry passengers&#x27; checked baggage. Baggage cars were also sometimes commissioned by freight companies to haul less-than-carload (LCL) shipments along passenger routes (Railway Express Agency was one such freight company). Some baggage cars included restroom facilities for the train crew, so many baggage cars had doors to access them just like any other passenger car. Baggage cars could be designed to look like the rest of a passenger train&#x27;s cars, or they could be repurposed box cars equipped with high-speed trucks and passenger train steam and air connections. A special type of baggage car came equipped with doors on one end to facilitate transport of large pieces of equipment and scenery for Broadway shows and other productions. These &quot;theatrical&quot; baggage cars were assigned theatrical names (i.e. &quot;Romeo&quot; and &quot;Juliet&quot;), and were similar to the &quot;horse cars&quot; that were used to transport racehorses.

====Express car====
Express cars carry high-value freight in passenger consists. These cars often resembled baggage cars, although in some cases specially-equipped boxcars or refrigerator cars were used. In the United States, the majority of these cars were operated by Railway Express Agency (REA) from 1918 to 1975. Following REA&#x27;s bankruptcy, Amtrak took over express type shipments under the Amtrak Express brand, eventually introducing rolling stock like material handling cars, Roadrailers. Amtrak mostly exited the express business in 2003, now only using extra space in baggage cars on trains.

====Prisoner car====
In some countries, such as Russia, convicts are transported from court to prison or from one prison to another by railway. In such transportation a specific type of coach, prisoner car, is used. It contains several cell compartments with minimal interior and commodities, and a separate guard compartment. Usually the windows are of nontransparent opaque glass to prevent prisoners from seeing outside and determine where they are, and windows usually also have bars to prevent escapes. Unlike other passenger cars, prisoner cars do not have doors at the ends of the wagon.

====Railway post office====

Like baggage cars, railway post office (RPO; US term) cars or travelling post offices (TPOs; British term) were not accessible to paying passengers. These cars&#x27; interiors were designed with sorting facilities that were often seen and used in conventional post offices around the world. The RPO is where mail was sorted while the train was en route. Because these cars carried mail, which often included valuables or quantities of cash and checks, the RPO staff (who were employed by the postal service and not the railroad) were the only train crews allowed to carry guns. The RPO cars were normally placed in a passenger train between the train&#x27;s motive power and baggage cars, further inhibiting their access by passengers.

===Specialized types===
====Colonist Car====

A colonist car or emigrant car was a special sleeping car designed to take immigrants from ocean ports to settlement areas in western North America at the cheapest possible fare. They offered simple sleeping berths and a cooking area for immigrants who were expected to bring their own food and bedding.

====Combine====

A combine is a car that combines features of a head-end and a regular passenger car. The most common combination is that of a coach and a baggage car, but the combination of coach and post office car was also common. Combines were used most frequently on branch lines and short line railroads where there wasn&#x27;t necessarily enough traffic to economically justify single-purpose cars. As lightweight cars began to appear on railroads, passenger cars more frequently combined features of two or more car types on one car, and the classic heavyweight combine fell out of use.

====Control car (cab)====

A control car (also known as a Driving Trailer in Europe and the UK) is a passenger car which lets the train be run in reverse with the locomotive at the back. It is common on commuter trains in the US, Canada and Europe. This can be important for serving small towns without extensive switching facilities, end train stations, dead-end lines, and having a fast turnaround when changing directions in commuter service.
====Dome car====

A dome car can include features of a coach car, sleeping car, a lounge car, dining car, and an observation car. Within the United States, the primary manufacturers were The Budd Company (stainless steel construction), The Pullman Company (steel construction), and ACF (American Car &amp; Foundry, aluminum construction). A portion of the car, usually in the center, is split between two levels, with stairs leading both up and down from the train&#x27;s regular passenger car floor level. The lower level of the dome usually consisted of a small lounge area, while the upper portion was usually coach or lounge seating within a &quot;bubble&quot; of glass on the car&#x27;s roof. Budd Co. dome cars used curved glass, whereas Pullman company cars used flat panels of glass that were positioned at different angles above the roofline. Passengers in the upper portion of the dome were able to see in all directions from a vantage point above the train&#x27;s roof line. On some dome cars, the lower portion was built as a galley, where car attendants used dumbwaiters to transfer items between the galley and a dining area in the dome portion of the car. In the United States, the Union Pacific railroad was the primary user of dome dining cars in the pre-Amtrak era.

Some dome cars were built with the dome extending the entire length of the car (a &quot;full dome&quot; car), while others had only a small observation bubble. There were also combination dome-observation cars built which were meant to be the last car on the train, with both rear observation and the dome up top. Dome observation cars came in both round end, and square end versions. The Union Pacific, in the US, was the primary user of square-end observation cars, prior to Amtrak, although the Burlington Route had several square-end cars of stainless steel.

====Double-decker or bilevel coach====

As passenger car construction improved to the point where dome cars were introduced, some passenger car manufacturers began building double decker passenger train cars for use in areas that are more heavily populated or to carry more passengers over a long distance while using fewer cars (such as Amtrak&#x27;s Superliner cars). Cars used on long-distance passenger trains could combine features of any of the basic car types, while cars used in local commuter service are often strictly coach types on both levels.

Double decker coaches were tried in the UK (SR Class 4DD) but the experiment was unsuccessful because the restricted British loading gauge resulted in cramped conditions.

====Drovers&#x27; car====
Drovers&#x27; cars were used on long distance livestock trains in the western United States. The purpose of a drovers&#x27; car was to accommodate the livestock&#x27;s handlers on the journey between the ranch and processing plant. They were usually shorter, older cars, and equipped with stove heaters, as no trainline steam heating was provided.

====Hospital car====
A variety of hospital trains operate around the world, employing specialist carriages equipped as hospital wards, treatment rooms, and full-scale operating theaters (US: operating rooms).

====Private car====

Many cars built by Pullman and other companies were either originally built or later converted for use as business and private cars which served as the &quot;private jet&quot; of the early-to-mid-20th century. They were used by railroad officials and dignitaries as business cars, and wealthy individuals for travel and entertainment. There are various configurations, but the cars generally have an observation platform and include a full kitchen, dining room, state rooms, secretary&#x27;s room, an observation room, and often servant&#x27;s quarters. A number of these private cars have survived the decades and some are used for tour rides, leasing for private events, etc. A small number of private cars (along with other types of passenger cars), have been upgraded to meet current Amtrak regulations, and may be chartered by their owners for private travel attached to Amtrak trains.

The only current example in Britain is the British Royal Train.

====Troop sleeper====
A &quot;troop sleeper&quot; was a railroad passenger car which had been constructed to serve as something of a mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, reducing the amount of transit time required and increasing travel efficiency. Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, also joined the consists in order to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals in their seats or bunks). Troop hospital cars, also based on the troop sleeper carbody, transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each.

===Car technology===
Passenger cars are as almost as old as railroading itself, and their development paralleled that of freight cars. Early two axle cars gave way to conventional two truck construction with the floor of the car riding above the wheels; link and pin couplers gave way to automatic types.

Several construction details characterized passenger equipment. Passenger trains were expected to run at higher speeds than freight service, and therefore passenger trucks evolved to allow superior ride and better tracking at those speeds. Over time, in most cases provision was made for passengers and train staff to move from car to car; therefore platforms and later vestibules were used to bridge the gap.

In later years a number of changes to this basic form were introduced to allow for improvements in speed, comfort, and expense.

====Articulated====

Articulated passenger cars are becoming increasingly common in Europe and the US. This means that the passenger cars share trucks and that the passageways between them are more or less permanently attached. The cars are kept in &quot;trainsets&quot; and not split up during normal operations.

Articulated cars have a number of advantages. They save on the total number of wheels and trucks, reducing costs and maintenance expenses. Further, movement between cars is safer and easier than with traditional designs. Finally, it is possible to implement tilting schemes such as the Talgo design which allow the train to lean into curves. The chief disadvantage is that failure of a single car disables the entire set, since individual cars cannot be readily switched in and out of the consist.

====Low-floor====
In some countries (such as the US), platform level may be below the level of the floor of passenger cars, resulting in a significant step up from platform level – leading to slower boarding times, which are important for high-capacity systems. Low-floor cars have their main passenger and loading floor directly on level with the loading platform, instead of having a step up to the passenger compartment as was traditional until around the 1970s. This is achieved by having a low-slung chassis with the &quot;low floor&quot; resting &quot;between&quot; the trucks, rather than resting completely on top with a simpler straight chassis design. This improved design is seen in many passenger cars today, especially double decker cars. The low floor enables easy access for bicycles, strollers, suitcases, wheelchairs and those with disabilities, which is otherwise not always convenient or even possible with the traditional passenger car design.

Within the United States, the Pennsylvania Railroad developed &#x27;The Keystone&#x27; 7 car set of cars with their own attached (head end) power car in the late 1950s. It was mostly used between New York City and Washington, DC. Boarding was at the normal platform level, at the end of the cars, with the centre section between the trucks lowered to give the cars a lower centre of gravity, and higher speed capability.

====Self-propelled passenger equipment====
These vehicles usually carry motive power in each individual unit. Trams, light rail vehicles and subways have been widely constructed in urban areas throughout the world since the late 19th century. By the year 1900, electric-powered passenger cars were ubiquitous in the developed world, but they fell into decline after World War II, especially in the U.S. By 2000 they had regained popularity and modern lines were being rebuilt where they had been torn up only 40 years earlier to make way for automobiles.

On lighter-trafficked rural railways, powered diesel cars (such as the Budd Rail Diesel Car) continue to be popular. In Germany, the new Talent design shows that the diesel-powered passenger car is still a viable part of rail service. In the UK, locomotive-hauled passenger trains have largely been replaced by diesel multiple units and electric multiple units, such as the Bombardier Voyager family and the Hitachi A-Train AT300 family, even on express services.

====Tilting====

These cars are able to tilt to counter the effects of inertia when turning, making the ride more comfortable for the passengers. Amtrak has adopted Talgo trainsets for its Amtrak Cascades service in the Pacific Northwest. Other manufacturers have also implemented tilting designs. The British Rail Class 390 is a tilting train operating in the UK.

==Lighting, heating, air-conditioning==
The earliest form of train lighting was provided by Colza oil lamps. The next stage was gas lighting, using compressed gas stored in cylinders under the coaches. Finally, electric lighting was introduced.

Early railway coaches had no heating but passengers could rent foot-warmers. These worked on the same principle as modern sodium acetate heating pads. Later, steam heating was introduced, using a steam supply from the steam locomotive. Steam heating continued into the diesel locomotive era, with steam supplied by a steam generator. Now, electric heating is almost universal and air-conditioning is often provided as well. In the case of diesel multiple units, the coaches may be heated by waste heat from the engines, as in an automobile.

In a subway car, tram or train, an insulator at a track switch may cut off power from the car for a few feet along the line and use a large capacitor to store energy to drive the subway car through the gap in the power feed.

<text>James Stephen Ewing ( ; December 25, 1866 in Pittsburgh – May 16, 1943 in New York City) was an American pathologist. He was the first professor of pathology at Cornell University and discovered a form of bone cancer that was later named after him, Ewing sarcoma.

==Life==
James Ewing, was born in 1866 to a prominent family of Pittsburgh. When he was 14 he was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and was bedridden for two years. He first completed his B.A. in 1888 at Amherst College and then studied medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York, from 1888 to 1891. He returned to the College of Physicians and Surgeons as instructor in histology (1893-1897), and clinical pathology (1897-1898). After a brief stint as a surgeon with the US Army, Ewing was appointed in 1899 the first professor of clinical pathology at the newly formed Medical College of Cornell University in New York, where he was the only full-time professor. In 1902, Ewing helped to establish one of the first funds for cancer research, endowed by Mrs. Collis P. Huntington. With his discoveries using that research funding, Ewing became the most important experimental oncologist and helped to found, in 1907, the American Association for Cancer Research, and in 1913, the American Society for the Control of Cancer, now the American Cancer Society. In 1906 Ewing, working with S.P. Beebe and collaborators, showed the first proof that a cancer (canine transmissible venereal tumor in dogs) could be transmissible.

In 1910, Ewing had approached New York Hospital about establishing a clinical research facility; when this fell through, he established a collaboration with Memorial Hospital (which would become Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) with the help of industrialist and philanthropist James Douglas, who gave $100,000 to endow twenty beds for clinical research, equipment for working with radium, and a clinical laboratory to Memorial for that purpose. Douglas&#x27; enthusiasm and funding for development of radiation therapy for cancer inspired Ewing to become one of the pioneers in developing this treatment. Ewing soon took over effective leadership of clinical and laboratory research at Memorial.

In 1919 Ewing published the first edition of &quot;Neoplastic Diseases: A Text-Book on Tumors&quot;. The book, which is translated into numerous languages, becomes a cornerstone of modern oncology by establishing a systematic and comprehensive basis for diagnosing human cancer. In 1921 he published a paper detailing a type of osteoma which later received his name: Ewing sarcoma.

In 1931 Ewing was formally appointed president of the hospital and was featured on the cover of Time Magazine as &quot;Cancer Man Ewing&quot;; the accompanying article described his role as one of the most important cancer doctors of his era. He worked at Memorial Hospital until his retirement in 1939. In 1942, he was presented with the prestigious gold-headed cane award of the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists.

Under his leadership, Memorial became a model for other cancer centers in the United States, combining patient care with clinical and laboratory research, and it was said of him that &quot;The relationship of Ewing to the Memorial Hospital can best be expressed in the words of Emerson, &#x27;Every institution is but the lengthening
shadow of some man.&#x27; Dr. Ewing is the Memorial Hospital&quot;.

In 1951, The James Ewing Hospital, a 12-story building on First Avenue between 67th and 68th Streets, opened; it was intended to treat cancer among New York City&#x27;s poor.

<text>Best of Ozz is a compilation album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. Released on 1 March 1989 by CBS/Sony in Japan only, it features songs from Osbourne&#x27;s first four studio albums, ranging from 1980&#x27;s &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; to 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Best of Ozz&quot; is a ten-track compilation featuring three tracks from &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;, two tracks from &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, two tracks from &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; and three tracks from &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot;. Amongst the tracks included are six singles, including &quot;Crazy Train&quot;, &quot;Over the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;.

==Reception==
Music website AllMusic awarded &quot;Best of Ozz&quot; three out of five stars; reviewer James Christopher Monger praised the album as &quot;one of the better collections out there&quot; due to the high quality of the original albums from which the songs are taken. Noting that the release only features ten tracks, Monger concluded by describing &quot;Best of Ozz&quot; as &quot;a nice little sampler of Osbourne&#x27;s early post-Sabbath career&quot;.

<doc id="1103580" wikidata="Q766952" url="?curid=1103580" title="Concrete block">
<text>A concrete block, also known as a cinder block in North American English, breeze block in British English, or concrete masonry unit (CMU), or by various other terms, is a standard-size rectangular block used in building construction. The use of blockwork allows structures to be built in the traditional masonry style with layers (or courses) of staggered blocks.

Concrete blocks may be produced with hollow centers (cores) to reduce weight, improve insulation and provide an interconnected void into which concrete can be poured to solidify the entire wall after it is built.

Concrete blocks are some of the most versatile building products available because of the wide variety of appearances that can be achieved using them.

== Naming ==

Those that use cinders (fly ash or bottom ash) as an aggregate material are called &quot;cinder blocks&quot; in the United States. They are also known as &quot;breeze blocks&quot;, a term derived from &quot;breeze&quot;, referring to the small cinders and cinder-dust that are created by partially burned coal. However, in the United States &quot;breeze blocks&quot; also refers specifically to decorative blocks used on exterior walls to allow the breeze through, which were an important feature of Mid-Century Modern design, popularised by Edward Durrell Stone.

In Australia, they are often known as besser blocks (because the Besser Company was a major supplier of machines that made concrete blocks), and also as grey blocks or concrete masonry units (CMUs).

Clinker blocks use clinker (ash created as a waste product from impurities in minerals such as coal, limestone and iron-ore), also called slag.

== Composition ==

Concrete blocks are made from cast concrete (e.g. portland cement and aggregate, usually sand and fine gravel, for high-density blocks). In the western United States, where they are easily obtainable, porous lava rock gravels are used for weight reduction. They also have an added decorative effect to certain types of block, such as split-face, due to their distinct red and black colors. Lower-density blocks may use industrial wastes, such as fly ash or bottom ash, as an aggregate.

Recycled materials, such as post-consumer glass, slag cement, or recycled aggregate, are often used in the composition of the blocks. Use of recycled materials within blocks can create different appearances in the block, such as a terrazzo finish, and may help the finished structure earn LEED certification.

Lightweight blocks can also be produced using autoclaved aerated concrete; these are widely used for construction in Finland and other Scandinavian countries, as well as in central Europe, for the material&#x27;s inherent thermal insulation characteristics, as are expanded clay aggregate blocks.

==Sizes and structure==

Blocks come in modular sizes, with the most popular typically referred to (by their thickness) as &quot;4-inch&quot;, &quot;6-inch&quot;, &quot;8-inch&quot;, and &quot;12-inch&quot;. In the US, concrete blocks are nominally long and wide. Their actual dimensions are less than the nominal dimensions (to allow for -inch mortar joints between blocks in any orientation). In Ireland and the UK, blocks are usually excluding mortar joints. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, blocks are usually excluding mortar joints.

Block cores are typically tapered so that their top surface (as laid) has a greater surface on which to spread a mortar bed and for easier handling. Most concrete blocks have two cores, but three- and four-core units are also produced. A core also allows for the insertion of steel reinforcement to span courses in order to increase tensile strength. This is accomplished by grouting the voids of blocks containing rebar with concrete. Thus reinforced, concrete block walls are better able to resist lateral forces such as wind load and seismic forces. Cores may also be filled with expanded-polystyrene (EPS) block foam insulation, substantially increasing the R-value of the resulting wall to be in compliance with the US national energy code.

A variety of specialized shapes exist to allow special construction features. U-shaped blocks, or knockout blocks, have notches to allow the construction of bond beams or lintel assemblies, using horizontal reinforcing grouted into place in the cavity. Blocks with a channel on the end, known as &quot;jamb blocks&quot;, allow doors to be secured to wall assemblies. Blocks with grooved ends permit the construction of control joints, allowing a filler material to be anchored between the un-mortared block ends. Other features, such as radiused corners known as &quot;bullnoses&quot;, may be incorporated. A wide variety of decorative profiles also exist.

Concrete blocks may be formulated with special aggregates to produce specific colors or textures for finish use. Special textures may be produced by splitting a ribbed or solid two-block unit; such factory-produced units are called &quot;split-rib&quot; or &quot;split-face&quot; blocks. Blocks may be scored by grooves the width of a mortar joint to simulate different block modules. For example, an block may be scored in the middle to simulate masonry, with the grooves filled with mortar and struck to match the true joints.

== Uses ==
Concrete block, when built with integral steel reinforcement, is a very common building material for the load-bearing walls of buildings, in what is termed &quot;concrete block structure&quot; (&quot;CBS&quot;) construction. One of the common foundation types for American suburban houses is the &quot;crawl space foundation&quot; which consists of a concrete block wall on the perimeter on which dimensional lumber floor joists are supported. Retaining walls, which can also be constructed of concrete blocks, can be constructed, either using blocks designed to be set back each course and used with a sand base and without mortar or reinforcing (gravity wall), or using blocks (typically an architectural style of block or clad with a veneer such as brick) with a concrete base, steel reinforcing and mortar (piling wall). Other very common, non-structural uses for concrete block walls (especially in American schools) are as interior fire-rated and extremely durable partition walls, and as exterior backup curtain walls for attachment of building envelope systems (rigid foam insulation and an air/vapor barrier) and veneers (stucco, steel, brick, or split-face concrete block).

== Properties ==

Concrete masonry walls may be ungrouted, partially grouted, or fully grouted, the latter two enhancing their structural strength. Additionally, steel reinforcement bars (rebar) can be used both vertically and horizontally inside a concrete block wall to maximize its structural performance. The cells in which the rebar is placed must be grouted for the bars to bond to the wall. For this reason, high-seismic zones typically allow only fully grouted walls in their building codes. The American design code that guides design engineers in using concrete blocks as a structural system is the &quot;Masonry Standards Joint Committee&#x27;s Building Code Requirements &amp; Specification for Masonry Structures&quot; (TMS 402/602-16).

The compressive strength of concrete blocks and masonry walls varies from approximately based on the type of concrete used to manufacture the unit, stacking orientation, the type of mortar used to build the wall, and whether it is a load-bearing partition or not, among other factors.

<doc id="1103589" wikidata="Q1976152" url="?curid=1103589" title="Red Elvises">
<text>The Red Elvises (also known as &quot;Igor and Red Elvises&quot;, after founding member and bandleader Igor Yuzov) are an American cult band that performs funk rock, surf, rockabilly, reggae, folk rock, disco and traditional Russian styles of music. They were founded in California in the mid-1990s and are based in Los Angeles.

== Early history ==
The Red Elvises were founded in 1995 by Igor Yuzov, Oleg Bernov, Zhenya Rock. Igor and Oleg met during a Russian-American peace walk and subsequently played together in a Russian folk-rock band called Limpopo. The band&#x27;s third original member, guitarist Zhenya Rock (a.k.a. Kolykhanov), had also emigrated to America and had been the lead guitarist of the Red Elvises until 2004. For the first few months Andrey Baranov was the band&#x27;s drummer, but within that year, the first American in the band, drummer Avi Sills from Austin, Texas, was added to the lineup. The band first began as an LA street act at Santa Monica&#x27;s 3rd Street Promenade.

== 1995–2001 ==
When they weren&#x27;t playing on the road they were busy recording and self-producing their own CDs. &quot;Grooving To The Moscow Beat&quot; was the band&#x27;s first release in 1996, followed by &quot;Surfing In Siberia&quot; in 1997. In 1998, the band released their breakthrough CD, &quot;I Wanna See You Bellydance&quot;. Their music filled the soundtrack of Lance Mungia&#x27;s independent film released in 1998, &quot;Six-String Samurai&quot; soundtrack and episode acting. With Mungia directing, the band also produced two music videos of songs from the &quot;Six-String Samurai&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Lovepipe&quot; and &quot;Boogie on the Beach&quot;, that year. A full-length concert video, &quot;Live on the Pacific Ocean&quot;, was also released, showcasing their appearance at the Santa Monica Pier&#x27;s Twilight Summer Concert Series.

The TV also beckoned with television show appearances, resulting in Red Elvises&#x27; guest spot in an episode of Fox television series &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (Episode #206, &quot;Suspicion&quot;) which aired on November 9, 1998. Near the end of that year, they appeared on FX&#x27;s &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s Sin City Spectacular&quot; accompanied by Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s show dancers, which aired in January 1999. They released three new recordings in 1999, two studio-produced and one live. The band&#x27;s fourth and fifth studio albums, &quot;Better Than Sex&quot; and &quot;Russian Bellydance&quot;, a Russian-language version of their smash album &quot;I Wanna See You Bellydance&quot; from the previous year, were both released in March 1999. Later in that same month, Red Elvises&#x27; performance in San Francisco was released as the band&#x27;s first live double album, &quot;Live at the Great American Music Hall&quot;.

In the summer of 1999, the FX television channel hired Red Elvises to play in Malibu on the beach for their &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; Swimsuit Beach Party highlighting a marathon airing of syndicated episodes of the hit series. FX held a contest and flew the winners and ten of their friends to the beach party to appear on TV and dance to the band&#x27;s music. Later, they provided the theme, score, and songs for the Cartoon Network animated series &quot;Mike, Lu &amp; Og&quot;. February 2000 heralded a brief change in musical direction for the band with the release of their seventh CD, &quot;Shake Your Pelvis&quot;, a more electronic techno/disco style CD that greatly differed from their earlier releases. December 2000 also saw an end to Avi Sills&#x27; association with the band with his decision to move on to other musical opportunities.

== 2001–2008 ==
In 2001 the band worked as a trio with Oleg Bernov on drums, Igor Yuzov on electric bass guitar and Zhenya Rock as lead guitarist.
In March 2001 two studio CDs were released, &quot;Welcome to the Freakshow&quot;, written entirely by Yuzov, and Bedroom Boogie, written entirely by Zhenya Rock. The group continued to tour America throughout the year and was also invited to tour Russia.

In 2002, Rokenrol was recorded entirely in Russian, with the exception of two songs (Juliet by I.Yuzov and Sunshine by Z.Rock) in English. Zhenya Rock began a side project, Zeerok, going in a completely different musical direction, and, by the end of the year, decided to commit to his new band full-time, announcing his departure from Red Elvises. The band kept busy during the summer months with a tour through Russia that included some filming for the film , a romantic action comedy starring Danny Aiello, Vincent Pastore, Ivana Milocevich, and Robert Capelli, Jr., returning home in August to record the soundtrack. The band also returned to television with an appearance playing themselves in an episode of the Fox action series &quot;Fastlane&quot; (Episode #3 &quot;Gone Native&quot;).
In 2003, Yuzov switched back to guitar, this time on lead, and Bernov returned to the large bass balalaika. Completing the new lineup was another Russian, Oleg &quot;Schramm&quot; Gorbunov on keyboards and accordion and new American drummer Adam Gust. 
In 2005, they were asked to perform in the Moscow Live8 concert, along with the Pet Shop Boys and a number of local performers. In 2006, Elena Shemankova from Moscow, the first female to ever play with Red Elvises, joined the band on keyboards and was very well received. The next year they were joined by female guitarist Beth Garner from Texas, who was with them for two American tours that year.

== 2009 to present ==
In early 2009, the Red Elvises announced that longtime member and bassist Bernov had decided to leave the band. Subsequent postings on their website announced either that he was on a &quot;friendly break&quot; or had gone on to start his own group. In February 2009, Bernov announced that he had joined the star-up project of the now world-famous show &quot;Slava&#x27;s Snowshow&quot; staged by Russian performance artist Slava Polunin, in which Bernov plays a stage role.

Later that month, Yuzov rolled out a new line-up called &quot;Igor and Red Elvises&quot;. The first performance under this new name took place at Rusty&#x27;s in Santa Monica. The concert was attended mainly by new members of the group (except for Yuzov and Gust). In April of the same year, they celebrated the anniversary of the founding of the group with free concerts on the embankment of 3rd Street in Santa Monica, for which Bernov temporarily rejoined the group.
Bern also joined the Red Elvises on keyboards and accordion for a tour in March 2010. Igor and Red Elvises continue the 2010 tour with core members Igor Yuzov on guitar, Oleg Bernov on bass balalaika, and Sarah Johnson on saxophone and keyboards. 
In September 2014, the band released their 12th studio album, Bacon. This would be the first non-live album released under the new name &quot;Igor and Red Elvises&quot;. In December 2014, Bernov again departed the band and continued his solo career.

== Success and tours in Russia ==
Since 2002, the group annually goes on tour to Russia, where they usually spend two summer months, playing in clubs in major cities such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg, as well as in their hometown of Yuzov in Odesa in Ukraine.

<text>Sydney Haldane Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier, (16 April 1859 – 15 February 1943) was a British civil servant. A Fabian and a member of the Labour Party, he served as Governor of Jamaica and as Secretary of State for India in the first government of Ramsay MacDonald. He was the uncle of the actor Laurence Olivier.

==Background==

Olivier was born in Colchester, the second of eight children of Anne Elizabeth Hardcastle Arnould and the Reverend Henry Arnold Olivier, a stern Anglican. His brothers included Henry (1850–1935), who had a military career ending as a colonel, Herbert, a successful portrait painter, and Gerard (1869–1939), a clergyman (the father of Laurence). During Olivier&#x27;s youth, the family spent time at Lausanne and Kineton, and at Poulshott in Wiltshire, where Henry Olivier was rector. Sydney Olivier was sent to Tonbridge School, and then studied philosophy and theology at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At Oxford he became a close friend of Graham Wallas, who came from a similar background.

After graduation Olivier resisted family pressure to train as a barrister and instead sat the competitive examination for the Civil Service. He came first, beating Sidney Webb into second place. Olivier entered the Colonial Office in the spring of 1882, working as a resident clerk. He was joined by Webb shortly afterwards, and the two became good friends. In contrast to Webb, Olivier was an impulsive and dominating dandy, nicknamed the &quot;socialist hidalgo&quot;. At this time Olivier also worked at Toynbee Hall in the East End of London, living in the slums of Whitechapel and teaching Latin at the Working Men&#x27;s College. He was a member of the Land Reform Union, where he met George Bernard Shaw in 1883, and part of team which in 1883 established a monthly periodical called the &quot;Christian Socialist&quot;, inspired by the Christian Socialist movement of 1848–1852. Olivier had become enthusiastic about Positivism after working as a tutor to the son of Henry Compton, a leading Positivist. He was attracted to the Positivist vision of a moral reform of capitalism, rather than mere amelioration, and for a while entertained this notion as an alternative to socialism that might be more palatable to Victorian England.

On 1 May 1885, Olivier and Sidney Webb followed Shaw&#x27;s lead and enrolled in the Fabian Society, which had been formed at the start of 1884; Wallas joined the following year, and the three became known as the Three Musketeers of the Society, with Shaw as their D&#x27;Artagnan. Partly through Olivier, the Fabians would adopt the policy of reforming capitalism as a necessary precursor to explicitly socialist reforms, Olivier arguing that the sudden introduction of socialism would result in either anarchy or tyranny and attacking Marxism&#x27;s neglect of non-economic values. The same month that he joined the Fabians, Olivier married Margaret Cox, the sister of Harold Cox, an old school friend and later a Liberal member of parliament. Olivier&#x27;s wife was intimidated by the Fabians, preferring the less politically involved Simple Life movement, but Olivier was an eager member of the movement, serving as the Society&#x27;s secretary from 1886 to 1890. He began speaking at the Hampstead Historic Society, a reading group for a number of Fabians, and developed his speaking skills to address larger meetings. In the summer of 1887 he took part in the Fabians&#x27; mock legislature experiment, the Charing Cross Parliament, as Colonial Secretary.

==Fabian and civil servant==

In 1888 Olivier wrote the seventh Fabian tract, &quot;Capital and Land&quot;, in which he criticised Georgism (a system, popular with some Radicals and Christian Socialists, in which land continued to be privately owned and managed but should be taxed for the benefit of the community) and instead advocated the communal ownership and control of land. That year he performed with Annie Besant clerical duties at the strike headquarters during the Bryant and May match factory strike. By now he was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of the Fabian movement in London, with Shaw, Webb and Wallas. In 1889 he wrote &quot;Moral Aspects of the Basis of Socialism&quot; in the &quot;Essays in Fabian Socialism&quot;, an attempt to develop a distinct programme for the Fabians. That year he stood down as Secretary of the Fabian Society, being succeeded by Edward R. Pease. The Oliviers bought a holiday home in Limpsfield in the North Downs; they had two daughters by now, and a third was born in November. He was a guest speaker at the London School of Economics, which had many Fabian connections.

In October 1890, having established an excellent reputation at the Colonial Office, Sydney Olivier was appointed as acting Colonial Secretary of British Honduras. He continued to be active in the Fabian Society during his periods back in London. In 1891 the Oliviers made a permanent home in Limpsfield; several other Fabians and radicals moved to the area, and they soon became the dominant force on the parish council. In 1892, Olivier and Shaw attacked Robert Blatchford, Fabian leader in Manchester, for calling for members to boycott both the Conservative and Liberal parties at the ballot, regardless of the policies of individual candidates. In 1895 he was posted to the Leeward Islands as Auditor-General, a special appointment to examine and reorganise the finances of the colony. After this he returned to London, working as Private Secretary to the Under-Secretary to the Colonial Office, Lord Selbourne. In 1897 he became Secretary to the West Indian Royal Commission, and during 1898 he went to Washington to take part in trade negotiations on behalf of the West Indian Colonies.

In the run-up to the Second Boer War, the executive of the Fabian Society became split. Some Fabians, including Olivier and Ramsay MacDonald, adhering to the traditional Liberal opposition to militarism and imperialism, opposed the war; Olivier claimed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, had engineered the conflict to increase British holdings in South Africa. Other Fabians, including Webb and Shaw, believed military action could be used to promote democracy and civilisation, whilst some also felt that the best policy was to reform the British Empire rather than, as Olivier advocated, retreating from it. The majority of the leading Fabians believed that it was a just war and that the native population would be better off under the British than under the Boers, whom many saw as religious fundamentalists and bigots. After a series of close votes, the executive came out in support of the declaration of war, although the Society would change its position during the war, as the government&#x27;s conduct came under scrutiny.

==Governor of Jamaica==
Having caused a stir in Downing Street by voicing his opposition to the war and his criticisms of Chamberlain, Olivier was posted as Colonial Secretary in Jamaica, departing in early 1900. He again enhanced his reputation as a colonial administrator, and was acting governor later in 1900 and again in 1902. This posting ended in 1903 and Olivier returned to England, but he went back to Jamaica a short while later to work in relief and rehabilitation following a devastating hurricane, and served as acting governor for a third time. He returned to England in September 1904, and spent three years as Principal Secretary to the West Africa and West Indian Department of the Colonial Office. During this time he was again active in the Fabian Society. Feeling that the society had been stagnating since 1897, he hoped that a prominent new member, H. G. Wells, would be able to re-energise it. He supported Wells&#x27; campaign for a more radical Fabian agenda in 1906, but by the end of the year he had come to find Wells too erratic.

In 1907, following a devastating earthquake in Jamaica, Olivier returned to the colony as governor. He was appointed a KCMG, making him Sir Sydney Olivier. He quickly reestablished order after the earthquake, and his reforms of the colony&#x27;s government proved to be very popular. He was responsible for the construction of the Public Buildings in downtown Kingston in which the bureaucracy and courts were housed after the earthquake. He served in this post until 1913 then returned to England permanently, though he took very little part in Fabian activities upon his return. Moving outside of the Colonial Office, he served as Permanent Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for four years, then as assistant comptroller and auditor of the Exchequer from 1917 until 1920, when he retired from the civil service to devote himself to philosophical and political study. However, this proved not to be the end of his public life.

The Sydney Olivier Interscholastic Challenge Shield is the oldest and most prestigious schoolboy football title in Jamaica. The competition started in 1909 and the Shield is played between winners of DaCosta Cup for Rural Area Champions and Manning Cup for Urban Area Champions.

==Peer and Secretary of State for India==

In January 1924 Olivier was appointed Secretary of State for India in the first Labour government and sworn of the Privy Council The following month he was raised to the peerage by Ramsay MacDonald as Baron Olivier, of Ramsden in the County of Oxford. His appointment as India Secretary dismayed those who had expected the office to go to Josiah Wedgwood, a supporter of the Indian independence movement. Under Olivier there was no departure from the Conservative policy on India, although Mahatma Gandhi was released from prison after serving only two years out of a six-year sentence. Olivier&#x27;s attitude to Empire had changed and he rejected calls for a new conference to discuss changes to the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms of 1921, reaffirming the traditional argument that Britain&#x27;s contribution to India gave it a right to be there and that the native Indians were not ready for self-government. Privately, he believed that the problems of India could not be solved at that time or by a minority Labour government, and resolved to merely defend the status quo.

In July 1924, he sided unsuccessfully with Wedgwood, Philip Snowden and J. H. Thomas in the Cabinet, opposing the promise of a loan to the Soviet Union, and was critical of MacDonald&#x27;s decision to call an unnecessary election later that year. MacDonald did not give him an office in the Labour government of 1929, instead sending him to the West Indies to investigate the sugar trade. Following this he retired for the final time, living in the Cotswolds and then Sussex. He had tried writing poetry during his early years but without any success. He wrote throughout his life, faring better with a few plays (first performed at the Fabian Society) and a Fabian paper on Émile Zola (1890), but was most noted for several books on colonial matters, including &quot;White Capital and Coloured Labour&quot; in 1906 and &quot;Jamaica, the Blessed Island&quot; in 1936. Having no sons, Olivier&#x27;s peerage became extinct upon his death in 1943. His nephew, the actor Laurence Olivier, would be granted a life peerage in 1970 as Baron Olivier, of Brighton in East Sussex.

==Family life==

Four daughters were born to the couple:
:Hon. Margery Olivier (1886–1974)
:Hon. Brynhild Olivier (20 May 1887 – 13 January 1935)
:Hon. Daphne Olivier (1889 – 14 July 1950) 
:Hon. Noël Olivier (1893–1969). 

They were prominent in the Cambridge and Bloomsbury social circles around Rupert Brooke and in what Virginia Woolf dubbed the Neo-Pagans.

Evelyn Louise Nicholson, Olivier, was his sister.

After his death, his wife Margaret edited and published his letters and other writings.

<text>Han (), or haan, is a concept of an emotion, variously described as some form of grief or resentment, among others, that is said to be an essential element of Korean identity by some, and a modern post-colonial identity by others.

The historicity of &quot;han&quot; in premodern Korea is disputed. A national culture of &quot;han&quot; did not exist in premodern Korea. The contemporary concept of &quot;han&quot;, that it is a national characteristic of the Korean people, is a modern phenomenon that originated during the Japanese occupation of Korea from Japanese colonial stereotypes and the characterization of Korean art and culture as &quot;sorrowful&quot; in Yanagi Sōetsu&#x27;s theory of the &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot;. The idea that &quot;han&quot; is a specifically Korean characteristic was adopted and popularized by Koreans in the 20th century. &quot;Han&quot; has declined significantly in South Korea but maintains popularity in the Korean American community.

== Definitions and characteristics ==
&quot;Han&quot; is derived from the Chinese character , which means resentment, hatred, or regret.

Definitions and characteristics of &quot;han&quot; are highly subjective. According to the &quot;Translation Journal&quot;, &quot;&quot;Han&quot; is frequently translated as sorrow, spite, rancor, regret, resentment or grief, among many other attempts to explain a concept that has no English equivalent.&quot; The novelist Pak Kyongni describes &quot;han&quot; as both sadness and hope. The film director Im Kwon-Taek, many of whose films deal with &quot;han&quot;, says that Koreans have different interpretations of &quot;han&quot;.

Joshua D. Pilzer defines &quot;han&quot;: &quot;A complex emotional cluster often translated as &#x27;resentful sorrow.&#x27; Thought by many to be essentially Korean, and by many others to be the product of modern, post-colonial efforts to create a &#x27;Korean&#x27; essence.&quot;

; Essentialist view
* Kim Yol-kyu defined &quot;han&quot; as &quot;the collective trauma and the memories of sufferings imposed upon [the Korean people] in the name of oppression over the course of the nation&#x27;s five thousand-odd years of history&quot;. Kim said that the meaning of &quot;han&quot; is ambiguous. Kim Yol-kyu provided examples of stories, poems, and songs in which some form of &quot;han&quot; is depicted.
* The &quot;minjung&quot; theologian Suh Nam-dong described &quot;han&quot; as &quot;a feeling of unresolved resentment against injustices suffered, a sense of helplessness because of the overwhelming odds against one, a feeling of acute pain in one&#x27;s guts and bowels, making the whole body writhe and squirm, and an obstinate urge to take revenge and to right the wrong—all these combined&quot;.
* Jon Huer describes &quot;han&quot; as a generational feeling of &quot;having been &#x27;wronged&#x27; by a superior agent&quot;, such as fate or the government; he says that the accumulated &quot;han&quot; in Korea is enormous because of a long history of suffering from invasion, poverty, and international indifference.
* According to John M. Glionna, &quot;han&quot; is &quot;intensely personal, yet carried around collectively, a national torch, a badge of suffering tempered by a sense of resiliency&quot;.

; Modern view
* Michael D. Shin describes &quot;han&quot;: &quot;In fact, it&#x27;s modern. It&#x27;s a term that captures something of the modern experience of Koreans.&quot; Shin says that defining &quot;han&quot; in terms of emotions is highly subjective; almost any negative emotion can be called &quot;han&quot;. He argues that the central aspect of &quot;han&quot; is loss of identity, and defines &quot;han&quot; as &quot;the complex of emotions that result from the traumatic loss of collective identity&quot;. &quot;Han&quot; is most commonly associated with divided families: families who were separated during the Korean War. According to Shin, all Koreans may experience &quot;han&quot;, or a &quot;constant feeling of being less than whole&quot;, because of not having a collective identity as a result of the continued division of Korea. Furthermore, new generations of Koreans seemingly inherit it because of growing up in a divided country.
* Sandra So Hee Chi Kim argues that the current usage of the word &quot;han&quot; in Korean is &quot;a postcolonial translation of a Japanese colonial construct&quot;. Similar manifestations of &quot;han&quot; exist in other Asian languages and cultures, but it has acquired ethnonationalist and essentialist tones in Korea.
* According to Joshua D. Pilzer, the idea of &quot;han&quot; as a national characteristic is recent and arises from Koreans&#x27; &quot;modern search for national essences in the wake of colonialism, and in the midst of authoritarian capitalist development and national division&quot;.
* Minsoo Kang argues that &quot;the notion that Koreans are essentially a people of &quot;han&quot; was constructed entirely in the modern era&quot;. According to Kang: &quot;The idea itself has roots in the Japanese imperial ideology that was used to justify the subjugation and exploitation of Koreans during the colonial era.&quot;

== History ==

=== Premodern Korea ===
&quot;Han&quot; is not found in the first Korean–English dictionary, published by James S. Gale in 1897, and is rarely found in classical Korean literature. According to Michael D. Shin: &quot;In actuality, classical Korean literature is full of joy and satire and humor, stuff that you don&#x27;t associate with &quot;han&quot;. &quot;Han&quot; is a very small and minor part of classical Korean literature.&quot; According to Go Misuk, &quot;han&quot; in classical Korean literature was rare but suddenly became more prominent in the early 20th century. Traditional Korean stories almost always have happy endings. According to Kim Yol-kyu, Koreans used humor as one way to relieve pent-up &quot;han&quot;, which is why &quot;han&quot; is always accompanied by humor in folk music and &quot;pansori&quot;. All surviving &quot;pansori&quot; epics have happy endings. According to Minsoo Kang, &quot;there is not a single piece of evidence that anyone prior to the 20th century thought that the word [&quot;han&quot;] held some special meaning for the Korean character&quot;. A national culture of &quot;han&quot; did not exist in Korea.

According to Michael D. Shin, a collective expression of &quot;han&quot; was observed by Western missionaries during the Great Pyongyang Revival of 1907. William Blair, a missionary, described the revival: &quot;Then began a meeting the like of which I had never seen before, nor wish to see again unless in God&#x27;s sight it is absolutely necessary. Every sin a human being can commit was publicly confessed that night.&quot; Lord William Cecil observed: &quot;[The missionary] reached only the words &quot;My Father&quot; when with a rush a power from without seemed to take hold of the meeting. The Europeans described its manifestations as terrifying. Nearly everybody present was seized with the most poignant sense of mental anguish; before each one his own sins seemed to be rising in condemnation of his life.&quot; Shin calls what they observed a very raw form of &quot;han&quot;, and argues that the &quot;awkward&quot; and &quot;terrifying&quot; way in which it was expressed suggests that a culture of &quot;han&quot; did not exist at that time. According to William Blair, it was an outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

=== Colonial Korea ===


The concept of &quot;han&quot;, as a national characteristic, originated from Yanagi Sōetsu&#x27;s theory of the &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot; () and Japanese colonial stereotypes of Korea and its people. Following the March First Movement, an independence movement that ended with the death of about 7,000 Koreans at the hands of the Japanese police and military, the Japanese art critic Yanagi Sōetsu wrote articles in 1919 and 1920, expressing sympathy for the Korean people and appreciation for Korean art. In his 1920 article, Yanagi said: &quot;The long, harsh and painful history of Korea is expressed in the hidden loneliness and sadness of their art. It always has a sad beauty and loneliness that brings you to tears. When I look at it, I can not control the emotion that fills my heart. Where else can I find such &quot;beauty of sadness&quot;.&quot;

The characterization of Korea as sad and stagnant was common in Imperial Japan; Japanese historiography of Korea was centered on the idea that Korea was stagnant. To justify the colonization of Korea, the Japanese propagated an image of Koreans as an inferior, uncivilized people, who were incapable of being independent and prone to being invaded and oppressed. The Japanese viewed Korea&#x27;s &quot;sorrow&quot; as being because of &quot;a national history of unremitting disaster&quot;. Yanagi&#x27;s views of Korea mirrored those of contemporary Japanese colonial politics. Yanagi said that Korean history was characterized by instability, invasion, and subservience; the &quot;sadness&quot; of Korean history was said to be manifested in Korean art, which, according to Yanagi, embodied the &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot;. Yanagi contributed to the naturalization of Japanese colonialism in Korea.

The last Korean emperor, Sunjong, was directly associated with &quot;han&quot;. Following his death in 1926, an article said that his &quot;life of &quot;han&quot;&quot; ended in sadness. The Dong-a Ilbo wrote: &quot;The anger, bitterness, and sorrow built up inside us have become mixed together, and it could be said that the passing of the Yunghui Emperor [Sunjong] has touched the hearts of the Joseon people and released their pent-up sadness.&quot; &quot;Han&quot; became political because Sunjong&#x27;s death symbolized the end of Korean history.

Yanagi Sōetsu was an influential figure in colonial Korea, and was accepted as a true friend by contemporary Koreans; he sought to preserve the traditional art of Korea, held fund-raising lectures and concerts for humanitarian aid, and spoke out in defense of Korean people and cultural heritage. Moderate Korean nationalists, who had a non-confrontational approach toward Japanese authority, supported Yanagi, and the Dong-a Ilbo actively promoted and sponsored him. Yanagi was admired by prominent figures in the fields of history, art, and media, who had a profound influence on the formation of modern Korean concepts of traditional art, aesthetics, and history. The concept of &quot;han&quot;, based on the &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot;, was propagated by Korean scholars and writers, continuing Yanagi&#x27;s legacy, and gradually spread to the entire education system. According to Jeong Il-seong, the passage of modern Korean history, going from the Japanese occupation to independence to national division to civil war to military dictatorship, influenced figures in art and culture to adopt the concept of &quot;han&quot;.

=== South Korea ===

Sandra So Hee Chi Kim&#x27;s article on &quot;han&quot; says that &quot;the term &quot;han&quot; itself emerged as a significant ideological concept during the 1970s&quot; and &quot;[s]ome contend that it was during the Park Chung Hee regime that the idea of &quot;han&quot; transformed from a personal sense of sorrow and resentment to a broader, national experience of unrelenting suffering and injustice&quot;. &quot;Han&quot; was used politically to promote &quot;Korean uniqueness&quot; and ethnic-national solidarity through a sense of &quot;shared suffering&quot;. &quot;Han&quot; acquired a biologistic aspect, as seen in descriptions of &quot;han&quot; by the poet Ko Un, &quot;We Koreans were born from the womb of &quot;Han&quot; and brought up in the womb of &quot;Han&quot;, and the film critic Ahn Byung-Sup, &quot;Han&quot; is an inherent characteristic of the Korean character ... It becomes part of the blood and breath of a person&quot;. Korean theologians anachronistically argued that &quot;han&quot; was a national sentiment in premodern Korea.

During the authoritarian regime of Park Chung Hee, the idea of &quot;han&quot;, and thus resentment and suffering, as a national characteristic of the Korean people may have been an ideological state apparatus to indoctrinate the working class into accepting the hardships of rapid industrialization and economic inequality; the idea of sadness being an inherent Korean trait had served a similar purpose during the Japanese occupation to naturalize the suffering of the colonized Koreans. Sunghee Choi, an art education scholar, said that her inculcation of &quot;han&quot; in education started as early as elementary school. According to Minsoo Kang, &quot;han&quot; has declined significantly since the late 1990s.

== Criticism ==
Yanagi Sōetsu&#x27;s theory of the &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot; has received criticism in both Korea and, more recently, Japan. It has been described as prejudiced, imperialistic, orientalist, sentimentalist, colonialist, and under-theorized. Yanagi&#x27;s interpretation of Korean history and art has been disputed. The &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot; was criticized by Koreans as early as 1922. In 1974, the poet Choe Harim published an influential article that established the &quot;aesthetics of colonialism&quot; and accused Yanagi&#x27;s theory of imperialism, colonialism, sentimentalism, and a &quot;superficial interpretation of Korean history&quot;. Choe criticized Yanagi&#x27;s view, that Korean art has a &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot; because Korea has long suffered at the hands of foreign countries, as being in accordance with Japanese colonial policies, which, he said, were intended to instill a sense of defeat and shame in Koreans about Korean history.

Mark Peterson disagrees with the view that Korea experienced many invasions, a view that he says is a 20th-century phenomenon that was advocated during the Japanese colonial period, and argues that Korea experienced very few invasions and had long periods of peace and stability. Peterson also disagrees with the Japanese colonial view of Korea as stagnant, inefficient, and corrupt. John Duncan calls the idea that Korea experienced constant invasions or that Korea has a &quot;history of suffering&quot; () a myth, and argues that premodern Korean history is characterized by very long periods of peace. According to David C. Kang, the dominant narrative depicting Korean history as &quot;one of almost incessant foreign incursions&quot; is a meme that emerged in the 20th century. Minsoo Kang calls the idea of a Korean character shaped by foreign invasions a modern myth that is still circulating today.

Mari Nakami says that Yanagi did not profess to be an expert or intend for his theory to be an &quot;objective observation&quot; or a &quot;scientifically approached scholarly study&quot;, but rather &quot;an expression of the human heart&quot;. Furthermore, Nakami argues that the &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot; was not the only perspective Yanagi had of Korean art: He expressed admiration and praise for Korean art, such as the Seokguram, and believed that most Japanese national art was Korean in origin or an imitation of Korean art. Yanagi gradually changed his theory of Korean art from the &quot;beauty of sorrow&quot; to the &quot;beauty of health&quot;, the &quot;beauty of naturalness&quot;, and the &quot;beauty of unity&quot;.

Despite receiving criticism for his theory, Yanagi Sōetsu has oft been praised for his humanism and preservation of traditional Korean art. In 1984, he was posthumously awarded the &quot;Bogwan&quot; Order of Cultural Merit, the first to be awarded to a non-Korean.

&quot;Han&quot; is criticized as patriarchal.

== Proverbs ==
According to Kim Yol-kyu, &quot;han&quot; is expressed in Korean proverbs about womanhood and poverty:

* Frost can fall even in May and June, if a woman harbors a grudge [&quot;han&quot;]. (A woman&#x27;s vengeance knows no bounds.)
* &quot; (as poor as a church mouse)

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Han&quot;, as a theme, is expressed in contemporary &quot;pansori&quot;. In the late 20th century, the sorrowful &quot;Western style&quot; of &quot;pansori&quot; overtook the vigorous &quot;Eastern style&quot; of &quot;pansori&quot;, and &quot;pansori&quot; began being called the &quot;sound of &quot;han&quot;&quot;. All surviving &quot;pansori&quot; epics end happily, but contemporary &quot;pansori&quot; focuses on the trials and tribulations of the characters, commonly without reaching the happy ending because of the contemporary popularity of excerpt performances. The history of &quot;pansori&quot; in the late 20th century, including the recent canonization of &quot;han&quot;, has led to great concern in the &quot;pansori&quot; community.

In American media, &quot;han&quot; has been referenced in &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot;, &quot;Koreatown, Los Angeles&quot;, and &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Han&quot;.

In the Marvel Comic Book story &quot;New York State of Mind&quot;, written by Maurene Goo, with art from Lynne Yoshi and part of &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Voices: Identity&quot; (Vol.1#1; released on August 25, 2021) Korean heroes Brawn and Silk discuss the concept of &quot;han&quot;: Silk describes her interpretation as “...its like collective grief and resentment we carry because of oppression”. While fighting the villain Scarecrow (who laments at feeling invisible because his crimes didn&#x27;t attract the attention of the Avengers), Silk and Brawn enumerate a number of indignities regularly experienced by Asian Americans. The fight concludes with Brawn delivering a knockout punch while saying: &quot;We&#x27;re Korean. We&#x27;re born angry!&quot; 

== In the Korean American community ==
Korean American scholar Elaine H. Kim has written on &quot;han&quot; in relation to the 1992 Los Angeles riots in her 1993 essay &quot;Home Is Where The Han Is&quot;.

Korean American scholar and poet Seo-Young Chu coined the term &quot;postmemory han&quot; in her 2008 essay &quot;Science Fiction and Postmemory Han in Contemporary Korean American Literature,&quot; published in MELUS. What does it mean for a second-generation Korean American to grieve for an uncle who disappeared in North Korea long before she was born? What does it mean for a second-generation Korean American to feel personally degraded by the soldiers who raped thousands of comfort women during WWII? Why should their dehumanization affect her so viscerally? How can a second-generation Korean American feel wounded by the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)—as though the wound were still raw, as though the 38th parallel cut her own body in half? Is it possible for her to feel homesick for the mountains of North Korea, an alien land where she has never been?

–Seo-Young ChuAccording to Chu&#x27;s 2008 essay, in many Korean American literary works (e.g., &quot;Dictee&quot; by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, &quot;The Language of Blood&quot; by Jane Jeong Trenka, &quot;Notes from the Divided Country&quot; by Suji Kwock Kim, and &quot;Comfort Woman&quot; by Nora Okja Keller), Americans of Korean descent are sometimes portrayed as experiencing &quot;Americanized&quot; or second-generation &quot;han&quot;. More recently, in her hybrid creative nonfiction poem &quot;I, Discomfort Woman: A Fugue in F Minor,&quot; published in 2023 in The Margins/Asian American Writers&#x27; Workshop, Chu responds to criticism of &quot;han&quot;, writing: &quot;Han I reclaim and redefine as my Korean American response to injustice&quot; and &quot;Hwabyung I reclaim and redefine as a cathartic way of experiencing political agency and creative power.&quot;

According to Minsoo Kang, South Koreans and Korean Americans have different views toward &quot;han&quot;: South Koreans attach little importance to &quot;han&quot;, viewing it as a thing of the past, while Korean Americans attach great importance to &quot;han&quot;, viewing it as a way to build an identity.

== &quot;Hwabyeong&quot; ==
According to a study from 1994, based on personal interviews, exposure to &quot;han&quot; was deemed one of the main causes of &quot;hwabyeong&quot;.

<text>Riptide is the eighth studio album by English singer Robert Palmer, released in November 4, 1985 by Island Records. The album was recorded over a period of three months in 1985 at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas. The album peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart and at No. 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified double Platinum in the US by the RIAA in March 1996 and certified Gold in the UK by BPI in August 1986. It features the songs &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Mean to Turn You On&quot;, &quot;Hyperactive&quot;, &quot;Discipline of Love&quot;, and &quot;Riptide&quot; which were all released as singles. The single &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; was accompanied by an iconic and much-imitated music video, directed by Terence Donovan, in which Palmer is surrounded by a bevy of near-identically clad, heavily made-up female &quot;musicians,&quot; either mimicking or mocking the painting style of Patrick Nagel. In September 1986, Palmer performed &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles, California. In 1987, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;. At the 1987 Brit Awards, Palmer received his first nomination for Best British Male.

Another single from &quot;Riptide&quot;, his cover of R&amp;B singer Cherrelle&#x27;s &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Mean to Turn You On&quot;, also performed well (US No. 2, UK No. 9). The song, &quot;Trick Bag,&quot; was written by one of Palmer&#x27;s major influences, New Orleans blues artist Earl King.

For the album, Palmer collaborated with two former members of his band the Power Station: guitarist Andy Taylor and drummer Tony Thompson. The Power Station&#x27;s producer Bernard Edwards also played bass and produced the album. The album also features contributions from Chaka Khan and notable session musicians such as Guy Pratt, Wally Badarou, Jeff Bova, Eddie Martinez, Dony Wynn, and Jack Waldman (who died a year after the album&#x27;s release).

The title track of the album is a cover of a 1933 song written by Walter Donaldson and Gus Kahn and first recorded by Eddy Duchin and his orchestra.

==2013 reissue==
&quot;Riptide&quot; was reissued on 30 April 2013 by Culture Factory USA, an independent label that specialises in cult artists. The reissue CD was packaged in a miniature replica of the original quality vinyl packaging complete with an inner sleeve that features the original lyrics, photographs of Palmer and credits for the album. The label side of the CD features a replica of what the original Island label looked like at the time of issue and even features &quot;grooves&quot; as if the black CD is made of vinyl.

The reissues did not have any additional outtakes or bonus tracks.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;C+&quot; and described it as &quot;his pop breakthrough&quot; and added that &quot;what makes him barely listenable is his holdings in r&amp;b.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Tim DiGravina gave the album four and a half out of five stars and wrote that &quot;&quot;Riptide&quot; packages Robert Palmer&#x27;s voice and suave personality into a commercial series of mostly rocking songs that seem custom-tailored to be chart hits.&quot;

<doc id="1103614" wikidata="Q5467181" url="?curid=1103614" title="Foral">
<text>The &quot;Carta de Foral&quot;, or simply &quot;Foral&quot;, was a royal document in Portugal and its former empire, whose purpose was to establish a &quot;concelho&quot; (Council) and regulate its administration, borders and privileges. A newly founded town would also need the king&#x27;s approval through a &quot;Foral&quot;, in order to be considered one. In this case, the town&#x27;s administration and privileges would be defined in that document. &quot;Forais&quot; were granted between the 12th and the 16th centuries.

The &quot;Foral&quot; was the basis for municipal foundation, thus the most important event of a city or town&#x27;s history. It was critical to a successful land settling and an increase in crop yields, by giving more freedom and dignity, via a concession, to farmers, in an age when people were subject to near slave work, as servants of landlords. The &quot;Foral&quot; made a &quot;concelho&quot; free from feudal control, transferring power down to a neighbours council (&quot;concelho&quot;), with its own municipal autonomy. As a result, the population would become directly and exclusively under the dominion and jurisdiction of the crown, excluding the Lord from the power hierarchy. The &quot;Foral&quot; granted public lands to the collective use of the community, regulated taxes, tolls and fines and established protection rights and military duties within royal service.

A pillory (&quot;pelourinho&quot;) is directly linked to a &quot;Foral&quot;. It was raised after the &quot;Foral&quot; was granted and placed in the main square of the town.

The noun &quot;foral&quot; (, plural: &quot;forais&quot;) is derived from the Portuguese word &quot;foro&quot;, ultimately from Latin &quot;forum&quot;, and is cognate with Spanish &quot;fuero&quot;, Galician &quot;foro&quot;, Catalan &quot;fur&quot; and Basque &quot;foru&quot;.</text><links>

<text>St Helens () is a town in Merseyside, England, with a population of 183,200. It is the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, It the second most populous town in the Liverpool City Region.

The town is north of the River Mersey, in the south-west part of historic Lancashire. The town was initially a small settlement within the historic county&#x27;s ancient &quot;hundred&quot; of West Derby in the township of Windle but by the mid-1700s the town had developed into a larger urban area beyond the townships borders. By 1838 the council was formally made responsible for the administration of Windle and the three other townships of Eccleston, Parr and Sutton that were to form the town&#x27;s traditional shape. In 1868 the town was incorporated as a municipal borough, then later became a county borough in 1887. In 1974 the town was made a metropolitan borough within the new Metropolitan County of Merseyside by the Local Government Act 1972, with an expanded administrative responsibility for several nearby towns and villages.

The town was famous for its heavy industry, particularly its role in the coal mining industry, glassmaking, chemicals and copper smelting and sail making that drove its growth throughout the Industrial Revolution. Originally home to a large number of industrial employers such as Beechams, the Gamble Alkali Works, Ravenhead Glass, United Glass Bottles (UGB), Triplex, Daglish Foundry, Greenall&#x27;s brewery, the glass producer Pilkington is the town&#x27;s only remaining large industrial employer.

The town is today most famous for its Rugby League team St Helens R.F.C. who have won 3 World Club Challenge cups in recent years, and museums such as the North West Museum of Road Transport, the World of Glass and art installations such as Dream.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The southern part of what became the traditional county of Lancashire was at least partially settled by the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe, who were subjugated by the Romans during their 1st Century conquest, with nearby Wigan suggested as a location for the Roman settlement of Coccium. Eccleston in St Helens appears to derive its name from either the Latin &quot;ecclesia&quot; or the Brittonic &quot;eglwys&quot;, both meaning &quot;church&quot;, suggesting a common link to a place of worship although none is known in that township until the 19th century.

The first recorded settlements are the Manors, Parishes and Titled Lands listed in the Domesday Book in the 11th century. The titled lands would have encompassed the modern townships of Sutton, Windle and Parr as part of their fiefdoms, though it may be inferred from the listed tithes that the land was populated before then.

===Formation===


St Helens did not exist as a town in its own right until as late as the middle of the 18th century when it is referenced in Parliament. The development of the town has a complex history: it was spurred on by the rapid population growth in the region during the Industrial Revolution. Between 1629 and 1839, St Helens grew from a small collection of houses surrounding an old chapel, to a village, before becoming the significant urban centre of the four primary manors and surrounding townships that make up the modern town.

The Domesday Book of 1086 reveals that several manors existed at that time, although there are no specific references to &quot;St Elyn&quot;, or mentions of the particular &quot;vill&quot; or villages. Windle is first recorded on some maps as &quot;Windhull&quot; (or variations thereof) in 1201, Bold in 1212 (as Bolde) and Parr (or Parre) in 1246, whilst Sutton and Ecclestone composed part of the Widnes &quot;fee&quot; (a hereditary entitlement of ownership) under a Knight or Earl. It is known that the Hospitallers held lands in the area of Hardshaw as early as 1292, known as Crossgate (which may be referred to by the long built-over Cross Street in the town centre beneath the modern College campus) and many of the original parishes, townships and local areas are named after the families that owned the land between the 11th and 18th centuries.

The Ecclestone family owned the Eccleston township. Their ancestral home dates to 1100; it was built by Hugh Ecclestone. The family is referred to throughout the period until the 18th century when they departed for nearby Southport.

The manor of Parr remained in control of the Parr family and their descendants from the 13th to the early 15th century when a distant relative of the original family line, William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton (brother of Henry VIII&#x27;s wife Catherine Parr) sold the manor to the Byroms of Lowton. The family later supported the Royalists during the English Civil War, and Henry Byrom (son of the Lord of the Manor) died at the Battle of Edgehill.

The extensive lands of Sutton Manor stretched across the open and flat land leading towards the Mersey. The manor&#x27;s name is of unknown origin, but the land within the estate referred to several leading families, including Eltonhead, Ravenhead, and Sherdley. In 1212, William de Daresbury was the title holder of the manors. The Sherdley family can be traced back to the Northales, who had been settled in the area since at least 1276 when they were referred to as plaintiffs in a boundary dispute with the Lords of Rainhill.

Windle contained the smaller Hardshaw, described as a in the Domesday Book. It was in Hardshaw that Chapel Lane was constructed. The Windle Family were Lords of the Manor and Township from the Norman period onward before ceding control to the Gerards of Bryn.

In 1139, the earldom of Derby, in the Peerage of England, was created: Norman descendant Robert De Ferrers was the first Earl. Subsequently, the region passed to John of Gaunt, and eventually the Stanley family. Their ancestral home was eventually established in the nearby Knowsley area (to the west of the modern St Helens borough), with the foundation of a hunting lodge in the 15th century and subsequently Knowsley Hall in the 18th century. The Earl of Derby&#x27;s lands encompassed a region from Liverpool to Manchester, and to the north beyond Lancaster and were primarily turned to meeting the pastoral needs of the people.

Throughout this period, the area was predominantly arable land and was noted for its large swathes of moss, heath and bog land while elsewhere in parts, it was covered by the greater Mersey Forest (the larger &quot;Community Forest&quot; was not established until much later).

The origin of the name &quot;St Helens&quot; stretches back at least to a chapel of ease dedicated to St Elyn, the earliest documented reference to which is in 1552. The first time the chapel was formally referred to appears to be 1558, when Thomas Parr of Parr bequeathed a sum of money &quot;to a stock towards finding a priest at St. Helen&#x27;s Chapel in Hardshaw, and to the maintenance of God&#x27;s divine service there for ever, if the stock go forward and that the priest do service as is aforesaid&quot;. Early maps show that it was originally in Chapel Lane, near the site of the modern pedestrianised Church Street. Historically this would have fallen within the of Hardshaw, within the greater township of Windle (making up the southern border) abutting onto the open farmland of Parr to the east, and Sutton and Eccleston to the south and west respectively.

In 1552, the Chapel of St Elyn was noted as &quot;consisting only of a challis and a lytle bell&quot;. The chapel was described as being at the crux of the four townships of Eccleston, Parr, Sutton and Windle, and lay on the intersecting roads that criss-crossed the area and linked Lancashire towns such as Liverpool, Ormskirk, Lathom and the Cheshire region south of the River Mersey. The transport link is attested to by the existence of Chester Lane (the modern B5419 is much foreshortened) that originally wound through the west of the town heading south to the Mersey crossing point of Warrington and beyond to the ancient Chester Road (that now makes up part of the modern A56) that stretched between the historic town of its name and the Manchester townships. The chapel also sat directly between the port town of Liverpool, and the landlocked Manchester townships that would become important in the development of the greater area of both St Helens and Wigan.

As a busy thoroughfare it is suggested by historian and genealogist William Farrer that a village existed in the vicinity for centuries, later sharing the name of the chapel. It is known from the diaries of a local Puritan by the name of Adam Martindale that by the time the King&#x27;s Head Inn was constructed in 1629 on &quot;the great road&quot; (taken to refer to all or part of Chester Lane) between Warrington and Ormskirk, a number of houses, farms and manors counted amongst the properties in the local vicinity and general area. Martindale notes that by 1618 that the original chapel had been demolished and rebuilt in the same vicinity. In 1678 a building was converted for use as a meeting place for the Society of Friends by George Shaw of Bickerstaffe. Local historians believe the building had been used for another purpose long before 1678. The Quaker Friends&#x27; Meeting House, as it is now known, is a Grade II listed building.

The strong link to Roman Catholicism in the area was maintained throughout this period by the eventual Lords of Sutton Manor, the De Holland family, starting in 1321. Thomas Holland, a local Jesuit priest, was arrested and tried for high treason in October 1642 as &quot;taking orders by authority of the see of Rome and returning to England&quot;. The first step toward his beatification was allowed by Pope Leo XIII in 1886. Conversely Roger Holland was burnt at the stake for heresy when he continued his professed belief in the Reformed churches some 100 years earlier in 1558 during the persecution of Mary I. It is suggested that Ravenhead Hall was the site of a Catholic chapel during the most severe of Catholic persecutions during the 17th and 18th centuries. Whilst the Lathom family maintained Rainfords close connections, as did the Ecclestons.

Less well-known is the Windle connection to witches. In 1602, two women were sent to Lancaster for trial, while a decade later Isobel Roby was submitted to Sir Thomas Gerard, accused of upsetting the ship upon which James VI and I&#x27;s Queen Consort Anne of Denmark was arriving. Roby was finally executed at Lancaster, along with the Pendle and Salmesburg witches, on 20 August 1612.

By 1746, St Helens, composed of the greater area of the four townships (and their collieries) beyond Prescot, was referred to in a statement in Parliament related to the extension of the Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike.

The rapid growth of St Helens at the centre of the townships is attested to by several authors. The &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot; states in 1839 that &quot;Saint Helen&#x27;s, Lancashire, is in the township of Windle, in the chapelry of St Helen&#x27;s, Prescott parish. The township contains , and had in 1831 a population of 5,825. The town has risen into importance of late years&quot; In contrast by 1844 (30 years before the borough of St Helens was established) Cyrus Redding mentions a reversal of the roles: &quot;St Helens, originally an inconsiderable village, is now a very thriving town&quot;; and he later states that the town &quot;... may be said to contain the four townships of Sutton, Parr, Windle and Eccleston&quot;. The composition of the town described by Redding largely mirrors those observations made by Samuel Lewis in 1848 and later still in 1874 by John Marius Wilson and John Bartholemew in 1887.

Census figures from 1801 suggest the population of the District Area of St Helens to be 12,500; by 1861 it was between 37,631 and 55,523 (John Marius Wilson gives the lower number, with total households at the specific figure of 6,539) in the wider area with St Helens itself comprising a population of 20,176 in 3,577 households. The Ordnance Survey map of 1843 shows St Helens as the significant urban centre

The original Town Hall was constructed in 1839 and described by Wilson in 1874 as &quot;in the Italian style, with a Corinthian portico; and contains a lock-up, a newsroom, and a large hall for courts, concerts, balls, and public meetings&quot;. It was not until 1852 that the Civil Parish of St Helens was instituted (noted in 1874 by Wilson as &quot;more extensive than the town&quot;). The Mill Street Barracks were completed in 1861.

On 2 February 1868, Queen Victoria granted a Charter of Incorporation, defining St Helens officially as a Municipal Borough. The first election of Councillors took place on 9 May the same year, followed by the first Town Council meeting on 18 May. About 20 years later in 1887 St Helens became a County Borough, with two Members of Parliament.

In 1894, the Parish of St Helens was incorporated under the 1893 St Helens Corporation Act. This was achieved by the abolition of the Civil Parishes of Parr, Sutton and amalgamation of their townships. The Civil Parishes of Eccleston and Windle both ceded portions of their areas over to St Helens.

The modern Borough of St Helens includes areas historically not associated with the town. The 1974 creation of the Ceremonial County of Merseyside appended the former urban districts of Haydock, Newton-le-Willows and Rainford, and parts of Billinge-and-Winstanley and Ashton-in-Makerfield urban districts, along with part of Whiston Rural District, all from the administrative county of Lancashire. The urban sprawl of St Helens was already extended up to the boundary lines of places such as Haydock and Rainhill, where inhabitants may consider themselves either part of either both St Helens the &#x27;Town&#x27; or &#x27;Borough&#x27;, or just the Borough.

===Industrial development===
Until the mid-18th century, the local industry was almost entirely based on small-scale home-based initiatives such as linen weaving. The landscape was dotted with similarly small-scale excavation and mining operations, primarily for clay and peat, but also notably for coal. It is the coal to which the town owes both its initial growth and development and the subsequent development of the coal-dependent industries of copper smelting and glass.

Sitting on the South Lancashire Coalfield, the town was built both physically and metaphorically on coal; the original motto in the borough council&#x27;s coat of arms was &quot;Ex Terra Lucem&quot; (&quot;From the Ground, Light&quot;) and local collieries employed up to 5,000 men as late as the 1970s. During the boom years of the British coal industry (1913 was the peak year of production, with 1 million employed in UK mining industry) the St Helens division of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&#x27; Federation (the local miners&#x27; union) had the largest membership (10%) of that federation.

The discovery of winnable coal seams is mentioned in 1556, referred to as &quot;Beds of cinders or coke ... have been discovered three feet thick&quot; during the digging of a clay pit and is commonly attributed to the Eltonhead family (Elton Head Road, the modern B5204, shares the name of the family) whilst reference to the significant distribution of &quot;potsherds&quot; during excavation suggests that some light industry had been underway for some time before (perhaps as far back as the 13th century) and the clay and pottery industries lasted in the area through to the early 20th century. A dispute arose between the landlord Bolds and the tenant Eltonheads, eventually resulting in an agreement to compensate the Bold family.

The majority of the land had been turned over to arable farming since at least the 12th century, according to the historical family records of William De Daresbury. The township of Sutton was recorded as &quot;by itself being assessed at four plough-lands&quot;. Plow or ploughlands are assessed at apiece. The pastoral use of the local land was common even in 1901, with William Farrer noting of Eccleston that the &quot;country is of an undulating nature and principally dedicated to agriculture, fields of rich and fertile soil being predominant&quot; and describing the produce as &quot;chiefly potatoes, oats, and wheat on a clayey soil which alternates with peat&quot;. Even so, Farrer also notes that several old quarries and shafts still existed within the area while also making reference to a &quot;brewery at Portico, and a pottery near Prescot, while glass, watchmakers&#x27; tools, and mineral waters are also manufactured&quot;.

Two hundred years earlier, Farrer may well have seen a different sight: St Helens was scarred and pitted by shallow mining operations, often quickly abandoned, left to flood and exceedingly prone to collapse. The primitive mining techniques, and limited ability to bail out gathering water, meant many pits had short lifespans. Complaints are recorded in Sutton Heath in particular about the plans to expand mining across the town, but the lure of a stable income ultimately won out against the objections. 100 years later, the Council rejected a planning application for an open cast mine — underlining the finality of the decline of coal mining in the area.

In the 18th century, however, coal was an enabling force for the town that opened up opportunities for further commercial and industrial developments, which in turn drove demand for the rapid movement of raw goods not simply out of the town (coal to Liverpool to fuel its shipping and steel works for instance, but also its salt works) but also in promoting an influx of raw products for processing. The dependence of St Helens on its transport links is evident from claims made to Parliament in 1746 for maintenance and extension of the turnpike road after local flooding had damaged it.

It is clear that St Helens&#x27; development owes as much to its location on the south Lancashire Coalfield as it does the fact that Liverpool, Chester and other centres of industry were not, and yearned for the fossil fuel of choice.

It was essential therefore for the town to maintain, and invest further in, transport links and promote itself as a hub for the growth of Liverpool, with its provision of raw materials benefiting from its location and promising transport links. Liverpool, recognising the need for a ready supply of coal for its forges, responded with a petition for the extension of the Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike. This soon developed into a far more forward thinking development which was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution: canals.

It was originally proposed merely to make the Sankey Brook navigable, but the eventual outcome was a complete man-made canal linking St Helens to the River Mersey and the city of Liverpool. The Sankey Canal was opened in 1757, and extended in 1775, to transport coal from the pits in Ravenhead, Haydock and Parr to Liverpool, and for raw materials to be shipped to St Helens.

The transport revolution centred on the region encouraged an influx of industry to the hitherto sparsely populated area. With industry came job opportunities and population growth. Between 1700 St Helens grew from a sparsely populated array of manor houses and their tenants into a sprawling span of mining operations.

Owing primarily to the abundance of coal reserves, the quality of local sand, and the availability of salt in nearby Cheshire, glass making is known to have been ongoing in the Sutton area since at least 1688, when the Frenchman John Leaf Snr is recorded as paying the Eltonhead family £50 for a lease of 2½ acres (1 hectare) of Sutton&#x27;s Lower Hey. The glass industry got a significant lift with the Crown-authorised &quot;British Cast Plate Glass Company&quot; established in Ravenhead in 1786; it latched onto the success of similar enterprises to set the region as the market leader for glass.

The foundation of the companies owed as much to industrial leaders from outside the town (and the finance they provided) as to its natural resources but the synchronous development of the steam engine was a significant development, with James Watt&#x27;s stationary steam engine design leading the way. Water could be pumped from deeper than ever before, and mines could be driven to find even more dense seams. At the same time, the growth in use of machinery (e.g. for mills, forges, and ships) rapidly increased the demand for coal - to which the town responded.

Land exchanged hands in St Helens rapidly, as established families moved out of the growing towns filled with the working classes to more gentrified and less industrially developed places. In their place came self-made wealthy industrialists such as John Mackay (who first leased land in St Helens in the 1760s from King George III before buying the land constituting Ravenhead Farm from the Archbishop of York), Michael Hughes, the Gambles, and later Thomas Beecham, Thomas Greenall and the Pilkingtons. A few established families remained, such as the Gerards of Windle Hall. They made their land available for industrial use.

One of the first major industries to grow out of the transport innovations in the region was copper smelting. The Parys mining company, led by Michael Hughes, leased land from John Mackay close to the newly constructed Sankey Canal at Ravenhead (where Ravenhead Colliery had since been established). This allowed copper ore carried from the Parys Mountain mine in Amlwch in Anglesey, North Wales to arrive in the St Helens region via the Mersey directly at the point where coal was being excavated to fire the forges of industry. Some 10,000 tons of copper ore yielding over 1,300 tons of copper passed along this route. At the same time the Gerards were renting out land in Blackbrook to Patten &amp; Co. from nearby Warrington. The company smelted using the Gerards &#x27;own coal, then moved the coal downstream from a private wharf on the navigable brook.

The boom did not last: by 1783, coal industry leaders such as Mackay, Sarah Clayton and Thomas Case were all dead, penniless or both as a global constriction on coal shipments stifled the industry. An over-reliance on shipping to the USA during the American War of Independence (1775–1783) ruined many people, and led to the permanent loss of several smaller industries. It took partnership and coordination with other industries for the mining industry to recover; with the US embargo lifted, the town&#x27;s troubles were soon overcome if not forgotten, although this was not the last troubling incident.

The demand for chemicals such as alkali from the glass industry soon led the Gamble family to start their lime and alkali pits, saving on import costs. The growing demand for chemical processing also contributed heavily to the growth of Widnes.

The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened in 1830. It passed through the southern edge of the town at Rainhill and St Helens Junction, and furthered its economic development as a centre of industry.

===The decline of the mining industry===
The last coal mine located close to the town centre (Ravenhead Colliery) and those located in the outlying districts of St Helens, including those that were just outside the original 1887 County Borough boundary, such as Clock Face (Clock Face Colliery), Sutton (Bold Colliery), Sutton Heath (Lea Green Colliery), Sutton Manor (Sutton Manor Colliery) and Haydock (Lyme Pit, Wood Pit, Old Boston), were all closed between the nationalisation of the deep coal mining industry in 1947 and 24 May 1991, when Sutton Manor Colliery, the last to go in the immediate St Helens area, finally closed its gates.

The coal mining industry in St Helens and elsewhere had collapsed because the government maintained that the deep mining of coal was no longer an economically viable proposition in most British coalfields. The closures were opposed by the National Union of Mineworkers during the year-long Miners&#x27; Strike of 1984–85. After the collapse of the miners&#x27; strike in March 1985, St Helens was just one of dozens of towns in the UK that was immediately set to lose a long-standing employer. In the case of both Sutton Manor and Bold Collieries, it was estimated by some that when they were closed they each still had up to 40 years of winnable coal reserves. The last colliery in the modern metropolitan borough, and in the St Helens area of the South Lancashire Coalfield, was Parkside, in Newton-le-Willows, which was closed in 1993.

==Economy==

The glass industry is no longer the major employer it once was; however, it still employs over a thousand people in the town. The large Pilkington Brothers works, founded in 1826, dominates the town&#x27;s industrial quarter and still produces all the UK&#x27;s output of flat glass.

In 1994, planning permission was sought out for a link road connecting the M62 directly with the town centre. The development included a £5m retail and commercial property project in the Ravenhead area that had seen successive business closures with the folding of UGB and Ravenhead Glass.

===Retail===

The town&#x27;s shopping area is centred on the parish church of St Helens, the original site of St Mary&#x27;s open market. The open market was later replaced by an awned covered market that populated Chapel Lane and the locale.

The current Church Square shopping centre surrounds St Helens on three sides. Church Street, the main high street, runs parallel to Church Square and is sandwiched by the town&#x27;s second shopping centre known as The Hardshaw Centre. The other main shopping streets in the town centre include the more traditional small store based Bridge Street, Duke Street and Westfield Street populated by independent specialists. Church Square was bought by St Helens Borough Council in 2017 for £26.6m as part of local regeneration plans.

The town centre has several supermarkets including mainstream stores such as Asda and Tesco, as well as smaller stores such as Lidl. Morrisons retain two stores located in the Eccleston and Sutton areas of the town. There is also a Tesco superstore in Earlestown, which is on a former Safeway site and many smaller Tesco Express and Tesco Metro stores. A new Tesco Extra store opened in October 2011 on the outskirts of the town centre to replace the existing Chalon Way superstore, which has now been taken over by new retail Home &amp; Leisure outlet, The Range.

St Helens has two major retail parks, one on either side of the St Helens Linkway. The older of these, St Helens Retail Park, is home to several discount stores and wholesale retailers.

The larger Ravenhead Retail Park houses more large-scale mainstream retail stores, and a number of restaurants, fast food outlets and cafes. The same area (in particular the old United Glass Bottles site) has been used for development of the new St Helens RLFC stadium and the construction of a Tesco Extra supermarket, to replace the smaller Tesco supermarket in the town centre. At 140,000 square metres, this Tesco Extra store is one of the biggest in England

Major investment is transforming former industrial land for use as hotels, shopping areas and housing after an initial landscape grading and character assessment project was concluded in late 2005 by Land Use Consultants on behalf of St Helens Borough Council.

===Urban regeneration projects===
Since the millennium St Helens has become a focus for a whole borough scheme of Urban Regeneration initiatives in coordination with local Housing Authorities, Business and Art Projects in addition to European, Regional and Central Government funding such as the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, the North West Regional Development Agency and The Mersey Partnership as part of the European Regional Development Fund

The whole project is coordinated by St Helens Borough Council under their umbrella corporate branding &quot;St Helens; The Heart of the North West&quot; with an emphasis on promoting the location of the town as a vital hub of the region, to encourage investment and the development of business links.

In 2007, the Brand New St Helens project was launched and published their Development Review Document. The report set out the achievements in the years since the millennium and set out the future development projects for the town including the wholly rebuilt College Campus, and Cowley Language College (formerly Cowley High). The document also lays out retail, leisure and tourism developments for the Town.

In 2009, a Multi Area Agreement (MAA) was made with the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens agreeing to form part of the Liverpool City Region, a cross boundary cooperation of 5 adjoining authorities in Merseyside and the Halton Borough on strategic policy areas such as economic growth, transport, tourism, culture, housing, and physical infrastructure.

Local Projects such as &quot;Re:new St Helens&quot; operated in conjunction with Helena Housing was originally set up in 2006 in an effort to initially &quot;make the Parr area of St Helens a better place to live, work and be part of&quot;. The scheme&#x27;s success led to it being expanded to other identified areas in need of redevelopment including Four Acre (in Clock Face), Thatto Heath and the North of the Town Centre.

The Re:new projects coordinate a Partnership Board to meet the needs of local residents in conjunction with local service providers such as the council, Local Education Authority, Local Healthcare, Housing Associations and the Police to help improve services, identify local priorities and make changes with an aim to tackle &quot;the quality of life issues which matter most to local people&quot;. The scheme has been responsible for the redevelopment of The Duckeries and Gaskell Park in Parr that both achieved Green Flag status in 2008

===Historic and notable buildings===

St Helens Town Hall built in 1876 to replace the original (damaged by a fire in 1871); its clock tower originally had a steeple but this was destroyed in a fire in 1913.

In the centre of the modern town centre, adjacent to the town hall, is the Gamble Institute, built in 1896 and named after Sir David Gamble, who was the first mayor and who also gifted the land for the building. Today, the Gamble Institute building serves as the central library and also houses other municipal offices and archives.

Other buildings of note are:

The Friends&#x27; Meeting House, Church Street. This attractive stone-built Grade II listed hall has been used for Quaker worship for over 300 years since its establishment, in 1678, by George Shaw of Bickerstaffe. A sign at the front of the building reads &quot;so used&quot; since 1678, partly leading local historians to believe the building had been used for another purpose for quite a number of years before 1678. The building and garden have been recently restored and are an important element of the George Street Conservation Area. The sundial over the door of the meeting house is dated 1753, while a curiosity in the garden is a huge glacial boulder, said to have been deposited from the Lake District following the last ice age.

The Beecham Clock Tower, Westfield Street - which is now part of St Helens College. This was the original headquarters of the Beecham pharmaceutical empire.

St Mary&#x27;s Lowe House Catholic Church, North Road is a Grade II listed building, opened in 1929, the second on this site (the land having been donated by Winifred Gorsuch Lowe - hence the name &#x27;Lowe House&#x27;). The church is an unusual and striking landmark with a tower and a dome of a mixed Romanesque and Gothic style. The major feature is the historic Carillon (bells playable using a keyboard, rather than by pulling ropes). It is the largest in the North West of England, housing 47 bells.

The Roman Catholic Church of St Anne and Blessed Dominic, Monastery Road, Sutton, is a pilgrimage site for Roman Catholics. The Victorian missionary Blessed Dominic Barberi is buried in the church. Alongside Blessed Dominic, Father Ignatius Spencer is buried. The son of the 2nd Earl Spencer, he was a famed convert to the Roman Catholic faith. Elizabeth Prout, foundress of the religious order, the Sisters of the Cross and Passion, is also buried with them.

==Geography==
The St Helens Borough covers roughly of soft rolling hills used primarily for agricultural purposes, mainly arable. The highest point in the borough, and in the whole of Merseyside, is Billinge Hill, north of the town centre. From the top of this hill the cities of Manchester and Liverpool are visible on a clear day, as well as the towns of Wigan, Bolton and Warrington. The Mill Brook/Windle Brook runs through Eccleston and connects with the disused St Helens branch/section of the Sankey Canal in the town centre. St Helens is around above sea level.

Carr Mill Dam is Merseyside&#x27;s largest body of inland water, with lakeside trails and walks. It is used for national competitive powerboating and angling events.

Moss Bank, a suburb of St Helens, is about north of the town centre. It has a community library and St David&#x27;s
church.
The Burgies are two tailings on the site of the old Rushy Park coal mine. They were created by dumping toxic chemical waste from the manufacture of glass; they have since been covered with tall grass and woodland.

St Helens was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. Damage from the tornado occurred in St Helens town centre.

===Location===
St Helens is located to the east of Liverpool and from the centre of Manchester. The borough shares borders with the towns or boroughs of Prescot in Knowsley, Skelmersdale, Warrington, Widnes and Wigan; it has direct transport links by road and two main railway lines. Its centralised location has formed the basis of the local authority&#x27;s promotional literature.

The town is considered part of the Liverpool Urban Area for ONS purposes.

==Transport==
===Road===
St Helens is well served by motorway links with the east–west corridors of the M58 and M62 to the north and south of the town. The town is also served by the parallel-running north–south routes of the M57 and M6 to the east and west.

The M6 runs a few miles to the eastern side of the town centre, with J23 at Haydock serving both northbound and southbound traffic and J24 at Ashton in Makerfield serving southbound exit and northbound access.

The M62 runs a couple of miles to the south of the town with J7 at Rainhill Stoops. The M57&#x27;s J2 lies several miles south-west of St. Helens, at Prescot. The M58 is several miles north, at the north-western end of the A570 Rainford by-pass dual carriageway.

The A580 &quot;East Lancashire Road&quot; runs north of the town centre alongside Eccleston, Moss Bank and through Haydock. It is a dual-carriageway former trunk road taking traffic from Manchester to the Liverpool Docks. It was built between 1929 and 1934 and was opened by King George V. It was intended to take pressure away from the A58, a major road running from Prescot (M57) through St Helens to the A1(M) at Wetherby, West Yorkshire.

The Rainford by-pass is a section of the A570, between the East Lancashire Road and the M58; it is part of the transport route from Southport, in Sefton, through west Lancashire and St Helens to the M62 J7 at Rainhill.

A major development in communication was the opening of the dual-carriageway &quot;St Helens Linkway&quot; (classified as part of the A570) in 1994, which linked the town centre directly with the M62 (at Rainhill). The A572 takes traffic from the town centre through Parr to Earlestown and Newton-le-Willows. In July 2020, the St Helens Linkway grass verge was chosen by St Helens Borough Council as a site on which to plant yellow flowers in a large heart shape, in memory of all who had died during the coronavirus pandemic.

In 2010, St Helens was proclaimed &quot;UK&#x27;s most car-friendly town&quot; measured on variables such as &quot;petrol prices, parking costs and the number of speed cameras in an assessment carried out by Virgin Money Car Insurance&quot; in research conducted by &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper.

===Buses===

Bus services to Wigan (320, 352), Liverpool, Widnes and Warrington operate from the town centre. St Helens has a central bus station that sits between Bickerstaffe Street and Corporation Street. A Merseytravel office is located on Bickerstaffe Street, where bus passes and advice can be sought.

From 1890, St Helens Corporation Transport organised public network services throughout the area, providing bus and trolleybus services. Following local government re-organisation in 1974, the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (Merseytravel) was expanded to cover St Helens. After privatisation in 1986, the town was served by several locally branded operations under the umbrella of Merseyside Transport Limited (MTL), in which Merseytravel retained shares until 1993.

Arriva purchased MTL in 2000 and has operated the majority of the routes since. Several smaller operators run specific routes within the town area, such as Cumfybus, Hattons, HTL Buses, Red Kite Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire and local municipal bus companies. There were also three zero-fare services operated by battery-electric minibuses in and around the town centre, ferrying passengers to nearby retail parks such as Ravenhead, which were provided on behalf of Merseytravel by Selwyns Travel. From 22 February 2014, these buses were withdrawn from service as part of a Merseytravel programme of spending cuts and due to the buses being at end of their operational lives.

===Railway===
St Helens Central station serves the town centre. The stations of Thatto Heath, Eccleston Park and Garswood are on the Liverpool to Wigan Line that runs from Liverpool Lime Street to Wigan North Western.

The Liverpool to Manchester line serves the St Helens area at Rainhill, Lea Green and St Helens Junction before passing on to Earlestown and Newton-le-Willows. The St Helens Junction and Rainhill buildings are two of the original stations that were built when the line opened in 1830.

Until the 1950s, three railway lines ran through St Helens:

* the current line from Liverpool Lime Street, through Huyton and St Helens, to Wigan North Western;
* a line from Widnes, through St Helens, to Rainford;
* a line starting at St Helens, running east through Haydock, to on the LNER Wigan Junction line.

A major redevelopment of St Helens Central station was completed in 2007 at a cost of £6.2 million, which the council hoped would encourage investment, create more jobs and improve the gateway into the town. The building has been constructed using copper on the fins, in reference to the town&#x27;s early industrial heritage.

In 2010, it was confirmed by the government that electrification both of the Liverpool to Manchester and Liverpool to Wigan lines would be implemented, with national body Network Rail announcing a projected overall completion date of 2014. Electrification work was eventually completed in 2015 and Northern Rail, the train operating company, announced the introduction of electric services on the line from the commencement of the new timetable changeover on 17 May 2015. The Liverpool to Wigan service was operated by 4-car Class 319 electric units from 2015 to 2023. The service is now operated by 3 and 4 car CAF Civity Class 331 units.

St Helens Borough Council has discussed the possibility of a new railway station at Carr Mill in Laffak.

===Waterways===
St Helens is a landlocked town, but it has easy access to the ports of Liverpool, on the River Mersey and Mostyn, and north Wales on the River Dee. The Sankey Canal, including the St Helens section, is no longer used for transporting goods; it consists of several short sections only, with the remainder being drained and filled.

===Air===
The nearest airport is Liverpool John Lennon Airport, located about south-west of the town and is connected by a frequent service from St Helens bus station (the 89 service). By road, it is accessed via the St Helens Linkway to M62 westbound J7 at Rainhill. There is no direct rail connection at present, although some trains calling at St Helens Central now go to Liverpool South Parkway station, which has shuttle buses connecting with the airport.

Manchester Airport is approximately away. By road, it is accessed via the St Helens Linkway to M62 eastbound J7 at Rainhill and by rail; the Manchester Airport train service serves St Helens Junction station.

===Past links===

An extensive tram and trolleybus system operated between 1880 and 1936. Trolleybus services commenced in 1927 and ceased 30 June 1958, when the last Prescot Circle trolleybus was replaced by a bus service. From 1919, the service was operated by the St Helens Corporation Tramways; prior to this, it had been operated by the St Helens and District Tramways Company and subsequently the New St Helens and District Tramways Company. Originally horse drawn, they became steam powered by 1890 and then electric by 1899. The original lines were all removed during the war for steel for the war effort. The only tram tracks left can be seen in the Transport Museum and one isolated trolleybus pole that carried the power lines can still be seen in Warrington Road, Peasley Cross.

A tram link also existed, to Windle and in Haydock, the latter serving Liverpool via Knotty Ash.

==Governance==
===Civic history===
St Helens first became responsible for the administration of the wider area in 1836 when made a Registration sub-district of the Prescot Parish as part of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 that devolved control down to the more localised Parish control (spurred on by the Reform Act 1832).

St Helens, in Hardshaw of Windle, constructed its original Town Hall in 1839 that served as a legal court, meeting house, and administrative centre. It also held Council meetings for Aldermen and Parishioners alike.

In 1868, St Helens was incorporated as a borough (covering the 4 Townships). In response to the old, smaller, hall suffering fire damage in 1872 a new hall was planned. This current town hall was built between 1872 and 1876. In 1889 St Helens was again reformed, this time as a county borough with greater responsibility over an increased area of land. This was part of an ongoing process of local government restructure during the Victorian era, this time as part of the Municipal Corporations Act 1882.

As a county borough, St Helens was, from 1889 to 1974, inside the administrative county of Lancashire. On 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, St Helens became the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens in the newly created Merseyside Metropolitan county. At this time St Helens Borough Council replaced all the local Councils within the prescribed area.

===Historic coat of arms===
The old Town and Borough Council coat of arms were granted on 17 January 1876. The coat of arms is an Argent (white or silver) Field common to earlier coat of arms in the area. The black cross is referenced from the family of the Ecclestons. The saltires in the first and fourth quarters are from the arms of the Gerards of Windleshaw. The &quot;second and third a griffon segreant&quot; meanwhile are taken from the Bold family. The blue bars are from the arms of the Parr family, Marquises of Northampton. The lion is from the crest of the Walmsleys and the two fleurs-de-lys refer to Sir David Gamble, first Mayor and benefactor of the town, and the Haydock family.

As the council ceased to exist in 1974, these arms are since then no longer in use. The coat of arms of the present council of Metropolitan Borough of St Helens has taken over part of its design.

===Motto===
The motto was the Latin &quot;Ex Terra Lucem&quot;. A literal translation would be &quot;From the Ground, Light&quot; whilst more descriptive translations might be &quot;Light out of the earth&quot; or &quot;Out of the earth comes light&quot;. The phrase refers to both the abundant and winnable coal resources (which can be burnt, to produce &quot;light&quot;) in addition to their use in local industry such as Glass (through which light passes).

The motto of the town and larger borough was changed in 1974 to &quot;PROSPERITAS IN EXCELSIS&quot; (&quot;Success in the highest&quot;or &quot;Flourishing well&quot;), which is included on the arms of the Metropolitan borough Council.

After the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, Frank Cottrell Boyce the creative writer behind Danny Boyle&#x27;s opening ceremony revealed that the town motto was a significant influence to the Olympic cauldron designed by Thomas Heatherwick. The cauldron petals, once lit, started on the floor and rose up to form one torch.

The success and high profile of the games led the council and local residents to consider re-adopting &quot;Ex Terra Lucem&quot;. It was felt that it was more appropriate to the town&#x27;s history and had more meaning for local people, representing hope for the future. A number of people had raised this and requested that the Council consider replacing the motto.

A public consultation commenced on 17 January 2013 and at its meeting held on 17 April 2013, Council resolved to revert to the original motto of &quot;Ex Terra Lucem&quot;. The Coat of Arms remained the same.

===Parliamentary representation===
St Helens is represented by the St Helens South and Whiston and St Helens North constituencies. Both contain areas outside of the town boundary, but within the greater Borough. Each constituency sends 1 representative to Parliament.

At the general election in 2015 both Dave Watts and Shaun Woodward stood down from their seats. David Watts MP (St Helens North) had been incumbent since 1997, whilst Shaun Woodward MP (St Helens South and Whiston) had retained his seat since 2001. Watts received a life peerage and became Baron Watts in December 2015.

Conor McGinn (St Helens North) and Marie Rimmer (St Helens South and Whiston) were selected as Labour Party candidates and both were elected as MPs in 2015.

Rimmer and McGinn both held their seats at the 2019 general election.

In 2024 McGinn stood down and David Baines, also of the Labour Party, was elected.

The town is considered a Labour stronghold and to have &quot;safe (Labour) seats&quot;.

===Local council representation===

St Helens and its associated wards are represented by St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council.

The council was run by the Labour party from the first election in 1973 until an alliance between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives took control after the 2006 election. Labour regained a majority at the 2010 election and as of the 2014 election the council was composed of the following councillors:

Following the 2022 local elections, the composition of St Helens Borough Council was as follows:
===Parish councils===
St Helens is also served by several parish councils. Their activity is much reduced in the modern borough, but are still active in the communities and are recognised by the Borough Council as they may &quot;undertake many duties such as street lighting, managing cemeteries, allotments, commons, village halls, war memorials and markets etc&quot;.

St Helens Borough Council lists the parish councils as:

*Billinge Parish Council
*Bold Parish Council
*Eccleston Parish Council
*Rainford Parish Council
*Rainhill Parish Council
*Seneley Green Parish Council
*Windle Parish Council
==Demography==
Christianity is the main religion in St Helens Borough. At the 2001 census this was reported at around 87%. This made St Helens the &quot;most Christian town in Britain&quot; at that time. St Helens also had second fewest people (out of 376 local authorities) that actively described themselves as having no religion at all.

There is very little ethnic minority representation in St Helens, amongst the lowest levels in the country. 98.84% of the St Helens population described itself as White British in 2001. The largest ethnic minority in St Helens in 2001 was recorded as Indian with 409.

By 2006, the otherwise transient gypsy and traveller community have overtaken that number and are now considered to &quot;make up the largest identifiable ethnic minority group in St Helens&quot;.

===Theatre===
====The Citadel Theatre====

The first Theatre Royal was built on Bridge Street, opening in 1847 and was a large wooden barn. This was open for several seasons until heavy snow caused the roof to collapse. It was replaced by a new Theatre Royal on Milk Street.

Revill built a new theatre on Corporation Street and transferred the Theatre Royal name to this instead.

The Milk Street theatre was then purchased by the Salvation Army where it was more or less completely re-built internally. It was renamed SA Citadel and was used for this purpose for nearly 90 years, until the Salvation Army moved to a newer site. It was then opened as The Citadel Arts Centre in 1988 and was refurbished in 2000.

In 2019 it was announced that the Citadel Arts Centre would close on 30 June 2019 but that the Citadel Arts Charity would continue working with the support of a crowdfunding campaign.

====The Theatre Royal====

The Theatre Royal opened by Revill on Corporation Street in 1889 was relatively short-lived as it was severely damaged by fire in 1901. It was then reconstructed by revered theatre architect Frank Matcham. The Matcham theatre was designed in a baroque style with ornate balconies, chandeliers and boxes. In the 1960s the theatre was purchased by Pilkingtons and was gutted internally. The auditorium was refurbished removing all traces of the original interior design, whilst the ornate frontage was replaced with a plain glass façade. This was subsequently heavily refurbished in 2001.

The theatre is today a venue with touring acts and annual pantomime. There are performances by local amateur operatic and dramatic societies, schools and dancing academies.

<text>In computing, single instruction stream, single data stream (SISD) is a computer architecture in which a single uni-core processor executes a single instruction stream, to operate on data stored in a single memory. This corresponds to the von Neumann architecture.

SISD is one of the four main classifications as defined in Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy. In this system, classifications are based upon the number of concurrent instructions and data streams present in the computer architecture. According to Michael J. Flynn, SISD can have concurrent processing characteristics. Pipelined processors and superscalar processors are common examples found in most modern SISD computers.

Instructions are sent to the control unit from the memory module and are decoded and sent to the processing unit which processes on the data retrieved from memory module and sends back to it.

<text>McCoy Stadium is a former baseball stadium in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. From 1970 through 2020, it served as home field of the Pawtucket Red Sox (PawSox), a Minor League Baseball affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. Completed in 1942, the stadium first hosted an affiliated minor league team in 1946, the Pawtucket Slaters, a Boston Braves farm team. In 1981, the stadium hosted the longest professional baseball game in history, as the PawSox defeated the Rochester Red Wings in 33 innings by a score of 3–2.

==History==
===Early years===
The project to build the stadium began in 1938 and was championed by then-Pawtucket Mayor Thomas P. McCoy. It was to be built on a swampy piece of land known as Hammond&#x27;s Pond and, to this day, the stadium sits at the end of Pond Street. On the afternoon of November 3, 1940, Mayor McCoy laid the foundation cornerstone.

Initially known as Pawtucket Stadium, it was completed in 1942, and in 1946 was officially named in honor of Mayor McCoy, who had died in August 1945. McCoy Stadium first began hosting affiliated Minor League Baseball in 1946. The Pawtucket Slaters, a Class B affiliate of the Boston Braves, was the first team to call McCoy Stadium home. The Pawtucket Slaters would play for four seasons in the New England League, as Braves affiliates.

Professional baseball disappeared from Pawtucket for 16 years. It finally returned in 1966, as McCoy became home of the Pawtucket Indians, who competed at the Double-A level in the Eastern League as an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. After two seasons, the Indians moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, and McCoy was again without a team.

===Red Sox arrival===
In 1969, the Boston Red Sox had their Eastern League affiliate, the Pittsfield Red Sox of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, play at McCoy Stadium twice—one game in July and a doubleheader in August; the two events drew a total of over 10,000 fans. After the season, it was reported that the Pittsfield Red Sox would be relocated to McCoy Stadium. The team moved prior to the 1970 season, becoming the Pawtucket Red Sox, known colloquially as the &quot;PawSox&quot;. The franchise spent three seasons playing in the Double-A Eastern League before being promoted to the Triple-A International League.

In 1976, debt-ridden owner Phil Anez threatened to move the team to New Jersey, but sold the franchise to Marvin Adelson, who lost the ballclub after threatening to move to Massachusetts. During that year, the team was briefly known as the Rhode Island Red Sox, but that name lasted just one season. Just before the 1977 season, Canadian expatriate businessman Ben Mondor arrived and successfully resurrected the fallen franchise. Mondor owned the team until his death on October 3, 2010, and was a well-beloved member of the community, as he turned the ballpark and franchise into one of the most fan-friendly in all of professional baseball.

The PawSox brought four championship titles to McCoy Stadium and Pawtucket, winning the Governors&#x27; Cup (the International League championship since 1933) in 1973, 1984, 2012, and 2014.

===Red Sox departure===

In February 2015, a group of New England business leaders, led by Larry Lucchino, purchased the Pawtucket Red Sox. In August 2018, ownership announced that it would relocate the team to a new stadium in Worcester, Massachusetts, in April 2021, becoming the Worcester Red Sox.

While 2020 was planned to be the PawSox&#x27; final season of play at McCoy Stadium, the Minor League Baseball season was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Thus, the final game contested by the PawSox at McCoy Stadium was the team&#x27;s last game of the 2019 International League season, a 5–4 home victory over the Lehigh Valley IronPigs in 10 innings, played on September 2, 2019.

During the 2020 Major League Baseball season, McCoy Stadium served as the alternate training site for the Boston Red Sox.

===Abandonment and future plans===

Without the PawSox as a tenant, the future of McCoy Stadium is unclear. McCoy Stadium has been vacant since 2021; the condition of the ballpark has deteriorated due to the lack of active development on the property.

In December 2019, Pawtucket mayor Donald Grebien indicated alternatives to either bring another minor league team to Pawtucket or demolish the ballpark for a new use. In May 2021, Grebien noted future opportunity with independent baseball leagues, or governmental use such as a public safety complex or high school. In December 2021, Grebien endorsed the explorations of a city panel which proposed total demolition of the city-owned site for the construction of a high school complex that would consolidate and replace the district&#x27;s two existing schools. Initial renderings by SLAM architecture group show a 4-story academic complex with athletic facilities and an emphasis on CTE space. In November 2022, Pawtucket voters approved a $330 million bond to construct a new high school at the McCoy stadium site. The proposed 482,000-square-foot high school campus would consolidate Shea and Tolman high schools into one building for 2,500 students.

In July 2023, billionaire businessman Stefan Soloviev sought to purchase the stadium, fund the restorations needed, and try to bring in a minor league or independent league team. Pawtucket mayor Don Grebien thanked Soloviev for his interest and reiterated plans to demolish the stadium for the city&#x27;s new high school.

It was announced in January 2024 that McCoy Stadium would be demolished within the year.

==Stadium features==

One of the unique features of the ballpark is the expansive foul territory. The foul area forms a complete semicircle between first and third, and in order to fit the baselines in between the ends of the seating areas, the area behind home plate is quite vast. This is especially notable since the major league Red Sox&#x27; home park, Fenway Park, has the smallest foul territory in the majors.

The two dugouts are actually embedded into the wall underneath the grandstands (as are the luxury boxes, just beyond them). The first row of seats is elevated eight feet above field level. Despite that unusual box seat elevation, those seeking autographs of the players have found a way to contact their PawSox, using a technique more common to fans in bleacher seats behind an outfield wall. Fans wishing to have a scorebook, baseball, baseball card, or other souvenir signed by a player will go autograph &quot;fishing&quot;. Complete with hook and reel (or, often, a hollowed-out milk jug and a rope), autograph seekers lower their items over the front of the seats and dangle them down in front of the dugouts below. The ballplayers can sign the item, tug on the line, and the fan pulls up their newly autographed memorabilia.

A series of murals depicting notable former PawSox players was displayed in the stadium prior to the 1998 renovation, but was taken down since the new stadium configuration resulted in fans not passing them anymore. In 2004, after many fans asked what happened to them, funds were made available to restore and re-hang the old murals, as well as commission a few new ones of more recent players. Some six dozen paintings now adorn the entrance ramps throughout the stadium.

The left-field berm provides great views of the action, and affords families on a budget an inexpensive way to enjoy the ballpark. Above the berms are walkways, affording patrons 360° views of the ballpark. They are made especially for the handicapped from which to utilize and enjoy the game.

==Renovations==

For many years, McCoy Stadium was not up to International League standards. The park had only 6,000 seats and was barely handicapped accessible. There were also a number of broken seats, and the facility was starting to show structural issues in the mid-1990s. For several years, the team&#x27;s ownership was unsure of what to do, and it was even announced that the PawSox might be moved to Worcester, Massachusetts.

Eventually, owner Ben Mondor announced that they would renovate the facility, and that renovations would be done to maintain the historical integrity of the ballpark. The renovations began in 1998 and included a new terraced berm in left field, a grassy knoll where fans can sit next to the PawSox bullpen and watch the game up close.

The seating capacity was increased to 10,031 by adding three full sections of seats. In addition to the original quarter-circle seating bowl, McCoy now features an extended left-field line seating area and souvenir stand, as well as outfield bleacher seating and new parking areas. Luxury boxes were constructed below the new seating area at field level. All seats are now accessed through an entry tower near third base, instead of the circular ramps which still remain behind home plate. The seats are elevated above the field, and patrons must climb two sets of stairs (or take an elevator) to reach the main concourse and outfield berm areas.

With the renovations to the stadium, the Pawtucket Red Sox raised their average game day attendance to a league-leading 9,561 in 2005.

==Notable games and incidents==
* On April 18, 1981, the Pawtucket Red Sox began the longest game in professional baseball history. For 20 innings, the PawSox battled the Rochester Red Wings in a 1–1 tie. The Red Wings would finally score in the top of the 21st inning to take the lead. The PawSox then scored a run in the bottom of the inning. The game was far from over. The game went on until 4:07 a.m. because the umpires did not have a curfew rule in their copy of the rule book. Finally the league president was reached and demanded that the game be suspended. The score was tied, 2–2 after the 32nd inning. When the game finally did resume on June 23, it took only 18 minutes to complete, as Dave Koza of the PawSox drove in the winning run in the bottom of the 33rd inning. Two future Hall of Famers were part of the historic game. Cal Ripken Jr. went 2–13 on the night playing third base for Rochester. Wade Boggs played third base for Pawtucket and went 4–12 with a double and an RBI. 19 fans remained in the stands when the game was called for the night, and they received lifetime passes to McCoy Stadium.
* On April 9, 1992, during the PawSox&#x27; home opener against Rochester, WJAR sports reporter Joe Rocco started a live report on the side of the field, while the game was in progress, for that day&#x27;s 6 p.m. edition of &quot;News Watch 10&quot;. Because the bright newscamera lights bothered some of the players, the home plate umpire went over and told Rocco that they were not going to hold up the game for a live news report. Rocco asked for 30 seconds to finish his report, but the umpire refused and called security to eject Rocco, forcing Rocco to end his live report.
* On July 3, 2001, PawSox player Israel &quot;Izzy&quot; Alcantara was hit by a pitch by Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons pitcher Blas Cedeño. Feeling that he had been thrown at, Alcantara responded by kicking catcher Jeremy Salazar in the chest and then charging the mound. The pitcher backed away, and after momentarily trying to get anyone on the Red Barons to fight, Alcantara was engulfed in the ensuing bench-clearing brawl. Alcantara was suspended for six games.
* On July 14, 2004, McCoy Stadium hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game between the International League and the Pacific Coast League. The IL won the game, 4–3 in 10 innings, before a crowd of 11,192.
* On April 26, 2006, during that season&#x27;s minor league umpire strike, Durham Bulls player and Tampa Bay Devil Rays prospect Delmon Young threw a bat at a replacement umpire who had ejected him from the game. Young struck out on a called third strike, and stood at the plate (silently, according to PawSox catcher Corky Miller) before walking away. When the umpire signaled that he was ejected, Young responded by throwing his bat, end-over-end, at the umpire, who was hit in his chest protector with the bat. The International League suspended Young for 50 games for the incident.
* McCoy has seen two perfect games thrown by PawSox pitchers. On June 1, 2000, Tomokazu Ohka defeated the Charlotte Knights 2–0, needing just 76 pitches to retire all 27 Charlotte batters. On August 10, 2003, Bronson Arroyo blanked the Buffalo Bisons by a score of 7–0. Arroyo was called up to the Boston Red Sox later that month.

==Attendance==
When Ben Mondor bought control of the team in 1977, the PawSox drew only 70,354 fans (1,082 per game) to McCoy, which seated 5,800 people at the time. A few seats were added along the way, and during the mid-1990s, the park&#x27;s capacity was listed as 7,002.

In 1999, the first season after the McCoy expansion, the PawSox averaged a paid attendance of 8,403 per game, and in 2000 it increased to 8,733. That figure represented 87% of every seat for every game being sold, where no other team in the league was above 70%. The club&#x27;s top two attendance figures have come in 2004 and 2005, and with a paid attendance of 688,421, the &#x27;05 PawSox ranked fourth among all minor-league teams in any sport in North America. In New England, they ranked as the biggest draw of any sporting event except their parent club, the Red Sox at Fenway Park.

Going into the 2006 season, the top 88 single-game attendance figures have come in the past seven years since the expansion. The current record crowd of 11,802 was set on September 5, 2004, for a late-season game against Scranton with the PawSox in playoff contention. (The season finale the next day, at 11,067, ranks 13th.) Prior to the expansion, the notable single-game record occurred on July 1, 1982, when 9,389 showed up for the pitching match-up of Mark Fidrych versus Dave Righetti.

==Other events==
===Political rally===
On October 30, 1944, then Senator and Vice-Presidential candidate Harry S. Truman addressed a Democratic rally at the stadium, in support of re-electing President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

===High school football===

Once a year, on the night before Thanksgiving, football is played inside McCoy Stadium. Tolman High School and Saint Raphael Academy play their regular season games at the adjacent Pariseau Field (also known as the McCoy Annex). But, for 73 years, the two schools played each other on Thanksgiving, with most of those games played inside McCoy Stadium. That holiday rivalry ended in 2001 but the games still continue. The schools alternate the use of the stadium. Tolman hosts their new rival, the crosstown Shea High School, on the odd-number years. Saint Raphael will host Moses Brown School on the even-number years. In the mid-1990s the original Saints-Tolman game moved from Thanksgiving morning to the night before.

===Concerts===
For three years, McCoy Stadium hosted an annual concert during the summer. Bob Dylan was the first to perform at the stadium in 2006. Collective Soul, Live and Counting Crows performed in 2007. In 2008, Boston-based bands The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Dropkick Murphys performed at McCoy as part of a three-stadium tour. The tour also included LeLacheur Park in Lowell, Massachusetts, and Hadlock Field in Portland, Maine. These stadiums have also been home to Boston Red Sox minor league teams, respectively the Lowell Spinners and, currently, Portland Sea Dogs.

===Dining on the Diamond===
After the cancellation of the 2020 minor league baseball season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PawSox developed a &quot;Dining on the Diamond&quot; program which served dinner to nearly 6,000 people on the baseball field from June through August, with a waiting list of more than 3,600 entering September.

<doc id="1103638" wikidata="Q7856033" url="?curid=1103638" title="Turning Point (American band)">
<text>Turning Point was an American straight edge hardcore punk band from New Jersey that existed from 1988 to 1991. Their early releases had the sound of youth crew, with lyrics relating to social issues or being straight edge. The later material was a lot more emo-influenced, integrating more emotional lyrics, softer vocal delivery, and octave chords.

This eventually led the way for other straight edge/hardcore bands to do so, such as Split Lip and Falling Forward.

Lead singer Skip Candelori and guitarist Jay Laughlin previously formed Moorestown, New Jersey–based Pointless. Ken Flavell (drums) originally played drums with brother Chris Flavell in the early southern New Jersey hardcore band Failsafe. Nick Greif (bass) previously played bass in the late-1980s straight edge hardcore band Awareness.

Candelori died in 2002 of an accidental drug overdose.

In March 2016, it was announced that the band would perform at the This Is Hardcore festival in Philadelphia in August. Tim McMahon (Mouthpiece), Geoff Rickly (Thursday, United Nations) and Rob Fish (Release, Resurrection, 108) performed vocals for this appearance.

<doc id="1103642" wikidata="Q4767536" url="?curid=1103642" title="Anna Telugu Desam Party">
<text>The Anna Telugu Desam Party (ATDP) was a regional political party in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It was founded by Nandamuri Harikrishna, the third son of the film star and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) founder N. T. Rama Rao (NTR) on 26 January 1999. The party was formed following internal differences within the TDP but struggled to make a electoral impact. Harikrishna eventually returned to the TDP in 2006, and ATDP was delisted by the Election Commission of India in 2016.

==History==
Nandamuri Harikrishna established the Anna Telugu Desam Party (ATDP) on 26 January 1999 after a fallout with TDP leader N. Chandrababu Naidu. Harikrishna had previously sided with Naidu along with the majority of TDP legislators, during the 1995 internal coup within the TDP, which led to his father NTR’s removal as party leader, triggered by dissatisfaction with the involvement of NTR’s second wife, Lakshmi Parvathi in party and state affairs. Following the coup, Harikrishna was appointed as the Minister ot Transport in the Andhra Pradesh state government. However, dissatisfaction with Naidu’s leadership led him to part ways and establish ATDP.

Shortly after its formation, Rajya Sabha MP Daggubati Venkateswara Rao left the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to join ATDP on 28 January 1999. Another Rajya Sabha MP, Yarlagadda Lakshmi Prasad, also joined the party, giving the party two seats in the upper house of the Parliament of India. Additionally, S. Madhusudhana Chary, who had earlier been a member of the NTR Telugu Desam Party (Lakshmi Parvathi) (NTRTDP-LP), represented ATDP in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly.

In the lead-up to the 1999 Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, ATDP formed an alliance with the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), both of which had been former allies of the TDP. However, internal disagreements over ATDP’s stance on banning foreign-born individuals, including Sonia Gandhi, from holding the Prime Minister’s position created a rift within the alliance.

ATDP fielded 191 candidates in the 1999 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election but failed to win any seats, securing only 371,718 votes (1.12% of the total votes in the state). In the same year’s Lok Sabha elections, the party contested 20 constituencies but again failed to secure any seats, receiving just 244,045 votes (0.73% of the total votes in the state).

The party’s failure to make an electoral impact led to its decline. By 2006, Harikrishna returned to the TDP and was elected to the Rajya Sabha as a TDP member in 2008. Over the years, ATDP’s relevance diminished, and in 2016, the party was officially delisted by the Election Commission of India.

<doc id="1103649" wikidata="Q5118264" url="?curid=1103649" title="Churchtown, Merseyside">
<text>Churchtown is a suburb of Southport, Merseyside, England. Historically in Lancashire, it is surrounded by Crossens, High Park and Marshside in the ancient parish of North Meols on the northern fringe of what is now Southport.

== History ==
In 1575, a shipwreck occurred off the Churchtown coast, the cargo of which contained potatoes, was washed ashore. Subsequently, the village became the first place in England where they were grown.

The Botanic Gardens was at one time the terminus for the Southport tram system, and evidence can be seen in the large turning circle at the front of the gardens. Stocks dating from 1741 can be found adjacent to the church wall on St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Road close to Botanic Gardens. The centre of the old village retains much of its character from bygone ages - with the green in front of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church flanked by the two local pubs - the Bold Arms and the Hesketh Arms. This is covered by a preservation order which covers much of Botanic Road, where some thatched cottages still exist. On one side of the Hesketh Arms is the entrance to Meols Hall, home of the Hesketh family.

== Geography ==
Churchtown is situated in North West England. The closest cities are Preston to the north east and Liverpool to the south. Churchtown is a suburb of Southport which has the nearest town centre.

To the North of Churchtown, is Crossens, which is the most northerly suburb of Southport. To the west of Churchtown is Marshside, to the east High Park, and to the south is the Hesketh Park area.

The village is one of many villages on the West Lancashire Coastal Plain, most of the village is only slightly above sea-level just like the nearby village of Banks which means the village can be susceptible to flooding during heavy rainfall. There are embankments to the north of nearby Marshside and there are drainage systems across the area, the closest being the Three Pools Waterway to the East of the village which is controlled by the pumping station at the Banks/ Crossens border.

== Education ==
Churchtown has one primary school (Churchtown Primary School) which is situated on St Cuthbert&#x27;s Road and access is also available via Botanic Gardens The school is a &quot;community school&quot; (i.e. not a church school) but is closely associated with St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church. It is among the ten biggest primary schools in the country, with nearly 900 pupils, and was described by OFSTED in February 2010 as &quot;outstanding&quot; (grade 1). In 2017, there was a further short inspection and the school was rated &quot;good&quot; 

== Religious sites ==

The village has four churches
* St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church - Church of England - St Cuthberts Road
* Churchtown United Reformed Church - Non-Conformist - Botanic Road
* Marshside Road Methodist Church - on the border between Churchtown and Marshside
* St Patrick Catholic Church, Marshside Road

Some contents remain under the control of Merseyside Museums, and the dug-out canoe formerly in the Museum was placed in the Atkinson, Southport Town Centre in 2014 after preservation treatment.
* Library. Closed 2014 as a result of government national budgetary cuts. The library building was demolished shortly after closure, probably because it was largely of wooden construction and so at particular risk of vandalism and fire.

== Leisure ==
Southport Old Links is a golf Course situated to the south of the village.

== Transport ==
Churchtown railway station was a stop on the West Lancashire Railway to Crossens and Preston. The line closed in 1964.
The A565 road runs through the north of the village and is considered by some local people to be the boundary of Churchtown and Marshside. There are many bus stops throughout the village and local area which link to all over the Southport area and suburbs, with services extending into Liverpool, West Lancashire, and Preston.

<text>Churchtown () is a largely residential affluent suburb on the southside of Dublin, between Rathfarnham and Dundrum.

==Landmarks==

===Ely&#x27;s Arch===

Braemor Road is marked by a gate lodge in the style of a triumphal arch from the 18th century, which originally led to Rathfarnham Castle. The erection of this gateway is attributed to Henry Loftus, Earl of Ely from 1769 to 1783 who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the new gate on Frizell&#x27;s map of 1779. After the division of the estate in 1913, the arch became the entrance to the Castle Golf Club but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct Woodside Drive entrance. Braemor Road (and Braemor Drive, Braemor Avenue, etc.) was developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s by builders called Brady and Morton. They conflated and abbreviated the names resulting in the name Braemor.

===Bottle Tower===

The Bottle Tower (or Hall&#x27;s Barn) is a structure on Whitehall Road. It was built by Major Hall in 1742 in imitation of the better constructed Wonderful Barn erected about the same period near Leixlip. The floors and other timber work have long disappeared and the winding stone steps are not considered safe to ascend. While the ground floor may have been used as a barn, the first and second floors appear to have been habitable as they are both fitted with fireplaces. A smaller structure behind the barn, built on somewhat similar lines was a pigeon house.

The old house named Whitehall, which was demolished some years ago, stood adjacent to the barn. It was also built by Major Hall around the same time. In 1778 it became the residence of Rev. Jeremy Walsh, curate of Dundrum, and in 1795 it was converted into a boarding house by Mr. Ml. Kelly. A newspaper advertisement in 1816 invites enquiries from prospective visitors. In a description written in the last century the old-fashioned kitchen and panelled staircase are specially noted.

&quot;Lewis&#x27; Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837)&quot; features many of the old houses in Churchtown under the reference village of Rathfarnham. The houses include Landscape, of H. O&#x27;Callaghan, Esq.; Whitehall, of W. P. Matthews, Esq.; Newtown, of John Kirby, Esq., LL.D., M.D., in the grounds of which there are some very fine evergreens. Also included is Barton Lodge, of W. Conlan, Esq. which probably gave the name of Barton Road, Rathfarnam and Barton Road East, Churchtown. Nutgrove, of P. Jones, Esq. which was situated on Nutgrove Avenue, halfway between the Good Shepherd church and Rathfarnam village and Whitehall, of T. Laffan, Esq., an out-office of which is built in the shape of a pottery furnace, with a winding flight of steps on the outside to the top, whence there is a commanding prospect of the surrounding country repeats our description of the Bottle Tower.

&quot;Rocque’s 1760 map of Dublin&quot; shows Newtown House at the bottom on the South Dublin county council historical map site. To the left of Newtown (or south) and along The Glen river would be Landscape House and Whitehall House. Above these (or west) would be Nutgrove House – halfway to Rathfarnam village.

&quot;Taylor&#x27;s 1816 map&quot; of the environs of Dublin gives a view of Churchtown, east of Ely&#x27;s Demense. This shows the present Landscape area, Newtown House (now Villas), Whitehall and Whitebarn. Landscape Road features between the Glen River and Newtown House and this seems to swing left onto modern day Braemor Road before meeting the modern day Dodder Park Road at Ely&#x27;s Arch. Nutgrove School also features, then The Ponds and further south is Barton Lane.

&quot;William Duncan&#x27;s maps of the county of Dublin (1821)&quot; shows White Barn and Newtown Villas. To the left of Newtown is a large house on what probably became Braemor Park. This was possibly Fetherstonaugh House which became the Church of Ireland Theological College or more likely Ardavon House which was the original Mount Carmel hospital building.

===Berwick House===

Berwick House is a tall building at the bend in Whitehall Road. Recently occupied by the De La Salle Brothers, it seems to be identical to a house named Waxfield where the death is recorded in 1766 of John Lamprey. In 1836 it was known as Hazelbrook, a name which was later transferred to the nearby, now defunct, Hughes Brothers milk bottling plant. The Hughes Brothers original house, built in 1898, and called Hazelbrook House, was rebuilt in the Bunratty Folk Park in 2001. From 1844 to 1899 it was known as Bachelor&#x27;s Hall, after which it became the headquarters of a Charitable Institution under the name of Berwick Home. In 1944 it again became a private residence and the name was changed to Berwick House.

===The Ponds===
Loreto Terrace on the north side of Rathfarnam&#x27;s Loreto Abbey was formerly known as &quot;the Ponds&quot;, a name originating apparently from the large pond which two hundred years ago occupied the low-lying field between Loreto Terrace and Nutgrove Avenue. This area was described in Weston St. John Joyce&#x27;s &quot;The Neighbourhood of Dublin&quot; in 1912 as the &quot;dilapidated locality known as the Ponds&quot; but it has since been largely rebuilt. An old photograph from Larry O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s collection shows what it looked like at that time. The last of the old houses was demolished in the mid-1980s. It was a very early 18th century gabled residence named Grove Cottage and was probably the oldest occupied house in Dublin.
This place was the scene of a skirmish at the outbreak of the rising of 1798. The insurgents of the south county assembled at the Ponds on 24 May 1798 under the leadership of David Keely, James Byrne, Edward Keogh and Ledwich. The latter two had been members of Lord Ely&#x27;s yeomanry but had taken to the field with the United Irishmen. The insurgents were attacked by the local yeomanry corps but were able to defend themselves and the yeomanry was forced to retreat. A party of regular troops was then sent against them and a stiff encounter took place. A number of the insurgents were killed or wounded and some prisoners taken including Keogh and Ledwich. The survivors retreated, joining up with a party from Clondalkin, and a further engagement took place at the turnpike on the Rathcoole road where the enemy was successfully repulsed.

==Demographics==
Based on the 2006 Census, the population of Churchtown was 8,736, a small decrease from the 2002 census. The break-out by electoral area was as follows:
Churchtown-Castle 1,244
Churchtown-Landscape 1,198
Churchtown-Nutgrove 3,100
Churchtown-Orwell 1,871
Churchtown-Woodlawn 1,323
==Amenities==
Churchtown has a number of shops and pubs, including a mid-size supermarket, which has one of Dublin&#x27;s few kosher sales facilities. It is also one of Dublin&#x27;s centres for the driving test with the highest pass rate in the county, the ninth highest in Ireland, at 48.31%.

===Nutgrove Shopping Centre===
Nutgrove Shopping Centre was opened in October 1984 in what was then still a rural part of Dublin. The site for the shopping centre was located on part of the old Lamb&#x27;s Jam orchards.

The centre included Ireland and Europe&#x27;s first drive through restaurant when McDonald&#x27;s opened a branch there. The American style experience of driving up to the window, ordering your food and driving away was a novelty at the time.

There were other firsts when Nutgrove opened, including the country&#x27;s first social welfare services office was located in a shopping mall.

===Religion===

The suburb of Churchtown is probably named after St. Nahi&#x27;s Church (Church of Ireland) just off the Churchtown road. It is more easily viewed these days from the William Dargan Bridge, close to Dundrum village. St. Nahi&#x27;s was rebuilt several times—in 950, 1650 and 1750. The present restoration was completed in 1910. The public housing flats in Churchtown, across from the Bottle Tower pub, are named St. Nathy&#x27;s after the church. The baptismal font in St. Nahi&#x27;s Church church was moved there from St. Kevin&#x27;s church and is the same font that was used to baptise Arthur Wellesley, The Duke of Wellington in 1769.

The local Roman Catholic church is the Good Shepherd Church. It was the site of the state funeral of former Taoiseach Seán Lemass, who lived on Hillside Drive.

The Church of Ireland Theological Institute (the theological seminary of the Church of Ireland) and the Representative Church Body Library (the central library of the Church of Ireland) are both on Braemor Park, Churchtown.

The Quakers have a Meeting House on the Lower Churchtown Road.

===Education===
The Good Shepherd National School is a co-educational national school in the parish of Churchtown while the mixed secondary school is De La Salle College. The De La Salle Brothers are the trustees of the college and it is under the control of a board of management. The school&#x27;s past pupils include Damien Duff, who retired from the Republic of Ireland national football team in 2012. Jim Stynes who won an All-Ireland Minor (under 18) football championship medal for Dublin in 1984, and the Brownlow medal in Australian Rules Football in 1991. Jim&#x27;s younger brother, Brian Stynes, also went to De La Salle College; he won a senior All Ireland football medal for Dublin in 1995. Des Fitzgerald, the former Irish international prop forward and father of current international player Luke, is a past pupil of DLS National and DLS College. He played in Croke Park in 1968 as a member of the DLS N.S. (old name for The Good Shepherd National School) Gaelic football team and in Lansdowne Road for the DLS Senior Rugby team later in 1975. Another player on both teams was John Treacy, the former Dublin Hurling full-back and father of current Dublin Hurling star, David Treacy.

The former local girls&#x27; secondary school was Notre Dame School, one of whose alumni is Mary Lou McDonald, the current president of Sinn Féin and a Teachta Dála (TD).McDonald was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), from 2004 to 2009 representing the Dublin constituency (Leaving Certificate class of 1988). On the 19th Oct 2016, The Notre Dame Schools Trust announced that the school would close, due to a lack of funding, and outstanding debts. The Department of Education acquired the Notre Dame campus and will use it for school purposes in the future.

===Former school===
A De La Salle Preparatory School, now closed, was located in Camberley House (also known as &quot;Inish More&quot; or &quot;Inish Ealga&quot;) on the Churchtown Road Upper. A previous owner was the widow of Éamonn Ceannt, one of the signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. Camberley House was bought for the De La Salle boys&#x27; school and later developed as the preparatory school when the secondary school moved to its present location.

===Health===
Mount Carmel Community Hospital, which stands on a 4.9-acre site on Braemor Park, re-opened as a short-stay nursing home in September 2015.

===Politics===
Churchtown is part of the Dáil Éireann constituency of Dublin Rathdown. Although most of Churchtown is part of the Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council area, because the parish originated from Rathfarnam Parish, many of the historical aspects can be viewed at the South Dublin County Council website

<doc id="1103655" wikidata="Q3827349" url="?curid=1103655" title="William Hayman Cummings">
<text>William Hayman Cummings (22 August 1831 – 5 June 1915) was an English musician, tenor and organist at Waltham Abbey Church.

Cummings was born in Sidbury (near Sidmouth) in Devon. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Choir School and the City of London School, becoming a pupil of Dr E. J. Hopkins, J. W. Hobbs and Alberto Randegger, and was for many years a chorister in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the Temple Church.

In 1847, as a teenager, he was one of the choristers when Felix Mendelssohn conducted the first London performance of his &quot;Elijah&quot; at Exeter Hall. Cummings also sang at numerous festivals and concerts throughout Great Britain and twice toured in the United States. His performance at the Triennial Festival of the Handel and Haydn Society in Boston was noticed as follows by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; of 15 May 1871:
The tenor is also a new-comer, brought from England for this occasion, Mr. Wm. H. Cummings. He is a slightly-built gentleman, about five feet ten inches high, has light hair, a receding forehead, a light gentlemanly-looking (but not distingue) mustache, and stands quietly while singing. His voice is a tenor of good volume, and admirable quality—like a silver trumpet. The intonation is to be relied on, and his delivery of the tone pleasant. The words are delivered as well as possible, both in recitative and the airs. I doubt whether Mr. Cummings be a great singer, yet he is a better oratorio tenor than I have heard. He is entirely innocent of tremolo and absurd affectation.

He is credited in 1855 with linking music adapted from Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Festgesang&quot; to Charles Wesley&#x27;s words &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;, which are now universally inextricably linked. At the Birmingham Festival he was the last-minute tenor soloist at the premiere of &quot;The Masque at Kenilworth&quot; (1866) by Arthur Sullivan, taking Giovanni Matteo Mario&#x27;s place (with only half-an-hour&#x27;s notice to prepare). He was also the tenor soloist there for the premiere of the sacred cantata &quot;The Woman of Samaria&quot; by William Sterndale Bennett in 1867.

Cummings founded the Purcell Society in 1876. He served as singing professor at the Royal Academy of Music for 15 years beginning in 1879. He held strong views on singing and delivered the occasional stern tirade attacking the &quot;pernicious vibrato&quot;. As late as 1907 he gave an address on &quot;The Culture of the Voice&quot; in which he praised the messa di voce (which was obsolete by then) and, according to the &quot;Derby Daily Telegraph&quot; of 4 January 1907, administered:
a crushing rebuke to those who indulge in what is known as the &#x27;tremolo&#x27;. It is, as the Doctor said, a reprehensible habit. Apart from the fact that it mars the beauty of many fine voices, it is, I agree, &quot;a most distressing fault to the auditors, who frequently listen in doubt as to the precise pitch of the note the singer is endeavouring to produce&quot;.

He later became a professor and later the principal of the Guildhall School of Music. One of his notable pupils at the school was conductor Bruce Carey. He received an honorary doctorate in music from the University of Dublin in 1900 and was made a gentleman of the Chapel Royal. In 1902, he published a book on the origins of &quot;God Save the King&quot;.
Cummings&#x27; other appointments included:

*Professor, The Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind
*Council Member, Incorporated Society of Musicians
*Vice-President, Royal College of Organists
*Vice-President, Royal Musical Association
*Hon. Treasurer, Royal Society of Musicians
*Hon. Treasurer, Philharmonic Society
*President, Incorporated Staff Sight Singing College

Cummings married Clara Anne Hobbs, a daughter of his teacher, the well-known singer John William Hobbs (1799–1877).

He died in London and is buried in West Norwood Cemetery, South London.

<text>The Hollyford River / Whakatipu Kā Tuka is in the southwest of the South Island of New Zealand. It runs for through Fiordland, its sources being close to the Homer Tunnel and in Gertrude Valley in the southern Darran Mountains.

At first, the river flows southeast and east, coming as close as 1 km to the east–west divide of the South Island, before continuing north through the glacier-formed Hollyford Valley. Near the end, the river passes through Lake McKerrow before reaching Martins Bay on the coast of the Tasman Sea north of Milford Sound.

The Hollyford Track follows the river&#x27;s course. Part of the river&#x27;s course is traditionally regarded as the boundary between the Southland and Otago regions, however, current maps show the entirety of the Hollyford Valley contained within the Southland Region.

In January 1863 Patrick Quirk Caples explored the river, naming it after his home town of Hollyford, County Tipperary in Ireland. Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the river was officially altered to Hollyford River / Whakatipu Kā Tuka.

In September 1863 James Hector used the names Kaduku River and Kakapo Lake for Hollyford River and Lake M’Kerrow. These names were occasionally used in later accounts.

Three sections of the river are regularly travelled by kayak:

*Monkey Creek - Falls Creek: Grade: V+ 
*Falls Creek - Marian Swingbridge: Grade: III - IV 
*Marian Creek Run: Grade: IV - V

<doc id="1103679" wikidata="Q456001" url="?curid=1103679" title="Minjung">
<text>Minjung () is a Korean word that combines the two hanja characters &quot;min&quot; () and &quot;jung&quot; (). &quot;Min&quot; is from &quot;inmin&quot; (), which may be translated as &quot;the people&quot;, and &quot;jung&quot; is from &quot;daejung&quot; (), which may be translated as &quot;the public&quot;. Thus, &quot;minjung&quot; can be translated to mean &quot;the masses&quot; or &quot;the people.&quot;

However, in the Korean political and cultural context, &quot;the public&quot; is not an adequate translation, and &quot;the people&quot; carries a communist connotation that makes its use dangerous in anti-communist South Korea. Nonetheless, &quot;the people&quot; is close to what &quot;minjung&quot; seeks to convey, both sociologically and politically. For Koreans, &quot;minjung&quot; are those who are oppressed politically, exploited economically, marginalized sociologically, despised culturally, and condemned religiously. For example, the Minjung Party founded in October 2017.

Thus, the notion of &quot;minjung&quot; came to identify and inform the struggle for democracy in South Korea. In other words, the concept of minjung functions as a type of worldview that offers the categories in which social reality is organized and comprehended. One of the basic precepts of this worldview is that history should be understood from the point of view of the &quot;minjung&quot;, or that the &quot;minjung&quot; are the subjects (and not victims) of history.

The idea of Minjung can be traced back to the late Joseon dynasty&#x27;s Silhak movement through the works of Jeong Yak-yong and Yi Hwang.

== Background ==
After the Korean War ended and South Korea ran its own government under their first president, Syngman Rhee, there were several military coups and forces involved in a reformation of the new government. Notably, there was President Park Chung Hee (1961–1979, namely the Third and Fourth Republic) and President Chun Doo-hwan (1980-1988, namely the Fifth Republic).

=== Park Chung-hee (1961–1979) ===
While &quot;Minjung&quot; (the mass of people) was suffering and struggling from a decade of mismanagement and corruption by the Rhee presidency (aka First Republic era), a major student uprising, and some American interference, managed to oust Syngman Rhee. Afterwards, a group of military officers led by General Park Chung Hee seized power in South Korea through a coup d&#x27;état, and declared himself chairman of supreme council. Under pressure by the United States, Park finally resign his post and narrowly won the Presidential election in October 1963. The period from 1965 to 1971 was one of rapid economic growth and comparative political stability. To achieve economic stability, Park Chung Hee created the first Five-Year Economic Development Plan (to start in 1962), the first such overall development program ever prepared for Korea. The five-year plan gave priority to the following things:

# Development of energy industries such as coal production and electric power
# Expansion of agricultural production aimed at increasing farm income and correction of the structural imbalance of the national economy
# Development of basic industries and the economic infrastructure
# Maximum utilization of idle resources; increased employment; conservation and utilization of land
# Improvement of the balance of payments through export promotion
# Promotion of science and technology.

Park ran for reelection in 1967, and became the president of the Third and Fourth Republic of Korea; he served for 16 years.

== Minjung movement ==
=== Labor movements ===
==== YH Company protest ====
In August 1979, around 200 young female workers at YH Trading Company protested the company&#x27;s decision to close down. YH had become a huge wig exporting company during the 1960s; however, the company&#x27;s position had significantly deteriorated by the end of the 1970s.

On August 7, 1979, YH Company closed down. The young women workers protested and fasted against the company&#x27;s closure. The police got involved and forcefully removed the women from the building. During this violent action, one young worker was killed. Her death was significant and triggered many protest movements throughout South Korea. It may be considered one of the most important sparks of opposition towards President Park Chung Hee and the demise of his presidency.

=== Gwangju Democratization Movement ===
The Gwangju Democratization Movement, officially renamed the Gwangju Uprising in 1987, began on May 18, 1980. The citizens of Gwangju, seeking the abolition of martial law and the resignation of General Chun Doo-hwan, initiated the movement. As General Chun Doo-hwan and the military tried to maintain martial law, students and some civilians came together to demonstrate their disapproval. On May 18, 200 male students tried to enter a school that was forced into closure by officials. During the attempt, the students were heavily injured. Seeing this, civilians decided to join in but were stopped by military forces. In the end, many civilians were injured and killed, thus starting the Gwangju Movement. On May 19, as the movement grew to 5000 civilians, the military brought in an armoured motorcar and marched in with guns wielding fixed-bayonets. On May 20, 200,000 civilians marched through the military force and stopped all communications systems in the city so the military would not bring in reinforcements. Thus, Gwangju was freed.

Chun Doo-hwan was the ROK army general and president of South Korea from 1980 to 1988. Chun started his coup by making himself head of the KCIA and keeping his position as head of the Defense Security of Command. Minjung gathered to the streets to protest and demonstrate their opinions about Chun&#x27;s action. On May 17, 1980, Chun declared martial law to finalize his coup. Chun fired and arrested high officials and students who were opposed to his actions. On the next day, martial law was declared and about 500 people came together to Gwangju&#x27;s streets to protest and demand the repeal of the martial law. &quot;One woman student was pilloried near the town square, where a paratrooper attacked her breasts with a bayonet.&quot; The soldiers shot and killed people who kept protesting and refused to go home. Gwangju Rebellion is also called Gwangju massacre because of the number of casualties inflicted on the protesters. It is unclear how many people actually died in the Gwangju Rebellion, but one source indicates the number to be between 2,300 and 4,900 deaths in May 1980.

As a result of this chaos, Chun took it upon himself to isolate about 37,000 journalists, students, teachers, labor organizers, and civil servants in condemned and confined camps up in the mountain areas to promote &quot;a time of cleansing their minds and spirits.&quot; Chun was not willing to let these movements go without making it very clear that he was not going to tolerate this. He said he was setting up these boot camps for those &quot;who would see the error of their ways after lots of push-ups, marathon running, small-group criticism and self-criticism, and ideological exhortation.&quot;

=== World-wide democratization ===
The 1980s marked a worldwide spark of democratization. The decline of the Soviet Union Bloc led to the breakdown of European Communist regimes in 1989. The Polish Solidarity Movement is one example of major revolutions during the 1980s. Much of dictatorships in Latin America also collapsed. In Philippines, the ousting of dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the subsequent &quot;yellow revolution&quot; led the way to democratization. These circumstances worldwide bear resemblance with the fall of the Chun regime, and the revolutions are akin to the Gwangju incident (albeit the discrepancies in human casualties). Scholar Samuel P. Huntington referred to this period as the &quot;Third Wave&quot; of Democratization.

=== Anti-American sentiments ===
The United States&#x27; supposed involvement in the Gwangju Democratization Struggle triggered the rapid spread of anti-Americanism sentiments. The protesters were expecting Americans to intervene for their side. Instead, the Twentieth Division of the ROK Army was sent to the area in response to the uprising. Although many Koreans, and especially those who had favored or participated in the movement, blamed the U.S. Government for &quot;releasing&quot; these troops from their duties near the DMZ, the American general in charge of defending against North Korean (DPRK) attack had no idea that they were going to be moved. He was awakened by a late-night telephone call by the ROK president, informing him that the Twentieth had been removed from their positions along the DMZ—thus creating a huge gap in the defensive line in the event of large-scale infiltration from the North—and sent south to Gwangju. Nevertheless, because the U.S. Command was nominally in control of joint forces, the urban legend persists that the United States was responsible for the forcible repression of the uprising by military means. Because of this, the US took a portion of the blame:

Initially, before Gwangju, there were negative attitudes towards the United States growing because of their support of Chun Doo-hwan. But Gwangju really catalyzed the Anti-Americanism among Koreans.

=== Student protests ===
During the presidential election in March 1960, Syngman Rhee sought out a fourth term. Considering his age of eighty-five, there was serious concern for Rhee&#x27;s health and his future fulfillment of leadership within the Liberal Party. Therefore, in order to maintain power, the Liberal Party gained the desire to win at all costs. The Liberal Party did end up winning the election; Syngman Rhee and Yi Kibung (Vice President) officially won. However, the election process was corrupted. The &quot;ballot boxes had been stuffed with votes for the government candidates even before the voting took place.&quot; In reaction to the Liberal Party&#x27;s rigged victory, the outraged citizens and students of all ages protested through street demonstrations. As a declaration indicting the government&#x27;s abuse of power, on April 19, 1960, Yi Sujong expressed: &quot;We want to plant the seeds of reason, truth, freedom, and the spirit of the university in the barren soil of our country.&quot; Through the protest, the students became a power of influence among the people of Korea. Although the South Korean government had claimed to be a &quot;democratic&quot; nation, its actions did not display the exercise of democracy. The students sparked a vital movement in South Korea. These protests are evidence of students understanding of their own power and capabilities to influence the nation. Students were fervent in their search for their own rights because they learned from history. A middle schooler by the name of Kim Chu-yol in a sense became a symbol of the sacrifice for freedom. They needed to fight for their rights just like their fathers. &quot;Look at the torch of freedom that we are now raising! Listen, in these hours of darkness, as we proudly toll the bell of freedom, just as our fathers and elder brothers did under the iron yoke of the Japanese imperialist&quot;. This was a new type of movement to which Korea was not accustomed which would be a key instrument in allowing students to begin to voice their opinions and fight for their rights.

=== Normalization Treaty protest ===
In the 1960s, Park Chung Hee saw normalization of relations with Japan as a way to gain start-up capital for industrial development. Mass demonstrations ensued against the signing of the normalization treaty. Demonstrators were met with military force in 1964, but in 1965, the treaty was ratified.

=== Importance of the church ===
Following the model of Liberation Theology established in the Latin American states, the Korean Catholic church became a haven for those opposing Park Chung Hee&#x27;s policies. This was largely due to governmental agencies&#x27;, particularly the KCIA, reluctance to use military force against the church. The issues of democratization and evangelism were conflated, and some church leaders went so far as to lead protests against the authoritarian regime. The Minjung movement utilized theological arguments to support and legitimize the move towards a more democratic state. The model of Liberation Theology was viable in Korea due to the relatively high percentage of Koreans who practiced Christianity. (In 2005, approximately 1/3 of the Korean population claimed to be practicing Christians). The church provided a unique haven for anti-authoritarian dissent to develop.

== Movement influences ==

=== Kim Chiha ===
Born in the southwestern province of Cholla, Kim Chi-ha is known for being a critic that played a large role in the Pak regime. Participation in anti-government activities, resulted in his multiple arrests which granted him the time to write a satire in experimental pan&#x27;sori form, &quot;Five Bandits&quot; (). This poem expresses his opposition towards the corrupt authoritarian government. &quot;The poem condemned the five core power groups of the Pak regime - business tycoons, members of the National Assembly of South Korea (legislature), senior government officials, generals, and cabinet ministers - as &#x27;five bandits&#x27; who had brazenly acquired wealth by illicit means.&quot; As a result of the poem&#x27;s publication, Kim Chiha was arrested on the charge of &quot;abetting the propaganda lines&quot; of North Korea. In 1974, Kim Chiha was sentenced to death for violating the National Security Act and instigating rebellion. However, due to protesters such as Willy Brandt, Jean-Paul Sartre and Oe Kenzaburo, he was released in 1979.

=== Kim Dae-jung ===
One of the great leaders of the cause was Kim Dae-jung (or Kim Taejung), who stated that the economic development doesn&#x27;t have to come with sacrifice of democracy and political freedom. Kim Dae-jung is often described as &quot;a fierce and articulate critic, Kim castigated the government for abuses of power, corruption, and the social inequities created thereby and made an appeal for those who had not shared in the economic growth or who had been victimized by human rights violations.&quot; Fierce critics such as Kim Dae-jung won wide popularity with the people of South Korea. Such men with devotion to steer the nation into a democratic nation fueled the students and white collars to achieve what we call Minjung movement today. With significant efforts from Minjung, &quot;a mass movement for democracy, embracing students, workers, and many in the middle class, finally brought a democratic breakthrough in Korea.&quot;

Such powerful leaders like Kim Dae-jung pay a price for standing up for what they believe in. He was &quot;subjected to frequent political persecution and even targeted for assassination attempts&quot;. Through his devotion and criticism of an unfair government he was &quot;sentenced to death on a false charge&quot; which was later relieved through the United States. He still had to suffer by staying in jail for four years where he was under partial solitary confinement. Kim Dae-jung, undeterred, took advantage of his jail time to reflect and recharge. He worked through all the obstacles the government enforced such as &quot;being exiled to the United States&quot; and &quot;prohibited from engaging in political activities&quot;. Kim Dae-jung would not have the reputation of a fierce and one of the many great leaders if he had not kept fighting as he did. He ran for presidency three times and finally was elected in 1997 &quot;marking the first time an opposition party candidate had won a presidential election in South Korea&quot;.

==== Democracy ====
According to Kim Dae-jung, democracy is essential to the people of South Korea because it gives the people some sense of ownership over their nation. It gives them freedom and motivates them to defend it. Kim Dae-jung admits that because of Korean&#x27;s history and culture which was heavily influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, it is difficult for South Korea to adapt to Democracy. Democracy is an idea that was invented by the Western civilization. However, this instrument can be used in South Korea if the people of South Korea want to serve under the principles of democracy which is freedom, justice, and human dignity. Kim Dae-jung argues that South Korea does yearn for democracy. Even when you look at the history of the Tonghak Rebellion, this resistance occurred because the peasants wanted equality and less corruption. Even before South Korea became a democratic nation, the people wanted this political government.

Kim Dae-jung believes that the most ideal economic system for a democratic nation would be a free enterprise system. However, he argues that although South Korea claims to be a democratic nation with free enterprise, this nation does not follow its principles. There is no free competition. South Korea is filled with big corporations with monopolies that are protected by the government which eliminates all competition. Also, he argues that in a free enterprise system, society and government should be able to provide and protect the working class. He even goes on to say that &quot;the workers in our country are the other major role players&quot;. However, the authoritarian government abuses these workers and their freedom. They are treated unjustly and are not fairly rewarded. Also, there is no balance between the social classes. There is such a huge division between the higher class and the lower class which consists of farmers, workers, and small business men. In order for South Korea to break out of its shell, a balanced growth is necessary.

==== Presidential Inaugural Address: 1998 ====
Meanwhile, The infamous Asian financial crisis set forth in 1997, while the election was taking place. Foreign reserves were diminishing and economic issues such as high cost and low efficiency were threatening South Korea&#x27;s investors. In his presidential inaugural address in February 1998, Kim Dae-jung addressed the economic standpoint of the country at the time. Kim also emphasized the importance of Korea&#x27;s agriculture, farming, and foreign investments. Educational reform was highly encouraged and teaching future generations of societal values. He concluded by reflecting upon the thousands of years of heritage and fight for Korea&#x27;s difficulties thus far.

<text>O&#x27;Callaghan or simply Callaghan without the prefix (anglicized from two separate surnames and clans, &quot;Ó Ceallacháin,&quot; Munster Clan. &quot;Ó Ceileacháin,&quot; Oriel Clan&quot;)&quot; is an Irish surname.

==Origin and meaning==
===Munster===

The surname means descendant of Ceallachán who was the Eóganachta King of Munster from AD 935 until 954. The personal name Cellach means &#x27;bright-headed&#x27;. The principal Munster sept of the name Callaghan were lords of Cineál Aodha in South Cork originally. This area is west of Mallow along the Blackwater river valley. The family were dispossessed of their ancestral home and by the Cromwellian Plantation and settled in East Clare.

The O&#x27;Callaghan land near Mallow, forfeited by Donough O&#x27;Callaghan after the Irish rebellion of 1641, came into the hands of a family called Longfield or Longueville, who built a 20-bedroom Georgian mansion there. In a twist of history, of the ancient O&#x27;Callaghan land returned to O&#x27;Callaghan hands in the twentieth century, when Longueville House was bought by a descendant of Donough O&#x27;Callaghan. The ancestral estate of the O&#x27;Callaghans, now a luxury hotel, is owned by William O&#x27;Callaghan.

===Oriel===
An entirely different sept, Ó Ceileacháin in Irish, is to be found in the counties Armagh, Louth, Meath and Monaghan. It has been anglicised as Callaghan, Kelaghan, Keelaghan, Kealahan and other variants. In County Meath, where it is widespread but has been found mainly in the parishes of Kells, Trim and Athboy, it is mainly anglicised as Callahan, Callaghan or O&#x27;Callaghan (with local spelling variants). In County Westmeath it is found in the form Kellaghan and Kelleghan. In County Monaghan it is often found as Keelan.

Members of the Ó Ceileacháin family were mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters as being lords of Uí Breasail, a district on the southern shore of Lough Neagh, and priors of Armagh in the 11th century.

<text>Roman cursive (or Latin cursive) is a form of handwriting (or a script) used in ancient Rome and to some extent into the Middle Ages. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive and new cursive.

== Old Roman cursive ==
Old Roman cursive, also called majuscule cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even by emperors issuing commands. A more formal style of writing was based on Roman square capitals, but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. Most inscriptions at Pompeii, conserved due to being buried in a volcanic eruption in AD 79, are written in this script.

It is most commonly attested from the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD, but it likely existed earlier than that. The script uses many ligatures (see, e.g., Tironian notes), and some letters are hard to recognize – &quot;a&quot; looks like an uncial &quot;a&quot;, but with the left stroke still straight, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are hard to distinguish, &quot;e&quot; is a full height letter (like the &quot;s&quot;), &quot;p&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are very similar, and &quot;v&quot; is written above the baseline, resembling a floating breve. Many of the changes to the letters in Roman cursive were likely motivated by a desire to make the usage of ligatures easier. The letter &quot;b&quot; in Roman cursive contains a semicircular protuberance on its left side; this design feature may have been added in an attempt to conform to the needs of ligatures.

The distinctive writing style of Roman cursive emerged as the design of letters became simplified in colloquial contexts. Throughout the progression of Roman cursive, the number of strokes required to inscribe differing letters was significantly reduced. Roman cursive writing connected the strokes of differing letters to facilitate writing without lifting the writing utensil. The angles of standard letters were written as curves in Roman cursive due to ease of tracing curvatures with contemporary calligraphy tools. Curves in Roman cursive were smaller than curves in standard Latin calligraphy; this is likely because smaller curves are easier to trace than larger ones.

== New Roman cursive ==
During the 1st and 2nd centuries the style of formal Roman cursive experienced dramatic changes. Documents from this period contain innumerable versions of the Roman cursive letters; many documents contain different variations on cursive letters within the same text. This process continued until scribes had adopted a uniform, professional cursive script utilized by them around the 2nd to 3rd centuries. This more standardized style typically consisted of downward strokes followed by right-leaning upward strokes. Collectively, these characteristics gave the style a two-line pattern. Although common in professional writing, this style of cursive is not universal to all documents in Roman cursive. More informal documents still retained disorganized features and were unsuitable for ligatures. During the 3rd century, informal cursive styles almost completely replaced the scribal cursive, even in formal contexts. 

The informal style developed into a four-line script known as New Roman cursive, sometimes also called minuscule cursive or later Roman cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century. This style of cursive uses letterforms that are more recognizable to modern readers: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;e&quot; have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on the line. The right-leaning vertical strokes of New Roman cursive were rounder and longer than similar strokes found in Old Roman Cursive. Although there were a smaller number of ligature combinations in New Roman cursive, some new ligature styles emerged by imposing the characteristics of one letter onto another. Letters had short lines extending horizontally towards the next letter.

These letter forms would gradually evolve into various scripts with a more regional character by the 7th century, such as the Visigothic script in Spain, the Beneventan script in southern Italy, or the Merovingian script in northern France. They also formed part of the basis of the uncial and half-uncial scripts, particularly for the letters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;s&quot;, which in turn are the basis for Gaelic type.

<text>The lesson of the widow&#x27;s mite or the widow&#x27;s offering is presented in two of the Synoptic Gospels ( and ), when Jesus is teaching in the Temple in Jerusalem. The Gospel of Mark specifies that two &quot;mites&quot; (Greek ) are together worth a &quot;quadrans&quot;, the smallest Roman coin. A &quot;lepton&quot; was the smallest and least valuable coin in circulation in Judea, worth about six minutes of an average daily wage.

==Biblical narrative==

==Interpretation==

The traditional interpretation of this story tends to view it as contrasting the conduct of the scribes with that of the widow, and encouraging generous giving; it is often read with 2 Corinthians 9:7, &quot;... for God loves a cheerful giver&quot;.

The account of the widow&#x27;s offering is often used by some churches to encourage the faithful to follow her example and make large offerings, despite a precarious situation. Various theologians have criticized this interpretation. They connect this story with Jesus&#x27; condemnation of religious leaders devouring the houses of widows in the preceding verse (Gospel according to Luke, chapter 20). Thus Jesus would not have wanted to show the example of a generous donor, but rather to denounce a case of injustice.

However, Addison Wright observes that there is no indication given of the widow&#x27;s demeanor or frame of mind. He points out that earlier, in Mark 7:10-13, Jesus takes to task the scribes and Pharisees for a hypocrisy that would impoverish parents.

For Moses said, &#x27;Honor your father and your mother,&#x27; and &#x27;Whoever curses father or mother shall die.&#x27; Yet you say, &#x27;If a person says to father or mother, &quot;Any support you might have had from me is qorban&quot;&#x27; (meaning, dedicated to God), you allow him to do nothing more for his father or mother. You nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many such things.&quot; 
In the passage immediately prior to Jesus taking a seat opposite the Temple treasury, he is portrayed as condemning religious leaders who feign piety, accept honor from people, and steal from widows. &quot;Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes and accept greetings in the marketplaces, seats of honor in synagogues, and places of honor at banquets. &quot;They devour the houses of widows&quot; and, as a pretext, recite lengthy prayers. They will receive a very severe condemnation.&quot;

The same religious leaders who would reduce widows to poverty also encourage them to make pious donations beyond their means. In Wright&#x27;s opinion, rather than commending the widow&#x27;s generosity, Jesus is condemning both the social system that renders her poor, and &quot;... the value system that motivates her action, and he condemns the people who conditioned her to do it.&quot; Elizabeth Struthers Malbon concludes that Wright&#x27;s interpretation is &quot;more ingenious than convincing.&quot;

Quentin Quesnell sees in this account &quot;... a rebuke and rejection of the wrongdoers.&quot; Quesnell notes that if Jesus&#x27; statement was to be seen as an endorsement of the widow&#x27;s action, it bears none of the usual comments, such as &quot;Go, and do likewise.&quot;

The account of the Widow&#x27;s Mite is followed by, &quot;As he was making his way out of the temple area one of his disciples said to him, &quot;Look, teacher, what stones and what buildings!&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Do you see these great buildings? There will not be one stone left upon another that will not be thrown down.&quot;

Wright notes the irony that as the Temple was destroyed in the year 70, the widow&#x27;s gift was not only misguided, but for nothing.

Justus Knecht gives a common moral lesson from the widow&#x27;s mites:

&quot;Good Intentions.&quot; From the words of our Lord spoken in praise of the poor widow, we learn that in our good works everything depends upon the intention. The widow had given more than all the rich; for she parted with her whole fortune. She intended to give all she had to God. This was an act of perfect love and sacrifice.
==The King James Bible translation==
In Jesus&#x27; times in Judea, the small copper coin was called a &quot;lepton&quot;; there was no coin called by the English term &quot;mite&quot; at that time. However, there was a &quot;mite&quot; in the time of the creation of the King James Bible, as indeed there had been at the time of earliest modern English translation of the New Testament by William Tyndale in 1525. The denomination was well known in the Southern Netherlands. Both the duke of Brabant and the count of Flanders issued them and they were sometimes imitated in the North. English poet Geoffrey Chaucer refers to the &quot;myte&quot; in his unfinished poem &quot;Anelida and Arcite&quot; (c. 1370). Originally, the Brabant mijt (&quot;maille&quot; in French) was 1/76 stuiver, the Flemish mijt 1/48 stuiver. When the two areas were united under the dukes of Burgundy and later under the Habsburgs, the rate of the mijt was set at 1/32 stuiver. More important, they were the very smallest copper coins. By 1611, they were no longer minted, but they were still in circulation.

<doc id="1103700" wikidata="Q5503050" url="?curid=1103700" title="Freshfield">
<text>Freshfield is an area of Formby, in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England, situated at the northern end of the town. It has no local political distinction or representation and is included as part of the two council wards which make up Formby (Harington and Ravenmeols), nor is it any longer separated in a physical sense from the town.

The area is often considered to be affluent with local celebrities, footballers, politicians and businessmen making it their home (see people from Formby). Shireburn Road in Freshfield is the most expensive road in Merseyside, house prices on the exclusive road averaged £1,159,831 in 2009.

==History==
The name did not exist until Formby&#x27;s second railway station, Freshfield, was built in 1854. The name was chosen, as the local landowner, Thomas Fresh, owned the adjacent model farm and fields. Fresh was Inspector of Nuisances in Liverpool and was one of the celebrated trio of pioneering officers appointed in 1847 by the Borough of Liverpool&#x27;s Health of the Town Committee; the others being William Henry Duncan, the UK&#x27;s first medical officer of health, and James Newlands, borough engineer (though Fresh had been in a similar post for more than two years previously).

A process of reverse naming seems to have occurred with some people referring to the area of Formby around this station as &quot;Freshfield&quot;. The title originally proposed was &quot;Freshton&quot;.

==Governance==
Until 1974, Freshfield was part of the urban district of Formby within the administrative county of Lancashire. Since 1 April 1974, it has formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, in Merseyside.

From 1950 until 2010 Freshfield like the rest of Formby formed part of the constituency of Crosby, The MP for Crosby from 1997 until 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party, prior to her election the seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of the Crosby constituency being abolished for the 2010 general election, Freshfield like the rest of Formby is part of the newly created Sefton Central constituency represented by Bill Esterson, a member of the Labour Party.

For elections to Sefton Council, Freshfield is divided between two electoral wards with three councillors each: Harington ward, whose councillors are Peter Harvey (Labour), Carol Richards (Labour) and Joe Riley (Conservative); and Ravenmeols ward, whose councillors are Catie Page (Labour), Christopher Page (Labour) and Nina Killen (Labour).

==Community==
The area contains The Freshfield and The Grapes pubs, Victoria Hall and Victoria Road (a long avenue on which several famous English sportsmen have lived). RAF Woodvale is nearby.

==Transport==
Freshfield railway station is situated on the Liverpool to Southport branch of Merseyrail&#x27;s Northern Line.

==Formby Woods==
Located nearby is a section of the Mersey Forest, known as Formby Woods, a community forest known for being a habitat of rare red squirrels, with a reserve managed by the National Trust.

<text>All Ages is a compilation album by the American punk rock band Bad Religion. It was released on July 26, 1995, through Epitaph Records. The compilation contains songs from &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; to &quot;Generator&quot;, and two live tracks recorded during their 1994 European tour, which were the first tracks to feature guitarist Brian Baker.

==Background==
&quot;All Ages&quot; contains material from five of Bad Religion&#x27;s first six studio albums released on Epitaph, omitting songs from the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;. It also contains no tracks from the &quot;Bad Religion&quot; and &quot;Back to the Known&quot; EPs. The band had left Epitaph for Atlantic in 1993, where they reissued &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; and began to experience major worldwide commercial success.

The live tracks &quot;Do What You Want&quot; and &quot;Fuck Armageddon... This Is Hell&quot; were recorded live at the Karen Klub in Goteborg, Sweden, on October 8, 1994, on Bad Religion&#x27;s &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; tour. These tracks were the first to feature guitarist Brian Baker, who had replaced Brett Gurewitz before the release of &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;.

<doc id="1103704" wikidata="Q5882381" url="?curid=1103704" title="Hollyford Track">
<text>The Hollyford Track is a tramping track in New Zealand. Located at the northern edge of Fiordland, in the southwestern South Island, it is unusual among Fiordland&#x27;s major tracks in that it is largely flat and accessible year-round. It follows the Hollyford River which in turn follows the course of the Hollyford Valley.

==History==
The Māori people were the first to settle the area around Martins Bay, though by the time of the arrival of Europeans in the mid-19th century, only a handful remained in the area. One of these was Tūtoko, for whom Mount Tūtoko, which rises 2700m above the Hollyford valley, was subsequently named.

he first Europeans to reach the bay via an inland route was Patrick Caples from Hollyford County Tipperary Ireland in 1863, although early David McKellar and George Gunn had mapped some of the valley two years previously. Also in 1863, a small ship captained by a Captain Alabaster crossed the sandbar at Martins Bay to reach Lake McKerrow.

In the early days of European settlement, there was much enthusiasm for a commercial port at Martins Bay, led by the Otago Provincial Council. A settlement – Jamestown – was surveyed and several houses built, but the lack of road links to the rest of the province and the dangerous sandbar led to the gradual waning of the settlement, which was practically deserted by 1879, only some eleven years after its founding. Only one family, the McKenzies, remained close to Martins Bay. They sold their property to Davy Gunn in 1926. Gunn continued to farm the area, and also mapped the area and was a pioneer in the tramping tourism industry, taking parties of walkers along the valleys of the Hollyford, Pyke and Cascade Rivers. After his death in 1955, his son Murray continued to guide trampers in the area, and started &quot;Gunn&#x27;s Camp&quot;, a rest-stop for trampers with store and small museum, which still stands near the southern end of the track, around 10 km from the Milford Sound-Te Anau highway.

The gravel road was being constructed up until 1941 when the workers were taken off the job for the war effort and was worked on both ends. After World War II the idea of a road linking Haast to Hollyford was reignited to allow access and used prison and unemployed labor to progress the work. In 1960, the valley became part of Fiordland National Park and Davy Gunn&#x27;s original tracks have since been upgraded and tramping huts established.

==The track==
The track is in length. It runs in a roughly south–north direction, its southern end being accessible by road 15 kilometres to the east of the Homer Tunnel, and its northern end being at the Tasman Sea coast at Martins Bay, north of Milford Sound.

For most of its path, the track follows the course of the Hollyford River / Hollyford Valley. Features of the track are the two lakes, Lake Alabaster (or &quot;Waiwahuika&quot;) and Lake McKerrow (or &quot;Whakatipu Waitai&quot;), the latter being a fiord now cut off from the sea by sediment. The track runs through lowland forest, with views of surrounding mountains. Wildlife visible from the track include seals, penguins, and herons.

The track is part of the Department of Conservation network with several bunk huts scattered along its length. It also has a guided operation operated by Ngai Tahu Tourism (owned by the main South Island Maori tribal group) with their own Lodges at Pyke and Martins Bay. 
The guided option combines hiking, jetboating and helicopter flights in a three-day journey from the mountains to the sea. 
Freedom walkers can make the walk more accessible by flying into or out of Martins Bay. Walkers are advised to be aware that the 2–3 day section from the Pyke River to Martins Bay alongside Lake McKerrow is well known as the &#x27;Demon Trail&#x27;. This due to its uneven nature with multiple side streams. The Demon trail is aptly named and can be slippery in the wet.

==Road proposals==

There have been a number of proposals for a road in the vicinity of the track to link Haast with the Milford Sound road, proposed as early as the 1870s.

In 2001 a widely distributed newspaper advertising supplement &quot;The South Island Loop&quot; promoted the Hollyford road as well as a road in the vicinity of the Heaphy Track. Mayors in the South Island and other supporters pushed for having the road built. Forest and Bird, New Zealand&#x27;s largest conservation organisation, called it the &quot;biological equivalent of smashing the Mona Lisa&quot;. In January 2010, the National-led government confirmed that it was considering a Hollyford road proposal. The Westland District Council and the owner of a hotel chain are backing plans for the road. The plans were however put on hold in March 2010, when government decided that the investment was a low priority.

<doc id="1103715" wikidata="Q1187726" url="?curid=1103715" title="2002 World Series">
<text>The 2002 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB)&#x27;s 2002 season. The 98th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Anaheim Angels and the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants; the Angels defeated the Giants, four games to three, to win their first, and, to date, only World Series championship. The series was played from October 19–27, 2002, at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco and Edison International Field of Anaheim in Anaheim.

This was the first World Series since the 1995 inception of the wild card in MLB (and the last until ) in which both wild card teams would vie for the title. The Angels finished the regular season in second place in the AL West division. They defeated the four-time defending AL champion New York Yankees, three games to one, in the best-of-five AL Division Series, and in doing so won their first postseason series in franchise history. They then defeated the Minnesota Twins, four games to one, in the best-of-seven AL Championship Series to advance to the World Series, another first in franchise history. The Giants finished the regular season in second place in the NL West division. They defeated the Atlanta Braves in the NL Division Series and the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series to advance to the World Series, giving the team their 20th NL pennant and 17th appearance in the Fall Classic but only their third since moving from New York City to San Francisco in 1958.

The series was the fourth World Series played between two teams from California, after , , and , and the latest Fall Classic that featured teams from the same city or state (since 2000 between cross-town rivals Mets and Yankees). Barry Bonds, Reggie Sanders, and J. T. Snow each hit home runs to help propel the Giants to win Game one. Game two was a high-scoring affair that the Angels ultimately won on Tim Salmon&#x27;s eighth-inning home run. The Angels routed the Giants in Game three, but lost Game four on a tie-breaking eighth-inning single by the Giants&#x27; David Bell. The Giants brought the Angels to the brink of elimination by winning Game five in a blowout. The Giants were eight outs away from winning the Series in Game six, but late game home runs by Scott Spiezio and Darin Erstad, as well as a two-RBI double by Troy Glaus helped the Angels overcome a five-run, seventh-inning deficit to win. A three-run double by Garret Anderson was the difference in the Angels&#x27; Game seven win to clinch the series. Glaus was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. The two teams set a record for combined most home runs in a World Series (21), which stood until 2017.

==Background==

This was the fourth World Series played between two teams from California and the last World Series as of today involving two teams from the same state (since 2000 between cross-town rivals New York Mets and New York Yankees). The 1974 World Series saw the Oakland Athletics defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers; the series saw the Los Angeles Dodgers getting revenge by defeating the Oakland Athletics. In the San Francisco Giants were defeated by the Oakland Athletics. The managers of the two clubs, Mike Scioscia of the Angels and Dusty Baker of the Giants, were teammates on the Dodgers from 1980 to 1983, and won a World Series in . This was the first World Series to feature opposing managers who had been teammates on a World Championship team as players.

===San Francisco Giants===
Since their 1958 move from New York City to San Francisco, the Giants franchise and its fans had a long history of futility, frustration, and disappointment. The Giants had won their last World Series crown before the move, in . Since the move, the Giants made it to the World Series twice but lost both times. These included a dramatic, down-to-the-wire loss to the New York Yankees in the seven-game classic 1962 World Series, and a four-game sweep by their crosstown rival Oakland Athletics in the 1989 World Series that was marred by the Loma Prieta earthquake. Their most recent postseason appearance was in 2000, when they were defeated by the New York Mets in the NLDS. In addition, the Giants narrowly missed winning the National League pennant in 1959, 1964, 1965 and 1966. They finished in second place five years in a row from 1965 to 1969 and lost the 1971 National League Championship Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates.

2002 was Dusty Baker&#x27;s tenth season as manager of the Giants. It was also their third season playing at Pacific Bell Park (now Oracle Park). The Giants finished the previous season with a record of 90–72, finishing in second place in the National League West, two games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks. They also finished in second place in the NL wild card standings, three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals. Notable player departures included 2001 midseason acquisition Andrés Galarraga, who departed as a free agent, and Shawn Estes, who was traded to the New York Mets in exchange for Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Desi Relaford. Notable player acquisitions included Reggie Sanders, a free agent, and David Bell, who the Giants received from the Seattle Mariners in exchange for Desi Relaford and cash. During the season the Giants also acquired Kenny Lofton from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for two minor leaguers. Sanders, Bell, Shinjo, and Lofton helped bolster a Giants offense led by longtime Giants Barry Bonds, J. T. Snow, Rich Aurilia, and Jeff Kent, as well as relative newcomer Benito Santiago. The starting pitching rotation was led by Kirk Rueter and Jason Schmidt, with a bullpen led by Tim Worrell and closer Robb Nen.

During the 2002 regular season, the Giants led the NL West standings for most of April and a few days in May; however, by the end of May they had fallen to third place behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks. They spent most of the next three months in third place, but on September 9 they took second place for good, while the Dodgers either tied them or fell to third place for the rest of the season. The Giants finished the regular season with a record of 95–66, games behind the NL West champion Diamondbacks. They won the NL wild card, games ahead of the runner-up Dodgers.

In the 2002 postseason, the wild-card Giants&#x27; first opponent was the top-seeded Atlanta Braves, who they defeated in five games to return to the NLCS for the first time since 1989. In the NLCS, the Giants defeated the #3 seed St. Louis Cardinals in five games to advance to the World Series for the 17th time in franchise history. Dusty Baker became the first black manager to participate in a World Series since Cito Gaston for Toronto in and .

This was Giants&#x27; outfielder Reggie Sanders&#x27; second consecutive World Series appearance with different teams—in he got there with the Arizona Diamondbacks. This was the first time this happened since Don Baylor did it in three consecutive years with the Boston Red Sox in , the Minnesota Twins in , and with the Oakland Athletics in .

===Anaheim Angels===
Like the Giants, the Angels and their fans carried a long history of futility and disappointment. Enfranchised in 1961, the Angels had never before played in the World Series. They came close several times, including ALCS losses in 1979 to the Baltimore Orioles, 1982 to the Milwaukee Brewers, and in 1986 to the Boston Red Sox. After dropping the 1979 ALCS in four games, the Angels brought their opponents to the brink of elimination in each of those last two series, before losing the next three consecutive games and the series. The 1986 ALCS, in which the Angels were as close as 1 strike away from the World Series, was the Angels&#x27; latest postseason appearance, though they came close in 1995 when they lost a one-game tie-breaker for the AL West championship to the Seattle Mariners after blowing a 14-game lead in the standings.

2002 was the Angels&#x27; third season under manager Mike Scioscia. The Angels finished the previous injury marred season with a record of 75–87, finishing in third place in the AL West. The most notable personnel change during the offseason was the trade of first baseman Mo Vaughn to the New York Mets in exchange for pitcher Kevin Appier. Offensively, the team was led by longtime Angels Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad, Troy Glaus and Tim Salmon, as well as relative newcomers Adam Kennedy and David Eckstein. The starting pitching rotation was led by Ramón Ortiz and Jarrod Washburn, as well as mid-season call-up John Lackey, while the bullpen was led by setup man Brendan Donnelly and closer Troy Percival. The bullpen was bolstered in late September by the addition of 20-year-old reliever prospect Francisco Rodriguez.

The Angels spent much of the season trailing the first-place Seattle Mariners and on occasion the Oakland Athletics in the AL West standings. However, the Athletics and Angels both mounted late-season comebacks that, coupled with a poor August record for the Mariners, knocked the Mariners down to third place. The Athletics won 20 straight games at one point, and the Angels finished the season in second place with a 99–63 record, four games behind the Athletics, but won the AL wild card, six games ahead of the Boston Red Sox and Seattle Mariners. Their 99 wins was third best in the A.L. and fourth best in baseball.

In the 2002 postseason, the wild-card Angels first faced off against the overall #1 seed and four-time defending American League champion New York Yankees in the ALDS. The Angels shocked the four-time defending AL champions in four games to return to the ALCS for the first time since 1986. Their opponent in the ALCS was the third-seeded Minnesota Twins, who they defeated in five games to advance to the World Series for the first time in franchise history.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
San Francisco won 4–3 at Edison International Field of Anaheim (now Angel Stadium of Anaheim) to take a 1–0 series lead. As he strode into the batter&#x27;s box to open the second inning, Barry Bonds was finally making his first (and only) World Series appearance; in his first at bat on a 2–1 pitch from Angels starter Jarrod Washburn, Bonds smoked a line drive for a home run to right field, which gave the Giants a quick 1–0 lead. Reggie Sanders then followed that up with an opposite-field homer later in the inning. With the Giants leading 2–1 in the fifth, Giants batter J. T. Snow (who formerly played for the Angels) hit a two-run shot over the center field wall after Sanders singled to give San Francisco a three-run advantage. Eventual Series MVP Troy Glaus hit two home runs for the Angels, one in the second and another in the sixth off Giants starter Jason Schmidt. Adam Kennedy drove in a run with a base hit in the sixth as well to trim the deficit to 4–3. However, Schmidt was effective otherwise, along with reliever Félix Rodríguez and closer Robb Nen, as they held off the Halos the rest of the way.
===Game 2===

Game 2 was a slugfest that saw the lead fluctuate wildly between the two teams. The Angels plated five runs in the first inning by batting around against Giants starting pitcher Russ Ortiz. David Eckstein singled to lead off and scored on Darin Erstad&#x27;s double. After Tim Salmon singled, Garret Anderson&#x27;s RBI single made it 2–0 Angels. After Troy Glaus flew out, consecutive RBI singles by Brad Fullmer and Scott Spiezio made it 4–0 Angels. Fullmer stole home plate for the Angels&#x27; fifth run of the inning.

In the second inning, however, Kevin Appier surrendered most of the lead by allowing a three-run homer to Sanders followed by a shot to David Bell. The Angels answered with a two-run home run from veteran Tim Salmon to make it 7–4 in the Angels&#x27; favor. Ortiz would not finish the inning and was relieved by Chad Zerbe, who provided four innings of relief.

Appier did not last much longer than Ortiz, as he was pulled in the third and replaced by John Lackey, the Angels scheduled starter for Game 4, after surrendering a lead-off home run to Jeff Kent. Lackey temporarily quieted the Giants&#x27; offense but ran into trouble in the fifth inning, allowing a double and intentional walk. Ben Weber relieved him but allowed a single to Benito Santiago to load the bases, then a two-run single to J. T. Snow that tied the game. After Reggie Sanders struck out, consecutive RBI singles by David Bell and Shawon Dunston gave the Giants a 9–7 lead.

The Angels turned to 20-year-old rookie reliever Francisco Rodriguez, who answered by shutting down the Giants offense for the next three innings. He retired nine batters in a row on 25 pitches (22 were strikes). Meanwhile, the Angels chipped away at their deficit. In the bottom of the fifth, Glaus and Fullmer hit back-to-back leadoff singles before the former scored on Spezio&#x27;s sacrifice fly. Next inning, Erstad doubled with two outs. Zerbe was relieved by Jay Witasick, who walked Tim Salmon. Aaron Fultz relieved Witasick and allowed an RBI single to Anderson to tie the game, but Salmon was thrown out at third to end the inning.

Salmon drilled a two-run home run with two outs in the eighth inning off of Félix Rodríguez, giving Anaheim an 11–9 lead. Closer Troy Percival retired the first two batters in the ninth, and, after allowing a mammoth shot from Bonds that landed halfway up the right field bleachers, retired Benito Santiago to even the series.
Bonds became the first player since Ted Simmons in the 1982 World Series to hit a home run in his first two World Series games, joining Simmons, Dusty Rhodes in the 1954 World Series and Jimmie Foxx in the 1929 World Series. The feat would later be duplicated by Craig Monroe of the Tigers in the 2006 World Series.

Giants pitchers failed to strike out a batter for the entire game, the first time this had happened in the World Series since Game 7 of the 1960 World Series; as of 2021 it remains the last time a team has not recorded a strikeout in a World Series game.
The Angels won despite giving up four home runs to the Giants, compared to two by the Angels.

Earlier in the day, the Los Angeles Galaxy won MLS Cup and the Angels would later in the World Series a couple of days later, which meant the Angels and Galaxy were the first MLB and MLS champions from the same metropolitan area within the same season.

===Game 3===
Anaheim won 10–4 in the first World Series game at Pacific Bell Park (now Oracle Park). The Angels batted around twice without a home run in either of their four-run innings. They became the first team in World Series history to bat around in consecutive innings. Barry Bonds hit another home run, becoming the first player to homer in his first three World Series games.

The Giants struck first on Benito Santiago&#x27;s based-loaded groundout in the first off of Ramón Ortiz, but Giants starter Liván Hernández walked David Eckstein to lead off the third and allowed a subsequent double to Darin Erstad. An error on Tim Salmon&#x27;s groundball allowed Eckstein to score. After Garret Anderson flew out, Troy Glaus hit an RBI single and Scott Spiezio followed with a two-run triple. Next inning, Anderson&#x27;s RBI groundout with runners on second and third chased Hernandez. Jay Witasick entered in relief and walked Glaus before allowing RBI singles to Spiezio, Adam Kennedy and Bengie Molina, which increased Anaheim&#x27;s lead to 8–1. Rich Aurilia hit a one-out home run in the fifth for the Giants. After Jeff Kent singled, Bonds&#x27;s home run made it 8–4, but the Giants did not score after that. The Angels added to their lead on Eckstein&#x27;s RBI single in the sixth off of Aaron Fultz and Erstad&#x27;s bases-loaded fielder&#x27;s choice in the eighth off of Scott Eyre.

Giants public address announcer Renel Brooks-Moon is recognized by the Baseball Hall of Fame as the first female announcer of a championship game in any professional sport for her role in the 2002 World Series. Her scorecard from Game 3 is on display in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Until 2014, this game was the Giants&#x27; only World Series loss at home since Pacific Bell Park opened in 2000. They proceeded to win the final two games in this series, then won four straight home games in their next two World Series appearances in 2010 and 2012 until finally losing at home in Game 3 in 2014.
===Game 4===
The Angels struck first in the second on David Eckstein&#x27;s bases-loaded sacrifice fly, then made it 3–0 next inning on Troy Glaus&#x27;s two-run home run off of starter Kirk Rueter. In the bottom of the fifth, however, Angels starter John Lackey allowed three consecutive leadoff singles, the last of which by Rich Aurilia scoring Rueter. Jeff Kent&#x27;s sacrifice fly cut the Angels&#x27; lead to 3–2 and NLCS MVP Benito Santiago tied the game with a single in after the Angels walked Barry Bonds with a runner on second and two outs. David Bell put the Giants ahead with an RBI single in the bottom of the eighth off of Francisco Rodriguez. The run was unearned, due to Anaheim catcher Bengie Molina&#x27;s passed ball during the previous at-bat, allowing J. T. Snow to move to second. Tim Worrell got the win for the Giants. San Francisco scored a 4–3 victory to tie the series and ensured a return trip to Anaheim.
===Game 5===
San Francisco took a 16–4 blowout win in a game in which the Angels never led. The most well-known moment in this game occurred in the bottom of the seventh when Giants first baseman J. T. Snow scored off a Kenny Lofton triple. Three-year-old batboy Darren, son of Giants manager Dusty Baker, ran to home plate to collect Lofton&#x27;s bat before the play was completed and was quickly lifted by the jacket by Snow with one hand as he crossed the plate, with David Bell close on his heels. Had Snow not acted quickly, Darren could have been seriously injured in a play at home plate.

Giants&#x27; second-baseman Jeff Kent hit two home runs to break out of a slump (hitting his first home run since Game 2), driving in four runs.

In the bottom of the first, Barry Bonds&#x27;s double off of Jarrod Washburn with runners on first and second gave the Giants an early lead. Benito Santiago&#x27;s sacrifice fly, followed by three consecutive walks made it 3–0 Giants. Next inning, Benito&#x27;s bases-loaded single scored two and Reggie Sanders&#x27;s sacrifice fly scored another. Orlando Palmeiro doubled to lead off the top of the fifth, moved to third on David Eckstein&#x27;s single and scored on Darin Erstad&#x27;s sacrifice fly. After Tim Salmon singled, a wild pitch by starter Jason Schmidt allowed Eckstein to score. After Garret Anderson struck out, Troy Glaus&#x27;s RBI double cut the Giants&#x27; lead to 6–3. The Angels cut it to 6–4 next inning off of Chad Zerbe on Eckstein&#x27;s groundout with runners on second and third, but did not score again. Kent&#x27;s two-run home run in the bottom half off of Ben Weber widened the Giants&#x27; lead to 8–4. Next inning, Kenny Lofton&#x27;s two-run triple made it 10-4 Giants. Scot Shields relieved Weber and after Aurilia struck out, Kent&#x27;s second home run of the game made it 12–4 Giants. Next inning, Shields allowed consecutive one-out singles to J. T. Snow and David Bell, then an error on Tsuyoshi Shinjo&#x27;s ground ball made it 13–4 Giants. After Lofton grounded out, Aurilia capped the scoring with a three-run home run. Scott Eyre retired the Angels in order in the ninth as the Giants were one win away from a World Series title. Chad Zerbe earned the win for the Giants.

This game shares one peculiar record with Game 2 of the 1960 World Series. The two games share the World Series record for most runs scored by a game winning team who ultimately went on to lose the series.
===Game 6===
The turning point in the Series came in Game 6. Following the top of the seventh inning, the Giants led 5–0 but then proceeded to surrender three runs in the bottom of the inning and another three runs in the bottom of the eighth inning and lost the game 6–5.

The game was scoreless through the first four innings. In the top of the fifth, San Francisco took the lead. David Bell singled with one out, then Shawon Dunston&#x27;s home run made it 2–0 Giants. After Kenny Lofton doubled, Francisco Rodríguez relieved Kevin Appier. Lofton stole third and scored on a wild pitch. In the top of the sixth, Barry Bonds homered off Rodriguez to make it 4–0, and the Giants added another run in the top of the seventh when Lofton singled and stole second and was driven in by a single by Jeff Kent.

Leading 5–0 with one out in the bottom of the seventh inning, eight outs away from the Giants&#x27; first World Series title since moving to San Francisco in 1958, Giants manager Dusty Baker pulled starting pitcher Russ Ortiz, who had shut out the Angels during the game, for setup man Félix Rodríguez after Ortiz gave up consecutive singles to third baseman Troy Glaus and designated hitter Brad Fullmer. In a move noted in later years, Baker gave Ortiz the game ball as he sent him back to the dugout, as Ortiz wanted a souvenir ball (contrary to some belief, the Angels did not see the move in real time). During the pitching change the Rally Monkey came on the JumboTron, sending 45,037 Angels fans into a frenzy.

Angels first baseman Scott Spiezio then fouled off pitch after pitch before finally hitting a three-run home run that barely cleared the wall in right field. Ortiz would be charged with two runs and a no-decision, his second of the series. The rally continued in the eighth inning, as Angels center fielder Darin Erstad hit a leadoff line-drive home run, followed by consecutive singles by Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson. When Bonds misplayed Anderson&#x27;s shallow left field bloop single, Chone Figgins (who had pinch-run for Salmon) and Anderson took third and second base, respectively. With no outs, two runners in scoring position and now only a 5–4 lead, Baker brought in closer Robb Nen to pitch to Glaus, hoping that Nen could induce a strikeout that might yet preserve the Giants&#x27; slim lead; prior to that game, he was seven of seven in postseason saves that year despite dealing with a shoulder injury. However, Glaus slugged a double to the left-center field gap over Bonds&#x27; head to drive in the tying and go-ahead runs and giving Nen a blown save. Nen managed to keep Glaus from scoring before leaving the game, which ended up being his final appearance as a major league player.

In the ninth inning, Angels closer Troy Percival struck out Tom Goodwin, induced a foul popout from Lofton, and struck out Rich Aurilia to preserve the 6–5 victory in front of the jubilant home crowd. The comeback from a five-run deficit was the largest in World Series history for an elimination game. No other team overcame a five-run deficit to win a World Series game until Game 1 of the 2022 World Series, when the Philadelphia Phillies did so against the Houston Astros. That Astros team, like the Giants, was managed by Dusty Baker. The Los Angeles Dodgers also overcame a 5-run deficit in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees to clinch the series, 4 games to 1.

This game ranked number 2 as ESPN&#x27;s Game of the Year in 2002.

===Game 7===
Game 7 proved to be somewhat anticlimactic after the drama of Game 6. The Giants scored the first run in the top of the second inning when Reggie Sanders hit a sacrifice fly to score Benito Santiago from third (after back-to-back singles from Santiago and J.T. Snow), but the Angels responded with a run-scoring double from catcher Bengie Molina that scored Scott Spiezio from first after he had walked with two outs. In the bottom of the third, David Eckstein and Darin Erstad led off with back-to-back singles and Tim Salmon was hit in his hand by a pitch to load the bases with no outs (Salmon would later leave the game due to the injury, being replaced by Alex Ochoa). Left fielder Garret Anderson then hit a bases-clearing three-run double to push the Angels to a 4–1 lead and gave San Francisco starter Liván Hernández the loss. Hernández was yanked after walking Troy Glaus to put two on, but Chad Zerbe got out of the nightmarish inning. Zerbe, Kirk Rueter, and Tim Worrell held the Angels scoreless for the rest of the game, allowing only one hit, but it was not enough. Rookie starting pitcher John Lackey maintained that lead through five innings, and turned the game over to the strong Angels bullpen. In the ninth inning, closer Troy Percival provided some tense moments. J.T. Snow led off with a single and was forced out at second by Tom Goodwin. Goodwin then stole second as David Bell walked, putting two men on with only one out and the tying run at the plate. But Tsuyoshi Shinjo—the first Japanese-born player in a World Series game—struck out swinging, and Kenny Lofton, also representing the tying run, flied out to Darin Erstad in right-center field to end the Series. The Angels won Game 7, 4–1, to claim their franchise&#x27;s first and only World Series championship to date. John Lackey became the first rookie pitcher to win a World Series Game 7 since 1909. In Game 7, three rookie pitchers (John Lackey, Brendan Donnelly, and Francisco Rodríguez) combined to throw eight innings while only giving up one run combined.

The Angels won the World Series despite scoring fewer runs (41) than the Giants (44). The Angels lost the first game in all three rounds of the playoffs (Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series), yet rebounded to win each time. They were the first, and to date only, team to do this since the new postseason format was created in 1994.

Until 2017, this was the last time a franchise would win its first World Series title. It was also the second year in a row that the feat had been accomplished; in 2001, the Diamondbacks beat the Yankees in just their fourth year of existence. Also in those two years, both teams won the World Series in just their first appearance, which did not happen again until 2019, when the Washington Nationals would accomplish the feat.

The Angels became the first American League (AL) champion team not representing the AL East Division to win the World Series since the Minnesota Twins in 1991. The Angels were also the first American League Wild Card winner to win the World Series. With this win the Angels got rid of the supposed curse on their head stemming from Anaheim Stadium being built on an ancient Indian burial ground.

==Composite box==
2002 World Series (4–3): Anaheim Angels (A.L.) over San Francisco Giants (N.L.)
==Series overview and aftermath==
The Angels and the Giants combined to log 85 runs over the course of the series, the largest combined run total for both teams in World Series history. This remains the most recent World Series that was played entirely within one state. There would not be another postseason match-up between two California teams until the 2020 National League Division Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, which took place at neutral site (Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas) due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

This was the last World Series where home-field advantage alternated between the National and American Leagues each year. As a result of the tie in the 2002 All-Star Game, beginning in 2003 home-field advantage in the World Series was controversially granted to the league that won the All-Star Game. That practice ended after the 2016 Series; beginning in 2017, the team with the better regular season record will enjoy home field advantage, the same format used in the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Finals and National Hockey League&#x27;s Stanley Cup Finals.

Following the Darren Baker incident in game 5, MLB changed their rules requiring batboys and batgirls be at least 14 years old.

This is currently the earliest World Series in which no personnel from either team have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

===Angels===
Just before the start of the 2003 season, the Walt Disney Company sold the Angels for $180 million to businessman Arte Moreno. Nevertheless, the 2002 World Series win began the most successful era in Angels franchise history, making six postseason appearances from 2002 to 2009. Before 2002, they had been to the postseason three times in franchise history (1979, 1982, and 1986). They advanced to the ALCS in 2005 and 2009, but lost those series respectively to the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees, each while en route to their own World Series championship. The Angels were the most recent team to win the championship in its first World Series appearance until the Washington Nationals accomplished the feat in ; between 2002 and 2019, all first-time World Series participants would lose—the Houston Astros in , Colorado Rockies in , Tampa Bay Rays in , and Texas Rangers in .

The Angels were the last of four Los Angeles area teams to win a championship in 2002, with the Lakers, Sparks, and Galaxy all winning a title in their respective leagues prior. It was the first time ever four teams in the same metropolitan area won a championship within the same season. The seven days between the Galaxy&#x27;s Cup win and the Angels&#x27; World Series was the shortest was the shortest timespan for two championships in the same metro area.

The Angels would sparingly use the Rally Monkey mascot after the 2002 World Series and unofficially retired it after the 2009 postseason.

Both David Eckstein and Scott Spiezio later played for the St. Louis Cardinals world championship team. Eckstein and Spiezio played alongside Yadier Molina, younger brother of Bengie and José Molina, on the Cardinals. José later won a second World Series title with the Yankees, while John Lackey added two World Series rings with the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs.

===Giants===
Game 7 of the series was Dusty Baker&#x27;s final game as manager of the Giants, as he left in the offseason to take the same position with the Cubs due to disagreements with ownership. Game 7 was also Jeff Kent&#x27;s last game in San Francisco, as he signed a free-agent contract to play for the Houston Astros during the off-season. The departure of manager Baker, a season-long feud with Barry Bonds and a desire to be closer to his family&#x27;s Texas ranch factored into Kent&#x27;s eventual decision to leave the Giants. He retired as the all-time leader in home runs as a second baseman. Kent, the 2000 MVP would later be inducted into the San Francisco Giants Wall of Fame in 2009.

The Giants would return to the postseason the following season under new manager Felipe Alou with a 100 win season (the first time in ten years), but they would lose in the NLDS to the Florida Marlins, a Wild Card team that later won the World Series championship. After a second-place finish in 2004, the Giants had losing seasons for the next four years, and they replaced Alou with Bruce Bochy in 2007. After losing 90 games in 2008, the Giants won 88 games for a surprising third-place finish in 2009. Building on their 2009 season, the Giants returned to the postseason in 2010 as a Divisional Winner team, defeating the Braves in the NLDS, and the Phillies in the NLCS en route to the World Series, where they defeated the Rangers in five games, earning the long-awaited championship they could not reach in 2002. In 2012, after fighting back from down two games to none in the NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds (led by Baker) and down three games to one against the defending World Series Champions, the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, they swept the Detroit Tigers for their second World Series Championship in three years. In 2014, the Giants added their third title in five seasons by defeating the Kansas City Royals in seven games.

Of the players from the 2002 Giants (excluding previous World Series champions Liván Hernández, Robb Nen and Reggie Sanders), only Scott Eyre and Pedro Feliz went on to win a World Series ring with another team. Eyre and Feliz became teammates on the 2008 Philadelphia Phillies world championship team. By the time San Francisco won their first World Series in 2010, there were no members of the 2002 squad still on that team.

====Barry Bonds====
In terms of personal accolades, Barry Bonds would break Hank Aaron&#x27;s all-time homerun record in 2007. Bonds also won two more National League MVPs in 2003 and 2004, extending his record for most MVP Awards to seven. Bonds would enter free agency at the end of the 2007 season for the first time since coming over from Pittsburgh to San Francisco in 1993, but there were no teams interested in signing him. Bonds would not play another major league game after the 2007 season. He retired as one of the greatest players in MLB history to never to win a championship, along with Ted Williams and Ty Cobb, with the three straight NLCS trips in 1990, 1991, and 1992 with Pittsburgh and 2002 being his only real shot at a World Series in his 21-year career.

Bonds&#x27; last few seasons and his post-playing career would be mired due to performance enhancing drugs allegations. The only way Bonds could make the National Baseball Hall of Fame would be through the Veterans Committee, as he lost out to David Ortiz in the 2022 ballot, his 10th and final one. This was met with negative reaction from some fans, as fans complained that Ortiz had made the Hall of Fame, despite testing positive for PEDs in 2003, whilst Bonds never tested positive for any PEDs.

====Dusty Baker====
Dusty Baker received great fan ire for his decision to pull Russ Ortiz in Game 6 with a 5–0 lead and just a few more outs away from clinching San Francisco&#x27;s first World Series in the city.

Baker would serve as the manager for the Chicago Cubs in 2003 after mutually parting ways in San Francisco after the World Series. As with the Giants, he would help break a postseason drought, as he led them to a series victory in the 2003 National League Division Series over Atlanta, the first postseason series victory in 95 years for Chicago. However, they would lose in the 2003 National League Championship Series to the Florida Marlins when they were five outs from clinching a pennant in Game 6. This was the first of a long line of postseason futility for Baker, who went to the postseason five further times in his next eleven seasons as a manager but failed to win a single series. In 2020, he was hired to manage the Houston Astros. He broke his postseason drought with the team by winning in the Wild Card Series that year (2020) and then returned to the World Series the following year (where they ultimately lost to Atlanta in six games) after winning the 2021 American League Championship Series. In 2022, he finally won a World championship on his third try, defeating Philadelphia in six games to set a new mark of being the manager with the most regular season victories (2,093) before winning their first championship. Russ Ortiz, the pitcher who nearly won Baker a world championship 20 years prior, congratulated Baker on his first championship as a manager on Instagram. After he his retirement in 2023, Baker joined the Giants front office as a special advisor, his third stint with the club (player in 1984, manager from 1993-2002.

<doc id="1103753" wikidata="Q2254234" url="?curid=1103753" title="Havana 3am">
<text>Havana 3am was a British-American rock supergroup formed in 1986 by singer/guitarist Nigel Dixon (previously of the band Whirlwind), guitarist Gary Myrick, and bassist Paul Simonon (previously of the Clash). The band also included Travis Williams, a drummer whom they later found by a newspaper announcement. The band&#x27;s name was taken from the title of a 1956 album by Pérez Prado. Havana 3am&#x27;s music incorporated elements of rockabilly, Latin and reggae influences.

The band eventually signed a worldwide record deal with I.R.S. Records, then travelled to Japan to record with audio engineer Masahiko Yamazaki at a studio in Tokyo. Their self-titled album, released in 1991, received mixed reviews and contained the single &quot;Reach the Rock&quot;, which was a minor radio hit in certain markets.

Following Dixon&#x27;s death in April 1993, Simonon left the group and continued his career in visual art. Myrick, now both lead vocalist and sole guitarist, assembled a new line-up with Jamie Chez (formerly of Ta Mara and the Seen) and Tom Felicetta. The trio, calling themselves Gary Myrick &amp; Havana 3am, released one more album in 1996, but it was less successful and they broke up shortly thereafter.

<doc id="1103769" wikidata="Q6805564" url="?curid=1103769" title="Media Watch (TV program)">
<text>Media Watch (formerly Media Watch: The Last Word) is a television programme from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) dedicated to the analysis and critique of Australian media, including its corporate and political interconnections. The program&#x27;s host is Linton Besser.

The show has had a long-running role in exposing dubious, unethical, and corrupt behavior within the nation&#x27;s media and corporate controllers. In 1999, this included its key role in revealing corrupt conduct within the talk-back radio industry involving high-profile hosts Alan Jones and John Laws. The scandal, which became known as the &quot;cash for comment affair&quot;, was the subject of a prominent investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA), later forcing the resignation of its chairman David Flint after the show revealed his partisan behavior concerning the organisation&#x27;s inquiries.

==Format==

&quot;Media Watch&quot; is a 15-minute program which identifies, investigates and examines instances of what the program determines to be failings in news coverage by Australian media outlets. The series features a single host speaking directly to camera, detailing a mix of amusing or embarrassing editing gaffes (such as miscaptioned photographs or spelling errors) as well as more serious criticism including media bias and breaches of journalistic ethics and standards. Over the years, the program&#x27;s emphasis has shifted towards the latter.

Although most episodes of &quot;Media Watch&quot; focus on any recent incidents of media misconduct, episodes sometimes focus on a single issue of particular importance (for instance, news coverage of a recent election).

==Presenters==
Stuart Littlemore was the inaugural host of &quot;Media Watch&quot;. Since his nine-year tenure, various other journalists have hosted the program. Paul Barry, who previously hosted the program in 2000 and for a brief period in 2010, resumed hosting duties in 2013, and is the show&#x27;s longest-running host. He left the show on 2 December 2024. Linton Besser currently hosts the program.

==Notable pieces==

===&quot;Cash for comment&quot;===

In 1999, &quot;Media Watch&quot; revealed a regime of corrupt secret payments within the talkback radio industry which included influential hosts Alan Jones and John Laws. They had been paid to provide favourable on-air comment about companies such as Qantas, Optus, Foxtel and Mirvac without disclosing these arrangements to listeners. Media Watch also persistently criticised the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) as impotent or unwilling to regulate broadcast media, and to properly scrutinise figures such as Jones and Laws. The revelations won &quot;Media Watch&quot; staffers Richard Ackland, Deborah Richards and Anne Connolly two Walkley Awards: the Gold Walkley, and the Walkley for TV Current Affairs Reporting (Less Than 10 Minutes). 

In 2004, &quot;Media Watch&quot; played a major part in forcing the resignation of ABA head David Flint after it was discovered that Flint had sent Jones admiring and effusive letters at a time when the ABA was investigating Jones concerning further cash for comment allegations. The reports won &quot;Media Watch&quot; another Walkley, TV Current Affairs Reporting (Less Than 20 Minutes) to staffers David Marr, Peter McEvoy and Sally Virgoe.

===&quot;60 Minutes&quot; 1995 massacre at Srebrenica story===
In 2002, Channel Nine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reporter Richard Carleton sued &quot;Media Watch&quot; over allegations of plagiarism. The judge found that the allegations were untrue and declined to award any damages.

===&quot;ACON &amp; The ABC&quot;===

In 2022, &quot;Media Watch&quot; ran a piece about &quot;a difficult conversation we all need to have&quot;, accusing the ABC of bias against &quot;anti-trans voices&quot; by examining its collaboration with LGBT health organization ACON, and its participation in ACON&#x27;s &quot;Workplace Equality Index&quot;, in which it has at least twice received the title of &quot;Gold Employer&quot;. The piece drew significant scorn from ABC news staff, with Patricia Karvelas responding with &quot;The ABC also participates in other benchmarking indexes to monitor its progress and improve workplace practices, such as those run by the Diversity Council of Australia, Reconciliation Australia and the Australian Network on Disability. But only scrutiny of one group.&quot; Luke Siddham Dundon tweeted &quot;The ABC also has relationships with other diversity organisations, so why are you picking on our partnerships with LGBTQI+ communities and organisations?&quot; ABC tech reporter Ariel Bogle responded by stating that anti-trans talking points are &quot;often intertwined with far-right entities and narratives&quot;.

The ABC itself issued a statement on the matter, saying &quot;participation in benchmarking indexes has no bearing on content commissioning processes and no influence on editorial content&quot; and &quot;transgender and gender identity issues are complex and require careful editorial judgement to ensure informed reporting without causing offence or undue distress and harm to vulnerable individuals and communities.&quot;

==Cancellation and return==
&quot;Media Watch&quot;″s ability to generate controversy led to the temporary cancellation of the show. In 2000, Barry was controversially sacked and, in 2001, the program itself was axed by Jonathan Shier, the head of the ABC. However, in early 2002, after Shier was himself sacked in similarly controversial circumstances, the show returned with David Marr as the new host. While &quot;Media Watch&quot; was off air, former host Stuart Littlemore presented a replacement program, &quot;Littlemore&quot;, that also examined issues about the media, running for 13 episodes between March and May 2001.

==&quot;Media Bites&quot;==
Starting in 2017 in conjunction with &quot;Media Watch&quot;″s return and running until Paul Barry&#x27;s departure in 2024, an online spin-off series, &quot;Media Bites&quot;, ran weekly. A new episode was uploaded every Thursday to the program&#x27;s website, social media outlets, iView and ABC&#x27;s official YouTube channel, each episode running for about two minutes. Unlike the main show, &quot;Media Bites&quot; is more casual in presentation, and Barry sat in the production office (not a studio) talking to the camera in a position similar to many online vloggers. Barry was often in more casual clothing using the light source of the office instead of professional lighting.

Each episode has the same format, two mini-stories and the week&#x27;s alternative fact. The mini-stories are in essence a shorter version of the main series in-depth format, introducing the story and explaining the problem. The Alternative Fact of the Week points out an incorrect or baffling titbit, often involving US President Donald Trump. Episodes conclude with a &quot;teaser&quot; for the following episode of the main show. The episodes contained the same sarcasm and quips from Barry as does the main show.

Episodes were edited in a similar fashion to the main show, with relevant corresponding images, text and effects relating to his narration. One difference in editing is that subtitles are permanently part of the video along the bottom of the screen, instead of being an optional closed caption.

==Reception==
The show&#x27;s presenters have taken some pride in the vehemence of the criticism it attracts; at one point, the opening credits were made up of a montage of such criticisms, prominently featuring a description of original presenter Stuart Littlemore as a &#x27;pompous git&#x27;. In 2002, the then-editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Campbell Reid, sent host David Marr a dead fish; a replica of it is now awarded as the Campbell Reid Perpetual Trophy for the Brazen Recycling of Other People&#x27;s Work. Known as &quot;The Barra&quot; and bearing the motto &quot;Carpe Verbatim&quot;, it is awarded annually for bad journalism and particularly plagiarism (a practice for which Reid was frequently criticised).

&quot;Media Watch&quot; scrutinises all media outlets, and has criticised its own network, the ABC. When Marr was host from 2002 to 2004, the show often criticised Marr&#x27;s employer John Fairfax Holdings.

Robert Manne, writing in &quot;The Age&quot; in 2007, commented that:
Media Watch was once, unashamedly, a program of the left... was sometimes unbalanced and unfair, usually intelligent and witty, always fearless and tough. No program more effectively tracked the steady drift of the political culture to the right. No program more effectively scrutinised the politics and practices of the contemporary commercial mainstream media—the rise of commentariat Islamophobia, the scandal of &quot;cash for comment&quot;. The fact that it was not &quot;impartial&quot; was the key to its unpopularity in certain quarters, but also to its importance and success.

===Criticisms from News Corp outlets===
Commentary programs and segments on Sky News Australia also allege the program has a consistent left wing bias. Following the 2019 federal election, Sky News Australia commentator Chris Kenny (writing for &quot;The Australian&quot;) claimed that the program had a reliance on Labor Party or trade union-aligned journalists for its criticisms of News Corp. Kenny further claimed a failure to disclose these alleged associations, and opined that this undermined the credibility of host Barry&#x27;s analyses of News Corp&#x27;s output &amp; business methods.

&quot;The Australian&quot;, which is regularly criticised by &quot;Media Watch&quot;, has been a long-term critic of the show. In August 2007 it editorialised that &quot;Media Watch&quot; &quot;lacks journalistic integrity and conducts its affairs along the lines of an insiders&#x27; club that pushes its ideological prejudice at taxpayers&#x27; expense&quot;.

In June 2007, an episode of &quot;Media Watch&quot; entitled &quot;Have Your Spray&quot; strongly criticised &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, among others, for failing to censor racist comments on their website forums posted over an extended period, but then allowed strongly anti-Semitic comments to remain on its own web forum for a &quot;few minutes&quot; until removed. The ABC later launched an internal inquiry into claims and criticisms published by &quot;News Corp&quot; mastheads that &quot;Media Watch&quot; allegedly relied on &quot;IslamicSydney&quot;, supposedly &quot;an Islamic website that peddle[s] anti-Semitic and jihadi messages&quot;, for this story.

<text>In mathematics, in the area of harmonic analysis, the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is a family of linear transformations generalizing the Fourier transform. It can be thought of as the Fourier transform to the &quot;n&quot;-th power, where &quot;n&quot; need not be an integer — thus, it can transform a function to any &quot;intermediate&quot; domain between time and frequency. Its applications range from filter design and signal analysis to phase retrieval and pattern recognition.

The FRFT can be used to define fractional convolution, correlation, and other operations, and can also be further generalized into the linear canonical transformation (LCT). An early definition of the FRFT was introduced by Condon, by solving for the Green&#x27;s function for phase-space rotations, and also by Namias, generalizing work of Wiener on Hermite polynomials.

However, it was not widely recognized in signal processing until it was independently reintroduced around 1993 by several groups. Since then, there has been a surge of interest in extending Shannon&#x27;s sampling theorem for signals which are band-limited in the Fractional Fourier domain.

A completely different meaning for &quot;fractional Fourier transform&quot; was introduced by Bailey and Swartztrauber as essentially another name for a z-transform, and in particular for the case that corresponds to a discrete Fourier transform shifted by a fractional amount in frequency space (multiplying the input by a linear chirp) and evaluating at a fractional set of frequency points (e.g. considering only a small portion of the spectrum). (Such transforms can be evaluated efficiently by Bluestein&#x27;s FFT algorithm.) This terminology has fallen out of use in most of the technical literature, however, in preference to the FRFT. The remainder of this article describes the FRFT.

==Introduction==
The continuous Fourier transform formula_1 of a function formula_2 is a unitary operator of formula_3 space that maps the function formula_4 to its frequential version formula_5 (all expressions are taken in the formula_3 sense, rather than pointwise):

formula_7

and formula_4 is determined by formula_5 via the inverse transform formula_10

formula_11

Let us study its &quot;n&quot;-th iterated formula_12 defined by 
formula_13 and formula_14 when &quot;n&quot; is a non-negative integer, and formula_15. Their sequence is finite since formula_1 is a 4-periodic automorphism: for every function formula_4, formula_18.

More precisely, let us introduce the parity operator formula_19 that inverts formula_20, formula_21. Then the following properties hold:
formula_22
formula_23

The FRFT provides a family of linear transforms that further extends this definition to handle non-integer powers formula_24 of the FT.

==Definition==
Note: some authors write the transform in terms of the &quot;order &quot; instead of the &quot;angle &quot;, in which case the is usually times . Although these two forms are equivalent, one must be careful about which definition the author uses.

For any real , the -angle fractional Fourier transform of a function ƒ is denoted by formula_25 and defined by:
For , this becomes precisely the definition of the continuous Fourier transform, and for it is the definition of the inverse continuous Fourier transform.

The FRFT argument is neither a spatial one nor a frequency . We will see why it can be interpreted as linear combination of both coordinates . When we want to distinguish the -angular fractional domain, we will let formula_26 denote the argument of formula_27.

Remark: with the angular frequency ω convention instead of the frequency one, the FRFT formula is the Mehler kernel,
formula_28

===Properties===
The -th order fractional Fourier transform operator, formula_27, has the properties:

====Additivity====
For any real angles ,
formula_30

====Linearity====
formula_31

====Integer Orders====
If is an integer multiple of formula_32, then:
formula_33

Moreover, it has following relation

formula_34

====Inverse====
formula_35

====Commutativity====
formula_36

====Associativity====
formula_37

====Unitarity====
formula_38

====Time Reversal====
formula_39
formula_40

====Transform of a shifted function====
Define the shift and the phase shift operators as follows:

formula_41

Then
formula_42

that is,

formula_43

====Transform of a scaled function====
Define the scaling and chirp multiplication operators as follows:
formula_44

Then, 
formula_45

Notice that the fractional Fourier transform of formula_46 cannot be expressed as a scaled version of formula_47. Rather, the fractional Fourier transform of formula_46 turns out to be a scaled and chirp modulated version of formula_49 where formula_50 is a different order.

===Fractional kernel===
The FRFT is an integral transform
formula_51
where the α-angle kernel is
formula_52

Here again the special cases are consistent with the limit behavior when approaches a multiple of .

The FRFT has the same properties as its kernels :
* symmetry: formula_53
* inverse: formula_54
* additivity: formula_55

===Related transforms===
There also exist related fractional generalizations of similar transforms such as the discrete Fourier transform.

* The discrete fractional Fourier transform is defined by Zeev Zalevsky. A quantum algorithm to implement a version of the discrete fractional Fourier transform in sub-polynomial time is described by Somma.
* The Fractional wavelet transform (FRWT) is a generalization of the classical wavelet transform in the fractional Fourier transform domains.
* The chirplet transform for a related generalization of the wavelet transform.

===Generalizations===
The Fourier transform is essentially bosonic; it works because it is consistent with the superposition principle and related interference patterns. There is also a fermionic Fourier transform. These have been generalized into a supersymmetric FRFT, and a supersymmetric Radon transform. There is also a fractional Radon transform, a symplectic FRFT, and a symplectic wavelet transform. Because quantum circuits are based on unitary operations, they are useful for computing integral transforms as the latter are unitary operators on a function space. A quantum circuit has been designed which implements the FRFT.

==Interpretation==
===Time-frequency analysis===
The usual interpretation of the Fourier transform is as a transformation of a time domain signal into a frequency domain signal. On the other hand, the interpretation of the inverse Fourier transform is as a transformation of a frequency domain signal into a time domain signal. Fractional Fourier transforms transform a signal (either in the time domain or frequency domain) into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the time–frequency domain. This perspective is generalized by the linear canonical transformation, which generalizes the fractional Fourier transform and allows linear transforms of the time–frequency domain other than rotation.

Take the figure below as an example. If the signal in the time domain is rectangular (as below), it becomes a sinc function in the frequency domain. But if one applies the fractional Fourier transform to the rectangular signal, the transformation output will be in the domain between time and frequency.
The fractional Fourier transform is a rotation operation on a time–frequency distribution. From the definition above, for &quot;α&quot; = 0, there will be no change after applying the fractional Fourier transform, while for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;π&quot;/2, the fractional Fourier transform becomes a plain Fourier transform, which rotates the time–frequency distribution with &quot;π&quot;/2. For other value of &quot;α&quot;, the fractional Fourier transform rotates the time–frequency distribution according to α. The following figure shows the results of the fractional Fourier transform with different values of &quot;α&quot;.


===Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction===
The diffraction of light can be calculated using integral transforms. The Fresnel diffraction integral is used to find the near field diffraction pattern. In the far-field limit this equation becomes a Fourier transform to give the equation for Fraunhofer diffraction. The fractional Fourier transform is equivalent to the Fresnel diffraction equation. When the angle formula_56 becomes formula_57, the fractional Fourier transform is the standard Fourier transform and gives the far-field diffraction pattern. The near-field diffraction maps to values of formula_56 between 0 and formula_57.

==Application==
Fractional Fourier transform can be used in time frequency analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but with the help of the fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and we can get the desired signal.
Thus, using just truncation in the time domain, or equivalently low-pass filters in the frequency domain, one can cut out any convex set in time–frequency space. In contrast, using time domain or frequency domain tools without a fractional Fourier transform would only allow cutting out rectangles parallel to the axes.

Fractional Fourier transforms also have applications in quantum physics. For example, they are used to formulate entropic uncertainty relations, in high-dimensional quantum key distribution schemes with single photons, and in observing spatial entanglement of photon pairs.

They are also useful in the design of optical systems and for optimizing holographic storage efficiency.

<doc id="1103779" wikidata="Q550458" url="?curid=1103779" title="Endpin">
<text>The endpin is the component of a cello or double bass that makes contact with the floor to support the instrument&#x27;s weight. It is made of metal, carbon fiber, or, occasionally, wood, and is typically extensible from the bottom of the instrument, secured there with a thumbscrew or other tightening mechanism. Most bass clarinets and contrabassoons also have a similar fixture. Endpins became a standard part of the cello in the mid-19th century. Before then, celli were held tightly with the legs. Some performers of pieces of baroque music continue to not use an endpin during period performances. The endpin is widely credited to making the cello more appealing to play for women, who were before compelled to hold the instrument on the floor due to the complicated dress and fashion of the time.

==Types of endpins==
Endpins are usually tipped with a point to stick into the floor, which is sometimes capped with black rubber to preserve the floor&#x27;s surface and provide friction. Generally, endpins are parallel to the long axis of the instrument, but some cellists and bassists fit their instruments with a Tortelier-style endpin, which angles more towards the floor, improving mobility at the expense of stability. Also, some endpins have a secondary extension for tall musicians. The endpin also may have notches cut in it, allowing it to have extra holding strength at these points. 

==Endpin anchors==
Left-hand pressure on a cello fingerboard, acting against the fulcrum of the player&#x27;s chest and/or knees, may cause the endpin to slip forward on the floor. To prevent this slippage, objects known as &quot;endpin stoppers&quot;, &quot;pinstops&quot;, &quot;donuts&quot;, &quot;black holes&quot;, &quot;endpin anchors&quot;, &quot;endpin holders&quot;, &quot;spike holders&quot; or &quot;rock stops&quot; are sometimes used. 

One type of endpin stopper is placed between the endpin and the floor to add surface area and enhance friction, and stands alone. With this sort, the base must be made out of a non-slippery material like rubber. One very common type consists of a pliable disc surrounding a circular cup to hold the endpin&#x27;s tip, such as the &quot;Sure-Stop&quot;.

A different sort of endpin stopper uses the musician&#x27;s chair as an anchor. T-shaped wooden stoppers are anchored by placing the top of the T behind the chair legs. Straight plank stoppers use one or two straps with loops at the end which are anchored around the chair legs. Since in this case the distance from the stopper to the chair is usually fixed, such stoppers typically have a line of dents running down the plank, allowing the instrument&#x27;s angle to be adjusted by placing the endpin in a different dent.

Basses do not always require stoppers, being heavier and usually played in a more vertical orientation than a cello. However, bassists often use rockstops when sitting on a stool or when playing on high-glossed floors or uneven surfaces.

==Endpins and flooring==
Pointed endpins can cause extensive damage, especially to tile and wooden flooring. Many music rooms bear evidence of this in a myriad of small holes or chips. Here, rubber tips and/or stoppers are beneficial. On carpet, the damage is less extensive. The bare tip is thus most effective in outdoor conditions, carpeted areas, and old flooring where the damage will not be as serious. However, the sharper the endpin, the more likely it is to go through the standard rubber tip.

<text>The bogong moth (Agrotis infusa) is a temperate species of night-flying moth, notable for its biannual long-distance seasonal migrations towards and from the Australian Alps, similar to the diurnal monarch butterfly. During the autumn and winter it is found in southern Queensland, western New South Wales, western Victoria, and also in South and Western Australia. Adult bogong moths breed and larvae hatch during this period, consuming winter pasture plants during their growth. During the spring, the moths migrate south or east and reside in mountains such as Mount Bogong, where they gregariously aestivate over the summer until their return towards breeding grounds again in the autumn.

The moth&#x27;s name, &quot;bogong&quot;, is derived from an Australian Aboriginal language; the Dhudhuroa word &quot;bugung&quot; describes the brown colouration of the moth. It is an icon of Australian wildlife due to its historical role as an important food source and because Aboriginal peoples would come to where the moths spend the summer to feast on them and hold intertribal gatherings. In recent years, it has invaded major cities like Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney due to strong winds during its spring migration.

Starting around 1980 and accelerating rapidly after 2016, the Bogong Moth population has sharply declined as a result of increasingly severe droughts, along with increased temperatures in caves used by the moths for aestivation, both primarily resulting from anthropogenic climate change. In December 2021 the bogong moth was added to the IUCN Red List as an Endangered Species.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
Bogong moths was first described by French lepidopterist Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1832, who described the moth as &quot;Noctua infusa&quot; from a type specimen from Australia. He described the moth as having blackish-brown hind wings. However, in 1903 British entomologist George Hampson classified a specimen with white hind wings under this name, alongside another specimen of &quot;Agrotis spina&quot; with blackish-brown hind wings. Australian amateur entomologist Alfred Jefferis Turner identified &quot;A. spina&quot; as a synonym of &quot;A. infusa&quot; in 1920. I. F. B. Common, an Australian entomologist, found specimens with both hind wing colours in 1954. Specimens with the white hind wings were only found during specific months in mercury vapour light traps near Canberra, and he attributed the white hind wing specimens to a seasonal form.

The moth&#x27;s name, &quot;bogong&quot;, is derived from the Dhudhuroa word &quot;bugung&quot;, meaning brown moth. Its presence has contributed to the naming of numerous locations and landmarks. For example, a town, Bogong, in the Australian state of Victoria has been named after the moth. Mount Bogong, located south of the Bogong High Plains, is also named after the moth, with its traditional name, &quot;Warkwoolowler&quot;, meaning the mountain where Aboriginal people collected the &quot;boo.gong fly&quot;. The Taungurung name for the bogong moth is &quot;debera&quot;.

In the Australian state of New South Wales, a series of mountains in the Kosciuszko National Park are named the Bogong Peaks.

== Description ==

Adult bogong moths have an overall dark brown colouration, with a dark stripe interrupted by two light-coloured spots on the wings, distinguishing it from other moths. There are visual differences between the migratory and nonmigratory forms of the moth; migratory moths have brown hind wings while nonmigratory moths have paler hind wings. Bogong moths have a wingspan ranging between 40–50 mm (1.6-2.0 in), and a body length of around 25–35 mm (1-1.4 in). The average weight of an adult bogong moth is 0.326 grams.

Bogong moth eggs are dome–shaped in appearance and are vertically ridged. They are 0.7 mm (0.03 in) in diameter and 0.4 mm (0.02 in) in height.

Caterpillars initially start out with a pale colouration, but as they grow and consume food they become green with pale and dark stripes and spots. Larvae achieve a maximum length of 50 mm (2.0 in).

== Distribution and habitat ==
Bogong moth populations are primarily located across southern Australia, west of the Great Dividing Range. The regions contain populations of nonmigratory and migratory moths of this species, distinguished by their differing seasonal presences in each region. The adult bogong moth lays eggs across New South Wales, southern Queensland, and northern parts of Victoria, where larvae hatch and grow until adulthood. During the spring season and subsequent summer aestivation, bogong moths migrate south or east towards the Australian Alps, and can be found in the Australian Capital Territory and Bogong Mountains. However, bogong moths can also be found in locations as far as Tasmania and New Zealand due to strong winds that blow them off their path.

=== Breeding grounds ===
Bogong moth eggs and larvae are primarily found in self-mulching soils (soil that mixes itself) and crop pastures, where both wild and agricultural larval food sources are abundant during the autumn and winter seasons. The heavy presence of larvae in these pastures can lead to significant crop damage. During the spring and summer seasons, when grasses overtake these pastures, conditions are unfavourable for larval survival since larvae do not consume these plants. This leads to delayed breeding, as bogong moths are multivoltine and so can raise multiple generations. Instead, adult bogong moths migrate in a southerly direction during the summer and aestivate (remain dormant), until conditions are favourable again.

=== Aestivation sites ===
During the spring migration, adult bogong moths can be found in their ideal aestivation sites, which generally consist of cool, dark caves and crevices but can include spaces underneath tors and even fallen tree trunks. Stable temperatures and humidity make these locations ideal for bogong moth aestivation. Crevices regulate their environment through wind flow, and caves generally have more regular temperatures and greater humidity. This reduces water loss in bogong moths during their inactivity. While temporary sites can be used in lower elevations, these sites undergo massive population fluctuations and movements throughout their use. Permanent aestivation sites are generally found in higher altitudes of 1500 metres (4920 ft) or above, with the largest, most stable aggregations found on the summits of mountains such as Mt. Gingera.

== Life cycle ==
Adult bogong moths lay up to 2000 eggs in the soil or on plants near the soil after returning from aestivation sites in the autumn migration. Incubation times vary depending on temperature, with eggs hatching after a period of 4–7 days in laboratory conditions. The larvae of bogong moths undergo six instars. Caterpillars grow slowly throughout the first three instars, taking until June to develop over the winter. However, the larvae go through fast growth during the spring, reaching the final instar in late August to September, soon before migration. They are active at night, when they feed on plants within breeding grounds. Larvae undergo pupation in soil chambers at a depth of 20–150 mm (0.8-7.9 in). Pupation can last between 3–11 weeks depending on the temperature and environment. Pupae are 20 mm (0.8 in) in length and have a shiny, brown appearance. Adults emerge from the soil chambers and shortly after begin migration. Adult bogong moths are active at night, and have different seasonal behaviors. During the spring, bogong moths feed and migrate south, where they aestivate during the summer. Adult bogong moths are not sexually mature yet, and do not actively seek food during this period of dormancy. In autumn, the moths migrate again and return to their breeding grounds, laying eggs and dying.

== Behaviour ==
=== Food resources ===
Bogong moth larvae subsist on winter pasture crops and wild crop weeds such as cape weeds within bogong moth breeding grounds, primarily depending on annual dicotyledons that grow during the winter. Attacks on a wide variety of cultivated crops have been seen, with plants such as &quot;Medicago&quot; species, wheat, cabbages, cauliflowers, silver beet, peas, and potatoes all recorded being consumed by bogong moth caterpillars. However, the larvae avoid grasses, which overtake pastures during the summer, making summer unfavourable due to lack of larval food sources. Adult bogong moths feed on the nectar of flowers such as &quot;Epacris&quot;, &quot;Grevillea&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; while breeding or migrating, but will not actively feed during aestivation.

=== Migration ===
Bogong moths undergo whole scale long-distance migration biannually, in which they can travel up to 965 km (600 miles). The spring migration begins in early September and occurs from the lowlands of Southern Australia south towards the Australian Alps for purposes of reaching aestivation sites. During the summer, the moths remain in their aestivation sites until autumn, when they migrate back towards the breeding grounds of the lowlands as early as February, but primarily in April. The bogong moth utilises particular aestivation sites repeatedly throughout migrations, as seen with the development of parasites that depend on the regular arrival and departure of the moths from caves. The population within each aestivation site fluctuates throughout the summer due to moth mortality and the departure and arrival of moths either migrating further south for aestivation or north to return to breeding grounds. However, this differs from changes during migration periods, when the populations rapidly increase with arrival or decrease with departure.

Bogong moths are nocturnal migrants, but the exact mechanism for long-distance navigation is not clear. It is possible that they are oriented by light, as seen in the influence of light intensity on activity during aestivation. Additionally, bogong moths may use an internal magnetic compass to aid in navigation, as seen in the similar monarch butterfly. A study published in 2018 concluded that the Bogong moth uses a combination of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and recognisable landmarks to calibrate their route.

However, there are also nonmigratory populations; this generally occurs in areas with favourable conditions, where migration to avoid harsh conditions such as seasonal changes in larval food crop abundance is not necessary. Some populations of bogong moths in areas such as Tasmania and in coastal populations of New South Wales do not migrate, and reach sexual maturity at a faster rate than migratory populations.

=== Social aggregation ===

During the spring migration, bogong moths gregariously aggregate with densities reaching 17,000 moths per square metre (10.8 square feet) within caves, crevices, and other areas hidden from the sunlight. The lack of light and relatively constant temperature and humidity makes these spots favourable during aestivation. The first moths that arrive occupy the deepest and darkest locations, using their fore tarsi to grip onto the rock faces, and aggregations form around these initial areas, with moths arriving later settling for less ideal areas with more sunlight, higher temperatures, and decreased humidity. To diminish the amount of light that reaches their light-sensitive eyes, later moths push themselves underneath the wings and abdomens of moths that arrived earlier and place their hind legs on top of the moths beneath them. This physical contact and aggregation allow the moths to retain body moisture. When the aestivating moths are disturbed, the moths within the area of disturbance briefly spread out and leave the aggregation, dropping excrement when unsettled before quickly returning to the aggregation and re-positioning themselves.

While the moths mostly remain dormant during aestivation, there are some periods of activity within the aggregation which are correlated to changes in light intensity. During dawn and dusk, portions of the population become active, first crawling around and spreading out, and then flying out of their shelter into the open. While some water drinking has been observed, no evidence of copulation or active foraging has been found during these periods of activity.

=== Diapause ===
Facultative diapause, an optional period of delayed development in response to environmental conditions, accompanies the biannual migration of the bogong moths. While one generation of moths goes through the two migrations each year, multiple generations are possible in favourable conditions and higher temperatures, as growth across all life stages can occur faster. For example, without the diapause, the bogong moth would normally complete sexual maturation within 50 days. However, this maturation is delayed due to the lack of larval food sources during the summer season. During the summer, hot temperatures occur and grasses, which are an unfavourable diet for bogong moth larvae, overtake pastures and make up the majority of the plants occupying the pastures. Bogong moths avoid this harsh environment by delaying development during the summer so that their eggs do not hatch in a poorly-suited environment; instead, they migrate to cooler, more suitable areas and delay their development during aestivation until the winter season, when they return to the breeding grounds and winter pasture crops begin to grow again. During aestivation, the bogong moths remain dormant for several months, possibly delaying development due to the lower temperatures. The food they consume during the migration is also dedicated to building fat reserves for aestivation rather than development, as bogong moths must consume more food during the autumn migration before maturation and mating. However, in areas with favourable conditions, bogong moths do not have to migrate during the summer.

== Ecology ==

=== Enemies ===

==== Predators ====
The bogong moth suffers from predation during both its migration and aestivation. During the spring and autumn migrations, several species of birds, mammals, and even fish have been recorded preying on the moth. Little raven, currawong and Australian pipit congregations form to feast on bogong moths as they travel from aestivation sites during migration. Aboriginal people also travelled to aestivation sites to feast on the dormant moths, and may have searched for these bird congregations to locate these sites. Bats also attack the moths during active flight periods during the dusk, and foxes, bush rats, and dusky antechinus have been recorded eating moths. Of the mammals that prey on the bogong moth, the endangered mountain pygmy-possum is the most reliant on bogong moths as a source of food.
==== Parasites ====
Two species of mermithid nematodes parasitise the bogong moth during its aestivation: &quot;Amphimermis bogongae&quot; and &quot;Hexamermis cavicola.&quot; The parasites are transmitted to bogong moths through water; the early instar larval nematodes reside in the debris of the cave floors of common aestivation sites, and crawl up to reach the moths through trickles of water coming down the walls. Bogong moths are infected upon their arrival within the caves once they drink the water. After a few months, the larval nematodes emerge from the moths, which causes the moth to die, and burrow into the cave floor, where they mature and lay eggs over the winter and wait for the next spring migration of the moths. The nematodes are unusual in that they parasitise adult bogong moths instead of the more commonly utilised larval host stage. The nematodes&#x27; life cycles demonstrate an adaptation to the migration of the bogong moths, as they are dependent on bogong moths returning to the same aestivation sites.

=== Biovector of arsenic ===

Concerns have been raised over the potential role of agriculture in turning the bogong moth into a biovector of arsenic in the Australian Alps. Aggregations of bogong moths in aestivation sites has led to the bioaccumulation of the pollutant in both the surrounding local environment and within predators, particularly in the endangered mountain pygmy possum. However, no conclusive evidence has directly linked agriculture as the source of arsenic in bogong moths.

In 2001, a few months after rainfall had washed out debris consisting of dead moths from within the cave, the complete death of local grasses was seen outside of an aestivation site of the bogong moth. Investigation into the causes of the grass mortality showed that the concentration of arsenic in the surrounding areas was much higher than normal, and the source was determined to be the bogong moths. Since the bogong moths do not feed at their aestivation sites, they had absorbed arsenic from lowland feeding sites as larvae and subsequently transported it over long distances into the mountains. Bioaccumulation, the absorption and accumulation of substances by organisms, occurs with arsenic in bogong moths. While levels within each individual moth are small, the sheer quantity of moths in the area led to a concentration of the pollutant to damaging levels in the environment. The presence of arsenic has also been shown in the feces of mammals such as the mountain pygmy-possum, demonstrating the bioaccumulation of this pollutant in animals. While no source has been determined, concerns have been raised over the possible role of agriculture in the bioaccumulation of arsenic due to its presence in historically and presently-used insecticides. This has led to the discontinued use of insecticides in controlling the bogong moth in urban areas, in favour of less intrusive methods.

===Decline in numbers===

In the spring/summer aestivation seasons of 2017-8 and 2018-9, dramatic drops in numbers of the moths in the Alpine caves have been observed. Millions of the moths have usually lined the walls of these caves over summer, but for the 2017-8 and 2018-9 aestivation seasons there were none in some caves, according to Professor Eric Warrant of Lund University in Sweden. He says that the drop in numbers was probably caused by a lack of rainfall due to winter drought in their breeding areas and climate change, the lack of rain producing insufficient vegetation to feed the caterpillars. Some caves still harboured thousands of moths, which suggested that the moths &quot;came from different breeding grounds, where one location wasn&#x27;t as badly affected by the drought as the other. I don&#x27;t think they will disappear completely, but there&#x27;s certainly a possibility that they could become locally extinct at their breeding grounds.&quot;, Warrant said.

Other biologists and ecologists have pointed to the dramatic effect on animals which feed on the moths, which are an important source of protein for wildlife, including the threatened mountain pygmy possum as well as other insectivorous mammals and birds. &quot;The vulnerability of the Australian Alps to climate change is the worst in the world because we&#x27;ve got these short little mountains so when it gets warmer, there is nowhere for these cold-adapted species to go&quot;, according to Euan Ritchie, a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University.

== Interactions with humans ==

=== Food source ===
Bogong moths were historically used as a food source by Aboriginal peoples located in South-eastern Australia. Groups would travel to the area towards the summits of mountains to harvest moths, where they also met with other Aboriginal peoples, fostering inter-tribal relations as people gathered and feasted during these harvests. They would go into the caves and scrape aestivating moths off the walls into nets and dishes using sticks. Once gathered, the moths would be roasted to remove the scales and wings and then either eaten immediately or ground into a paste and made into &quot;moth meat&quot; cakes that would last and could be taken home. The moth was said to have a nice nutty flavour that was most similar to walnuts or almonds. The bogong moth is an icon of Australian wildlife due to this historical role as an important food source and as an inter-tribal gathering point in Southeastern Australia.

An excavation of Cloggs Cave, near Buchan in Victoria, revealed microscopic remains of moth on a small grinding stone, estimated to be about 2,000 years old. This is the first confirmed evidence of insect food remains discovered on a stone artefact in the whole world. The Gunaikurnai people were one of the peoples who used to travel to the mountains to obtain the high-fat, energy-rich food, and stories of these travels had been passed down in their oral history. The excavation was done by researchers from Monash University in collaboration with the traditional owners, represented by the Gunaikurnai Land and Waters Corporation (GLaWAC).

=== Pest of crop plants ===
Bogong moths have had a role in damaging crop plants since winter pastures serve as breeding grounds and larval food sources. Outbreaks of caterpillars have been recorded across New South Wales, with damage primarily done to heavy black soil flats. &quot;Medicago&quot; species, wheat, cabbages, cauliflowers, silver beet, peas, and potatoes have been recorded as being attacked by bogong moth larvae.

====Control====
The bogong moth is a minor and irregular pest of crop plants in Australia. This makes it difficult to predict their pattern and control. Typically, control of this species is not cost-effective. However, if there are heavy damaging outbreaks of the bogong moth, insecticide is applied to the crops that are affected by it.

=== Migration issues ===
Millions of bogong moths have been blown off course from their spring migration into major cities like Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney due to strong winds, with notable instances of Bogong Moth invasions including the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. The large amount of light and noise present can also attract moths towards cities. Parliament House in Canberra, present in the middle of the Bogong Moth flight path during migrations, was notably susceptible to moths. Light pollution from the building traps them during their flight and encourages the moth to find shelter within crevices, shadows, and sometimes even the insides of the buildings during the light and heat of the day. Efforts have been made to try and drive the moths out by turning off lights, covering attractive corners and pathways indoors, and using insecticides. However, insecticide use has ceased in urban areas due to concerns over environmental consequences.

==Conservation status==
In December 2021 the bogong moth was added to the IUCN Red List as an Endangered Species, based on a February 2021 assessment.

<doc id="1103787" wikidata="Q239840" url="?curid=1103787" title="Filippo Simeoni">
<text>Filippo Simeoni (born 17 August 1971) is an Italian former racing cyclist and the 2008 Italian road race champion. Simeoni won two stages in the Vuelta a España in 2001 and 2003, and the 2008 Italian National Road Race Championship.

==Biography==
He was born in Desio in the province of Milan.

Simeoni is known for his maverick actions. During the stage win in the Vuelta he stopped just before the finish line and walked across the finish line with his bike in his hands. He did so as a tribute to the victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks. Later the Union Cycliste Internationale fined him for this.

In May 2009 he returned his Italian Championship jersey as a protest after his team was not invited to the 2009 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

Following his retirement, Simeoni started organizing local races and set up a youth team. In early 2017, he was set to take up a position within the Italian Cycling Federation but was forced to withdraw due to a rule preventing anyone with a doping offense from taking office. The federation was unable to take into account that Simeoni&#x27;s sentence came in the light of a confession during the court cases against Michele Ferrari.

==Feud with Lance Armstrong==
Simeoni is better known for his years-long clash with Lance Armstrong. Simeoni was treated by doctor Michele Ferrari, who was also Armstrong&#x27;s doctor. Simeoni testified in court that he began doping in 1993, that Dr. Ferrari had prescribed him doping products such as EPO and Human Growth Hormone in 1996 and 1997, and that Ferrari also gave him instructions on how to use these products and that he used them. In 2001 and 2002 Simeoni was suspended for several months for doping use. Armstrong reportedly called Simeoni a &quot;liar&quot; in an interview with the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; in July 2003. Simeoni lodged a charge of defamation against Armstrong and demanded €100,000. Simeoni announced that he would give any money awarded to him to charity. In 2006 Simeoni dropped the lawsuit.

On the 18th stage of the 2004 edition of the Tour de France, Simeoni gapped up to a breakaway of six riders that posed no threat to Armstrong&#x27;s leading position. By then, Armstrong was leading the race by seven minutes, and was well on his way to his sixth consecutive Tour victory. Nevertheless, Armstrong broke from the peloton and chased Simeoni down, prompting Armstrong&#x27;s rival T-Mobile Team to try to catch the breakaway. This would not only catch Simeoni, but end any realistic chance of the six riders in the original breakaway had of winning the stage. The six riders implored Armstrong to drop back to the peloton, but Armstrong would not drop back unless Simeoni went with him. Armstrong&#x27;s longtime top domestique, George Hincapie, later recalled being surprised at Armstrong&#x27;s move, given his all-but-insurmountable lead.

In full view of the television cameras, Armstrong put his hand on Simeoni&#x27;s back and spoke to him. Simeoni subsequently told the United States Anti-Doping Agency that Armstrong told him in Italian:

Armstrong then spoke to some of the other riders in the breakaway. It later emerged that Armstrong told them that he would not allow the breakaway to survive as long as Simeoni was part of it. At that point, the other riders badgered Simeoni until he dropped back to the peloton with Armstrong. When Simeoni dropped back, he was abused by many other riders, including Andrea Peron, Filippo Pozzato and Giuseppe Guerini. In a later interview, he told of how Daniele Nardello also abused him, calling him &quot;a disgrace&quot;. Afterwards, Armstrong made a &quot;zip-the-lips&quot; gesture but later said that Simeoni &quot;did not deserve&quot; to win a stage. Armstrong said he was acting under the traditional authority granted to the &quot;Patron&quot; of the peloton by the unwritten rules of cycling. He claimed that he was &quot;protecting the interests of the peloton,&quot; and that Simeoni was out to &quot;destroy the sport that pays him.&quot;

The race ended two days later. By this time, Armstrong had long since secured his victory, and as such, the final stage is a slow stage in which the celebration starts early. However, Simeoni was still smarting from Armstrong’s intimidation three days before, and attacked several times. Each time, Armstrong&#x27;s team chased him down. Simeoni was again insulted and spat at by other riders after the race.

Since Simeoni was a prosecution witness in legal proceedings against Ferrari at the time of Armstrong&#x27;s move against him in the 2004 Tour, Italian authorities threatened to bring charges of witness intimidation against Armstrong. In March 2005 Armstrong was interviewed by the authorities, apparently without resolution. Armstrong had been indicted by Italian authorities in December 2005. A criminal court refused to hear the case in January 2006. On 6 March 2006 Armstong&#x27;s attorney asked a court to drop charges in Simeoni&#x27;s defamation lawsuit. On 13 April 2006 Simeoni dropped the defamation suit and Armstrong dismissed his countersuit.

Like Christophe Bassons six years earlier, Simeoni&#x27;s career suffered after his confrontation with Armstrong. He found it hard to catch on with a team. The final straw came in 2009, when his team was left out of the 2009 Giro d&#x27;Italia even though he won the 2008 Italian National champion Road race. In protest, Simeoni returned his 2008 Italian Championship jersey in May 2009. He was suspended for four months by the Italian Cycling Federation for doing so. He retired at the end of the 2009 season.

In October 2012, USADA stripped Armstrong of all seven of his Tour titles and banned from all sports that follow the World Anti-Doping Code for life, effectively ending his competitive career. Simeoni was one of the key witnesses in USADA&#x27;s case against Armstrong and related how Armstrong threatened him during the 2004 Tour. In its &quot;reasoned decision&quot; announcing Armstrong&#x27;s ban, USADA harshly criticized Armstrong&#x27;s behavior during the incident, which it called a &quot;sad moment in cycling.&quot; It found that Armstrong&#x27;s decision to chase Simeoni down was &quot;dangerous and impetuous,&quot; since it put him at serious risk of an accident. Moreover, it found that Armstrong had engaged in &quot;attempted witness intimidation,&quot; which was in and of itself a violation of the World Anti-Doping Code.

Armstrong confessed to doping in January 2013. When asked about the confession, Simeoni said: &quot;I acknowledge Armstrong&#x27;s confession on television but he put me through such a humiliating experience and damaged me so much, in terms of sport, morale, and finances that I don&#x27;t know if I could ever forgive him.&quot;

Simeoni was played by Belgian former professional cyclist Kevin Hulsmans in the 2015 film &quot;The Program&quot;.

<text>Calamity is a board game released by Games Workshop in 1983.

==Development==
The game was co-designed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, along with Ian Livingstone and Derek Carver, and patterned after the world of high-risk insurance.

==Gameplay==
It features a standard &quot;Monopoly&quot;-style playing track, although players complete the track only once per game.

==Reception==
J C Connor reviewed &quot;Calamity!&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;This is an easy game to learn but requires skill and experience to win in a convincing fashion.&quot;

<text>The Guaracara River, located in south Trinidad, runs westward approximately 30 km long, out of the Central Range and drains into the Gulf of Paria. It forms the boundary between the city of San Fernando (to the south) and the Couva-Tabaquite-Talparo Regional Corporation. In local terms it separates Marabella (the northernmost portion of the city) from Pointe-à-Pierre.

The river is heavily polluted, both by non-point agricultural and residential run-off from Marabella and the town of Gasparillo, and from industrial waste (primarily oily run-off) from the oil refinery at Pointe-a-Pierre owned by Petrotrin (the state-owned oil company).</text><links>
