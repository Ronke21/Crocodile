<text>In Love and Death is the second studio album by American rock band the Used. It was released on September 28, 2004, and was later certified platinum in the United States, indicating over 1,000,000 copies shipped. It is their most commercially successful album to date. The title and music reference a number of tragic events that surrounded vocalist Bert McCracken during the album&#x27;s production, notably the death of his pregnant girlfriend. &quot;In Love and Death&quot; is the final studio album to feature drummer Branden Steineckert.

==Background==
The Used released their self-titled debut album in June 2002 through major label Reprise Records. Frequent touring across the United States helped the band build their fan base. Soon afterwards, the band appeared at Warped Tour and Ozzfest, and was included in larger-sized package tours. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; in February 2003, vocalist Bert McCracken said the group was aiming to record their second album at the end of the year. McCracken added that they planned to write it in the same manner they did for their debut: &quot;We&#x27;re going to go back to Utah and jam at [drummer] Branden [Steineckert]&#x27;s house&quot;.

A DVD/CD package, &quot;Maybe Memories&quot;, followed as a stop-gap release to tide the group&#x27;s fans over until their next album. The band subsequently spent a few months in Orem, Utah writing material for the next album. McCracken said the group &quot;figured it would be best to be in an environment we were really used to&quot;. In January 2004, MTV reported that the group would begin working on their second album within the next month. In February, it was reported that it would be released in June or July. A proposed UK tour with Head Automatica scheduled for February 2004 was cancelled when their frontman had a flair up of Crohn&#x27;s disease.

==Production==
&quot;In Love and Death&quot; was recorded at Foxy Studios in Los Angeles, California with producer John Feldmann in mid-March. Feldmann also acted as an engineer with assistance from Mark Blewett and Alan Hessler. Throughout most of the sessions, the band members argued about the album&#x27;s direction, and had a confrontation with Feldmann on multiple occasions. Steineckert explained that there was &quot;always some kind of butting-heads going on, whether it was big or little stuff&quot;, which &quot;created this underlying tension throughout the record&quot;. In addition, two of McCracken&#x27;s close friends died during the sessions. McCracken said &quot;everything that went into the record — me having lost two friends, tension within the band and tension with our producer — was mostly positive because it all made the songs come together like magic&quot;.

One of McCracken&#x27;s lost friends was his ex-girlfriend Kate, who was pregnant with his child. Prior to her death of a drug overdose, the pair had split up but &quot;decided to keep the baby and try to stay friends and work it out&quot;. McCracken said her death &quot;had a huge impact on the way the record turned out&quot;. Feldmann and McCracken wrote string arrangements for the album. Sean Ingram of Coalesce contributed additional vocals to &quot;Sound Effects and Overdramatics&quot;. Additional programming was done by Danny Lohner, Josh Eustis and Steineckert on &quot;Take It Away&quot;. Digital editing was done by Anthony Catalano. Feldmann mixed the recordings, which were then mastered by Joe Gastwirt at Ocean View Digital Mastering.

==Composition==
Prior to recording, McCracken claimed there would be &quot;a lot more piano-based songs than guitar-riff rock songs&quot; on the album. He added that they &quot;definitely want to keep it eclectic and mix it all up&quot;, incorporating each members different taste in music. He said the album &quot;definitely still [sounds like] the Used&quot; and that the group &quot;went [into] a lot of different places that I never thought we would go for sure&quot;. He added that there was &quot;a lot [of] brighter tones and ... dance-y rhythms&quot;. Similar to their debut, he said &quot;a lot of the songs are personal but ... written in a way that you&#x27;re not gonna necessarily know what I&#x27;m talking about, but you&#x27;ll definitely be able to get involved and make it your own&quot;. Overall, he said it was &quot;all about loss and love and tragedy and just regular everyday things we all go through&quot;.

The album&#x27;s sound has been described as emo, punk rock and alternative rock. &quot;I Caught Fire&quot; is about &quot;looking closely at a relationship that you kind of cherish&quot;, according to McCracken. McCracken said &quot;All That I&#x27;ve Got&quot; is about &quot;moments in time. The more I&#x27;ve thought about living, I realize that our lives are made up of seconds and moments and memories&quot;. McCraken wrote &quot;Hard to Say&quot; about his ex-girlfriend Kate two years prior. Following her death, the group &quot;decided for sure&quot; about its inclusion on the album. McCracken added it &quot;means a lot to me because of all the good times I shared with her&quot;. &quot;Cut Up Angels&quot; is about &quot;a relationship with someone you love so much that you could absolutely kill them&quot;, according to McCracken. Discussing &quot;Lunacy Fringe&quot;, McCracken said the track reminded him of &quot;[the Cure&#x27;s] &#x27;Lovecats&#x27; meets [Soft Cell&#x27;s] &#x27;Tainted Love&#x27; a little bit&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==
On July 9, 2004, the band&#x27;s second album announced for released late August under the rumoured title &quot;Light with a Sharpened Edge&quot;. The following week, it was clarified that the album would be titled &quot;In Love and Death&quot;. Between late July and early September, the band performed on the Projekt Revolution tour. During it, the band played &quot;Take It Away&quot; and &quot;Listening&quot;. In early August, the band filmed a music video for &quot;Take It Away&quot; in Toronto with Motion Theory. On August 5, it was announced that the album&#x27;s release date was pushed back to late September. A preview clip of &quot;Take It Away&quot; was posted online on August 12. &quot;Take It Away&quot; was released to radio on August 23, and on the iTunes Store the following day. On August 27, the album&#x27;s track listing was revealed. On September 24, the band posted two songs on their PureVolume account: &quot;Sound Effects and Overdramatics&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Fake&quot;. &quot;In Love and Death&quot; was released on September 28 through Reprise Records. McCracken dedicated the album to his ex-girlfriend Kate, who had died during recording.

McCracken said the album&#x27;s artwork features &quot;blood hearts, weeping trees and bony monsters&quot;, which were drawn by Alex Pardee. The band were fans of his work and upon contacting him, he was enthusiastic about working with them. He visited the group, heard some of the songs and &quot;didn&#x27;t hold anything back. And that&#x27;s why his artwork is so connected with these songs&quot;. Allman said the style of it was &quot;really noisy and really splotchy. There&#x27;s a lot of character and a lot of sweetness to it, but it&#x27;s also plenty dark&quot;. To promote the album, the band appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and went on a series of in-store acoustic performances and signings. On October 6, the album was released in Japan with a bonus track, &quot;The Back of Your Mouth&quot;. In October and November, the band went on a headlining tour of the US with Head Automatica, Atreyu, The Bronx, and The Bled supporting on select dates.

On November 16, the band filmed a music video for &quot;All That I&#x27;ve Got&quot; in Los Angeles with director Marc Webb. In early December, the band performed at Q101 Chicago&#x27;s Xmas festival. &quot;All That I&#x27;ve Got&quot; was released as a single on December 7. The video for the track was later finished in January 2005. Later that month, the band went on a tour of the UK; Head Automatica was due to support but had cancelled due to illness. At the end of the tour, &quot;Take It Away&quot; was released as a single in the UK. Two versions with B-sides were released: one featuring live recordings of &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; and Take It Away&quot;, while the other featured &quot;All That I&#x27;ve Got&quot;. On February 12, &quot;I Caught Fire&quot; was released as a single. From mid-February to early April, the band headlined the Taste of Chaos tour in the US. On April 13, a cover of Queen and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Under Pressure&quot; as a single, in which they collaborated with My Chemical Romance. The track was recorded to benefit victims of the 2004 tsunami in Asia. The album was re-released on May 10, with &quot;Under Pressure&quot; as a bonus track.

Following this, the band performed two shows in Australia and appeared at Download Festival. In late June, the band filmed a music video for &quot;I Caught Fire&quot; with director Kevin Kerslake in Los Angeles. The video was subsequently released on August 15. McCracken said that in contrast to the fairy-tale-esque video for &quot;All That I&#x27;ve Got&quot;, the video for &quot;I Caught Fire&quot; had &quot;a more straightforward approach&quot; with the group &quot;just kind of rock[ing] it out&quot;. MTV wrote that the video &quot;intersperses footage of the Used performing in a &#x27;shadowy, mysterious place&#x27; with artfully shot scenes of couples making out&quot;. In August and September, the band went on a headlining US tour with support from Thirty Seconds to Mars and Street Drum Corps. Glassjaw was also due to support but dropped off shortly before the tour began when their frontman fell ill. They were replaced by H2O, though Glassjaw were able to appear on one of the dates later in the trek. In October and November, the band headlined the International Taste of Chaos tour which visited Mexico, Australia, Japan, the UK and Germany.

==Reception==

&quot;In Love and Death&quot; sold 93,240 copies in its first week, charting at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By February 2006, the album had sold over 642,000 copies. It was subsequently certified gold in Australia, Canada and the US, and certified silver in the UK. The album charted at number 4 in Canada, number 34 in Australia and number 106 in the UK. &quot;Take It Away&quot; charted at number 13 on the Alternative Songs chart and number 44 in the UK. &quot;I Caught Fire&quot; charted in at number 43 in Australia and number 191 in the UK. &quot;All That I&#x27;ve Got&quot; charted at number 19 on the Alternative Songs chart, number 35 in Australia and number 105 in the UK. &quot;Under Pressure&quot; charted at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number 28 on the Alternative Songs chart; it remains the band&#x27;s only song to have charted on the Hot 100.

The album has been generally well received by critics. Billboard said that it &quot;continues to straddle the line between street credibility and mainstream success&quot;. The Guardian gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying &quot;Songs of self-abuse and suicide - and those are the sunnier moments - are wrapped in wailing riffs, big choruses and fiddly guitar solos.&quot;

<text>Lee Joseph Fogolin (born February 7, 1955) is a Canadian-American former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League. He played for the Buffalo Sabres and the Edmonton Oilers, appearing in 924 NHL regular season games between 1974 and 1987, winning the Stanley Cup in 1984 and 1985.

==Early career==

Fogolin played from 1972–1974 with the Oshawa Generals of the OHA, scoring 52 points in 102 games with 240 PIM. He was drafted in the first round, 11th overall, of the 1974 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres.

Fogolin chose to play for the Team USA in the 1976 Canada Cup, and was invited again in 1984, but declined to play.

==NHL playing career==
Fogolin played his first professional season (1974–75) in Buffalo, but split the next season between the Sabres and the AHL Hershey Bears. He was acquired by the Edmonton Oilers for the 1979–1980 season through the NHL Expansion Draft.

Fogolin played seven full seasons with Edmonton, and was named as captain for the 1981–82 season. He was the first of five Oilers to captain the franchise to the Stanley Cup finals, in 1983, where they lost to the New York Islanders. While a solid defenseman in his own right, he was overshadowed by many of the young stars on the Oilers&#x27; roster, most notably the scoring superstar Wayne Gretzky. Fogolin stepped aside as captain in favour of Gretzky, following the 1982–83 season. Fogolin was a member of the Oilers&#x27; Stanley Cup wins in 1984 and 1985. Fogolin also played in the 1986 National Hockey League All-Star Game.

Fogolin was re-acquired by the Sabres with Mark Napier for Wayne Van Dorp, Normand Lacombe and future considerations near the end of the 1986–87 season, and retired after completing the season with them.

==Personal==

<doc id="1097166" wikidata="Q1951695" url="?curid=1097166" title="Twoism">
<text>Twoism is the debut EP by Scottish electronic duo Boards of Canada, released through their own Music70 label in August 1995 as a limited run of approximately 100 copies.

The EP was out of print until it was re-issued by Warp Records on November 25, 2002.

==Background==

The EP was initially pressed by Boards of Canada&#x27;s own Music70 label on cassette and vinyl in 1995.

Before &quot;Twoism&quot; was re-pressed in 2002, it was a highly sought-after item, being pressed in an edition of approximately 100 copies. It would often be exchanged from one person to the next for around £800 (US$1500).

&quot;Twoism&quot; is the only widely available Boards of Canada release with early third member Chris Horne, who was credited (as Chris H.) on the original release. However, his name was omitted on the 2002 Warp re-released version at his own request. According to credits from Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency he only co-wrote &quot;Melissa Juice&quot;.

==Content==

There are differences between &quot;Sixtyniner&quot; on this EP and other releases, as Boards of Canada have often re-released early songs on later, more popular releases, sometimes with changes. On the original Music70 pressing of the record, &quot;Sixtyniner&quot; lasted 5:40, while reissues shortened it to 5:14.

The channels are reversed on the CD reissue compared to the original vinyl EP. This can also be noted on the tracks &quot;Seeya Later&quot; and &quot;Smokes Quantity&quot;, which have the channels reversed compared to their appearances on &quot;Hi Scores&quot; and &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; respectively.

&quot;Smokes Quantity&quot; includes the hidden track &quot;1986 Summer Fire&quot; at the end. On some pressings, the two tracks are combined.

===Artwork===
The album cover is taken from the 1980 film &quot;The Killings at Outpost Zeta&quot;.

The first pressing of the CD from Warp Records was on a black CD, similar to original PlayStation discs, and included a sticker with the yellow Boards of Canada logo on it. The barcode on the CD&#x27;s digipack was also an easily removable sticker.

==Reception==

Andy Beta of Pitchfork describes how the EP features prescient, beanie-nodding beats and highlights the complexity of certain tracks like &quot;Basefree,&quot; with a surging bass throb and intense hyper-beat. However, it also notes limitations due to the cassette-only format, with some tracks having distorted and fuzzy elements that muddy the overall effect. The review suggests that the music has a strange ecstasy in the vocals and a melancholic feel in some parts. Overall, the review portrays the music as complex and mature, with certain sonic qualities that stand out, but also with some limitations in terms of sonic clarity.

AllMusic said of the reissue, &quot;Excepting only the rigid drum monster &quot;Basefree&quot; (which sounds a bit like Aphex Twin circa 1992), &quot;Twoism&quot; features the same exquisitely spooky, textured emotronica that fans will want to hear, all at as high a level as the brilliant &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; to boot.&quot;

Benjamin Bland writing for Drowned in Sound describes the EP as a charming and youthful record consisting of eight tracks of ambient techno, showcasing the band&#x27;s early musical vision. It highlights the absence of the heavy darkness present in their later work and the uniqueness of each track. Noting how the EP is seen as a sonically incomplete yet fascinating glimpse into Boards of Canada&#x27;s early style, shedding light on their musical evolution over time.

==Track listing==
All tracks written by Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin, except &#x27;Melissa Juice&#x27; co-written by Chris Horne.

<text>The second USS &quot;Blakeley&quot; (DD–150) was a in the United States Navy, named for Captain Johnston Blakeley.

Built in 1918, she saw patrol duty along the East Coast of the United States during the interwar era. Decommissioned for several years, she returned to duty at the outset of World War II. She spent much of the war on convoy patrol duty in the Caribbean Sea. On 25 May 1942, while on patrol, she was struck by a torpedo fired by the German submarine , which blew off her forward . Fitted with temporary measures, she steamed to Philadelphia Naval Yard where she was fitted with the forward section of sister ship . She spent much of the rest of the war on convoy patrol duty before being sold for scrap in 1945.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Blakeley&quot; was one of 111 s built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with 20 of her sisters, were constructed at William Cramp &amp; Sons shipyards in Philadelphia using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works.

She had a standard displacement of an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . On trials, &quot;Blakeley&quot; reached a speed of . She was armed with four 4&quot;/50 caliber guns, two 3&quot;/23 caliber guns, and twelve torpedo tubes for torpedoes. She had a regular crew complement of 122 officers and enlisted men. She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers.

Specifics on &quot;Blakeley&quot;″s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers known unofficially as the &#x27;Liberty Type&#x27; to differentiate them from the destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel, which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. The &#x27;Liberty&#x27; type destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make at instead of the design standard of at . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight.

&quot;Blakeley&quot; was launched on 19 September 1918 by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company in Philadelphia and sponsored by the wife of Charles Adams Blakeley. The ship was commissioned on 8 May 1919. She was the second ship to be named for Johnston Blakeley, the first was a torpedo boat commissioned in 1904. A subsequent would be commissioned, this one a . This third ship would also be named for Charles Adams Blakely.

==History==
Upon commissioning, &quot;Blakeley&quot; immediately joined the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Blakeley&quot; patrolled along the East Coast of the United States until she was decommissioned on 29 June 1922, and returned to Philadelphia. She was recommissioned from 1932 to 1937 to serve with the Scouting Fleet, and then was again decommissioned at Philadelphia. Low military budgets were the cause of these periods of inactivity, as the Navy did not have the funds or manpower to maintain a number of ships, including &quot;Blakeley&quot;.

&quot;Blakeley&quot; was again commissioned on 16 October 1939. She then joined the Neutrality Patrol until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entrance into World War II. She then began convoy duty in the Caribbean Sea, including a February 1942 mission to guard a convoy carrying troops to garrison Curaçao in the Netherlands West Indies.
On 25 May 1942, &quot;Blakeley&quot; was on a patrol off Martinique, inspecting all incoming ships for evidence of activities by Vichy French collaborators alongside her sister ship . At 08:30 a.m., she altered course to pursue a sound ping on her sonar. Nothing was found at the site of the ping, and the crew assumed it was caused by a school of blackfish. As the ship turned to resume its course, it was struck by a torpedo fired by the unnoticed German submarine under the command of Werner Hartenstein. The torpedo struck between frames 18 and 24 at about below her water line. The force of the impact blew off of her forward bow and forecastle. After several minutes, the crew determined they could still operate the ship, and it was brought back under control and sailed for Fort-de-France. The ship was steered with a combination of rudder and varying shaft speeds, and four hours after the attack, she was moored in Fort-de-France. Six men died and twenty one were wounded during the attack. Hartstein radioed a U-boat headquarters in Lorient requesting permission to finish &quot;Blakeley&quot; off, but permission was denied. Destroyers , , and two PBY Catalina planes from VP-53 were scrambled to assist the stricken &quot;Blakeley&quot;.

At Fort-de-France, she was fitted with a wooden bulkhead to cover the area blown off by the torpedo, and an anchor was improvised out of a truck&#x27;s axle and differential housing. She then sailed under her own power to San Juan, Puerto Rico where a steel stub bow was attached. From there, the steamed for Philadelphia Naval Yard for permanent repairs. During mid-1942, &quot;Blakeley&quot; was fitted with the forward section of her decommissioned sister ship, . She was also fitted with newer weapons and electronics systems, such as updated radar. Repairs were completed in September 1942 and she resumed her convoy duties in the Caribbean.

&quot;Blakeley&quot; spent most of the rest of the war on convoy escort duty in the Caribbean Sea Frontier, except for two short deployments in the Atlantic Ocean. On 1 January to 23 February 1943 she was assigned to hunter-killer duty with Task Group 21.13 in the North Atlantic, and from 24 March to 11 May 1943, she escorted a convoy to Bizerte, Tunisia. From 18 March to 13 June 1945, she was stationed at New London, Connecticut, training U.S. submariners in Long Island Sound to avoid destroyers.

Following this duty, &quot;Blakeley&quot; was decommissioned at Philadelphia Naval Yard on 21 July 1945 and sold for scrap on 30 November 1945. She received one battle star for her wartime convoy duty.

<text>Kim Walker (born Kimberly Anne Walker; June 19, 1968 – March 6, 2001), was an American film and television actress. She is best known for her role as Heather Chandler in the 1988 black comedy &quot;Heathers&quot;. Walker&#x27;s sole starring role came in the 1995 independent drama film &quot;A Reason to Believe,&quot; where she portrayed the character Judith.

Walker was born on June 19, 1968, in New York. She attended Grace Church School and Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, where she was classmates with Christian Slater and Jennifer Aniston. She reportedly remained close friends with both Slater and Aniston throughout her life. After high school, Walker and Aniston shared an apartment in Los Angeles during the early stages of their acting careers.

Walker was the daughter of Ruth Mary (née Weigel) and Herb Walker. She died at her home in Studio City on March 6, 2001, at the age of 32, from cerebral herniation due to a malignant glioma. A craniotomy had been performed in January 1999 in an attempt to treat the tumor. She was buried at Pinelawn Memorial Park in Farmingdale, New York. Walker had been diagnosed with the brain tumor several years before her death.

In 2002, the &quot;Kim Walker Memorial Fund&quot; was established at Grace Church School. Walker&#x27;s family established the Kim Walker Shining Star Drama Fund to celebrate her life, her love of performing, and to honor her memory. The annual Kim Walker &quot;Shining Star&quot; Drama Award, created by her mother and brother, honors students with dedication and talent in the performing arts.

<text>Thomas Parran (September 28, 1892 – February 16, 1968) was an American physician and Public Health Service officer. He was appointed the sixth Surgeon General of the United States from 1936 to 1948, and oversaw the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment and Guatemala syphilis experiment. 

==Early life and education==
Parran was born near St. Leonard, Maryland to Benjamin and Mary (Latimer) Parran on September 28, 1892. He was raised on his family&#x27;s tobacco farm. He was tutored at home by a relative and attended St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland, on a scholarship (1911, A.B.; 1915, A.M.). Finances influenced his decision to attend Georgetown University School of Medicine (1915, M.D.) and to follow with an internship at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. A lifelong interest in research was sparked during medical school. He self-identified as Thomas Parran Jr. to distinguish himself from his uncle Thomas Parran, a Maryland politician and U.S. Representative in the Sixty-second Congress (who also had a son named Thomas Parran Jr.). Later in life Parran dropped the Jr. and named his first son Thomas Parran Jr.

==Early career==
Parran volunteered at a health laboratory operated by the District of Columbia, under Joseph J. Kinyoun, founder of Public Health Service&#x27;s Hygienic Laboratory (renamed the National Institute of Health in 1930). Kinyoun recruited Parran to join a field team of young physicians under PHS&#x27;s Leslie L. Lumsden, building privies and surveying conditions in the Southern United States. In March 1917, Parran reported to Okmulgee, Oklahoma, for the first of many assignments in rural sanitation.

After receiving an Assistant Surgeon&#x27;s commission in September 1917, Parran continued on assignments in rural health services administration, sanitation, and the control of communicable diseases; between field assignments, Parran tasted life as an administrator in Washington, DC. In October 1923, he joined a group of young medical officers who attended 6 months of coursework at the Hygienic Laboratory, receiving the practical equivalent of a master&#x27;s degree in public health. Parran&#x27;s first leadership position was as Chief of PHS&#x27;s Division of Venereal Diseases (September 1926), a program begun during World War I. Parran worked to sway public sentiment away from moral condemnation of venereal diseases and toward consideration of syphilis as a medical condition and threat to public health.

His talents in rural health administration would soon lead him temporarily in a new direction. A reform-minded governor, Franklin Roosevelt, requested for Parran to be loaned to the State of New York, where in April 1930 Parran took up his post as state health commissioner. His primary task was chairing a Special Health Commission whose recommendations (1932) provided a framework to bolster county health departments in the face of needs in the Great Depression. Few of the commission&#x27;s recommendations were enacted. Parran&#x27;s work on syphilis achieved more success. The Columbia Broadcasting System inadvertently launched his campaign after radio executives censored the phrase &quot;syphilis control&quot; from a talk, leading Parran to cancel his appearance. Newspapers across the United States reprinted the censored speech.

==Surgeon General==
Parran became active in New Deal politics in New York and entered national politics as well. In 1934, his former supervisor, now President of the United States, Roosevelt, appointed Parran to the Committee on Economic Security, which drafted the Social Security Act of 1935; Title VI authorized millions for public health departments and for biomedical research. After Surgeon General Hugh S. Cumming&#x27;s term, President Roosevelt appointed Parran as Surgeon General of the United States; he was sworn in on 6 April 1936.

Parran&#x27;s syphilis control campaign was in full swing by the fall of 1936. Title VI funds supported efforts to identify and treat syphilis, and the National Venereal Disease Control Act of 1938 made funds available for rapid treatment centers that employed the new sulfa drugs and, later, penicillin. During 1937 his book about syphilis, &quot;Shadow on the Land,&quot; was published and very well received. However, some scholars have argued that his work against syphilis is tainted by the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932–1972) and the Guatemala syphilis experiments (1946–1948), which were conducted by the PHS&#x27;s Division of Venereal Diseases, partially during his tenure as Surgeon General.

During World War II, reports from Europe indicated that the public health situation was dire, prompt action was needed, and a highly qualified medical officer was required to direct the Public Health Division of the Civil Affairs Branch (G-5) of the newly formed headquarters. Because all of the senior Army medical officers with competence in this field were already holding highly important positions, the Army turned to Parran for help, and he released his deputy, Warren Fales Draper, to the military headquarters. Draper became a member of General Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s staff as the Chief of the Public Health Branch and the top public health adviser for Supreme Headquarters, American Expeditionary Forces with the rank of brigadier general.

In addition to syphilis control, Surgeon General Parran left his mark on the scope and structure of public health, both at home and abroad. World War II brought quick expansion and new opportunities for expanded duties. In response Parran and his deputies rewrote the statutes underlying PHS operations, the Public Health Service Acts of 1943 and 1944, establishing a four-bureau structure (consisting of the National Institute of Health, Bureau of State Services, Bureau of Medical Services, and Office of the Surgeon General) that would remain in place through 1967 deftly arranged for the transfer of wartime research contracts from the Office of Scientific Research and Development, creating an extramural grants program for NIH. Parran also served as a mentor to a generation of Public Health Service Commissioned Corps physicians, to whom he gave the leeway to create new institutions and programs in the areas of clinical research into cancer and other conditions, mental health, tuberculosis control, prevention of malaria and other communicable diseases, construction of nonprofit hospitals, and international health. Parran&#x27;s leadership role in international health affairs dated back to the 1930s with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pan American Health Organization. Parran chaired the International Health Conference where the World Health Organization (WHO) draft constitution was adopted (1946) and led subsequent U.S. delegations.

Parran was an early and committed advocate of national health insurance, shielding PHS from direct conflict with those who opposed insurance by tempering his public advocacy with a focus on creating a regionally-organized health services infrastructure to precede federal dollars for care. The Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946 (Hill–Burton Act) was a signal step in this direction. Nevertheless, Parran was attacked by American Medical Association editorialist Morris Fishbein for supporting President Truman&#x27;s proposed national insurance program. Truman&#x27;s decision not to reappoint Parran in the spring of 1948 may have been an outcome of public disputes over this issue. Parran declined the position of Director of the World Health Organization to attempt to maintain the independence of the Public Health Service from the newly created bureaucracy, the Department of Health Education and Welfare. He lost that fight and his job, only to move on again to further advances in the health education field.

==Later life==
On 1 October 1948, Surgeon General Parran retired from PHS as Vice Admiral to begin a career in academic administration, to serve as the first dean of the new School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. Parran made Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania a proving ground for ideas developed during his tenure at PHS, recruiting the school&#x27;s first generation of senior faculty and bringing his deputy surgeon general and veteran international health administrator, James A. Crabtree, who succeeded him as dean in 1958. Beyond his tenure as Surgeon General, Parran remained prominent in international health, active in the Pan American Sanitary Organization and in Rockefeller Foundation programs. On retiring from Pittsburgh in 1958, Parran became president of the Avalon Foundation, affiliated with the Mellon family, and became active in the A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, where he had served as a trustee since 1955. He continued his work in philanthropy and public health until his death in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The home of the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Graduate School of Public Health, Parran Hall, was renamed for Parran in 1969.

A collection of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. Most of his papers concerning his tenure as Surgeon General and his work after are held at the University of Pittsburgh. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery with his second wife Carol.

==Thomas Parran Award==
The American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association named its lifetime achievement award after Parran in recognition of his work to raise awareness of sexually transmitted diseases. However, his role in the early part of the Tuskegee study and in the Guatemala syphilis experiments prompted the association to consider renaming the award. In April, 2013, after some consultation with members, the Association executive renamed the Thomas Parran Award as &#x27;The ASTDA Distinguished Career Award&#x27;.

==Involvement with unethical experimentation==
In June 2018, the University of Pittsburgh announced that it would remove Parran&#x27;s name from the campus building that houses the Graduate School of Public Health due to his involvement in the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study which has a legacy of unethical experimentation. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study took place during his tenure while serving as U.S. Surgeon General from 1936 to 1948, and involved experimentation on African-American adults, children, and people with disabilities without their knowledge or consent. Information about the study and life-sustaining treatment was withheld from 399 Black men with syphilis so researchers could observe the progress of the disease. Over the course of the 40-year study, 28 men died from syphilis, 40 spouses were infected, and 19 children were born with a congenital form of the disease.

An official committee at the University of Pittsburgh reported the following on Parran, who was a founder of the University&#x27;s Graduate School of Public Health: “Dr. Parran’s role, and the extent of his influence in approving, funding, and providing oversight of the Tuskegee and Guatemalan studies, is not entirely clear. Based upon the evidence available today, it might not be possible to determine with certainty Dr. Parran’s level of knowledge and involvement in the studies.”

In a 1947 letter to John Charles Cutler (the lead researcher of the Guatemala STD studies) Parran is quoted as having said &quot;You know, we couldn’t do such an experiment in this country,” which would suggest he was aware of some of the ethical issues in the study.

<text>The Used is the debut studio album by American rock band The Used, released on June 25, 2002, through Reprise Records. The album has been certified platinum by the RIAA in 2019.

==Background==
Jeph Howard and Branden Steineckert played in a local act that performed shows with another band, which featured Bert McCracken. The former band soon broke up; Howard, Steineckert and Quinn Allman formed a new band, Dumb Luck in October 1999. Shortly afterwards, the group split up. The Used formed in January 2001 with Allman on guitar, Howard on bass and Steineckert on drums. The trio, who were in need of a vocalist, held many fruitless auditions. According to Howard, they &quot;remembered [about McCracken] and called him. After that, everything just fell into place.&quot;

Following a period of homelessness, the group recorded a demo release, &quot;Demos from the Basement&quot;. Allman said the group listened back to the demos &quot;over and over, getting stoked talking about what we wanted to do with them&quot;. The group eventually gave a copy to John Feldmann of Goldfinger, &quot;but he would tell us they totally sucked&quot;, Allman added. The band subsequently honed their sound before Feldmann flew the group out to Los Angeles, where they played label showcases without any success initially. However, they soon began to receive offers from record companies. Soon afterwards, the group signed to major label Reprise Records in late 2001. McCracken said the label staff &quot;really seemed to get what we&#x27;re about ... offer[ing] us 100% creative and artistic freedom&quot;.

==Production and composition==
&quot;The Used&quot; was recorded at Foxy Studios in Marina del Rey, California with Feldmann as the producer. The group recorded piano parts in London at Olympic Studios. Feldmann acted as an engineer with assistance from Mark Blewett and Donny Campion. Feldmann contributed backing vocals to &quot;Bulimic&quot; and &quot;Greener with the Scenery&quot;, the latter of which also included additional backing vocals from Carmen Daye. String arrangements on &quot;Greener with the Scenery&quot; and &quot;On My Own&quot; were done by Nick Ingman. Feldmann mixed the recordings, while Joe Gastwirt mastered them at Ocean View Digital Mastering. Steineckert said that &quot;[the] one thing we all took from [working with Feldmann] ... [was] to not lose yourself through everything&quot;.

The album&#x27;s sound has been described as screamo, emo, post-hardcore and melodic hardcore. &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; is &quot;pretty much about being frustrated and maybe biting on a pen&quot;, according to McCracken. McCracken said &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot; was &quot;about a girl. It&#x27;s about drugs. It&#x27;s about loss. It&#x27;s about being alive, about living&quot;. &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; was inspired in part by McCracken&#x27;s past experiences with drugs. He said it was about &quot;drugs and alcohol and loss and love ... and just being stoked that things are always going to get better or always gonna get worse and that&#x27;s such a great thing&quot;. &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot; is about McCracken and Allman&#x27;s friendship, as the latter explains: &quot;When the band started to really pick up ... we were almost not being friends anymore because we were focusing so much time on the band and not on each other&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Used&quot; was released on June 25, 2002 through Reprise Records. During the summer, the group performed on the Warped Tour and Ozzfest touring festivals. Despite never having been released as a single, &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; received airplay starting in July, and a band-directed music video was in rotation at TV stations. In late August, a music video was filmed for &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot;. In October and November, the band supported Box Car Racer on their headlining tour of the US. In early December, the band performed at KROQ-FM&#x27;s Almost Acoustic Christmas festival. In January 2003, the band went on a headlining West Coast tour of the US with support from Taking Back Sunday, New Transit Direction and the Blood Brothers. &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot; was released to radio on January 28. The following day, the band posted the music video to the song on their website. The video was directed by Ami &amp; Kinkski, and features McCracken &quot;play[ing] with fire while the band wreaks havoc&quot;, according to &quot;Kludge&quot;.

The Used embarked on a headlining tour of the US East Coast in February 2003 with support from Finch, the Movielife and My Chemical Romance. This was followed by a co-headlining US with Finch, with support from Steel Train and From Autumn to Ashes. &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; was released as a single on March 11. In March and April, the band went on tour with Coheed and Cambria. In April and May, the group went on tour with Thrice. Two of these shows formed part of MTV&#x27;s Campus Invasion tour. &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot; was released to radio on May 19. From June to August, the group performed at Warped Tour. In July, the group released a CD/DVD album, &quot;Maybe Memories&quot;. The CD included live versions of &quot;Maybe Memories&quot;, &quot;Say Days Ago&quot;, &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; and &quot;On My Own&quot;, Japanese-exclusive bonus track &quot;Just a Little&quot;, a demo of &quot;Bulimic&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes I Just Go for It&quot;, a track that had been recorded during the piano sessions in London.

==Reception and legacy==

Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from critics, with praise being directed primarily to the instrumentation. The album has since become recognized as a landmark album of the emocore and screamo genres. Many bands such as Escape the Fate, Crown the Empire and A Static Lullaby have cited the album as a major influence on their sounds. &quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Emo Albums That Have Resolutely Stood The Test Of Time&quot;. Journalists Leslie Simon and Trevor Kelley included the album in their list of the most essential emo releases in their book &quot;Everybody Hurts: An Essential Guide to Emo Culture&quot; (2007). &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; at number 45 and &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; at number 21 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s. Tom Weaver of Casey has expressed admiration for the album.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Used&quot; debuted at number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums chart in the August 17 issue. It later rose to number one in the November 16 issue and gained &quot;Heatseekers Impact&quot; status when the release moved from number 106 to number 96 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It eventually peaked at number 63 on the chart. Reprise Records&#x27; marketing director Xavier Ramos said the label&#x27;s market strategy for the group was to let their fan base build through touring. He said, &quot;We put them on the road soon after we signed them. Our philosophy was that this is a good live band, and they&#x27;ll win fans over show by show&quot;. &quot;The Used&quot; also charted at number 34 in Australia and number 87 in Germany. It was certified gold in Australia, Canada and the US. &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; charted at number 19 on the Alternative Songs chart and number 52 in the UK. &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot; charted at number 13 on the Alternative Songs chart. &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot; charted at number 23 on the Alternative Songs chart.

By July 2003, the album had sold 500,000 copies.

<doc id="1097186" wikidata="Q501566" url="?curid=1097186" title="Frilled lizard">
<text>The frilled lizard (Chlamydosaurus kingii)&quot;, also known [[Common name|commonly]] as thefrilled agama, thefrillneck lizard, thefrill-necked lizard, and thefrilled dragon, is a [[species]] of lizard in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Agamidae]]. The species is native to northern [[Australia]] and southern [[New Guinea]] and is the [[monotypic|only member]] of the [[genus]] Chlamydosaurus&quot;. Its common names refer to the large frill around its neck, which usually stays folded against the lizard&#x27;s body. The frilled lizard grows to from head to tail tip and can weigh . Males are larger and more robust than females. The lizard&#x27;s body is generally grey, brown, orangish-brown, or black in colour. The frills have red, orange, yellow, or white colours.

The frilled lizard is largely arboreal, spending most of its time in trees. Its diet consists mainly of insects and other invertebrates. It is more active during the wet season, when it spends more time near or on the ground, and is less observed during the dry season, during which it seeks shade in the branches of the upper canopy. It breeds in the late dry season and early wet season. The lizard uses its frill to scare off predators and display to other individuals. The species is considered to be of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Males and females erect their frills during social encounters, which can be seen as a means of communication for the frilled neck lizard. The development of this feature has been linked to not only adaptation but also allometric relationships.

==Taxonomy==
British zoologist John Edward Gray described the frilled lizard in 1825 as &quot;Clamydosaurus kingii&quot;. He used a specimen collected by botanist Allan Cunningham at Careening Bay, off north-western Australia, while part of an expedition conducted by Captain Phillip Parker King in . The generic name, &quot;Chlamydosaurus&quot;, is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;chlamydo&quot; (χλαμύς), meaning &quot;cloaked&quot; or &quot;mantled&quot;, and Latin &quot;saurus&quot; (&quot;sauros&quot;), meaning &quot;lizard&quot;. The specific name, &quot;kingii&quot;, is a Latinised form of King. It is the only species classified in its genus.

The frilled lizard is classified in the family Agamidae and the subfamily Amphibolurinae. It split from its closest living relatives around 10 million years ago based on genetic evidence. A 2017 mitochondrial DNA analysis of the species across its range revealed three lineages demarcated by the Ord River and the southeast corner of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Carpentarian Gap). One lineage ranged across Queensland and southern New Guinea and is sister to one that ranged from western Queensland to the Ord River. The ancestor of these two split from a lineage that populates the Kimberley. Frilled lizards entered southern New Guinea possibly around 17,000 years ago during a glacial cycle, when sea levels were lower and a land bridge connected the island to Cape York. The study upholds &quot;C. kingii&quot; as one species with the different populations being &quot;shallow allopatric clades&quot;.

The following cladogram is based on Pyron and colleagues (2013).

==Description==

The frilled lizard grows to a total length of around and a head-body length of , and weighs up to . It has a particularly large and wide head; a long neck to accommodate the frill; long legs and a tail that makes most of its total length. The species is sexually dimorphic, males being larger than females and having proportionally bigger frills, heads and jaws. The corners of the frilled lizard&#x27;s eyes are pointed and the rounded nostrils face away from each other and angle downwards. Most of the lizard&#x27;s scales are keeled, having a ridge down the centre. From the backbone to the sides, the scales alternate between small and large.

The distinctive frill is a flap of skin that extends from the head and neck and contains several folded ridges. When fully extended, the frill is disc-shaped and can reach over four times the length of the animal&#x27;s torso in diameter, or around across. When not extended, the frill wraps around the body, like a cape over the neck and shoulders. The frill is laterally symmetrical; the right and left sides are attached at the bottom in a V-shape, and cartilage-like connective tissue (Grey&#x27;s cartilage) connects the top ends to each side of the head near the ear openings. The frill is supported by rod-like hyoid bones, and is spread out by movements of these bones, the lower jaw and Grey&#x27;s cartilage. This structure mainly functions as a threat display to predators and for communication between individuals. It can also act as camouflage when folded, but this is unlikely to have been a consequence of selection pressure. The frill may be capable of working like a directional microphone, allowing them to better hear sounds directly in front of them but not around them. There is no evidence for other suggested functions, such as food storage, gliding or temperature regulation.

Frilled lizards vary between grey, brown, orangish-brown, and black dorsally, the underside being paler white or yellow. Males have a dark belly but a lighter chest. The underside and lateral sides of the species are sprinkled with dark brown markings that merge to create bands on the tail. The colours of the frills vary based on range; lizards west of the Ord River have red-coloured frills, those living between the river and the Carpentarian Gap have orange frills, and those east of the gap have yellow to white frills. New Guinean frilled lizards are yellow-frilled. The more colourful frills have white patches which may add to the display. Colouration is mainly created by carotenoids and pteridine pigments; lizards with red and orange frills have more carotenoids than those with yellow and white frills, the latter two are also lacking in pteridines. Yellow colouration has been linked to higher steroid hormones.

==Distribution and habitat==
The frilled lizard inhabits northern Australia and southern New Guinea. Its Australian range stretches from the Kimberley region of Western Australia east through the Top End of the Northern Territory to Queensland&#x27;s Cape York Peninsula and nearby islands of Muralug, Badu, and Moa, and south to Brisbane. In New Guinea, it lives in the Trans-Fly ecosystem on both the Papua New Guinean and Indonesian sides of the island. The species mainly inhabits savannahs and sclerophyll woodlands. It prefers highly elevated areas with good soil drainage and a greater variety of tree species, mostly &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species, and avoids lower plains with mostly &quot;Melaleuca&quot; and &quot;Pandanus&quot; trees. Frilled lizards also prefer areas with less vegetation on the ground, as they can then better spot prey from above.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The frilled lizard is a diurnal (daytime) and arboreal species, spending over 90% each day up in the trees. It spends as little time on the ground as possible, mostly to feed, interact socially, or to travel to a new tree. Males move around more, per day on average versus for females at Kakadu National Park. In the same area, male lizards were found to have an average home range of during the dry season and during the wet season; females used and for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Male lizards assert their boundaries with frill displays. Frilled lizards are capable of moving bipedally and do so while hunting or to escape from predators. To keep balanced, they lean their heads far back enough, so it lines up behind the tail base.

These lizards are more active during the wet season, when they select smaller trees and are more commonly seen near the ground; during the dry season, they use larger trees and are found at greater heights. Frilled lizards do not enter torpidity during the dry season, but they can greatly reduce their energy usage and metabolic rate in response to less food and water. Body temperatures can approach . The species will bask vertically on the main tree trunk in the morning and near the end of the day, though in the dry season they cease basking at a lower body temperature to better maintain energy and water. When it gets hotter during day, they climb higher in the canopy for shade. Frilled lizards will use large trees and termite mounds as refuges during wildfires. After a forest is burnt, the lizards select trees with more continuous canopies.

Frilled lizards primarily feed on insects and other invertebrates, and very rarely take vertebrates. Prominent prey includes termites, ants and centipedes; termites are particularly important food during the dry season, and moth larvae become important during the wet season. Consumption of ants drops after early dry season fires but rises following fires later in the season. This species is a sit-and-wait predator: it watches for potential prey from a tree and, upon seeing it, climbs down and rushes towards it on two legs before descending on all four to grab and eat it. After feeding, it retreats back up a tree. 

Frilled lizards face threats from birds of prey and larger lizards and snakes. When threatened, the species erects its frill to make itself look bigger. This display is accompanied by a gaping mouth, puffing, a puffed up skin, hissing, and tail lashes. The lizard may also flee and hide from its predators. Several species of nematode infest the gastrointestinal tract. There is at least one record of an individual dying of cryptosporidiosis.

Frilled lizards can breed during the late dry and early wet seasons. Competing males display with gaping mouths and spread frills. Fights can ensue, in which the lizards pounce and bite each other&#x27;s heads. The female digs a shallow cavity to leave her eggs. They can lay multiple clutches per season, and the number of eggs in a clutch can vary from four to over 20. The incubation period can last two to four months, with milder temperatures producing more males and more extreme temperatures producing more females. Hatchlings have proportionally smaller frills than adults. Lizards grow during the wet season when food is more abundant, and males grow faster than females. Juvenile males also disperse further from their hatching area. The species reaches sexual maturity within two years; males live up to six years compared to four years for females.

==Conservation==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the frilled lizard as of least concern, due to its abundance and wide range, but warns that its population may be locally declining in some areas. It is a popular species in the pet trade, which may threaten some wild populations. Most pet lizards appear to come from Indonesia, as export of them is banned in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Nevertheless, the Indonesian government themselves have allocated the frilled lizard as a protected species under the Article 20 of the Environment and Forestry Ministerial Regulation On Types of Protected Plants and Animals. Being difficult to breed in captivity, many presumed captive bred lizards are likely to have been taken from the wild. Frilled lizards may also be threatened by feral cats, though they do not appear to be significantly affected by the invasive cane toad.

==Relationship with humans==

The frilled lizard is considered to be among the most iconic Australian animals along with the kangaroo and koala. Archaeological evidence indicates that frilled lizards were eaten by some indigenous peoples in ancient times. In the late 19th century, William Saville-Kent brought a live lizard to England where it was observed by fellow biologists. Another specimen was kept at a reptile display in Paris, as reptiles were becoming more popular in captivity.

== In popular culture ==
Because of its unique appearance and behaviour, the creature has often been used in media. In Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, the dinosaur &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; was portrayed with a similar neck frill that rose when attacking. Its image has been used in the 1994 LGBT-themed film &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;. The species has been featured on some Australian coins. The Pokémon Heliolisk and Helioptile are based on the frilled lizard.

<text>USS &quot;Biddle&quot; (DD-151) was a in the United States Navy during World War II, later reclassified AG-114. She was the second ship named for Captain Nicholas Biddle.

==Design==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved derivative of the previous s, with a higher speed of specified in order to match the s and s authorized under the Naval Act of 1916. Fifty &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers were authorized under the 1916 act, but with World War I demonstrating the need for large numbers of destroyers for anti-submarine operations, further orders were placed, with a total of 111 &quot;Wickes&quot; and 156 of the very similar s finally built. Two different designs to meet the specifications were drawn up by Bethlehem Steel (used by the Fore River and Union Iron Works subsidiary shipyards of Bethlehem) and by Bath Iron Works (used by all other shipyards and unofficially known as the &#x27;Liberty&#x27; design). The two designs differed mainly in the machinery used.

The ships were long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of at full load, with a similar flush-decked hull form to that used in the &quot;Caldwell&quot; class. Displacement of the Cramp-built &quot;Wickes&quot;-class ships was normal and full load. Four White-Forster water-tube boilers fed steam to geared sets of Parsons steam turbines, and drove two propeller shafts. The machinery had a designed power of . Performance of the Cramp-built ships exceeded contractual requirements for range and speed. &quot;Biddle&quot; reached a speed of on sea trials.

&quot;Biddle&quot; had a main gun armament of four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts, with it being planned to mount two 1-pounder autocannon for anti-aircraft defense, but there was a shortage of these guns, and many ships of the class were fitted with two 3-inch/23-caliber gun instead. &quot;Biddle&quot; only had a single 3-inch gun in 1935. Torpedo armament consisted of twelve 21-inch torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. The ship had a crew of 122 officers and other ranks in 1920. This had increased to 149 by 1945.

During World War II, the ship was re-armed to improve abilities as an escort. Two banks of torpedo tubes were removed to allow six 20 mm Oerlikon cannon and a heavier depth charge armament (six depth charge throwers) to be fitted. In addition, a boiler was removed to allow more fuel to be carried, increasing range, although reducing speed to about .

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Biddle&quot; was authorised in 4 March 1917 with the contract for her construction signed on 8 September 1917. The ship was laid down at William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, Philadelphia shipyard on 22 April 1918, and was launched on 3 October 1918, sponsored by Miss Elise B. Robinson, a great-great-grandniece of Captain Biddle. The ship was commissioned on 22 April 1919.

==Service history==
Following her commissioning, &quot;Biddle&quot; made a cruise to the Mediterranean Sea. In February 1920, she assisted in the evacuation of Odessa, which was on the point of capture by the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. &quot;Biddle&quot; returned to New York on 1 July 1920. After assignment to Division 48, Atlantic Fleet, she carried out cruises along the east coast until decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 20 June 1922. She remained laid up until recommissioned on 16 October 1939. Until November 1940 she served on patrol duty with Destroyer Division 66, Atlantic Squadron, and on training duty with Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. She patrolled in the Caribbean Sea under orders of the Commandant, 15th Naval District (November 1940-May 1941) and then rejoined Destroyer Division 66 patrolling out of Key West, Florida.
&quot;Biddle&quot; spent March 1942-February 1945 on convoy duty in the Caribbean except for two short periods. On 5 August 1943, &quot;Biddle&quot; made Sonar contact with a submarine northwest of Trinidad and attacked with depth charges, but the submarine, the German , escaped from &quot;Biddle&quot;″s attacks by using a decoy, but was sunk after a series of sustained air attacks on 7 August. &quot;Biddle&quot; formed part of anti-submarine TG 2.13 from 18 January 1944 to 27 February 1944 and escorted a convoy to North Africa from 24 March 1944 to 11 May 1944. During the latter mission, 11–12 April, while fighting off an air attack, she had seven men wounded by a strafing attack by a German plane. &quot;Biddle&quot; operated off the east coast, March–July 1945, on training exercises with motor torpedo boats. She was reclassified a miscellaneous auxiliary (AG-114) on 30 June 1945, and arrived at Boston Navy Yard on 15 July for conversion. Her conversion was completed just as the war with Japan ended and she remained at Boston until decommissioned on 5 October 1945. She was sold for scrap on 3 December 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Biddle&quot; received one battle star for her service with Convoy UGS-37.

<text>Leonard Andrew Scheele (July 25, 1907 – January 8, 1993) was an American physician and public servant. He was appointed the seventh Surgeon General of the United States from 1948 to 1956.

==Life==
===Early years===
Scheele was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana. While in high school, he worked in his father&#x27;s pharmacy and planned to enter medicine. For his undergraduate education, Scheele chose the University of Michigan (B.A., 1931) over Indiana University, citing the former&#x27;s medical reputation. While at Michigan, he became a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. He ended up following his future spouse, then a dental student, to Detroit. He received his M.D. in 1934 from the Detroit College of Medicine and Surgery (now the Wayne State University School of Medicine).

===Career===
Scheele graduated at the height of the Great Depression. Inspired by one of his medical school professors, who taught preventive medicine and directed the laboratories at the Michigan State Health Department, Scheele followed up on a recruitment visit by Public Health Service (PHS) officers from Detroit&#x27;s Marine Hospital. Encouraged by his school&#x27;s dean, he competed successfully for an internship at Chicago&#x27;s Marine Hospital (1933–1934). Once Scheele accepted a commission as an Assistant Surgeon (July 2, 1934), he began a series of rotations at quarantine stations, in San Francisco and San Pedro, California and at Honolulu, Hawaii, where a light schedule of duties included inspecting aircraft at Pearl Harbor.

The New Deal and the National Cancer Act of 1937 transformed public health, and Scheele&#x27;s career. Reassigned to Washington, DC during 1936, Scheele came to the attention of then-Surgeon General Thomas Parran, Jr. and one of his top lieutenants, Joseph Walter Mountin, who choose Scheele to join a new Division of Public Health Methods. After a brief field assignment in public health administration (Acting County Health Officer, Queen Anne&#x27;s County, Maryland), Scheele was sent by Mountin for clinical training (1937–1939) in New York City at the Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases (now the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). On his return, Scheele served as officer-in-charge of the new National Cancer Control Program.

He spent World War II on assignment to the military. Days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Scheele was dispatched to the Medical Division of the Federal Office of Civilian Defense, under New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia. From 1943 through 1945 he was detailed to the Medical Department of the Army, where he earned the rank of lieutenant colonel and specialized in health-related governance in occupied territories. Following service in Italy and Africa, Scheele arrived in London in early 1944, where he led the Preventive Medicine Section of the Public Health Branch, Medical Division of the G-5 Division at the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Scheele closed out the war as director of the Health, Welfare, Education and Religion Division of the Allied Control Council in Berlin and received the U.S. Typhus Medal for his work in Germany.

===Surgeon General===

After the war, Scheele moved quickly up the ranks to Surgeon General. Promoted to surgeon and appointed assistant chief of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (1946), he oversaw a new program of grants-in-aid to the states for cancer control work in the areas of biology, biochemistry, biophysics, chemotherapy, epidemiology, and pathology. Scheele&#x27;s skilled diplomacy before the United States Congress in the spring of 1947 netted the National Institute of Health (NIH) a fourteenfold increase in budget appropriation. He was elevated to director of NCI and associate director of NIH (1947), the latter a position created for him.

Scheele served as surgeon general first under a Democratic President, Harry S. Truman, who appointed Scheele as Surgeon General Parran&#x27;s successor on April 6, 1948, and 4 years later under a Republican, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, his former commander during the war. Scheele built on his wartime experience and carried on PHS&#x27;s leadership in international health, leading the U.S. delegations to the World Health Assembly (1949 through 1953) and serving twice as President of the World Health Organization.

But the domestic scene occupied the lion&#x27;s share of his energies. Together with the philanthropists Albert and Mary Lasker and voluntary health organizations like the American Cancer Society, Scheele worked closely with enthusiastic supporters in Congress to bring biomedical research fully into the fold of public health practice. NCI provided a working model, and a categorical approach organized about specific diseases became the means. Legislation enacted during 1948 made NIH into a plural &quot;Institutes&quot; by adding a National Heart Institute, the National Institute of Dental Research, the National Microbiological Institute (predecessor to the Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institute), and the National Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine (renamed the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases in 1950), followed by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness (1950) and a 500-bed Clinical Center to link bench research with patient care (1953). Lay representation on national advisory councils, construction grants for laboratories, and extramural research grants each contributed to the growing scientific and institutional authority of NIH. He was also a loving great-grandfather.

Scheele also inherited projects begun before 1941, whose formal implementation had been delayed by the war, including the transfer of the Interior Department&#x27;s health bureau for American Indians (1954), the transfer of the Department of Defense&#x27;s Armed Forces Medical Library (1956, renamed the National Library of Medicine), and new programs to control water pollution (1948), ionizing radiation (1948), and air pollution (1955).

Scheele&#x27;s administrative skills helped PHS weather two public controversies that dominated 1950s America: fluoridation of public drinking water supplies and outbreaks of polio that followed a government-sanctioned vaccination campaign. These issues highlighted the importance of political consensus and public acceptance in evaluating the costs and benefits of public health interventions. Following decades of research and the success of a 1945 clinical trial involving Grand Rapids, Michigan school children, PHS gave formal support to fluoridation as of June 1950, and Scheele issued his public, unqualified recommendation on April 24, 1951, enhancing PHS&#x27;s public credibility and further elevating the role of the Surgeon General as a spokesperson for health.

On the other hand, controversy surrounding failed batches of polio vaccine threatened to destroy public faith in the Federal health establishment. After the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis sponsored a successful national trial of Jonas Salk&#x27;s vaccine in Ann Arbor, Michigan (1954), PHS had released licensing standards for the vaccine and approved six manufacturers to begin production. Scheele and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) Secretary Oveta Culp Hobby released this long-awaited news at a press conference on April 12, 1955, the tenth anniversary of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s death from complications of polio. Health departments around the country administered over 10 million doses, 90 percent to elementary school-aged children, until weeks into the public health campaign, reports came in of fresh cases among vaccinated children and their contacts. Amid growing public furor, Scheele took action. On April 27 he requested that one of the manufacturers, Cutter Laboratories, recall its vaccine and he created a new Poliomyelitis Surveillance Unit at the Communicable Disease Center (CDC) and a national infrastructure for case reporting from the states. During May Scheele halted the national campaign until the remaining vaccines were cleared. Relative scarcity of the vaccine created public health crises of another sort: most vaccinations were held off until autumn, giving CDC time enough to evaluate the revised safety regulations but also leading to a political falling out between Hobby and the United States Congress.

===Later life===
The following August (1956) Scheele resigned from his post as Surgeon General, to become President of Warner-Chilcott Laboratories, then part of the Warner-Lambert Company of Summit, New Jersey. As a private sector executive, he continued to serve his country, for example, travelling to Cuba on behalf of the John F. Kennedy Administration, to arrange for the transfer of millions of dollars of medicines, public health and food supplies in exchange for the release of hostages taken during the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. After his retirement from Warner-Lambert, Scheele returned to the Washington, D.C., where he died on 8 January 1993.

<text>The Student Radio Association (SRA) is a representative body which supports and acts on behalf of the UK student radio community, comprising radio stations that are associated with or linked to a place of education. It is a not-for-profit organisation, which exists to encourage and facilitate communication between student stations. It was dissolved by Companies House in May 2018, but was reincorporated on 30 August 2019 as the Student Radio Association Ltd Ltd.

==History==

The SRA was formed following the liquidation of the National Association of Student Broadcasting (NASB), which was formed as a limited company on 5 August 1988. NASB, a Private company limited by guarantee, was dissolved in January 2002, although had collapsed as a business in 1991. That year saw the creation of the SRA as a community. In November 2007, the SRA was incorporated as a Private Company Limited by Guarantee. There are 65 member stations of the SRA, which includes student radio stations across the UK. Membership to the SRA is on a yearly basis.

The SRA receives support from a number of industry partners, some which have been associated with the organisation for many years. The Radio Academy provides free membership for SRA members. Students involved with the SRA automatically become part of the Association of Student Radio Alumni (ASRA) following their graduation, which is a network of people formerly involved in student radio. Other associated organisations include Global Media &amp; Entertainment and BBC Radio, which provides speakers at SRA events.

==The SRA Officers==

The SRA is run by officers that have various roles within the organisation. The SRA is governed by an elected executive team, with elections held annually and voted by the station managers of member stations. The latest elections took place online, with the following individuals elected to office from July 2024:
*Chair – Summer Wilde
*Operations Officer – Jon Rodney-Jones
*Network Officer – Jack Corbett
*Marketing and Communications Officer – Ruby Stillman
*Membership Officer – Cameron Conner
*Events Officer – Ben Swift

Administrative roles within the SRA are chosen by the departing executive team. The SRA also appoints regional officers that provide support for stations in a region of the UK. Candidates for regional officers are elected to the role following a vote by the station managers in their region.

==The Student Radio Awards (SRAs)==

The Student Radio Awards (SRAs) is an awards scheme celebrating talent within the UK student radio industry, held annually since 1995 and supported by BBC Radio 1, the ASRA and Global Radio. The awards are announced in a ceremony in November, with past presenters including well-known radio personalities, such as Fearne Cotton, Scott Mills, and Nick Grimshaw. The first awards took place at the University of London Union. Due to the increased popularity of the event, the SRAs moved to The indigO2 in London in 2008. The awards on offer range from Best Newcomer, Best Interview, and Best Live Event, up to the most prestigious, Best Student Station of the Year. The current Awards Chairperson is Huw Stephens. Previous chairs have included Stephanie Hirst, Steve Lamacq, and Dev (DJ).

In 2008, the Kevin Greening Creativity Award was introduced to reward students that had displayed new and innovative radio. The award is named in honour of Kevin Greening, a former chair of the awards and presenter on Cambridge University Radio. Greening co-hosted The Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Zoë Ball from 1997 to 1998, prior to his death in 2007.

As well as student radio award trophy, winners of the best male and female awards are also given the chance to host a show on BBC Radio 1. In 2012, female winner Hattie Pearson, from Fuse FM, covered an early morning breakfast slot on the station on 29 March 2013. Best male winner Ethan O&#x27;Leary, from Spark FM, covered the same show on 1 April 2013. Also in 2012, Abbie McCarthy, from RaW 1251AM, was offered free training from the BBC Academy after winning the Best Newcomer trophy. Many past winners of Student Radio Awards have gone on to become big names within the UK radio industry, most notably Greg James (Winner Best Male 2005), who now works at Radio 1, and Mark Crossley (Winner Best Male 2008), who now works at Absolute Radio.

==SRA Conference==

Each year, the SRA holds a conference, usually during the University Easter break. Each year, member stations submit a conference proposal to hold the conference at their university. The SRA committee selects the winning station towards the start of each year. The conference takes place over 3 days and is funded through ticket sales. At the SRA Conference, speakers are invited to speak on a variety of subjects, including the future of Student Radio and radio techniques. Speakers are invited from radio organisations, such as the head of BBC Radio 1 Aled Haydn Jones.

From 2010, the &#x27;Amplify Awards&#x27; (formerly &#x27;I Love Student Radio&#x27; awards) have been held at the conference. These are in addition to the SRAs and are dedicated to rewarding the people behind the scenes of student radio. Awards include the &quot;Most Improved Station&quot;, which was won in 2024 by Fuse FM. As well as the awards, the SRA annual general meeting is held at the conference.

<doc id="1097194" wikidata="Q708259" url="?curid=1097194" title="Comedian Harmonists">
<text>The Comedian Harmonists were an internationally famous, all-male German close harmony ensemble that performed between 1928 and 1934 as one of the most successful musical groups in Europe before World War II. The group consisted of (tenor buffo), (first tenor), Erich A. Collin (second tenor), Roman Cycowski (baritone), (bass), and (pianist).

The hallmark of the Comedian Harmonists was its members&#x27; ability to blend their voices together so that the individual singers could appear and disappear back into the vocal texture. Its repertoire was wide, ranging from the folk and classical songs arranged by Frommermann to appealing and witty popular songs of the day by writers such as Peter Igelhoff, Werner R. Heymann and Paul Abraham.

==History==
In 1927, unemployed actor Harry Frommermann was inspired by The Revelers, a jazz-influenced popular vocal group from the United States, to create a German group of the same format. According to Douglas Friedman&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;The Comedian Harmonists&quot;, in August 1929 both groups appeared on the same bill at the (former ) and became good friends. Frommermann held auditions in his flat on Stubenrauchstraße 47 in Berlin-Friedenau, and, once the group was assembled, it quickly began rehearsals. After some initial failures, the Harmonists soon found success, becoming popular throughout Europe, visiting the United States, and appearing in 21 films.

The members of the group were:
The group&#x27;s success continued into the early 1930s, but eventually ran into trouble with the Nazi regime: three of the group members – Frommermann, Collin, and Cycowski – were either Jewish or of Jewish descent, and Bootz had married a Jewish woman. The Nazis progressively made the group&#x27;s professional life more difficult, initially banning pieces by Jewish composers, and finally prohibiting them from performing in public. The group&#x27;s last concert in Germany was in Hanover on March 25, 1934, after which they sailed to the United States on and gave several concerts. Fearing internment if they stayed abroad, however, they eventually returned home amid bitter internal disputes.

Frommermann, Cycowski, and Collin subsequently fled Germany and formed a new group in Vienna, which performed under the names &quot;Comedian Harmonists&quot; and &quot;Comedy Harmonists&quot; with a new pianist, bass, and high tenor. The remaining members in Germany likewise replaced their counterparts in a successor group named &quot;Das Meistersextett&quot; (as the authorities forbade an English-language name). Neither group was able to achieve the original success of the Comedian Harmonists, with the German group stifled by political in-fighting and heavy censorship, as well as the war draft (call-up). The emigrant group toured extensively all across Europe (excluding Germany and, from 1938 on, Austria), but also in the Soviet Union, South Africa, South America, and Australia where they were particularly successful and considered settling down since the Australian government had offered them citizenship. However, after a North American concert tour in 1940, they were unable to return to Australia. Their last concert was in Richmond, on May 1, 1940. After that, they were unable to find work in America due to hostility toward German entertainers, and the group split up.

The Bulgarian Asparuh Leschnikoff (also spelt Leshnikov) returned to his fatherland in 1938 and started a successful career. By 1941, both groups had broken up. Although all members survived the war, they never re-formed after the war.

Erich Collin created a new group in the late 1940s, consisting of himself (now as a baritone), Jack Cathcart (Piano), Fred Bixler (First Tenor), Murray Pollack (Second Tenor), Nicolai Shutorev (Buffo) and Arthur Atkins (Bass). When Shutorev died unexpectedly while the group was on tour in Norway in September 1948, Erich Collin asked Harry Frommermann to jump in as a replacement, and so two of the original Comedian Harmonists were reunited on stage. They continued the tour and recorded six songs for the label &quot;Le Chant du Monde&quot; in Basel in 1949. Shortly afterwards the group disbanded, allegedly due to a lack of discipline among the American members.

The group remained largely forgotten until filmmaker created a four-hour black-and-white television documentary, in which he interviewed the surviving members in 1975, who were scattered throughout the world. The documentary aired over two nights in German in 1977 and caused a resurgence of interest in the music of the Comedian Harmonists, with their records being released on vinyl. In 1979 Erwin Bootz and Robert Biberti received the certificate and the trophy of the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis in the category Historic Recordings/Entertainment for the double-LP, , Odeon 1 C 148-32 974 M .

They won recognition from the musical entertainment industry in 1998 when they won an honorary award of the Echo Music Prize from the .

==Dramatic representations==
They were the subject of the 1997 German movie &quot;Comedian Harmonists&quot;, released in the United States in 1999 as &quot;The Harmonists&quot;. In the film, actors lip synched to the musical performances of the group&#x27;s original recordings.

The 1997 film directly led to a musical play about the group, &quot;Veronika, der Lenz ist da – Die Comedian Harmonists&quot;, which opened at the Komödie in Berlin in December 1997. When this production closed, the actors who had played the original sextet formed a new group called the Berlin Comedian Harmonists, which recreates the Comedian Harmonists&#x27; repertoire.

In 1998, the story of the Comedian Harmonists was depicted in documentary musical theater, in a production entitled &quot;Band in Berlin&quot; performed at the American Music Theatre Festival in Philadelphia. The production, which then played for three weeks at Broadway&#x27;s Helen Hayes Theater in March 1999, featured the singing group Hudson Shad.

&quot;Harmony: A New Musical&quot; about the Comedian Harmonists, with music by Barry Manilow and book and lyrics by Bruce Sussman, premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse in the fall of 1997, and played at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta from September 6, 2013, to October 6, then moved in early 2014 to the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. The National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene in New York City mounted &quot;Harmony&quot; during March to May 2022, directed by Warren Carlyle. In April 2023 it was announced that the show would open at Broadway&#x27;s Ethel Barrymore Theatre on November 13 of that same year. Receiving mixed-to-positive reviews, the production, staged by Warren Carlyle and featuring Chip Zien and Julie Benko, closed on February 4, 2024.

<text>Leroy Edgar Burney (December 31, 1906 – July 31, 1998) was an American physician and public health official. He was appointed the eighth Surgeon General of the United States from 1956 to 1961.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Burney was born in Burney, Indiana, a town founded by his great-grandfather. He began premedical coursework at Butler University (1924–26) and completed both undergraduate and medical training at Indiana University Bloomington (Bachelor of Science, 1928; Doctor of Medicine, 1930). An introduction to the Public Health Service (PHS) came through a one-year internship at the Chicago Marine Hospital. Initiation into the world of public health followed when Burney took advantage of a fellowship to study at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health (Master of Science, 1931). Courtesy of the renowned epidemiologist Dr. W. H. Frost and the Rockefeller Foundation, Burney was allowed to extend his studies for six months of field work at the Joint Health Department of Charlottesville, Virginia, immunizing preschool children against diphtheria.

===Career===
Burney, a resident of Charlottesville, sought for and was approved as an Assistant Surgeon in the PHS Regular Corps (1932). His area of expertise would be public health administration at the state and local level, the front lines of public health. Like many of his generation at PHS, Burney came up through the ranks of then-Surgeon General Thomas Parran, Jr.’s venereal disease control programs, receiving specialized training at the New York Marine Hospital (1934) and assisting in the management of rapid treatment centers around the country. Burney helped establish the first PHS mobile venereal disease clinic, in Brunswick, Georgia (1937–39), bringing access to treatment for African Americans, whom Jim Crow segregation excluded from the predominantly white locations of other facilities.

Burney spent most of World War II stateside, where he served as Assistant Chief of PHS&#x27;s Division of State Relations (1943–44), except for a five-month detail to the Navy, where he traveled to the Mediterranean on behalf of the War Shipping Administration, to address infectious disease problems affecting ports. After the war, Burney continued his work with state and county health departments, directing PHS&#x27;s New Orleans district office (1945) and then accepting a detail to be State Health Commissioner and Secretary of Indiana&#x27;s new State Board of Health (1945–54) and teach at the Indiana University School of Medicine. In 1954 Burney returned to PHS as an Assistant Surgeon General and Deputy Chief of the Bureau of State Services, overseeing grants-in-aid to the states while being prepared for leadership by then-Surgeon General Leonard A. Scheele.

===Surgeon General===
When Surgeon General Scheele stepped down in August 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Burney on a recess appointment, and was sworn in as Surgeon General on August 8, 1956, and later confirmed by the Senate in January 1957. Surgeon General Burney applied his administrative know-how to steer PHS successfully through institutional growing pains as the agency responded to new and, at times, conflicting demands from the public, professional and voluntary advocacy groups, the parent Department, and the Congress. The key issues of the day were environmental health and access to health services, the former driven by widely shared alarm over deteriorating environmental conditions and fallout from the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons and the latter by expectations that national health insurance would soon be realized. In many ways the Kerr-Mills Act of 1960, which authorized government financing of services for senior citizens without adequate means to pay for care, prefigured the Medicare and Medicaid programs that would transform national policy during the following decades.

In response, Burney mustered his leadership to gather facts, draft plans for modernizing PHS and take action. Under future Surgeon General William H. Stewart, the Office of the Surgeon General&#x27;s Division of Public Health Methods staffed a number of investigatory and advisory bodies whose reports still inform policy decisionmaking, including the Secretary&#x27;s Consultants on Medical Research and Education (Bayne-Jones report, 1958); the Surgeon General&#x27;s Consultant Group on Medical Education (Bane report, 1959); the Surgeon General&#x27;s Report on Environmental Health Problems submitted to the House Appropriations Subcommittee (1959); and the Study Group on the Mission and Organization of the Public Health Service (Hundley report, 1960). In addition, during July 1957 Public Health Methods began implementing the National Health Survey Act of 1956, conducting the first periodic national surveys of chronic disease morbidity and health services: the triennial Health Interview Survey, and the mobile Health Examination Survey (which in 1971 became the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).

The Hundley Committee report urged that PHS shed the institutional remnants of its early missions (the hospitals and quarantine) and reorganize to better fulfill its post-1940 mandate to promote civilian public health. Unable to obtain formal authority from Congress but with permission from the Secretary of United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Burney began reorienting PHS structure to reflect its new functions. The Bureau of State Services was divided into two parts, one devoted to issues related to services delivery, under the rubric of &quot;community health,&quot; and the other devoted to environmental health. Environmental programs were consolidated and upgraded, with new Division-level units created for radiological health (1957) and air pollution (1960) and a new National Advisory Committee on Radiation. With the exception of the multidisciplinary National Institute of Mental Health, institutional boundaries were redrawn to distinguish services-oriented programs at the Bureau of Medical Services from research at the National Institutes of Health and from information gathering units such as the National Library of Medicine groundbreaking for Bethesda, Maryland facility in June, 1959 and the National Center for Health Statistics established in August 1960, comprising Public Health Method&#x27;s surveys group and PHS&#x27;s National Vital Statistics Division.

Surgeon General Burney also refashioned his position to emphasize his role as a spokesperson on behalf of public health. In 1957 and again in 1959, he was the first Federal official to publicly identify cigarette smoke as a cause of lung cancer, issuing statements that paved the way for his successor, Surgeon General Luther L. Terry. Traditional public health functions remained no less important. During his tenure Burney played a leadership role in public health affairs both internationally chairing the U.S. delegation to the 1959 World Health Assembly and domestically serving as President of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers. In addition, he supported an effective response by the Communicable Disease Center to the 1957 Asian influenza pandemic and gave ongoing, measured support to the development of the oral polio vaccine developed by Albert Sabin.

===Later years===
On January 29, 1961, shortly after President John F. Kennedy’s inauguration, Surgeon General Burney stepped down from his post to give the new Democratic administration the opportunity to nominate its own choice for Surgeon General. Reforms and ideas raised during Burney&#x27;s administration would become the foundations of health policy under Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. After retiring from PHS, Burney served as Vice President for Health Sciences at Temple University and on the Board of the Milbank Memorial Fund until his retirement in 1990. He died on July 31, 1998, in Park Ridge, Illinois.

<doc id="1097202" wikidata="Q871665" url="?curid=1097202" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Madison">
<text>The Diocese of Madison () is a Latin Church diocese in the southwestern part of Wisconsin in the United States. The diocese has approximately 167,000 Catholics in 102 parishes with 98 priests in active ministry.

As of 2025, the bishop of Madison is Donald J. Hying. St. Bernard Catholic Church is expected to be consecrated as the cathedral in 2025; the previous cathedral, Cathedral of St. Raphael, was destroyed by fire in 2005.

==Territory==
The Diocese of Madison comprises Columbia, Dane, Grant, Green, Green Lake, Iowa, Jefferson, Lafayette, Marquette, Rock, and Sauk counties. The area of the diocese is approximately .

==History==

=== 1630 to 1800 ===
The first Catholic presence in present-day Wisconsin was that of French Catholic missionaries in the Green Bay area in the 17th century. When French explorer Jean Nicolet entered the Green Bay areas in 1634, he was followed by Jesuit missionaries. Wisconsin became part of the French colony of New France.

The first catholic missionary in the Superior region was Reverend René Menard, a French Jesuit missionary who was fluent in the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Huron dialects. In Spring 1661, he explored to Chequamegon Bay on Lake Superior. In 1665, Reverend Claude Allouez started a Catholic mission near Chequamegon Bay, naming it the Mission of the Holy Ghost. In 1669, Reverend Jacques Marquette arrived at the mission after Allouez moved to the Fox River Valley. Marquette baptized over 1,000 converts. In 1669, Allouez and Marquette established St. Joseph in La Pointe, but it was later abandoned.

Allouez celebrated Mass with a Native American tribe near present-day Oconto, Wisconsin in December 1669, the feast of St. Francis Xavier. He established the St. Francis Xavier Mission there. The mission moved to Red Banks for a short time in 1671, and then to De Pere, where it remained until 1687, when it was burned. The missionaries worked with the Fox, Sauk, and Winnebago tribes, protected by Fort Francis near Green Bay. When Fort Francis was destroyed in 1728, the missionaries left the area.

When the British took control of New France in 1763 after the French and Indian Wars, the bishops in Quebec continued to have jurisdiction in the region. In 1791, soon after the conclusion of the American Revolution, Pope Pius VI erected the Diocese of Baltimore. It covered all the American states and the Northwest Territory, which included part of present-day Wisconsin. The rest of Wisconsin became part of the territory after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

=== 1800 to 1843 ===
Catholic jurisdiction for the new Wisconsin Territory passed to the Diocese of Bardstown in 1808, then the Diocese of Cincinnati in 1826. The first new Catholic church in the Wisconsin area in over 100 years was constructed in Fort Howard in 1825. Its parishioners included many French Canadians living in the settlement.

In 1833, the new Diocese of Detroit assumed jurisdiction over the area. In 1837, the missionary Reverend Florimund J. Bonduel traveled from Green Bay to visit the French fur trader Solomon Juneau in Milwaukee. While in Milwaukee, Bonduel celebrated the first mass in that city.

Later in 1837, the Diocese of Detroit sent Reverend Patrick Kelly to Milwaukee to serve as its first resident priest. Kelly celebrated mass in the Milwaukee courthouse until 1839, when he opened St. Peter&#x27;s, the first Catholic church in the city. In 1841, Coadjutor Bishop Pierre-Paul Lefevere of Detroit visited Milwaukee.

===1843 to 1946===
In November 1843, Pope Gregory XVI erected the Diocese of Milwaukee, taking its territory from the Diocese of Detroit. The new diocese covered all of the Wisconsin Territory, including part of present-day Minnesota. During the mid-19th century, Reverend Samuel Mazzuchelli established 11 parishes in the Madison area.

In 1846, Catholic residents of Beloit, Wisconsin, founded St. Thomas the Apostle Parish, the first parish in that city. Wisconsin achieved statehood in 1848. That same year, the first Catholic church in Madison, St. Raphael, was founded.

Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Lacrosse and the Diocese of Green Bay in 1868. The Madison region would remain part of these three dioceses for the next 78 years.

In 1871, the Dominican Sisters of Sinsinawa established the Saint Regina Academy for girls and boys in Madison. Saint Paul&#x27;s Catholic Student Center, serving the University of Wisconsin Madison community, was founded in 1906.

===1946 to 2003===
The Diocese of Madison was established on January 9, 1946, by Pope Pius XII. The diocese was created out of territory from the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and the Dioceses of La Crosse and Green Bay. The pope selected Bishop William O&#x27;Connor from the Diocese of Superior as the first bishop of Madison.

During O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s tenure, the diocese grew from 135 priests serving 82,000 Catholics to 290 priests serving 180,640 Catholics. In his first year as bishop, O&#x27;Connor established the Blessed Martin Guild to promote racial understanding and convert more minorities to Catholicism. He also founded Holy Name Seminary in Madison in 1965. As part of the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s reforms, he established a diocesan priest senate in 1966. O&#x27;Connor resigned in 1967.

In 1967, Pope Paul VI appointed Auxiliary Bishop Cletus F. O&#x27;Donnell from the Archdiocese of Chicago as the second bishop of Madison. He established ministries for the deaf and the developmentally disabled. He also encouraged adult education and created a religious education consultants program to help individual parishes.

After O&#x27;Donnell retired in 1992, Pope John Paul II named Bishop William Bullock of the Diocese of Des Moines to replace him. The pope declared Reverend Mazzuchelli, a pioneer priest in the region from the 19th century, as venerable in 1993. In 1995, Bullock closed Holy Name Seminary. Bullock retired in 2003.

===2003 to present===
Bishop Robert C. Morlino from the Diocese of Helena was named the fourth bishop of the Diocese of Madison in 2003 by John Paul II. Morlino supported the application of &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, an apostolic letter issued by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 on the use of the Tridentine Mass. Morlino celebrated the Tridentine Mass in several parishes. He ordered all the parishes to move the tabernacles in their churches to central places of prominence. Morlino encouraged parishioners to receive communion on the tongue while kneeling, and he encouraged pastors to enlist exclusively male altar servers.

One of Morlino&#x27;s main objectives was to increase the ordination of priests in the diocese. He helped raise $44 million for the endowment fund &quot;Priests for Our Future&quot;. The number of seminarians grew from six to 30 during his episcopate, one of the largest increases in the United States. Catholics in his diocese had divided opinions of him.

In May 2009, Morlino announced that due to budget cuts, he was closing the Catholic Multicultural Center, which provided food and other support for residents on Madison&#x27;s south side. A handoff to local parish administration and fundraising drive was announced one week later.

In March 2009, Morlino dismissed Ruth Kolpack from her post as a pastoral associate at St. Thomas the Apostle in Beloit, citing her alleged breaches of orthodoxy. In a brief meeting with Kolpack, he asked her to take an oath of loyalty to the church. Morlino also demanded that she renounce her 2003 doctoral thesis, which advocated women&#x27;s ordination in the Catholic Church and the use of inclusive language relating to God. Morlino fired Kolpack after she refused this last demand. Morlino died in 2018.

The current bishop of the Diocese of Madison is Donald J. Hying of the Diocese of Gary. He was appointed by Pope Francis in 2018. In 2023, Hying announced the grouping of all the parishes into 30 pastorates to be run by multiple priests. This reorganization was meant to relieve some of the administrative duties of the diocesan priests.

===Cathedral fire===
In March 2005, St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral was heavily damaged in an arson attack. William J. Connell was arrested and charged with arson and other crimes, but was deemed incompetent to stand trial due to paranoid schizophrenia. After later being deemed competent, he was tried and convicted. In June 2007, Connell was sentenced to 15 years in prison followed by 15 years of close supervision.

In April 2007, Bishop Morlino released plans to erect a new cathedral on the existing site. However, the plans were never realized. In March 2023, Bishop Hying announced that he had petitioned the Vatican to designate St. Bernard Catholic Church in Madison as the new cathedral, and Pope Francis elevated the church the same year. St. Bernard&#x27;s is expected to be consecrated as the cathedral in 2025.

===Reports of sex abuse===
In September 2003, at a legislative hearing in Madison, a woman from Sun Prairie accused Reverend Gerald Vosen, pastor of St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church in Baraboo, of sexually assaulting her brother when he was age 14 in the 1970s. Vosen, who denied the accusations, was put on leave by the diocese. The diocesan review board reviewed three allegations against Vosen and in February 2003 recommended the permanent suspension of his ministry. In May 2004, Vosen unsuccessfully sued one of his accusers. His appeals of the review board decision were declined in 2007 and in 2015 by the Vatican.

An Eau Claire man sued the diocese in February 1994, claiming that he had been sexually assaulted by Reverend Michael Trainor in the summer of 1982. The crime allegedly happened in the rectory of St. Thomas Aquinas Church. Trainor left Wisconsin in 1994 after several parents brought accusations to Bishop Bullock. By February 1995, seven other men had joined the lawsuit, claiming abuse by Trainor. The plaintiffs claimed that Bishop O&#x27;Donnell was aware of Trainor&#x27;s abuse of children and transferred him from one parish to another without reporting him to the police or parishioners. A separate suit by nine other men against the diocese regarding Trainor was filed in September 1995. The lawsuits were dismissed in 1995. New allegations of abuse against Trainor were brought to the diocese in 2002 and 2003.

In May 2018, Reverend William Nolan, a retired priest, was charged with six counts of sexual assault. He was acquitted in September 2019 of five of these counts, with the judge dropping the remaining count. The diocese also investigated Nolan and later cleared him from the designation of &quot;credibly accused&quot; priest in March 2020 as well.

In June 2019, the diocese agreed to assemble a list of credibly accused clergy who served in the diocese and hired investigators to assist in this investigation. In March 2020, Bishop Hying announced that they had found two credible sexual abuse allegations against Reverend Patrick Doherty, a retired priest. Hying had previously placed restrictions on Doherty.

==Schools==
===High schools===

===Grade schools===
* St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School in Baraboo is a parochial school. The current school building, designed by the Wisconsin Rapids company Billmeyer and Sons and with a cost of over $500,000, has 11 classrooms. The basement has a cafeteria and a combination auditorium/gymnasium. The second building for the school opened on a filled-in ravine in 1912, northeast of its associated church. The building had three floors and a basement. The first and second floors each had three classrooms, and the second floor also housed the chapel and the library. The third floor had a 600-seat auditorium while the basement had a large banquet hall/gymnasium. The second building became overcrowded due to the post-World War II baby boom, so the third school building, north of the second building, opened in 1958.

<text>The Angel&#x27;s Command is a 2003 novel by Brian Jacques, author of the popular children&#x27;s series &quot;Redwall&quot;, and the sequel to &quot;Castaways of the Flying Dutchman&quot;. It follows the adventures of an immortal boy and his dog as they face pirates and other dangers from the high seas to the mountains.

==Plot summary==
The &quot;Castaways of the Flying Dutchman&quot; trilogy is based on the legend of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. It tells of how a young boy and his dog managed to escape the fate that befell the ship and its crew. Instead, they were given eternal life, the ability to speak in any tongue, and the ability to talk to each other with their thoughts. Ben, the boy, and Ned, the dog, are sent on a mission to help those in need.

In &quot;The Angel&#x27;s Command&quot;, they meet up with a French buccaneer and try to help him fulfill his dream of returning home. Ben and Ned are beset by challenges, and the last one causes the death of their dear friend. Afterwards, they meet up with two other young people, Dominic and Karay. They help an old count find his lost nephew, Adamo, who is captive to the Razan, a clan of robbers living in the Pyrenees, led by an old witch. Ned, Ben, Karay, and Dominic manage to rescue Adamo. Nevertheless, the boy and his dog must move on, and their story continues. The novel was followed by a sequel in 2006 titled &quot;Voyage of Slaves&quot;.

Calderón and confirmed by the Puerto Rico Senate.

Chief Justice Hernández Denton is the chairperson of the Board of Bar Examiners of Puerto Rico and the president of the Commission of Judicial Evaluation. As chief justice, he presided the Constitutional Board that was responsible for redistricting the Puerto Rico Senate and House of Representatives in light of the 2010 Census results.

<text>David Appell (March 24, 1922 – November 18, 2014) was an American musician, arranger and record producer born in Philadelphia.

==Career==
Appell (pronounced &quot;AP-el&quot;) is associated mainly with the Cameo-Parkway record label, in whose history he played a substantial part. He started working as an arranger for several United States Navy big bands in the mid-1940s during his service in World War II, including Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s black orchestra.

He later arranged for dance orchestras, including Benny Carter and Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines. He recorded for a while on Decca Records as the Dave Appell Four, until Paul Cohen of Decca suggested he change the group name to the Applejacks. Appell also became a publisher, joining ASCAP in 1955, collaborating with Max Freedman.

He appeared prominently in the 1956 Alan Freed film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot;, and worked for a while as the studio band and music director on the Ernie Kovacs TV and radio shows in Philadelphia. Next Appell and the Applejacks were playing in Las Vegas, but they soon began to pine for their hometown and returned to Philadelphia, where they started working for Cameo Records, a label founded by Kal Mann and Bernie Lowe. 

Appell did background vocals, session work as a guitarist, engineering, arranging and producing. The first hit artist on the Cameo label was Charlie Gracie with &quot;Butterfly&quot;. Appell&#x27;s band backed Gracie on that million-seller in 1957, and on the singer&#x27;s subsequent hits, &quot;Fabulous&quot;, &quot;Ninety-Nine Ways&quot; and &quot;Wander in&#x27; Eyes&quot;. In 1958 Appell and his group backed John Zacherle on his Top 10 novelty hit &quot;Dinner With Drac&quot;.

In the summer of 1958, Appell got an idea for a song from the Philadelphia String Band of a marching-type song with a dance beat. He wrote an instrumental song called &quot;The Mexican Hat Rock&quot;, a jumped-up version of the old &quot;Mexican Hat Dance&quot;, that he had his studio band record. The song was released under their own name on Cameo that fall and became a big dance hit on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, reaching # 16 on the charts. The Applejacks also charted with &quot;Rocka-Conga&quot; (# 38) later in the year.

Appell went on to become the leader of Cameo-Parkway&#x27;s house band, backing such artists as Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell, The Dovells, Dee Dee Sharp and The Orlons. In the cases of the aforementioned act&#x27;s records Appell also arranged and, in many instances, produced, and even co-wrote with Kal Mann, songs such as &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot;, &quot;Bristol Stomp&quot;, &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot;, and &quot;South Street&quot;. These were the years of the twist and other dance crazes, in the launching of which Appell played a vital role. Appell left Cameo in 1964.

In the 1970s he had success with his productions for Tony Orlando and Dawn, including the # 1 hits &quot;Knock Three Times&quot; (1970) and &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot; (1973), on Bell Records in New York City. Appell&#x27;s co-producer at the time was Hank Medress, a founding member of The Tokens musical group.

Appell died on November 18, 2014. Cause of death is unknown. He was survived by his children Roz (Robert Purdy) Appell Purdy, Lynda Appell and granddaughter Sara Millett.

<text>Albert Johnson ( – February 17, 1932), also known as the Mad Trapper of Rat River, was a fugitive whose actions stemming from a trapping dispute eventually sparked a huge manhunt in the Northwest Territories and Yukon in Northern Canada. The event became a media circus as Johnson eluded the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) team sent to take him into custody, which ended after a pursuit lasting more than a month and a shootout in which Johnson was fatally wounded on the Eagle River, Yukon. Albert Johnson is suspected to have been a pseudonym and his true identity remains unknown.

== Attack on police ==
Albert Johnson arrived in Fort McPherson after coming down the Peel River on July 9, 1931. He was questioned by RCMP constable Edgar Millen, but provided little information. Millen thought he had a Scandinavian accent, generally kept himself clean-shaven, and seemed to have plenty of money for supplies. After venturing the waterways in an indigenous-built raft to the Mackenzie River delta, he built a small cabin on the banks of the Rat River. Johnson had not acquired a trapping licence, which was considered odd for someone living in the bush. At that time many northern native traditional trapping areas were being invaded by outsiders fleeing the Great Depression and some complaints may have been intended to remove him.

In December, indigenous trappers complained to the local RCMP detachment in Aklavik that &#x27;Johnson&#x27; was tampering with their traps, tripping them and hanging them on the trees. A post incident investigation by the RCMP &quot;found an entirely different story. Evidently, Johnson had roughly told them to take off and had even pointed a gun at them, when they came-a-visiting at Johnson&#x27;s cabin&quot;.

On December 26, Constable Alfred King and Special Constable Joe Bernard, each of whom had a considerable northern experience, trekked the to Johnson&#x27;s cabin to ask him about the allegations. Seeing smoke coming from the chimney, they approached the hut to talk. Johnson refused to talk to them, however, seeming not even to notice them. King looked into the cabin window, at which point Johnson placed a sack across it. The two constables eventually decided to return to Aklavik and get a search warrant.

King and Bernard returned five days later with two other men. Johnson again refused to talk and eventually King decided to enforce the warrant and force the door. As soon as he began, Johnson shot him through the wooden door. A brief firefight broke out, and the team managed to return the wounded King to Aklavik where he eventually recovered.

== Manhunt ==
A posse was then formed consisting of nine men, 42 dogs and of dynamite which they intended to use to blast Johnson out of the cabin if necessary. After surrounding the cabin they thawed the dynamite inside their coats. The common version states that this charge was thrown onto the roof of the cabin, collapsing it in the following explosion. After the explosion, the men tried to rush in. Johnson opened fire from a five-foot dugout beneath the ruins. No one was hit, and after a 15-hour standoff (ending at 4:00 A.M.) in the weather, the posse retreated to Aklavik for further assistance. Again, the RCMP investigative report partially contradicts this, claiming that the dynamite charge barely damaged the cabin, but it was later purposely destroyed to prevent him from returning to it, which may have led to the impression by some that the blast had destroyed it.

By this point, the news had filtered out to the rest of the world via radio. After being delayed because of blizzard conditions, the reinforced posse returned on January 14 to find that Johnson had left the cabin, and the posse struck out after him. Eventually, they caught up with him on January 30, surrounding him in a thicket. In the ensuing firefight, Johnson shot Constable Edgar Millen through the heart, killing him. Millen was later to have a tributary of the Rat River, Millen Creek, named for him. A memorial is located in the area. Once again they fell into retreat. The posse continued to grow, enlisting local Inuvialuit and Gwich&#x27;in who were better able to move in the back country. Johnson had clearly decided to leave for the Yukon, but the RCMP blocked the only two passes over the Richardson Mountains. That did not stop Johnson, who climbed a peak and once again disappeared.

In desperation, the RCMP hired First World War flying ace and leading post-war aviator Wilfrid &quot;Wop&quot; May of Canadian Airways to help in the hunt by scouting the area from the air. He arrived in the new ski-equipped Bellanca monoplane on February 5. May discovered that Johnson had crossed the Richardson Mountains when the airplane saw his tracks on the far side of the range. On February 14, he discovered the tactics Johnson had been using to elude his followers. He noticed a set of footprints leading off the centre of the frozen surface of the Eagle River to the bank. Johnson had been following the caribou tracks in the middle of the river where they walked in order to give them better visibility of approaching predators. Walking in their tracks had hidden his footprints and allowed him to travel quickly on the compacted snow without having to use his snowshoes. He left the trail only at night to make camp on the river bank, which is the track May had spotted. May radioed back his findings and the RCMP gave chase up the river, eventually being directed to Johnson by February 17.

== Death ==
The pursuit team rounded a bend in the river to find Johnson only a few hundred yards ahead, standing in front of them. Johnson attempted to run for the bank but was not wearing his snowshoes and could not make it. A firefight broke out in which RCMP Constable Alfred King was seriously wounded and Johnson was killed after being shot in the left side of the pelvis at an acute angle. It is believed that the bullet passed through vital tissues, bowels, and main arteries, which led to his death. May landed the plane, picked up the injured officer and flew him to help for which he was credited with saving his life.

After Johnson&#x27;s death, RCMP officials realized that he had travelled over away from his cabin in 33 days, burning approximately 42 MJ (10,000 kcal) a day in the cold weather and hostile terrain. Seventy-five years later in 2007, forensics teams found that his tailbone was not actually symmetrical, causing his spine to curve left and right slightly. In addition, one foot was longer than the other.
An examination of Johnson&#x27;s body yielded over $2,000 in both American and Canadian currency as well as some gold, a pocket compass, a razor, a knife, fish hooks, nails, a dead squirrel, a dead bird, a large quantity of Beecham&#x27;s Pills and teeth with gold fillings that were believed to be his. During the entire chase, the Mounties had never heard Johnson utter a single word. The only thing they heard was Johnson&#x27;s laugh after he shot Constable Edgar Millen. To this day people debate who he was, why he moved to the Arctic, or if he was actually responsible for interfering with the trap lines as alleged.

== Identity ==
The RCMP sent a series of photographs throughout Canada and the United States in an unsuccessful effort to learn his real identity, which has never been definitively established.

In the 1930s, the initial investigation about the identity of Albert Johnson primarily focused on an obscure individual named Arthur Nelson. Details of Nelson&#x27;s life were recorded by Yukon researcher and author Richard North. Nelson apparently travelled from Dease Lake, British Columbia, up into the Yukon in the 1927 to 1931 period. He had similar guns (a Savage Model 99, a .30-30 Winchester calibre lever action rifle, a sawn-off Iver-Johnson 16 gauge shotgun and a sawn-off Winchester Model 58 .22 Long Rifle) as Albert Johnson. Nelson was also remembered by Kaska Dena elders Art John Sr. and others who knew him by the alias &quot;Mickey Nelson&quot; when he trapped and prospected in the Ross River region in west-central Yukon.

North&#x27;s 1989 book &quot;Trackdown&quot; put forward his theory that Albert Johnson, Arthur Nelson, and a North Dakota repeat criminal by the name of John Johnson were one and the same person. John Johnson did time in San Quentin Prison and Folsom Prison, and his physical description is well documented and similar to the Mad Trapper&#x27;s. North traced John Johnson&#x27;s identity back to Norway. &quot;Johnny Johnson&quot; was born Johan Konrad Jonsen (1898) in Bardu Municipality in Norway, north of the Arctic Circle. However, the Mad Trapper&#x27;s expensive dental work were not likely to belong to the criminal Johnson. Also, DNA tests involving John Johnson&#x27;s great-nephew Ole Getz disproved that Johnny Johnson and the Mad Trapper were the same people.

The Johnston family of Pictou, Nova Scotia have long believed that Albert Johnson is actually Owen Albert Johnston, a relative who had left Pictou at the beginning of the Great Depression to find work in the United States. The family&#x27;s last letter from Johnston was posted from Revelstoke, British Columbia early in 1931. They never heard from him again. According to a 2009 radio interview a relative was arranging for DNA tests.

Previous theories were challenged with the release of Mark Fremmerlid&#x27;s book &quot;What Became of Sigvald Anyway&quot;. He proposed too many coincidences to ignore the possibility of Sigvald Pedersen Haaskjold from Norway emerging as Albert Johnson. Sigvald was last known as a highly self-sufficient 32-year-old in 1927, years before the chase and death of Albert Johnson, who was estimated between 35 and 40 years. Sigvald had become obsessed with the notion that the authorities were still looking for him after evading conscription during the First World War. He had built a fortress-like cabin on Digby Island on the north coast of B.C. before disappearing. This author points out circumstantial evidence for this case.

In August 2007, a forensic team assembled by Myth Merchant Films located and exhumed Johnson&#x27;s grave near the cemetery in Aklavik, then conducted a modern forensic examination on his remains; these were documented in the documentary film &quot;The Hunt for the Mad Trapper&quot; and the book &quot;The Mad Trapper: Unearthing a Mystery&quot; by Barbara Smith.

This team found that isotopic analysis of his teeth suggested he may have grown up in Scandinavia or the U.S. Midwest, that he had scoliosis which would have led to chronic back pain, that he was approximately 35 years of age, and that he had been struck multiple times in his final gun battle including his leg, thorax and a debilitating shot from behind through his pelvis. A spiral fracture of his femur supports the anecdote that a bullet had hit and exploded an ammunition pouch on his hip. His dental work was of very high quality for the time suggesting he was able to afford expensive state-of-the-art work at a major centre such as Chicago or New York. DNA samples were also obtained for comparison work.

After the examination his remains were re-interred with full religious rites by both the local priest and native elders, something that had not been afforded to him at his original burial.

While many people had offered convincing circumstantial and anecdotal evidence that they were related to him, the DNA analysis ruled out all of the candidates and his identity remains a mystery.

In 2017, it was decided to attempt a familial DNA investigation; however, technical problems with the DNA eluded analysis until an adequate sequence was developed by Othram Inc. in 2021. Further investigation by Othram traced his ancestors to Sweden, linking him to multiple descendants of Gustaf Magnusson (1776–1853) and Britta Svensdotter (1781–1846), suggesting that he was either their descendant or the descendant of one of their close relatives. Many of his genetic matches traced their ancestry to the Swedish towns of Hånger, Kävsjö and Kulltorp. , further DNA samples and family history were being sought from possible descendants to further the investigation.

== Films and music ==

* In August 2007, Myth Merchant Films produced a documentary of the exhumation of Johnson&#x27;s grave and the subsequent modern forensic examination seeking information about his identity. The documentary was released in 2009. 
*The event is the subject of the songs &quot;The Capture of Albert Johnson,&quot; by Wilf Carter, and &quot;The Mad Trapper of Rat River&quot;, by Stanley G. Triggs on his 1961 album &quot;Bunkhouse and Forecastle Songs of the North West&quot; (Smithsonian Folkways Recordings).
* &quot;Rat River Trapper&quot;, written and performed by Doug Hutton, was released on the 1974 RCMP tribute album &quot;Scarlet and Gold&quot; (Denali Records Ltd.).
* &quot;The Mad Trapper&quot;, a highly fictionalized film based on these events, was released in 1972, and in 1975 &quot;Challenge to Be Free&quot; was released. An American production, it relocated the events to Alaska and referred to Johnson&#x27;s character merely as &quot;Trapper&quot;, or in the theme song, &quot;Trapper Man&quot;. It portrayed Johnson as a man who lived in peace and harmony with wild animals, similar to Johnny Appleseed and whose initial interference with other traps was due to rival trappers&#x27; inhumane techniques.
* Another highly fictionalized version of Johnson&#x27;s story is Charles Bronson&#x27;s 1981 movie &quot;Death Hunt&quot;. The film portrays Johnson as a sympathetic character with freedom-loving values and places Edgar Millen (Lee Marvin) in the role of the antagonist, making him out to be an alcoholic with few scruples who leads the manhunt to capture Johnson rather than being shot and killed by him. Furthermore, bush pilot Wop May is represented as a Royal Canadian Air Force captain, Hank Tucker, who is shot down and killed by the posse after Tucker wildly shoots up members of the posse.

<text>Castaways of the Flying Dutchman is the first novel in the &quot;Castaways&quot; series by Brian Jacques and was published in 2001. It is based on the legend of the cursed ship known as the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. A young boy, Nebuchadnezzar (later Neb (shortened) and Ben (reversed)), and his dog, Denmark (named after the country in which he was found and later Den (shortened) and Ned (reversed)), are the lone survivors of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, fated to wander the earth forever immortal and youthful, helping those who need aid.

The cover art was illustrated by Michael Koelsch. The second and third books in the series, &quot;The Angel&#x27;s Command&quot; and &quot;Voyage of Slaves&quot;, were published in 2003 and 2006, respectively. Koelsch also illustrated the cover art of the third novel.

==Plot summary==

A fourteen-year-old nameless boy, who at the beginning has no parents and is a mute. He is apparently running away from his life as an abused orphan, and accidentally slips on the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; as a stowaway. He is found, and made to work with the cook, Petros, an antagonistic character who abuses him. Petros names the boy Neb, which is short for Nebuchadnezzar. One day, while the crew is off drinking in the port town of Esbjerg, a dog wanders onto the ship and is befriended by Neb. He names the dog Denmark, after the country he found the dog in. They strike up an immediate friendship. Den hides under sacks until it is safe to come out. The cruel, wild, and fearsome Captain Vanderdecken steers his ship on a long voyage to get emeralds from a dealer across the ocean, supposedly in Asia. The ship sails to the tip of South America, the treacherous Cape Horn, and unsuccessfully attempts to pass three times. After the third attempt, Captain Vanderdecken curses the Lord for smiting him, and an angel descends from heaven and curses the ship to sail the seas for eternity.

The angel, however, realizes Nebuchadnezzar and Denmark are pure of heart and not part of the motley, now undead, crew, and has them swept overboard by a great wave. The angel blesses them, telling them to walk the earth forever, wise and forever young, to give kindness and guidance wherever they go. They later wash up on shore and discover that they are able to communicate by thought. They are found and taken in by a kind-hearted shepherd named Luis who grows fond of them, but does not ask about their past. After spending three years with him, Luis dies in a storm trying to save an ewe. The angel appears in a dream telling them that they must move on at the sound of a bell, which they hear jingling on the neck of a sheep walking by. Neb and Den, young but ageless, must leave.

The story picks up many years later. Both characters have changed their names (by reversing them); Neb is now Ben and Den is Ned. It is apparent that they have lived with each other for several centuries. One day, they get on a train without knowing where they are going, and end up getting off at the village of Chapelvale. They meet a lady named Mrs. Winn as well as a boy named Alex and a girl named Amy. The children warn them about the Grange Gang, a group of local bullies. The gang leader, Wilf, takes an immediate disliking to Ben.

Together, Ben, Ned, Amy, Alex, and Mrs. Winn go on a treasure hunt to save the town, which is about to be converted into a limestone quarry and cement factory. They team up with an old ship&#x27;s carpenter named Jon (who is at first believed to be a madman), a milkman named Will, and Will&#x27;s family. They follow a series of clues written by Mrs. Winn&#x27;s ancestor, who was believed to have been given the deeds to the town. One clue leads to a treasure (which is a Byzantine artifact) and another clue and continues that way until three treasures and clues have been found. The last clue, of course, is the hardest and is the last thing that may show them the location of the deeds to Chapelvale.

The deeds to the village are found and Mrs. Winn is able to claim Chapelvale as her property so that it can be saved. However, the angel appears once again and informs Ben and Ned that they must leave Chapelvale and their friends at the sound of a bell. Jon finds a bell in the Almshouse and becomes excited about the discovery. He and Will decide to try the bell out. Ben and Ned run as fast as they can, hoping that if they cannot hear the bell they will not have to leave, but they cannot get away in time. However, they must move on.

<text>Mike Pedicin (born Michael L. Pedicine; October 24, 1917 – June 26, 2016) was an American saxophonist and jazz bandleader. He initially performed in the idiom of swing music, before switching to heavily influenced R&amp;B-flavoured dance music, becoming an early pioneer of rock and roll in a similar vein of Bill Haley.

==Biography==

Pedicine was born the son of a barber in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and was one of four. He started playing the saxophone at age 9. By the age of 10, he was a regular on the local radio show The Horn &amp; Hardart Children&#x27;s Hour. He appeared on the show for eight years.
In the 1950s and 1960s, during the summer, Mike&#x27;s band played at various night spots in Somers Point, NJ. Tony Marts &amp; Bay Shores, the two most popular spots. His best-known record was a cover version of Faye Adams 1953 hit &quot;Shake a Hand &quot; (released by Cameo Records, 1958).

Pedicin, a resident of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, died of pneumonia in June 2016 at the age of 98.

<text>Goat Island is a heritage-listed island located in Port Jackson, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Located northwest of the Sydney central business district, Goat Island is about 300m wide in a north/south direction and 180m long in an east/west direction; and covers an area of . Goat Island lies off the shores of the Sydney suburbs of Balmain and Millers Point, at the junction of Darling Harbour with the main channel of Sydney Harbour.

The island is a former gunpowder storage, arsenal, bacteriology station, shipyard, powder magazine, maintenance facility and accommodation and now interpretation centre and education facility. Over the years Goat Island has served as a quarry, convict stockade, explosives store, police station, fire station, boatyard and film set. Today the island forms part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. The built facilities on the island were designed by Edmund Blacket and Alexander Dawson and built from 1826 to 1994. Goat Island is also known as Memel or Me-Mel, meaning the eye. The property is owned by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

==History==

===Indigenous history=== 
In the Dharug language, Goat Island is also known as Memel or Me-Mel, meaning the eye, by the indigenous Eora people of Port Jackson. Captain David Collins indicated that Bennelong had told him that the island &#x27;was his own property, that it was his father&#x27;s and that he should give it to By-gone, his particular friend and companion&#x27; Bennelong appeared to be &#x27;much attached&#x27; to Memel and was often seen there with his wife Barangaroo. How this property transferred from one person to another in the traditional culture was not recorded and why Bennelong should give it to By-gone, was not recorded. Goat Island is the centre of a constellation of green harbour headlands and islands and, as an easy 500 metre paddle from the mainland, was used often by Indigenous people. The island was the birthplace of Bennelong, the Eora elder who served as intermediary between English settlers and Aboriginal populations.

===Colonial history===
Confusingly, some early maps of Sydney Harbour show the current Goat Island with the name &quot;Cockatoo Island&quot;, whilst the current Cockatoo Island is named &quot;Banks Island&quot;. However, by the late 1820s the naming of the two islands had stabilised at the current situation.

Whilst the use of Goat Island as both a naval arsenal and a convict stockade were discussed during the late 1820s, the first use of the island was in 1831, as a sandstone quarry. This use set the tone for much of the later life of the island, with the first of many bureaucratic disputes between the colony&#x27;s local civil government and the local military establishment who reported directly to the War Office in London. In this case the Surveyor General, Major Thomas Mitchell, objected to the quarrying on the grounds that what was being quarried away was a valuable point for the purpose of defence, and quarrying soon ceased.

By the early 1830s increasing amounts of gunpowder for public works were in storage in Sydney prompting Governor Bourke to implement Darling&#x27;s proposal for the construction of an arsenal or magazine on Goat Island. Its convenient location, isolation from the centre of population, ability to be made secure and accessibility for large ships made it an obvious choice. The work was initially supervised by the Commissary, a committee or Board of Works and William Buchanan as Clerk of Works. In 1833 gangs of convicts started work quarrying stone and levelling ground on a site at the south-western side of the island. The powder magazine was completed by January 1839, and is a substantial, stone-built, bomb-proof construction. It was during this original period of construction that the convict Charles Anderson was said to have been kept chained to a rock for two years. A stone cut couch, with fixing points for a platform and the wooden lid said to have provided him with shelter, can still be seen.
Construction began in January 1833 by ironed gangs from the hulk &quot;Phoenix&quot;, who began quarrying to level the ground. In 1834, three portable wooden houses surrounded by a stockade were erected on the island to avoid the loss of time involved in the daily ferrying of the convicts from the hulk. The work went slowly and in May 1835 the foundations were finally commenced. Newly arrived Commanding Royal Engineer George Barney took control of the construction in January 1836 and immediately instructed Thomas Bird to prepare plans of the buildings already underway. In his report to the Inspector General of Fortifications the following month he commented that the plan was defective but that work was so far advanced that work on the buildings would be completed by the end of 1836.

In August 1836 the Legislative Council passed an Act for better regulating the keeping and carriage of gunpowder. Among other things it made the Officers of Ordnance responsible for the custody of gunpowder. Work was completed in January 1839. During construction, the magazine, cooperage, barrack and convict accommodation, wharf, stone walls, well or tank, garden, water channels, wet ditch and blacksmith&#x27;s shop had been erected. Most of these structures are still extant.

In October 1835 the Committee on Police and Gaols recommended that the water police be relocated from Longnose Point to Goat Island. This was finally agreed to in January 1837 when Barney proposed the use of convict labour to construct a wet ditch across a small segment of Goat Island. Colonial Architect Mortimer William Lewis prepared a design for the proposed Water Police station which went to tender in June 1838. The station was constructed at the north-eastern tip of the island and at the opposite end from the magazine. For defensive reasons, and to provide a clear boundary between the domain of the police, part of the colonial civil government, and that of the military magazine, a water level ditch was cut to separate the north-eastern tip of the island from the bulk of the island. This &#x27;cut&#x27; can still be seen today.

===Queen&#x27;s Magazine===
The Ordnance or Queen&#x27;s Magazine on Goat Island was intended to store gunpowder belonging to the British government and by arrangement that owned by the Colonial administration. As a safety measure, the Act William IV, No. 7 of 1836 decreed that privately imported gunpowder in the possession of merchants also had to be stored in government care, pending its use. The Colonial administration arranged that privately owned gunpowder be stored in the Queen&#x27;s Magazine on Goat Island. By 1847, the storage of privately owned gunpowder was causing a problem as it was taking up much of the storage space in the magazine. The problem was exacerbated by the 1840s depression which saw many of the private owners bankrupted. This left the Ordnance with a large amount of deteriorating gunpowder which in 1847 the Colonial Architect was requested to remove. The Colonial Secretary instead requested that the Ordnance permit the construction of a Colonial magazine on Goat Island which was refused. An acrimonious correspondence ensued. The matter was resolved in 1850 when Colonial Architect Edmund Blacket was requested to prepare a plan and estimate for a merchants&#x27; gunpowder magazine on Goat Island. Blacket&#x27;s design abandoned the conventional fireproof barrel vault with its massive walls in favour of a thin-skinned structure with a light roof substantially supported by, and tied to, the interior racking system with conventional windows and shutters at the gable ends. The design was criticised but the administration overruled the objections on the grounds that the design was economic and the construction period would be shorter than using a conventional design.

In 1854 a new Colonial Magazine was constructed to the north of the existing magazine, which became known as the Queen&#x27;s Magazine. This was a building of much lighter construction, and was intended for the storage of civilian explosives belonging to the colonial government and local merchants. In 1864 the police station was converted into a laboratory for the preparation of cartridges, requiring the building of a bridge over the cut. The water police were moved to Kirribilli. In the 1870s magazines were built on the east side of the island to house the new explosive dynamite. By this time most of the storage of propellant powders and cartridge manufacturing had moved to nearby Spectacle Island.

The increase in mining and public works in the second half of the 1850s resulted in an increased demand for gunpowder, which again resulted in the inability of the magazines to cope with storage requirements. This necessitated in the hire of the brig Lady Mary as a temporary floating gunpowder magazine in 1856. In June 1859 it was decided to construct another magazine on Goat Island using Colonial Architect Alexander Dawson&#x27;s 1856 plan. The design was similar to the Colonial magazine, but introduced an iron roof which again raised concern amongst military men. The magazine was completed in December 1859.

In 1861 the Colonial Secretary raised concerns that the quantity of gunpowder stored on Goat Island was sufficient to &quot;send half of Sydney to the other world.&quot; A spectacular explosion in a small store of nitro-glycerine in Bridge Street in 1866 further added to this concern. The Water Police were removed from Goat Island in 1865 and the laboratory for cartridge preparation relocated to the Water Police area in 1866. The use of new blasting preparations such as gun-cotton, nitro-glycerine and lithofracteur at this time further exacerbated these concerns as gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine were more susceptible to accidental explosion. New storage facilities were required as far away from the gunpowder as possible. By 1875 a magazine was erected south-west of the cut, with another to follow by 1878. The laboratory again had to be relocated.

In 1875 the Storage of Gunpowder Board raised concerns with the somewhat casual attitude of safety and security on Goat Island and recommended that the merchants gunpowder be removed. From the 1870s - 1890s considerable alterations and additions were made to structures on Goat Island. Little physical evidence of this work survives.

===Other use===
In 1900 all explosives were removed from Goat Island. The island is believed to have been used for a period in that year as a bacteriology station, for the investigation of the major outbreak of bubonic plague in the nearby Rocks district, but firm evidence for this usage is lacking. What is certain is that by 1901 the island had become the depot for the Sydney Harbour Trust, responsible for the maintenance of that body&#x27;s significant fleet of tugs, dredgers and other floating plant. Over the following years until the mid-1920s, the island saw the construction of a harbour master&#x27;s house on the highest point of the island, together with four cottages for married members of the fireboat crew stationed on the island, and a barracks for the unmarried members of the same crew. The land west of the cut was vested in the Governor of NSW.

In 1901 the island was vested in the newly formed Sydney Harbour Trust who had acquired responsibility for Sydney Harbour. The Trust used Goat Island as a depot constructing wharves, berthing facilities, coal-store, 4 cottages, Harbour Masters Residence and workshop as well as making major alterations and additions to the former barrack and cook house. Between 1925 and 1931 the Trust developed a shipyard which consisted of spillways, installation of cranes, rail system and conversion of the Expense Magazine and Colonial Magazine.

Between 1925 and 1931 the magazine area to the south-west of the island was converted into a shipyard for the repair of the trusts vessels and floating plant. Over the following years this has grown to include four slipways, of , and (x2) capacity respectively, plus a wharf. The Colonial Magazine was recycled as a shipwright&#x27;s workshop, whilst the Queens Magazine became a general store. The Trust was replaced in 1936 by the creation of the Maritime Services Board which had expanded responsibilities encompassing the entire state. Goat Island was the home of the Board&#x27;s Fire Brigade during the war and accommodated 26 men and the families of several of the married men. Plans for a community hall were drawn in 1941 and shark-proof swimming baths was erected. Tennis courts had been erected earlier - possibility in 1937.

===History post World War II===
During the 1940s and 1950s construction of wharf, storage and shipyard facilities were carried out. The island was also a popular centre of social activities such as tennis and dances during this time.

The Maritime Services Board finally relinquished control of the island and in 1995, and in May 1994 administrative control of Goat Island was transferred to the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service (NPWS) for incorporation into Sydney Harbour National Park. The sub-district office of the NPWS Sydney Harbour Islands is now located on Goat Island.

In October 2016, the state government announced its intention to return the island to Aboriginal hands. Premier Mike Baird said &quot;Goat Island has enormous cultural heritage significance for Aboriginal people. We are committed to ensuring Aboriginal leadership in management and decision-making for the sustainable use of Goat Island.&quot; The government has taken its first steps to transfer management and ownership of the island to its traditional owners. The Premier will establish a working group to investigate means of transferring management while continuing existing operations on the island, protecting its heritage and maintaining public access. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating has long campaigned for the island&#x27;s return. Former state MP Linda Burney&#x27;s last question to Parliament before she left for federal politics was about returning ownership of the island. Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Leslie Williams said &quot;future opportunities (included) increasing public access and sharing cultural experiences&quot;. On 29 May 2022, the NSW Government announced that Goat Island would be returned to Aboriginal ownership within four years. Prior to this, $42 million is to be spent on the island&#x27;s restoration, including repairs to seawalls and buildings as well as upgrades to the wharf, access and services, and the removal of asbestos.

== Description ==
Goat Island is located in Sydney Harbour, west of the Harbour Bridge between McMahons Point and Balmain. Goat Island is a prominent island in Sydney Harbour. There is little vegetation on the island.

=== Condition ===

By December 2000, the condition of fabric varied from good to poor. Some of the metal in roofs and cranes such as the hammerhead crane were rusting. Termites had attacked some of the timber structures. The archaeological potential of Goat Island is high. The integrity and intactness is high. The structures retain enough of their original fabric to enable their form, function and interrelationships to be easily read and understood.

=== Modifications and dates ===
Considerable modifications have been made to many of the structures. Many of structures are not in original condition and have been altered or have had major additions added in accordance with the needs of the various occupying authorities.

==Goat Island in popular culture==

During the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, the island was used as a film-set for the Australian television series &quot;Water Rats&quot;.

The island has also played host to rock concerts from Midnight Oil in 1985 and Green Day in 2000. Both were presented by radio station Triple J. Goat Island recently reopened to the public, with tours available on weekdays. Goat Island was also included in the 2010 Crave Sydney International Food Festival&#x27;s Sydney Harbour Island Hopping Tour.

&quot;Panic at Rock Island&quot;, an Australian telemovie, was filmed on the island in 2010. On 24 March 2011, Foo Fighters performed a secret show on the island to 300 people. On 19 November 2013 Kings of Leon performed on the island in front of 600 people presented by Foxtel&#x27;s Channel V.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 24 March 2000, the Colonial Magazine is historically significant as probably the oldest surviving magazine built to store merchant&#x27;s powder in Australia, evidence of the growing need for storage of privately owned gunpowder in the expanding colony of New South Wales. It has historical associations with its designers, Colonial Architects Edmund Blacket and Alexander Dawson, and despite the loss of original structural arrangement retains some ability to demonstrate its former use as a magazine facility for the storage of gunpowder. The building also has some historical significance as part of the shipbuilding establishment on Goat Island since 1925. The building is aesthetically significant mainly for the technical innovation of its design which departed from the military standard typified by the adjacent Queen&#x27;s Magazine. The Colonial Magazine is also technically significant for the surviving evidence of its construction and use, and for the archaeological evidence likely to be present beneath and around the building.

Goat Island was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Goat Island is a harbour island which demonstrates all the phases of use and development from Precontact Aboriginal occupation to the present day. Its almost continuous use since the 1820s for a variety of activities related to the operational management of Sydney Harbour by various government agencies is significant as is its value as part of the historic landscape which now forms Sydney Harbour National Park. .

It is the site after 1833 of the first major facility for the storage of ordnance and explosives in both government and private hands. It is also the site of the first permanent establishment of the Water Police in Sydney Harbour. It has associations with Royal Engineer George Barney and Colonial Architect Edmund Blackett. Goat Island was also the emergency centre for bacteriological research during the 1900 outbreak of bubonic plague. After 1901 it was the shipyard and base for port management operations by the Sydney Harbour Trust and its successor the Maritime Services Board.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

Goat Island is of considerable aesthetic significance. It is one of several prominent Sydney Harbour islands that contribute to the overall beauty and pattern of the harbour. It is visually prominent at the confluence of Port Jackson, Darling Harbour and the Parramatta River. The Queen&#x27;s magazine&#x27;s powerful architectural qualities are complemented by the unusual design of the contemporary stone cooperage, barrack buildings and perimeter walling. The use of sandstone and slate enhances the overall aesthetic qualities. The magazine&#x27;s aesthetic qualities are further enhanced by the topographical setting on the south western edge of the island and by the curved alignment of the stone security wall. The variety, extent and pattern of wharves, is unusual in such a concentration and provides a rich visual interplay between the rhythm of the piles and the rocky foreshore.

The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Goat Island is of State, regional and local significance. It is an example of the State&#x27;s response to the need to provide a safe storage facility and distribution point for both publicly (both Imperial and Colonial) and privately owned explosives. As an island isolated in Sydney Harbour, Goat Island during the Sydney Harbour Trust/ Maritime Services Board periods provided a place for accommodation, work, as a shipyard and operational depot and recreation for a variety of people for a period of over ninety years. It is of local significance for the people who lived and worked on the island and of regional significance for what it can tell us of the living conditions of the people who lived and worked on the island in the 20th century.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The research and historical archaeological potential of Goat Island are high. It has been continuously occupied since 1833. It has the ability to demonstrate the layering of use and occupation over a period of 150 years, including those earlier facilities that were adapted for later functions. Surviving physical evidence can demonstrate the life styles and working conditions of a diverse range of occupants and staff on the island, during all phases of development from Pre-European to the late 20th-century activities of the Maritime Services Board.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The architectural qualities of the early stone buildings on the island are remarkable and rare. The Queen&#x27;s Magazine with its barrel vault, massive external buttressing and carefully detailed ventilation system, is the finest and earliest large powder magazine.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The facilities on the island are representative of the maritime industrial activities that were once common around the inner harbour and the Parramatta River. The variety of cultural and landscape forms and plantings on the island are representative of the period.

<doc id="1097234" wikidata="Q7732381" url="?curid=1097234" title="The Ernie Kovacs Show">
<text>The Ernie Kovacs Show is an American comedy show hosted by comedian Ernie Kovacs, first shown in Philadelphia during the early 1950s, then nationally. The show appeared in many versions and formats, including daytime, prime-time, late-night, talk show, comedy, and as a summer replacement series.

&quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot; was one of only six TV shows broadcast on all four U.S. television networks during the Golden Age of Television, the others being &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot;, &quot;Pantomime Quiz&quot;, &quot;Down You Go&quot;, &quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot;, and &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot;.

==CBS==
From April 21, 1952, to January 15, 1954, Kovacs had a daytime show under the name Kovacs Unlimited airing Monday through Friday at 8:30 am ET on CBS Television. From December 30, 1952, to April 14, 1953, CBS aired the one-hour &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot; on Tuesday evenings at 8pm ET.

==DuMont==
From April 12, 1954, to April 7, 1955, he also had a late night television talk show on the DuMont Television Network under the title &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot;, which aired from 11:15pm to 12:15am ET. Kovacs began to refer to this show as The Ernie Kovacs Rehearsal in its final months.

Of the DuMont-WABD version, three partial episodes and one complete episode are known to survive. The DuMont series, while also a talk show, included many comedy segments. For example, one episode featured a spoof commercial for a product called &quot;Kodadent&quot;, a black toothpaste.

==Two NBC series==

From July 2 to September 10, 1956, NBC ran &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot; as a summer replacement series for &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; starring Sid Caesar. 

Kovacs also served as the regular substitute for Steve Allen on &quot;Tonight&quot; from September 1956 until Allen&#x27;s departure from the show (and its subsequent reformat as a news program) in January 1957.

==ABC-TV specials==
A series of eight monthly half-hour specials also titled &quot;The Ernie Kovacs Show&quot; aired Thursdays 10:30 to 11:00 pm ET on ABC from April 1961 to January 1962 with the exception of a two-month summer break in July and August. This latter series is often considered Kovacs&#x27; best television work. Shot on videotape using new editing and special effects techniques, it won an Emmy Award in 1961. Kovacs and co-director Joe Behar also won the Directors Guild of America award for a November 1961 installment, based on Kovacs&#x27; &quot;Eugene&quot; character.

The eighth and final ABC special, taped on December 3, 1961, aired on what was to have been Kovacs&#x27; 43rd birthday on January 23, 1962. The episode was restructured into a posthumous tribute to Kovacs, who had died ten days prior. Two of its features were encore presentations of the dawn-to-dusk urban street scene piece accompanied by Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot; and The Nairobi Trio performing to Robert Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Solfeggio,&quot; the latter&#x27;s insertion after the closing credits made possible because the sponsor Dutch Masters allowed the special to run commercial-free.

==Production notes==
The original studio location was on the 4th floor of the WPTZ-TV (now KYW-TV) studio location at 1619 Walnut Street in Philadelphia. That studio was very small and accommodated approximately 45 audience members. The basement studio of the same building is where &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; was shot from June 1965 until July 1972. This studio was converted for office use for an architectural firm in 2002.

At NBC, the show was broadcast from Studio 6-B at NBC Studios in Rockefeller Center. The studio was subsequently used for various versions of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

<doc id="1097238" wikidata="Q1456442" url="?curid=1097238" title="The Applejacks (British band)">
<text>The Applejacks were an English beat group of the 1960s. They were the first &quot;Brumbeat&quot; group (that is, from the West Midlands conurbation-Birmingham area) to reach the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, and were unusual for having a female bass guitarist, Megan Davies.

==History==
All of the Applejacks (except Jackson) were members of the same scout troop as children. Baggott, Cash and Freeman began playing together in a skiffle group named the Crestas in 1961, occasionally performing at a local youth club. Davies joined the group in 1961, Gould the following year. Lacking a vocalist, they were strictly an instrumental band until the addition of singer Al Jackson in 1963; they began playing rock and roll songs and secured a residency at Solihull Civic Hall. During that time, they changed their name to the Jaguars before finally becoming the Applejacks in July 1962.

Signed to Decca Records late in 1963, their success was largely due to the strength of their first single, &quot;Tell Me When&quot;. Written by Les Reed and Geoff Stephens, &quot;Tell Me When&quot; was released in February 1964 and shot to No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart. After the group met the Beatles during rehearsals for a television appearance, John Lennon and Paul McCartney provided the Applejacks with a song which was to be their second single: &quot;Like Dreamers Do&quot;. However, the record only reached number 20 in the UK chart, whilst their final hit, &quot;Three Little Words (I Love You)&quot; (also in 1964), made it to No. 23.

The group quarrelled with Decca over their next single. Decca wanted them to record &quot;Chim Chim Chiree&quot;, but the group disliked the song. Although the single had been announced (and is therefore listed in most discographies), it was never released. According to Megan Davies, the group did not even record &quot;Chim Chim Chiree&quot;. Thanks to that quarrel, their next single, &quot;Bye Bye Girl&quot;, was released half a year after &quot;Three Little Words&quot;.

Although Decca continued to issue Applejacks recordings during 1965 (including the first released version of Ray Davies&#x27;s &quot;I Go to Sleep&quot;), they met with little response from the public, leading to a rapid return to playing local gigs. After 1966, the group became an act on cruise liners, working for Cunard until the end of the decade and frequently aboard the , , and &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;.

Freeman and Davies were married in September 1964, with the other band members serving as groomsmen. Davies eventually retired from music to become a nurse and hospital administrator for the National Health Service.

They were once described as the &quot;Solihull Sound&quot;, and Chris May and Tim Phillips compared their music to the bijou doorbells popular in Solihull at the time.

On 11 December 2010, the band came together once more to perform a one-off concert at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Solihull, in which church the Applejacks practised in the early days. The concert was meant to raise funds for the church.

<text>William H. Stewart (May 19, 1921 – April 23, 2008) was an American pediatrician and epidemiologist. He was appointed tenth Surgeon General of the United States from 1965 to 1969.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Stewart was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He began college at the University of Minnesota and completed his undergraduate degree at Louisiana State University (LSU) (1942), after his father moved the family to Baton Rouge during World War II to chair the pediatrics department at LSU. Stewart earned his medical degree through an accelerated program at the LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, under the auspices of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Specialized Training Program.

After graduating in 1945, he received a commission as a first lieutenant, kept an inactive status during his 9-month internship at Philadelphia General Hospital, and then served as a Medical Officer at Brooke General Hospital in San Antonio, Texas (1946–1947). After a brief stint at the Minneapolis Veterans Administration hospital at Fort Snelling, Stewart returned home to Baton Rouge for a 2-year pediatrics residency at Charity Hospital (1948–1950). His plans to enter private practice were cut short by the outbreak of the Korean War and his remaining military obligation.

===Early career===
Stewart&#x27;s introduction to the Public Health Service (PHS) came when the Air Force agreed to transfer him into the first class of renowned epidemiologist Alexander Langmuir&#x27;s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) at the Communicable Disease Center (CDC). In February 1951, Stewart accepted a Commission in PHS&#x27;s Inactive Reserve as a Senior Assistant Surgeon. Four months later, he was dispatched as the sole physician epidemiologist to CDC’s Thomasville, Georgia Field Station. As an EIS Fellow he worked under Dr. James Watt (soon to be named Director of the new National Heart Institute) (NIH), studying how fly eradication dampened outbreaks of childhood diarrheal diseases and about DDT&#x27;s efficacy in combating typhus. After EIS, Stewart followed his mentor to the National Heart Institute and became a trainee at the Grants and Training Branch of the National Heart Institute (November 1953). When PHS opened a Heart Disease Control Program under its Bureau of State Services (BSS), Stewart was named chief (October 1954), returning to NIH in July 1956 to lead its Technical Services Branch.

In April 1957 then-Surgeon General LeRoy Edgar Burney recruited junior officer Stewart to join his staff. Stewart managed a number of projects related to planning, administrative reorganization, and health professions education and led the Office&#x27;s applied research unit—Public Health Methods—from July 1958 through 1961. With some form of national health insurance widely anticipated to be imminent, Stewart became an inhouse expert for PHS on issues related to health services delivery and third-party reimbursement. In November 1961 he returned to BSS to head a new Division of Community Health Services devoted to these issues, then from January 1963 through August 1965 worked closely with Medicare architect Wilbur Cohen (the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) Assistant Secretary for Legislation), as an Assistant to Dr. Boisfeuillet Jones, the Special Assistant for Health and Medical Affairs (subsequently renamed the Assistant Secretary for Health). Stewart’s nomination to be Surgeon General on September 24, 1965 came as a complete surprise. Only weeks earlier, then-Surgeon General Luther Leonidas Terry had appointed him to succeed James Watt as Director of NIH.

===Surgeon General===
Stewart found himself at the helm of PHS under pressure both to expand his agency because of Medicare and Medicaid and to cut back because of the war in Vietnam and a slowing of the phenomenal growth of NIH. His response was to weave PHS into the Johnson Administration’s creative approaches to federalism, using the highly successful Hill-Burton hospital construction program as a starting point for efforts to improve access to services through government planning. Soon after Stewart became Surgeon General, for example, PHS took on the high-profile and critical task of certifying the nation’s hospitals for compliance with Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prior to the July 1966 implementation of Medicare reimbursement for health services. Public concern that NIH research become the basis for improved care and greater access to care moved DHEW to convene the DeBakey Commission, whose 1964 Report Stewart used as the basis for PHS’s Regional Medical Program (the Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke Amendments of 1965). States relations programs, including categorical grants-in-aid to state health departments, were revamped along the lines of urban planning, as the Comprehensive Health Planning Act (also known as the Partnership For Health Act of 1966 and its 1967 Amendments) bypassed state health departments to award grants directly to local government and community not-for-profits, coordinated through state (so-called &quot;section 314a&quot;) and nongovernmental (&quot;section 314b&quot;) planning agencies.

Cycles of administrative upheaval accompanied these dramatic changes at PHS. The first of two major reorganizations reflected nearly a decade’s worth of planning, articulated in terms of operations research and functionally oriented management theory (known as program planning and budgeting). In contrast, the second was a dramatic reshuffling of the organizational deck by Acting Secretary of DHEW and Medicare program architect Wilbur Cohen. When Stewart became Surgeon General, he inherited an agency over which he, a career officer in PHS’s Commissioned Corps, exerted line authority. PHS enjoyed strong relationships with state health departments, the American Medical Association, and budgetary largesse for the National Institutes of Health. As a result of the two reorganizations, his successor would report as a senior advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, a political appointee, and would not even be appointed until well into President Nixon’s first term.

Stewart’s influence was more visible during the first reorganization than the second. Reorganization Plan No. 3, enacted April 25, 1966 and effective the following January (1967) gave explicit attention to the issues of access to services and environmental health. The CDC served as a model, with its decentralized administration, relative independence from Washington, and strong public constituencies. PHS activities were arranged into five Bureau-level units: Health Manpower (education programs); Health Services (concerning access, Medicare, and Medicaid); Disease Prevention and Environmental Control (environmental health); the National Institute of Mental Health (research and clinics); and the National Institutes of Health (basic and clinical research).

PHS’s new organizational chart was quickly outmoded. When the second reorganization took place the following spring (1968) the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs for DHEW, Dr. Philip Lee, replaced the Surgeon General as head of PHS. The five Bureaus were consolidated into three: the National Institutes of Health; a new Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA); and a new Consumer Protection and Environmental Health Service (CPEHS), which contained programs from the short-lived Bureau of Disease Prevention &amp; Environmental Control and the Food and Drug Administration, formerly an independent agency that had reported directly to the Secretary of DHEW. From the optimistic days of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the War on Poverty, and Medicare, PHS entered into an era characterized by more complicated bureaucratic maneuvering, increased public involvement, and renewed efforts to control Federal health expenditures.

=== Later career ===
Midway through President Richard Nixon’s first year in office, Stewart submitted his resignation (August 1, 1969). He returned to Louisiana State University (LSU)&#x27;s Medical Center at New Orleans, first as Chancellor (1969–74), then as a Professor of Pediatrics and head of the department (1973–77), concurrent with an appointment as Secretary of Louisiana’s State Department of Health and Human Resources (1974–77). Since that time, Stewart has served as Head of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at LSU.

==Personal life==
Stewart died at age 86 in Metairie, Louisiana of complications from kidney failure.

<text>The Cariboo is an intermontane region of British Columbia, Canada, centered on a plateau stretching from Fraser Canyon to the Cariboo Mountains. The name is a reference to the caribou that were once abundant in the region.

The Cariboo was the first region of the interior north of the lower Fraser River and its canyon to be settled by non-indigenous people, and played an important part in the early history of the colony and province. The boundaries of the Cariboo proper in its historical sense are debatable, but its original meaning was the region north of the forks of the Quesnel River and the low mountainous basins between the mouth of that river on the Fraser at the city of Quesnel and the northward end of the Cariboo Mountains, an area that is mostly in the Quesnel Highland and focused on several now-famous gold-bearing creeks near the head of the Willow River. The richest of them all, Williams Creek, is the location of Barkerville, which was both the capital of the Cariboo Gold Rush and of government officialdom for decades afterwards (it is now a museum town).

The Cariboo goldfields are underpopulated today but were once the most settled and most significant of the regions of interior British Columbia. As settlement spread southwards of this area, flanking the route of the Cariboo Road and spreading out through the rolling plateaus and benchlands of the Cariboo Plateau and lands adjoining it along the Fraser and Thompson rivers, the meaning changed to include a wider area than just the goldfields.

The grasslands of the Cariboo are home to the regionally endangered American badger (&quot;Taxidea taxus jeffersonii&quot;).

==Name==
As early as 1861, Governor Douglas used the name Cariboo to describe the area in dispatches to Britain.

<text>Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock is a 1956 American musical film starring Alan Dale and Alan Freed. Directed by Fred F. Sears, the film also features performances by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets (who were top-billed), Little Richard, The Treniers, and Dave Appell and the Applejacks.

In contrast to the title track of Haley&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, the title track of this film was specially written for it (screenwriter Robert E. Kent is credited as co-writer of the song). A Haley recording of the song is played over the opening credits, but it is Alan Dale who performs the number in the film. Indeed, while Haley and his band are the top-billed performers in the movie, the story in fact focuses on Dale&#x27;s character.

==Plot==
Arnie Haines is a rock and roll star who returns to his hometown to rest up for the summer only to find that rock and roll has been banned there by disapproving adults. Among those against him is influential newspaper columnist Arline MacLaine, though this does not stop Arnie from starting up a romance with MacLaine&#x27;s daughter Francine. At Francine&#x27;s urging, Arnie decides to perform a show to demonstrate to Arline that the adults&#x27; fears are unjustified. Meanwhile, MacLaine&#x27;s columns have led to other towns across the country canceling planned rock and roll shows. This leaves big-name acts like Bill Haley, Little Richard, The Treniers and Dave Appell available to perform in Arnie&#x27;s show.

The show goes well at first, with Arline prepared to write a new column acknowledging that the music is harmless. However, things go awry when Arnie rejects the advances of local girl Sunny Everett. In retaliation, Sunny gets drunk and gets two boys to begin a brawl. No one believes that Sunny was at fault and the resulting newspaper articles reporting that the show led to a drunken brawl among its attendees give rock and roll a worse reputation than ever.

As his final play, Arnie works with a local theater group to put on a show called &quot;The Pageant of Art and Culture&quot; to appeal to the adults. The show opens with depictions of paintings by Vermeer and Renoir, followed by a minuet dance performance, this show of high culture meeting with the strong approval of the adults in attendance. However, the show&#x27;s next number is taken directly from those adults&#x27; own days of youth: a raucous performance of the Charleston, providing a stark contrast between the entertainment in which the adults indulged when they were young and what they are now advocating for their children.

Arline gets the point and announces that she now agrees that parents have been using rock and roll as a scapegoat for their own parental failings. Sunny&#x27;s father agrees, noting that he now accepts that his daughter was at fault for the disruption at the rock and roll show. Arline offers Arnie an apology, both on the spot and in print, and the show closes with a rock and roll number, which even the adults now allow themselves to enjoy.

==Reception==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; premiered in New York City on December 12, 1956 (The film is often listed in reference books as being a 1957 release, due to its December 1956 premiere). The film was an immediate follow-up to the earlier &quot;Rock Around the ClockIMDB (Reference)&quot;, which had also starred Haley and Freed. Although Haley and the Comets were the top-billed stars of the film, their role in it was relatively minor and the film failed to duplicate the box office success of its predecessor. Today it is notable for the performances of Bill Haley and His Comets and Little Richard and the appearance of Alan Freed, all members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

# &quot;Tutti-Frutti&quot; – Little Richard

# &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; – Alan Dale

The version of the guitar instrumental &quot;Goofin&#x27; Around&quot; performed in this film differs from the version released on Decca Records; it has yet to be officially issued although a film audio recording of the scene in which it was played (as opposed to the original studio recording) was released in the late 1990s by the German label Hydra Records. Due to sheet music for the songs &quot;Applejack&quot; and &quot;Country Dance&quot; being released as a tie-in with this movie but with Bill Haley&#x27;s, not Dave Appell&#x27;s, photo on the cover, these songs, although Haley-sounding, are often erroneously cited as Bill Haley recordings.

Three Little Richard songs are featured: two performed by Richard himself, and the third is a cover version of his &quot;Rip it Up&quot; performed by Haley.

Alan Dale&#x27;s song &quot;I Cry More&quot; was one of the first songs published by the team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The two were largely unknown at the time of the film, and did not have a hit together until 1958, when their song &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; went to number one on the Billboard country chart.

As with &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, no official soundtrack album was released, though some non-American issues of Haley compilations tied in to the film. Haley&#x27;s 1956 album, &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Stage Show&quot;, includes four of the songs featured in the movie: &quot;Hot Dog Buddy Buddy&quot;, &quot;Goofin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;Hook, Line and Sinker&quot;, and &quot;Calling All Comets&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; was never released officially on VHS or laserdisc in North America. In 2006, the film was released on Region 1 DVD by Sony Pictures (current owners of the Columbia catalog) in a two-disc set with &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;.

<text>John Zacherle ( ; sometimes credited as John Zacherley; September 26, 1918 – October 27, 2016) was an American television host, radio personality, singer, and voice actor. He was best known for his long career as a television horror host, often broadcasting horror films in Philadelphia and New York City in the 1950s and 1960s. Best known for his character of &quot;Roland/Zacherley&quot;, he also did voice work for films, and recorded the top ten novelty rock and roll song &quot;Dinner with Drac&quot; in 1958. He also edited two collections of horror stories, &quot;Zacherley&#x27;s Vulture Stew&quot; and &quot;Zacherley&#x27;s Midnight Snacks&quot;.

== Biography ==
Zacherle was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

In 1954, he gained his first television role at WCAU-TV in Philadelphia, where he was hired as an actor playing several roles (one was an undertaker) in &quot;Action in the Afternoon&quot;, a Western produced by the station and aired in the New York City market. Three years later, he was hired as the host of WCAU&#x27;s &quot;Shock Theater&quot;, which debuted on October 7, 1957. it was so popular that when Zacherle asked for three human hairs to make a pillow, he received 23,000 replies.

He was a close colleague of Philadelphia broadcaster Dick Clark, and sometimes filled in for Clark on road touring shows of Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in the 1960s. Clark reportedly gave Zacherle his nickname of &quot;The Cool Ghoul&quot;. In 1958, partly with the assistance and backing of Clark, Zacherle cut &quot;Dinner with Drac&quot; for Cameo Records, backed by Dave Appell. At first, Clark thought the recording – in which Zacherle recites humorously grisly limericks to rock and roll accompaniment – was too gory to play on &quot;Bandstand&quot;, and made Zacherle return to the studio to cut a second tamer version. Eventually both versions were released simultaneously as backsides on the same 45, and the record broke the top ten nationally. Zacherle later released several LPs mixing horror sound effects with novelty songs.

===Move to New York===
The purchase of WCAU by CBS in 1958 prompted Zacherle to leave Philadelphia for WABC-TV in New York, where the station added a &quot;y&quot; to the end of his name in the credits. 
In 1963, he hosted animated cartoons, as well as &quot;Chiller Theatre&quot; on WPIX-TV.

In 1965, he hosted a teenage dance show for three years at WNJU-TV in Newark called &quot;Disc-O-Teen&quot;, hosting the show in full costume and using the teenage show participants in his skits.

In December 1968, Zacherle moved to radio as the morning host for progressive rock WNEW-FM. In the summer of 1969, he became the station night broadcaster (10 pm–2 AM); in June 1971, he switched his show to WPLJ-FM, where he stayed for ten years.

On February 14, 1970, he appeared at Fillmore East music hall in New York City to introduce the Grateful Dead; his introduction can be heard on the album &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks Volume 4&quot;.

===1980s and beyond===
In the early 1980s, he played a wizard on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, appearing without his Roland/Zacherley costume and make-up. He continued to perform in character at Halloween broadcasts in New York and Philadelphia in the 1980s and 1990s, once narrating Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot; while backed up by the Philadelphia Orchestra.

In 1983, he portrayed himself in the feature length horror comedy &quot;Geek Maggot Bingo&quot; produced and directed by Nick Zedd in sequences shot in Zacherle&#x27;s apartment on the Upper West Side.
In 1985, he hosted a special for Newark, New Jersey music video station WWHT U68 entitled &quot;The Thirteenth Hour&quot;.

In 1986, he hosted a direct-to-video program called &quot;Horrible Horror&quot;, where he performed Zacherley monologues in between clips from public domain sci-fi and horror films.

In 1988, he struck up a friendship with B-movie horror director Frank Henenlotter. He voiced the puppet &quot;Aylmer&quot;, a slug-like drug-dealing and brain-eating parasite, one of the lead characters in Henenlotter&#x27;s 1988 horror-comedy film &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, and made a cameo in his 1990 comedy &quot;Frankenhooker&quot;, appropriately playing a TV weatherman who specializes in forecasts for mad scientists.

In late 1992, Zacherle joined the staff of &quot;K-Rock&quot;, WXRK, at a time when the roster included other free-form radio DJs including Pete Fornatale, Jimmy Fink, Vin Scelsa (with whom he&#x27;d worked at WPLJ) and Meg Griffin. For the next four years he hosted a Saturday morning show called &quot;Spirit Of The Sixties&quot;. He departed in January 1996 when the station switched to an alternative rock format and hired all new jocks.

In 2010, Zacherle starred in the documentary, &quot;The Aurora Monsters: The Model Craze That Gripped the World&quot;. The film was written and produced by Dennis Vincent and Cortlandt Hull, owner of the Witch&#x27;s Dungeon Classic Movie Museum in Bristol, Connecticut. The documentary includes a number of short pieces featuring Zacherly and his puppet co-host Gorgo, of Bill Diamond Productions. The film went on to win a Rondo award.

Zacherle continued to make appearances at conventions through 2015, and his collectibles, including model kits, T-shirts, and posters, continue to sell. The book &quot;Goodnight, Whatever You Are&quot; by Richard Scrivani, chronicling Zacherle&#x27;s life, debuted at the Chiller Theatre Expo in Secaucus, New Jersey, in October 2006. Scrivani and Tom Weaver followed it up with the scrapbook-style &quot;The Z Files: Treasures from Zacherley&#x27;s Archives&quot; in 2012.

The comic book anthology, &quot;Zacherley&#x27;s Midnite Terrors&quot; (created by Joseph M. Monks, and featuring top artists like Basil Gogos, Ken Kelly, William Stout and Mike Koneful), was created solely as a tribute to &quot;Zach&quot;. Three issues were published, and Zacherley acted in a commercial to promote them.

Zacherle continued to make occasional on-air appearances, usually around Halloween, including a two-hour show at WCBS-FM with Ron Parker on October 31, 2007. (By this point, the 89-year-old was one of the very few people left in radio that was older than the medium itself.) Zacherley and Chiller Theatre returned to the WPIX airwaves on October 25, 2008, for a special showing of the 1955 Universal Pictures science fiction classic &quot;Tarantula!&quot;.

The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Zacherle into their Hall of Fame in 2010.

He died on October 27, 2016, at his home in Manhattan at the age of 98.

==Legacy==
He was the uncle of &quot;My Little Pony&quot; creator Bonnie Zacherle.

== Partial &quot;Zacherley at Large&quot; episode guide==

<text>Helen Brodie Cowan Bannerman (&#x27;Watson&quot;&#x27;; 25 February 1862 – 13 October 1946) was a Scottish children&#x27;s writer. She is best known for her first book, &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; (1899).

==Life==

Bannerman was born at 35 Royal Terrace, Edinburgh. She was the eldest daughter and fourth child of seven children of Robert Boog Watson (1823–1910), minister of the Free Church of Scotland and malacologist, and his wife Janet (1831–1912), daughter of Helen Brodie and the papermaker and philanthropist Alexander Cowan. Between the ages of 2 and 12, she lived in Madeira, where her father was minister at the Scottish church. When the family returned, they spent much time with their maternal aunt, Mrs Cowan, at 35 Royal Terrace on Calton Hill.

Because women were not admitted into Scottish universities, she sat external examinations set by the University of St. Andrews, attaining the qualification of Lady Literate in Arts (LLA) in 1887. She then married Dr William Burney Bannerman, a physician and an officer in the Indian Medical Service (IMS), in 1889. 

The couple moved to India in 1889, taking up residence in Madras (modern-day Chennai), capital of the state of Tamil Nadu on the southeastern seacoast, populated mostly by the Tamil ethnic group. During their 30 years in India, they had four children: daughters Janet (b. 1893) and Day (b. 1896), and sons James &quot;Pat&quot; Patrick (b. 1900) and Robert (b. 1902). 

Bannerman and her husband returned to Edinburgh in 1918; he died in 1924. She died at home on 13 October 1946, of cerebral thrombosis and a fractured femur; her body was cremated. She is buried with her husband in Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh.

Bannerman was the grandmother of the physicist Tom Kibble, who discovered the Higgs–Kibble mechanism and the Higgs boson.

==Works==
The illustrations and settings of Bannerman&#x27;s books are all about Indians and their culture. &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; has ghee, tigers, and a bazaar, &quot;The Story of Little Black Mingo&quot; has jungle, a mugger crocodile, a dhobi, and a mongoose, &quot;Little Black Quasha&quot; has a bazaar and tigers, and &quot;The Story of Little Black Quibba&quot; has mangoes and elephants.

<text>Robert Louis Ridarelli (April 26, 1942 – April 5, 2022), known by the stage name Bobby Rydell , was an American singer and actor who mainly performed rock and roll and traditional pop music. In the early 1960s, he was considered a teen idol. His most well-known songs include &quot;Wildwood Days&quot;, &quot;Wild One&quot; and &quot;Volare&quot; (cover of an Italian song by Domenico Modugno, &quot;Nel blu, dipinto di blu&quot;); in 1963 he appeared in the musical film &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;.

In the 1980s, he joined a trio called The Golden Boys, with fellow former teen idols Frankie Avalon and Fabian Forte. He continued to tour up until his death in 2022.

==Early life==
Rydell was born on April 26, 1942 and was the son of Jennie Ridarelli (née Sapienza) and Adrio &quot;Al&quot; Ridarelli. Both of his parents were of Italian descent. He grew up in the Lower Moyamensing neighborhood of South Philadelphia.

As a child, he mimicked the singers he saw on television, and at the age of seven his father took him around the clubs of Philadelphia, asking if he could sing and do some impersonations. By the time he was eight, his reputation led to an appearance on a talent show on the national television series,&quot;TV Teen Club.&quot; He won the contest, and the show&#x27;s presenter, Paul Whiteman, recruited him into the cast, where he remained for several years. It was here that his name was anglicised to Bobby Rydell.

==Music career==
Rydell played in several bands in the Philadelphia area. As a 14-year-old he was the drummer for the Emanons (NoName spelled backward) which included his childhood friend Pat Azzara on guitar. Azzara later assumed the stage name Pat Martino, and went on to achieve recognition as one of the preeminent jazz guitarists of all time. Another band was Rocco and the Saints, in which he sang and played drums. After releasing three unsuccessful singles for small companies, he signed a recording contract with Cameo Records. This was run by Bernie Lowe, who had been the pianist accompanying him on &quot;TV Teen Club.&quot; After a couple of flops, &quot;Kissin&#x27; Time&quot; made the charts in 1959. In May 1960, Rydell toured Australia with The Everly Brothers, Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock, Marv Johnson, The Champs, The Crickets, and Lonnie Lee.

His second success was &quot;We Got Love&quot;. The album of the same name, his first, sold a million copies and obtained gold disc status. &quot;Wild One&quot; was followed with &quot;Little Bitty Girl&quot; which was his second million-selling single. He continued releasing hit songs with &quot;Swingin&#x27; School&quot; backed by &quot;Ding-A-Ling&quot; and &quot;Volare&quot; later in 1960, which also sold over a million copies. It is estimated he sold over 25 million records in total.

In 1961, he performed at the Copacabana in New York City, where he was the youngest performer to headline at the nightclub. In February 1961, he appeared at the Festival du Rock at the Palais des Sports de Paris in Paris, France.

Rydell&#x27;s success and prospects led his father, Adrio, a foreman at the Electro-Nite Carbon Company in Philadelphia, to resign in 1961 after 22 years to become his son&#x27;s road manager.

In 1963, Rydell released the song &quot;Wildwood Days&quot;, which reached Number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and remained there for nine weeks. A mural on the Wildwood, New Jersey, boardwalk, painted in 2014, honors Rydell, whose song placed the community in the national spotlight.

That same year, Rydell portrayed Hugo Peabody in the film version of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, also starring Ann-Margret and Dick Van Dyke. The original stage production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; had no real singing role for the character of Hugo, but the movie script was rewritten specifically to expand the part for Rydell. In 2011, Sony Pictures digitally restored the film. Rydell and Ann-Margret were in attendance at the restoration premiere in Beverly Hills, hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
During the 1960s, Rydell had numerous hit records on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. His recording career earned him 34 Top 100 hits, placing him in the top five artists of his era (&quot;Billboard&quot;). They included his most popular successes: &quot;Wild One&quot; (his highest scoring single, at number 2), &quot;Volare&quot; (number 4), &quot;Swingin&#x27; School&quot; (number 5), &quot;Kissin&#x27; Time&quot; (number 11), &quot;Sway&quot; (number 14), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Bonnie&quot; (number 18), and &quot;The Cha-Cha-Cha&quot; (number 10). His last major chart success was &quot;Forget Him&quot;, which reached number 4 on the Hot 100 in January 1964. The song, written by Tony Hatch, was his fifth and final gold disc winner.

Rydell left Cameo-Parkway Records later in 1964 and signed with Capitol Records. By that point, the British Invasion had arrived and acts such as Rydell suffered a dramatic decline in popularity. Bands such as The Beatles became more popular, and Rydell unwittingly contributed to his own downfall by inspiring John Lennon and Paul McCartney to write &quot;She Loves You&quot;, a song which catapulted their success way beyond his.

During that time, he performed on many television programs, including &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, where a recurring role as Zeke Kadiddlehopper, Clem Kadiddlehopper&#x27;s younger cousin, was written for him by Skelton. He also appeared on &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;, Jack Benny, Joey Bishop, and &quot;The George Burns Show&quot;. He was a regular on &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot; and was a panelist on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in 1964. On October 6, 1964, he made a guest appearance on the episode &quot;Duel&quot; of the television series &quot;Combat!&quot;. It was Rydell&#x27;s first dramatic acting role.

In 1963, Rydell starred in an unsold television pilot called &quot;Swingin&#x27; Together&quot; produced by Desilu Productions, which featured him as the frontman for a four-piece rock &#x27;n roll band seeking their big break. Also during that time, Rydell served in the 103rd Engineer Battalion of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.

In January 1968, it was announced in the UK music magazine &quot;NME&quot; that Rydell had signed a long-term recording contract with Reprise Records. He continued to perform in nightclubs, supper clubs and Las Vegas venues throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but his career was hampered by the refusal by ABKCO Records to reissue Rydell&#x27;s Cameo-Parkway catalog, so it was completely unavailable until 2005, although he did re-record his hits in 1995 for K-tel Records). He had one more hit after 1965, a disco re-recording of &quot;Sway&quot;, which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart in 1976.

Rydell continued to tour for the remainder of his life, often with Frankie Avalon and Fabian Forte, performing under the name &quot;The Golden Boys&quot;. His autobiography was published in 2016.

==Personal life==
Rydell was married to his first wife, Camille Quattrone Ridarelli, for 35 years, from 1968 until her death in 2003. They had two children. He married Linda Hoffman in 2009. Rydell was a longtime resident of Penn Valley, Pennsylvania, and lived in the same house from 1963 to 2019 before he resided in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania until his death.

Rydell served in the U.S. National Guard, and began his service in 1964 with two months of basic training at Fort Dix.

The street on which he was born in Philadelphia was renamed Bobby Rydell Boulevard, in his honor. In 2023, it was announced that a statue of Rydell would be erected in Wildwood, New Jersey, through the Bobby Rydell Foundation organized by his family.

===Health and death===
Rydell cancelled a 2012 Australia tour because his health had deteriorated significantly and he was in need of urgent major surgery. On July 9, 2012, he underwent a double organ transplant, to replace his liver and one kidney, at Thomas Jefferson University in his hometown of Philadelphia. In January 2013, six months after the double transplant surgery, Rydell returned to the stage in Las Vegas for a three-night engagement to a sold-out audience. He continued to perform internationally and returned to tour Australia in 2014.

Rydell died from complications of pneumonia at Jefferson Abington Hospital on April 5, 2022, three weeks before his 80th birthday.

==Media==
In the Broadway musical drama &quot;Grease&quot;, its film adaptation, and the film&#x27;s sequel &quot;Grease 2&quot;, the high school was named &quot;Rydell High&quot; after Rydell.

In 2000, in the book &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; (p. 96), Paul McCartney said: 

No specific song title is given in &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, but Bob Spitz writes in &quot;The Beatles: The Biography&quot; that McCartney originally modeled &quot;She Loves You&quot; on the Rydell &quot;answering song&quot; called &quot;Swingin&#x27; School&quot;, and not &quot;Forget Him&quot;, as is commonly cited.

In the Oscar-winning film &quot;Green Book&quot; (2018), Rydell is portrayed in the opening scenes by actor Von Lewis.

<text>The Unity Theatre is a theatre in Liverpool, England.

Formed by directors Gerry Dawson and Edgar Criddle as the Merseyside Left Theatre in the 1930s, the theatre became known as the Merseyside Unity Theatre in 1944. The company was known for being radical and experimentalist, staging classics alongside contemporary left-wing theatre; an aim was to make theatre accessible to the working class.

Today, the theatre provides workshops and performance space and is based in a converted synagogue (the former home of Liverpool Reform Synagogue) on Hope Place off Hope Street.

<doc id="1097263" wikidata="Q5974922" url="?curid=1097263" title="Kal Mann">
<text>Kal Mann (born Kalman Cohen; May 6, 1917 – November 28, 2001) was an American lyricist. He is best known for penning the words to Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;, plus &quot;Butterfly&quot;, a hit for both Charlie Gracie and Andy Williams, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot;, sung by Chubby Checker, which won the 1962 Grammy Award for Best Rock &amp; Roll Recording.

==Biography==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mann began his career in entertainment as a comedy writer for Danny Thomas and Red Buttons, until his friend and songwriter, Bernie Lowe, encouraged him to try writing lyrics for the music industry. Mann co-wrote songs with Lowe and Dave Appell, yielding a number of major rock and roll hits such as Charlie Gracie&#x27;s &quot;Butterfly,&quot; which sold more than two million copies and also become a million seller for the crooner, Andy Williams, and also a minor hit for Bob Carroll, whose cover version peaked at #61. In addition he co-wrote Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Teddy Bear,&quot; Bobby Rydell&#x27;s &quot;Wild One&quot; and &quot;The Cha-Cha-Cha&quot;, and Chubby Checker&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot; and &quot;Limbo Rock.&quot; Mann wrote a number of songs for Checker, including &quot;Popeye the Hitchhiker&quot; and &quot;Slow Twistin&#x27;&quot; plus Pat Boone&#x27;s &quot;Remember You&#x27;re Mine&quot;, and the much covered &quot;You Can&#x27;t Sit Down&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Bristol Stomp&quot; for The Dovells with David Appell.

&quot;Fabulous&quot;, another Charlie Gracie track (and in 1999 covered by Paul McCartney) sold nearly one million copies upon release.

Some songs such as &quot;Limbo Rock&quot; were credited under the pseudonym of Jon Sheldon. This enabled him to be affiliated with both ASCAP and BMI.

==Record label ==
Mann and Lowe teamed up to form Cameo-Parkway Records in 1956.

==Death ==
Kal Mann died in 2001 from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, at the age of 84.

<doc id="1097267" wikidata="Q4879977" url="?curid=1097267" title="Beer day">
<text>Beer Day is the term applied to an event where a United States Navy or Military Sealift Command vessel&#x27;s personnel are issued, and authorized to consume, beer.

==Historical context==
Beginning in 1794 the U.S. Congress authorized a daily alcohol ration for sailors. Over time the regulations of alcohol consumption aboard Navy vessels changed in various forms until finally on June 1, 1914 Josephus Daniels issued General Order 99, which ended all alcohol consumption.

==Authorization==
When a vessel has been at sea for 45 continuous days and has more than 5 days left before coming into port, then a ship captain may request permission from the Numbered Fleet Commander to conduct a beer day. This authorization is not automatic and is subject to operational commitments, local threat assessments and the commander&#x27;s approval. This event is authorized once every 45 days at sea, so once a beer day is held, the ship&#x27;s crew has to wait another 45 continuous days without a port call until another beer day could be authorized.

==Intent==
The purpose of a beer day is to boost ship morale by providing the crew with an opportunity to relax and are usually coordinated with cook-outs, authorized wear of civilian clothes and other operational stand-downs commonly referred to as steel beach picnics.

<text>WTBS-LD (channel 6) is a low-power television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, which has been owned by Prism Broadcasting since 1991. The station&#x27;s transmitter is located at the American Tower Site on Chester Avenue in downtown Atlanta.

The original WTBS-LD (channel 26) was also a low-power television station in Atlanta, affiliated with Estrella TV. The station, which broadcast six subchannels, was a digital satellite of the current WTBS-LD, then known as WTBS-LP.

The digital transmitter, which signed on in early January 2011, was, with its sister station WANN-CD, located just northeast of the city on one of the two large towers on Briarcliff Road, at the same site along with CW affiliate WPCH-TV (channel 17), Univision owned-and-operated station WUVG-DT (channel 34), CBS affiliate WANF (channel 46), TBN O&amp;O WHSG-TV (channel 63), and several other stations.

The original WTBS-LD&#x27;s license was canceled by the Federal Communications Commission on March 17, 2021.

==History==
The station signed on as W56CD in Rome, Georgia; then W26BT; WANX-LP in January 2000; and WTBS-LP on October 15, 2007. The WANX call letters were formerly used by CBS affiliate WANF.

In 2014, the analog WTBS-LP reappeared under special temporary authority on TV channel 6, which can also be received on 87.75 MHz of the FM dial. All analog television channels had been scheduled to cease broadcasting in September 2015; this was suspended by the FCC in April of that year. In 2017, it was announced that July 13, 2021, would be the new analog low-power television transmission shutoff date. Analog channel 6 later broadcast an urban AC format branded as &quot;Mix 87.7&quot;, which is also heard via stereo audio on 87.75 FM. Steve Hegwood, the operator of Mix 87.7 announced it would cease using the WTBS frequency on January 31, 2019, due to financial shortfalls and an overcompetitive market for radio targeted at Atlanta&#x27;s black community. As of February 1, 2019, WTBS-LP became a Regional Mexican station called &quot;La Invasora&quot;.

WTBS-LP was licensed for digital operation on July 14, 2021, and changed its call sign to WTBS-LD. On July 16, the station received special temporary authority from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide an ancillary audio signal at 87.7 FM .On July 20, 2023, an FCC &quot;Report and Order&quot; included this station as one of 13 &quot;FM6&quot; stations allowed to continue to operate an FM radio broadcast, as a &quot;ancillary or supplementary&quot; service.

Sometime between 2020 and 2022, La Invasora 87.7 became La Que Buena 87.7 and retained Its Regional Mexican format.

On January 13, 2025, La Que Buena 87.7 became 87.7 The Vibe and changed their format to urban adult contemporary.

<text>Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Medress (November 19, 1938 – June 18, 2007) was an American singer and record producer, best known for his taking part in the American band The Tokens.

==Biography==
Medress was born in Brooklyn, New York City, where he attended &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; High School. In 1955 he joined a doo-wop group called the Linc-Tones, from the surname of that President of the United States, which also included at first Neil Sedaka. After Sedaka&#x27;s departure, the group reformed with additional singers as The Tokens in 1958, after several changes of name. The Tokens achieved a #1 chart success in 1961 with their arrangement of &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;, a remake of the 1939 song &quot;Mbube&quot; by South African singer Solomon Linda. Medress and the Tokens also produced hits for The Chiffons, such as &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;.

After leaving the Tokens, Medress co-produced (with Dave Appell) many of Tony Orlando and Dawn&#x27;s hits as well as Melissa Manchester&#x27;s LP. Later, he worked with Frankie Valli, David Johansen, Rick Springfield, Dan Hill, and Richard Simmons. He was also president of EMI Music Publishing Canada from 1990 to 1992. Medress produced the Dan Hill song, &quot;Never Thought (That I Could Love)&quot; in 1987, which was a #43 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and a #2 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart.

After returning to New York, Medress became a partner in Bottom Line Records, which released recordings of performances at The Bottom Line club in Greenwich Village, as well as new work by emerging artists. In recent years, Medress had worked as a consultant for SoundExchange, an agency that collects royalties from digital broadcasters, like satellite and Internet radio.

==Death==
Medress died of lung cancer at his Manhattan home on June 18, 2007, aged 68.

<doc id="1097282" wikidata="Q15044402" url="?curid=1097282" title="Trocadero (band)">
<text>Trocadero is an experimental rock band formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1997. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of Nico Audy-Rowland, Brandon Erdos, Violet Heart, and Martha Marin. Trocadero got its name after a subway stop in Paris. The band is best known for their contribution to the soundtrack of the web-series &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;. Nico Audy-Rowland had discovered the show in 2003 and sent the creators a song, &quot;Blood Gulch Blues&quot;, which would end up becoming the show&#x27;s opening theme. 

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue&quot;, was released on 01 September 2004. Their latest album, the soundtrack to Season 17 of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, was released in 2019. Nico Audy-Rowland was also involved in the Uggos, a collaboration with Jeff Williams that created the music for &quot;The Strangerhood&quot;, another Rooster Teeth series.

==History==

===1997–2002: Formation and early years===

Trocadero was initially founded by Nico Audy-Rowland, Brandon Erdos, and Susan Hsia in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Nico Audy-Rowland initially sought out bandmates by posting several flyers around Boston in July 1997. Wendy Mittelstadt was the first to respond, but could not join the band until she graduated from college. Later that year, Audy-Rowland was joined by Brandon Erdos, who had played with him in a quintet in college, and Susan Hsia.

The band played its first show on November 3, 1997, at T.T. the Bear&#x27;s Place in Cambridge, and continued to play in other clubs in the area. Hsia eventually left the band to continue her education; meanwhile, Wendy Mittelstadt, who had completed her degree, moved to Boston and joined.

===2003–08: &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; and &quot;Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue&quot;===
Nico Audy-Rowland first encountered the Rooster Teeth series &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; in 2003 after being introduced to it by a friend. Finding that he enjoyed the series, he reached out to the creators and sent them a short piece of music he had recorded, which ended up being used as its opening theme.

Trocadero&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue&quot;, was released on 01 Sep 2004. The album contains &quot;songs from and inspired by &quot;Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles&quot;&quot;, including its theme song, &quot;Blood Gulch Blues&quot;. Shortly after the release of the album, Mittelstadt left the band to join another Boston-based group.

In 2007, the band was joined by Martha Marin on slide guitar and vocals, and Jeff Williams on keyboard. Trocadero continued to perform at a number of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;-related events. Williams would later leave the band to compose his own music, including the soundtracks for seasons 8 through 10 of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;.

===2009–12: &quot;Ghosts That Linger&quot; and &quot;Flying By Wire&quot;===
Trocadero completed and released its second album, titled &quot;Ghosts That Linger&quot;, on November 21, 2009. Included on the album was the song &quot;Alien Champion&quot;, which was featured during the end credits of the DVD, as well as other Red vs. Blue music, such as &quot;First Wave&quot; and &quot;Colors.&quot;

Recording and mastering for the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Flying by Wire&quot; was completed on June 20, 2012, and the album was released at RTX on July 7, 2012.

===2014–present: &quot;When We&#x27;re Together&quot; and 15th anniversary===

Trocadero released a live album from its performance at RTX 2012 titled &quot;When We&#x27;re Together&quot; on January 27, 2014. The release celebrated the band&#x27;s 15th anniversary as well as a decade of collaboration with Rooster Teeth. In addition to an audio-only digital media release, the album was released as a CD/DVD package, which included the entire concert setlist in both audio and video form as well as four bonus studio tracks. In addition, the DVD included additional live footage from the band&#x27;s first show and other concerts, interviews by Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum, and a ten-minute &quot;Story of Trocadero&quot; video narrated by Rooster Teeth&#x27;s Miles Luna.

<doc id="1097289" wikidata="Q6186592" url="?curid=1097289" title="Jesse Leonard Steinfeld">
<text>Jesse Leonard Steinfeld (January 6, 1927 – August 5, 2014) was an American physician and public health official. He was appointed the eleventh surgeon general of the United States from 1969 to 1973.

==Early life and education==
Steinfeld was born in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, suburb of West Aliquippa. He was the son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary. His father was a smoker and died when Steinfeld was 5 years of age. His mother ran a dry goods and hardware store. He received his B.S. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1945 and his M.D. degree from Western Reserve University (now called Case Western Reserve University) in 1949. Steinfeld then completed an internship at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles and residencies at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Long Beach, California, and at the University of California, San Francisco in the Laboratory of Experimental Oncology.

==Early career==
Steinfeld became instructor in medicine at the University of California, San Francisco in 1952. From 1954 to 1958, he served as director of the radioisotope laboratory of the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and simultaneously held an appointment as instructor in medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine. In 1959, he joined the faculty of the University of Southern California School of Medicine as assistant professor of medicine, rising through the ranks to associate professor in 1963 and professor in 1967. His research interests focused on cancer.

In 1968, Steinfeld returned to the National Cancer Institute as associate director for programs. The following year, he was made deputy director of the institute.

== Surgeon general ==
He was appointed deputy assistant secretary for health and scientific affairs, and surgeon general beginning December 18, 1969.

A reorganization of the Public Health Service in 1968 had transferred its leadership to the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, so Steinfeld no longer had the line management authority of surgeons general in the pre-1968 period. During his tenure, there was an effort to do away with the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and a 1971 report made such a recommendation. The report also called the position of surgeon general &quot;an organizational anomaly,&quot; thus calling into question the need for such a position. Steinfeld spoke on behalf of the internal opposition to the report, and thanks to strong support for the corps and the surgeon general on the part of certain members of the United States Congress, the recommendations of the report were not implemented.

During Steinfeld&#x27;s tenure as surgeon general, two important new Public Health Service programs were established, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the National Health Service Corps. As a specialist in the field of cancer, Steinfeld also no doubt welcomed the passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971, which enhanced the ability of the Public Health Service to combat this deadly disease.

== Later career ==
At the beginning of the second Richard Nixon administration, Steinfeld resigned as surgeon general effective 30 January 1973. He then served as director of the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and as professor of medicine at the Mayo Medical School (1973–1974). Following that, Steinfeld was professor of medicine at the University of California, Irvine and chief of medicine at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Long Beach, California, from 1974 to 1976. He then served as dean and professor of medicine at the School of Medicine of the Medical College of Virginia from 1976 to 1983. Steinfeld became president of the Medical College of Georgia in 1983, a position that he held until his retirement in 1987.

==Death==
Steinfeld died on August 5, 2014, from complications from a stroke in Pomona, California, aged 87.

<doc id="1097294" wikidata="Q3321112" url="?curid=1097294" title="Mr. Popo">
<text> is a fictional character from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Within the series, he is a genie who serves as the assistant to Earth&#x27;s guardian deity and the caretaker of their residence, which is located high above the sky. He first appears in the one hundred sixty-third chapter of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga, published in 1988. In the Japanese anime adaptations, his voice actor was Toku Nishio, before Kawazu Yasuhiko took over the role for &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot;. For English language media, he was voiced by Christopher Cason in 1999 and from 2010 on. The character was also voiced by Chris Sabat from 2000 up until 2005.

Mr. Popo&#x27;s design and humanoid appearance has been criticized as an offensive racist stereotype by some commentators, such as children&#x27;s book author and activist Carole Boston Weatherford. As a result of the controversy, Mr. Popo&#x27;s appearance had been modified in some media depictions of the character: his lips are downsized digitally in the American release of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga by Viz Media, and his skin is recoloured blue from his original black colour in the CW4Kids TV broadcast of &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot;.

== Development ==
Mr. Popo was initially envisioned by series creator Akira Toriyama as a reptilian humanoid with a chicken-like beak that had several variant designs, including one sketch with curly hair, though all of which were ultimately discarded. Later concept art by Toriyama depict him as a slender man dressed in a manner reminiscent of Namu, an Indian yogi-inspired character who fights series protagonist Goku in a martial arts tournament early in the series. Toriyama ultimately settled on the current design, a portly humanoid with bright facial expressions whose clothing resembles Jinns, supernatural beings from Arabian mythology and Islamic theology. The early concept art sketches of Mr. Popo are included in the &quot;30th Anniversary Dragon Ball Super History Book&quot; published in 2016.

According to Toriyama, Mr. Popo has served as an assistant to successive generations of gods who preside over Earth in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; universe, suggesting that he existed long before the &quot;Nameless Namekian&quot; arrived on Earth and subsequently serve as the world&#x27;s guardian deity. Besides being a skilled practitioner of martial arts, Toriyama noted that Mr. Popo is also responsible for crafting the physical appearance of the wish-granting dragon Shenron, originally created by the Namekian Kami&quot; and summoned from Earth&#x27;s seven Dragon Balls, as it is derived from a figurine modeled by Mr. Popo.

The North American English releases of the manga series by Viz Media, which saw its first publication in March 2003, reduced the size of Mr. Popo&#x27;s lips by shading them in completely. In 2009, the CW4Kids airing of &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot; recoloured Mr. Popo&#x27;s black skin to be blue and his lips orange-yellow in hue.

=== Voice acting ===
Mr. Popo is voiced by Toku Nishio in the original series, Yasuhiko Kawazu in &quot;Kai&quot;, and Kimiko Saitō in Dragon Ball Daima. Prior to Kawazu, Dai Matsumoto voiced him in &quot;Budokai 3&quot; and &quot;Budokai Tenkaichi&quot;. In English, he was voiced by Alvin Sanders in the Ocean dub, and by Chris Cason and Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dubs. Cason&#x27;s lines as Popo in the original airings of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; were dubbed over by Sabat by the time the remastered DVDs were released, only for Cason to take over again as Mr. Popo in &quot;Kai&quot;. Other English voice actors include Doug Rand, who voiced Mr. Popo in the AB Groupe dub of the sixth &quot;DBZ&quot; film; Apollo Abraham, who was heard in the obscure Philippine dub of said film by Creative Products Corp.; and David Alan Pettitt, who lent his voice in the Blue Water dubs of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;. Sabat in particular is fond of the character, and was hopeful that the character would eventually be added into the roster of the popular fighting game &quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot; as part of future downloadable content.

== Appearances ==
A supporting character who has few overall appearances within the series, Mr. Popo&#x27;s duties consist of looking after Kami, tending to his residence, and reconstructing Shenron if the dragon&#x27;s physical form is destroyed. He also tends to an ancient butterfly garden that he cultivated thousands of years prior to the events of the series. In &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, Popo is far stronger than Son Goku when he first arrives at Kami&#x27;s Palace. He trains Goku for three years until the boy learns everything he knows. Some of the techniques Goku developed under the tutelage of Mr. Popo include the Chou Kamehameha, a more lethal version of his signature attack. In &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, he helps Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan by divulging the location of Kami&#x27;s old starship to facilitate their journey to Planet Namek. He then serves Dende as his attendant upon the latter&#x27;s ascension as Earth&#x27;s new guardian deity later in the narrative.

Mr. Popo has demonstrated the ability to magically create objects from seemingly out of thin air, for example a flying carpet which he uses as transportation in the anime story arc Garlic Junior Saga, though the character is also depicted as capable of flight or levitation using ki. Unlike series protagonist Goku, Mr. Popo can teleport instantly to a desired location without requiring the use of an energy signature to home in on. In the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime, Mr. Popo has a brief match with Son Goten and Trunks who have transformed into Super Saiyan form where he holds his own, blocking or dodging several hits and even appearing unfazed after being struck by a kick.

==Controversy and reception ==
The &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media franchise, particularly the anime adaptation of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, has long been popular with black communities around the world, as well as hip hop culture and art movement. For many African Americans who grew up watching &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime, the design of Mr. Popo is regarded as an example of highly offensive black stereotypes.

Mr. Popo&#x27;s appearance, abilities, and name share many similarities with the Buddhist/Hindu Dharmapala deity, Mahakala. These similarities include:

* Black skin with bright red lips
* Jovial, rotund appearance specific to Japan
* Dominion over time
* The Tibetan name: ནག་པོ་ཆེན་པོ།, THL: &quot;nak po chen po&quot;, (emphasis added) meaning &quot;Great Black One&quot;
* Acting as a keeper of wisdom

Notably, however, Toriyama grew up at the height of the Dakkochan craze, and, at the time of the character&#x27;s debut in 1988, Japanese popular culture was still inundated with portrayals of blackface, a controversial form of makeup historically associated with stage and film caricatures of African Americans, or a representation of the antiquated racial term sambo.

While Western commentators have often omitted the Buddhist/Hindu influence on the character, by the early 2000s, some began referring to Mr. Popo as a derogatory stereotype in the style of blackface. In her article written for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; in May 2000, Weatherford alleged that Mr. Popo represents a depiction of individuals with African heritage from a white supremacist perspective, and that characters like him are known to a far-reaching audience of children through cartoons and product tie-ins. She suggested that such stereotypical characters could adversely affect the malleable self-image of black children, and noted to her bemusement that &quot;racist stereotypes that would shock Americans don&#x27;t raise an eyebrow in much of Asia&quot;. In 2001, the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University declared that Mr. Popo is an example of a racist caricature in modern fiction. The Jim Crow Museum later published on their official website a letter written in response to their article from a reader who disagreed with their assertion that characters like Mr. Popo are deliberately anti-black in design.

In a retrospective discussion about the character, Ramsey Isler from IGN suggested that it is easy to label Mr. Popo as a racist caricature if the character is described simply as &quot;the black-skinned, red-lipped, turban-wearing servant of Kami&quot;. On one hand, he questioned the likelihood of whether Toriyama intentionally made a racist joke through Mr. Popo, acknowledging an argument from some quarters that Mr. Popo&#x27;s appearance may have been &quot;a little artistic license for an imaginary character&quot;, on the basis that &quot;Japanese animation has a history of exaggerating non-Japanese characters because the Japanese population is not very diverse&quot; and that Japanese society &quot;does not have the kinds of racial sensitivities that the Western world has&quot;. On the other hand, he also raised questions as to whether a controversial topic which is not intended to be offensive make it any less so, as well as whether explanations like &quot;it&#x27;s only a joke&quot; or &quot;they don&#x27;t know any better&quot; absolve wrongful conduct. Jack Gardner from &quot;Screen Rant&quot; assessed Mr. Popo as a relic of blackface portrayal which persisted in the manga and animation industries of Japan and the wider Asian world, long after it became a taboo subject in North America following the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement. While Gardner acknowledged the subsequent and substantial changes to the highly divisive character, he found it shocking that Mr. Popo would even appear unaltered in an internationally popular syndicated television show in the 1990s.

Regarding the alteration of Mr. Popo&#x27;s skin colour in some media depictions, Jemima Sebastian from IGN noted that the change was made for reasons that could never be fully explained, but that many fans would connect it to perceptions of racism. Cecilia D&#x27;Anastasio from &quot;Kotaku&quot; observed that while there is awareness that the character was not intended to be African-American or inspired by any people with African descents or origins, Mr. Popo&#x27;s appearance still evokes the image of a &quot;dark-skinned slave with puffy red lips&quot; and the decision to recolour him for American television is indicative of his potentially offensive reception.

<doc id="1097299" wikidata="Q7644991" url="?curid=1097299" title="Supreme Court of Puerto Rico">
<text>The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico () is the highest court of Puerto Rico, having judicial authority to interpret and decide questions of Puerto Rican law. The Court is analogous to one of the state supreme courts of the states of the United States and is the highest state court and the court of last resort in Puerto Rico. Article V of the Constitution of Puerto Rico vests the judicial power in the Supreme Court, which by nature forms the judicial branch of the government of Puerto Rico. The seat of the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court Building in San Juan Islet in the capital municipality of San Juan. 

== Structure and powers ==

The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico was established by the Foraker Act in 1900 and maintained in the 1952 Constitution of Puerto Rico. It is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. However, since Puerto Rico is under United States sovereignty, there is also a Federal District Court for the archipelago and island. 

The justices (currently eight, with one vacancy) are appointed by the Governor of Puerto Rico and confirmed by majority vote by the Senate. One of the justices serves as Chief Justice; the remaining members are designated Associate Justices. Unlike the Supreme Court of the United States, the justices of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court do not serve for life, as the Puerto Rico Constitution requires that all judges must retire upon reaching age 70. 

Although the Constitution of Puerto Rico provides for the Court to be composed of five justices, it also contains a provision that the number may be altered, though only by petition of the Court itself. This provision has been used four times in Court history. Immediately after the Constitution&#x27;s ratification, the Court asked for two additional judges. During the early 1960s, the Court once again petitioned for the addition of two more judges, arguing that there was a case backlog on its docket. Subsequently, during the 1970s the Court asked for its number to be reduced back to seven members, arguing that the backlog had been attended to. Finally, in 2010 a 4–3 majority of the justices petitioned the Legislative Assembly to once again increase the Court&#x27;s membership to nine. This decision has generated controversy since it is the first time that such a request has been done without unanimity from the justices.

The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is defined by the Constitution and the laws of Puerto Rico. In general, the jurisdictional structure parallels that of the state Supreme Courts in the continental United States. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts to interpret federal laws, unless the Supremacy Clause requires otherwise. Judgments that stand on federal law grounds may be reviewed by the United States Supreme Court, unless an adequate and independent ground for the decision based in Puerto Rico commonwealth law is also present. The Court has the power of judicial review and its decision are considered binding precedent within the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico also regulates the practice of law in Puerto Rico.

The term of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court begins on the first Monday of October and ends in the last week of June of the following year. However, during the recess months of July through September, an alternating panel of three justices are allowed to hear cases and their decisions are considered binding precedent. However, in order for any law passed by the Legislative Assembly to be declared unconstitutional, it requires the votes of a majority of the total membership of the Court, therefore, a three-justice panel may not hear constitutional challenges to laws passed by the Legislature.

The justices decide whether or not to hear oral arguments for the case. If the case is controversial or carries high public interest, an oral argument may be scheduled, although oral arguments were rare under Chief Justice Hernández Denton. When oral argument occurs, each side has twenty-five minutes to state its respective claims and five minutes for rebuttal. After the sides have ended their argument, each justice has ten minutes (in order of seniority) to ask questions to each side. Justices may decide to yield the balance of their time to one of their colleagues.

Because several Federal judges have voluntarily withdrawn from the Puerto Rico Bar Association and was converted by statute into a voluntary membership organization, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico maintains the official bar records of Puerto Rico licensed attorneys.

===Chief Justices===

The Chief Justice is the presiding officer of the Supreme Court, and amongst its functions it directs the administration of the different courts, chairs the Constitutional Redistricting Board which revises Puerto Rico&#x27;s senatorial and representative districts after every decennial census, and presides at the impeachment trial of the Governor of Puerto Rico.

===Associate Justices===


===Lower courts===

During much of the 20th century, the court system in Puerto Rico had consisted of Municipal Courts, District Courts, and the Supreme Court. Cases could be appealed from Municipal Courts to commonwealth District Courts. From the commonwealth District Courts cases were then appealed to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Supreme Court. Municipal and District courts have existed in Puerto Rico since at least the 19th century. When the United States invaded the island, it set to reorganize the judicial system. The U.S. military regime in Puerto Rico promulgated Order 118 of 1899, by which the system of Criminal Courts and Courts of First Instance and Investigation were replaced by five district courts in San Juan, Ponce, Mayaguez, Arecibo and Humacao.

Appointments to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico have traditionally been a politicized and often controversial process. The Governor of Puerto Rico usually appoints someone who is affiliated with his own political party. For example, during his sixteen years as Governor, Luis Muñoz Marín appointed only one statehooder, Rafael Hernández Matos to the court, despite the fact that statehooders represented the largest political minority in Puerto Rico. During the four years of divided partisan control of government between 2005 and 2009, when the governorship was occupied by commonwealther Aníbal Acevedo Vilá and the Senate presidency was held by statehooder Kenneth McClintock, despite the 2005 retirement of Associate Justice Baltasar Corrada del Rio, the death of Associate Justice Jaime Fuster in 2007 and the 2008 retirement of Associate Justice Francisco Rebollo, no appointments were made. For over half a century, the Court has been dominated by justices affiliated with the Popular Democratic Party, until February 2009 when, due to the accumulation of unfilled vacancies, pro-statehood Governor Luis Fortuño was able to fill three vacancies. Added to one Justice already on the Court, appointed by another pro-statehood Governor, the justices appointed by statehooders became a majority in the Court. Four women have been appointed justices since 1952; one of them, Miriam Naveira, was Chief Justice for a period of one year. Only one Afro–Puerto Rican, Justice Erick Kolthoff, has served in the Court. He is also the Court&#x27;s only Protestant.

Liana Fiol Matta, appointed by Gov. Alejandro García Padilla, was the second woman to hold the post of Chief Justice, succeeding Federico Hernández Denton, who was appointed in 2004 by Governor Sila Calderón. Previously, he had served as an Associate Justice from 1985 to 2004. In such capacity, Chief Justice Hernández Denton swore in Governors Aníbal Acevedo Vilá and Luis Fortuño. The Chief Justice is also the administrator of the Judicial Branch of Puerto Rico. 

Then Associate Justice Oronoz was confirmed in 2016 becoming the first lesbian and third woman to perside the court. This also marked the point in which four female justices constituted the largest number of women in history to serve on the court simultaneously.

==Current composition==

==Controversies==
The realignment on the court has led to several significant court decisions. In &quot;Suarez Caceres vs CEE&quot;, the court overruled a previous court decision that required that a &quot;None of the Above&quot; option be included in political status plebiscites. That option obtained an absolute majority of votes in the 1998 political status plebiscite.

A 4–3 majority amended Rule 5 of the court&#x27;s regulations to enable the most senior judge on the majority side of every case to determine the member of the Court that would write the majority opinion, which is the practice in the Supreme Court of the United States. Previously, the Chief Justice, even when on the minority side of a case, assigned the writing of the opinion of the Court.

===Conflicts with the US Federal Court===
From 1915 to 1961, decisions of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court could be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In earlier years, the First Circuit frequently reversed the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, sometimes attempting to impose its own interpretations of Puerto Rico&#x27;s civil law legal norms despite the Boston-based court&#x27;s unfamiliarity with Puerto Rico jurisprudence, until a series of opinions by United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes instructed that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretations were not to be overturned by the federal appeals court unless they were &quot;manifestly wrong.&quot;

With the standard of review so limited, and especially after Puerto Rico attained Commonwealth status under the 1952 Constitution, the route for appeals was deemed anachronistic and was repealed in 1961 providing Puerto Rico with a judicial state-federal court structure equal to that of States.

Today, decisions of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court are as final as those of any state supreme court and are reviewable by the Supreme Court of the United States only pursuant to a writ of certiorari, when an important question of federal law is involved.

Conflicts between the Puerto Rico courts and the federal court do arise from time to time. According to the 1952 Constitution of Puerto Rico, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is only for laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. However, on several occasions the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico has taken jurisdiction on cases having to do with Puerto Rican law.

In 2016, the US Supreme Court decided in the case of &quot;Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle&quot; that on the point of double jeopardy, Puerto Rico was not sovereign; thus it could not charge someone with crimes that the person had already been tried for by the United States.

===2004 general election===
A highly controversial instance occurred in November 2004, when the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico declared that all ballots should be counted during the Puerto Rican general election, 2004. The New Progressive Party brought the matter to the Federal Court and claimed that some of the ballots were applied. Federal Judge Daniel R. Domínguez took jurisdiction of the case, in a ruling that would effectively have nullified the decision of the Supreme Court. However, on December 15, 2004, the First Circuit Court reversed Domínguez&#x27;s decision and found that questions on the electoral process of Puerto Rico are matters reserved for the Puerto Rico local court system, headed by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.

<doc id="1097303" wikidata="Q7750693" url="?curid=1097303" title="The Matys Brothers">
<text>The Matys Brothers were an American lounge act made up of four singing comedians. They were born and raised in Chester, in the Philadelphia area . The quartet&#x27;s first record, &quot;Muskrat Ramble,&quot; released on the Essex Records label, was a big hit in 1954, and by 1956 the group was part of Bill Haley&#x27;s talent and booking stable and recording for Decca Records. The members of the band were Emil on saxophone, John on bass and violin, Gene on drums, and Walt on accordion. 
==History==
On August 28, 1957, the Matys Brothers appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; performing &quot;Muskrat Ramble&quot; and &quot;Crazy Street&quot;. &quot;Muskrat Ramble&quot; was a 1954 chart entry in Cashbox and Variety.

In 1958, the Matys Brothers made two records for Haley&#x27;s Clymax record label, one of which, &quot;Crazy Street,&quot; co written by Haley, later was considered a rockabilly classic. On this song and the three others recorded for Clymax, the Matys Brothers were backed by members of Bill Haley&#x27;s band, The Comets (several of their recordings were also written by members of Haley&#x27;s group). Later, the Matys Brothers grew to rely on their own instrumentation (Walt: the accordion, John: the bass and fiddle, Emil: the sax, and Gene: the drums). Gene and Emil could play any instrument (you put in their hands) and began recording polka music for the Sunnyside and Select labels during the late 1950s and early 1960s. &quot;Rummy Polka&quot; was a hit for them in 1959, and the Matys Brothers scored their biggest hit in 1963, &quot;Who Stole the Keeshka?&quot;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the brothers, John, Walt, Emil and Gene, toured the west coast. They appeared in the 1960s at The Showboat in Las Vegas, The Holiday Hotel downtown Reno, Nevada, and The Commercial Hotel in Elko, Nevada. 

Some of the brothers struggled, at times, to maintain normal family life due to the late hours and the demanding travel, that was a part of their profession. Emil has a daughter, Terri, who was born during his first marriage to Mertis. After a divorce, he then married the band&#x27;s singer Maria Carmen and they have one son, Marc. Gene had two children with his first wife, Wanda, they were Tom and Diane, that ended in divorce. He then married Pearl and had two sons, including Gene Jr. After his second marriage, Gene married Donna and had two children Ross and Tanna. Emil lived in Elko, Nevada and died on May 5, 2008; Gene died 12 October 1993 in Elko.

Emil was not only remembered for his years of entertaining with the Matys Brothers, but also for the time and efforts he spent voluntarily while working with high school musicians, during the last several years of his life in Elko.

<doc id="1097304" wikidata="Q4749872" url="?curid=1097304" title="An Early Frost">
<text>An Early Frost is a 1985 American made-for-television drama film. It was the first major film with major motion picture stars, Aidan Quinn, Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara, and Sylvia Sidney, broadcast on a major television network, NBC, to deal with the topic of AIDS. It was viewed by 34 million households in its initial airing, the highest rated show of the night, even beating Monday Night Football. It received 14 Emmy nominations, winning 3 including Best Original Teleplay, a Peabody Award, as well as multiple Golden Globe nominations, including one for Sylvia Sidney who won for Best Supporting Actress. It was a major breakthrough into mass culture, as it was the first time an American audience of that size saw a film about a gay man who had AIDS, which up until then was considered a gay disease.

It was first broadcast on the NBC television network on November 11, 1985. It was directed by John Erman, from the Emmy Award-winning teleplay written by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman (story by Sherman Yellen). Aidan Quinn stars as Michael Pierson, a Chicago attorney who goes home to break the news that he is gay and has AIDS to his parents, played by Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands.

==Plot==

Michael Pierson, a successful lawyer, suffers a bad coughing jag at work and is rushed to the hospital. There he learns from a doctor that he has been exposed to HIV. At home, he receives another piece of disturbing news: his lover, Peter (D. W. Moffett), confesses that he had sex outside the relationship because Michael is a workaholic and is living in the closet. Michael, in a rage, throws Peter out of the house. He then travels to his parents&#x27; home to inform them that he is gay and has AIDS.

Michael&#x27;s father, Nick (Ben Gazzara), is a lumber company owner, and his wife, Kate (Gena Rowlands), is a former concert pianist, housewife, and grandmother. The couple&#x27;s daughter, Susan (Sydney Walsh) is married and has a child. Nick reacts angrily to the news, while Kate attempts to adapt to the situation. Nick initially refuses to speak to Michael for a day before breaking silence by saying, &quot;I never thought the day would come when you&#x27;d be in front of me and I wouldn&#x27;t know who you are.&quot; Susan, who is pregnant, refuses to see Michael, saying that she &quot;can&#x27;t take that chance,&quot; and Nick explodes when Michael tries to kiss Kate. Kate remembers reading in a magazine article that HIV is not transmitted through casual contact and tries to get the rest of the family to accept Michael (Gena Rowlands also taped a public service announcement about HIV transmission). Michael eventually winds up in the hospital (after paramedics who are called to his parents&#x27; house refuse to transport him to the hospital) and meets a fellow patient named Victor (John Glover), a flamboyant homosexual with AIDS. The film depicts Victor&#x27;s death and shows a nurse throwing Victor&#x27;s few possessions into a garbage bag because she fears that the items could be contaminated.

Afterwards, Michael returns home and discovers Peter came to visit, and the two quickly reconcile. Peter asks Michael to go back home with him, but Michael insists that he cannot. As he continues to struggle coping with his diagnosis, Michael attempts suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, but is stopped by Nick. The two argue and Nick insists that Michael keep fighting. The film ends with Michael taking a taxi cab back to Chicago, telling his parents he loves them before he goes.

==Development==

The teleplay for the film by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman spent two years in development and underwent at least thirteen rewrites before the Standards and Practices division at the network accepted it for airing.

==Reviews, awards, and aftermath==
Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called &quot;An Early Frost&quot; &quot;the most important TV movie of the year.&quot;

The film was number one in the Nielsen ratings during the night it aired, garnering a 23.3 share and watched by 34 million people (the film outperformed a San Francisco 49ers-Denver Broncos game broadcast on ABC and a &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; episode on CBS). The film was nominated for 14 Emmy Awards and won three, including Outstanding Writing For a Movie or Miniseries for Cowen and Lipman for their teleplay. Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara, Aidan Quinn, Sylvia Sidney and John Glover were all nominated for their performances, as was John Erman for his direction. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television movie and won Sylvia Sidney the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or a TV Movie. It also won the Peabody Award. The network, however, lost $500,000 in revenue because advertisers were leery about sponsoring the film. The film conveyed the prejudices surrounding HIV/AIDS at the time and the then common limited understanding by the general public of the methods of transmission and likelihood of infection.

<doc id="1097311" wikidata="Q444451" url="?curid=1097311" title="City of Golden Shadow">
<text>City of Golden Shadow, originally published as Otherland, is a science fiction novel by American writer Tad Williams, the first book in his Otherland series. The &quot;Otherland&quot; refers to a virtual world or worlds and the &quot;City Of Golden Shadow&quot; is a city in the Otherland network to which the main characters are being summoned.
The novel tells the story of a frightening virtual network created by a group of rich men known as The Grail Brotherhood. These men include: Felix Jongleur, who was a child at the time of the First World War and is currently the world&#x27;s oldest man; Jiun Biao, a Chinese economist described as &quot;the terror of Asia&quot;; and Robert Wells, the owner of Telemorphix, the world&#x27;s largest telecommunications company. The book tells the story of a group of ordinary people who are drawn into the network to stop them.

==Plot summary==
The first character introduced is a man called Paul Jonas, apparently an infantryman on the Western Front of the First World War. In what he at first believes to be a dream or hallucination, he meets a woman with wings, who gives him a feather. He wakes from the experience to find himself back in the trenches, but realizes the experience was not a dream when he discovers the feather. Two of his comrades, Finch and Mullet, begin to express doubts about his sanity. Eventually, Paul runs off into no-man&#x27;s land. There, he finds the bird-woman but Finch and Mullet have pursued him, and they have been transformed into monstrous shapes: Mullet is grossly fat and Finch has no eyes. Paul flees in terror and falls through a hole in space. He discovers himself in a place similar to the chess-land in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, where he is caught in the battle between the red and the white, as well as hunted by Finch and Mullet. He escapes with a young boy he met at an inn, whose name is Gally. They find themselves on Mars, which is inhabited by creatures who demand a sacrifice of a princess from the planet Venus each year. He recognizes the chosen woman as the winged woman he met earlier, but he cannot remember when he met her. His memory does not even extend to his time in the chess-land. With the help of other men from Earth, he rescues the princess, then flees from the angry Martians. He sees Mullet and Finch again, however, and tries to escape in a hijacked airship. He loses control of the airship and finds himself in a conservatory with a harp, which shrinks to the size of his palm. Mullet and Finch confront him, demanding that he give them the harp, but he refuses and appears again on the airship, which is hurtling toward the ground. Transported to yet another world, he is rescued from a frozen river by a group of Neanderthals, and a voice comes from the harp, telling him that friends will search for him on the river.

The story moves to the late 21st century. The most significant technological change is the wide availability of virtual reality interfaces among all parts of society. The internet has been replaced by &quot;the Net,&quot; a vast network of online VR environments. In Durban, a VR programming instructor named Irene &quot;Renie&quot; Sulaweyo is teaching a Kalahari San named !Xabbu how to create such environments, while providing for her family. Her family is made up by her alcoholic father Long Joseph and her ten-year-old brother Stephen. Stephen spends much of his time online and frequently joins his friends in escapades to forbidden areas of the net. When he somehow ends up in a coma after visiting a forbidden club, she and !Xabbu decide to investigate. Inside the club, they discover a number of very unsavoury entertainments, and are very nearly trapped by the managers. Their most bizarre and horrifying discovery is a very powerful hypnotic entity, which Renie nearly dies trying to escape from. Convinced that the club is set up to damage the minds of children, as it has done to Stephen, she resolves to stop the people responsible. She finds an unusual and large piece of code, in the form of a golden diamond, on her machine, and consults her friend and mentor, Dr. Susan van Bleeck, about it. As they examine it, it erupts into an image of a golden city, then disappears. Renie&#x27;s difficulties multiply, as it becomes clear that her investigations have earned her powerful enemies: she is stood down from her job and unknown persons set fire to her family&#x27;s apartment complex. Finally, van Bleeck is brutally assaulted and dies after leaving Renie and !Xabbu with three names: Martine Desroubins, Blue Dog Anchorite, and Bolivar Atasco. The first two are hackers that agree to help them find the golden city, which is in a mysterious network called &quot;Otherland&quot;, while the third is an anthropologist and archaeologist whose expertise is pre-Columbian Latin America. Blue Dog Anchorite reveals himself to be Murat Sagar Singh, a retired programmer who worked on the security system for Otherland, and whose colleagues on the same project have been dying in unusual circumstances. He also reveals that Otherland was commissioned by a secret organisation called &quot;The Grail Brotherhood&quot;, and that Atasco, who oversaw the security project for Otherland, was an important member of that organisation. Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, and Singh plan to break into Otherland; Renie and !Xabbu, along with Long Joseph and van Bleeck&#x27;s assistant Jeremiah Dako, travel to Wasps&#x27; Nest, a mothballed military base in the Drakensberg mountains, where there is equipment allowing Renie and !Xabbu to stay connected to the Net for extended periods. Preparations completed, they hack into Otherland, but Singh is confronted and killed by the security system. He is later found dead in his room from a heart attack. Renie, !Xabbu, and Martine manage to enter Otherland and make their way to the golden city, which is called Temilún. There, they meet the God-King, who reveals himself to be Atasco.

In suburban California, a terminally-ill teenager named Orlando Gardiner has become the most celebrated warrior in Middle Country, an online VR MMORPG based on swords-and-sorcery. However, while playing the game, he is distracted by a vision of a golden city and killed by a low-level monster. With the help of his friend, Sam Fredericks, he begins to investigate. Their investigations lead to TreeHouse, an online fringe community, and to Melchior, a code name used by Singh and others. Following the trail, they are mysteriously taken to a beach on a river. Across the river, they can see the golden city. They build a raft to cross the river, but are stopped by the police and taken to the palace of the God-King.

On an army base in North Carolina, the young girl Christabel Sorensen becomes friends with Mr. Sellars, a mysterious old man living on the base. She is unaware that he is under house arrest, and her father, a senior military security officer, is in charge of guarding him. She helps him to escape from his house into a network of tunnels lying underneath the base.

The Grail Brotherhood emerges as a small number of the world&#x27;s wealthiest and most powerful people who have formed an exclusive society. Otherland is their private network, where many of them own numerous simulation worlds (others being leased out for very large sums), and they intend to use it for even more mysterious purposes. They meet in a simulation based on ancient Egypt, where their leader, Felix Jongleur, appears as Osiris and obliges other members to present themselves as various Egyptian deities. Jongleur commissions an employee, John Dread, to carry out a task referred to as the &quot;Sky God Project.&quot; Dread promises to accomplish his mission, although it is not stated what exactly he must do.

Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, Orlando, Fredericks, and four other people in similar situations find themselves imprisoned in a virtual reality world so complex that it rivals reality. There, they meet Atasco and his wife, and learn that Atasco, though formerly a member of the Grail Brotherhood, has been uninvolved for some time (though he has been permitted to retain his simulation world), and is now secretly opposing the Brotherhood&#x27;s plans. They meet the enigmatic Mr. Sellars, who tells them that the network is somehow built from the minds of catatonic children worldwide, and he calls upon the small group of adventurers to stop the Grail Brotherhood.

Before they can get their questions answered, however, the meeting descends into chaos. Unknown to any of those gathered, Dread and a team of expert assassins have attacked the Atascos&#x27; island home in Colombia, and Bolivar and his wife are suddenly murdered. Sellars gives the adventurers some brief instructions: they are to search along the river for Paul Jonas, who is at large within Otherland&#x27;s many simulation worlds, then he too vanishes. Even as the adventurers flee Temilún, Dread, with the help of criminal hacker Dulcie Anwin, hijacks the simulation body of one of their party. The group sails down the river, hoping to find the answers that will enable them to free the children from Otherland&#x27;s hold.

==Characters in &quot;City of Golden Shadow&quot;==
*Paul Jonas: A person trapped within the Otherland network. When first introduced, Paul believes himself to be a soldier condemned to the trenches of the First World War. Because he underwent &quot;treatment&quot; (brainwashing) before being introduced to the simulation, he cannot remember anything that happened more than a few days ago. As he explores the simulation, he struggles to discover who he is, as well as trying to escape from Mullet and Finch, agents of The Grail Brotherhood.
*Mullet: Supposedly a companion of Paul Jonas in the trenches. When Paul escapes the World War I simulation, however, Mullet, in various incarnations, pursues him through the other simulations of the Otherland network. Later revealed to be Mudd, an employee of Felix Jongleur.
*Finch: Mudd&#x27;s companion, who pursues Paul. His real name is Finney.
*Gally: A boy that Paul meets in the Otherland simulation, and who accompanies him in his flight from Mullet and Finch. He demonstrates to Paul the significance of the river that flows through the various simulation worlds in Otherland.
*Irene &quot;Renie&quot; Sulaweyo: A South African computer teacher, whose younger brother Stephen falls into a coma, prompting the research that leads to her discovery of the Otherland network.
*!Xabbu: A bushman from the Kalahari desert, and a student of Renie. He helps her research the cause of her brother&#x27;s coma, and enters the Otherland network with her. His spiritual guidance keeps Renie sane, as well as providing her with a viewpoint that does not take the technology of her civilization for granted.
*Stephen Sulaweyo: Renie&#x27;s eleven-year-old brother, who spends a large amount of his time in virtual reality with his friends Eddie and Soki. He falls into a coma after visiting a forbidden area of the net, and is moved to a hospital, where he remains for most of the story.
*Long Joseph Sulaweyo: Renie&#x27;s father, described as a once-honorable man who became an alcoholic after the accidental death of his wife (Renie&#x27;s mother). Apathetic about the problems and emotions of his family members, he resists Renie&#x27;s attempts to keep him safe.
*Dr. Susan van Bleeck: A rich technology expert who at one time taught Renie virtual engineering. Renie contacts her after her brother falls ill, and she is able to direct Renie to Martine Desroubins, Murat Sagar Singh, and Bolivar Atasco before agents of the Grail Brotherhood murder her.
*Jeremiah Dako: Susan van Bleeck&#x27;s butler and cook, who joins Renie and !Xabbu after van Bleeck is murdered.
*Strimbello: A man who operates an ominous club designed to entice children to enter a situation where they can be mentally damaged for the benefit of the Grail Brotherhood. He is responsible for putting Stephen into a coma, and nearly succeeds in doing the same to Renie and !Xabbu.
*Murat Sagar Singh: Also known by the code name &quot;Blue Dog Anchorite&quot;, Singh is an elderly man who was an acquaintance of Susan van Bleeck and a worker on some programming for the Otherland project. He helps Renie, !Xabbu, and Martine hack into the system, but is killed by a malevolent aspect of the Otherland security system when he tries to enter with them.
*Martine Desroubins: An acquaintance of Susan van Bleeck who lives in France, and who assists Renie and !Xabbu and enters Otherland with them. She is revealed to be blind, and interprets virtual reality through different mechanisms than the others, so the large amount of information in the Otherland system starts to drive her insane, and she is seemingly ill because of this at the end of the book.
*Orlando Gardiner: A terminally ill teenager who plays the VR MMORPG Middle Country with his best (and only) friend Fredericks. After he discovers an image of a golden city, a location in the Otherland network, he becomes obsessed with finding it. Both he and Fredericks enter Otherland, despite the fact that he is very sick with pneumonia. At the end of the book, he is unconscious and at risk of dying from his disease, cared for by members of the other eight people who also succeeded in entering Otherland.
*Salome Fredericks: Simply called Fredericks, she is a friend of Orlando&#x27;s who wears the sim of a man, but is actually a teenage girl (Orlando, her best friend, is unaware of her true gender until late into the plot). She does not approve of Orlando&#x27;s attempts to learn about Otherland, believing that they are likely to get harshly punished for their actions, but accompanies him on all of his exploits.
*Mr. Sellars: An elderly man imprisoned on an army base in North Carolina, who &#x27;recruits&#x27; Orlando and the others by leaving clues about the Otherland scattered across the net. Eventually, he meets them in Otherland, and tries to explain the situation and what they must do.
*Christabel Sorensen: A young girl living on the army base, who secretly becomes friends with Mr. Sellars and helps him escape from the army base.
*Felix Jongleur: The oldest person on earth, born before the outbreak of World War I, he is also one of the wealthiest and most powerful, and certainly one of the most ruthless. He is the leader of the Grail Brotherhood, and masterminded the creation of the Otherland system. Through much of the book, he appears in his preferred environment, a simulation of ancient Egypt, where, as Osiris, he presides over meetings of the Grail Brotherhood.
*Johnny Wulgaru: Known by his adopted name Dread, this character&#x27;s real name is only mentioned once, and then in reference to his unhappy childhood. He has the power to manipulate electronic devices, an ability he calls his &quot;twist&quot;, and views his life as a sort of movie. He makes sport of hunting and killing women. Despite his dangerous obsession with rape and murder, Jongleur, who calls him &quot;Anubis&quot;, recruits him to assassinate Atasco. He has an uneasy relationship with Jongleur, who has kept many secrets from him, and when he breaks into Otherland he welcomes the opportunities to secretly gain information about Jongleur&#x27;s plans.
*Robert Wells: A centenarian living in Oregon, where he heads the powerful technology firm Telemorphix, Wells is a member of the Grail Brotherhood, appearing in Jongleur&#x27;s Egypt as the god Ptah. While his technical expertise makes him indispensable to the Brotherhood&#x27;s plans, he is unpopular among many of the other members. He heads a minority faction which seeks to remove Jongleur from leadership.
*Daniel Yacoubian: A general in the US Army, he is also a member of the Grail Brotherhood, appearing in Jongleur&#x27;s Egypt as the god Horus. He schemes with Wells to remove Jongleur from his position of leadership.

<text>The is a member of the cabinet and is the leader and chief executive of the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. The chief cabinet secretary coordinates the policies of ministries and agencies in the executive branch, and also serves as the government&#x27;s press secretary. The secretary is a statutory member of the National Security Council, and is appointed by the emperor upon the nomination by the prime minister. The chief cabinet secretary is the second in line of succession to the prime minister, and 1st if the office of the deputy prime minister is unoccupied.

== History ==
In March 1879, the precursor of the position, the Secretary-General of the Cabinet, was created. From 1885, it was included as part of the cabinet system, and the position was known in Japanese as . The modern position was created on May 3, 1947, shortly after the passage of the Constitution of Japan, and elevated to ministerial status in 1966.

Since 1947, the office of Chief Cabinet Secretary has been regarded as a stepping stone to the post of Prime Minister. The first chief cabinet secretary to become Prime Minister was Ichirō Hatoyama, who served in the position under Tanaka Giichi. Since then, eight other former chief cabinet secretaries have become prime ministers, most recently Shinzō Abe, Yasuo Fukuda, and Yoshihide Suga.

Yoshihide Suga, who later became Prime Minister of Japan, served as Chief Cabinet Secretary under Shinzo Abe for nearly eight years, making him the longest-serving chief cabinet secretary in history, having overtaken the previous record of 1,289 days in office set by Fukuda on July 7, 2016.

The current chief cabinet secretary is Yoshimasa Hayashi, who took office on December 14, 2023.

<doc id="1097321" wikidata="Q4788619" url="?curid=1097321" title="Area code 867">
<text>Area code 867 is the area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the three Canadian territories, all of which are in Northern Canada. The area code was created on October 21, 1997, by combining regions that were previously served with area code 403 and area code 819 in one numbering plan area (NPA). As the least populated NPA in mainland North America, serving about 130,000 people, it is geographically the largest, at , with Alaska (907) a distant second.

The numbering plan area is adjacent to seven provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Quebec) and one U.S. state (Alaska), as well as Greenland and Russia (across the North Pole), more jurisdictions than any other in North America. It is also one of two Canadian area codes that are not part of an overlay numbering plan, the other being 807.

The incumbent local exchange carrier for area code 867 is Northwestel, a subsidiary of BCE. Until 1964, the geographic area served today by 867 had up to five independent telephone companies, as well as Bell Canada.

==History==
In 1947, Alberta was assigned area code 403 in the first continent-wide telephone numbering plan by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). When service became available from local regional carriers, individual locations in Yukon and the west of the Northwest Territories were served via the area code of the carrier.
These companies were eventually merged into Canadian National Telecommunications, a subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway. CNT&#x27;s operations in the territories became Northwestel in 1979.

The eastern Northwest Territories were among the last areas of North America without telephone service. When the area code system was created, the region was effectively served by western Quebec&#x27;s area code 514. In 1957, those non-diallable areas were reassigned to eastern Quebec&#x27;s area code 418. Bell Canada introduced telephone service in the eastern Northwest Territories in 1958. As direct distance dialing (DDD) was rolled out in this area in the 1970s, the eastern Northwest Territories and a large swath of northwestern Quebec were reassigned to western Quebec&#x27;s area code 819. Bell Canada sold its northern service territory to Northwestel in 1992. In 1993, Bell Communications Research, functioning as the North American Numbering Plan Administration listed the vast majority of the territories with area code 403.

Until area code 867 was created, area codes 403 and 819 had been geographically the two largest in the North American Numbering Plan. The area code commenced service on October 21, 1997. Since its creation, all of the former 819 portion of the Northwest Territories, as well as the portion of the former 403 portion covering five exchanges, has become part of Nunavut. The split reduced area code 403 for service of Alberta only.

All existing central office prefixes, with one exception, were retained in the change to area code 867. An assignment conflict between 403-979 at Inuvik and 819-979 at Iqaluit was resolved by changing Inuvik from 403-979 to 867-777. A minor programming error allowed for a few weeks late in 1997 callers in the Inuvik area to dial 403-777 and reach Inuvik when they actually should have routed to Calgary, which appeared on customer&#x27;s bills, along with the higher rate.
Northwestel&#x27;s proposal for a new regulatory regime was approved for 2007 to allow resale of local telephone service, but no competitors entered the market to avail themselves of the resale option. In 2011, facilities-based local service competition was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and so additional central office codes are now required for competitive carriers wishing to offer local service. The expense limits deployment so far to Whitehorse, Yellowknife, Inuvik, Behchokǫ̀, Aklavik and Hay River, four of which already have multiple prefixes. Communities that now have only one prefix are not likely to need a second prefix other than for local growth or the entry of a competitor (as in Aklavik and the twin Behchokǫ̀ communities, Rae-Edzo).

The sparsely-populated area is unlikely to exhaust telephone numbers in the foreseeable future.

in June 2021, the CRTC recommended implementing the three-digit code 9-8-8 for the nationwide suicide prevention hotline. The CRTC decision followed the decision of the US Federal Communications Commission to adopt 9-8-8 as the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. 988 was already in use as a local exchange in the Yellowknife area, which would require ten-digit dialing in area code 867. In August 2022, the CRTC finalized its implementation plans for 9-8-8, effective November 30, 2023; it accepted a request from Northwestel to make ten-digit dialing mandatory only in the Yellowknife area and optional elsewhere within the region as of May 31, 2023, in part because it would ease the process of communicating the transition to remote communities and in Indigenous languages.

==Numbering plan area==
Area code 867 is the most expensive geographic destination in Canada. Iristel, the major CLEC in the region, bills subscribers in other area codes a 15¢/minute premium to call 867-numbers, and charges a $20/year premium to issue a 867-number in-region instead of assigning the same subscriber any other Canadian area code.

The digits of the area code were reportedly chosen to promote the theme &quot;TOP of the world&quot;, as 867 spells &quot;TOP&quot; on a standard North American keypad. When combined with the NANP international dialing code &quot;1&quot;, it spells &quot;1867&quot;, which is the year of Canadian Confederation.

The area code serves the largest land area of any area code in the NANP. The territorial extent reaches from Cape Dyer on Baffin Island to the Alaska border, and from the south end of James Bay to the North Pole. The largest distances between exchanges are from Sanikiluaq to Grise Fiord, and from Beaver Creek to Pangnirtung. Four different official time zones are observed within the area: Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific.

===Exchanges===
Area code 867 serves all points in the three Canadian territories, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon

Some exchanges in the territories serve some customers in Fraser and Swan Lake, British Columbia (from Carcross and Swift River, respectively). Fitzgerald, Alberta, is served from Fort Smith, Northwest Territories. On a section of the Alaska Highway which crosses the BC-Yukon border six times in , two highway lodges and area residents on the Yukon side are served by Watson Lake (867) numbers, not the nearer Lower Post (250) exchange.

Ellesmere Island is the northernmost terrestrial point in Canada. On Ellesmere, conventional telephony is available at Grise Fiord (1-867-980-xxxx), population 130, but not at two remote government outposts further north: Eureka, Nunavut (80.1°N) is host to an Environment Canada weather station and Alert, Nunavut (82°N) is a Canadian Forces Station. The only outside communication to Eureka is via satellite; the weather station lists various extensions of an Ottawa 613 federal number, an Iridium satellite phone or the Winnipeg 204 number of a main Environment Canada office. As Eureka is at the northern limit of access to geosynchronous satellite signals, a string of military terrestrial UHF links extends the signal from &quot;Fort Eureka&quot; to CFS Alert. There is a skeleton crew at each location which is reachable by Internet or telephone, but these links are satellite or military communication and do not use the area code 867 infrastructure.

<text>Mabel Elizabeth King (née Washington; December 25, 1932 – November 9, 1999) was an American actress and singer. She was known for her role as Mabel &quot;Mama&quot; Thomas on the ABC sitcom &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; from its premiere in 1976 until the end of its second season in 1978. King was also known for portraying Evillene the Witch, a role she originated in the stage musical &quot;The Wiz&quot; and reprised in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s 1978 film adaptation. She recorded on the Rama Records and Amy Records labels.

==Early life==
King was born Mabel Elizabeth Washington in Charleston, South Carolina, the daughter of Rosalie Washington and Joseph Washington on Christmas Day 1932. She was raised in Harlem, New York where she eventually became a gospel and nightclub singer.

==Career==
===Stage work===
She did not start acting until her mid thirties, in 1966, when she played the role of Maria in the national touring play of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. The following year she played the role of Ernestina in the Broadway musical/comedy &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; Then in 1972, she acted in the musical film &quot;Don&#x27;t Play Us Cheap&quot;, which went unreleased until the following year, after it had been performed on Broadway as a stage play. That same year, she played the Queen of Myrthia in the horror film &quot;Ganja &amp; Hess&quot;. In January 1975, she played the role of Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West in the all-African-American cast of the Broadway musical &quot;The Wiz&quot;. The role earned her a Drama Desk Award nomination for outstanding featured actress in a musical. Her performance in &quot;The Wiz&quot; brought her much attention and soon after she received roles in the films &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot;, with Billy Dee Williams and James Earl Jones, and &quot;Scott Joplin&quot;, with Billy Dee Williams and Clifton Davis. In June 1980, King returned to stage work, starring in the Broadway musical &quot;It&#x27;s So Nice to Be Civilized&quot;. However, the show did poorly and closed after eight performances.

===Television and film===
In 1976, she was offered the role of Mabel Thomas on the sitcom &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;. Her character often used the catch phrase &quot;This is true&quot;, which she said to her children when she tried to prove a point to them. King played the role from 1976 to 1978, but due to disagreements with the direction the creators wanted to take the series, she left &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; in 1978 after two seasons. That same year, she reprised the role of Evillene for the 1978 film version of &quot;The Wiz&quot;. It was the second time in her career that she appeared in a movie after being in the stage version, the first being &quot;Don&#x27;t Play Us Cheap&quot;. The following year, she appeared in the film &quot;The Jerk&quot; as the mother to Steve Martin&#x27;s character. King received mostly guest spots on television series including &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;. In between, she signed on with then Hollywood agent Ruben Malaret, who negotiated her reprised role of Mama Johnson in the made-for-TV movie &quot;The Jerk, Too&quot; (1984). Her last two movie roles were &quot;Scrooged&quot; (1988) starring Bill Murray and &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Die&quot; (1990) starring Elliott Gould.

==Personal life==
King was married to Melvin King from June 1967 until September 1989. She and Larry Banks had one child, a son named Larry Jr., who died in 1996.

King was a staunch conservative Republican, strongly supporting the presidency of Ronald Reagan.

==Later years and death==
King was diabetic and in 1986 one of her toes was amputated as a result of the disease. In 1990, King suffered a stroke and entered the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, effectively ending her professional career. In 1991, King&#x27;s diabetes resulted in the amputation of her left leg. In 1994, her right leg was also amputated. King would also lose one of her arms to diabetes. On November 9, 1999, King died at the age of 66.

==Filmography==
==Recordings==

<doc id="1097333" wikidata="Q24488" url="?curid=1097333" title="High five">
<text>The high five is a hand gesture whereby two people simultaneously raise one hand and slap the flat of their palm against the other. The gesture is often preceded verbally by a phrase like &quot;Give me five&quot;, &quot;High five&quot;, or &quot;Up top&quot;. Its meaning varies with the context of use but can include as a greeting, congratulations, or celebration.

There are many origin stories of the high five, but the first and two most documented candidates are Dusty Baker and Glenn Burke of the Los Angeles Dodgers professional baseball team on October 2, 1977, and Wiley Brown and Derek Smith of the Louisville Cardinals men&#x27;s college basketball team during the 1978–1979 season.

==Origin==

The use of the phrase as a noun has been part of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; since 1980 and as a verb since 1981. The phrase is related to the slang &quot;give me five&quot; which is a request for some form of handshake – variations include &quot;slap me five&quot;, &quot;slip me five&quot;, &quot;give me (some) skin&quot; – with &quot;five&quot; referring to the number of fingers on a hand. The &quot;high five&quot; originated from the &quot;low five&quot;, which has been a part of African-American culture since the 1920s. The exact transition from a low five to a high is unknown, though many theories exist about its inception. Magic Johnson once suggested that he invented the high five at Michigan State, presumably in the late 1970s. Others have suggested it originated in the women&#x27;s volleyball circuit of the 1960s.

===Glenn Burke and Dusty Baker===
For decades, the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; has been that the origin of the high five occurred between Dusty Baker and Glenn Burke of the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium on October 2, 1977, the last day of the Major League Baseball (MLB) regular season. In the sixth inning, Baker hit a home run off Houston Astros pitcher J. R. Richard. It was Baker&#x27;s 30th home run of the season, making the Dodgers the first team ever to have four hitters with at least 30 home runs each in a single season. As journalist Jon Mooallem tells the story:

This story regarding the origin of the high five can be found in the written news as early as September 1982 and is featured in the ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; film &quot;The High Five&quot; directed by Michael Jacobs. After retiring from baseball, Burke, who was one of the first openly gay professional athletes, used the high five with other gay residents of the Castro district of San Francisco, and it became a symbol of gay pride.

===Louisville Cardinals===
Another origin story, first reported in 1980, places it at a University of Louisville Cardinals basketball practice during the 1978–1979 season. Forward Wiley Brown went to give a low five to his teammate Derek Smith, but suddenly Smith looked Brown in the eye and said, &quot;No. Up high.&quot; Brown thought, &quot;Yeah, why are we staying down low? We jump so high,&quot; raised his hand and the high five was supposedly born. High fives can be seen in highlight reels of the 1978–1979 Louisville team. During a telecast of a 1980 game, announcer Al McGuire shouted: &quot;Mr. Brown came to play! And they&#x27;re giving him the high-five handshake. High five!&quot;

===Magic Johnson===
Magic Johnson claims that he invented the high five. He provides no date or location for invention, only that it was a thing that he and teammate Greg Kelser did on occasion while playing for Michigan State. He did not give it a name, and asserts that Baker–Burke did not invent the high five.

===Hoax origin claimed by comedy writers===
In a 2007 press release, two comedy writers and founders of the &quot;National High Five Day&quot; claimed that a late 1970s and early &#x27;80s basketball player from Murray State University had invented the gesture. They also concocted an elaborate and involved story about this player as a young boy learning the gesture from his father. But in a 2013 &quot;ESPN&quot; article, the pair admitted that it had been a publicity stunt. Per the article, the two had &quot;scoured college basketball rosters to plug in a name.&quot;

===Antecedents===
Antecedents of the physical gesture of slapping palms together predate the 1970s, when the high five is believed to have been coined. For example, it can be seen in the 1960 French Nouvelle vague movie &quot;Breathless&quot;.

Conventional wisdom holds that the Tokyo district of Roppongi earned the slogan of &quot;High Touch Town&quot; after residents noticed World War II American soldiers walking the streets giving each other high-fives; when the Japanese asked about the gesture it was mistranslated as &quot;hai tatchi&quot; or &quot;high touch&quot;. This story is possibly apocryphal, as Hiroyuki Usui, a representative of the Roppongi Shopkeepers Promotion Association explains, &quot;There is no deep meaning in &#x27;High Touch Town&#x27;. People don&#x27;t know what it means.&quot; The term &quot;high touch town&quot; may have originated before the high five and had a different meaning, or &#x27;high touch&#x27; may mean &quot;high class&quot;, a play on the town&#x27;s reputation for nightlife activity among off-duty military personnel.

==Variations==
In addition to the classic high five several other types of high five exist.

If one initiates a high five (or any variation thereof) by offering a hand(s), and no reciprocal hand appears to consummate the gesture, the initiator is said to have been &quot;&quot;. This could be interpreted as an insult, friendly joke or form of enlightenment, depending on the context of its use.

Another variation is the &quot;self high five.&quot; The action consists of raising one hand, generally the right hand, and tagging it with the other. It was often used by professional wrestler Diamond Dallas Page as part of his persona, such as in &quot;Self High Five,&quot; his theme song in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). A variation of this variation was explored by Turkish artist Deniz Ozuygur who built a &quot;Self High-five Machine,&quot; which was exhibited in New York City in 2010. It is a robotic arm that spins in circles striking another robotic arm, both of which are rubber casts of Ozuygur&#x27;s own arms.

A hand grab is when one or both parties grab and hold, sometimes even shaking around the opposing parties hand while still up high. The variation can be used to indicate friendship and/or personal swagger. A two-handed high five is as the name suggests the same as a high five but two handed. A back end is when a normal high is followed through by swinging the arms around to slap together down low. Some will pass through a gauntlet while giving two hand high fives through a line of people.

===Too slow===
The &quot;too slow&quot; variation is a sequence of high five and low five, often accompanied by a rhyme such as &quot;Up High. Down Low ...&quot; During the down low sequence, the initiator will surprise the counter-party by pulling their hand back at the last moment, tricking the other person into swiping at empty air, completing the rhyme with &quot;Too slow!&quot; There are variations on this theme, with additions of &quot;to the side&quot; and other hand positions for the partner to contact the initiator&#x27;s hand.

The origin of the too slow variation has not been established, but the earliest documented instance is a 1982 news article in the &quot;Evansville Courier &amp; Press&quot;. A robot named Fubar interacted with customers: &quot;&#x27;Gimme three brother&#x27; he tells a shopper as he extends a golden hand with that many fingers. Then with a rapid-fire retort he confuses the greeter with &quot;Take It back! Up high! Down low! Too slow!&quot; Other notable sources have made reference to it; for example a 1983 journal is quoted as saying, &quot;Whether we hammer, or hoe, whoop or holler, as they say, slap five up high, down low, you&#x27;re too slow, we do it with the rhythmic motif that leads to harmony.&quot; The title song for &quot;Lay on Five&quot;, a BBC children&#x27;s television programme broadcast in 1985–86 featuring Floella Benjamin, ended &quot;..too slow to Lay on Five.&quot; The too slow variation is in the 1987 film &quot;The Principal&quot; in a scene where Principal Rick Latimer (James Belushi) does it to Arturo Diego (Jacob Vargas). In the &quot;New York Times&quot; archives, the earliest reference is from 1993 when Arnold Schwarzenegger did it with the son of a film-crew member while on the set of &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, saying: &quot;Let&#x27;s have five. Five high. Five low,&quot; at which point Schwarzenegger pulled his hand away saying &quot;Too slow.&quot; The boy reportedly laughed. Schwarzenegger did it originally in the 1991 film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, when John Connor (Edward Furlong) teaches the Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to &quot;Gimme five. Up high, down low, too slow.&quot; In 2008, They Might Be Giants released the song &quot;High Five!&quot; on an album for children titled &quot;Here Come the 123s&quot;, with lyrics &quot;High five! Low five! Slap me five! Down low! Too slow!,&quot; a gesture described in the song as &quot;old school&quot; a slang term usually meaning something from a prior generation. 

The rhyme bears a striking resemblance to a very old work song, possibly medieval, used by blacksmiths to teach apprentices how to best operate a bellows in a way that maximized its efficiency by opening it fully and quickly, while closing it slowly. The didactic rhyme is &quot;Up high. Down low. Up quick. Down slow; And that&#x27;s the way to blow.&quot;

===Air five===

An air five is a variation where the hands of the participants never actually touch, needing only line of sight to make the gesture. It has an advantage for participants who are otherwise too far apart to achieve physical contact at the moment of the gesture. The participants may simply pretend to high five, or add an imitation sound of hand slapping. Also known as the &quot;wi-five&quot;, a mix of &quot;wireless&quot; and &quot;high five&quot; with a pun on Wi-Fi, a wireless computer technology.

==Celebrations==
National High Five Day is a project to give out high fives and is typically held on the third Thursday in April. According to the National High Five Project, the event began in 2002 at the University of Virginia after a group of students set up a booth and gave out high-fives and lemonade. The project has held events where participants take part in a &quot;high-five-a-thon&quot; to raise funds for charity.

==Human health==

A 2014 medical study found that fist bumps and high fives spread fewer germs than handshakes.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the high-five was &quot;singled out, stigmatized and fraught with anxiety&quot;, being replaced by gestures such as knocking elbows, tapping forearms, or clicking cleats. For example, college conferences banned the high-five; the Yankees informally resolved to bump elbows instead of slapping hands; the Minnesota Twins banned physical contact with fans. Outside of sports, individuals reported avoiding the high-five in their daily lives. Dusty Baker, the presumed originator of the gesture, advocated for contactless high-fives.

<doc id="1097340" wikidata="Q5542146" url="?curid=1097340" title="George Markstein">
<text>George Markstein (29 August 1926 – 15 January 1987) was a British journalist and writer of thrillers and teleplays. He was the script editor of the British series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; for the first thirteen episodes, and appeared briefly in its title sequence. Markstein also wrote for or story-edited other television series, specialising in espionage stories, and jointly ran a successful literary agency for screenwriters.

== Life and work ==
In 1926, according to his friend Sidney Allinson, writing in &quot;George Markstein and The Prisoner&quot;, Markstein was born in Berlin, Germany, but emigrated with his Jewish family to England with the rise of Nazism. It is likely that he lived in the United States during his youth, then moved to Britain. Markstein worked as a newspaper reporter for the &quot;Southport Guardian&quot; of Southport England in 1947. 

Markstein later became a journalist for the American military tabloid, the &quot;Overseas Weekly&quot;. Due to its scandal-driven content, the paper&#x27;s U.S. G.I. readership referred to the paper as the &quot;Over Sexed Weekly&quot;. The masthead of the newspaper lists Markstein as head of the London desk.

He moved into television, first on the factual series &quot;This Week&quot;, before acting as story consultant and contributing to multiple episodes of ITC&#x27;s &quot;Court Martial&quot; (1966), and then joining &quot;Danger Man&quot; as story consultant for the last black-and-white episode (1966), then story editor for the two episodes which were made in colour (1967). Around this time he also wrote four episodes for Rediffusion&#x27;s children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Send Foster&quot; (1967), and worked on the script for Peter Yates&#x27;s &quot;Robbery&quot; (1967), a fictionalised feature film based on the 1963 Great Train Robbery.

=== &quot;The Prisoner&quot; ===

When Patrick McGoohan announced his decision to leave &quot;Danger Man&quot;, Markstein edited the basic ideas that McGoohan had worked on since 1962 that became &quot;The Prisoner&quot; series. Together with producer David Tomblin and the star McGoohan (uncredited), Markstein co-wrote the first story &quot;Arrival,&quot; and then settled in as script editor for the series. He later described the job of story editor as &quot;the key man in any series, he is the man in whose hands is the ethos of the series, the spirit of the series, and it is his job to cast the writers and the authors the way a director casts the actors and the stars&quot;.

Markstein makes a fleeting appearance at the start of almost every episode of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; – as the balding, bespectacled &#x27;man behind the desk&#x27;, to whom McGoohan&#x27;s character is seen angrily handing his letter of resignation; and played the same, non-speaking character in the episode &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;.

Markstein&#x27;s view of the series was for a more-or-less conventional action/espionage story. However, since McGoohan controlled the series as Executive Producer and owner of Everyman Films, Markstein became increasingly dissatisfied as an employee and ultimately left the series after the conclusion of the initial block of thirteen episodes. A glimpse of Markstein&#x27;s face remained in the opening credits, but it was without him that McGoohan took the series to its most surreal and existential levels in the final four episodes, and to its bizarre conclusion.

=== Later work ===
After &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, Markstein joined the new Thames Television, initially as an in-house script editor, then as story editor for the first series of a counter-espionage drama &quot;Special Branch&quot; (1969); the third and final fourth series of spy drama &quot;Callan&quot; (1970, 1972); several episodes of &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; (1969, 1971); and the first series of &quot;The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1971). He also acted as producer for the first series of &quot;Man at the Top&quot; (1970–71), a continuation of the story begun with John Braine&#x27;s 1957 &quot;Room at the Top&quot;. Markstein became Thames&#x27;s Head of Script Development, where he had input into the development of the 1974 &quot;Armchair Cinema&quot; season made by Thames&#x27;s film subsidiary Euston Films, including one-off drama &quot;Regan&quot; and its celebrated successor series &quot;The Sweeney&quot;.

Markstein again went freelance, and co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Odessa File&quot; (1974), based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth. In the same year, together with Jacqui Lyons, he co-founded the literary agency, Marjacq Scripts Ltd, initially to represent screenwriters, later also thriller writers and computer game authors. The name is a derived from Markstein&#x27;s surname and Lyon&#x27;s forename.

In addition to his interests in Marjacq, Markstein also wrote several thrillers, including &quot;The Cooler&quot; (1974), &quot;The Man From Yesterday&quot; (1976), &quot;Chance Awakening&quot; (1977, basis of the screenplay &quot;Espion, lève-toi&quot; by Yves Boisset), the historical epic &quot;Tara Kane&quot; (1978), &quot;Goering Testament&quot; (1978), &quot;Traitor for a Cause&quot; (1979), &quot;Ultimate Issue&quot; (1981), &quot;Ferret&quot; (1983), and &quot;Soul Hunters&quot; (1987).

He continued to write for television, including working on two series of &quot;Shades of Greene&quot; (1975–76) for Thames, a series of adaptations of short stories by Graham Greene, for which Markstein acted as script consultant jointly with Greene&#x27;s brother, former director-general of the BBC, Sir Hugh Greene. Other series he wrote episodes for included &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; (1978), the pilot (&quot;Storyboard: The Traitor&quot;) and two further episodes of &quot;Mr. Palfrey of Westminster&quot; (Thames, 1983, 1984, 1985), and one episode of &quot;Philip Marlowe, Private Eye&quot; (Thames, 1986). His final television work was as story editor on the six part series &quot;London Embassy&quot; (Thames, 1987), based on a book of short stories by Paul Theroux about the unusual experiences of an American diplomat based in London.

For the cinema he wrote the initial synopsis for the 1982 SAS embassy-storming film &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;, which was then turned into a novel &quot;The Tiptoe Boys&quot; in thirty days flat by author James Follett and then into a screenplay by screenwriter Reginald Rose. James Follett, who began writing professionally in 1973, has described George Markstein as his &quot;guru&quot;, and is still represented by Markstein&#x27;s company Marjacq.

Following a long illness, Markstein died of kidney failure in 1987.

<doc id="1097369" wikidata="Q781814" url="?curid=1097369" title="Aka people">
<text>The Aka or Biaka (also Bayaka, Babenzele) are a nomadic Mbenga pygmy people. They live in south-western Central African Republic and in northern Republic of the Congo. They are related to the Baka people of Cameroon, Gabon, northern Congo, and southwestern Central African Republic.

Unlike the Mbuti pygmies of the eastern Congo (who speak only the language of the tribes with whom they are affiliated), the Aka speak their own language along with whichever of the approximately 15 Bantu peoples they are affiliated.
In 2003, the oral traditions of the Aka were proclaimed one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. They were featured in the July 1995 National Geographic article &quot;Ndoki: the Last Place on Earth&quot;, and a 3-part TV series.
==Society==
A traditional hunter-gatherer society, the Aka have a varied diet that includes 63 plants, 28 species of game and 20 species of insect, in addition to nuts, fruit, honey, mushrooms and roots. Some Aka have recently taken up the practice of planting their own small seasonal crops, but agricultural produce is more commonly obtained by trading with neighboring villages, whom the Aka collectively term as Ngandu.

From the Ngandu, they obtain manioc, plantain, yams, taro, maize, cucumbers, squash, okra, papaya, mango, pineapple, palm oil, and rice in exchange for the bushmeat, honey, and other forest products the Aka collect. There are over 15 different village tribes with whom the approximately 30,000 Aka associate.

As a result of their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, which frequently exposes them to the blood of jungle fauna, they have among the highest rates of seropositivity for Ebola virus in the world.

=== Sex roles ===
In the Aka community, despite a sexual division of labor where women primarily serve as caregivers, male and female roles are highly flexible and interchangeable. Women hunt while men care for children, and vice versa, without stigma or loss of status. Women are not only as likely as men to hunt but can even be more proficient hunters. Aka women have been observed hunting even during late stages of pregnancy and returning to hunting shortly after childbirth, sometimes even carrying newborns while hunting.

While tasks and decision-making were largely shared activities, leadership roles such as kombeti (leader), tuma (elephant hunter), and nganga (top healer) are consistently held by men in a community studied by anthropologist Barry Hewlett.

===Parenting===
Physical closeness is highly valued in the upbringing of young children among the Aka community. Babies, starting from around three months old, are almost constantly held by either one of their parents or another caregiver. It is uncommon to find a cot in an Aka camp because it&#x27;s unheard of for parents to leave their baby unattended; instead, infants are held all the time. Fathers of the Aka tribe spend more time in close contact to their babies than in any other known society. Aka fathers have their infant within arms&#x27; reach 47% of the time and make physical contact with them five times as often per day as fathers in some other societies. Aka fathers are even known to bring their infants along to social gatherings, such as their equivalent of a pub, with the baby attached to their chest or even nursing from their nipple, while they enjoy palm wine with other men. The men also help the women, by feeding their children. It is believed that this is related to the strong bond between Aka husband and wife. Throughout the day, couples share hunting, food preparation, and social and leisure activities.

==History==
The lifestyle of the Aka has been shifted from their traditional customs by European colonialism. The slave trade of the 18th century caused the migration of several tribes into Aka lands. These tribes subsequently became affiliated with the Aka. By the end of the 19th century, the Aka were the major elephant hunters providing tusks for the ivory trade. Affiliated tribes acted as middlemen in these transactions.

From 1910 to 1940, the Aka lands were part of French Equatorial Africa, and nearby affiliated tribes were forced into rubber production by the colonialists. These laborers occasionally escaped into forests inhabited by the Aka, increasing the demand for bushmeat. To meet this demand, the Aka developed the more efficient method of net hunting to replace traditional spear hunting. This caused a change in the social structure of the Aka: net hunting was seen as less physically challenging than using spears to kill game, and so women were encouraged take part in hunting activities.

In the 1930s, the French pressed the Aka to move into roadside villages. However, like the Efé of the Ituri rainforest, most Aka disobeyed and retreated into the jungle, with few joining the new settlements (except for a few villages in Congo-Brazza).

Today, economic pressures have forced the Aka to further deviate from their traditional customs. Many Aka now work in the coffee plantations of neighbouring tribes during the dry season instead of hunting as they would have done, and others have found employment in the ivory and lumber trade.

==Conservation efforts==
The World Wildlife Fund of Washington, DC, has worked with the Aka since the 1980s to protect gorilla habitats, minimize logging of forest, and promote other conservation efforts while empowering the Aka and other indigenous peoples. 

At a United States congressional hearing in 2021, John H. Knox testified that WWF provided financial and material support to Protected areas in Africa despite knowing, often for many years, that human rights abuses were alleged to have taken place there. 

==Music==
Their complex polyphonic music has been studied by various ethnomusicologists. Simha Arom has made historical field recordings of some of their repertoire. Michelle Kisliuk has written a detailed performance ethnography. Mauro Campagnoli studied their musical instruments in depth, comparing them to neighbouring pygmy groups such as the Baka Pygmies.

Aka musicians appear on &quot;African Rhythms&quot; (György Ligeti, Steve Reich and Pierre-Laurent Aimard, 2003), &quot;Echoes of the Forest: Music of the Central African Pygmies&quot; (Ellipsis Arts, 1995), &quot;BOYOBI: Ritual Music of the Rainforest Pygmies&quot; (Louis Sarno, 2000), and &quot;Bayaka: The Extraordinary Music of the BaBenzele Pygmies&quot; (Louis Sarno, 1996).

==Films==
The 2013 film &quot;Song from the Forest&quot; tells the story of American Louis Sarno who lived among the Bayaka pygmies in the Central African rainforest for 25 years and travels with his son, 13-year-old Samedi, to New York City.

<text>Julius Benjamin Richmond (September 26, 1916 – July 27, 2008) was an American pediatrician and public health administrator. He was a vice admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and served as the United States Surgeon General and the United States Assistant Secretary for Health during the Carter Administration, from 1977 to 1981. Richmond is noted for his role in the creation of the Head Start program for disadvantaged children, serving as its first national director.

==Biography==

=== Early years ===
Richmond was born in Chicago. He was educated during the Great Depression, earning his B.S. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, followed by an M.S. in physiology and his M.D. from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in 1939. After completing an 18-month rotating internship at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, Richmond entered two pediatrics residencies, the first at Chicago&#x27;s Municipal Contagious Disease Hospital (1941–1942) and the second at Cook. The United States’ entry into World War II interrupted Richmond&#x27;s postgraduate training, as he volunteered and was inducted into the Army Air Corps in February 1942. Through 1946 Richmond worked as a flight surgeon with the Air Force&#x27;s Flying Training Command.

===Career===
After demobilization, Richmond completed his residency and began what would be a distinguished academic career in which public service was an integral part of scholarly research. He began as a professor in pediatrics at his alma mater (1946–53) and a Markle Foundation scholar in medical science (1948–53), and was active both in nonprofit children&#x27;s welfare organizations and Chicago&#x27;s Institute for Psychoanalysis. During 1953 he moved to the State University of New York at Syracuse College of Medicine (now known as the Upstate Medical Center). The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) inspired Richmond and his colleague, Betty Caldwell, to turn their interdisciplinary research, integrating elements of psychiatry into pediatrics, toward policy ends as they documented how poverty threatened the psychosocial development of young children. They focused on cognitive abilities developed during a child&#x27;s first years, where functional deficits linked to poverty, for example, those caused by malnutrition, could make learning more difficult and as a result, put the children of the poor at risk of failing both at school and later on, in attempts to advance economically.

Richmond&#x27;s work at Syracuse caught the eye of Sargent Shriver, head of the Kennedy Foundation. After President Lyndon B. Johnson tapped Shriver to head a new independent agency, the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) (1964), Shriver convinced Richmond to take a leave of absence and join him. At OEO Richmond would use a demonstration grants mechanism to create two important new public health programs that incorporated OEO&#x27;s mandate to aid local groups directly, rather than channeling resources through state health departments, the traditional partners of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare&#x27;s Public Health Service. During 1965, Richmond implemented Project Head Start, an enrichment program for disadvantaged pre-school age children that was greeted eagerly by community groups. Building on health-related proposals submitted in response to Head Start, in 1966 Richmond sponsored a series of Neighborhood Health Centers that united economic development and local oversight of, and participation in, health services delivery.

In 1967, Richmond left OEO to return to Syracuse, to serve as Dean of the medical faculty. During 1971 he moved to Harvard Medical School, where he held professorships in two departments, Child Psychiatry and Human Development (1971–73) and Preventive &amp; Social Medicine (1971–79), directed the Judge Baker Guidance Center in Boston (1971–77), a nonprofit mental health organization that works with Boston&#x27;s juvenile courts, and also served as Chief of Psychiatry at the Children&#x27;s Hospital Boston.

===Surgeon General===
Nearly a decade later after Richmond stepped down from OEO, former OEO official Joseph Califano, now President Jimmy Carter’s Secretary of DHEW, asked him to return to Federal service as Assistant Secretary for Health (July 1977). Richmond accepted, on condition that his position as Assistant Secretary, with its line authority over PHS, be combined with that of Surgeon General, widely recognized as a spokesperson for public health. Califano obliged with a December 1977 inhouse reorganization that boosted and streamlined PHS&#x27;s management capabilities through its Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH).

Richmond brought a commitment to access and equity that reflected his earlier work implementing President Johnson&#x27;s Great Society. In national health affairs, however, the latter half of the 1970s was a period of retrenchment and effort to curb health-related expenditures. Economic downturns challenged the country&#x27;s willingness to support a continued expansion of health care programs and after 1974, the removal of wage and price controls on health care providers meant dramatic cost increases for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Many believed that controls were a necessary prerequisite to any form of national health insurance, and the type of controls became a point of contention, for example, with the Congress opposing the Carter Administration&#x27;s decision to focus on hospital expenditures.

Despite the times, Richmond&#x27;s neighborhood health centers remained, championed by Congress and reinforced by an assortment of PHS programs to improve access to care. Transferred to PHS jurisdiction in the early 1970s, neighborhood health centers were renamed Community Health Centers, authorized under 1975 legislation, scaled down and revamped to focus on rural (1975) and urban (1977) areas, spread thin to include new constituencies like residents of Appalachia and migrant workers and those served by PHS&#x27;s National Health Service Corps. During Richmond&#x27;s tenure, Congress would pass the Health Services and Centers Act of 1978 (PL95-626), which reauthorized a broad array of public health services, community and migrant health centers, grants for primary care projects, and grants-in-aid to support public health programs and authorized $2.9 billion in expenditures. The health of children also remained a top priority. The Communicable Disease Center (CDC) carried out a successful immunization campaign that focused on measles and other childhood diseases that disproportionately affected the poor, meeting an initial goal of immunizing at least 90 percent of eligible children by October 1979. In addition, there were efforts to establish a Child Health Assurance Program to improve prevention by broadening eligibility for the existing Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment Program.

At PHS Richmond remains best known for his leadership in devising and implementing quantitative goals for public health, first published in 1979 as &quot;Healthy People: The Surgeon General’s Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention&quot;. &quot;Healthy People&quot; moved PHS beyond its limited capabilities to lessen disparities in health services provision, to spur change by getting information out to journalists, health departments, and others about gains already made in reduced mortality from noninfectious causes. Richmond and Secretary Califano drew on the precedent of former Surgeon General Luther Terry&#x27;s 1964 Report on Smoking and Health to build professional and public consensus toward making prevention key to PHS&#x27;s efforts.

A new Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (1979) under Assistant Surgeon General Michael McGinnis prepared the formal publication, setting forth ambitious health goals to be achieved by 1990, and the Institute of Medicine drafted an accompanying volume, &quot;Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives For The Nation&quot; (1980), which included a series of specific targets within set categories for each age-group. One of the major goals of this effort was to educate people on how they could take more personal responsibility for their health through wise lifestyle choices. Richmond&#x27;s Healthy People campaign was a remarkable success, especially in light of the political firestorm in Congress and by the tobacco industry when Secretary Califano became an outspoken critic of cigarette smoking as a major contributor to preventable disease.

===Later years===
After the Reagan Administration assumed power in January 1981, Richmond stepped down from his dual post and returned to academe.

At Harvard, Richmond would serve as a Professor of Health Policy (1981–1988) and as the John D. MacArthur Professor of Management and Director of the Division of Health Policy Research and Education (1987 onward) and as well chair the steering committee of the National Academy of Sciences&#x27; Forum on the Future of Children and Families (NAS). From 1988 he was Emeritus at Harvard Medical School in the Department of Social Medicine (DSM), now the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, which he had founded under HMS Dean Robert Ebert.

Richmond died of cancer at age 91 at his home in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, near Boston, on July 27, 2008.

A collection of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

<text>Comédie+ (formerly Comédie!) is a French pay television channel dedicated to humour since 1997. It is directed by Dominique Farrugia, a former member of the Les Nuls comedy team.

==History==
Comédie! began its broadcasts on 29 November 1997 on Canal Satellite and then on cable. The channel is dedicated to the actor and comedian Bruno Carette from the troupe Les Nuls, who died in 1989. The channel had a daily show named &quot;La Grosse Émission&quot; which helped popularize the comedians troupe Les Robins des Bois (The Robinhoods) and famous personalities such as Cyril Hanouna, Kad Merad and Olivier Baroux. The show ran until June 2002 and had a revival in 2015-2016, and a prime-time show &quot;La Très Grosse Emission&quot; on Canal+ in 2016.

In 2003, the channel was bought by Pathé, which reformatted it to make it a mini-generalist of laughter and humor. As of September 20, 2003, its programs began at 8 a.m. Monday through Sunday. Following its withdrawal from television, Pathé sold the channel at the end of 2004 to multiThématiques, a subsidiary of Groupe Canal+.

The channel had been selected in 2005 to be among the pay-TV digital terrestrial television (TNT) channels shared with Cuisine TV, but its authorization was canceled shortly afterwards.

On 1 July 2015, Canalsat made a full transition to MPEG-4 and HD, Comédie+ switched to HD at this date.

On 1 July 2016, Comédie+, Infosport+, Planète+ and Planète+ A&amp;E were removed of Numericable, because they lost their exclusivity exemption because of the launch of SFR fiber offers with Numericable TV bouquets. Since 19 March 2019, all Canal bouquets are available on SFR TV cable and fiber platform.

In August 2018, Canal+ launched a premium channel dedicated to humor for the African market (on channel 5 of Canal+ Afrique), which was replaced by Canal+ Pop on 30 September 2021.

<text>The Aka, also known as Hrusso, are an ethnic group of Indian state Arunachal Pradesh. They are found in various areas of Arunachal Pradesh including the Thrizino Bhalukpong, Buragaon, Jamiri, Palizi, Khuppi area in West Kameng. Their language belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family.

== Lifestyle ==

For the convenience of administration, the Aka people elects a chief, who often acts the role of the village headman. Polygamy is widely practiced in their patrilineal society, and cross-cousin marriages are accepted. Like most tribes, the Aka have an elementary caste system, the aristocrat Kutsun and the commoner Kevatsum.

The Aka practice shifting cultivation and rear domestic animals such as the Mithun. Temporary huts, accommodated by young boys, are built near the field to guard the crops from the animals. The staple food of Akas is maize and millet. They plant leaves, pulses, potato and rice. Drinks locally made from fermented maize and millet include Lao pani, Mingri and the Aarah.
The Aka live in elongated houses made from bamboo, wood and cane leaves. Raised on platforms about 6 feet above the ground, the Aka house are further sub-divided into three sections. The granary is built away from the main house.

== Culture ==

The Aka share strong cultural affinities with the Miji, and intermarriage with the Miji is prevalent. Centuries of Vaishnava and intermittent Tibetan influence from the Sherdukpen has shaped the Aka culture into its modern form. Handicrafts, basket weaving and wood carving are the principal arts among the Aka tribe. Intermittent Tibetan contacts is evidenced by the fact that the Aka and Mishmis are known as &quot;Khakhra&quot; (meaning barbarians) to the Tibetans.

One of the most notable features of Aka arts is the Chinese design of the Jana flower, which can be often found on many of the indigenous haversacks. It is a known legend that the Jana flower represents the commemorate an ancient Tibetan king, who was believed to have led his entire life through daily reincarnations. It was also believed that he lived in an open giant palace that grew the Jana flowers every time the sun sets.

Indigenous festivals under the guidance of a village Chieftains such as those of the four-day Nechido festival, held in November involves the affiliation with the natural world and community.

===Dual language===

Among the Aka live a second group of people, with their own language, the Koro. They are culturally integrated with the Aka, but have somehow maintained their separate, only distantly related Tibeto-Burman language. Koro has more similarities with the Tani language group, in easternmost Tibet. There are thought to be 800 to 1200 remaining speakers of Koro, and 4,000 to 6,000 speakers of Aka.

== Costume ==

The Aka costume deeply reflects its indigenous culture. While both male and female keep long hair, there are distinctions in the dress within the Aka. These restrictions involve the use of the Assamese silk and the Tibetan knobbed hat, which are worn among the aristocrats.

Generally, most men wear a silky Assamese toga, while the women wear a long, dark-red garment that covers the entire body. Indigenous lingchong cream manufactured from the pine-resin serves as the cosmetics for the Aka women. However, the interesting cane cap reaching three inches high inserted with two bird-feathers serves the highlight of the Aka costume.

Silver ornaments play another important role in the female Aka costume. Vase-shaped earrings and for the richer ones, a fillet of silver chain is worn around the head. The rich Aka women wear a pretty filet of silver chain-work round the head. Jade beads are also made into necklaces.

Face tattooing is another notable feature among some Aka. Especially in the case of the women, they tattoo their faces in a straight line from the forehead to the chin.

== Religion ==

The Aka are mainly Animists–who are described to follow a variant of the Nyezi-No religion, which means Sky and Earth. Occasional contacts with the Assamese and neighbouring Buddhist tribes and Tibetans have seen Hindu and Buddhist influence imbibed beliefs and culture. However, centuries of Buddhist and Hindu influences have greatly shaped the religious rites of their religion. For instance, veneration of the Assamese Hindu God, Hori Deo came as a result of the imprisonment of a local Aka king, Tagi Raja. Superstitions and magic play an important role in their belief system. Shizhou proved to be the most popular form of magic ritual among the Aka, and anybody who is angry may resort to conducting Shizhou rituals on their foe.

The rituals of Shizhou involve slaughtering a dog, draining the blood from its head, and either sprinkling a few drops of the blood onto the enemy undetected, throwing them into his house, or burning them in his hearth. If the ritual succeeds, the enemy is supposed to lose their life.

<text>Deadbeat parent is a pejorative term referring to parents who do not fulfill their parental responsibilities, especially when they evade court-ordered child support obligations or custody arrangements. They are also referred to as absentee fathers and mothers. The gender-specific deadbeat father and deadbeat mother are commonly used to refer to people who have parented a child and intentionally fail to pay child support ordered by a family law court or statutory agency such as the Child Maintenance Service.

==Child support arrears==
According to the United States Census Bureau, 42% of custodial mothers (as &quot;obligees&quot;) received all child support that they were owed and 70.5% received some in 2009. Additionally, 34.1% of custodial fathers (as &quot;obligees&quot;) received all child support that they were owed and 72.9% received some.

Child support assessments are made based on a variety of formulae, and vary from state to state in the United States. According to one study 38% of Illinois &quot;obligor&quot; parents not paying child-support said they lacked the money to pay; 23% used non-payment to protest a lack of visitation rights; and 69% complained of no accountability over the spending of their child support money, while 13% said they did not want their child or children and 12% denied parentage, (see paternity fraud).

According to a California study, 76% of the $14.4 billion in child support arrears in California has been attributed to &quot;obligors&quot; who lack the ability to pay (see Figure 1, pp. 5-4). In California, the &quot;deadbeat&quot; parents had a median annual income of $6349, arrears of $9447, ongoing support of $300 per month. One reason given for this was that 71% of the orders were set by default—meaning that person who supposedly owes support was not personally served with a notice to appear before the court or administrative agency. A notice is sent to the last known address, which may have changed.

Alternative terms for deadbeat parents who lack the ability to pay are &quot;deadbroke&quot; and &quot;turnip&quot; (as in &quot;you can&#x27;t get blood out of a turnip&quot;).

==Child support enforcement in the United States==
===Legislation===

The U.S. law known as the Bradley Amendment was passed in 1986 to automatically trigger a non-expiring lien whenever child support becomes overdue.
* The law overrides any state&#x27;s statute of limitations. 
* The law disallows any judicial discretion, even from bankruptcy judges.
* The law requires that the payment amounts be maintained without regard for the physical capability of the person owing child support to promptly notify the authorities of changes in their circumstances, or their awareness of the need to make the notification.

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, 42 U.S.C. 653a, established in 1997 a New Hire Registry in which all employers in the United States, private or public, State and Federal, must report all newly hired employees within 20 days or less depending on how they report. The report includes name, address and Social Security number of each new employee. States are required to match reports of newly hired employees against social security numbers of persons having outstanding child support orders, and to issue an order to the employer to withhold and forward unpaid child support payments.

Many U.S. states have passed laws that allows the Department of Public Safety in the state to use its information to find the non-compliant parent and call them to account for their actions.

There are now many collections-oriented sites on the Internet that mention or highlight deadbeat parents, some even showing mug shots and marking the photos as &quot;found&quot; in the style of the FBI&#x27;s &quot;most wanted&quot; list.

===Action taken against defaulting parents===
In the United States, persons in arrears for child support payments are potentially subject to incarceration. Other penalties for child-support non-payment also exist. Many U.S. states suspend an individual&#x27;s licenses (i.e. driver&#x27;s license, business license, contractor license) if that individual has significant arrearage in support payments or does not consistently pay support. This authority does not extend to professionals who receive licensure through non-governmental agencies. In 2000, the state of Tennessee revoked the driver&#x27;s licenses of 1,372 people who collectively owed more than $13 million USD in child support. In Texas non-custodial parents behind more than three months in child-support payments can have court-ordered payments deducted from their wages, can have federal income tax refund checks, lottery winnings, or other money that may be due from state or federal sources intercepted by child support enforcement agencies, can have licenses (including hunting and fishing licenses) suspended, and a judge may sentence a nonpaying parent to jail and enter a judgment for past due child support. However, on 4 September 1998, the Supreme Court of Alaska upheld a law allowing state agencies to revoke driver&#x27;s licenses of parents seriously delinquent in child support obligations. And in the case of &quot;United States of America v. Rosen&quot;, U.S. Court of Appeals (2nd Cir., 1996), the court upheld the constitutionality of a law allowing federal fines and up to two years imprisonment for a person willfully failing to pay more than $5,000 in child support over a year or more when said child resides in a different state from that of the non-custodial parent.

Socially, deadbeat parents risk motivating their children to violate filial responsibility laws when they are grown.

<doc id="1097397" wikidata="Q921609" url="?curid=1097397" title="Votive candle">
<text>A votive candle or prayer candle is a small candle, typically white or beeswax yellow, intended to be burnt as a votive offering in an act of Christian prayer, especially within the Anglican, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic Christian denominations, among others. In Christianity, votive candles are commonplace in many churches, as well as home altars, and symbolize the &quot;prayers the worshipper is offering for him or herself, or for other people.&quot; The size of a votive candle is often two inches tall by one and a half inches diameter, although other votive candles can be significantly taller and wider. In other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, similar offerings exist, which include diyas and butter lamps.

==Use by Christian denominations==
Candles are lit for prayer intentions. To &quot;light a candle for someone&quot; indicates one&#x27;s intention to say a prayer for another person, and the candle symbolizes that prayer. Many times, &quot;a board is placed nearby with names of those for whom prayer is requested.&quot; A donation box is usually placed near a votive candle rack in order that Christians lighting the votive candles can help defray the cost of votive candles, and make a votive offering to the church.

===Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy===

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, candles are lit before icons, usually of Jesus Christ or the Theotokos. Usually Orthodox churches only use long, thin candles. These are usually placed in round containers, having either various sockets to hold the candles, or in a container filled with sand in which the worshipers place their candles. Orthodox churches will usually have a separate place to put candles lit for the departed; Lutheran, Anglican and Roman Catholic churches make no such distinction.

===Catholicism===
In the Roman Catholic Church, candles are at times placed before a statue of Jesus, of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or of some other saint. Often, in older or traditional churches, this will be before a bye-altar.

A votive candle signifies literally that the lighting is done in fulfillment of a vow (Latin, &quot;votum&quot;), although in most cases the intention is to give honor and to seek help from the saint before whose images the candle is lit and to pray for the dead.

Candles used may vary from long, taper-type candles to tealight candles. Tealight candles are either placed in holders or just on a platform in front of the statue. Long candles may be placed in a special holder.

===Lutheranism===
Lutheran churches may use votive candles which may be lit at home, as a part of personal or family devotions, or at the church. They are usually lit on the altar rails, or in front of the altar cross. They are also often lit during the liturgy of Good Friday.
Within the Nordic Lutheran churches of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland, all High Church Lutheran denominations, the use of votive candles is commonplace and most, if not all, churches and chapels will have a votive candle holder (Swedish: Ljusbärare). These are somewhat similar to the Eastern Orthodox type, usually a round metal frame with several sockets surrounding a central, larger candle on which to light the votive candles. As in Eastern Orthodox Churches, Nordic Lutheran votive candles are also long and thin.

===Anglicanism===
Some Anglican churches, especially those that worship in the High Church or Anglo-Catholic tradition, have votive candles for purposes of praying for the dead as well as asking for saintly intercession.

===Methodism===
In the United Methodist Church, those churches which worship in the High Church tradition make use of votive candles. During the liturgical celebration of Allhallowtide, especially on All Saints&#x27; Day (All Hallows&#x27; Day), votive candles are lit and a prayer is said for each person of the congregation who has died that year.

===Reformed===
In the Reformed tradition (inclusive of the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregationalist denominations), votive candles are lit during Totensonntag, a holy day that commemorates the faithful departed.

== History ==

During all the Middle Ages the burning of lamps, or sometimes candles, before relics, shrines, statues, and other objects of devotion was a form of piety which greatly appealed to the alms of the faithful. Almost every collection of early English wills bears witness to it, and even in the smaller churches the number of such lights founded by private beneficence was often surprisingly great. It not infrequently happened that every guild and association maintained a special light of its own, and, besides these, there were such objects of devotion as the &quot;Jesus light&quot;, the &quot;Hok-light&quot; (which seems to have to do with a popular festival kept on the second Monday or Tuesday after Easter Sunday), the &quot;Rood light&quot;, the &quot;egg light&quot; (probably maintained by contributions of eggs), the &quot;bachelor&#x27;s light&quot;, the &quot;maiden&#x27;s light&quot;, the &quot;Soul&#x27;s light&quot;, etc. Many of these bequests will be found conveniently illustrated and classified in Leland Duncan and Arthur Hussey&#x27;s &quot;Testamenta Cantiana&quot;, London 1906.

== Secular adaptions ==
In the 2010s, votive candles have been sold with celebrities or political figures fashioned to look like saints. Some secular subjects of votive candles include Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Jonathan Van Ness. The secular appropriation of votive candles, a religious symbol, has caused controversy. Kim Kardashian faced backlash after selling an $18 votive candle with her face in the likeness of the Virgin Mary. In 2019, &quot;Vox&quot; wrote that &quot;by replacing a saint with a celebrity that is outright silly (like Steve Buscemi or Harambe the gorilla), you are dismissing the function of the prayer candle altogether.&quot; Bill Donohue of the Catholic League said he didn&#x27;t find the candles offensive. &quot;By definition, a celebrity doesn&#x27;t need a PR presence, so the likely motivating force is narcissism,&quot; he says. &quot;By ripping off Catholic iconography, these celebs pay a backhanded compliment to the Catholic Church in their quest for notoriety.&quot;

==Composition==
Votive candles are made from different types of waxes including paraffin, soy wax, or beeswax. There are different grades of wax with different melting points. Paraffin is often mixed with other types of waxes, such as beeswax or vegetable wax. This is done to obtain the rigidity necessary for the type of candle being made. The speed at which the candle burns depends on the composition of the wax. A taper candle that sits in a ring-shaped candle holder may have a low melting point and produce little to no oil, whereas a votive candle set in a glass cup may have a very low melting point and turn to oil. Pillar candles, large candles often with multiple wicks, have their own formula. Soy jar candles tend to have a lower melting point than pillars and votive candles. Candle quality also varies widely depending on the candle maker. The aroma of a lighted scented candle is released through the evaporation of the fragrance from the hot wax pool and from the solid candle itself.

Lead wicks are unlikely to be found in any candle sold in the U.S. today: lead-core wicks have been banned from the U.S. since 2003, and members of the National Candle Association – which account for more than 90% of candles made in the U.S. – have not used lead wicks for more than 30 years. Reputable manufacturers use cotton, cotton-paper, zinc-core or tin-core wicks, all of which are known to be safe.

<doc id="1097404" wikidata="Q1820024" url="?curid=1097404" title="Leotis Martin">
<text>Leotis Martin (March 10, 1939 – November 20, 1995) was an American boxer, the first ever NABF heavyweight champion. Martin is best known for his victory over former-undisputed heavyweight champion Sonny Liston. A good puncher and fairly skilled heavyweight, he compiled a record of 31 wins (19 KOs) and 5 losses from 1962 to 1969. Outside of Liston, he also won against top contenders Alvin Lewis, Karl Mildenberger, Thad Spencer, Sonny Banks, and Roberto Davila, and was listed by &quot;The Ring&quot; as one of the 100 greatest punchers of all time. His career, however, was marked by inconsistency and bad luck.

==Amateur career==
Martin was the 1960 Chicago and Intercity Golden Gloves 160-pound champion and the 1961 160-pound Intercity Golden Gloves Champion (alternate). He also was the United States National AAU 165-pound champion in 1960 and 1961.

==Professional career==

From February 1964, when Martin fought on the Liston-Clay world heavyweight championship fight undercard, to June 1967, Martin fought 15 times without suffering a defeat. This winning streak qualified him for the WBA heavyweight elimination championship series, after the organization had stripped Muhammad Ali of its world heavyweight crown when he refused induction into the United States Army. On May 10, 1965, he faced Sonny Banks, then one of only two fighters to have knocked Muhammad Ali down for a count. Martin scored a ninth-round knockout over Banks. Martin&#x27;s jubilation was short lived. Banks never recovered from the blows he received during the fight and died from his injuries.

Although Martin was selected for the WBA title elimination tournament, he was matched, in his first fight, against the ultimate tournament winner Jimmy Ellis. The two fought in the Houston Astrodome on August 5, 1967. Ellis, as was his style at the time, came out sharp, trying to score an early knockout with his sneaky-fast and dangerous right hand. Although unable to knock Martin out, Ellis inflicted a nasty cut on the inside of Martin&#x27;s mouth, which ultimately caused the fight to be stopped in the ninth round. Scoring was around even at that point. Many had predicted Martin might win the elimination series. Martin had campaigned for a contest with fellow Philadelphian Joe Frazier, but it never happened, mainly due to Martin&#x27;s loss to Bonavena, who got the Frazier match instead.

Martin rebounded from the Ellis defeat by traveling to Germany to knock out German and European heavyweight champion Karl Mildenberger in seven rounds. Martin appeared to be back in contention for a title shot when he dropped a decision to California heavyweight Henry Clark (record 14-3-2). He then came back from that defeat to upset and knock out Thad Spencer in nine rounds. His title quest, however, was again derailed when Martin travelled to Argentina to meet Oscar Bonavena in his home town of Buenos Aires, where he lost by decision. Bonavena went on to fight Frazier for the world title.

After the Bonavena loss, Martin put together a four-fight win streak, including two wins over Detroit hometown favorite Al &quot;Blue&quot; Lewis. These fine efforts landed him a match with veteran former champion Sonny Liston on December 6, 1969. Liston had resumed boxing after his two stunning losses to Muhammad Ali, and had run off a winning streak of 14 fights with 13 knockouts. Although slowed by age, Liston was still a feared heavyweight.

Martin, who formerly had been Liston&#x27;s sparring partner, devised a simple fight plan. Rather than attempting to slug with the bigger and heavier Liston, Martin stayed away from him, boxing and waiting for the older man to tire. Despite a close call in the fourth round when Liston caught him with a booming left hook that knocked Martin down, Martin seemed to get stronger with every passing round while Liston weakened. Finally, in the ninth round, Martin hit Liston with a powerful combination that knocked the former champion out. This victory was short-lived, however: Martin had suffered a detached retina during the fight, and was forced to retire before he could capitalize on the biggest win of his career.

==After boxing==
For the next 26 years, Martin lived a quiet life in the Mount Airy section of Philadelphia. Early in 1995, he retired from Budd &amp; Co. after 31 years as a machinist. In November that year, Martin had a stroke brought on by hypertension and complications from diabetes, and died en route to a local hospital, aged 56.

Martin&#x27;s death received little coverage in the boxing media.

<text>Brian Eric Bonsall (born December 3, 1981) is an American rock musician, singer, guitarist and former child actor. He is perhaps best known for his roles as Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Keaton, the youngest child on the NBC sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; from 1986 until 1989, and Alexander Rozhenko, the son of Worf and K&#x27;ehleyr, on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; from 1992 to 1994.

== Early life and acting career ==
Bonsall was born in Torrance, California, to Garth Bonsall and his wife Kathleen Coleman. In 1986, he began playing the role of Andy Keaton in the sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot;. Bonsall won three Young Artist Awards for his performance on the series. He was also nominated for a Young Artist Award for his starring role in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Do You Know the Muffin Man?&quot; in 1990.

He made his feature film debut in 1992 in the horror film &quot;Mikey&quot;, playing the title role, a demonic young boy who murders his parents and terrorizes his adoptive parents. This caused controversy in the UK owing to its depiction of a child killer at a time when the murder of James Bulger had raised sensitivity about violent behavior by children. The film was initially passed uncut by the British Board of Film Classification, but its certificate was withdrawn by James Ferman in the wake of the Bulger killing.

Bonsall is known for playing Alexander Rozhenko, son of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;″s Klingon security officer, Worf, a recurring role he played for seven episodes across several seasons.

He played Patrick Swayze&#x27;s son in the 1993 film &quot;Father Hood&quot;. In 1994, he starred in the Disney comedy &quot;Blank Check&quot; and co-starred with Bob Saget in the TV movie comedy &quot;Father and Scout&quot;. His other acting credits include the TV movie &quot;Mother Goose Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rhyme&quot; and guest appearances on television series such as &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot; and &quot;The Young Riders&quot;.

==Post-acting==
In 1995, Bonsall retired from acting and moved with his mother and stepfather to Boulder, Colorado. He attended Boulder High School, graduating in 2000. 

He became a musician, forming the rock band Late Bloomers with his friends in 1998. He has been in the Boulder-based punk bands Thruster and The Light on Adam&#x27;s Stereo.

In 2016, Bonsall became a member and toured with rock band The Ataris. That same year, he claimed to have been clean and sober since his 2010 arrest: &quot;My drunken run-ins with the law are about 10 years behind me, so I’m pretty happy about that. I’m not proud of my past mistakes but you live and you learn&quot;.

In October 2017, Bonsall married Courtney Tuck. Their son, Oliver, was born in August of 2019. Bonsall is currently a member of the band Sunset Silhouette.

===Legal issues===
On March 28, 2007, Bonsall was arrested on charges of assaulting his partner. He was sentenced to two years of probation on August 31, 2007. 

On December 7, 2009, Bonsall was arrested for third degree assault and failure to appear in connection with the 2007 assault on his girlfriend.

In February 2010, Bonsall was arrested on charges of using marijuana in violation of the terms of his release. He was sentenced in April 2010 to two years of probation.

<doc id="1097407" wikidata="Q2680291" url="?curid=1097407" title="Residential college">
<text>A residential college is a division of a university that places academic activity in a community setting of students and faculty, usually at a residence and with shared meals, the college having a degree of autonomy and a federated relationship with the overall university. The term &quot;residential college&quot; is also used to describe a variety of other patterns, ranging from a dormitory with some academic programming, to continuing education programs for adults lasting a few days. In some parts of the world it simply refers to any organized on-campus housing, an example being University of Malaya.

==Various models==

A prominent model for residential colleges is the Oxbridge model at the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge, where the colleges are legally independent constituents of the universities that are both residential and teaching institutions. This model was modified at Durham University, also in the UK, in the 19th century to create non-teaching colleges that were, in general, legally part of the university, but with a few independent colleges added in the 20th century. With the arrival of residential colleges in the United States the model diversified further. The Durham adaptation of colleges being owned by the university rather than being independent corporations is generally followed and many universities, including Yale and Harvard, also follow Durham in keeping teaching centralised.

There is also a split between fully collegiate universities (e.g. the University of Notre Dame, where all freshmen are put in one of the 31 residential colleges) and those (e.g. Northwestern University) where not all students are members of colleges. Another variant at some US universities is residential colleges that do not cover all years at the institute, e.g. Princeton University&#x27;s system of mandatory residency the first two years, with an option to move outside one&#x27;s residential college as an upperclassman, or Cornell University&#x27;s West Campus House System, which only takes sophomores and above, with most upperclass students either living off campus or in dorms unaffiliated with the residential colleges. Another point of variance is whether colleges are multi-disciplinary (as at Oxford and Cambridge) or focused on certain subject areas such as at Fordham University, which has dedicated residential colleges (Integrated Learning Communities) for upperclass students for various themes including global business and science, as well as separate first year residential colleges, including one for students considering pre-med or science majors.

The primary difference between a residential college and a dormitory is often considered to be that while a student lives in a dormitory for a year, they are a member of a college for their entire student life, even when not living in the dormitories associated with that college: &quot;Residential colleges are collegia in the original sense: societies, not buildings, and their members may reside anywhere&quot;. However, as can be seen above, this is not common to all variants of the residential college system. In addition, the members of a residential college are usually expected to eat their meals together, as a unified body. Standard dormitories tend to have residents who move between dorm complexes every year, and who eat in dining halls largely mixed with residents of other dormitories. However, residential colleges can be self-catering (e.g. Josephine Butler College, Durham), yet still clearly identified as colleges.

==United States== 
In the United States, as in many collegiate universities in the UK, the academic and residential functions of the residential college system are normally separated, with the colleges primarily as residential and social units. Although residential colleges in some universities offer some classes, these offerings supplement the offerings of the major academic which have separate facilities. Other US institutions not mentioned above that have residential colleges include Binghamton University,Furman University, Murray State University, Rice University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Miami, Central Michigan University, Southern Methodist University, the University of Oklahoma, the University of California, San Diego, and the University of California, Santa Cruz. Many other institutions use the system as well. At the University of Virginia, students may apply to live in one of three residential colleges; acceptance rates vary widely. In 2001 Vanderbilt University decided to convert to a residential college system. Since that time, Vanderbilt has built and renovated residential facilities to suit this program, including The Commons for first-year students and several colleges for upper class students. At UC Santa Cruz and San Diego, all majors are available to students of any college, but each college has its own curricular requirements, especially with regard to general education.

==United Kingdom and Ireland==

Collegiate structures in the United Kingdom and Ireland follow a variety of models. In Oxford and Cambridge, a residential college combines both the residential and part of the academic aspects of the university in one location. &quot;Tutorials&quot; (Oxford) or &quot;supervisions&quot; (Cambridge) are generally given within the college, but lectures are organised by the wider university. In most universities in the UK with residential colleges – Durham (from the 19th century) along with Kent, Lancaster and York (from the 1960s) – formal teaching is carried out only in academic departments. Their colleges are primarily residential and the focus for social and sporting activities, as well as for student welfare. In these universities, the colleges are (with the exception of two early 20th century colleges at Durham) owned by their parent university; this is also the case for three of the newer colleges at Oxford, which are formally &quot;societies&quot; of the university. The University of Roehampton has four colleges (all founded in the 19th century) that joined to form the university. The teaching of the university takes place within the colleges, with academic departments being associated with a particular college. Roehampton colleges are, therefore, both residential and academic, but with the academic organisation on very different lines from Oxford and Cambridge. The University of London and the University of the Highlands and Islands are federal universities whose colleges are independent teaching institutes (some, in the case of London, being universities in their own right) rather than residential colleges. The University of the Arts London is similarly organised, with six constituent teaching colleges, except that these are all owned by the central university rather than being joined in a federal structure.

The University of Dublin (founded 1592) in Ireland has only one constituent college, Trinity College Dublin, which is thus effectively the whole university rather than a residential college. The University of St Andrews in Scotland contains three colleges, but these have neither a teaching nor residential role.

==Canada==
Many universities in Canada have collegiate systems similar to those in British collegiate universities. For instance, the University of Toronto and York University have a well-established collegiate system including a number of &quot;federated colleges&quot; and &quot;constituent colleges&quot;. Initially, the University of Victoria maintained a system of residential colleges (including Craigdarroch College and Lansdowne College) built around central courtyards, before adopting a more centralized residential system which is now made up of Permanent Halls (e.g., Ring Road Hall) and Common Rooms. Other Canadian universities with residential colleges include the University of Waterloo, the University of Western Ontario, the University of Manitoba, the University of British Columbia, Trent University and its colleges, Paton College at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Three Canadian residential colleges are distinguished by being for graduate students rather than undergraduates — Green College, Vancouver and St. John&#x27;s College, Vancouver colleges at UBC, and Massey College, Toronto at the University of Toronto.

==Australia==
In Australia, colleges perform different functions at different universities. Colleges at the University of Melbourne, University of Sydney, University of Queensland, University of Adelaide, University of Tasmania and the University of Western Australia provide academic, sporting and cultural programs in addition to those offered by their parent institution and each individual college has its own personality, history and traditions. However, they only serve a small fraction of the university population. By point of comparison, the colleges at the Australian National University provide a mix of the above and a singular focus on the provision of accommodation and Monash University provides a college experience, but mostly without any academic support, the exception is the affiliated Mannix College.

St Catherine&#x27;s College in Western Australia is the first residential college in Australia to have a campus at two universities - the University of Western Australia and Curtin University.

==New Zealand== 
Residential colleges or Halls of Residence in New Zealand are common across the country&#x27;s universities, particular for housing first year students. University of Auckland has 6 &quot;Halls&quot;, while University of Otago in Dunedin has a particular strong set of colleges modelled on the Oxbridge system. Each of Otago&#x27;s 15 colleges has its own distinctive &#x27;personality&#x27;, history, and traditions.

==Italy==

In Italy, the residential college model was adopted in 2003 by all of Milan universities, according to a joint program developed in collaboration with several private and public institutions, such as Microsoft and the Lombardy Region, at the Collegio di Milano.

==South Korea==
In South Korea, the residential college system was first adopted by MIRAE campus of Yonsei University in 2007 and later extended to Songdo campus in 2013. Due to the lack of housing available to the students, only the freshmen year participate in the residential college. MIRAE campus operates 7 houses and the residential college campus in Songdo operates 12 houses.

There is another residential college in GIST(Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology) College at Gwangju, South Korea. GIST College has gained positive outcomes in undergraduate students&#x27; dormitory life as well as university life as a whole.

<text>Canonical Ltd. is a privately held computer software company based in London, England. It was founded and funded by South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth to market commercial support and related services for Ubuntu and related projects. Canonical employs staff in more than 70 countries and maintains offices in London, Austin, Boston, Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei, Tokyo and the Isle of Man.

==Projects==
Canonical Ltd. has created and continues to back several projects. Principally these are free and open-source software (FOSS) or tools designed to improve collaboration between free software developers and contributors. Some projects require a Contributor License Agreement to be signed.

===Open-source software===

* Ubuntu, a Debian-based Linux distribution with GNOME (formerly with Unity) desktop
** Ubuntu Core, a tiny and transactional version of Ubuntu
* GNU Bazaar, a decentralized revision control system
* Storm, an object-relational mapper for Python, part of the Launchpad code base
* Juju, a service orchestration management tool
* MAAS, a bare-metal server provisioning tool
* cloud-init, the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for the initial setup of virtual machines in the cloud
* U1DB, a cross-platform, cross-device, and syncable database application programming interface (API), allowing for applications to store JSON documents and synchronize them between machines and devices
* Upstart, a discontinued event-based replacement for the init daemon
* Quickly, a framework for creating software programs for Linux
* Ubiquity and Subiquity, operating system installers for Ubuntu
* Mir, a computer display server
* MicroK8s, an implementation of Kubernetes (since December 2018)
* Snap, a package management system for Ubuntu and other Linux operating systems
** Snapcraft, a Python-based tool for packaging software
* Launchpad, a centralised website containing several component web applications designed to make collaboration between free software projects easier:
** PPA, a special software repository for uploading software packages to be built and published as an APT repository,
** Blueprints, a tool for planning features of software,
** Code, a hosting of Bazaar branches,
** Answers, a support tracker,
** Rosetta, an online language translation tool to help localisation of software (cf. the Rosetta Stone),
** Malone (as in &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;), a collaborative bug-tracker that allows linking to other bug-trackers,
** Soyuz, a tool for creating custom-distributions, such as Kubuntu and Xubuntu.

===Other projects and services===
* Landscape, a proprietary web service for centralized management of Ubuntu Linux systems
* Ubuntu One, a discontinued service since 2014 for file synchronization and other uses
* Ubuntu Advantage, a commercial support service that covers Ubuntu and other Canonical products
* Multipass, launched in 2019, provides a command line interface to launch and manage virtual machine instances of Linux in Windows, macOS and Linux.

===Joint ventures===
* Windows Subsystem for Linux, with Microsoft

==Business plans==
In 2007, Canonical launched an International online shop selling support services and Ubuntu-branded goods; later in 2008 it expanded that with a United States-specific shop designed to reduce shipment times. At the same time, the word &quot;Ubuntu&quot; was trademarked in connection with clothing and accessories.

In a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview in May 2008, Shuttleworth said that Canonical&#x27;s business model was service provision and that Canonical was not yet close to profitability. Canonical stated that it would wait three to five years to become profitable. Shuttleworth regarded Canonical as positioning itself as demand for services related to free software rose. This strategy has been compared to Red Hat&#x27;s business strategies in the 1990s. In an early-2009 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Shuttleworth said that Canonical&#x27;s revenue was &quot;creeping&quot; towards , the company&#x27;s break-even point.

Canonical achieved a small operating profit of $281,000 in 2009, but until 2017 struggled to maintain financial solvency and took a major financial hit from the development of Unity and Ubuntu Touch, leading to an operating loss of $21.6 million for the fiscal year 2013. The company reported an operating profit of $2 million in 2017 after shutting down the Unity development team and laying off nearly 200 employees. The company now plans to focus on its server and professional support solutions, which have proved to be most profitable. Through this, Canonical plans to maintain solvency and achieve long-term profitability. In 2022, Ubuntu made a profit of £0.52m on revenues of £14.31m. 

Canonical reported a revenue of $175M in 2021. 

==Subsidiaries==
* Canonical Group Ltd is located in London.
* Canonical USA Inc. is located in Boston, Massachusetts and Austin, Texas.
* Canonical China Ltd () is located in Shanghai and Beijing.
* Canonical Ltd Taiwan Branch () is located in Taipei.
* Canonical Limited is located in Isle of Man and Tokyo (Japan).
* Canonical Brasil Ltd is located in São Paulo (this office is no longer listed on their website).
* Canonical Canada Ltd is located in Montreal (the office is no longer in service).

==Employees==

Canonical has more than 1200 employees. The head office is in London on the 5th Floor of the Blue Fin Building, Southwark Street, having previously moved from the 27th floor of Millbank Tower. In the summer of 2006, Canonical opened an office in Montreal to house its global support and services operation. Taipei 101 is also home to a Canonical office. There was formerly an OEM team in Lexington, Massachusetts, United States.

<doc id="1097424" wikidata="Q589850" url="?curid=1097424" title="Sterno">
<text>Sterno is a brand of jellied denatured alcohol sold in and meant to be burned directly in its can. Popular both in commercial food service and home entertainment, its primary uses are as a fuel for heating chafing dishes in buffets and serving fondue. Other uses are for portable stoves and as an emergency heat source. It is also used with toy and model steam and other external combustion engines.

The flame is typically lit with a match or lighter and extinguished by placing the lid over the can to starve it of air, though any noncombustible cover will do.

== History ==
The Sterno brand and trademark is owned by Sterno Products, a portfolio company of Westar Capital LLC, based in Corona, California. The brand was purchased from Blyth, Inc. in late 2012. Blyth had acquired the business from Colgate-Palmolive in 1997.

The name comes from that of the original manufacturer, S. Sternau &amp; Co. of Brooklyn, New York, a maker of chafing dishes, coffee percolators and similar appliances since 1893. It had previously applied the name to its &quot;Sterno-Inferno&quot; alcohol burner. In 1918, it promoted its Sterno Stove as being a perfect gift for a soldier going overseas. In his book &quot;With the Old Breed&quot;, E. B. Sledge describes its use on the battlefields of the Pacific Theatre in 1944 and 1945.

Discovered around 1900 as a byproduct of the nitrocellulose manufacturing process, Sterno is made from ethanol denatured by adding methanol, water, and an amphoteric oxide gelling agent, plus, in recent decades, a safety dye that gives it a characteristic pink color. The methanol is added to denature the product, which is intended to make it too toxic for consumption. Designed to be odorless, a can will burn for up to two hours.

== Abuse ==
Sterno contains methyl alcohol which makes it poisonous. In spite of this there are many instances of people drinking Sterno to become intoxicated as a form of surrogate alcohol. 

Moreover, the methanol can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerves. Bluesman Tommy Johnson alludes to the practice in his song &quot;Canned Heat Blues&quot; recorded in 1928. (The blues band Canned Heat derived their name from the song.)

The practice is said to have become popular during Prohibition and during the Great Depression in hobo camps, or &quot;jungles&quot;, when the Sterno would be squeezed through cheesecloth or a sock and the resulting liquid mixed with fruit juice to make &quot;jungle juice&quot;, &quot;sock wine&quot;, or &quot;squeeze&quot;.

The 1956 American documentary &quot;On the Bowery&quot; includes footage of three homeless men straining Sterno cooking fuel to make &quot;squeeze&quot; and then drinking the alcohol.

In an article for the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; in 1961, Capt. James H. Shinaberger, MC, writes about a study of three people who had suffered methanol poisoning as a result of drinking Sterno. One of the patients &quot;had been drinking Sterno for about a week and had been in the city prison for 48 hours when severe abdominal pain and vomiting occurred&quot;.

In December 1963, a rash of 31 deaths in Philadelphia&#x27;s homeless population was traced to a local store that knowingly sold Sterno to people for them to consume and get drunk.

<text>Wallace Amos Jr. (July 1, 1936 – August 13, 2024) was an American television personality, businessman, and author. He was the founder of the Famous Amos chocolate chip cookie, the Cookie Kahuna, and Aunt Della&#x27;s Cookies gourmet cookie brands, and was the host of the adult reading program &quot;Learn to Read&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Amos was born July 1, 1936, to Wallace and Ruby Amos. He was born and raised in Tallahassee, Florida, until he was 12 years old. When his parents divorced, he moved to New York City with his aunt, where he enrolled at the Food Trades Vocational High School. He showed his interest in cooking at a young age. It was from his aunt Della Bryant, who would bake cookies for him, that Amos later developed his chocolate chip cookie recipe. Amos dropped out of high school to join the United States Air Force.

He served at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu, Hawaii, from 1954 until 1957. He earned his high school equivalency diploma before being honorably discharged from the military.

== Career ==
Returning to New York City, Amos took classes to become a secretary and took a mailroom clerk job with the William Morris Agency. Eventually, he became the agency&#x27;s first African American talent agent. He signed Simon &amp; Garfunkel and headed the agency&#x27;s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll department. Amos attracted clients by sending them chocolate chip cookies along with an invitation to visit him. The musicians he represented included The Temptations and Marvin Gaye.

In 1975, a friend suggested to Amos that he set up a store to sell his cookies. In March of that year, the first Famous Amos cookie store opened in Los Angeles, California. He started the business with the help of a $25,000 loan from Marvin Gaye and Helen Reddy. The company began to expand, and eventually, Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies could be found on supermarket shelves across the United States. He became such a known figure culturally that he appeared as himself in the &quot;Taxi&quot; episode &quot;Latka&#x27;s Cookies&quot;, in 1981. Thanks in part to the success of his cookie company, he was hired to deliver speeches. He wrote several books, many of which have a self-help theme, including &quot;The Cookie Never Crumbles&quot; and &quot;The Power in You&quot;.

In 1979, Amos&#x27;s long-time friend and publicist John Rosica introduced him to Literacy Volunteers of America. Amos advocated literacy and helped thousands of adults learn to read. In 1987, he also hosted a television series designed to teach others how to read, entitled &quot;Learn to Read&quot;, produced by Kentucky Educational Television and WXYZ-TV.

In 1986, Amos was awarded the Entrepreneurial Excellence Award by President Ronald Reagan at the White House Conference on Small Business.

Due to financial troubles, Amos was forced to sell the Famous Amos Company in 1988. Because the name &quot;Famous Amos&quot; was trademarked by his former company, he had to use Uncle Noname&#x27;s Cookie Company as his new company&#x27;s name. A Famous Amos distributor at the time, Lou Avignone, heard Amos on a local radio talk show and contacted Amos with the idea for starting a new business. In 1994, the two became partners and subsequently launched Uncle Noname Gourmet Muffins. The company focused on fat-free, nutritious muffins. Uncle Noname became Uncle Wally&#x27;s Muffin Company in 1999. The muffins were sold in more than 3,500 stores nationwide.

In 2014, an article in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine lauded &quot;The cookie comeback of &#x27;Famous&#x27; Wally Amos&quot; as Amos brought back his handmade cookies under a new name, The Cookie Kahuna. These cookies were marketed in a store in Hawaii, where Amos was based. They come in the flavors original chocolate chip, chocolate chip with pecans, and butterscotch with macadamia nuts. Amos appeared on the reality television show &quot;Shark Tank&quot; in October 2016, pitching Cookie Kahuna, but failed to get a deal. The business folded in 2018.

In 2019, Amos was called &quot;the king of cookies&quot; by NBC affiliate KSNV in Las Vegas.

In 2020, Content Media Group released a documentary on the life of Wally Amos, &quot;The Great Cookie Comeback: reBaking Wally Amos&quot;. The film was directed by Jeff MacIntyre.

== Personal life ==

Amos was married four times, most recently to Carol Williams. He had four children: Michael Amos, Gregory Amos, Sarah Amos, and musician Shawn Amos. Amos lived in Hawaii from 1977 until 2018, and was again living in the state at the time of his death. He also lived in Columbia, South Carolina, where he was working on Aunt Della&#x27;s Cookies until 2018.

Amos died due to complications from dementia at his home in Honolulu on August 13, 2024, at the age of 88.

<doc id="1097430" wikidata="Q606357" url="?curid=1097430" title="Cessnock, New South Wales">
<text>Cessnock () is a city in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia, about by road west of Newcastle. It is the administrative centre of the City of Cessnock LGA and was named after an 1826 grant of land called Cessnock Estate, which was owned by John Campbell. The local area was once known as &quot;The Coalfields&quot;, and it is the gateway city to the vineyards of the Hunter Valley, which includes Pokolbin, Mount View, Lovedale, Broke, Rothbury, and Branxton.

==History==
The Wonnarua people are the traditional owners of the Cessnock area. Many were killed or died as a result of European diseases after colonisation. Others were forced onto neighbouring tribal territory and killed. The city of Cessnock features many Indigenous place names including Congewai, Kurri Kurri, Laguna, Nulkaba and Wollombi.

Lying between Australia&#x27;s earliest European settlements – Sydney, the Hawkesbury River and Newcastle, pastoralists commenced settlement of the land in the 1820s. Cessnock was named by Scottish settler John Campbell, after his grandfather&#x27;s baronial Cessnock Castle in Galston, East Ayrshire, to reflect the aristocratic heritage and ambitions for this estate. The township of Cessnock developed from 1850, as a service centre at the junction of the Great North Road from Sydney to the Hunter Valley, with branches to Maitland and Singleton.

The establishment of the South Maitland coalfields generated extensive land settlement between 1903 and 1923. The current pattern of urban development, transport routes and industrial landscape was laid at this time. The surveying of the Greta coal seam by Professor Edgeworth David around 1888 became the impetus for considerable social and economic change in the area with the development of the coal mining industry.

==Demographics==

According to the 2021 census, there were 63,632 people in the Cessnock LGA.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 10.2% of the population.
* 87.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.9%, New Zealand 1.0% and Philippines 0.5%.
* 90.1% of people spoke only English at home.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 41.1%, Anglican 19.2% and Catholic 17.7%.

==Economy==

The decline of mining on the South Maitland Coalfields has been paralleled by growth in the wine industry and better access to other employment centres.

The Hunter Valley wine-growing area near Cessnock is Australia&#x27;s oldest wine region and one of the most famous, with around under vine. The vineyards of Pokolbin, Mount View and Allandale, with their rich volcanic soils tended by entrepreneurial vignerons, are also the focus of a thriving and growing tourism industry. The extension and eventual completion of the F3 Freeway, created a property and tourism boom during the 1990s.

Cessnock has begun to develop other tourist ventures beyond the wine industry such as championship golf courses, hot air ballooning, sky-diving, and guest house accommodation.

The city council has actively pursued a policy of urban renewal in the city centre since 2001. The local council was one of the first to introduce a recycling program for waste disposal in the state. 

Most employment comes from the local port city of Newcastle, the nearby major centres of Maitland and Singleton and in service industries in the local council area, which comprises many small towns, such as Kurri Kurri, Weston, Neath, Abernethy, Kearsley and Pokolbin.

==Geography==
The town is located in the rich alluvial and volcanic soils of the Hunter Valley. Rich coal seams underlie much of the area. The Brokenback Range (part of the Great Dividing Range) rises to the west of the city. The Hunter River flows down the Hunter Valley approximately to the north. Cessnock lies within the Hunter Valley Important Bird Area.

===Climate===
Cessnock has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters, similar to Penrith, a suburb in Greater Western Sydney to the south. Summers may be dry due to their inland location, but humid days are not uncommon. Winters are usually dry with cold nights, which may be frosty.

==Sport==

The city has many sporting facilities. The city competes in several regional sporting competitions, particularly the Cessnock Goannas competing in Newcastle-based rugby league competition. Some very successful sporting players can trace their roots to the local district, including Australian Rugby League representative players and brothers Andrew and Matthew Johns. World-renowned golfer and TV commentator Jack Newton is also from Cessnock. His annual Sub-Juniors Golf Tournament has unearthed some talented young golfers and is held on the local championship courses of Pokolbin. Cessnock was the base camp for the Japan national football team during the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

==Transport==
For a century Cessnock was served by the South Maitland Railway network, originally constructed for the coal industry, but which at one time had considerable passenger services terminating at Cessnock railway station, including a direct train to Sydney known as the &quot;Cessnock Flyer&quot;.

The Sydney–Newcastle Freeway&#x27;s Cessnock exit at Freemans Waterhole provides one of the main road connections from Sydney to Cessnock via The Gap, a pass through the Watagan Mountains range just north of Mount Heaton.

Until the Hunter Expressway opened in 2014, linking the New England Highway at Branxton and the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway at West Wallsend, through traffic passed through Cessnock.

The local airport is placed just to the north of the city, at the entrance to the Vineyard District. It has a small public passenger terminal and also serves as the base for aviation training organisations such as Avondale College&#x27;s school of Aviation and Hunter Valley Aviation. The airport is not served by RPT flights. Access by air to the region is by Newcastle Airport at Williamtown, away.

The local bus service is run by Rover Coaches which provide services to Maitland, Newcastle and Morisset and school bus services.

<text>Rio Tinto Group is a British-Australian multinational company that is the world&#x27;s second largest metals and mining corporation (behind BHP). It was founded in 1873 when a group of investors purchased a mine complex on the Rio Tinto, in Huelva, Spain, from the Spanish government. It has grown through a long series of mergers and acquisitions. Although primarily focused on extraction of minerals, it also has significant operations in refining, particularly the refining of bauxite and iron ore. It has joint head offices in London, England and Melbourne, Australia.

Rio Tinto is a dual-listed company traded on both the London Stock Exchange, where it is a component of the FTSE 100 Index, and the Australian Securities Exchange, where it is a component of the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index. American depositary shares of Rio Tinto&#x27;s British branch are also traded on the New York Stock Exchange, giving it listings on three major stock exchanges. In the 2020 &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000, it was ranked the world&#x27;s 114th-largest public company.

Rio Tinto has faced widely criticism by environmental groups as well as the government of Norway for the environmental impacts of its mining activities.

==Formation==
Since antiquity, a site along the Rio Tinto in Huelva, Spain, has been mined for copper, silver, gold and other minerals. Around 3000 BC, Iberians and Tartessians began mining the site, followed by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Visigoths and Moors. After a period of abandonment, the mines were rediscovered in 1556 and the Spanish government began operating them once again in 1724.

However, Spain&#x27;s mining operations there were inefficient, and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises, leading the government to sell the mines in 1873 at a price later determined to be well below actual value. The purchasers of the mine were led by Hugh Matheson&#x27;s Matheson &amp; Company, which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of Deutsche Bank (56% ownership), Matheson (24%) and the civil engineering firm Clark, Punchard and Company (20%). At an auction held by the Spanish government to sell the mine on 14 February 1873, the group won with a bid of £3.68 million (ESP 92.8 million). The bid also specified that Spain would permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mine&#x27;s production. Following purchase of the mine, the syndicate launched the Rio Tinto Company, registering it on 29 March 1873. At the end of the 1880s, control of the firm passed to the Rothschild family, who increased the scale of its mining operations.

==Operating history==

Following their purchase of the Rio Tinto Mine, the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities, innovated new mining techniques, and expanded mining activities.

From 1877 to 1891, the Rio Tinto Mine was the world&#x27;s leading producer of copper.
 From 1870 through 1925, the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the Rio Tinto Mine, with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of Spain. The company enjoyed strong financial success until 1914, colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices. However, World War I and its aftermath effectively eliminated the United States as a viable market for European pyrites, leading to a decline in the firm&#x27;s prominence.
The company&#x27;s failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms. However, this changed in 1925, when Sir Auckland Geddes succeeded Lord Alfred Milner as chairman. Geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the company&#x27;s investment strategy and the introduction of organisational and marketing reforms. Geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies, as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of Spain. Between 1925 and 1931, Geddes recruited two directors: JN Buchanan (finance director) and RM Preston (commercial director), as well as other executives involved with technical and other matters.

Perhaps most significant was the company&#x27;s investment in copper mines in Northern Rhodesia, later Zambia, which it eventually consolidated into the Rhokana Corporation. These and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the Rio Tinto mine in Spain. By the 1950s, Franco&#x27;s nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit Spanish resources for the profit of foreigners. Rio Tinto Company, supported by its international investments, was able to divest two-thirds of its Spanish operations in 1954 and the remainder over the following years.

The company was part of the uranium producers&#x27; cartel, Societe d&#x27;Etudes de Recherches d&#x27;Uranium, which operated from 1972 to 1976. The other cartel members were based in Australia, France, and South Africa. It was formed by the major non-United States uranium producers to mitigate the impacts of US policy on the uranium market; to do so, the cartel engaged in bid rigging, price fixing, and market sharing. Westinghouse filed an antitrust lawsuit against cartel members in 1976 and the cartel disbanded.

==Major mergers and acquisitions==
Like many major mining companies, Rio Tinto has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions.

===Early acquisitions===
The company&#x27;s first major acquisition occurred in 1929, when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising 2.5 million pounds to invest in Northern Rhodesian copper mining companies, which was fully invested by the end of 1930. The Rio Tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the Rhokana Corporation by forcing the various companies to merge.

Rio Tinto&#x27;s investment in Rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its Spanish Rio Tinto operations spanning the Spanish Civil War, World War II and Franco&#x27;s nationalistic policies. In the 1950s, the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly British and French owners to extract profits from Spanish operations, and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name. Thus, in 1954, Rio Tinto Company sold two-thirds of its stake in the Rio Tinto mines, disposing of the rest over the following years. The sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade.

===Merger with Consolidated Zinc===
The company&#x27;s exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities, but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities. This situation precipitated the next, and perhaps most significant, merger in the company&#x27;s history. In 1962, Rio Tinto Company merged with the Australian firm Consolidated Zinc to form the Rio Tinto – Zinc Corporation (RTZ) and its main subsidiary, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia (CRA). The merger provided Rio Tinto the ability to exploit its new-found opportunities, and gave Consolidated Zinc a much larger asset base.

RTZ and CRA were separately managed and operated, with CRA focusing on opportunities within Australasia and RTZ taking the rest of the world. However, the companies continued to trade separately, and RTZ&#x27;s ownership of CRA dipped below 50% by 1986. The two companies&#x27; strategic needs eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities, and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest. In 1995, the companies merged into a dual listed company, in which management was consolidated into a single entity and shareholder interests were aligned and equivalent, although maintained as shares in separately named entities. The merger also precipitated a name change; after two years as RTZ-CRA, RTZ became Rio Tinto plc and CRA became Rio Tinto Limited, referred to collectively as Rio Tinto.

===Recent mergers, acquisitions and events===
Major acquisitions following the Consolidated Zinc merger included US Borax, a major producer of borax, bought in 1968, Kennecott Utah Copper and BP&#x27;s coal assets which were bought from BP in 1989, and a 70.7% interest in the New South Wales operations of Coal &amp; Allied, also in 1989. In 1993, the company acquired Nerco and the United States coal mining businesses of Cordero Mining Company.

In 2000, Rio Tinto acquired North Limited, an Australian company with iron ore and uranium mines, for $2.8 billion. The takeover was partially motivated as a response to North Limited&#x27;s 1999 bid to have Rio Tinto&#x27;s Pilbara railway network declared open access. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission regulatory body approved the acquisition in August 2000, and the purchase was completed in October of the same year. That year, Rio Tinto also bought North Limited and Ashton Mining for US$4 billion, adding additional resources in aluminium, iron ore, diamonds and coal. In 2001, it bought (under Coal &amp; Allied) the Australian coal businesses of the Peabody Energy.

On 14 November 2007, Rio Tinto completed its largest acquisition to date, purchasing Canadian aluminium company Alcan for $38.1 billion, , &quot;the largest mining deal ever completed&quot;. Alcan&#x27;s chief executive, Jacynthe Côté, led the new division, renamed Rio Tinto Alcan with its headquarters situated in Montreal.

Activity in 2008 and 2009 was focused on divestments of assets to raise cash and refocus on core business opportunities. The company sold three major assets in 2008, raising about $3 billion in cash. In the first quarter of 2009, Rio Tinto reached agreements to sell its interests in the Corumbá iron ore mine and the Jacobs Ranch coal mine, and completed sales of an aluminium smelter in China and the company&#x27;s potash operations, for an additional estimated $2.5 billion.
On 5 July 2009, four Rio Tinto employees were arrested in Shanghai for corruption and espionage. One of the arrested, Australian citizen Stern Hu, was &quot;suspected of stealing Chinese state secrets for foreign countries and was detained on criminal charges&quot;, according to a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry. Stern Hu was also accused of bribery by Chinese steel mill executives for sensitive information during the iron ore contract negotiations.

On 19 March 2010 Rio Tinto and its biggest shareholder, Chinalco, signed a memorandum of understanding to develop Rio Tinto&#x27;s iron ore project in the Simandou mine in Simandou, Guinea. On 29 July 2010, Rio Tinto and Chinalco signed a binding agreement to establish this joint venture covering the development and operation of the Simandou mine.

Under the terms of the agreement, the joint venture maintains Rio Tinto&#x27;s 95% interest in the Simandou project as follows: By providing US$1.35 billion on an earn-in basis through sole funding of ongoing development over a two-to-three-year period, Chalco, a subsidiary of Chinalco, would acquire a 47% interest in the joint venture. Once the full sum was paid, Rio Tinto would be left with a 50.35% interest in the project and Chalco would have 44.65%. The remaining 5% would be owned by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the financing arm of the World Bank. On 22 April 2011 Rio Tinto, its subsidiary Simfer S.A. (Simfer), and the Guinean Government signed a settlement agreement that secured Rio Tinto&#x27;s mining rights in Guinea to the southern concession of Simandou, known as blocks 3 and 4. According to the agreement, Simfer would pay US$700 million and receive mining concession and government approval of the proposed Chalco and Rio Tinto Simandou joint venture.

In April 2011, Rio Tinto gained a majority stake in Riversdale Mining.

In 2011, the company rekindled its interest in potash when it entered a joint venture with Acron Group to develop the Albany potash development, in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Following an exploration program, Acron in a June 2014 statement described Albany as &quot;one of the best potash development opportunities in the world&quot;.

On 13 December 2011, an independent arbitrator cleared the way for Rio Tinto, which had owned 49% of Ivanhoe Mines (now known as Turquoise Hill Resources), to take it over: he said the $16 billion Canadian group&#x27;s &quot;poison pill&quot; defence was not valid. Ivanhoe had developed Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, one of the world&#x27;s largest-known copper deposits. On 28 January 2012, Rio Tinto gained control of Ivanhoe Mines and removed the management.

In October 2013, Rio Tinto agreed to sell its majority stake in Australia&#x27;s third-largest coal mine to Glencore and Sumitomo for a little over US$1 billion, as part of the firm&#x27;s plans to focus on larger operations. Less than a year later, Rio Tinto rejected two merger proposals from Glencore, proffered in July and August 2014; the merger of Glencore and Rio Tinto would have created the world&#x27;s largest mining company.

In May 2015, Rio Tinto announced plans to sell some of its aluminium assets as part of a possible $1 billion deal, two years after a similar but failed attempt.

In September 2020, it was announced that the company&#x27;s chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, along with two executives, would resign because of Rio Tinto&#x27;s destruction of two ancient rock shelters in the Pilbara region of Australia. The company&#x27;s chief financial officer, Jakob Stausholm, became the new chief executive on 1 January 2021.

In March 2022, Rio Tinto completed the acquisition of Rincon Mining&#x27;s lithium project in Argentina for $825 million, following approval by Australia&#x27;s Foreign Investment Review Board.

In July 2023, it was announced Rio Tinto had acquired a 15% stake in the Australian exploration and development company, Sovereign Metals for US $27.6 million.

== Subsidiaries ==
The company has operations on six continents, but is mainly concentrated in Australia and Canada, and owns its mining operations through a complex web of wholly and partly owned subsidiaries.

*Energy Resources of Australia – 68.4%
*Hathor Exploration – 100%
*QIT-Fer et Titane – 100%
*Dampier Salt – 68.4%
*Iron Ore Company of Canada – 58.7%
*Pacific Aluminum – 100%
*Richards Bay Minerals – 74%

==Corporate status==
Rio Tinto is primarily organised into four operational businesses, divided by product type:

* Iron ore
* Aluminium – aluminium, bauxite and alumina
* Copper &amp; Diamonds – copper and by-products such as gold, silver, molybdenum and sulphuric acid, and the company&#x27;s diamond interests
* Energy &amp; Minerals – uranium interests, industrial minerals such as borax, salt and titanium dioxide. The corporation previously held coal production assets.

These operating groups are supported by separate divisions providing exploration and function support.

===Stock structure and ownership===
Rio Tinto is structured as a dual-listed company, with listings on both the London Stock Exchange (symbol: RIO), under the name &quot;Rio Tinto Plc&quot;, and the Australian Securities Exchange (symbol: RIO) in Sydney, under the name &quot;Rio Tinto Limited&quot;. The dual-listed company structure grants shareholders of the two companies the same proportional economic interests and ownership rights in the consolidated Rio Tinto, in such a way as to be equivalent to all shareholders of the two companies actually being shareholders in a single, unified entity. This structure was implemented to avoid adverse tax consequences and regulatory burdens. To eliminate currency exchange issues, the company&#x27;s accounts are kept, and dividends paid, in United States dollars.

Rio Tinto is one of the largest companies listed on either exchange. As such, it is included in the widely quoted indices for each market: the FTSE 100 Index of the London Stock Exchange, and the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index of the Australian Securities Exchange. LSE-listed shares in Rio Tinto plc can also be traded indirectly on the New York Stock Exchange via an American Depositary Receipt. As of 4 March 2009, Rio Tinto was the fourth-largest publicly listed mining company in the world, with a market capitalisation around $134 billion. As of mid-February 2009, shareholders were geographically distributed 42% in the United Kingdom, 18% in North America, 16% in Australia, 14% in Asia and 10% in continental Europe.

====BHP Billiton bid====
On 8 November 2007, rival mining company BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase Rio Tinto in an all-share deal. This offer was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto as &quot;significantly undervalu[ing]&quot; the company. Another attempt by BHP Billiton for a hostile takeover, valuing Rio Tinto at $147 billion, was rejected on the same grounds. Meanwhile, the Chinese government-owned resources group Chinalco and the US aluminium producer Alcoa purchased 12% of Rio Tinto&#x27;s London-listed shares in a move that would block or severely complicate BHP Billiton&#x27;s plans to buy the company. BHP Billiton&#x27;s bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008, with the BHP citing market instability from the global financial crisis of 2008–2009.

====Chinalco investment====
On 1 February 2009, Rio Tinto management announced it was in talks to receive a substantial equity infusion from Chinalco, a major Chinese state-controlled mining enterprise, in exchange for ownership interest in certain assets and bonds. Chinalco was already a major shareholder, having bought up 9% of the company in a surprise move in early 2008; its ownership stake had risen to 9.8% by 2014, making it Rio Tinto&#x27;s biggest investor. The proposed investment structure reportedly involves $12.3 billion for the purchase of ownership interests of Rio Tinto assets in its iron ore, copper and aluminium operations, plus $7.2 billion for convertible bonds. The transaction would bring Chinalco&#x27;s ownership of the company to roughly 18.5%. The deal is still pending approval from regulators in the United States and China, and has not yet been approved by shareholders, although regulatory approval has been received from Germany and the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission. The largest barrier to completing the investment may come from Rio Tinto&#x27;s shareholders; support for the deal by shareholders was never overwhelming and has reportedly declined in 2009, as other financing options (such as a more traditional bond issuance) are beginning to appear more realistic as a viable alternative funding source. A shareholder vote on the proposed deal was expected in the third quarter of 2009.

Rio Tinto is believed to have pursued this combined asset and convertible bond sale to raise cash to satisfy its debt obligations, which required payments of $9.0 billion in October 2009 and $10.5 billion by the end of 2010. The company has also noted China&#x27;s increasing appetite for commodities, and the potential for increased opportunities to exploit these market trends, as a key factor in recommending the transaction to its shareholders.

In March 2010, it was announced that Chinalco would invest $1.3 billion for a 44.65% stake in Rio Tinto&#x27;s iron ore project in Simandou, Guinea. Rio Tinto retained 50.35% ownership at Simandou.

In November 2011, Rio joined with Chinalco to explore for copper resources in China&#x27;s complex landscape, by setting up a new company, CRTX, 51% owned by Chinalco and 49% by Rio Tinto.

===Management===

Under the company&#x27;s dual-listed company structure, management powers of the Rio Tinto are consolidated in a single senior management group led by a board of directors and executive committee. The board of directors has both executive and non-executive members, while the executive committee is composed of the heads of major operational groups.

==Operations==
Rio Tinto&#x27;s main business is the production of raw materials including copper, iron ore, bauxite, diamonds, uranium and industrial minerals including titanium dioxide, salt, gypsum and borates. Rio Tinto also performs processing on some of these materials, with plants dedicated to processing bauxite into alumina and aluminium, and smelting iron ore into iron. The company also produces other metals and minerals as by-products from the processing of its main resources, including gold, silver, molybdenum, sulphuric acid, nickel, potash, lead and zinc. Rio Tinto controls gross assets of $81 billion in value across the globe, with main concentrations in Australia (35%), Canada (34%), Europe (13%) and the United States (11%), and smaller holdings in South America (3%), Africa (3%) and Indonesia (1%).

===Iron ore: Rio Tinto Iron Ore===
The Australian operations of Rio Tinto Iron Ore (RTIO) comprises an integrated iron ore operations in the Pilbara, Western Australia. The Pilbara iron ore operations include 16 iron ore mines, four independent port terminals, a 1,700-kilometre rail network and related infrastructure. The corporation also has had a majority stake in Iron Ore Company of Canada since its 2000 hostile takeover of North Limited.

===Copper and by-products: Rio Tinto Copper===
Copper was one of Rio Tinto&#x27;s main products from its earliest days operating at the Rio Tinto complex of mines in Spain. Since that time, the company has divested itself from its original Spanish mines, and grown its copper-mining capacity through acquisitions of major copper resources around the world. The copper group&#x27;s main active mining interests are Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia, Kennecott Utah Copper in the United States, and Minera Escondida in Chile. Most of these mines are joint ventures with other major mining companies, with Rio Tinto&#x27;s ownership ranging from 30% to 80%; only Kennecott is wholly owned. Operations typically include mining of ore through to production of 99.99% purified copper, including extraction of economically valuable by-products. Together, Rio Tinto&#x27;s share of copper production at its mines totalled nearly 700,000 tonnes, making the company the fourth-largest copper producer in the world.

Rio Tinto Copper continues to seek new opportunities for expansion, with major exploration activities at the Resolution Copper project in the United States, Winu in Australia, and Oyu Tolgoi underground mine in Mongolia. In addition, the company is seeking to become a major producer of nickel, with exploration projects currently underway in the United States and Indonesia.

Although not the primary focus of Rio Tinto Copper&#x27;s operations, several economically valuable by-products are produced during the refining of copper ore into purified copper. Gold, silver, molybdenum and sulphuric acid are all removed from copper ore during processing. Due to the scale of Rio Tinto&#x27;s copper mining and processing facilities, the company is also a leading producer of these materials, which drive substantial revenues to the company.

Sales of copper generated 8% of the company&#x27;s 2008 revenues, and copper and by-product operations accounted for 16% of underlying earnings.
Rio Tinto exclusively provided the metal to produce the 4,700 gold, silver and bronze medals at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This was the second time Rio Tinto had done so for Olympic medals, having previously provided the metals for the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics. Together, Rio Tinto&#x27;s share of copper production at its mines totalled nearly 700,000 tonnes, making the company the fourth-largest copper producer in the world.
Rio Tinto was the naming rights sponsor of Utah Soccer Stadium until 2022.

===Aluminium===


Rio Tinto consolidated its aluminium-related businesses into its aluminium product group (originally named &quot;Rio Tinto Alcan&quot;), formed in late 2007, when Rio Tinto purchased the Canadian company Alcan for $38.1 billion. Combined with Rio Tinto&#x27;s existing aluminium-related assets, the new aluminium division vaulted to the world number-one producer of bauxite, alumina and aluminium. Aluminium division kept key leadership from Alcan, and the company&#x27;s headquarters remain in Montreal.

Rio Tinto divides its Aluminium operations into three main areas—bauxite, alumina and primary metal. The Bauxite and Alumina unit mines raw bauxite from locations in Australia, Brazil and Africa. The unit then refines the bauxite into alumina at refineries located in Australia, Brazil, Canada and France. The Primary Metal business unit&#x27;s operations consist of smelting aluminium from alumina, with smelters located in 11 countries around the world. The Primary Metal group also operates several power plants to support the energy-intensive smelting process.

The aluminium division has interests in seven bauxite mines and deposits, six alumina refineries and six speciality alumina plants, 26 aluminium smelters, 13 power plants and 120 facilities for the manufacture of speciality products. The acquisition of Alcan operations in 2007 substantially increased Rio Tinto&#x27;s asset base, revenues and profits: in 2008, 41% of company revenues and 10% of underlying earnings were attributable to the aluminium division.

===Uranium: Rio Tinto Energy===
Rio Tinto Energy is a business group of Rio Tinto that was dedicated to the mining and sale of uranium. Rio Tinto&#x27;s uranium operations were located at two mines: the Ranger Uranium Mine of Energy Resources of Australia and the Rössing uranium mine in Namibia. The unit is now focused on mine rehabilitation. The company was the third-largest producer of uranium in the world. According to Rio Tinto&#x27;s website, the company instituted strict controls and contractual limitations on uranium exports, limiting uses to peaceful, nonexplosive uses only. Such controls are intended to limit use of the company&#x27;s uranium production to use as fuel for nuclear power plants only, and not for use in the production of nuclear weapons. Rio Tinto Energy was responsible for 12% of revenues and 18% of underlying earnings in 2008.

Rio Tinto has divested or closed its remaining uranium operations since 2019. In 2019 it sold its remaining holdings in the Rössing uranium mine to China National Uranium Corporation Limited (CNUC) for an initial cash payment of $6.5 million plus a contingent payment of up to $100 million.

Mining finished at Ranger in late 2012 and the mine plant processed stockpiled ore until January 2021. Rio has tenure and access to the site, principally for rehabilitation activities, until 8 January 2026.

===Diamonds: Rio Tinto Diamonds===

Rio Tinto Diamonds operates two diamond mines: the Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada (60% ownership) and the Murowa diamond mine located in Zimbabwe (78% ownership). Together, these two mines produce 20% of the world&#x27;s annual production of rough diamonds, making Rio Tinto the world&#x27;s third-largest producer of mined diamonds.

Rio Tinto formerly operated the Argyle Diamond Mine in Western Australia (100% ownership).

The diamond business unit&#x27;s most advanced exploration project is the Falcon Project in Saskatchewan, Canada, where Rio Tinto owns 60% of the project in a joint venture with Star Diamond Corp. Rio Tinto Diamonds generated 1% of revenues and earnings for Rio Tinto in 2008.

===Industrial minerals: Rio Tinto Minerals===
Rio Tinto Minerals is a diverse business group with mining and processing interest in borates, salt and gypsum. Rio Tinto Borax, with operations in California, supplies nearly one-third of the world&#x27;s annual demand for refined borates. The Minerals group is also majority owner of Dampier Salt, which produces over 9 million tonnes of salt and 1.5 million tonnes of gypsum annually from its three facilities in north-west Australia. Rio Tinto Minerals accounted for 6% of company revenues, and contributed 3% to earnings in 2008.

On 31 January 2010, the management of US Borax locked out its hourly workforce, replacing the workers with nonunion workers and managers from other Rio Tinto operations. The 560 International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 30 members immediately began a fireside vigil that garnered national and international labour attention. ILWU filed several unfair labour practices against the company, including an illegal lock-out claim.

===Iron products and titanium: Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium===

Titanium dioxide is mined at three locations: in Lac Allard Quebec Canada, South Africa and Mandena mine, Madagascar, and refined at QIT-Fer et Titane&#x27;s Canadian facilities.

A media report in October 2013 revealed that the corporation plans to establish a fully automated railroad system for the transportation of iron ore across the Australian outback by 2015, thereby replacing the corporation&#x27;s train drivers. The United Kingdom-based transport historian Christian Wolmar stated at the same time that the train drivers are most likely the highest-paid members of the occupation in the world at that time. As part of an overall strategy to increase profit margins, the corporation is spending US$518 million on the project.

=== Development of autonomous technologies ===

Rio Tinto is a global leader in the development of autonomous technologies for use in the mining sector. As of 2018, Rio Tinto&#x27;s fleet of 80 autonomous Komatsu vehicles had moved over 1 billion tonnes of ore and waste material in Western Australia&#x27;s Pilbara region.

Furthermore, in late 2017 Rio Tinto announced funding for their Koodaideri Mine in Western Australia, which Rio Tinto had dubbed their &quot;intelligent mine.&quot;

==Financial results==
Rio Tinto&#x27;s revenues and earnings have grown substantially in 2003–2010, with one of the largest increases attributable to the company&#x27;s acquisition of Alcan in 2007. Although its operating margin is significantly affected by the market prices of the commodities it produces, it has remained profitable over its recent history.

==Controversies==
=== Poor working conditions ===
The United Steelworkers of America has claimed that mine workers at Kennecott Copper Mine worked for eight months without stopping during a labour dispute about how these workers were treated. This dispute ended with a settlement including a six-year labour agreement, only for Rio Tinto to lay off over 120 workers just two days later. Tom Johnson, a spokesperson from United Steelworkers of America said, &quot;Rio Tinto does not make an effort to use technologies that are more sustainable. They do not discuss with local communities their environmental impact. They operate in secret with governments and with groups that are friendly to them.&quot;

=== London Olympic Games ===
The metals for the medals for the 2012 Summer Olympics were supplied from the Bingham Canyon Mine located in Utah and the Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia, which caused uproar among many activist groups, especially in Utah due to their concern about the impact to the local cities. One person particularly bothered by this decision was the Commissioner of the London Games, Meredith Alexander, who quit her position and led a coalition of human rights and environmental groups during the &quot;Greenwashed Gold Campaign&quot;.

=== Panguna Mine, Papua New Guinea ===
In 2000, Rio Tinto faced a federal lawsuit on behalf of Papua New Guinea due to the harm the company&#x27;s mining operations at the Panguna Mine had to the environment for decades. Local communities filed this suit claiming that the local Kawerong-Jaba river delta was used as a dumping site for &quot;more than one billion tons of mine waste&quot;. According to the lawsuit, the citizens are claiming that the mining giant used harmful chemicals and bulldozers to destroy the environment and specifically the rainforest and used their waterways as a dumping site for the chemicals and runoff caused by their mining operations. These citizens believe that Rio Tinto was targeting them due to their race and culture and was even paying what they referred to as &quot;slave wages&quot; to the company&#x27;s black workers.

=== Rio Tinto massacre ===
During the first years of the company&#x27;s operation in Spain, the company practiced open-air pyrite calcination in blast furnaces. The toxic fumes released by this process had a negative impact on the farmland and the local agriculturists, which led to the company&#x27;s workers and some local anarchists coming together to protest against this practice. On 4 February 1888, several thousand rank and file—agriculturalists, anarchists and mineworkers—marched to the Rio Tinto town hall (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) to deliver their petitions to the mayor. While the mayor spoke with the crowd&#x27;s representatives, the Huelva military governor and civil guards watched over the protest. The military governor&#x27;s attempts to disperse the crowd only incensed it further. The civil guards, under perceived threat of mob violence, fired on the crowd, killing at least 13 and injuring 35.

===Interference from Axis powers during World War II===
Rio Tinto&#x27;s status as a mainly British-owned company, located in Spain and producing pyrites—an important material for military applications—created a complicated set of circumstances for the company&#x27;s operation in the 1930s and 1940s. During the Spanish Civil War, the region in which Rio Tinto&#x27;s mines were located came under the control of General Franco&#x27;s Nationalists in 1936. However, Franco increasingly intervened in the company&#x27;s operations, at times requisitioning pyrite supplies for use by Spain and its Axis allies Germany and Italy, forcing price controls on the company&#x27;s production, restricting exports, and threatening nationalisation of the mines. Although company management (and indirectly, the British government) managed to counteract some of these efforts by Franco, much of the mine&#x27;s pyrite production was channelled to Axis powers before and during World War II. Nonetheless, Franco&#x27;s meddling caused the mine&#x27;s production and profitability to fall precipitously during and after the war, leading the company to ultimately exit from its Spanish operations in 1954.

===Guinean iron ore===
In 2015, Rio Tinto was criticised by the Guinean government for the many mining delays at the local Simandou mine. Cece Noramou, government official said the government was &quot;running out of patience&quot;. President Alpha Conde himself said that &quot;there have been people at Simandou for 15 years, 20 years, and they&#x27;ve never produced a ton of iron&quot;. Even before 2015, the Guinean government had expressed their displeasure and dissatisfaction with Rio Tinto; in 2008, the Guinean government annulled half of the company&#x27;s Simandou rights and gave them to BSGR, a French–Israeli-owned mining company.

In late 2016, Rio Tinto agreed to sell its stake in the Simandou iron ore mine to Chinalco and exit the deal. The deal was negotiated after the company&#x27;s case against Vale and BSGR was dismissed at US District Court.

=== Racism, bullying and sexual harassment ===
In 2022, Rio Tinto released a report that described a work culture of bullying, harassment and racism at the global mining giant, including twenty one complaints by women of actual or attempted rape or sexual assault in the past five years. Elizabeth Broderick, who surveyed more than 10,000 of Rio Tinto&#x27;s 45,000 employees, released an independent report, which found that systemic bullying, sexism and racism were common. According to the report, these harmful behaviours were often tolerated or normalised. &quot;Harmful behaviour by serial perpetrators is often an open secret&quot;, Elizabeth Broderick said. On the whole, about 28% of women and 7% of men had experienced sexual harassment at Rio. But this rate rose to 41% for female workers at FIFO sites. Most women who responded had experienced &quot;everyday sexism&quot;. Near half of the workforce reported being bullied, and described the resultant loss of confidence, declining performance, anxiety and depression. According to Broderick, LGBTIQ+ employees had experienced &quot;elevated rates of bullying, sexual harassment and racism&quot;. A &quot;culture of silence&quot; had kept workers from reporting unacceptable behaviour. People who worked in a country they weren&#x27;t born in had experienced high rates of racism, while almost 40% of men who identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander had endured racism in Australia.

The Australian Human Rights Commission found that, from 2015 and 2020, approximately three in four women had experienced at least some form of sexual harassment while in the mining industry, in part due to a gender imbalance.

===Juukan Gorge destruction===

In May 2020, to expand the Brockman 4 mine, Rio Tinto demolished an Australian Aboriginal sacred site in Juukan Gorge, Western Australia, which had evidence of 46,000 years of continual human occupation, and was considered the only inland prehistoric site in Australia to show signs of continual human occupation through the last Ice Age. The company later revealed it had three alternative options to preserve the site, but chose to destroy it without informing the traditional owners of the alternatives. Permission to destroy the site had been given in 2013 under the state &quot;Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972&quot;, which, however, has been under review since 2018. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples, who are the local land custodians, had fought the decision. The destruction brought widespread criticism.

On 31 May, Rio Tinto apologised for the distress caused. According to 35 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and human rights organisations, Rio Tinto&#x27;s qualified apology is &quot;far from an adequate response to an incident of this magnitude&quot;.

On 9 June, Reconciliation Australia revoked its endorsement of Rio Tinto as partner in reconciliation action plans, defining the behaviour of the corporation a &quot;breathtaking breach of a respectful relationship&quot;&quot; which was &quot;devastating for the Traditional Owners and robbed the world of a uniquely valuable cultural heritage site&quot;. Also on 9 July, The Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) and the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) condemned &quot;the destruction of invaluable cultural heritage at Juukan Gorge&quot;, adding that this &quot;incident is a severe adverse impact on cultural rights that has engendered extreme concern and outrage among the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners of the site as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and their allies&quot;. The CHRB and WBA also called &quot;on Rio Tinto to take appropriate action to carry out an independent investigation of the incident, involving affected stakeholders, to provide effective remedy and to prevent similar impacts in the future, in Australia and elsewhere&quot;. The statement was attached to the company&#x27;s listing in the 2019 Benchmark Report.

On 4 August, in its submission to a parliamentary inquiry looking at the destruction of the sacred rock caves, the company said it &quot;missed opportunities&quot; to alter its mine plan. A dig in 2014 and a final report on the archaeological excavations in 2018 underlined the cultural and historical significance of the caves. Rio Tinto said it did not &quot;clearly communicate&quot; its plan for destroying the sacred site to the native land owners. Although no executives were fired, on 24 August the company announced that three senior executives would lose a combined £3.8 million from their expected bonus payments.

On 11 September 2020, it was announced that, as a result of the destruction at Juukan Gorge, CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other Rio Tinto executives would step down. The National Native Title Council welcomed the move, but said that there should be an independent review into the company&#x27;s procedures and culture to ensure that such an incident could never happen again. Rio Tinto admitted their error, issued an apology via media and on their website, and also committed to building relationships with the traditional owners as well as getting Indigenous people into leadership roles in the company. Jane Crawford Munro comments that &quot;this admission of failure and subsequent acts were precipitated by investors in Rio Tinto.&quot; Yet she adds that, &quot;The admission constituted a major leap forward in acknowledgement of the rights and history of Aboriginal peoples in Australia.&quot; One analysis of what went wrong in Rio Tinto to allow the destruction to occur suggested that processes failed at several levels, but mainly due to its &quot;segmented organisational structure&quot;, a poor reporting structure, and Indigenous relations not being properly represented at a high enough level.

In response to this disaster, the Western Australian government introduced the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021. After being repealed, Rio Tinto wrote to traditional owners to make promises not to backtrack. Rio Tinto was one of thirteen ASX 20 companies in support for the Yes campaign for the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum.

=== 2021 Serbian protests ===
During 2021, a series of mass protests broke out in Serbia against the construction of a lithium mine in Western Serbia by the Rio Tinto corporation. Protesters blocked major roads and bridges in Belgrade and other major cities. In the town of Šabac, there was an incident when a member of the ruling party attacked the protesters with an excavator, and then the protesters were beaten by an armed group of hooligans. The Jadar lithium project is driven by a &quot;significant&quot; supply gap for lithium, as demand for the metal used in electric vehicles (EV) and green technologies continues to soar, particularly in North America and Europe. The project would make Serbia the biggest producer of lithium globally, and provide raw materials to more than 1 million electric cars.

As of 11 December 2021, protests are still ongoing with demands to stop and permanently prohibit any mining-related activity in Jadar region. An activist from Ekološki Ustanak (Environmental Uprising), one of the prominent organisers of the protests, told to the local media that &quot;protests will be continued until the basic demand is met, which is the expulsion of Rio Tinto from Serbia and the adoption of a law banning lithium exploitation in Serbia&quot;.

In December 2021, Rio Tinto said it was considering the concerns of residents in western Serbia after Loznica&#x27;s municipal assembly scrapped a plan to allocate land for a lithium project.

In June 2024, the constitutional court reverted the government&#x27;s decision to remove Rio Tinto from the project, and the president of Serbia announced that he was expecting the company to reveal their final plans for the mine in July and that the mine might be built by 2028. The Serbian public was not pleased with that turn of events, despite the president stating multiple times that the company, alongside the EU, was guaranteeing a higher level of environmental safety, following the protests in 2021. In June a protest against Rio Tinto was held in Loznica and one was held in Belgrade in July. On 16 July 2024, the prime minister of Serbia said in an interview that cancelling the project was a mistake and that the fact that the company was present in Serbia was the previous government&#x27;s fault.

=== Misplaced radioactive capsule ===

In January 2023, the company announced that it had misplaced a capsule of radioactive material that was being transported from their Gudai-Darri mine in Western Australia. The capsule is a 8 by 6 mm cylinder containing a 19-gigabecquerel caesium-137 ceramic source. It has the capability of causing serious illness if it is not handled correctly. According to the company, the capsule was lost somewhere between Newman and Perth, a distance of 1,400 km. The company launched an investigation into the disappearance and are working alongside authorities.

Later the same month the capsule was recovered by investigators and verified by the Australian Defence Forces.

===Environment===
==== Mining ====
Rio Tinto has been widely criticised by environmental groups and at least one national government for the environmental impacts of its mining activities. The most high-level environmental criticism to date has come from the government of Norway, which divested itself from Rio Tinto shares and banned further investment due to environmental concerns. Claims of severe environmental damages related to Rio Tinto&#x27;s engagement in the Grasberg mine in Indonesia led the Government Pension Fund of Norway to exclude Rio Tinto from its investment portfolio. The fund, which is said to be the world&#x27;s second-largest pension fund, sold shares in the company valued at (US$855 million) to avoid contributing to environmental damages caused by the company.

Rio Tinto disputes the claims of environmental damage at the Grasberg mine, and states that the company has long maintained an excellent record on environmental issues.

After the former Panguna copper and gold mine in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, which was abandoned by Rio Tinto in 1989, caused flooding, pollution of water wells and river poisoning, residents of the region filed a request for investigation with the Australian government in September 2020.

As part of a rider of the National Defense Authorization Act, the United States agreed in 2014 to hand over Oak Flat in Arizona to a joint venture of Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton to build the Resolution Copper mine. The proposal has faced significant backlash from environmentalists and the Apache tribe, arguing that the project, if it goes forward, would collapse a region wide around Oak Flat into a sinkhole deep, destroying sacred and ecologically sensitive land. The project would also deplete and contaminate Arizona&#x27;s already limited groundwater supply. US Representative Raúl Grijalva has introduced on four occasions a proposal for the land transfer to be halted, most recently in March 2021 after the Joe Biden administration paused the land transfer.

==== Carbon dioxide emissions ====
According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Rio Tinto is one of the top 100 industrial greenhouse gas producers in the world, accounting for 0.75 per cent of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions between 1988 and 2015. In 2016, Rio Tinto estimated to have produced 32 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in its own climate change report.

In March 2018, Rio Tinto was urged by institutional investors to set new rules requiring the company to adhere to the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, including detailed plans to reduce scope 1 to 3 emissions. Rio Tinto&#x27;s top executives rejected the resolution, arguing that the company had made a lot of progress in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and that appropriate plans were in place to deal with climate change.

Rio also argued that scope 3 emissions, those of its customers, were beyond the firm&#x27;s control. Nevertheless, the corporation in September 2019 signed a partnership with Chinese steelmaker China Baowu Steel Group to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from steel making, in an attempt to tackle the scope 3 issue.

In 2021, Rio unveiled plans to spend $7.5 billion in direct capital expenditure on efforts to decarbonise, announcing new targets of cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions (from their 2018 baseline) by 15% before 2025 and by 50% by 2030 and scope 3 emissions by 30% before 2030. This is to be achieved through 5 GW of wind and solar projects for the Boyne Island and Tomago smelters and 1 GW for Pilbara mining, full electrification of the Pilbara system including all trucks, mobile equipment and rail operations, replacing gas, and investments into green steel and aluminium, joining fellow iron ore giants Fortescue Metals and BHP in the effort to transition to renewable powered operations.

Rio Tinto reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 31,500 Kt (+100/+0.3% y-o-y).

====Labour and human rights====
Academic observers have also expressed concern regarding Rio Tinto&#x27;s operations in Papua New Guinea, which they allege were one catalyst of the Bougainville separatist crisis. The British antipoverty charity War on Want has also criticised Rio Tinto for its complicity in the serious human rights violations which have occurred near the mines it operates in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

On 31 January 2010, Rio Tinto locked out nearly 600 workers from a mine in Boron, California, USA.

Rio Tinto was also accused of planning and funding the murder of RTI activist Shehla Masood in Bhopal, India. Apparently, she was protesting illegal diamond mining done by Rio Tinto in connivance with government officers. The case was, however, solved and no connection to Rio Tinto was established, though popular opinion still perceives them as the possible culprit.

Rio Tinto is not, however, universally condemned for its ethical behaviour. The company has won an award for ethical behaviour, the Worldaware Award for Sustainable Development in 1993. The award, although given by an independent committee, is sponsored by another multinational corporation (in this case, the sponsor was Tate and Lyle). Rio Tinto has, in turn, sponsored its own WorldAware award, the Rio Tinto Award for Long-term Commitment. The British charity Worldaware ceased to exist in March 2005. These awards, awarded to extractive industries which make some environmental commitments to deflect the more general criticisms of their operations, are referred to by corporate watchdog groups as &quot;greenwashing&quot;.

===Corruption allegations===
====In China====

In 2009, Chinese authorities began investigating allegations against Rio Tinto. These included bribing executives from 16 of China&#x27;s biggest steel mill companies to get hold of secret information. On 29 March 2010 four Rio Tinto employees including Australian citizen Stern Hu were found guilty of these charges and of accepting millions of dollars in bribes. They were ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines, and sentenced to 7 to 14 years in jail.

====In Guinea====
Rio Tinto has been embroiled in a number of corruption allegations over its acquisition of stakes in the Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea. The allegations centre around the payment of a $10.5 million bribe to , a French banking consultant who was a friend and adviser of President Alpha Condé.

Rio Tinto launched an internal probe into the matter run by an independent law firm, and on 9 November 2016 announced it would report the findings to the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC), the Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom), the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, and the United States Department of Justice. Rio Tinto also declared they would cooperate with all related investigations and fired two top executives in connection with the matter, one of whom was head of energy and minerals, Alan Davies, who led the Simandou operation in 2011. He was suspended after the investigators discovered suspicious emails discussing contractual payments from that year. Davies claimed that there were no grounds for the termination of his employment.

The President of Guinea, Alpha Condé, denied having any knowledge of the illegal transactions, but recordings obtained by France24 prove otherwise.

Sam Walsh, the retiring CEO of the company, had 80% of his pay withheld while the investigation continue.

Also in early November 2016, Former mining minister of Guinea, Mahmoud Thiam, revealed that the head of Rio Tinto&#x27;s operation in Guinea offered him a bribe in 2010 to win back control of the Simandou mine, and that his offer was supported by senior members of the company.

Rio Tinto is currently facing at least four class action suits in the US demanding damages over the corruption allegations in Guinea. The suit states that Rio Tinto made &quot;materially false and misleading statements&quot; that &quot;deceived&quot; investors.

In July 2017 the Serious Fraud Office announced the launch of a fraud and corruption investigation into the company&#x27;s business practices in Guinea. Following the news of the investigation Rio Tinto shares in the US dropped by 1.4%. The Australian Federal Police is also investigating the allegations. Rio Tinto has announced it would cooperate fully. After the Serious Fraud Office investigation announcement, and amid a search for a new CEO, Rio director John Varley was forced to resign from his role in the company.

On 6 March 2023, the US SEC announced charges against Rio Tinto plc for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of a bribery scheme involving a consultant in Guinea. The company has agreed to pay a $15 million civil penalty to settle the SEC&#x27;s charges.

===SEC Investigation===
The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission investigated a $3 billion impairment charge against Rio Tinto regarding a coal deal it made in Mozambique. Rio acquired Riversdale Mining, an Australian coal mining company with significant interests in Mozambique, in 2011 for $2.9 billion in an all-cash deal. Two years later they wrote down the value of the assets by $3 billion. Following the impairment charge, which included an additional $11 billion in asset write-downs, chief executive officer of Rio Tinto, Tom Albanese stepped down from his post and left the company. Rio later sold the assets for $50 million.

<doc id="1097438" wikidata="Q5154106" url="?curid=1097438" title="Communication Moon Relay">
<text>The Communication Moon Relay project (also known as simply Moon Relay, or, alternatively, Operation Moon Bounce) was a telecommunication project carried out by the United States Navy. Its objective was to develop a secure and reliable method of wireless communication by using the Moon as a natural communications satellite — a technique known as Earth–Moon–Earth communication (EME). Most of the project&#x27;s work took place during the 1950s at the United States Naval Research Laboratory. Operation Moon Relay was spun off from a classified military espionage program known as Passive Moon Relay (PAMOR), which sought to eavesdrop on Soviet military radar signals reflected from the Moon.

==Background==
Communication Moon Relay grew out of many ideas and concepts in radio espionage. Some impetus for the project was provided by post-World War II efforts to develop methods of tracking radio signals, particularly those originating in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Other sources included earlier proposals to use the Moon as a radio wave reflector, which date back to 1928. The first proof of this concept was the Project Diana program of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1946, which detected radar waves bounced off the Moon. This attracted the attention of Donald Menzel. Menzell was a staff member of the Harvard College Observatory and a former United States Navy Reserve commander, who proposed that the Navy undertake a program to use the Moon as a secure communications satellite.

Prior to the Moon Relay project, long distance wireless communication around the curve of the Earth was conducted by skywave (&quot;skip&quot;) transmission, in which radio waves are refracted by the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, which was sometimes disrupted by solar flares and geomagnetic storms. Before artificial satellites, the Moon provided the only reliable celestial object from which to reflect radio waves to communicate between points on opposite sides of the Earth.

The developments in Moon circuit communications eventually came to the attention of James Trexler, a radio engineer at the Naval Research Laboratory. His interest was piqued by a paper published by researchers at an ITT laboratory. Trexler developed plans for a system designed to intercept Soviet radar signals by detecting the transmissions that bounced off the Moon. This program, codenamed &quot;Joe,&quot; began making regular observations in August 1949. Within a year, &quot;Joe&quot; was made an official Navy intelligence program, the Passive Moon Relay (PAMOR).

In September 1950, a new parabolic antenna for the PAMOR project was completed at Stump Neck, Maryland. The first tests of this antenna were impressive; the returning signal was of much higher fidelity than expected. This presented the possibility of using a Moon circuit as a communications circuit. Unfortunately for PAMOR, collecting Soviet radar signals would require a larger antenna. Efforts began to have such an antenna constructed at Sugar Grove, West Virginia.

==Development==
With the PAMOR project requiring a larger antenna, the Stump Neck antenna was pushed into service for testing whether communication via the Moon was possible. This marked the emergence of the Moon Relay as a separate project. Test transmissions between Stump Neck and Washington, D.C. were carried out; the first satellite transmission of voice occurred on July 24, 1954. These were followed by the first transcontinental test of the system on November 20, 1955; the receiving site was the U.S. Navy Electronics Laboratory in San Diego, California. After corrections to reduce signal loss, the transmissions were extended to Wahiawa, Hawaii.

The Navy received the new system favorably. A Navy contract for the project soon followed the successful tests, and, among other things, it was recommended that American submarines use Moon-reflection paths for communications to shore.

==Expansion==
The Moon Relay project was soon transferred to the Communications Section of the Radar Division of the Naval Research Laboratory. Under this department, the system was upgraded to use the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. The experimental system was transformed into a fully operational lunar relay system linking Hawaii with Washington, DC, which became functional in 1959. The new system was officially inaugurated in January 1960, when Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke sent a message to Commander, Pacific Fleet Felix Stump using the system.

The finished system used two sets of transmitters at Annapolis, Maryland and the Opana Radar Site in Hawaii and two sets of receivers at Cheltenham, Maryland and Wahiawa, Hawaii. It was later expanded to accommodate ship-to-shore transmissions to and from the USS &quot;Oxford&quot; (AGTR-1) and USS Liberty (AGTR-5).

==Results==
The Moon Relay system became obsolete in the later 1960s as the Navy implemented its artificial satellite communication system. However, the information gleaned from the project in fact made the later artificial system possible. Additionally, the equipment used in the Communications Moon Relay project was of much use to U.S. Navy astronomers, as they used it to examine the Moon when the Moon was not in a position conducive to radio transmission. Although relatively short-lived, the Moon Relay served as a bridge to modern American military satellite systems.

<text>Lord Valentine&#x27;s Castle is a novel by Robert Silverberg published in 1980.

==Plot summary==
Lord Valentine liberates the planet of Majipoor from tyrannical rule and helps establish a new legitimate government.

==Reception==
&quot;Lord Valentine&#x27;s Castle&quot; won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1981, and was a Hugo Award nominee in 1981.

Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Lord Valentine&#x27;s Castle&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #4 and commented that &quot;despite the detail, despite the novel&#x27;s dreamy pace, Silverberg never loses his reader, is never boring. To the contrary, &quot;Lord Valentine&#x27;s Castle&quot; is, in the demeaning argot of Madison Avenue, a page-turner.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; states, &quot;In terms of sf underpinnings, Majipoor is an inexcusably flimsy construct; and a large cast of promising characters is left rattling around the lengthy and plodding narrative in such a meagerly developed state as to resembled blighted peas in a pod. Disappointing.&quot;

Douglas Cohen for Tor.com said that &quot;The story isn’t a puzzle, challenging readers to figure out whether this tale is science fiction or fantasy. It is science fantasy. It is a successful melding of both genres, as it borrows, tweaks, merges, and in some cases entirely reinvents. Books like Lord Valentine’s Castle seek to take the best of both genres and merge them into a seamless tale. Containing scientific and fantastical elements is both acceptable and expected.&quot;

<text>Norma Precision AB, commonly referred to simply as Norma, is a Swedish manufacturer of firearm ammunition based in Åmotfors, Värmland.

== History ==
Norma was started in 1902 by three Norwegian brothers from Nordre Land, Lars Enger (1850-1917), Johan Enger (1852-1925) and Ivar Enger (1863-1942), whose company L.A.Enger &amp; Co acquired an ammunition factory in Raufoss and later moved to Kristiania (modern day Oslo) as Norma Projektilfabrik A/S (Norma projectile factory stock company) a few years earlier in 1895. The name &quot;Norma&quot; has often been confused as a shorthand for Normandy or &quot;Norge&quot; (Norway in Nordic), however the name was actually chosen because Lars, the eldest of the three brothers, was very fond of the Italian opera &quot;Norma&quot; by Vincenzo Bellini.

The Swedish shooting movement needed a supplier and Norma Projektilfabrik A/S was asked to establish a local presence in Sweden. At this time, Sweden and Norway were in a union. The youngest of three Enger brothers, Ivar (father of polar explorer Lillemor Rachlew), took a train to Sweden and simply got off at the first stop on the other side of the border, Charlottenberg, and made inquiries about a suitable factory building. However he found the town council took no interest in their plans and the only available site had already been taken by a tobacco factory, so he decided to try his luck farther into Sweden. The next train stop was Åmotfors, where the Enger brothers were better welcomed and decided to establish their company.

Just before 1900, the father of the Enger brothers, Asmund Enger, obtained a handful of the secretive French &quot;Balle&quot; D projectiles through a friend during a shooting competition in Paris, and with the help of their foreman and ballistic engineer Karl Wang (1881-1951), the Enger brothers developed a process whereby a boat tail could be applied to a spitzer bullet in a very consistent manner, giving Norma an edge. From the start until the middle of the century, production was dominated by military ammunition standards. After some time, however, the company perceived a market for hunting ammunition. Norma was also beginning to make international connections which, combined with military interest, forced more modern thinking and necessitated new products.

Nils Kvale and Roy Weatherby were invaluable for Norma&#x27;s success in the latter half of the 20th century. Kvale was a product developer for the company in the 1960s and introduced a number of new calibers such as the .308 Norma Magnum and .358 Norma Magnum to the market.

Today, Norma has a yearly production of 100 million rounds in 110 calibers.

<doc id="1097460" wikidata="Q13582005" url="?curid=1097460" title="Camporee">
<text>A camporee is a local or regional gathering of Scouting units for a period of camping and common activities. Similar to a camporee, a jamboree occurs less often and draws units from the entire nation or world. It should not be confused with the Australian term &quot;jamborette&quot;.

==Boy Scouts of America==
In the Boy Scouts of America, districts or councils may hold a camporee once or twice a year. Typically, the camporee involves patrol-based competitions, with events such as: hiking preparedness, fire building, knot tying, first aid, emergency preparedness, pioneering, citizenship, patrol mystery event (team building), outdoor cooking, camping or orienteering. Some camporees also integrate work on merit badges. The camporee may be centered on a central theme such as living history, horsemanship, aquatics, shooting sports, a historical trail, a service project, and most recently Geocaching. Camporees often have a campfire program with awards and presentations, skits and songs. Camporees also may have a service project that helps the hosting facility. Typical service projects could be pruning trees, spreading mulch, clearing brush, trail repair, tree planting or trash pick up.

The scouts usually camp, compete and cook by patrol. The patrol will have a patrol name, patrol flag, patrol cheer or yell and a patrol leader. Patrols are usually made of six to eight scouts, a patrol duty roster is made and posted so patrol responsibilities are rotated, like: head cook, assistant cook, cleanup, KP, fire builder, and water duty.

Councils sometime use the term &quot;camporall&quot; or &quot;scoutoree&quot; for a council level camporee, or they may use a unique name. A Scoutorama is a show of Scouting activities, when combined with a camporee; it may be called a &quot;camporama&quot;. In some southern councils Scoutorama is replaced by &quot;Scout Show&quot;. $2 Tickets or $10 discount card are sold by units to promote Scout Show to the public, and to help raise money for individual units.

The Order of the Arrow is the national honor society of the Boy Scouts of the America, which is a recognized group of scouts that have displayed high enthusiasm and performed at high skill throughout their scouting careers. The Order of the Arrow often helps hold the event or will be leaders for part of the event, like the campfire or hike in. In doing so this gives older boy scouts new leader opportunities.

==Girl Scouts of the USA==
It is common for Girl Scouts to have camporees as well. Sometimes Girl Scout camporees are hosted by council or individual troop leaders, but camporees are frequently hosted by older Girl Scouts.

The campers attending a camporee are usually between the ages of six and ten when they are old enough to be away from their home and family for a weekend, but too young to go camping on their own. Activities at a Girl Scout camporee are oriented towards building character and leadership, while having fun and helping the community at the same time. They might include: earning a patch or badge verifying that they improved skills in a certain area, playing a variety of games, having a traditional bonfire with skits and snacks, and doing a community service project.

== Pathfinders ==
Pathfinder camporees are sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They are organized around large camps, often in parks or land granted by the town hall or host of the event. At these camporees, the Pathfinders camp out and participate in activities such as: competitions for music and Bible knowledge, parades (similar to military parades), and sometimes socio-environmental activities involving the entire local community. The camporee usually ends with an award ceremony based on each of the clubs&#x27; performance. The main goal of the camporee is for the Adventist youth to have a closer relationship with God.

The Pathfinder Club also promotes large camps called &quot;camporees&quot;. These camporees are divided into five levels: Area, Conference, Union, Division and International (previously held in Oshkosh, Wisconsin every five years, now in Gillette, Wyoming). The camporees are the biggest events of interaction between Pathfinder clubs around the world.

The younger sibling to the Pathfinder Club known as the Adventurers Club also conducts periodic camporees.

<text>Edith Mary Oldham Ellis (née Lees; 9 March 1861 – 14 September 1916) was an English writer and women&#x27;s rights activist. She was married to the early sexologist Havelock Ellis.

== Biography ==
Ellis was born on 9 March 1861 in Newton, Lancashire. She was the only child of Samuel Oldham Lees, a landowner, and his wife Mary Laetitia, née Bancroft. She was born prematurely after her mother sustained a head injury during pregnancy and she died when Ellis was an infant. In December 1868, her father married Margaret Ann (Minnie) Faulkner and in time she had a younger half-brother. She did not get on well with her father or his new wife. She was educated at a convent school in 1873 until her father realised that she was taking a strong interest in the Catholic faith. She was removed from the school and sent to another.

She joined the Fellowship of the New Life and she briefly worked with Ramsay MacDonald when they both served as secretaries to the Fellowship. She met Havelock Ellis at a meeting in 1887. The couple married in November 1891.

From the beginning, their marriage was unconventional; she was openly lesbian and at the end of the honeymoon Ellis went back to his bachelor rooms. She had several affairs with women, which her husband was aware of. Their open marriage was the central subject in Havelock Ellis&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot; (1939).

Her first novel, &quot;Seaweed: A Cornish Idyll&quot;, was published in 1898. Around this time Edith began a relationship with Lily Kirkpatrick, an Irish artist based in St Ives; Kirkpatrick died in June 1903.
Ellis had a nervous breakdown in March 1916 and died of diabetes that September. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. &quot;James Hinton: a Sketch&quot;, her biography of surgeon James Hinton, was published posthumously in 1918.

<text>The Qinling () or Qin Mountains, formerly known as the Nanshan (&quot;Southern Mountains&quot;), are a major east–west mountain range in southern Shaanxi Province, China. The mountains mark the divide between the drainage basins of the Yangtze and Yellow River systems, providing a natural boundary between North and South China and support a huge variety of plant and wildlife, some of which is found nowhere else on earth.

To the north is the densely populated Wei River valley, an ancient center of Chinese civilization. To the south is the Han River valley. To the west is the line of mountains along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. To the east are the lower Funiu and Dabie Mountains, which rise out of the coastal plain.

The northern side of the range is prone to hot weather, the rain shadow cast by the physical barrier of the mountains dictating that the land to the north has a semi-arid climate, and is consequently somewhat impoverished in regard to fertility and species diversity. Furthermore, the mountains have also acted in the past as a natural defense against nomadic invasions from the north, as only four passes cross the mountains. In the late 1990s a railway tunnel and a spiral were completed, thereby easing travel across the range.

The highest mountain in the range is Mount Taibai at , which is about west of the ancient Chinese capital of Xi&#x27;an. Three culturally significant peaks in the range are Mount Hua (), Mount Li (), and Mount Maiji ().

== Environment, flora and fauna ==
The environment of the Qin Mountains is a deciduous forest ecoregion.

The Qin Mountains form the watershed of the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins; historically, the former was home to deciduous broadleaf forests, while the latter has milder winters with more rainfall, and was generally covered in warmer, temperate, evergreen broadleaf forests. Thus, the Qin Mountains are commonly used as the demarcation line between northern and southern China.

The low-elevation forests of the Qin foothills are dominated by temperate deciduous trees, like oaks (&quot;Quercus acutissima&quot;, &quot;Q. variabilis&quot;), elm (&quot;Ulmus&quot; spp.), common walnut (&quot;Juglans regia&quot;), maple (&quot;Acer&quot; spp.), ash (&quot;Fraxinus&quot; spp.) and &quot;Celtis&quot; spp. Evergreen species of these low-elevation forests include broadleaf chinquapins (&quot;Castanopsis sclerophylla&quot;), ring-cupped oaks (&quot;Quercus glauca&quot;), and conifers, like &quot;Pinus massoniana&quot;.

At the middle elevations, conifers, like &quot;Pinus armandii&quot;, are mixed with broadleaf birch (&quot;Betula&quot; spp.), oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.), and hornbeams (&quot;Carpinus&quot; spp.); from about , these mid-elevation forests give way to a subalpine forest of firs (&quot;Abies fargesii, A. chensiensis&quot;), &quot;Cunninghamia&quot;, and birch (&quot;Betula&quot; spp.), with rhododendrons (&quot;Rhododendron fastigiatum&quot;) abundant in the understory.

The region is home to a large number of rare plants, of which around 3,000 have been documented. Plant and tree species native to the region include ginkgo (&quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;—thought to be one of the oldest species of tree in the world), as well as Huashan or Armand pine (&quot;Pinus armandii&quot;), Huashan shen (&quot;Physochlaina infundibularis&quot;), &quot;Acer miaotaiense&quot; and Chinese fir. Timber harvesting reached a peak in the 18th century in the Qinling Mountains.

The region is home to the endemic Qinling panda (&quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis&quot;), a brown-and-white subspecies of the giant panda (&quot;A. melanoleuca&quot;), which is protected with the help of the Changqing and Foping nature reserves. An estimated 250 to 280 pandas live in the region, which is thought to represent around one-fifth of the entire wild giant panda population. The Qinling Mountains are also home to many other species of wildlife, including numerous birds, like the crested ibis, Temminck&#x27;s tragopan, golden eagle, black throat and golden pheasants, as well as mammals like the Asiatic golden cat, Asiatic black bear, clouded leopard, golden takin, golden snub-nosed monkey, yellow-throated marten, and leopard.

The Chinese giant salamander (&quot;Andrias davidianus&quot;), at , is one of the largest amphibians in the world, and is critically endangered; it is locally pursued for food, and for use of its body parts in traditional Chinese medicine. An environmental education program is being undertaken to encourage sustainable management of wild populations in the Qin Mountains, and captive-breeding programs have also been set up.

== Weapons of mass destruction ==
According to the Nuclear Information Project, China &quot;keeps most of its nuclear warheads at a central storage facility in the Qinling mountain range, though some are kept at smaller regional storage facilities.&quot;

<doc id="1097469" wikidata="Q572857" url="?curid=1097469" title="Freiberg Germany Temple">
<text>The Freiberg Germany Temple (formerly the Freiberg GDR Temple) is a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), located in Freiberg, Saxony, Germany. The church announced the temple in October 1982, ground was broken for construction on April 23, 1983, and the temple was dedicated on June 29 and June 30, 1985.

==Background==
Built in what was then the German Democratic Republic, the Freiberg Germany Temple was the first LDS temple in a communist state. After the Bern Switzerland Temple was dedicated in 1955, Latter-day Saints throughout Europe visited it for the Endowment and other temple rites. After 1957, East German governmental restrictions on foreign travel prevented the country&#x27;s Latter-day Saints—about 5,000 in 1970—from easily obtaining visas to travel to the temple. Church members repeatedly applied for visas, were rejected, then applied again. An attempt in the early 1970s by Henry Burkhardt, the &quot;de jure&quot; head of the church in East Germany, to present the government with a list of 300 church members interested in visiting the temple almost led to his arrest.

The LDS Church appointed Burkhardt as president of the Germany Dresden Mission in 1969 to comply with a new law requiring churches to be led by East Germans. In the 1970s his role gave Burkhardt access to visas to travel to LDS general conferences in Salt Lake City, Utah. Obtaining the visas required him to meet often with East German government officials, whom church leaders encouraged Burkhardt to build relationships with despite his reluctance. In 1973 and/or 1978, H. Burke Peterson of the Presiding Bishopric, suggested to Burkhardt that the church build an endowment house in East Germany as an alternative to a temple.

==Design==
In 1978, the East German government unexpectedly suggested building an LDS temple within the country. Doing so would reduce visa requests, and was part of a new government policy to cooperate with churches in hopes of obtaining hard currency through construction. The church emphasized temples&#x27; &quot;unantastbar&quot; (&quot;sanctity&quot;) nature to the government, but initially planned for a chapel and an endowment house in one building, so that the latter could be used with the chapel if desecrated. The church intended to locate the building in Karl-Marx-Stadt, a longtime center of Communist ideology, as its LDS congregation needed a new chapel. In 1980 the local government rejected a new chapel within the city despite the national government&#x27;s support, and instead assigned the building to Freiberg, about away.

The choice of the small town instead of a larger city like Leipzig or Dresden surprised members. Although disappointed at first, Burkhardt and church leaders in Utah came to see the Freiberg location as superior. By April 1981, city officials&#x27; welcoming of the project ahead of the forthcoming 800th anniversary of Freiberg&#x27;s founding in 1986 encouraged the church to plan for a separate chapel and temple. In 1982 the government also permitted the church to acquire a hillside site instead of the normal long-term lease. The church announced the forthcoming Freiberg Germany Temple in October 1982, and Thomas S. Monson, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, presided over the groundbreaking on 23 April 1983. The plans did not include an angel Moroni and no request to the government for one was made, although it would likely have permitted a statue if asked.

==Construction==
The government aided in speeding up paperwork and construction for the temple, in part to help commemorate the anniversary of Freiberg&#x27;s founding; by contrast, although the Frankfurt Germany Temple was announced 1½ years before Freiberg, it was not finished until two years after Freiberg. The church also received approval to tap the new Trans-Siberian Pipeline, which passed near the temple, to heat the buildings with natural gas instead of brown coal, which would have required a large, dirty coal plant on the site. The construction used triple glazing and other advanced methods unusual for East Germany, and despite restrictions on imported materials, architects were able to obtain three high-quality Czech crystal chandeliers for the Celestial and sealing rooms at the Leipzig Trade Fair. Because the church was unsure of how long the temple&#x27;s sacredness would remain intact, however, the bulk of the temple&#x27;s materials were of &quot;average&quot; or &quot;mediocre&quot; quality, and steps were not taken to ease future expansion. Unlike the contemporaneous Stockholm and Frankfurt temples, for example, the Freiberg temple did not include an air conditioning system despite its availability in East Germany, causing hundreds to faint during temple rites.

==Dedication==

The temple was open to the public for tours June 3-15, 1985. Those who attended the tours of the temple were able to see the exterior and its German-influenced design with gothic style arches, as well as the interior with its one ordinance room and two sealing rooms. About 90,000 people waited up to seven hours to tour the temple during the open house, despite 21 Stasi agents monitoring and photographing all visitors. The temple was dedicated in seven sessions on June 29-30, 1985, by Gordon B. Hinckley of the First Presidency, and Burkhardt became its first president.

==East German government==
During its existence the German Democratic Republic spied on every LDS congregation&#x27;s meetings, and Burkhardt had at least three Stasi agents monitoring him at all times. The Stasi and other East German government institutions viewed the church as connected to &quot;the right wing of American conservatism...ruling circles within the American government...and the American secret service.&quot; Hinckley expressed the fear during the dedication that the temple might soon become a museum, and during its first few weeks of operation church members who had not visited a temple before received priority in appointments.

As East Germany sought in the 1980s to improve its image abroad, however, the Latter-day Saints&#x27; alleged ties to the United States government and other Western powers worked in the church&#x27;s favor. The Stasi&#x27;s close monitoring of East German members over the years gave the church credibility, as the government came to see Latter-day Saints as citizens of good character who, in keeping with the 12th Article of Faith, did not conspire against the nation. Accordingly, it agreed that no one without a recommend would enter the temple after the dedication, and fears of electronic surveillance proved groundless.

==Expansion and renovation==
After the temple&#x27;s dedication, the grounds—nicknamed &quot;Temple Square&quot; referencing the Utah church center of the same name—became a popular site for local non-LDS newlyweds&#x27; wedding photos. Latter-day Saints popularly attribute a hastened fall of the communist regime, and the Freiberg area&#x27;s prosperity in relatively poor eastern Germany, to the temple&#x27;s presence and influence on the country. After the reunification of Germany on October 3, 1990, the Freiberg and Frankfurt temples made it the second country, after Canada, outside of the United States to have more than one.

The temple received badly needed air conditioning in 1994. Renovations began in 2001 which nearly doubled the square footage to and added 12 oxen to support the baptismal font, a waiting room for those not able to enter the temple, a matron and brides room, as well as an office for the temple president. On December 20, 2001 an angel Moroni statue was placed on top of the temple. A second open house was held August 17-31, 2002. After renovations, Gordon B. Hinckley rededicated the temple on September 7, 2002. Although when dedicated the temple was originally open only to East German church members, it now also serves those in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, and, before the Kyiv Ukraine Temple&#x27;s 2010 dedication, Russia and Ukraine.

Beginning February 9, 2015, the temple closed for renovations that were originally anticipated to take approximately 15 months. On January 21, 2016, the church announced that a public open house would be held from Friday, August 12, 2016 through Saturday, August 27, 2016, excluding Sundays. The temple was rededicated on Sunday, September 4, 2016 by Dieter F. Uchtdorf.

<text>The Wei River () is a major river in west-central China&#x27;s Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. It is the largest tributary of the Yellow River and very important in the early development of Chinese civilization. In ancient times, such as in the Records of the Grand Historian, the river was called Wei Shui (). 

The total length of the Wei River is , covering a drainage area of . Some of the major tributaries include the Luo River, Jing River, Niutou River, Feng River and the Chishui River. In a direct line, it travels due east for before draining into the Yellow River at Tongguan County near the tri-provincial boundary between Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan provinces, with a series of major cities along its course including Tianshui, Baoji, Xianyang, Xi&#x27;an and Weinan.

== Course ==

The source of the Wei River starts in the mountainous region in southern Weiyuan County (literally meaning &quot;Wei&#x27;s source&quot;), Gansu province, with the westernmost headwater of its mainstem Qingyuan River (清源河) less than away from a headwater of Manba River, a main tributary of the Tao River, which is the second-largest tributary of the Yellow River (behind the Wei River itself). The head of the Wei River &quot;proper&quot; — formed by confluence of the Qingyuan River with two small tributaries to its northwest — is less than from the Yellow River at Lanzhou, but due to the sharp north turn the Yellow River takes in Lanzhou to form the Ordos Loop, the Wei and the Yellow River do not meet for more than further along the Yellow River&#x27;s course.

After being joined by numerous other tributaries just east of the Weiyuan County town center, the Wei River turns slightly southeast until it reaches Wushan County, continuing east for before turning slightly southeast again at Gangu County and curves north of Tianshui, the second-largest city of Gansu. After picking up the Ji River (耤河, the urban river of Tianshui) east of the city, the Wei River enters the Mount Long and emerges to become the principal river in the Guanzhong Basin. It drains into the Yellow River south of the boundary between Dali County and Tongguan County, just as the Yellow River bends sharply east to enter the North China Plain.

== Climate ==
The Wei River valley has a continental climate, with hot summers and cool, dry winters. It sits between the arid steppes and deserts to the north and the forests of the Qingling mountains. Its natural vegetation would be a steppe-forest, but it has been transformed by human activity and is mostly agricultural.

== History ==
In Chinese mythology, the giant Kua Fu drained the Yellow River and the Wei River to quench his burning thirst as he pursued the Sun. The valley of the Wei was one of the early cradles of Chinese civilization, along which the capitals of the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties were situated. The area of Dingxi around its headwaters in Gansu has numerous Stone Age sites from various early cultures. The Wei Valley is likely the earliest center of Chinese civilization, and also the location of China&#x27;s first major irrigation works. Some Chinese historians now believe the Wei is the ancient Jiang River that gave its name to the families of Shennong and the Yan emperor, two Chinese legendary heroes credited with the early development of agriculture there.

As &quot;China&#x27;s natural gateway&quot; to the west, the headwaters of the Wei River are also notable in the development of the Northern Silk Road. The Chinese segment of the Northern Silk Road connected Chang&#x27;an (then the capital of China) to the west via Baoji, Tianshui at the Wei&#x27;s headwaters, Lanzhou, Dunhuang, and the Wushao Ling Mountain, before looping north of the Taklamakan on its way to Kashgar and the routes into Parthia.

The Wei River Bridge (Weihe Qiao 渭河桥) featured in the design of the 5000-yuan note of the first series of the renminbi, dated 1953, and shows a train passing over the bridge.

Construction of the Sanmenxia Dam in 1960 caused extensive sedimentation problems in the lower reaches of the Wei river. The construction of the Baojixia diversion works in 1972 and the creation of the Baojixia Irrigation District, with of cropland under irrigation have resulted in reduced flows.

In September 2003 extensive rainfall led to flooding that caused over 30 fatalities, and temporarily displaced over 300,000 people. Ecological aspects of the Wei River have been examined with respect to flow rates in the Wei River.

<doc id="1097486" wikidata="Q1300186" url="?curid=1097486" title="MGR-1 Honest John">
<text>The MGR-1 Honest John rocket was the first nuclear-capable surface-to-surface rocket in the United States arsenal. Originally designated Artillery Rocket XM31, the first unit was tested on 29 June 1951, with the first production rounds delivered in January 1953. Its designation was changed to M31 in September 1953. The first Army units received their rockets by year&#x27;s end and Honest John battalions were deployed in Europe in early 1954. Alternatively, the rocket was capable of carrying an ordinary high-explosive warhead weighing .

==History and development==

Developed at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, the Honest John was a large but simple fin-stabilized, unguided artillery rocket weighing in its initial M31 nuclear-armed version. Mounted on the back of a truck, the rocket was aimed in much the same way as a cannon and then fired up an elevated ramp, igniting four small spin rockets as it cleared the end of the ramp. The M31 had a range of with a 20 kiloton nuclear warhead and was also capable of carrying a conventional warhead.

The M31 system included a truck-mounted, unguided, solid-fueled rocket transported in three separate parts. The Honest John was assembled in the field before launch, mounted on an M289 launcher, and aimed and fired in about 5 minutes. The rocket was originally outfitted with a W7 nuclear warhead, with a variable yield of up to ; in 1959, a W31 warhead with three variants was deployed with yields of 2, 10 or 30 kt (8.4, 41.8 or 125.5 TJ). There was a W31 variant of used exclusively for the Nike Hercules anti-aircraft system. The M31 had a range between .

Early tests exhibited more scatter on target than was acceptable when carrying conventional payloads. Development of an upgraded Honest John, M50, was undertaken to improve accuracy and extend range. The size of the fins was greatly reduced to eliminate weathercocking. Increased spin was applied to restore the positive stability margin that was lost when fin size was reduced. The improved M50, with the smaller fins and more &quot;rifling&quot;, had a maximum range of 30+ miles with a scatter on target of only , demonstrating an accuracy approaching that of tube artillery. The Honest John was manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company of Santa Monica, California.

In the 1960s, sarin nerve gas cluster munitions were also available, designed to be interchangeable for use with either the Honest John or MGM-5 Corporal. Initially the M79 (E19R1) GB cluster warhead, containing 356 M134 (E130R1) bomblets for the M31A1C Honest John. The production model was the M190 (E19R2) GB cluster warhead, containing 356 M139 (E130R2) bomblets when the M31A1C was phased out in favor of the XM50 Honest John. Under nominal conditions it had a mean area of effect of 0.9 square kilometers.

== Variants ==
The two basic versions of Honest John were: 
* MGR-1A (M31) was long, had an engine diameter of , a warhead diameter of , a fin span of , weighed (nuclear), and had a range of . The Hercules Powder Company M6 solid-fueled rocket motor was long, weighed , and had thrust.

* MGR-1B (M50) was long, had an engine diameter of , a warhead diameter of , a fin span of , weighed (nuclear), and had a maximum range of , practically twice that of the M31. An improved propellant formulation gave the rocket motor thrust.

== Production and deployment ==

Production of the MGR-1 variants finished in 1965, with a total production run of more than 7,000 rockets. The Honest John&#x27;s bulbous nose and distinctive truck-mounted launch ramp made it an easily recognized symbol of the Cold War at army bases worldwide and National Guard armories in the U.S.. Even though it was unguided and the first U.S. nuclear ballistic missile, it had a longer service life than all other U.S. ballistic missiles except the Minuteman system. The system was replaced with the MGM-52 Lance missile in 1973, but was deployed with the National Guard units in the United States as late as 1983. Conventionally armed Honest Johns remained in the arsenals of Greece, Turkey and South Korea until at least the late 1990s.

By the time the last Honest Johns were withdrawn from Europe in the late 1980s (and replaced by the unguided M-26 artillery rocket), the rocket had served with the military forces of Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark (non-nuclear), France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway (non-nuclear), South Korea, Taiwan (non-nuclear), and Turkey.

==Name origin==

In late 1950, Major General Holger Toftoy was a colonel overseeing the development of the rocket. The project was in danger of cancellation &quot;on the grounds that such a large unguided rocket could not possibly have had the accuracy to justify further funds.&quot; On a trip to White Sands Missile Range, Toftoy met a Texan man who was prone to making unbelievable statements. Whenever anyone expressed doubt about the man&#x27;s claims, he would respond, &quot;Why, around these parts, I&#x27;m called &#x27;Honest John!&#x27;&quot; Because the project was being questioned, Toftoy felt that the nickname was appropriate for the rocket and suggested the name to his superiors.

*Belgian Army
Used in various Corps and Divisional artillery units (75, 3, 20 and 14th Artillery Battalions) from 1960 to 1978. Replaced by Lance missile.
*Canadian Army

Canada adopted the MGR-1B with the 1-kiloton W31 warhead. Four units were assigned to 1 Surface to Surface Missile Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery at Hemer, Germany under 4 CIBG. Two to four units were supplied to 2 SSM Battery at CFB Shilo in Manitoba for training. These units were formed in September 1960. 1SSM maintained very high readiness and able to deploy to firing positions quickly. Their ability to maintain camouflage kept even elite NATO special forces from locating them in exercises. 1SSM was authorized to wear the black scarf of the Congreve rocket gunners. Canada disbanded the Honest John batteries in mid-1970 without replacement.

<text>James Gordon Gibson (November 28, 1904 – July 17, 1986), often referred to as Gordon Gibson Sr., was a Canadian business leader and politician based in British Columbia. He represented Lillooet from 1953 until his defeat in a byelection in 1955 and North Vancouver from 1960 to 1966 in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a Liberal.

Gibson was a millionaire timber baron whose nickname was &quot;Bull of the Woods&quot; due to his loud lumberjack&#x27;s voice. He was dismissed as a rough, hard-drinking logger who had made it rich, but was loved by many small loggers as being one of the few people to be interested in them over the interests of big business.

==Biography==
Gibson was born at Gold Bottom Creek near Dawson City, Yukon. His father was working a small mining claim while his mother was the camp cook. The claim failed and according to Gordon, he and his brother Clarke were taken out of the Yukon in an orange crate. In the 1920s, he and his brothers ran the Gibson Lumber and Shingle Company. During the Depression, they were active around Vancouver Island, Vancouver and Seattle. The Gibson brothers built a $4,000,000 sawmill business starting at Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island. They had more than 40 boats working the Inside Passage including the five masted 2,000 ton bald headed schooner, the &quot;Malahat&quot;, and the five-masted schooner &quot;K.V. Kruse&quot;. The Gibson family also owned a radio station in North Vancouver and a whaling station at Coal Harbour. Gibson ended up with a 132-foot pleasure boat called the &quot;Norsal&quot; which he renamed the &quot;Maui Lu&quot; (after his first wife, Louise) and sailed it to his resort on Maui. At his resort, Gibson had a totem pole which he had arranged to fly out from Nootka Sound to Maui. At its base was an inscription written in concrete that claimed that it was the first totem pole to fly the Pacific. Gordon took his grandson Mark on the voyage from Vancouver to Maui to give him an experience where the eleven day cruise was full of excitement and adventure. Pete Lovick and Alistair Mellander came along who looked after the engines that almost failed and looked after the course to get the Maui Lui to Hawaii. Everyone learned from Gordon&#x27;s stories from the Roberts Summers issue and the love Gordon had for British Columbia, He was a great Canadian and loved his country.

==Political career==
He was one of four MLAs who managed to get elected in the June 9, 1953 election when the Liberals received 23% of the vote. In the Lillooet riding, Gibson received 27.63% on the first count (in a preferential ballot) but on the third and final count edged out CCF rival Gordon Dowding with 51.93%.

In 1967, Gibson was appointed a member of the Northwest Territories Council.

==Family==
In 1971, he married Ms. Gertrude Schneider and together they ran a hotel on Maui with a restaurant that was very popular.

Gordon Gibson died of lung cancer in 1986.

His son, Gordon Gibson Jr. led the provincial Liberals in the 1970s and carried on to become a prominent political commentator. His daughter, Louanne, raised her family in California and Guatemala before returning to B.C.

<text>The archaeological Gallery Roads () were routes traversing remote mountainous regions of China. The roads were fashioned using wooden planks securely fastened within holes carved into cliff sides. Primarily found in the Qin Mountains, they connected the Wei River and the Han River valleys. The first gallery roads were built during the Warring States period (476–221 BC) and used by Qin to invade Shu and Ba. They were fully consolidated into a thriving network during the Han dynasty. Before the 20th century, very primitive versions were used in the western gorges of the Pamir Mountains.

== Introduction ==

Gallery Roads, Cliff Roads or Plank Roads are notable engineering accomplishments in ancient Chinese history. These infrastructures were predominantly constructed to ease transportation across cliffs in rugged mountainous areas. The Shu Road serves as a prime illustration, traversing some of China&#x27;s most rugged and desolate terrains, including the Qinling and Daba Mountain ranges. Functioning as a crucial link between the Wei River valley and the ancient capital of Chang&#x27;an, this road employed the plank road technique to secure pathways across cliffs and steep ravines.

The construction of gallery roads was tailored to the specific topographical features of the surrounding terrain, resulting in unique structural implementations. The most prevalent type of gallery road is a wooden plank road anchored to cliffs using holes and wooden piles, subsequently covered with wooden boards. An alternative method involved carving stone roads directly into cliff faces.

Modern reconstructions of gallery roads incorporate materials like steel and stone to improve durability. Additionally, specific sections feature glass components aimed at attracting tourists.

== Historical evidence of Gallery Road ==

=== Shudao ===
Shudao is the general name of the historic road that was constructed through the Qinling, Micang and Daba mountainous barrier. The main function of the Shudao is to connect the Wei River valley (today&#x27;s Guan Zhong) with the ancient capital Chang’An (today&#x27;s Xi’An) in the north with Shu (today&#x27;s Chengdu) in the south. The Shu Roads pass through some of the most rugged and desolate terrains in China. The first major highways were most likely built in the Warring States (481–221 BCE) period. During the Qin (221–206 BCE) and Han (206 BCE – 220 CE) dynasties, this road network was massively improved upon. For the most part, the roads were built through natural corridors which had already been established as travel routes by their inhabitants. To build these important paths along the steep and dangerous cliff, the builders used the innovative road-building technique known as &quot;Gallery Road&quot; to fix the roads on the rock walls and cross the mountains, rivers and valleys.

<text>Hanzhong (; abbreviation: Han) is a prefecture-level city in the southwest of Shaanxi province, China, bordering the provinces of Sichuan to the south and Gansu to the west.

The founder of the Han dynasty, Liu Bang, was once enfeoffed as the king of the Hanzhong region after overthrowing the Qin dynasty. During the Chu-Han contention, Liu Bang shortened his title to the King of Han (), and later used it as the name of his imperial dynasty. In this way, Hanzhong was responsible for the naming of the Han dynasty, which was later hailed as the first golden age in imperial Chinese history and lends its name to the principal ethnic group in China.

Hanzhong is located at the modern headwater of the Han River, the largest tributary of the Yangtze River. Hanzhong city covers and is centered around the Hantai District. The prefecture-level city consists of two urban district and nine rural counties. As of the 2020 census, its population was 3,211,462, of whom 1,084,448 lived in the built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area made of Hantai and Nanzheng districts.

==History==

===Pre-Qin dynasty (before 220 BC)===
There are few references to Hanzhong before the Qin dynasty&#x27;s unification of China in 221 BC. The &quot;Book of Documents&quot; refers to an area called Liangzhou (), while Sima Qian&#x27;s book &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; speaks of a &quot;Bao state&quot; (, where the ancient beauty Bao Si came from), both of which are believed to refer to the area now called Hanzhong.

From 900 BC, the area has been called Nanzheng (). The ancient geographical treatise entitled &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; records that Duke Huan of Zheng, a vassal lord from the Western Zhou dynasty, was slain in a battle with the nomadic Quanrong people, and some of the Zheng citizens fled the capital to establish a new settlement to the south, giving rise to the area&#x27;s name. However, the veracity of this story is controversial.

===Qin and Han dynasties (220 BC - 200 AD)===

In the Qin dynasty the area was governed as the Hanzhong Commandery, whose seat was in current day Nanzheng County, south of the Hanzhong urban area. In 207 BC, the Qin dynasty collapsed. Liu Bang, who would later become the founding emperor of the Han dynasty, was made lord of Hanzhong. He spent several years there before raising an army to challenge his arch-rival, Xiang Yu, during the Chu–Han Contention. In 206 BC, after the victory at Gaixia, Liu Bang named his imperial dynasty after his native district, as was customary. However, he chose Hanzhong rather than his birthplace Pei County (present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province). Thus, Hanzhong gave its name to the Han dynasty.

In the second century AD, the Eastern Han dynasty gradually weakened. Outsiders from the Ba region attacked the Hanzhong area, as they had in the past. The Han dynasty lost power. Zhang Lu, supported by followers of a Taoist sect, Way of the Celestial Masters, led an independent theocratic government in Hanzhong. Thirty years later, after the Battle of Yangping, Zhang Lu surrendered Hanzhong to the warlord, Cao Cao.

Prior to and during the Three Kingdoms period, Hanzhong was a militarily strategically important site. It is located at a critical point along the route an army would take from the Central Plain to the Sichuan Basin. At this time, Cao Cao lost control of Hanzhong to Liu Bei, who assumed the title of King of Hanzhong. Ruins and landmarks of the Three Kingdoms era remaining in Hanzhong include the tomb of the Shu Han chancellor Zhuge Liang. Much of this period of Hanzhong&#x27;s history is retold in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

===Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties (618-1368)===
In Hanzhong, between the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Tang dynasty there was political turmoil. In 784, when the capital, Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an) was captured, the Emperor Dezong of Tang fled to Hanzhong. During the Northern Song dynasty (960 - 1127), however, Hanzhong became economically wealthy with city tax revenue just behind that of regional capitals such as Kaifeng and Chengdu.

===Ming and Qing dynasties, and the present (1368-present)===

In 1331, during the Ming dynasty in the reign of the Hongwu Emperor, extensive renovations were made to Hanzhong&#x27;s infrastructure. This work brought Hanzhong to its present layout and form.

The Wanli Emperor (r. 1572-1620) installed his fifth son, Zhu Changhao (), as king of Hanzhong. Changhao built a large, luxurious palace in what is now the Children&#x27;s Park. The palace&#x27;s Radiant Glass Wall () was demolished during road construction in 1935. Since then, a 13.6 m section has been rebuilt on the eastern end of Sanpu Street ().

In 1643, Zhu Changhao fled south to Sichuan ahead of Li Zicheng&#x27;s rebel army. As he departed, his Hanzhong palace was looted. Qing dynasty historians remembered the massive but empty palace.

In December 1949, in the Chinese Civil War, Hanzhong was captured by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) expelled the Kuomintang.

==Administration==
The governance of Hanzhong, including the municipal executive, the legislature and the judiciary are located in Hantai District (). The offices of the CCP and the Public Security Bureau are also located in Hantai District.

Hanzhong consists two urban districts and nine rural counties.

==Economy==

In 2021, the Hanzhong regional gross domestic product was 176.87 billion yuan. The annual gross domestic product per capita was 55279 yuan.

===Military industry===
The 012 base was established in Hanzhong in the 1960s. It is responsible for military transport aircraft and Air-to-air missiles in Yangxian County.
==Geography==

Hanzhong is located in southwestern Shaanxi, near the border with Gansu and Sichuan Provinces. It is part of the Shannan region. Hanzhong lies in the centre of the Hanzhong Basin, on the banks of the Han River (Hanshui).

The Daba Mountains rise to the south of the city. To the north are the Qin Mountains. These mountains make a northern geographical limit of southern China. However, officially, Shaanxi is part of the northwest. For more on the divisions between northern and southern China, see Northern and southern China.

The coordinates of the city&#x27;s prefecture ranges in latitude from 33° 02&#x27; to 33° 22&#x27; N and in longitude from 106° 51&#x27; to 107° 10&#x27; E. It covers . The northern part of the prefecture is elevated while the southern part is generally low lying. Height above sea level varies from around in the urban area to in the Qin Mountains.

The Wuchiapingian Age in the Permian Period of geological time is named from Wuchiaping (from ) in the Liangshan area of Hanzhong.

===Climate===
Hanzhong has a temperate and humid climate. It is classified as humid subtropical (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;), with cool, damp winters and hot, humid summers.

The Qin Mountains to the north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter. Hence, the winter in Hanzhong is warmer than that at similar latitudes east of Shannan. This is despite Hanzhong&#x27;s elevation and inland location.

In contrast, because of its elevation, Hanzhong summers are temperate, with average highs in July and August about . The area is far more humid than central and northern Shaanxi. In Hanzhong, there is precipitation annually, as compared to in Xi&#x27;an, the provincial capital. The chance of sunshine days per month varies from twenty-six percent in November and December to fifty percent in August. Hanzhong receives 1,569 hours of bright sunshine each year. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July. The annual mean is .

=== Cityscape ===


== Transport ==

Hanzhong&#x27;s transport needs are served by the Hanzhong Chenggu Airport and Yangpingguan–Ankang Railway. Hanzhong Airport provides air access to Beijing, Xi&#x27;an, Shanghai and Shenzhen with daily flights to each.

Hanzhong railway station lies in downtown Hanzhong, and is served by the Xi&#x27;an–Chengdu high-speed railway and Yangpingguan–Ankang railway lines.

Hanzhong is also part of a national system of highways. It joins the G5 Beijing-Kunming expressway and the G7011 Shiyan-Hanzhong-Tianshui expressway. National Highway 108, China National Highway 316, China National Highway 210 and the provincial roads 211 and 309 constitute the developed traffic network of Hanzhong.

== Education ==
At the end of 2012, Hanzhong had two hundred and seven middle schools and several centres of higher education.

<text>Tilly Rolston (February 23, 1887 – October 12, 1953) was a Canadian politician.

Initially elected to the British Columbia provincial legislature as a Conservative in the 1941 provincial election, she crossed the floor and joined W.A.C. Bennett in the British Columbia Social Credit Party before the watershed election in 1952.

She was the second woman to be a cabinet minister in British Columbia, and the first woman in Canada to have a portfolio. In her role as Minister of Education, she introduced a new method of school finance that came to be known as the &quot;Rolston Formula&quot;. She was also instrumental in introducing what was effectively a sex-education program into the school curriculum.

She was defeated in the 1953 election by Liberal leader Arthur Laing. Despite her defeat she remained Education Minister until her death from cancer four months later.

<text>Arthur Laing (9 September 1904 – 13 February 1975) was a Canadian politician from British Columbia. Though actively involved with the BC Liberals, his primary achievements were federally as a Liberal Member of Parliament. He served in the cabinets of prime ministers Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau.

==History==
===Early life===
Arthur Laing was born in Eburne, BC on 9 September 1904 to Thomas (1864–1951) and Marion (1870–1949) Laing. His father, a farmer on Sea Island (namely south Eburne), belonged to the group that initiated the BC Federation of Agriculture.

Arthur graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) in 1926. He joined the Vancouver Milling and Grain Company that year. He became manager of the Agriculture Chemicals Division of Buckerfields Ltd. in 1933.

===Political career===
Laing was a member of the Richmond School Board 1930–43, including chair for 8 years. He unsuccessfully ran as the BC Liberals candidate for Delta in 1937 and 1941. Laing was president of the BC Liberals prior to representing Vancouver South 1949–53 in the House of Commons.

He resigned his seat to become leader of the BC Liberals, immediately before the 1953 provincial election. Only three other Liberal candidates were elected to the BC legislature that year. He represented Vancouver-Point Grey 1953–56. He lost in 1956, and in the 1957 Burnaby by-election. After six years in the post, Laing stepped down as the party leader.

Returning as the member for Vancouver South 1962–72, he was Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources (1963), Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (1966), Minister of Public Works (1968), and Minister of Veterans’ Affairs (1972). He sat in the Senate 1972–75.

Many dignitaries were present among the 700 mourners who attended his funeral.

===Marriage and children===
In 1937, he married Geraldine Hyland (possibly Highland) (1909–1978). Linda Laurine, an only child, married David Billingsley.

===Honours===
He was initiated an honorary member of the Blood Band of the Blackfoot Indian Confederacy in 1967. A new government building in Yellowknife was named after him in 1969. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of Vancouver in 1974. Two geographical features, posthumously named in 1975, were the Arthur Laing Peninsula on Ellesmere Island in Canada&#x27;s northernmost national park (Quttinirpaaq), and the Arthur Laing Peak on the Alaska/Yukon border. Although the name was announced in September 1974, the Arthur Laing Bridge, in Metro Vancouver, did not open to traffic until August 27, 1975 and was officially dedicated on May 15, 1976. He had been a strong advocate for this link. Accepted by daughter Linda on his behalf, he received one of the nine LFS Centenary Awards, issued in 2008, for outstanding achievements of UBC alumni.

=== Archives ===
There is an Arthur Laing fonds at Library and Archives Canada.
