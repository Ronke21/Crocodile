<text>In the mathematical field of knot theory, the Jones polynomial is a knot polynomial discovered by Vaughan Jones in 1984. Specifically, it is an invariant of an oriented knot or link which assigns to each oriented knot or link a Laurent polynomial in the variable formula_1 with integer coefficients. 

==Definition by the bracket==

Suppose we have an oriented link formula_2, given as a knot diagram. We will define the Jones polynomial formula_3 by using Louis Kauffman&#x27;s bracket polynomial, which we denote by formula_4. Here the bracket polynomial is a Laurent polynomial in the variable formula_5 with integer coefficients.

First, we define the auxiliary polynomial (also known as the normalized bracket polynomial) 
:formula_6

where formula_7 denotes the writhe of formula_2 in its given diagram. The writhe of a diagram is the number of positive crossings (formula_9 in the figure below) minus the number of negative crossings (formula_10). The writhe is not a knot invariant.

formula_11 is a knot invariant since it is invariant under changes of the diagram of formula_2 by the three Reidemeister moves. Invariance under type II and III Reidemeister moves follows from invariance of the bracket under those moves. The bracket polynomial is known to change by a factor of formula_13 under a type I Reidemeister move. The definition of the formula_14 polynomial given above is designed to nullify this change, since the writhe changes appropriately by formula_15 or formula_16 under type I moves.

Now make the substitution formula_17 in formula_11 to get the Jones polynomial formula_3. This results in a Laurent polynomial with integer coefficients in the variable formula_1.

===Jones polynomial for tangles===

This construction of the Jones polynomial for tangles is a simple generalization of the Kauffman bracket of a link. The construction was developed by Vladimir Turaev and published in 1990.

Let formula_21 be a non-negative integer and formula_22 denote the set of all isotopic types of tangle diagrams, with formula_23 ends, having no crossing points and no closed components (smoothings). Turaev&#x27;s construction makes use of the previous construction for the Kauffman bracket and associates to each formula_23-end oriented tangle an element of the free formula_25-module formula_26, where formula_25 is the ring of Laurent polynomials with integer coefficients in the variable formula_1.

==Definition by braid representation==

Jones&#x27; original formulation of his polynomial came from his study of operator algebras. In Jones&#x27; approach, it resulted from a kind of &quot;trace&quot; of a particular braid representation into an algebra which originally arose while studying certain models, e.g. the Potts model, in statistical mechanics.

Let a link &quot;L&quot; be given. A theorem of Alexander states that it is the trace closure of a braid, say with &quot;n&quot; strands. Now define a representation formula_29 of the braid group on &quot;n&quot; strands, &quot;Bn&quot;, into the Temperley–Lieb algebra formula_30 with coefficients in formula_31 and formula_32. The standard braid generator formula_33 is sent to formula_34, where formula_35 are the standard generators of the Temperley–Lieb algebra. It can be checked easily that this defines a representation.

Take the braid word formula_36 obtained previously from formula_2 and compute formula_38 where formula_39 is the Markov trace. This gives formula_40, where formula_41 formula_42 is the bracket polynomial. This can be seen by considering, as Louis Kauffman did, the Temperley–Lieb algebra as a particular diagram algebra.

An advantage of this approach is that one can pick similar representations into other algebras, such as the &quot;R&quot;-matrix representations, leading to &quot;generalized Jones invariants&quot;.

==Properties==
The Jones polynomial is characterized by taking the value 1 on any diagram of the unknot and satisfies the following skein relation:

::formula_43

where formula_9, formula_10, and formula_46 are three oriented link diagrams that are identical except in one small region where they differ by the crossing changes or smoothing shown in the figure below:

The definition of the Jones polynomial by the bracket makes it simple to show that for a knot formula_47, the Jones polynomial of its mirror image is given by substitution of formula_48 for formula_49 in formula_50. Thus, an amphicheiral knot, a knot equivalent to its mirror image, has palindromic entries in its Jones polynomial. See the article on skein relation for an example of a computation using these relations.

Another remarkable property of this invariant states that the Jones polynomial of an alternating link is an alternating polynomial. This property was proved by Morwen Thistlethwaite in 1987. Another proof of this last property is due to Hernando Burgos-Soto, who also gave an extension of the property to tangles.

The Jones polynomial is not a complete invariant. There exist an infinite number of non-equivalent knots that have the same Jones polynomial. An example of two distinct knots having the same Jones polynomial can be found in the book by Murasugi.

== Colored Jones polynomial ==

For a positive integer formula_51, the formula_51-colored Jones polynomial formula_53 is a generalisation of the Jones polynomial. It is the Reshetikhin–Turaev invariant associated with the formula_54-irreducible representation of the quantum group formula_55. In this scheme, the Jones polynomial is the 1-colored Jones polynomial, the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant associated to the standard representation (irreducible and two-dimensional) of formula_55. One thinks of the strands of a link as being &quot;colored&quot; by a representation, hence the name.

More generally, given a link formula_2 of formula_21 components and representations formula_59 of formula_55, the formula_61-colored Jones polynomial formula_62 is the Reshetikhin–Turaev invariant associated to formula_59 (here we assume the components are ordered). Given two representations formula_64 and formula_65, colored Jones polynomials satisfy the following two properties:
:*formula_66,
:*formula_67, where formula_68 denotes the 2-cabling of formula_2.
These properties are deduced from the fact that colored Jones polynomials are Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.

Let formula_47 be a knot. Recall that by viewing a diagram of formula_47 as an element of the Temperley-Lieb algebra thanks to the Kauffman bracket, one recovers the Jones polynomial of formula_47. Similarly, the formula_51-colored Jones polynomial of formula_47 can be given a combinatorial description using the Jones-Wenzl idempotents, as follows:
:*consider the formula_51-cabling formula_76 of formula_47;
:*view it as an element of the Temperley-Lieb algebra;
:*insert the Jones-Wenzl idempotents on some formula_51 parallel strands.
The resulting element of formula_79 is the formula_51-colored Jones polynomial. See appendix H of for further details.

==Relationship to other theories==

===Link with Chern–Simons theory===
As first shown by Edward Witten, the Jones polynomial of a given knot formula_81 can be obtained by considering Chern–Simons theory on the three-sphere with gauge group formula_82, and computing the vacuum expectation value of a Wilson loop formula_83, associated to formula_81, and the fundamental representation formula_85 of formula_82.

===Link with quantum knot invariants===

By substituting formula_87 for the variable formula_49 of the Jones polynomial and expanding it as the series of h each of the coefficients turn to be the Vassiliev invariant of the knot formula_47. In order to unify the Vassiliev invariants (or, finite type invariants), Maxim Kontsevich constructed the Kontsevich integral. The value of the Kontsevich integral, which is the infinite sum of 1, 3-valued chord diagrams, named the Jacobi chord diagrams, reproduces the Jones polynomial along with the formula_90 weight system studied by Dror Bar-Natan.

===Link with the volume conjecture===

By numerical examinations on some hyperbolic knots, Rinat Kashaev discovered that substituting the &quot;n&quot;-th root of unity into the parameter of the colored Jones polynomial corresponding to the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional representation, and limiting it as &quot;n&quot; grows to infinity, the limit value would give the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement. (See Volume conjecture.)

===Link with Khovanov homology===

In 2000 Mikhail Khovanov constructed a certain chain complex for knots and links and showed that the homology induced from it is a knot invariant (see Khovanov homology). The Jones polynomial is described as the Euler characteristic for this homology.

==Detection of the unknot==
It is an open question whether there is a nontrivial knot with Jones polynomial equal to that of the unknot. It is known that there are nontrivial &quot;links&quot; with Jones polynomial equal to that of the corresponding unlinks by the work of Morwen Thistlethwaite. It was shown by Kronheimer and Mrowka that there is no nontrivial knot with Khovanov homology equal to that of the unknot.

<text>In mathematics, the Alexander polynomial is a knot invariant which assigns a polynomial with integer coefficients to each knot type. James Waddell Alexander II discovered this, the first knot polynomial, in 1923. In 1969, John Conway showed a version of this polynomial, now called the Alexander–Conway polynomial, could be computed using a skein relation, although its significance was not realized until the discovery of the Jones polynomial in 1984. Soon after Conway&#x27;s reworking of the Alexander polynomial, it was realized that a similar skein relation was exhibited in Alexander&#x27;s paper on his polynomial.

==Definition==
Let &quot;K&quot; be a knot in the 3-sphere. Let &quot;X&quot; be the infinite cyclic cover of the knot complement of &quot;K&quot;. This covering can be obtained by cutting the knot complement along a Seifert surface of &quot;K&quot; and gluing together infinitely many copies of the resulting manifold with boundary in a cyclic manner. There is a covering transformation &quot;t&quot; acting on &quot;X&quot;. Consider the first homology (with integer coefficients) of &quot;X&quot;, denoted formula_1. The transformation &quot;t&quot; acts on the homology and so we can consider formula_1 a module over the ring of Laurent polynomials formula_3. This is called the Alexander invariant or Alexander module.

The module is finitely presentable; a presentation matrix for this module is called the Alexander matrix. If the number of generators, formula_4, is less than or equal to the number of relations, formula_5 , then we consider the ideal generated by all formula_6 minors of the matrix; this is the zeroth Fitting ideal or Alexander ideal and does not depend on choice of presentation matrix. If formula_7, set the ideal equal to 0. If the Alexander ideal is principal, take a generator; this is called an Alexander polynomial of the knot. Since this is only unique up to multiplication by the Laurent monomial formula_8, one often fixes a particular unique form. Alexander&#x27;s choice of normalization is to make the polynomial have a positive constant term.

Alexander proved that the Alexander ideal is nonzero and always principal. Thus an Alexander polynomial always exists, and is clearly a knot invariant, denoted formula_9. It turns out that the Alexander polynomial of a knot is the same polynomial for the mirror image knot. In other words, it cannot distinguish between a knot and its mirror image.

==Computing the polynomial==
The following procedure for computing the Alexander polynomial was given by J. W. Alexander in his paper.

Take an oriented diagram of the knot with formula_10 crossings; there are formula_11 regions of the knot diagram. To work out the Alexander polynomial, first one must create an incidence matrix of size formula_12. The formula_10 rows correspond to the formula_10 crossings, and the formula_11 columns to the regions. The values for the matrix entries are either formula_16.

Consider the entry corresponding to a particular region and crossing. If the region is not adjacent to the crossing, the entry is 0. If the region is adjacent to the crossing, the entry depends on its location. The following table gives the entry, determined by the location of the region at the crossing from the perspective of the incoming undercrossing line.

: on the left before undercrossing: formula_17
: on the right before undercrossing: formula_18 
: on the left after undercrossing: formula_19
: on the right after undercrossing: formula_20

Remove two columns corresponding to adjacent regions from the matrix, and work out the determinant of the new formula_21 matrix. Depending on the columns removed, the answer will differ by multiplication by formula_8, where the power of formula_10 is not necessarily the number of crossings in the knot. To resolve this ambiguity, divide out the largest possible power of formula_19 and multiply by formula_20 if necessary, so that the constant term is positive. This gives the Alexander polynomial.

The Alexander polynomial can also be computed from the Seifert matrix.

After the work of J. W. Alexander, Ralph Fox considered a copresentation of the knot group formula_26, and introduced non-commutative differential calculus, which also permits one to compute formula_9.

==Basic properties of the polynomial==

The Alexander polynomial is symmetric: formula_28 for all knots K.

: From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the Poincaré Duality isomorphism formula_29 where formula_30 is the quotient of the field of fractions of formula_31 by formula_31, considered as a formula_31-module, and where formula_34 is the conjugate formula_31-module to formula_36 ie: as an abelian group it is identical to formula_36 but the covering transformation formula_19 acts by formula_39.

Furthermore, the Alexander polynomial evaluates to a unit on 1: formula_40.

: From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the fact that the knot complement is a homology circle, generated by the covering transformation formula_19. More generally if formula_42 is a 3-manifold such that formula_43 it has an Alexander polynomial formula_44 defined as the order ideal of its infinite-cyclic covering space. In this case formula_45 is, up to sign, equal to the order of the torsion subgroup of formula_46.

Every integral Laurent polynomial which is both symmetric and evaluates to a unit at 1 is the Alexander polynomial of a knot.

==Geometric significance of the polynomial==
Since the Alexander ideal is principal, formula_47 if and only if the commutator subgroup of the knot group is perfect (i.e. equal to its own commutator subgroup).

For a topologically slice knot, the Alexander polynomial satisfies the Fox–Milnor condition formula_48 where formula_49 is some other integral Laurent polynomial.

Twice the knot genus is bounded below by the degree of the Alexander polynomial.

Michael Freedman proved that a knot in the 3-sphere is topologically slice; i.e., bounds a &quot;locally-flat&quot; topological disc in the 4-ball, if the Alexander polynomial of the knot is trivial.

Kauffman describes the first construction of the Alexander polynomial via state sums derived from physical models. A survey of these topic and other connections with physics are given in.

There are other relations with surfaces and smooth 4-dimensional topology. For example, under certain assumptions, there is a way of modifying a smooth 4-manifold by performing a surgery that consists of removing a neighborhood of a two-dimensional torus and replacing it with a knot complement crossed with &quot;S&quot;1. The result is a smooth 4-manifold homeomorphic to the original, though now the Seiberg–Witten invariant has been modified by multiplication with the Alexander polynomial of the knot.

Knots with symmetries are known to have restricted Alexander polynomials. Nonetheless, the Alexander polynomial can fail to detect some symmetries, such as strong invertibility.

If the knot complement fibers over the circle, then the Alexander polynomial of the knot is known to be &quot;monic&quot; (the coefficients of the highest and lowest order terms are equal to formula_50). In fact, if formula_51 is a fiber bundle where formula_52 is the knot complement, let formula_53 represent the monodromy, then formula_54 where formula_55 is the induced map on homology.

==Relations to satellite operations==

If a knot formula_56 is a satellite knot with pattern knot formula_57 (there exists an embedding formula_58 such that formula_59, where formula_60 is an unknotted solid torus containing formula_57), then formula_62, where formula_63 is the integer that represents formula_64 in formula_65.

Examples: For a connect-sum formula_66. If formula_56 is an untwisted Whitehead double, then formula_68.

==Alexander–Conway polynomial==
Alexander proved the Alexander polynomial satisfies a skein relation. John Conway later rediscovered this in a different form and showed that the skein relation together with a choice of value on the unknot was enough to determine the polynomial. Conway&#x27;s version is a polynomial in &quot;z&quot; with integer coefficients, denoted formula_69 and called the Alexander–Conway polynomial (also known as Conway polynomial or Conway–Alexander polynomial).

Suppose we are given an oriented link diagram, where formula_70 are link diagrams resulting from crossing and smoothing changes on a local region of a specified crossing of the diagram, as indicated in the figure.
Here are Conway&#x27;s skein relations:

* formula_71 (where O is any diagram of the unknot)
* formula_72

The relationship to the standard Alexander polynomial is given by formula_73. Here formula_74 must be properly normalized (by multiplication of formula_75) to satisfy the skein relation formula_76. Note that this relation gives a Laurent polynomial in &quot;t1/2&quot;.

See knot theory for an example computing the Conway polynomial of the trefoil.

==Relation to Floer homology==

Using pseudo-holomorphic curves, Ozsváth-Szabó and Rasmussen associated a bigraded abelian group, called knot Floer homology, to each isotopy class of knots. The graded Euler characteristic of knot Floer homology is the Alexander polynomial. While the Alexander polynomial gives a lower bound on the genus of a knot, showed that knot Floer homology detects the genus. Similarly, while the Alexander polynomial gives an obstruction to a knot complement fibering over the circle, showed that knot Floer homology completely determines when a knot complement fibers over the circle. The knot Floer homology groups are part of the Heegaard Floer homology family of invariants; see Floer homology for further discussion.

<text>Ambrose Rookwood (c. 1578 – 31 January 1606) was a member of the failed 1605 Gunpowder Plot, a conspiracy to replace the Protestant King James I with a Catholic sovereign. Rookwood was born into a wealthy family of Catholic recusants, and educated by Jesuits in Flanders. His older brother became a Franciscan, and his two younger brothers were ordained as Catholic priests. Rookwood became a horse-breeder. He married the Catholic Elizabeth Tyrwhitt, and had at least two sons.

He was enlisted into the plot in September 1605 by Robert Catesby, a religious zealot whose impatience with James&#x27; treatment of English Catholics had grown so severe that he conspired to blow up the House of Lords with gunpowder, killing the king and much of the Protestant hierarchy. With the other conspirators he had recruited, Catesby also planned to incite a rebellion in the Midlands, during which James&#x27;s nine-year-old daughter Princess Elizabeth would be captured, and installed as titular queen. Rookwood&#x27;s stable of fine horses was essential for the uprising to succeed.

The explosion was planned to coincide with the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605, but the man left in charge of the gunpowder stored beneath the House of Lords, Guy Fawkes, was discovered there and arrested. Rookwood fled the city, and informed Catesby and the others of the plan&#x27;s failure. Together the remaining conspirators rode to Holbeche House in Staffordshire, where on 8 November they were attacked by the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men. Catesby was killed, but Rookwood survived, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London.

Rookwood and the survivors were arraigned on 27 January 1606 in Westminster Hall. Pleading not guilty, he claimed to have loved Catesby &quot;above any worldly man&quot;. He was convicted; his request for mercy was ignored, and he was hanged, drawn and quartered on 31 January, in the Old Palace Yard at Westminster.

==Early life==
Born sometime about 1578, Ambrose Rookwood was the second of four sons born to Robert Rookwood and his second wife, Dorothy Drury, the daughter of Sir William Drury and Elizabeth Sothill. During his first marriage to Bridget Kemp, Robert had sired four sons, but all predeceased their father.

The Rookwood family had lived at Stanningfield in Suffolk for 300 years. Wealthy, and staunch Catholics, the authorities viewed them as trouble-makers. Ambrose&#x27;s Papist cousin Edward had spent ten years in prison for his faith, but in 1578 he entertained Queen Elizabeth I at his home, Euston Hall. It was an expensive visit that made a serious dent in the family&#x27;s finances, and which neutered their influence for years thereafter. Ambrose&#x27;s parents had been imprisoned for their recusancy, and he was indicted on the same charge in February 1605. He was apparently happy to advertise his faith; in the summer of 1605 he commissioned a London cutler, John Craddock, to place a Spanish blade into a sword hilt engraved with the story of the Passion of Christ. As such weapons were generally worn in public, it was &quot;a potentially dangerous statement of faith&quot;.

Ambrose and two of his brothers, Robert and Christopher, were educated by Jesuits at Saint-Omer, then in Flanders. Both brothers became priests (Ambrose&#x27;s elder brother, Henry, became a Franciscan), and his half-sisters Dorothea and Susanna became nuns. According to the Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, Rookwood was &quot;well-built and handsome, if somewhat short&quot;, which he compensated for by his taste in extravagant clothing. In author Antonia Fraser&#x27;s opinion, this affectation was somewhat inappropriate at a time when &quot;clothes were supposed to denote rank rather than money&quot;.

==Marriage, inheritance, and first treason==
In or shortly before 1599 he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Tyrwhitt, of Kettleby in Lincolnshire, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Peter Frescheville, of Staveley in Derbyshire. The Tyrwhitts were another prominent Roman Catholic family and his wife was possibly a first cousin to his future fellow conspirator Robert Keyes. The couple had two sons, Robert and Henry.

On his father&#x27;s death in 1600, he inherited Coldham Hall, which subsequently became a refuge for priests. The following year he joined the Earl of Essex&#x27;s abortive rebellion against the government, for which he was captured and held at Newgate Prison.

==Enlisted==
In August 1605 Rookwood joined the Jesuits Henry Garnet and John Gerard on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Winefride&#x27;s Well in Holywell. Late in September, he was approached by Robert Catesby, Thomas Wintour and John Wright, and invited to join what became known as the Gunpowder Plot. English Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when James I came to the throne, as his attitude appeared to be moderate, even tolerant towards Catholics. In Catesby&#x27;s view, James had reneged on his promises. He therefore planned to kill the king by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder, and then inciting a popular revolt to install James&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth, as titular queen. To this end he had already helped enlist nine Catholics into the conspiracy, but was running out of money and needed to recruit more men. Rookwood was a horse-breeder, and his stable of fine mounts at Coldham Hall was needed for the Midlands uprising. He had been asked to supply them with gunpowder about a year earlier, under the pretence that it was for William Stanley&#x27;s regiment in Flanders—no longer an illegal operation due to the recent Treaty of London—but otherwise provided no funds for the conspiracy.

Although unverifiable, his wife&#x27;s relationship to Robert Keyes may mean that Rookwood already suspected that something was being planned. He was at first concerned for the welfare of the Catholic lords who would be present at the explosion, but his compunction was alleviated when Catesby promised him that they would be tricked out of attending Parliament that day. Any lingering doubts Rookwood had were removed by Catesby&#x27;s lie that the Jesuits had given the scheme their approval. Rookwood had stayed with the Wintours at Huddington Court, and that month with the Catholic Lacons at Kinlet Hall, but at Cateby&#x27;s behest he rented Clopton House near Stratford upon Avon, and moved there after Michaelmas. He took with him several Catholic religious symbols, such as chalices, crucifixes, vestments, Latin books and praying beads. These were concealed in a cellar built by the Jesuit Nicholas Owen.
Toward the end of October he joined Keyes at his lodgings in London. A few days before the planned explosion he changed his mind about the sword he had ordered John Craddock to make, and had the cutler replace the grip with a gold one. The modified sword, which in total probably cost Rookwood more than £20, was delivered on 4 November.

==Discovery==
The existence of the plot had been revealed in an anonymous letter delivered ten days earlier to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to keep away from Parliament. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. He was immediately arrested.

Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter Thomas Percy, and it was therefore Percy&#x27;s name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the government. News of Fawkes&#x27;s capture soon spread through London, prompting Christopher Wright (brother of John) to rush to Thomas Wintour, and tell what had happened. Wintour guessed that the government was looking for Percy, and told Wright to travel to Percy&#x27;s lodgings and &quot;bid him begone&quot;. While Wintour lingered, Christopher Wright and Percy left the city, followed by Keyes, and then Rookwood. A renowned horseman, Rookwood covered 30 miles in two hours on a single horse. Using various steeds he had left along the route, he passed Keyes at Highgate, and then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill near Dunstable. He caught up with Catesby, who had left the previous day to prepare the uprising, and told him what had happened in London. The group, which now included Catesby, his servant Thomas Bates, both Wright brothers, Percy and Rookwood, rode on to Dunchurch.

While Fawkes was being tortured, on 6 November the government began to round up anyone they thought might be involved. Rookwood&#x27;s servants, still in the house their master had so hastily departed, were questioned on the same day. His belongings at Clopton—including several incriminating Catholic symbols—were also taken, and by the time the plotters had reached Catesby&#x27;s family home at Ashby St Ledgers, Rookwood&#x27;s name was among the list of suspects drawn up by the Lord Chief Justice. The fugitives continued on to Dunchurch, where they met the recently recruited conspirator Everard Digby, with his hunting party. The next day the group stole horses from Warwick Castle, although with his fine cortège, Rookwood avoided the town. They then collected stored weapons from Norbrook, and continued on to Huddington. The party tried in vain to expand their number, but were shunned; no one was prepared to risk being labelled a traitor. Father Garnet, contacted at Coughton Court by Bates, wrote Catesby a letter in which he implored the group to stop their &quot;wicked actions&quot;, before himself fleeing.

==Fugitive==
Rookwood was proclaimed a wanted man on 7 November. He went to confession and with the rest of the group took the sacrament—in Fraser&#x27;s opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. Through pouring rain they rode to Hewell Grange, helping themselves to further arms, ammunition and money, and finally reached Holbeche House, on the border of Staffordshire, at about 10:00 pm that night. Tired from three days of riding, they spread in front of the fire some of the now-soaked gunpowder taken from Hewell Grange, to dry out. A stray spark landed on the powder, and Rookwood, Catesby, John Grant and another man were caught up in the resultant conflagration. Rookwood and Catesby were described as &quot;reasonably well&quot;, but Grant was blinded.

Several of the conspirators disappeared into the night, but Rookwood, Catesby, the Wright brothers, Percy and Grant stayed on. By 11:00 am the next day the house was surrounded by 200 of the Sheriff of Worcester&#x27;s men. In the ensuing battle, Wintour was shot in the shoulder. John and Christopher Wright were killed. Catesby and Percy were reportedly both killed by a single musket ball. Rookwood was also shot, but survived and was quickly captured. His belongings should by right have been seized by the government, but his elaborate sword apparently proved to be too great a temptation for the Sheriff&#x27;s men, and disappeared without trace. Rookwood and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. Those conspirators still at large were rounded up shortly after.

==Trial and execution==

Watched in secret by the king and his family, the surviving conspirators were arraigned in Westminster Hall on 27 January 1606. Some of the prisoners hung their heads &quot;as if their hearts were full of doggedness&quot;, while others were nonchalant. All except Digby pleaded &quot;Not Guilty&quot;. Defending himself, Rookwood claimed that he had been enlisted into the plot through his friendship with Catesby, &quot;whom he loved above any worldly man&quot;. He admitted that he could not expect mercy, but asked for it anyway, so as not to leave a &quot;blemish and blot unto all ages&quot;.

His pleas were in vain. The jury convicted him, and he was sentenced to death. Three days later, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were hanged, drawn and quartered at the western end of St Paul&#x27;s churchyard. The following day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were tied to wattled hurdles and dragged by horse from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster—a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators. Rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in the Strand, so that he could open his eyes and see his wife, waiting at the window. He shouted &quot;Pray for me, pray for me!&quot; According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth answered, &quot;I will, and be of good courage. Offer theyself wholly to God. I, for my part, do as freely restore thee to God as He gave thee unto me.&quot; For the rest of the journey he kept his eyes closed, in prayer. Thomas Wintour was the first that day to be hanged and then killed. Rookwood was next, and made a short speech to the assembled audience. He was repentant, asking God to bless the king, queen, and their &quot;royal progeny&quot;, but &quot;spoil[ed] all the pottage with one filthy weed&quot; by beseeching God to make the king a Catholic. He seems to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before suffering the remainder of his sentence.

<text>The Technikon Witwatersrand was a technikon located in Johannesburg, South Africa. On 1 January 2005, it merged with Rand Afrikaans University and the Soweto and East Rand campuses of Vista University to form the University of Johannesburg. The former Vista University East Rand Campus has subsequently been permanently closed.

==Origins==
Technikon Witwatersrand traces its roots back to the beginning of the 20th century to the Transvaal Technical Institute, which was established in 1903 to serve the needs of the gold-mining industry. For the greater part of its existence, it was housed in a temporary wood and corrugated iron structure, affectionately known as the Tin Temple, on the corner of Rissik and Plein streets in central Johannesburg. The Institute grew and developed, and in time gave rise to the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria. In 1923, an Act of Parliament made provision for technical training, which led to the establishment of the Witwatersrand Technical Institute in 1925. This was the founding date of the Technikon Witwatersrand. The Witwatersrand Technical Institute underwent a series of changes: it became the Witwatersrand Technical College in 1930, the Witwatersrand College for Advanced Technical Education in 1968 and finally, the Technikon Witwatersrand in 1979. Today, it is a large and complex institution. Some 12,000 students and 1,200 staff members from all spheres of the city&#x27;s multifaceted community make up a vibrant educational centre extending across the east–west axis of Johannesburg.

==The merger==
On 31 May 2002, the Minister of Education, Kader Asmal, released the government&#x27;s proposals for the restructuring of higher education in South Africa. Mergers between various educational institutions in South Africa were then proposed as necessary to the restructuring process.

Rand Afrikaans University and Technikon Witwatersrand were two of the institutions that were selected to merge with each other and are to become one comprehensive institution. Officially, the Technikon Witwatersrand and Rand Afrikaans University merged on 1 January 2005 to form a new institution by the name of the University of Johannesburg. The new institution offers both academic and technology degrees. The final meetings and preparations took place in 2004 so as to ensure that all structures were in place and that everything ran smoothly when the University of Johannesburg opened in 2005.</text><links>

<doc id="1107650" wikidata="Q1133142" url="?curid=1107650" title="Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University">
<text>, commonly referred to as APU, is a private university in Beppu, Ōita, Japan. APU was established in 2000 through the collaboration of three parties from the public and private sectors: Ōita Prefecture, Beppu City, and the Ritsumeikan Trust.

The university has an enrollment of about 5,850, including approximately 2,900 domestic, and 2,900 international students (a 50–50 domestic-international ratio) originating from 90 countries and regions. Half of the 172 full-time faculty members are also foreign nationals who come from more than 30 countries and regions.

==Location==
The Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University is located in Beppu, Ōita, on the island of Kyushu in southern Japan.

==Background==
Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University is a member of the Ritsumeikan Trust which includes APU, Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto and Lake Biwa and primary, junior and senior high schools throughout Japan. In the early 1990s the concept of creating an international university in the city of Beppu was first raised by the governor of Ōita Prefecture, Morihiko Hiramatsu, with the then chancellor of the Ritsumeikan Trust in Kyoto, Mr Kawamoto. A chief proponent of the concept and design was Professor Makitaro Hotta. The university opened at Jumonjibaru, north of Beppu City in April 2000.

The university was founded on the ideals of &quot;freedom, peace, humanity, international mutual understanding, and the future shape of the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; The school&#x27;s tagline &quot;Shape Your World&quot; was created in 2008 to evoke the image of students coming from all over the world to creating oneself as well as the world.

==Campus features==

===Programs===
APU has 3 colleges:
* College of Asia Pacific Studies.
* College of International Management.
* College of Sustainability and Tourism (from Academic Year 2023).

The academic program is offered based on 2 semesters, and each semester is divided into two quarters lasting for seven weeks. In general, most of the classes in APU are carried out on a quarter system. Unlike many other universities in Japan, students are enrolled and graduate twice a year, in spring and fall semester.

APU offers undergraduate studies in subjects including liberal arts such as media studies, language subjects, and Japanese traditional arts. It offers special lecture subjects, which are added to and may change every semester. Students select their own classes and are not restricted to classes in their majors. However, students can only choose classes in their respective curriculum according to their enrollment year, for the curriculum has undergone changes three times since the university was founded.

From academic year 2000 upto 2022, undergraduate programs are conducted in the College of International Management and College of Asia Pacific Studies. The College of International Management (APM) consists of four areas of study: 
* Accounting and Finance (会計・ファイナンス), 
* Marketing (マーケティンク), 
* Strategic Management and Organization (経営戦略と組織), 
* Innovation and Economics (イノベーション・経済学). 

The College of Asia Pacific Studies (APS) has also established four areas of study: 
* Environment &amp; Development (環境・開発), 
* Hospitality &amp; Tourism (観光学), 
* International Relations &amp; Peace Studies (国際関係), 
* Culture, Society &amp; Media (文化・社会・メディア). 
Furthermore, students must complete compulsory language education credits in either English or Japanese.

Specialized post-graduate programs are conducted in the Graduate School of Asia Pacific Studies and Graduate School of Management. The graduate programs are conducted exclusively in English.

===Japanese-English bilingual education system===
APU practices a bilingual education system in English and Japanese, in a multicultural and multilingual environment in which about half of the teachers are foreign nationals. In the 1st and 2nd year, students will study foundational education in their standard language (English or Japanese) and at the same time work on acquisition of the other language. By the 3rd and 4th years, all students will develop linguistic performance ability to receive specialized education in both Japanese and English. Handouts and notices will be written in both Japanese and English, and guidance will be given in Japanese and English.

===CLE (Center For Language Education)===

In addition to regular programs in Japanese and English, the Center for Language Education offers six languages of the Asia-Pacific region with a curriculum that is linked to programs such as active learning.

===Asia Pacific Language===

Six languages in the Asia-Pacific region are offered, from introductory to advanced, in Chinese, Korean, Malay / Indonesian, Spanish, Thai, and Vietnamese. In APU, these are called the &quot;AP languages.&quot;

===Enrollment===
As of 1 November 2016, the university has a total enrollment of around 5,850 students, down from the 2009 figure of 6,162. Currently there are 5,553 students in undergraduate programs, 178 at postgraduate level, and 117 non-degree students. The students are equally distributed between APU&#x27;s two schools, the College of Asia Pacific Studies (2,786), and the College of International Management (2,731).

While 2,904 of these students are domestic Japanese, 2,944 (about 50.3%) are international students from 90 countries and regions. This ratio is a feature unique to APU amongst Japanese universities; APU is second only to Waseda University in the absolute number of international students enrolled. In terms of country of origin, the majority of international students come from eastern Asia, namely South Korea (499 as of 1 November 2016), Vietnam (476), China (437), Indonesia (346), Thailand (281), and Bangladesh (87).

===Facilities===

The library provides paper-based as well as electronic media including, academic databases, magazines, newspaper, textbooks, and DVD. Visitors can request media from other Ritsumeikan campuses which will be delivered to the library counter. Recently the library has included other services such as a writing center and meeting spaces for collaborative work.

===Extracurricular activities===
There are over 100 student organizations (known as clubs or circles) available at APU, which cover categories of sports, academic research, arts, and social organizations (such as volunteers). Students are free to join clubs they are interested in, and they can create new ones, too. Examples of student organizations include APU Yosshakoi (Japanese traditional dance group), PRENGO (volunteer group), APU Wind Orchestra, Muay Thai (Thai boxing), and Global Business Leader. Since 2015, APU has also been host to the Global Business Case competition.

===On-campus housing===
The on-campus housing, AP House, offers international students the opportunity to live next to the campus for their first year as they learn the ways and customs of life in Japan. Single and shared rooms are available. AP house provides shared facilities and borrowable items to the residents. Support faculty and staff members are on site, in addition to resident assistants (RA) recruited from the resident student body. RAs play an important role at AP House by supporting residents and promoting interaction and exchange. They also hold some events such as AP House Entrance Ceremony &amp; Welcome Dinner Party and The AP House &quot;World Festival.&quot;

<doc id="1107662" wikidata="Q3061452" url="?curid=1107662" title="Everard Digby">
<text>Sir Everard Digby (c. 1578 – 30 January 1606) was a member of the group of provincial members of the English nobility who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Although he was raised in an Anglican household and married a Protestant, Digby and his wife were secretly received into the strictly illegal and underground Catholic Church in England by the Jesuit priest Fr. John Gerard. In the autumn of 1605, he made a Christian pilgrimage to the shrine of St Winefride&#x27;s Well in Holywell, Wales. About this time, he met Robert Catesby, who was planning to blow up the House of Lords with gunpowder as an alleged act of tyrannicide and a decapitation strike against King James I. Catesby then planned to lead a popular uprising aimed at regime change, through which a Catholic monarch would be placed upon the English throne.

The full extent of Digby&#x27;s knowledge of and involvement in the plot is unknown, but at Catesby&#x27;s behest, Digby rented Coughton Court and prepared a &quot;hunting party&quot;, ready for the planned uprising. The plot failed, however, and Digby joined the conspirators as they took flight through the Midlands, failing to garner support along their way. Digby left the other fugitives at Holbeche House in Staffordshire, and was soon captured and taken to the Tower of London.

Digby was tried on 27 January 1606. Despite an eloquent defence, he was found guilty of high treason, and three days later was hanged, drawn and quartered.

==Origins==
The Digby family was of Leicestershire origin. Sir John Digby (d. 1269) served on two crusades, and, by 1418, Sir Everard &quot;Greenleaf&quot; Digby was Lord of Tilton and owner of the manor at Drystoke (Stoke Dry), and Rutland&#x27;s Member of Parliament. Sir Everard lost his life (and his family much of their fortune) fighting in 1461 for Henry VI against Edward IV. The family had a more positive reversal of fortune in 1485 when Sir Everard&#x27;s sons fought for the victorious Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth Field.

==Early life==
Everard Digby was the eldest son of Everard Digby, Esquire (who died in 1592) and his wife Maria (née Neale), daughter of Francis Neale of Keythorpe in Leicestershire. The conspirator was a cousin of Anne Vaux, who for years placed herself at considerable risk by sheltering Jesuit priests such as Henry Garnet. He was probably a near kinsman of the 16th-century scholar Everard Digby, but it is clear that the scholar, who died in 1605, was not his father, because as a Fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (a celibate calling) he could not have been married at the time when the young Everard and some of his 13 siblings were born, nor was he &quot;Esquire&quot;, as the father is named in his &quot;inquisition post mortem&quot; of 1592.

In 1596, while still a teenager, he married Mary Mulshaw (or Mushlo), a young heiress who brought with her Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire. By all accounts their marriage was a happy one, and they had two sons; Kenelm Digby was born in 1603 at Gayhurst, and John in 1605. Unlike other English Catholics, Digby had little first-hand experience of England&#x27;s recusancy laws. Following the death of his father he had been made a ward of Chancery and was raised in a Protestant household. His wife Mary was converted to Catholicism by the Jesuit priest John Gerard. When Digby fell seriously ill, Gerard used the occasion to convert him also, and the two subsequently became close friends, &quot;calling eachother &#x27;brother&#x27; when we wrote and spoke&quot;. Gerard was godfather to Digby&#x27;s eldest son, Kenelm, and the Digbys also built a hidden chapel and sacristy at Gayhurst.

Digby frequented the court of Elizabeth I, and became informally associated with the Elizabethan gentlemen pensioners. His marriage had significantly expanded his holdings, however, and possibly for this reason he left court to manage his estates. He was apparently an unforgiving landlord, as his tenants in Tilton petitioned the Crown for redress when he failed to honour the expensive leases granted them by his father. He added to his property in Buckinghamshire by buying land in Great Missenden, and a month after the queen&#x27;s death his social station was elevated when on 24 April 1603 he was knighted by James I at Belvoir Castle. Four days later he was present for Elizabeth&#x27;s funeral in London.

==Robert Catesby==

In late August or early September 1605, Digby, his wife Mary, and their secret Jesuit chaplain Edward Oldcorne joined a pilgrimage organised by, amongst others, Henry Garnet and Anne Vaux. The party had set out from White Webbs at Enfield Chase, heading for the shrine of St Winefride&#x27;s Well at Holywell, and had occasionally stopped along the way to collect more followers. As the thirty or so pilgrims returned from Holywell in mid-September, they stopped at Rushton Hall where Sir Thomas Tresham had recently died, and then continued on to Digby&#x27;s seat at Gayhurst.

On 21 October Digby, his wife Mary, Garnet and Vaux were at Harrowden celebrating a delayed Feast of St Luke. While there he met Robert Catesby, who at some point asked him to swear an oath of secrecy before introducing him to what later became known as the Gunpowder Plot. English Catholics had hoped that the years of persecution they suffered during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign would end when James I came to the throne, as his attitude appeared moderate, even tolerant towards Catholics. In Catesby&#x27;s view, however, James had reneged on his promises, and he had quickly lost patience with the new Stuart Dynasty. He therefore planned to kill James by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder, and then inciting a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the throne. Catesby had enlisted the aid of other Catholics, but had borne much of the scheme&#x27;s financial cost and was running out of money. The group had therefore agreed to expand their numbers. To this end Catesby had recruited Ambrose Rookwood—a young and wealthy Catholic with a stable of fine horses—and a wealthy cousin, Francis Tresham.

The extent of Digby&#x27;s knowledge of the plot is unknown, but in the opinion of author Alan Haynes, Digby was shocked by what he heard, and asked what would become of some of their Catholic friends. Catesby replied &quot;Assure your selfe that such of the nobilitie as are worth the saving shalbe preserved and yet knowe not of the matter.&quot; None of their friends would be caught in the explosion. He asked if Catesby had spoken of the matter with Garnet, or any other Jesuits; although Catesby was in no doubt that the Jesuits disapproved of any such action, he lied and said that he would not act without their approbation. Catesby then named the other conspirators, and promised Digby that as soon as they reached Gayhurst he would demonstrate that their religion allowed such acts of regicide, thus dissuading the young lord from confessing to Garnet and discovering the Jesuit&#x27;s opinion of the matter. Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court from the head of the Throckmorton family, so that he would &quot;the better to be able to do good to the cause [kidnap Princess Elizabeth]&quot;. From there, he was to organise a hunting party (in reality a group of armed men on horseback) and be ready for some kind of military manoeuvre. Digby also provided monetary assistance; he promised £1,500 after fellow plotter Thomas Percy failed to pay the rent due for several properties in Westminster.

==Hunting party==

On 2 November at Gayhurst, while making preparations for his hunting party, Digby was visited by Gerard. Having noticed that the house was almost completely empty, the Jesuit asked him if there was &quot;any matter in hand&quot; and if Garnet knew of it. Keen not to implicate Gerard, despite being told less than two weeks earlier that the plot had Jesuit approval, Digby told him that there was nothing he knew of &quot;or could tell him of&quot;. Although Gerard later used this conversation to defend himself against those who accused him of involvement in the plot, he lived to regret not being given the opportunity to dissuade Digby from his course.

Two days later Digby and his servants were ensconced at the Red Lion inn, in Dunchurch, where his hunt was to take place. He took with him several items of clothing, including &quot;a white satin doublet cut with purple&quot;. Also present, but uninvolved, were his uncle, Sir Robert Digby, Humphrey Littleton and his nephew Stephen Littleton. They ate supper, before being joined by fellow conspirator John Grant and a friend. Also invited was the stepbrother of plotters Robert and Thomas Wintour, John Wintour. They attended a mass the next morning, conducted by a Father Hammond, before the party moved on.

Around midnight on 4 November, Guy Fawkes was discovered guarding the gunpowder the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords, and arrested. Those conspirators still in London soon took flight for the Midlands, finding along the way those who had already left to prepare for the planned uprising. They met Digby and his party at Dunchurch. Catesby told Digby that the king and Salisbury were dead, and &quot;if true Catholics would now stir, he doubted not that they might procure to themselves good conditions&quot;. Digby was won over, but many of his party were less than impressed at being so badly deceived, and worse, being associated with treason. One of his servants asked Digby what would happen to them; Digby told him that although he was aware of their ignorance, &quot;but now there is no remedy&quot;.

==Flight==
On 6 November the fugitives raided Warwick Castle and managed to secure more horses, before moving on to Norbrook to collect stored weapons. From there they continued their journey toward Huddington. Catesby ordered his servant (and fellow plotter) Thomas Bates to deliver a letter to Father Garnet at Coughton Court. Catesby and Digby asked Garnet to excuse their recklessness, before asking for his help in raising an army in Wales. Garnet&#x27;s reply begged them to stop their &quot;wicked actions&quot;, and to listen to the Pope&#x27;s teachings. When the priest tried to comfort Mary Digby, also at Coughton Court, she burst into tears.

With their ever-decreasing band of supporters, the remaining fugitives arrived at Huddington at about 2:00 pm. Any expectation they had of support began to vanish; almost everyone they met showed concern only for their own safety, fearful of being involved with traitors. The next morning they rode through the rain, stopping briefly to help themselves to supplies from the home of the absent Lord Windsor at Hewell Grange. Still the locals refused to have anything to do with them; Digby later admitted that &quot;not one man&quot; joined them. They arrived that night at Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire, and tired and desperate, spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out. A spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and another man.

==Surrender==
Catesby and fellow conspirators Thomas Percy, John Wright and his brother Christopher were killed by the Sheriff of Worcester&#x27;s men early on 8 November, but Digby had already left to give himself up (the only conspirator to do so). With two servants, possibly Bates and his son, he took several horses and hid in nearby woods. Their tracks were soon found, however, and with some hesitation (Digby had intended to surrender himself to someone more worthy), early that morning he presented himself to the most senior-looking of his adversaries. While Digby was taken to the Tower of London, Gayhurst was ransacked; the servants&#x27; belongings were stolen, the livestock was sold cheaply, and Mary Digby was left destitute. The sheriff later remarked &quot;All goods are carried away, even to the very floor of the great parlour.&quot; At the Tower, Digby&#x27;s two trunks of clothing were searched, and found to contain £100 in gold, and £50 in white money. William Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, asked if he could take £50 to pay for Digby&#x27;s food and bedding.
Digby unsuccessfully sought an audience with James to try and explain himself, in Fraser&#x27;s opinion suggesting either that the extent of his involvement was limited, or that he was &quot;astonishingly naive and trusting of his sovereign&#x27;s forgiveness.&quot; While imprisoned he busied himself with writing secret letters, smuggled from the Tower and not rediscovered until Kenelm Digby&#x27;s death in 1665. Although he was fortunate not to suffer the fate of Guy Fawkes, who was tortured on several occasions, one of these letters hints that it had been &quot;in a fashion, offered&quot;. He described his refusal to cooperate with his interrogators, boasted of his deceit, and how there was nothing he could do to make the plot appear less abhorrent to fellow Catholics. Digby also carved an inscription on the wall of his cell, extant as of 1996.

In December 1605 Mary Digby wrote to the Earl of Salisbury complaining that the Sheriff of Buckinghamshire had allowed people to strip their house for his profit, even her closet, and had not allowed them any of their clothes or linen. She entreated him for the life of her husband and his intercession with King James.

==Trial and execution==

Digby was tried on the same day as seven of his surviving co-conspirators, in Westminster Hall, on Monday 27 January 1606. As the king and his family watched in secret, the charges against the plotters were read aloud. Alone amongst them Digby pleaded &quot;Guilty&quot;, and was tried on a separate indictment. Dressed in a black satin suit and &quot;tuff taffetie gown&quot;, he gave a short and moving speech, defending his actions by explaining his affection for Catesby, and the cause of his religion. He accused King James of reneging on his promises of toleration for Catholics, and told of his fears of harsher laws against recusancy. He also pleaded on behalf of his family, that they should not pay for his actions, before making a final request to be beheaded. His words fell on mostly deaf ears. The prosecution poured scorn on James&#x27;s supposed perfidy, and ridiculed Digby for asking for leniency where he would have given none. Along with the other plotters, he was found guilty. As they were led from the hall, Digby exclaimed: &quot;If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows.&quot; The reply came back, &quot;God forgive you, and we do.&quot;

He spent his last few days in the Tower writing letters to his wife and his sons, urging the two brothers to avoid the examples set by figures such as Cain and Abel. He also wrote poetry:

:Who&#x27;s that which knocks? Oh stay, my Lord, I come:
:I know that call, since first it made me know
:Myself, which makes me now with joy to run
:Lest he be gone that can my duty show.
::Jesu, my Lord, I know thee by the Cross
::Thou offer&#x27;st me, but not unto my loss.

Digby was hanged, drawn and quartered early on Thursday 30 January. Throngs of spectators lined the streets as he was strapped to a wattled hurdle, and alongside Robert Wintour and John Grant was dragged by horse to the western end of Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral churchyard. Thomas Bates was delivered in a similar fashion, but from the Gatehouse Prison. Armed guards interspersed along the route were there to defend against any possible rescue, but did not keep the miscreants&#x27; families from witnessing the fate of the four men. Cold and grubby, Digby was the first of the four to face the executioner. He mounted the scaffold and addressed the audience, telling them that he knew he had broken the law, but that morally, and in the eyes of his religion, he had committed no offence. He asked for God&#x27;s forgiveness, and the country&#x27;s, and protested the Jesuits&#x27; and Father Gerard&#x27;s innocence. He refused the attentions of a Protestant clergyman, speaking to himself in Latin, before saying goodbye to his friends.

Digby was then stripped of his clothing, except for his shirt. Murmuring &quot;O Jesus, Jesus, save me and keep me&quot;, he climbed the ladder and was hanged for a short period. The executioner cut the rope, and Digby fell back to the scaffold, wounding his forehead. Fully conscious, he was taken to the block and castrated, disembowelled, and quartered. Wintour, Grant and Bates followed. The remaining four conspirators suffered similar fates the following day, at the Old Palace Yard in Westminster.

<text>John Walker Motson (10 July 1945 – 23 February 2023) was an English football commentator. Beginning as a television commentator with the BBC in 1971, he commentated on over 2000 games on television and radio. From the late 1970s to 2008, Motson was the dominant football commentary figure at the BBC, apart from a brief spell in the mid-1990s.

Motson often wore a sheepskin coat (his &#x27;Motty&#x27; coat) during winter months after he reportedly &quot;battled horizontal sleet showers ahead of Wycombe Wanderers&#x27; FA Cup tie with Peterborough United&quot; in December 1990. These coats became Motson&#x27;s trademark look, making him instantly recognisable to his audience.

In 2008, Motson announced his retirement from live television commentary. He continued to cover games for &quot;Match of the Day&quot; highlights and appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live as well as commentating on CBeebies&#x27; &quot;Footy Pups&quot;. In September 2017, he announced his full retirement from BBC commentary, having commentated on 10 FIFA World Cups, 10 UEFA European Championships, and 29 FA Cup finals. In July 2018, he announced he was returning from retirement to work for Talksport.

== Early years ==
Motson was born in Salford, Lancashire, where his father was a Methodist minister. He was baptised in Boston, Lincolnshire, and spent childhood holidays there. As a child, he was a follower of Boston United and recalled the club&#x27;s victory over Derby County in the FA Cup in 1955.

He was educated at Culford School, near Bury St Edmunds. Culford is a public school where football was generally frowned upon at the time; rugby union, field hockey, and cricket were the main sports for pupils.

In 1963, Motson&#x27;s career began as a newspaper reporter in Chipping Barnet. In 1967 and 1968, he worked for the &quot;Sheffield Morning Telegraph&quot; where he first covered football.

== Broadcasting career ==
Motson joined the BBC in 1968 as a sports presenter on Radio 2. His first radio commentary was for a football match between Everton and Derby County in December 1969. In October 1971, he began appearing as a regular commentator with the BBC television programme &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, his first commentary being a 0–0 draw between Liverpool and Chelsea.

On 5 February 1972, Motson had what he later described as his big breakthrough, when he was assigned to cover an FA Cup replay between Hereford United and Newcastle United for &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. Newcastle were expected to win easily, but Hereford won in a huge upset. Motson&#x27;s commentary when Ronnie Radford scored the equalising goal was &quot;Oh what a goal! Radford the scorer. Ronnie Radford! And the crowd are invading the pitch. What a tremendous shot by Ronnie Radford.&quot; Motson later described this match as the story of the season. His commentary caused BBC executives to assign him higher-profile TV matches, and he subsequently signed a three-year contract with the broadcaster.

Motson&#x27;s first FA Cup Final as a commentator was the 1977 match between Manchester United and Liverpool. Motson was drafted in as a late replacement for David Coleman, who was in a contractual dispute with the BBC. When Martin Buchan of Manchester United climbed the steps of Wembley Stadium to receive the trophy, Motson commented that it was &quot;fitting that a man called Buchan should be the first to climb the 39 steps&quot;, referring to the novel &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; by Scottish author John Buchan. Between 1979 and 2008 (except 1995 and 1996), Motson commentated on all the FA Cup finals that the BBC covered. In total, Motson covered 29 FA Cup finals.

The BBC stopped broadcasting &quot;Match of the Day&quot; in 1985 amid an increased appetite for live football rather than highlights, and ITV securing the rights to broadcast the English Football League. Motson continued to commentate regularly, however, as the BBC covered midweek fixtures in European tournaments, and he remained a principal commentator when the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; show returned in 1992 following the launch of the Premier League.

In April 1989, Motson commentated on the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest when the Hillsborough disaster occurred. Motson found himself commentating on a tragedy rather than a football match, and he later appeared as a witness at the Hillsborough inquiry.

The BBC lost the right to broadcast Premier League highlights to ITV in 2001, meaning &quot;Match of the Day&quot; was no longer a weekly schedule fixture. Motson returned to BBC Radio 5 Live for its coverage of the Premier League, although he still commentated for TV for games in which the BBC held rights to. &quot;Match of the Day&quot; resumed broadcasting the Premier League again in 2004 and returned with it, although he still occasionally commentated for 5 Live up to 2018.

In 2001, speech therapist Jane Comins conducted a voice profile analysis to study the patterns of eight top television and radio commentators. The criteria included pitch, volume, rhythm, and tone, and Comins found that Motson scored the best results. In an accompanying survey of football fans, 32% voted him Britain&#x27;s favourite commentator.
The BBC lost the rights to cover live FA Cup football in 2008 to Setanta Sports and ITV. Motson attempted to join Setanta, but the BBC refused permission, so he retired from live television commentary. His last live television broadcast was the Euro 2008 final. He continued to cover pre-recorded games for &quot;Match of the Day&quot; highlights.

Motson covered a total of 10 FIFA World Cups, beginning with the 1978 tournament. One of Motson&#x27;s memorable World Cup moments came in 1998, when Ronaldo was omitted from the official teamsheet presented to FIFA 72 minutes before the final, only to be later reinstated in a modified teamsheet. Motson described the scenes in Paris as &quot;absolute mayhem and chaos&quot;. His final World Cup was in 2010, when he travelled to South Africa as part of the BBC team and appeared as a studio guest on the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; highlights show, as well as providing reports on the BBC website. Beginning in 2015, Motson provided commentary and narration for the CBeebies football programme &quot;Footy Pups&quot;. He also covered 10 UEFA European Championships and a total of more than 200 England national team games.

Motson was a commentator for the FIFA video games series by EA Sports, and worked alongside Ally McCoist, Andy Gray, Des Lynam, Mark Lawrenson and Chris Waddle. Motson first joined the franchise for &quot;FIFA 96&quot;; he and McCoist were replaced by Gray and Clive Tyldesley for &quot;FIFA 06&quot; but later returned for &quot;FIFA Manager 08&quot;.

In September 2017, Motson announced that he would retire from the BBC at the end of the football season. His last live radio commentary was on a match between Arsenal and Watford on 11 March 2018. His final pre-recorded TV commentary was a match between Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion and was broadcast on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; on 13 May 2018.

During the 2018–19 season, Motson appeared in advertisements for gambling company Football INDEX.

== Personal life ==
Motson married Anne Jobling in 1976. They lived in Little Brickhill in Buckinghamshire and had one son, Frederick (born 1986).

In 2012, he stated he was a supporter of Barnet.

Motson was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1996, during which he was surprised by Michael Aspel at a charity event. He also appeared on the BBC Radio 4 biographical programme &quot;Great Lives&quot; in 2007, in which he nominated Brian Clough as his &quot;great life&quot;. On 19 May 2018, BBC Two celebrated Motson&#x27;s career with an evening featuring three special programmes – &quot;Motty Mastermind&quot;, &quot;Motty – The Man Behind the Sheepskin&quot; and &quot;Countdown to the Full Motty&quot;.

Motson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 Birthday Honours for services to sports broadcasting. He died in his sleep on 23 February 2023, at the age of 77. He had been suffering from bowel cancer since 2014, but whether or not that condition was related to his death has never been confirmed.

<text>The Betrayal of America is a book by Vincent Bugliosi (Thunder&#x27;s Mouth Press, 2001, ) which is largely based on an article he wrote for &quot;The Nation&quot; entitled &quot;None Dare Call It Treason&quot;, which argues that the US Supreme Court&#x27;s December 12, 2000, 5–4 decision in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; unlawfully handed the 2000 U.S. presidential election to George W. Bush. Bugliosi declares that the decision damaged both the US Constitution and democracy in general. He accuses the five majority judges of moral culpability by endangering Americans&#x27; constitutional freedoms.

<doc id="1107677" wikidata="Q1474738" url="?curid=1107677" title="Princes Motorway">
<text>Princes Motorway is a predominantly dual carriage untolled motorway that links Sydney to Wollongong and further south through the Illawarra region to . Part of the Australian Highway 1 network, the motorway is designated route M1. 

The motorway is sometimes known by its previous signposting F6 (Freeway Route 6) and its previous name Southern Freeway, which applied to the sections between Waterfall and Bulli Tops as well as Gwynneville and Yallah. The section between Bulli Tops and Gwynneville was known as Mount Ousley Road, and was first built as a defence route and later upgraded to dual carriageway standards.

It is the backbone of road traffic in the Illawarra. As Wollongong and Port Kembla are important industrial centres, freight traffic is heavy. Despite the current decline of the local steel industry, emergence of Wollongong as a commuter city of Sydney has kept the motorway busy.

==Route==

In the north, Princes Motorway commences at the interchange with Princes Highway at Waterfall and heads south as a four-lane, dual-carriageway road, taking more or less a parallel route with Princes Highway until the sprawling interchange with Appin Road and Princes Highway at Bulli Tops. It continues downhill, avoiding the steep Bulli Pass, and bypasses Wollongong CBD, through Gwynneville and continues for , bypassing the suburbs of Yallah and Albion Park Rail, reaching the interchange with Illawarra Highway (Terry Street) at Albion Park, before terminating with the existing alignment of Princes Highway at an interchange in Oak Flats.

==History==
The motorway can be divided into four sections, from north to south:
*Northern section, between Waterfall and Bulli Tops (formerly Southern Freeway)
*Central section, between Bulli Tops and Gwynneville (also known as Mount Ousley Road)
*Southern section, between Gwynneville to Yallah (formerly Southern Freeway)
*Albion Park Rail Bypass

===Northern section (Waterfall to Bulli Tops)===
Construction of the section between Waterfall and Bulli Tops commenced in July 1970. At 22.9km, it was then the longest section of freeway to completed at one time, at a cost of $30.5 million; it opened as Southern Freeway on 24 July 1975, and was allocated Freeway Route F6 (which later allowed it to be locally known as the &quot;F6 Freeway&quot;). Financed by State Government bonds, this section of freeway initially incurred a toll from its opening. This part of the freeway did not feature the Helensburgh Interchange (which subsequently opened in February 2000). The toll operated for 20 years: this was 10 years short of its intended operating length, due to local residents complaining that the F3 Freeway had its toll dropped in 1988 (which was at the time intended to be dropped as its loans had been fully paid off, unlike those of the F6). After much pressure, the tolls were eventually removed on 30 July 1995, when the loans had been repaid. Remnants of the tollbooths could initially be seen at the old toll plaza at Waterfall, such as faint markings and a set of warning lights in the southbound direction for the toll plaza. These remnants have since been removed. However, , the widened carriageways for the toll booths can still be seen at .

To complement the tollway, the dual carriageways of Princes Highway from Waterfall north to Loftus and the Sutherland bypass were constructed and opened to traffic on 16 September 1975.

===Central section (Mount Ousley Road)===
The section between Bulli Tops and Gwynneville was previously named as part of Mount Ousley Road, and is still often referred to as such. Mount Ousley Road was built in 1942 as a defence route, involving the reconstruction of part of a 19th century route from Bulli Tops to the Picton-Mt Keira road (the southern section not incorporated into the defence route is Clive Bissell Drive), and the construction of a new section of road to descend the escarpment and terminate at Princes Highway at North Wollongong (the easternmost 3.5 km of Picton Road, from Mount Keira Road to Mount Ousley Road, was also constructed as part of this project).

From the 1960s to the 1980s Mount Ousley Road was gradually upgraded, initially by the construction of overtaking lanes, then the staged extension of the overtaking lanes to ultimately provide continuous two lanes in each direction, and a third lane northbound from the foot of Mount Ousley to Clive Bissell Drive and a third southbound lane from Clive Bissell Drive to New Mount Pleasant Road. This was followed by deviations to replace sharp curves on steep gradients on the northern approach to Bellambi Creek and both approaches to Cataract Creek. A continuous Jersey median was subsequently installed in stages. Extensive truck management measures were also installed on the long, steep descent from Clive Bissell Drive into Wollongong during the 1980s, following a number of fatal truck crashes on this section.

The Mount Ousley Road section of Princes Motorway is sometimes not considered part of the freeway proper, as it is not built to full freeway standards, containing left-in/left-out intersections and the at-grade intersection at the foot of Mount Ousley, where the motorway proper diverges from Mount Ousley Road. This intersection is proposed to be replaced by a grade-separated interchange: the federal government announced funding for the interchange in May 2021, relocation of utility services is underway, and major construction is expected to start in 2024.

In November 2015, it was announced that the section between Bulli Tops and Picton Road would have a third lane added in each direction. , detailed design works have been completed.

===Southern section (Gwynneville to Yallah)===
The construction of the first stage of Princes Motorway between Gwynneville and Yallah commenced in May 1959. This formed the majority of what was built as a north-south bypass of Wollongong central business district, and was the first section built of the Northern Distributor, an arterial road planned to run from Thirroul in the north to Dapto in the south. The CBD bypass was opened from Princes Highway at North Wollongong to Foley Street in December 1959, from Foley Street to Phillips Avenue in 1961 and from Phillips Avenue to Princes Highway at West Wollongong in July 1963. Duplication of the Northern Distributor from Gwynneville to West Wollongong was completed in 1965. The Northern Distributor was allocated as Freeway Route F8 in 1974, extended further north from the 1980s, and renamed Memorial Drive in 2010.

In March 1964 a connector road from Mount Ousley Road at the foot of Mount Ousley to the Northern Distributor in Gwynneville was opened as single carriageway road, and was duplicated in the early 1970s. The intersection with the Northern Distributor was later reconstructed to a grade-separated interchange, beginning in April 1996 and opening in December 1998.

Following completion of the Mount Ousley-Gwynneville connector, Southern Freeway subsumed a section of the Northern Distributor south of Gwynneville to West Wollongong, and continued making its way southward, then with the extension from West Wollongong to The Avenue at Figtree opening in 1967, and then from Five Islands Road to Northcliffe Drive in 1973 (albeit as a single carriageway, with duplication finished in 1975). The intermediate section from The Avenue to Five Islands Road, including the interchange with Masters Road, was opened in 1975; this section was also allocated Freeway Route F6 (which also allowed it to be locally known as the &quot;F6 Freeway&quot;) in 1974. Construction then continued south from Northcliffe Drive to Kanahooka Road in 1978 (with duplication concluding in 1979), to Fowlers Road in 1981 (with duplication concluding in 1983), to Princes Highway near Tallawarra power station in 1986 (with duplication concluding in 1987), and to Yallah (in conjunction with grade separation of the junction with Princes Highway) in 1989.

===As Princes Motorway===
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB). With the subsequent passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, the Department of Main Roads (having succeeded the MRB in 1932) declared Southern Freeway as a motorway (under plan number 6006), on 8 October 1975, and was re-declared to cover each extension until it reached its southern terminus in Yallah; the motorway today still retains this declaration (under Motorway 6006).

Freeway Route F6 was allocated to the southern section of Southern Freeway in 1973, and along the entire northern section when it opened in 1975: as new sections of the freeway opened, Freeway Route F6 was extended along these new sections, but had already begun to be phased out in the mid-1908s to be replaced by National Route 1, and had disappeared by 1992; the Mount Ousley Road section was designated part of National Route 1 from 1975. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, National Route 1 was replaced with route M1, and Southern Freeway and Mount Ousley Road were officially renamed as M1 Princes Motorway.

===Albion Park Rail Bypass===
At the southern end, Princes Motorway was extended to Oak Flats via a 9.8 km bypass of Albion Park Rail. The bypass completed the &#x27;missing link&#x27; in the four-lane road between Sydney and Berry (since extended to Bomaderry/Nowra), and was constructed on a corridor which was identified by the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority in a study in the mid 1990s. In 2013, Roads and Maritime Services (successor to the RTA) confirmed the reserved corridor to be suitable for the bypass.

The bypass was completed on 9 October 2021, several months ahead of schedule. The section of the bypass between Yallah and the Illawarra Highway (Terry Street) interchange was opened to traffic in May 2021. The northbound carriageway of the remainder of the bypass (ie north from the New Lake Entrance Road interchange to the Illawarra Highway interchange) opened to traffic on 7 August 2021. The remainder of the southbound carriageway was opened to traffic on 9 October 2021, thereby completing the bypass.

== Proposed extensions ==
===Northern extension===

The County of Cumberland planning scheme of 1948 outlined an F6 extension from the current-day end-point at Waterfall. As such, an F6 corridor was set aside that passes through the Royal National Park from Waterfall to Campbell Road in St Peters. The land reservation tract currently passes through the suburbs of Loftus, Kirrawee, Gymea, Miranda, Taren Point, Sandringham, Sans Souci, Ramsgate, Monterey, Kogarah, Brighton-Le-Sands, Rockdale, Banksia, Arncliffe, Kyeemagh and Tempe.

Of the proposed extension, only the six-lane Captain Cook Bridge and a short connecting section of Taren Point Road to the south have been built. Establishment of the bridge section of the F6 extension began in 1962, expedited to replace the ferry service that had operated from Taren Point to Sans Souci since 1916. Captain Cook Bridge was opened in May 1965.

In the original plan, the F6 would have connected to the Western Distributor. Then, in August 1977, premier Neville Wran cancelled the inner section of the F6 link, which at the time had an estimated construction cost of $96 million. At the same time, Wran announced that the inner section reservation would be sold off and the proposed extension would instead terminate at St Peters, a medium density industrial suburb.

Prior to the 2007 federal election, the Liberal–Nationals (Coalition) government promised to allocate $20 million towards planning for the F6 extension. Although the Coalition lost the 2007 election, the funding was once again promised at the subsequent 2010 federal election. This funding would ensure the project is &quot;shovel ready&quot; when funding becomes available.

In the mid 2010s, the F6 extension project was revived under the Liberal–National coalition state government. This project has since been renamed M6 Motorway.

<doc id="1107685" wikidata="Q195161" url="?curid=1107685" title="Haustorium">
<text>In botany and mycology, a haustorium (plural haustoria) is a rootlike structure that grows into or around another structure to absorb water or nutrients. For example, in mistletoe or members of the broomrape family, the structure penetrates the host&#x27;s tissue and draws nutrients from it. In mycology, it refers to the appendage or portion of a parasitic fungus (the hyphal tip), which performs a similar function. Microscopic haustoria penetrate the host plant&#x27;s cell wall and siphon nutrients from the space between the cell wall and plasma membrane but do not penetrate the membrane itself. Larger (usually botanical, not fungal) haustoria do this at the tissue level.

The etymology of the name corresponds to the Latin word &quot;haustor&quot; meaning &quot;the one who draws, drains or drinks&quot;, and refers to the action performed by the outgrowth.

==In fungi==
Fungi in all major divisions form haustoria. Haustoria take several forms. Generally, on penetration, the fungus increases the surface area in contact with host plasma membrane releasing enzymes that break up the cell walls, enabling greater potential movement of organic carbon from host to fungus. Thus, an insect hosting a parasitic fungus such as &quot;Cordyceps&quot; may look as though it is being &quot;eaten from the inside out&quot; as the haustoria expand inside of it.

The simplest forms of haustoria are small spheres. The largest are complex formations adding significant mass to a cell, expanding between the cell wall and cell membrane. In the &quot;Chytridiomycota&quot;, the entire fungus may become enclosed in the cell, and it is arguable whether this should be considered analogous to a haustorium.

Haustoria arise from intercellular hyphae, appressoria, or external hyphae. The hypha narrows as it passes through the cell wall and then expands on invaginating the cell. A thickened, electron-dense collar of material is deposited around the hypha at the point of invagination. Further, the host cell wall becomes highly modified in the invaginated zone. Inclusions normally present in plasma membrane are absent, and the outer layer contains more polysaccharide. The wall of both partners is severely reduced.

Functional exchange takes place within the haustorial complex. The host supplies organic carbon to the fungus, and the metabolic activity within the complex is considerably greater than outside. Carbon from the host is absorbed by the fungus, and transported to the rest of the thallus. The host plant appears to be functioning according to signals from the fungus and the complex appears to be under the control of the invader.

The haustorium may be mycelium or root-shaped.

==In plants==
Mistletoes (including Loranthaceae and Viscaceae) attach to their hosts via a haustorium. The haustoria attacks the host&#x27;s xylem and/or phloem and attaches itself to the host. This structure both anchors the mistletoe, and taps into the host plant. Mistletoes use passive mechanisms to draw water from their hosts. They keep their leaf stomata open night and day which sets up a moisture gradient between mistletoe and host.

A second meaning of &#x27;haustorium&#x27; in botany is to describe tissues in a developing plant embryo that transfer nutrients from the seed&#x27;s endosperm to the embryo. These tissues are found widely in the seeds of flowering plants.

<doc id="1107686" wikidata="Q1305285" url="?curid=1107686" title="A Dream Play">
<text>A Dream Play (), sometimes staged in English as The Dream Play, is a fantasy play in 14 scenes written in 1901 by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg. It was published in Swedish in 1902 and first performed in Stockholm on 17 April 1907. It remains one of Strindberg&#x27;s most admired and influential dramas, seen as an important precursor to both dramatic Expressionism and Surrealism.

==Plot==

The primary character in the play is Agnes, a daughter of the Vedic god Indra. She descends to Earth to bear witness to problems of human beings. She meets about 40 characters, some of them having a clearly symbolical value (such as four deans representing theology, philosophy, medicine, and law) and is herself enmeshed in a wrenching marriage. After experiencing all sorts of human suffering (for example poverty, cruelty, and the routine of family life), the daughter of gods realizes that human beings are to be pitied. Only the Poet, who has created the dream, seems unaffected by human suffering. Finally, she returns to Heaven and this moment corresponds to the awakening from a dream-like sequence of events.

==Interpretations==
The use of a dream to represent a setting in a theatrical work appealed to the traditionally realist author in that Strindberg expresses realistic concerns such as materialism, class struggle, gender role struggle, and the destruction of traditional marriage in (as stated in the preface) &quot;the disconnected but apparently logical form of a dream. Everything can happen; everything is possible and likely.&quot;

The play itself represents a change in his style, one that would have widespread influence on the development of modernist drama. Eschewing realism, Strindberg explained that he had modeled his play, not on the pattern of cause and effect that had characterized the well-made play, but on the associative links found in dreams. Locales dissolve and give way to each other; time both moves forward and backward. During the course of the play, a castle grows up in the garden, as if it were a plant. At the play&#x27;s end, it burns, revealing a wall of suffering and despairing faces, then blossoms at its top in a huge chrysanthemum.

A description of the play&#x27;s style can be found in Strindberg&#x27;s prefatory note:The characters split, double, multiply, evaporate, condense, dissolve and merge. But one consciousness rules them all: the dreamer&#x27;s; for him there are no secrets, no inconsistencies, no scruples and no laws.  He does not judge or acquit, he merely relates; and because a dream is usually painful rather than pleasant, a tone of melancholy and compassion for all living creatures permeates the rambling narrative.:12The play itself does not center around a single well-defined individual, but rather simply follows someone who seems to be a combination of different professional men, all confused. The feminine foil to these men is Indra&#x27;s Daughter, a Christ-like figure. She was played in the original production by Harriet Bosse, Strindberg&#x27;s ex-wife.:59

==Psychology of the author==
Strindberg wrote it following a near-psychotic episode. During that time, he came to be extremely disturbed, thinking witches were attempting to murder him. He later wrote a memoir about this period of his life. Eventually, though, he recovered, thanks to his mother-in-law.

Previously, Strindberg had seen himself as a martyr, constantly persecuted by women. This affected his view of the overall relationship between the sexes, and of course his writing. He finally realized that he was playing a part in his failed relationships after his third marriage to Bosse collapsed. Bosse was behind the main character of &quot;A Dream Play&quot;.

The play, called by Strindberg &quot;the child of my greatest pain,&quot; reflects the author&#x27;s observation that life is an illusion, similar to a dream.

==Notable productions==

The world premiere of &quot;A Dream Play&quot; was performed at The Swedish Theatre in April 1907, six years after it was written. Harriet Bosse, Strindberg&#x27;s third wife (divorced by this time) played Indra&#x27;s daughter. Victor Castegren directed the production and Carl Grabow was the designer. Critics at the time noted that the demands of the play made it nearly impossible to mount a satisfactory production. Strindberg himself desired to re-stage it in his Intimate Theatre, but ultimately it was not successful.

Max Reinhardt directed one of the most influential versions of the play. First staged in 1921 at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Stockholm,:38 later that year he mounted a more famous production at Berlin&#x27;s Deutsches Theater. The New York premiere of the play was directed by James Light for performance by the Provincetown Players at the Provincetown Playhouse in 1926 under the title &quot;The Dream Play&quot;.

The play afterward attracted some of the 20th century&#x27;s most celebrated directors, including , Olof Molander, Antonin Artaud, Ingmar Bergman, Roger Blin, Robert Wilson, Mike Dempsey, Robert Lepage and Alejandro Jodorowsky. The German director Knut Ström staged &quot;A Dream Play&quot; in Düsseldorf in 1918, co-directed with Paul Henkels.

Ingmar Bergman staged the play three times, filming the first production for TV in 1963. At the end of Bergman’s film &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (1982), Emilie Ekdahl, the new manager of the town’s dramatic theatre, declares that she will immediately mount Strindberg’s &quot;Dream Play&quot;, with herself and Helena Ekdahl (her mother-in-law) playing principal parts. Handed Strindberg’s playscript, and concluding the film, Helena reads aloud to her grandson, Alexander: “Everything can happen. Everything is possible and probable. Time and space do not exist. On a flimsy framework of reality, the imagination spins, weaving new patterns.”

An edited version by Caryl Churchill was staged at the National Theatre in London in 2005. The edited version was brought to other areas too, such as Edge Theatre Ensemble in Seattle and Jobsite Theater in Tampa, and was brought to Sheffield&#x27;s Drama Studio in February 2012.

A new adaptation by Emma Reay was performed at Oxford Playhouse in 2011. &quot;Dreamplay: Asian Boys Vol. 1&quot;, playwright Alfian Sa&#x27;at&#x27;s loose adaptation, premiered in Singapore in 2000 and was re-staged in 2014.

<text>Vladimir Pavlovich Muravyov () (born 30 September 1959 in Karaganda, Kazakh SSR) is a former Soviet track and field athlete who competed in the sprints. He was the winner of two gold medals in 4×100 m relay at the Olympic Games. He was also three times Soviet champion outdoors, and two times indoor champion.

At the 1980 Summer Olympics, Vladimir Muravyov was sixth in the 100 metres final, but went out in the heats of the 200 metres, but he ran the opening leg in the Soviet 4×100 m relay team, which won the gold medal. At the 1982 European Championships, Muravyov was seventh in 200 m. At the first World Championships he reached the semifinal in 200 m and was a member of Soviet 4×100 m relay team, which won the bronze.

Muravyov missed the 1984 Summer Olympics due to the boycott. In 1985 he was second behind Poland&#x27;s Marian Woronin in the European Cup, but went on to win the relay, but was sixth at the 1985 IAAF World Cup in 200 m and third in 4×100 m relay. He won the gold medal at the 1986 European Championships as a member of Soviet 4×100 m relay team.

At the 1987 World Championships, Muravyov was eliminated in the quarterfinal of 100 m, but was second with the Soviet 4×100 m relay team. At the 1988 Summer Olympics, Muravyov was again in the Soviet 4×100 m relay team, which, in the absence of United States, which was disqualified in the heats, won the gold medal.

<text>Angus Lindsay Wright (1945- Oct 21, 2022) was professor emeritus and one of the founders of the Environmental Studies program at California State University, Sacramento, where he taught from 1972 to 2005. (Wes Jackson was another of the founders.)

Wright earned his Ph.D. in Latin American History from the University of Michigan in 1976 with a dissertation on &quot;Market, Land and Class: Southern Bahia, Brazil, 1890–1942.&quot; He conducted research in Mexico and Brazil with the support of Fulbright and Doherty Research grants.

Wright&#x27;s first book was &quot;The Death of Ramon Gonzalez: The Modern Agricultural Dilemma&quot; (University of Texas Press, 1990). This book is available in an updated, second edition, published in 2005 by the University of Texas Press.

Wright is the co-author of &quot;To Inherit the Earth: The Landless Movement and the Struggle for a New Brazil&quot;, published in 2003 by Food First!. He joined ecologists Ivette Perfecto and John Vandermeer of the University of Michigan to write &quot;Nature&#x27;s Matrix: Linking Conservation, Agriculture, and Food Sovereignty&quot;, published in 2009 by Earthscan Press of London, available in a second edition as of 2019. He also wrote numerous articles on environmental history and the social and environmental consequences of agriculture and of property ownership in the Americas.

Wright served as president and board member of the &quot;Pesticide Action Network North America&quot; and the &quot;Institute for Food and Development Policy &quot;(Food First) and was chairman of the Board of The Land Institute from 2009 to 2017, and a member of the Board from 1993 to 2019. As a member of the &quot;Investigative Mechanism&quot; (an independent citizen review board) of the Inter-American Development Bank, he coordinated a study of Latin America&#x27;s largest hydroelectric plant, Yacyreta. He lectured frequently at universities around the United States. From 2005 through 2007 he served as a lead author on the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development, sponsored by the United Nations, the World Bank, and a variety of other institutions and organizations and now available in various forms from Island Press.

His wife Mary Mackey is a fellow CSU Sacramento academic, poet and novelist.

<text>Lyons-la-Forêt () is a commune of the Eure department, Normandy, in northwest France. Lyons-la-Forêt has distinctive historical geography, and architecture, and contemporary culture, as a consequence of the Forest of Lyons, and its bocage, and of the adjacent Pays de Bray. It is a member of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (The Most Beautiful Villages of France) Association.

==Geography==
Lyons-la-Forêt is located from Rouen and from Gisors.
Former name: Saint-Denis-en-Lyons.

Lyons was originally the name of the forest &quot;Licontio-/Ligontio-&quot;, based probably on the Celtic root &quot;lic&quot;/&quot;lig&quot;, that is also found in the name of the stream: la Lieure &quot;Licoris /Ligoris&quot;. Same root as the river Loire &lt; &quot;Liger&quot; and &quot;-ley&quot; in Beverley (Yorkshire) from Celtic &gt; Old English beaver, stream.

==History==
An early mention of a ducal residence in Lyons can be found in 936, when William I, Duke of Normandy used to stay. The castle of Lyons-la-Forêt was constructed at the start of the 12th century by Henry I of England, also known as &quot;Henri Beauclerc&quot;. He died there in 1135, supposedly from &quot;a surfeit of lampreys&quot;.

The town and the castle were occupied by King Philip II Augustus of France in 1193 but the following year, Richard I of England, back from captivity, obtained the restitution of Lyons; the king of England and Duke of Normandy stayed frequently until 1198. In 1202, Philip II Augustus re-conquered the city, and after him, several French kings were attracted by the Lyons forest and the good hunting grounds.

From 1359 to 1398, the castellan domain of Lyons was part of Blanche de Navarre&#x27;s dower after she became the widow of King Philip VI of France. In 1403–1422, it was the dower of Isabeau de Bavière, wife of King Charles. In 1419, in the course of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the English took Lyons.

During the Second World War, the area was used for parachute drops of agents F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas and André Dewavrin.

* Castle of Henry I of England (private property)
* Covered market place (18th century)
* Church Saint-Denis (12th and 18th centuries)
* Town hall (17th century)
* Houses built in typical Normandy style (17th and 18th centuries)
* The forest is 10,700 hectares, the largest state forest in Normandy and one of the largest Beech forests in Europe. It is renowned for the &quot;cathedral-like&quot; straightness and height of its trees&#x27; trunks. One of its characteristics is its numerous open spaces and clearings among which lie small villages and hamlets. This makes a transition between the Vexin plateau and the Andelle valley.

==Personalities==

* Henry I of England died on 1 December 1135 of food poisoning from eating &quot;a surfeit of lampreys&quot; (of which he was excessively fond) at Lyons-la-Forêt (then Saint-Denis-en-Lyons). The mucus and serum of several lamprey species, including the Caspian lamprey (&quot;Caspiomyzon wagneri&quot;), river lamprey (&quot;Lampetra fluviatilis&quot; and &quot;L. planeri&quot;), and sea lamprey (&quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;), are known to be toxic and require thorough cleaning before cooking and consumption.
*Lyons-la-Forêt was the birthplace of Enguerrand de Marigny (1260–1315), chamberlain and minister of Philip IV the Fair.
*It was also the birthplace of Isaac de Benserade, French poet (1612–1691), who was one of the first intellectuals in France to evoke female homosexuality in a theater play.
*Maurice Ravel stayed in Lyons many times from 1917 to 1922. He wrote music including &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot; in Le Fresne, one of the old mansions of Lyons-la-Forêt.
*Monique de La Bruchollerie (1915 – 1972), the classical concert pianist, lived there all her life with her family.
*Gérard Souzay (1918 – 2004), the French baritone, lived there for a while during the Second World War, at la Fontaineresse, on the banks of the Lieure.
*Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann (1879 – 1933) was a renowned French designer of furniture and interiors. His house is described in several publications concerning his life and work.
*The artist Paul-Émile Pissarro (the youngest son of Camille Pissarro) lived here for some years from 1922, when he bought a house and had the garden designed by his godfather, Claude Monet.

<doc id="1107703" wikidata="Q5051574" url="?curid=1107703" title="Catastrophic failure">
<text>A catastrophic failure is a sudden and total failure from which recovery is impossible. Catastrophic failures often lead to cascading systems failure. The term is most commonly used for structural failures, but has often been extended to many other disciplines in which total and irrecoverable loss occurs, such as a head crash occurrence on a hard disk drive.

For example, catastrophic failure can be observed in steam turbine rotor failure, which can occur due to peak stress on the rotor; stress concentration increases up to a point at which it is excessive, leading ultimately to the failure of the disc.

In firearms, catastrophic failure usually refers to a rupture or disintegration of the barrel or receiver of the gun when firing it. Some possible causes of this are an out-of-battery gun, an inadequate headspace, the use of incorrect ammunition, the use of ammunition with an incorrect propellant charge, a partially or fully obstructed barrel, or weakened metal in the barrel or receiver. A failure of this type, known colloquially as a &quot;kaboom&quot;, or &quot;kB&quot; failure, can pose a threat not only to the user(s) but even many bystanders.

In chemical engineering, a reaction which undergoes thermal runaway can cause catastrophic failure.

It can be difficult to isolate the cause or causes of a catastrophic failure from other damage that occurred during the failure, forensic engineering and failure analysis are used to find and analyse these causes.

==Examples==

Examples of catastrophic failure of engineered structures include:
* The Tay Rail Bridge disaster of 1879, where the center of the bridge was completely destroyed while a train was crossing in a storm. The bridge was inadequately designed and its replacement was built as a separate structure upstream of the old.
* The failure of the South Fork Dam in 1889 released 4.8 billion US gallons (18 billion litres) of water and killed over 2,200 people (popularly known as the Johnstown Flood).
* The collapse of the St. Francis Dam in 1928 released 12.4 billion US gallons (47 billion litres) of water, resulting in a death toll of nearly 600 people.
* The collapse of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge of 1940, where the main deck of the road bridge was totally destroyed by dynamic oscillations in a wind.
* The De Havilland Comet disasters of 1954, later determined to be structural failures due to greater metal fatigue than anticipated at the corners of windows.
* The 62 Banqiao Dams failure event in China in 1975, due to Typhoon Nina. Approximately 86,000 people died from flooding and another 145,000 died from subsequent diseases, a total of 231,000 deaths.
* The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse of 1981, where a suspended walkway in a hotel lobby in Kansas City, Missouri, collapsed completely, killing over 100 people on and below the structure.
* The Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of 1986, in which an O-ring of a rocket booster failed, causing the external fuel tank to break up and making the shuttle veer off course, subjecting it to aerodynamic forces beyond design tolerances; the entire crew of 7 and vehicle were lost.
* The nuclear reactor at the Chernobyl power plant, which exploded in April 26, 1986 causing the release of a substantial amount of radioactive materials.
* The collapse of the Warsaw radio mast of 1991, which had up to that point held the title of world&#x27;s tallest structure.
* The Sampoong Department Store collapse of 1995, which happened due to structural weaknesses, killed 502 people and injured 937.
* The terrorist attacks and subsequent fire at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, weakened the floor joists to the point of catastrophic failure.
* The Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster of 2003, where damage to a wing during launch resulted in total loss upon re-entry.
* The collapse of the multi-span I-35W Mississippi River bridge on August 1, 2007.
* The collapse of the Olivos-Tezonco Mexico City Metro overpass of 2021, which had structurally weakened over the years.

<doc id="1107715" wikidata="Q6504006" url="?curid=1107715" title="Lawrence Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland">
<text>Lawrence John Lumley Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland (11 June 1876 – 6 February 1961), styled Lord Dundas until 1892 and Earl of Ronaldshay between 1892 and 1929, was a British hereditary peer and Conservative politician. An expert on India, he served as Secretary of State for India in the late 1930s.

==Early life and education==
Zetland was born in London in 1876, the eldest surviving son of Lawrence Dundas, 1st Marquess of Zetland, and his wife Lady Lilian Selena Elizabeth Lumley, daughter of Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough. He was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was a member of the University Pitt Club.

==Political career==

Lord Ronaldshay was commissioned a lieutenant in the North Riding of York Volunteer Artillery. He was on 3 April 1900 appointed an extra aide-de-camp to Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India. While working for Curzon in the British Raj, Ronaldshay travelled widely through Asia, having experiences which would later inform his fictional and non-fictional writing.

Zetland was returned to Parliament for Hornsey in 1907, a seat he held until 1916. Much of his public career centred on British India. In September 1912, he was appointed (with Lord Islington, Herbert Fisher, Mr Justice Abdur Rahim, and others) as a member of the Royal Commission on the Public Services in India of 1912–1915. He was Governor of Bengal between 1917 and 1922 and Secretary of State for India between 1935 and 1940. Although a member of the Conservative Party, his belief was that Indians should be allowed to take ever-increasing responsibility for the government of the country, culminating in Dominion status (enjoyed by Canada, Australia, and other formerly self-governing parts of the British Empire).

Zetland played an important role in the protracted negotiations which led to the Government of India Act 1935, which began, subject to the implacable opposition of Winston Churchill and the &quot;diehards&quot; to anything that might imperil direct British rule over India, to implement those ideals.
Zetland was also an author: Rab Butler, who served as his Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the India Office, records that he asked how he could understand better his chief&#x27;s thinking about the future of India and received the answer: &quot;Read my books!&quot; Zetland kept Butler, who had helped to pass the Government of India Act and had enjoyed great influence under Zetland&#x27;s predecessor Samuel Hoare, at arm&#x27;s length, requiring him to book an appointment in advance if he wanted to see him. Butler continued to serve under him for another two years, but devotes only a single paragraph to this period in his memoirs.

Zetland was ideally placed as Secretary of State for India to implement the new Act, although the two Viceroys with whom he served, Lords Willingdon and Linlithgow, were rather less idealistic than he. In the event, Willingdon and Linlithgow were proved right when the Congress Party won the 1937 Provincial elections, much to the dismay of Zetland. Zetland&#x27;s term as Secretary of State — and the experiment with democracy represented by the 1935 Act — came to an end with Churchill&#x27;s assumption of the Prime Ministership in 1940: Zetland then offered his resignation, feeling that his ideas and Churchill&#x27;s regarding India were so different that &quot;I could only end by becoming an embarrassment to him.&quot; Two months prior to this, on 13 March 1940, Zetland was one of four people shot at the Caxton Hall by Indian nationalist Udham Singh; former lieutenant governor of the Punjab, Michael O&#x27;Dwyer, was killed. Zetland suffered only bruising to his ribs (the bullet was found in his clothes) and was able to take his seat in the House of Lords five days later.

Zetland, who was known to favour good relations between the UK and Germany, was associated with the Anglo-German Fellowship during the late 1930s.

Zetland was sworn of the Privy Council in 1922 and made a Knight of the Garter in 1942. He also bore the Sword of State at the coronation of George VI in 1937 and was Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire between 1945 and 1951. He was elected President of the Royal Geographical Society in 1922 and President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland for 1928–31. From 1932 to 1945, he was chairman of the National Trust.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Ronaldshay married on 3 December 1907 to Cicely Archdale (1886–1973), daughter of Mervyn Henry Archdale. They lived at Snelsmore at Chieveley in Berkshire, and had five children:
* Lawrence Aldred Mervyn Dundas, 3rd Marquess of Zetland (12 November 1908 - 5 October 1989)
* Lady Viola Mary Dundas (4 January 1910 - 21 March 1995)
* Lady Lavinia Margaret Dundas (31 December 1914 – 4 January 1974)
* Lady Jean Agatha Dundas (4 May 1916 – 13 May 1995), married on 2 September 1939 to Hector Lorenzo Christie.
* Flight Sergeant Lord Bruce Thomas Dundas (18 October 1920 – 24 February 1942), killed in action with the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.

==Death==
Lord Zetland died in 1961 at the age of 84 and was succeeded in the marquessate and other titles by his elder and only surviving son, Lawrence. The Marchioness of Zetland died in January 1973.

<text>Sir Charles Thomas Newton (16 September 1816 – 28 November 1894) was a British archaeologist. He was made KCB in 1887.

==Life==
He was born in 1816, the second son of Newton Dickinson Hand Newton, vicar of Clungunford, Shropshire, and afterwards of Bredwardine, Herefordshire.
He was educated at Shrewsbury School (then under Samuel Butler), and at Christ Church, Oxford (matriculating 17 Oct. 1833), where he graduated B.A. in 1837 and M.A. in 1840.
Already in his undergraduate days Newton (as his friend and contemporary, John Ruskin, tells in &quot;Præterita&quot;) was giving evidence of his natural bent; the scientific study of classical archaeology, which Winckelmann had set on foot in Germany, was in England to find its worthy apostle in Newton. In 1840, contrary to the wishes of his family, he entered the British Museum as an assistant in the department of antiquities. As a career the museum, as it then was, can have presented but few attractions to a young man; but the department, as yet undivided, probably offered to Newton a wider range of comparative study in his subject than he could otherwise have acquired.
In 1852, he was named vice-consul at Mytilene, and from April 1853 to January 1854 he was consul at Rhodes, with the definite duty, among others, of watching over the interests of the British Museum in the Levant.
In 1854 and 1855, with funds advanced by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, he carried on excavations in Kalymnos, enriching the British Museum with an important series of inscriptions, and in the following year he was at length enabled to undertake his long-cherished scheme of identifying the site, and recovering for this country the chief remains, of the mausoleum at Halicarnassus.

In 1856–1857, he achieved the great archaeological exploit of his life by the discovery of the remains of the mausoleum, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. He was greatly assisted by Murdoch Smith, afterwards celebrated in connection with Persian telegraphs. 
The results were described by Newton in his &quot;History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus&quot; (1862–1863), written in conjunction with R. P. Pullan, and in his &quot;Travels and Discoveries in the Levant&quot; (1865).
These works included particulars of other important discoveries, especially at Branchidae, where he disinterred the statues which had anciently lined the Sacred Way, and at Cnidos, where Pullan, acting under his direction, found the Lion of Knidos now in the British Museum.
In 1860, he was named consul at Rome, but was the following year recalled to take up the newly created post of keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum.
Newton&#x27;s keepership at the museum was marked by an amassing wealth of important acquisitions, which were largely attributable to his personal influence or initiation. Thus in the ten years 1864-74 alone he was enabled to purchase no less than five important collections of classical antiquities: the Farnese, the two great series of Castellani, the Pourtales, and the Blacas collections, representing in special grants upwards of £100,000. Meanwhile, his work in the Levant, bringing to the museum the direct results of exploration and research, was being continued by his successors and friends: Biliotti in Rhodes, Smith and Porcher at Gyrene, Lang in Cyprus, Dennis in Sicily, in the Cyrenaica, and around Smyrna, Pullan at Priene, John Turtle Wood at Ephesus were all working more or less directly under Newton on behalf of the museum.
Of his own work as a scholar in elucidating and editing the remains of antiquity, the list of his writings given below is only a slight indication; nor was this confined to writing alone. In 1855, he had been offered by Lord Palmerston (acting on Liddell&#x27;s advice) the regius professorship of Greek at Oxford, rendered vacant by Dean Gaisford&#x27;s death, with the definite object of creating a school of students in what was then a practically untried field of classical study at Oxford. 
The salary, however, was only nominal, and Newton was obliged to decline the post, which was then offered to and accepted by Benjamin Jowett. 
In 1880, however, the Yates chair of classical archaeology was created at University College, London, and by a special arrangement, Newton was enabled to hold it coincidentally with his museum appointment. 
As antiquary to the Royal Academy he lectured frequently. 
In the latter part of his career, he was closely associated with the work of three English societies, all of which owed to him more or less directly their inception and a large part of their success; the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, at the inaugural meeting of which he presided in June 1879; the British School at Athens, started in February 1885: and the Egypt Exploration Fund, which was founded in 1882.

In 1889, he was presented by his friends and pupils, under the presidency of the Earl of Carnarvon, with a testimonial in the form of a marble portrait bust of himself by Boehm, now deposited in the Mausoleum Room at the British Museum; the balance of the fund was by his own wish devoted to founding a studentship in connection with the British School at Athens. 
In 1885, he resigned the museum and academy appointments, and in 1888 he was compelled by increasing infirmity to give up the Yates professorship.

On 28 November 1894 he died at Margate, where he had moved from his residence, 2 Montague Place, Bedford Square. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

==Awards==
In 1874 Newton was made honorary fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, and on 9 June 1875 D.C.L. of the same university ; LL.D. of Cambridge, and PhD of Strasburg in 1879 ; Companion of the Bath (C.B.) on 16 November 1875, and Knight Commander of the same order (K.C.B.) on 21 June 1887. 
He was correspondent of the Institute of France, honorary director of the Archaeological Institute of Berlin, and honorary member of the Accademia dei Lincei of Rome.

==Family==
On 27 April 1861, he married the distinguished painter, Ann Mary, daughter of Joseph Severn, himself a painter and the friend of John Keats, who had succeeded Newton in Rome; she died in 1866 at their residence, 74 Gower Street, Bloomsbury.

==Works==
He was editor of the &quot;Collection of Ancient Greek Inscriptions in the British Museum&quot; (1874 &amp;c. fol.), and author of numerous other official publications of the British Museum ; also of a treatise on the &quot;Method of the Study of Ancient Art,&quot; 1850; a &quot;History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus, Cnidus, and Branchidse,&quot; 1862-3 ; &quot;Travels and Discoveries in the Levant&quot;, 1865 ; &quot;Essays on Art and Archæology,&quot; 1880 ; and of many papers in periodicals, among which may be specially noted a &quot;Memoir on the Mausoleum&quot; in the &quot;Classical Museum&quot; for 1847.

<doc id="1107734" wikidata="Q356099" url="?curid=1107734" title="Deschooling">
<text>Deschooling is a term invented by Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich. Today, the word is mainly used by homeschoolers, especially unschoolers, to refer to the transition process that children and parents go through when they leave the school system in order to start homeschooling. The process is a crucial basis for homeschooling to work. It involves children gradually transitioning away from their schoolday routine and institutional mentality, redeveloping the ability to learn via self-determination, and discovering what they want to learn in their first homeschool days.

The amount of time this process takes can vary, depending on the type of person the child is and how much time they spent in the school system. The process may affect the behavior of different children differently. Especially in the first days of deschooling, it is often the case that children mainly want to recover from the school surroundings and therefore will generally sleep very long and refuse any kind of intentional learning and instead search for substitute satisfactions like watching TV or playing video games, very similar to the behavior during early school holidays. Further in this transition process, children may feel bored or may miss the daily structure, until they eventually find out how to make use of their time and freedom to find interests. In the best case this results in them voluntarily informing themselves about certain things they are interested in, whereupon homeschooling can start.

This step is often considered a recreation stage or a process of healing from the school environment. Many followers of the modern homeschool movement consider this step necessary because the school system can damage the innate creativity, curiosity, and willingness to learn in children. They claim that in school most children only study under unnatural extrinsic pressure like grades, instead of for themselves, and that what, when, how, and with whom to learn is always predetermined instead of self-determinable there.

==Background==
Deschooling is credited to Ivan Illich, who felt that the traditional schooling children received needed to be reconstructed. Illich believed that schools contain a &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; that causes learning to align with grades and accreditation rather than with important skills. He believed that modern schooling is focused on growing schools as an industrialized system, a toxic industry that specializes in what families should be capable of forming themselves, namely education. According to Illich, schools align success on paper with academic excellence. As a result schools, grades, and diplomas give false assurances that the students have become knowledgeable in a certain educational concept.

John Holt was an educator who also believed in deschooling. His thoughts were closely aligned with Illich because neither were convinced that school was where students learned everything they needed to know. Instead, they emphasized that students learn consistently through other means, such as exposure to the natural world. Illich and Holt saw schools as being insufficient because of their focus on &quot;skill drill&quot; instead of other methods of learning. Additionally, theorists of deschooling saw education as maintaining the social order. Therefore, they wanted to &quot;denounce the monopoly that traditional education institutions held on education and learning.&quot;

==Unschooling/deschooling society==
&quot;Deschooling&quot; a person does not mean prohibiting people from learning or studying in schools. In Illich and Holt&#x27;s unschooled society everybody would have the choice of whether they attend school. Rather than being forced to go to school, taking a test before entering a school, or being denied the opportunity to learn a desired topic, people would be free to choose how they learn. According to John Holt, an advocate for unschooling, &quot;a deschooled society would be a society in which everyone shall have the widest and freest possible choice to learn whatever he wants to learn, whether in school or in some altogether different way.&quot;

<doc id="1107735" wikidata="Q283787" url="?curid=1107735" title="Mimi Coertse">
<text>Maria Sophia (Mimi) Coertse, DMS (born 12 June 1932) is a South African soprano.

On 26 January 2020, Mimi was also inaugurated as a living legend in the South African Legends Museum. She was one of only 20 South African legends of whom a bust was also made.

==Early life==

Coertse, born in Durban, matriculated at the Helpmekaar Girls High School in Johannesburg. She began vocal studies in South Africa in 1949. Her first vocal coach in Johannesburg was Aimee Parkerson.

Her debut performance in South Africa was singing Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; at the Johannesburg City Hall on 11 December 1951. In July 1953 she married broadcaster and composer Dawid Engela. She left South Africa in September 1953 for London, and then went via The Hague to Vienna. In January 1954 she started training with Maria Hittorff and Josef Witt.

==Opera career==
Coertse made her debut in January 1955 as the &quot;first flower girl&quot; in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, Karl Böhm conducting. She also sang in Basel at the Teatro San Carlo. On 17 March 1956 she made her debut at the Vienna State Opera as the Queen of the Night in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; by Mozart and remained with the Vienna State Opera until 1978. Her Covent Garden debut was in 1956, in the same role.

Her roles were limited in the United Kingdom as the Equity boycott of South Africa due to Apartheid, prevented its members from having anything to do with South Africa&#x27;s entertainment industry.

Coertse sang the soprano part in Bach&#x27;s &quot;Matthäus-Passion&quot; at Fritz Wunderlich&#x27;s first appearance in Vienna in 1958, when he performed the tenor arias with Julius Patzak singing the Evangelist. In 1958, Coertse and Fritz Wunderlich again worked together at the Aix-en-Provence festival in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;.

In 1965, she sang Konstanze in &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; at the Vienna State Opera which also featured Fritz Wunderlich as Belmonte. In 1966, Mimi was honoured by the President of Austria with the title &quot;Österreichischer Kammersänger&quot;, for her ten years of work as a permanent member at the Vienna State Opera.

Her repertoire also includes:

* &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) – Queen of the night
* &quot;Il Seraglio&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) – Constance
* &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (Richard Strauss) – Najade, later Zerbinetta

==Later years==

Since returning to South Africa in 1973, she has been a regular guest on South African stages and also a frequent broadcaster on radio and television. She returned to the Vienna State Opera for a single farewell performance as Elisabetta in Don Carlo on 14 December 1978.

In recent years, she has devoted her time to exposing young South African singers to the neglected art of Lieder singing which can be artistically even more demanding than opera singing. Her support for her fellow South African musicians has been outstanding – as may be witnessed in her &quot;Debut with Mimi&quot; and through the &quot;Mimi Coertse Bursary&quot;.

In 1996, Austria&#x27;s Federal Ministry for Science and Art awarded her the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art (Austrian Honour, first class) honour, the highest honour an artist can receive in that country.

In 1998, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Pretoria and another in 2013 from the Unisa. In 2002 she would receive the Golden Rathausmann from the mayor of Vienna.

In 1998, Coertse and Neels Hansen founded &quot;The Black Tie Ensemble&quot;, a development project which enables young, classically trained singers to bridge the gap between training and professional performance.

This project has developed into the most exciting classical singing ensemble in South Africa, and is now on the brink of becoming a vibrant, new, young opera company. A project for future stars of Africa! The Ensemble, sponsored by Sappi, performs operas at the State Theatre (Pretoria), Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden (Johannesburg) and the Civic Theatre (Johannesburg).

On 26 January 2020, Mimi was also inaugurated as a living legend in the South African Legends Museum. She was one of only 20 South African legends of whom a bust was made.

== Personal life ==

Coertse was married three times. Coertse&#x27;s first marriage was to South African composer Dawid Engela in 1953 but the marriage ended in divorce in 1957. Her second marriage was to Italian businessman Diego Brighi in 1965 but this marriage ended in divorce in 1969. Her last marriage was to a South African businessman, Werner Ackerman, in 1970 and lasted until 1994. After five miscarriages, she adopted a son and daughter, Werner and Mia.

<text>Allendale, often marked on maps as &quot;Allendale Town&quot;, is a village and civil parish in south west Northumberland, England. It is located within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

At the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 2,120, decreasing to 2,021 at the 2011 Census. Allendale is within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB); the second largest of the 40 AONB&#x27;s in England and Wales. The local economy is predominantly based on agriculture (notably sheep farming) and tourism, although of late it has become a popular commuter town for Newcastle upon Tyne.

Allendale is located around by road from the town of Hexham, and around from both Carlisle and Newcastle upon Tyne.

== History ==

Allendale refers to the &quot;dale&quot; or valley of the River Allen. Evidence of prehistoric settlement has been found on the surrounding moorland. In the 16th century this area, close to the Scottish border, was a lawless and troubled place. Fortified farmhouses known as &#x27;bastles&#x27; were constructed to protect residents and livestock against reiver raids. Allendale has a concentration of bastles, around 40 can still be seen, many as scenic ruins.

Local mining for lead has occurred since Roman times, with the first smelting mill being constructed in the 1600s. The significant growth of Allendale Town and the surrounding villages was fuelled by that of the local lead-mining and smelting industries in the 19th century. The remains of two flues from the former smelting mill (between Allendale and Catton) run to chimneys up on the fells high above the village. The smelting mill is now home to the Allendale Brewery and the Allenmills Regeneration Project. In 1874 Allendale Co-operative Society was established.

In 1869, the Hexham and Allendale Railway was opened to provide improved transport, but its opening coincided with a rapid decline in the industry due to cheap imports of lead. The last mines in the area closed in 1894 (although an attempt was made to re-open the mine at Allenheads in the 1970s).

With the closure of the lead mines, the population rapidly declined and Allendale became a popular tourist destination for Edwardian Tynesiders seeking a country escape. The railway was finally closed to passengers in 1930 and to goods in 1950, when the local terminus was bought by the stationmaster and opened as a caravan park.

Popularly held to be the town or dale that is referenced in Charles Jefferys&#x27; and Sidney Nelson&#x27;s 1835 ballad The Rose of Allandale Rose of Allendale, published in the New York Mirror, and later sung by Paddy Reilly, The Dubliners and many others, it seems more likely that this song is either metaphorical or refers literally to the community on Allan Water in the Scottish Highlands at the beginning of the Firth of Forth. The explicit reference to Allendale, moreover, in &#x27;Lucy Gray of Allendale&#x27;, a musical setting of the earliest known work by Cumbrian poet Robert Anderson, manages to get the spelling of the town correctly.

===New Year fire festival===
The town&#x27;s New Year celebrations involve lighted tar barrels that are carried on the heads of revellers called guisers. This tradition dates back so far that it is untraceable, with definitive evidence only back to the mid-1800s. It appears to have originated from the lighting of a silver band that was carolling at New Year. They were unable to use candles to light their music because of strong winds, so someone suggested that a tar barrel be used. As the band had to move from place to place, it was easier to carry the barrels upon the guisers&#x27; heads, rather than rolling them. The festival&#x27;s origins are unclear, with claims for both pagan and Christian roots.
== Governance ==
Allendale is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham, Joe Morris of the Labour Party is the Member of Parliament. 

Until Brexit the residents of Allendale voted to elect MEPs for the North East England constituency of the European Parliament.

For local government purposes Allemdale is in the Tynedale Division for elections to Northumberland County Council, a unitary authority. Before the 2009 structural changes to local government in England were implemented it was governed by the former Tynedale Council. Allendale also has its own parish council.

== Economy ==
The village hosts a health centre, village shop, Post Office, a store operated by Allendale Co-operative Society, brewery, butchers, chemist, gift shop, tea-room, art-cafe, beauty and holistic healing centre, and several pubs.

Owing to its location, Allendale is a popular country holiday destination. There are a number of holiday cottages in and around the village as well as a caravan park.

The Museum of Classic Sci-Fi is housed in a cellar in the village.

== Public services ==
Allendale hosts a scout group and there is an active village hall that hosts regular events. Allendale Library is located at Dawson Place in the village square.

There is also a fire station in the town.

The local community is served both by the Anglican Church of St. Cuthbert&#x27;s and a Methodist chapel.

<text>Noel Jan Tyl (December 31, 1936 – December 31, 2019) was an American humanistic astrologer and writer of many books on the subject. In the 1960s and 70s he was a bass-baritone opera singer who was particularly noted for his Wagnerian roles.

==Life and career==
Tyl was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Harvard University in social relations (psychology, sociology, and anthropology) in 1958. He had studied singing and piano at school and as a freshman at Harvard joined the Harvard Glee Club. Two years later, he was elected its manager. While at Harvard he also sang in the Harvard Opera Guild&#x27;s first production, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. After graduation he moved to Texas where he worked as the business manager of Houston Grand Opera and continued his voice studies. He then moved to New York City for further voice studies while simultaneously working as a public relations executive. In 1964 Tyl won the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and shortly thereafter commenced a full-time opera career.

Over the next twenty years he appeared in many American opera houses, including, New York City Opera, Cincinnati Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Seattle Opera, and Washington Opera as well as appearing regularly with the Vienna State Opera and the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf. He initially sang bass roles but in 1970 expanded into the bass-baritone repertoire and found a particular affinity with Wagnerian roles such as Hans Sachs (&quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;), Wotan (&quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;), and The Dutchman (&quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;). Tyl had retired from the opera stage by the late 1970s and returned to public relations after founding the Washington, D.C.-based firm Tyl Associates. However, he came out of retirement in 1981 to appear in two productions (&quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Semele&quot;) with Washington Opera and in 1987 sang in a live German radio broadcast of Kurt Weill&#x27;s cantata, &quot;Ballad of the Magna Carta&quot;. Earlier in 1987, he had given a benefit solo recital for the McLean Choral Society. Amongst the pieces on the programme were two of his own compositions, a setting of Longfellow&#x27;s poem &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; and &quot;A Rudhyar Suite: Sunset, Truth, Rebirth, Awareness&quot; which was set to texts by the astrologer, composer, and poet Dane Rudhyar.

By the late 1960s, Tyl had developed an interest in astrology and its relationship to human psychology, particularly need theory. Astrology became his parallel profession for many years, and since his retirement from Tyl Assdociates has been his sole profession. His first book, &quot;The Horoscope as Identity&quot;, was published in 1973 by Llewellyn Publications and began his long association with that publisher. A twelve volume series &quot;The Principles and Practice of Astrology&quot; soon followed and over the years he became the company&#x27;s most published author. His &quot;Synthesis and Counseling In Astrology&quot;, a 1000-page professional manual on the use of astrology in counseling, was published in 1994. That same year, he moved to Fountain Hills, Arizona, where he continued to work as a consulting astrologer as well as teaching, lecturing and writing on the subject. At the 1998 United Astrology Congress, the world convention for astrology, he received the Regulus Award for &quot;establishing and maintaining a professional image in the field.&quot; His 2001 &quot;Solar Arcs: Astrology&#x27;s Most Successful Predictive System&quot; contains autobiographical material in relation to his own horoscope.

<doc id="1107748" wikidata="Q1345291" url="?curid=1107748" title="South Stradbroke Island">
<text>South Stradbroke Island (Indigenous: Minjerribah), colloquially &quot;South Straddie&quot;, is an island that lies within Moreton Bay in the Australian state of Queensland, south of Brisbane and forms the northern end of Gold Coast. The island is a locality within the City of Gold Coast. In , South Stradbroke Island had a population of 142 people.

The by sized island is the smaller one of the two Stradbroke Islands and lies very close to the mainland. The island has hundreds of wild wallabies that are usually human orientated. They are also well known for stealing bread from tents and cabins, and joining campers at their fires.

One of more than 360 islands within Moreton Bay, the southern end of South Stradbroke Island fronts the Broadwater, and the tip marks the Gold Coast Seaway, only a matter of metres from the mainland at Southport Spit. In the northeast is Tipplers Passage which separates the island from many smaller islands within the bay closer to the mainland. The east coast borders the Coral Sea.

South Stradbroke Island consists mainly of sand dunes, remnant livistona rainforest and melaleuca wetlands. The island also has unique flora and fauna. The golden wallaby is endemic to the island and the agile wallaby, once more common to the region, has now retreated to the island.

== History ==

Even before its formation as a separate island in 1896 the lands and waters of what is now South Stradbroke were sacred to the Quandamooka people who had long inhabited Redland Bay islands. 

To the north the island is separated by the Jumpinpin Channel from the larger North Stradbroke Island. Both islands were originally one island, Stradbroke Island. In September 1894, heavy seas drove aground the barque &quot;Cambus Wallace&quot; at a narrow isthmus roughly halfway down the island&#x27;s length. Salvage activity (including the detonation of a cargo of explosives) weakened the sand dunes along the spit such that by the spring of 1896, storms and tides had created a permanent opening from Moreton Bay to the Coral Sea now known as Jumpinpin Channel. The new tidal channel caused large changes to the channels and islands within southern Moreton Bay. Coastal managers are concerned that eventually one day Jumpinpin may repair itself which may cause problems for tidal waterway management including fish stocks, dugong habitat, erosion and flooding.

Some land clearing for cattle grazing conducted in the early 20th century has occurred. During the 1950 to 1960s sand mining was conducted at the northern ocean beach area but reserves were limited. From the 1870s onwards the island&#x27;s inner shores were used as camp grounds for holders of oystering licences. A small township called Moondarewa with 156 surveyed lots, was established at the island&#x27;s southern tip. By 1953 the island&#x27;s natural movement north had washed away most of the settlement. Also once located at the southern end was a small area of vine scrub rainforest that attracted significant bird-life.

In 2009, some filming was done on the island for the 2011 film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;.

On 17 April 2023 services to the community of Couran Cove were turned off amid a legal dispute. Hundreds of homes were without power, water, and gas.

== Demographics ==
The number of people on the island swells significantly during the holiday season.

In , South Stradbroke Island had a population of 101 people.

In , South Stradbroke Island had a population of 41 people.

In , South Stradbroke Island had a population of 142 people.

== Heritage listings ==
South Stradbroke Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* Lot 50WD3686: Grave of Ben Frances Manager
* Dux Anchorage (): Dux Hut.
* Canaipa Passage, Jumpinpin: Site of the wreck of the Cambus Wallace
* 4 Island Street, Currigee: The Graves

==Accommodation facilities==
The island is a tourist destination. There are numerous campsites including an anchorage for the Southport Yacht Club and Dux Campsite, owned by The Southport School. Tipplers was purchased by the Gold Coast City Council in 2009. Due to ongoing encroachment of the sand dunes, the Council-run Bedrooms Campsite was closed in 2013. The Council has three alternate campgrounds: Tipplers that accommodates up to 100 tents with gas BBQs, a children&#x27;s play area, and a kiosk that has basic camping supplies including ice and firewood; and North and South Currigee that together accommodates up to 80 tents with access to BBQs, a children&#x27;s play area, and a mini kiosk for basic camping supplies.

Couran Cove Island Resort is located on the north side of South Stradbroke Island Resort. Located approximately forty minutes by boat from Surfers Paradise, Couran Cove Island Resort provides a range of accommodation options, dining and the opportunity to see native Australian animals in the forest. The resort was established by Ron Clarke and originally opened in 1998 as an eco-tourist resort. While the resort is not marketed as such now it does incorporate a number of environmental design features and technologies. There are also several private house located at the southern end of the Island. 

As at May 2023, there are many reports from remaining South Stradbroke Island residents that the resort closed after Easter 2023, with no defined reopening date, while the associated entities seek to resolve long-running legal disputes. Many local media reports indicate that the numbers of remaining permanent inhabitants on the island have dwindled, and as a result of disputes some of the island residents have had access to water, electricity and gas cut off.

==Recreation==
An conservation park provides access to native wildlife. The park is suitable for hiking and ocean fishing.

Other recreational activities include jet ski tours, tube rides, 4WD tours, and speed boat rides. These operate from the Couran Cove Island Resort and Tipplers Passage.

== Education ==
There are no schools on the island, but there are many schools on the mainland. However, accessing those schools would depend on the transport options available from the home location on the island. Distance education would be another option.

<doc id="1107755" wikidata="Q7714401" url="?curid=1107755" title="The Art Institutes">
<text>The Art Institutes (AI) were a private for-profit system of art schools in the United States.

The Art Institutes offered programs at the certificate, associate&#x27;s, bachelors, and master&#x27;s levels. By 2012, there were 50 campuses with roughly 80,000 enrolled students. Long owned by Education Management Corporation (EDMC), the Art Institutes were sold in 2017 to the Dream Center Foundation, a Los Angeles–based Pentecostal organization. From 2019 to 2023, the Art Institutes were owned by the Education Principle Foundation (formerly known as Colbeck Foundation), a non-profit that also owned South University. In 2022, South University separated from the Education Principle Foundation and, by extension, the Art Institutes.

The Art Institutes faced accreditation and legal issues and student loan debtors have appealed to the US Department of Education for debt cancellation through defense to repayment claims. These efforts are premised on allegations they were defrauded. The student debt group &quot;I Am Ai&quot; has acted as a support group for students and former students of the Art Institutes, offering advice about debt cancellation.

All remaining Art Institute schools closed on September 30, 2023. The announcement was made less than a week prior to the closure, providing little warning to the Art Institutes&#x27; 1,700 students.

==History==
===Origins and growth (1969–2010)===
The Art Institutes system was created in 1969 when Education Management Corporation (EDMC) acquired The Art Institute of Pittsburgh, which was founded in 1921. Starting in 2000, The Art Institutes launched its distance education program, Art Institute Online, to allow students to work towards bachelors degrees in graphic design and certificates in digital web design online. At that time, on-site bachelors degrees were offered at 17 or 21 Institutes of which 30% of the students were enrolled. The Art Institutes expanded through the acquisition of existing art colleges and the establishment of new Art Institutes. In 2001, there were around 20 campuses of The Art Institutes; this grew to approximately 30 locations in 2006 when the school&#x27;s parent company was acquired by Goldman Sachs, Providence Equity Partners, and Leeds Equity Partners. In 2009, EDMC became a publicly traded corporation, reaching 50 Art Institutes by 2012.

===Scandal, decline, and closure (2011–2023)===

In 2011, &quot;Frontline&quot; released a documentary titled &quot;Educating Sergeant Pantzke&quot;. In the documentary, Iraq war veteran Chris Pantzke discussed the lack of disability services at the school. According to Pantzke, &quot;Being a soldier, you don&#x27;t want to quit, you don&#x27;t want to give up or fail.&quot; After doing his own research, Pantzke concluded that the degree he was pursuing wasn&#x27;t &quot;worth much more than the paper is worth,&quot; and felt he was &quot;throwing away taxpayer money&quot; by using GI Bill funds.

In 2012, The Art Institute schools began to experience a decrease in the number of new students enrolling, seeing enrollment numbers drop by approximately 20 percent between the second quarter of the 2012 fiscal year and the start of 2013. EDMC attributed the drop in enrollment to limited access to Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students and the economic recession. In February 2013, EDMC announced plans for a three-year-old tuition freeze at The Art Institutes. Under this plan, the company pledged to maintain the current cost of tuition through 2015.

In June 2013, EDMC announced that its President John Mazzoni would resign effective July 14, 2013, after 27 years at the organization. Charles Restivo, Group Vice President, became the Interim President of The Art Institutes. In 2014, the US Department of Education reported that ten EDMC campuses, including several Art Institutes, were placed under heightened cash monitoring. The Art Institute of Pittsburgh was one of the schools listed.

In 2014, an investigation by the City Attorney of San Francisco&#x27;s office led to a $4.4 million settlement. The city claimed AI used deceptive marketing tactics resulting in underestimated program costs for students and inflated job placement figures for graduates.

In May 2015, EDMC announced that it was closing 15 of the Art Institute locations, affecting over 5,400 students.&quot; Campuses slated to close included those in Atlanta, New York City, Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania. In January 2016, EDMC announced that additional Art Institutes were ceasing enrollments. These campuses are The Art Institute of California – Los Angeles, The Art Institute of St. Louis, and the Art Institute of Tucson. At least 200 additional employees were laid off in May 2016. In June 2016, EDMC announced that the Art Institutes International Minnesota were ceasing enrollments. That meant a total of 19 Art Institute campuses were scheduled to close.

In June 2016, Tim Moscato, chief operating officer at the Art Institutes, resigned amid more downsizing. The same month, the US Department of Education voted to end Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) power to accredit. ACICS was stripped of its power to accredit in September. As of June 1, 2016, twelve Art Institute campuses were under &quot;heightened cash monitoring&quot; (or HCM1) by the US Department of Education because colleges are required to hold a certain amount of money to meet obligations in case the school closes prematurely. Campuses affected were Pittsburgh, Portland, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Minnesota, Colorado, Houston, Seattle, New York City, York, and Phoenix. In December 2016, nine additional Art Institutes (The Art Institute of Atlanta, The Art Institute of Houston, Miami International University of Art and Design) and their branch campuses in Charleston, Nashville, Arlington, Virginia Beach, Austin and San Antonio were placed on probation by their accreditor, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

In January 2018, Art Institutes locations in Novi and Denver and the Illinois Institute of Art locations in Chicago and Schaumburg lost their accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission. They did not inform students about the loss of accreditation until June despite being required to disclose this at the time of the loss. In 2018, Dream Center Education Holdings reported that more AI campuses were closing. In December 2018, 23 Art Institutes were closed.

In January 2019, The Washington Student Achievement Council suspended AI-Seattle&#x27;s license to operate, which blocks enrollment of new students. The council will reinstate the license when Dream Center Education Holdings shows that it has &quot;regained financial solvency or completed a viable reorganization.&quot; AI Las Vegas also received a show cause notice from ACICS requesting that the school provide information showing why it should not lose its accreditation.

In 2019, reports from DCEH&#x27;s monitor, Marc Dottore, indicated that $9–13 million of federal funds, meant for students stipends, was missing. According to the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, the monitor is &quot;nearly out of cash to manage the entities he&#x27;s tasked to oversee.&quot; Dottore has written to the Department of Education that Studio Enterprise, a company designated to service former and current DCEH schools, is taking service fees from the deal without providing any services, draining badly-needed cash from the operation. Information about the Education Principle Foundation is limited, but it appears to be formerly known as the Colbeck Foundation. According to the Republic Report, the Colbeck Foundation has ties to Studio Enterprise.

In February 2019, a federal court-appointed receiver halted Dream Center Education Holdings&#x27; plans to close the Art Institute of Pittsburgh on March 31, 2019.

In March 2019, teachers and other staff had not been paid their final pay checks. As many as 13 Art Institute campuses remained open in 2019, with the remaining schools facing financial struggles.

In 2022, the Art Institute was one of 153 institutions included in student loan cancellation due to alleged fraud. The class action was brought by a group of more than 200,000 student borrowers, assisted by the Project on Predatory Student Lending, part of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. A settlement was approved in August 2022, stating that the schools on the list were included &quot;substantial misconduct by the listed schools, whether credibly alleged or in some instances proven.&quot; In April 2023, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the settlement and allowed to proceed the debt cancellation due to alleged fraud.

In September 2023, the institution&#x27;s website was updated to say that all Art Institute schools will close on September 30, 2023.

On May 1, 2024, President Joe Biden canceled $6.1 billion in federal student debt owed by 317,000 former Art Institutes students. The U.S. Department of Education will notify eligible borrowers and refund previous payments on the affected student loans.

==Schools and programs==

The Art Institutes offered degree programs at the associate&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s levels, as well as non-degree diploma programs. Areas of study included graphic design, media arts and animation, culinary arts, photography, digital filmmaking and video production, interior design, audio production, fashion design, game art and design, baking and pastry, and fashion marketing.

==Ownership changes ==
The Art Institutes&#x27; former parent company, Education Management Corporation (EDMC), was headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

EDMC&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO) was in 2009. Todd S. Nelson, who was previously the CEO of Apollo Education Group, became an EDMC board member in 2007 and the chairman of the board of directors in 2012.

In November 2014, EDMC was delisted from the NASDAQ amid financial difficulties, lawsuits, and investigations and its stock was valued at less than one cent per share.

In 2017, Education Management Corporation reported that it had sold the existing Art Institutes to The Dream Center Foundation, a Los Angeles–based Pentecostal organization. The sale was complete in October 2017. In July 2017, an accrediting agency, Middle States Association, rejected the sale of the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Art Institutes to the Dream Center Foundation.

In January 2019, DCEH chairman Randall Barton stated that the Art Institutes, excluding the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, Art Institute of Las Vegas and Argosy University campuses, have been transferred to the Education Principle Foundation. Also in January 2019, Dream Center Education Holdings announced that AI schools, excluding AI Pittsburgh, AI Las Vegas, and Argosy campuses, had been transferred to the Education Principle Foundation with help from the US Department of Education. Inside Higher Ed described Education Principle Foundation as &quot;a Delaware nonprofit with no annual budget and almost no internet presence&quot;, and linked it to private equity firm Colbeck Capital Management. Studio Enterprise, a Los Angeles company tied to Colbeck Capital Management, was also involved in the ownership transfer.

Art Institute students from closed schools were directed to DCEH&#x27;s partner institutions and other for-profit colleges: DeVry University, Walden University, and Trident University.

According to the Republic Report, the court appointed receiver, Studio Enterprise &amp; South University had until April 11, 2019, to negotiate to separate both South University schools and the remaining Art Institute schools from the Dream Center Education IT Platform by September 11, 2019. &quot;Should they fail to agree, the plan of reorganization will likely fail, thereby dooming South University and the Art Institutes&quot;.

==Litigation==
Between 2000 and 2018, the Art Institutes parent company EDMC was subject to numerous lawsuits from former students, former faculty, and government agencies. Thousands of former students of the Art Institutes claim they have been deceived and misled by the schools and their recruiters and have filed claims with the US Department of Education. Art Institute students are able to file defense to repayment claims with the US Department of Education.

In October 2000, EDMC announced the settlement of a lawsuit brought by a group of approximately 350 former students of The Art Institute of Houston.

From 2011 to 2015, EDMC was involved in a United States Department of Justice investigation and lawsuit alleging both illegal recruitment practices by EDMC schools, including The Art Institutes, and fraudulent receipt of $11 billion in federal and state financial aid money. A 2011 US DOJ report claimed EDMC &quot;created a &#x27;boiler room&#x27; style sales culture and has made recruiting and enrolling new students the sole focus of its compensation system.&quot;

In May 2013, a federal judge in Pennsylvania rejected a bid to dismiss a lawsuit against EDMC by a former EDMC employee. The lawsuit alleges that the corporation and its affiliates engaged in a scheme to maximize profits from financial aid programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education. The complainant in the case, Jason Sobek, who worked as an admissions director for EDMC in Pittsburgh from June 2008 through November 2010, alleges that the firm falsified information given to the Department of Education that indicated they were in compliance with the loan programs&#x27; eligibility requirements. In testimony that provided the basis for the lower court&#x27;s decision last October, Sobek alleged that EDMC operated a &quot;carefully crafted and widespread for-profit education scheme [in which] defendants have defrauded the United States and its taxpayers out of millions of dollars in the form of federally backed student loans and grants.&quot;

In November 2015, EDMC agreed to pay $95.5 million to settle claims of illegal recruiting, and consumer fraud.

In April 2016, two former AI teachers filed suit in Alameda City Superior Court claiming EDMC did not pay them a minimum wage or provide adequate rest periods, in order &quot;to reduce compensation and increase its own profits.&quot; On September 8, 2016, Art Institutes students known as &quot;I Am Ai&quot; presented a notice to the Director of New England Institute of Art (NEIA) about a lawsuit that would be coming in 30 days. The lawsuit is being written by the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. On September 24, 2016, the Attorney General of Massachusetts expressed concern that the teaching duties at NEIA were being taken over by an unlicensed Indian company with no background in teaching US art students. The AG&#x27;s Office stated that if a proper education for NEIA students could not be ensured, that NEIA should shut down at the end of the 2016. In December 2016, nine additional Art Institutes were placed on probation by their accreditor, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

On July 6, 2017, two former Art Institute students filed a lawsuit against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos for illegally delaying rules intended to protect borrowers&#x27; rights. They were represented by the Project on Predatory Student Lending and Public Citizen in two lawsuits. This lawsuit helped clear the way for 2016 Borrower Defense Rule to take effect.

In 2018, Dream Center Education Holdings took control of the remaining 31 Art Institutes schools. In December 2018, Art Institute students filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that Dream Center Educational Holdings failed to notify students it had lost institutional accreditation at four Illinois AI campuses.

==Student outcomes==
According to the College Scorecard, the Art Institute of Atlanta had a 20 percent graduation rate, a median student loan debt ranging from $16,500 (Culinary Arts) to $42,549 (AV Communication Technologies), and a median salary after attending of $19,000 (BFA) to $35,000 (BS in Computer Software). Two years after entering repayment, 9 percent were making progress in their student loans.

<doc id="1107758" wikidata="Q4969110" url="?curid=1107758" title="Bristol city centre">
<text>Bristol city centre is the commercial, cultural and business centre of Bristol, England. It is the area north of the New Cut of the River Avon, bounded by Clifton Wood and Clifton to the north-west, Kingsdown and Cotham to the north, and St Pauls, Lawrence Hill and St Phillip&#x27;s Marsh to the east. The Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, BBC Broadcasting House, the main campus of the University of Bristol, Bristol Crown Court and Magistrate&#x27;s Courts, Temple Meads railway station, Bristol bus station, the Park Street, Broadmead and Cabot Circus shopping areas together with numerous music venues, theatres and restaurants are located in this area. The area consists of the council wards of Central, Hotwells &amp; Harbourside, and part of Lawrence Hill.

== Historic centre ==
The mediaeval heart of the city was immediately north of Bristol Bridge, between the River Frome and the River Avon, at the Bristol High Cross where the four cross streets High Street, Wine Street, Broad Street and Corn Street meet. The traditional view that this was also the Saxon centre was challenged in the 1970s by archaeology suggesting that Bristol&#x27;s origins lay to the east of High Street in the area that is now Castle Park, but more recent Saxon finds around Small Street favour the earlier view.

This was Bristol&#x27;s pre-war central shopping district, a knot of ancient narrow streets including Wine Street, Mary le Port Street and Castle Street, which was severely damaged in 1940 during the Bristol Blitz. The area to the north and west of Castle Park, around Broad Street, Corn Street and St Nicholas Market largely survived, and contains many historic buildings.

== The Centre ==

The course of the River Frome, immediately to the west of the historic centre, was covered over in stages, in the second half of the 19th century. The area became the hub of the Bristol Tramways network, and was known as the Tramways Centre. It was so called long after the last trams left in 1941, but is now known simply as The Centre.

Between 1936 and 1938, the Centre was enlarged when more of the River Frome, between Broad Quay and St Augustine&#x27;s Parade, was covered in, making way for the Inner Circuit Road. The western side of the Inner Circuit Road has since been largely decommissioned, and recent works have rebalanced The Centre in favour of pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users.

==Broadmead==

The area northeast of the historic area, around Broadmead, was redeveloped after the war despite overwhelming public opinion against it, and the streets and shops in Broadmead became the main shopping district of the city. Like many 1950s buildings in Britain, affordable but architecturally uninteresting utilitarian buildings form the bulk of the Broadmead area.

In the 1980s, some of these were demolished to make way for the Galleries shopping centre, which is a three level covered street. In 2008, the shopping area was extended over the central ring road to produce a new shopping centre, Cabot Circus, which opened in September 2008.

==Harbourside==

The City Docks were immediately south of the Centre. Although most ships used Avonmouth Docks after the Royal Edward Dock was opened in 1908, ocean-going ships were regularly seen at the Centre until the 1960s. In 1972 the Royal Portbury Dock was opened, and the City Docks were closed. The harbour buildings, including the tobacco warehouses, became redundant.

The harbourside has been regenerated in the 1990s and 2000s, with the refurbishment of warehouses as bars, restaurants, the Watershed Media Centre and the Arnolfini art gallery, as well as the creation of the At-Bristol science centre (later rebranded as We the Curious).

<doc id="1107759" wikidata="Q549942" url="?curid=1107759" title="Ronald D. Moore">
<text>Ronald Dowl Moore (born July 5, 1964) is an American screenwriter and television producer. He is best known for his work on &quot;Star Trek,&quot; as well as on the re-imagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; television series, for which he won a Peabody Award, and on &quot;Outlander&quot;, based on the novels of the same name by Diana Gabaldon. In 2019, he created and wrote the series &quot;For All Mankind&quot; for Apple TV+.

==Early life==
Moore was raised in Chowchilla, California. He describes himself as a &#x27;recovering Catholic&#x27; and is agnostic. Moore dabbled in writing and drama in high school. He went on to study government (political science) at Cornell University, where he was Literary Secretary of The Kappa Alpha Society, originally on a Navy ROTC scholarship, but left during his senior year in the spring of 1986 after losing interest in his studies. He later completed his degree through Regents College. He served for one month during the summer of his freshman year on the frigate USS &quot;W.S. Sims&quot;.

Moore spent the next three years drifting between various odd jobs and temporary work. As Moore himself recounted in the book, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation 365&quot;, by the fall of 1986, he was &quot;less than a year into my career as a college dropout... working as a medical records technician (otherwise known as a receptionist) at an animal hospital, all the while telling myself that I was actually a professional writer simply awaiting my inevitable discovery.&quot;

==Career==

=== &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1988–94) ===

In 1988, he toured the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; sets during the filming of the episode &quot;Time Squared.&quot; While there, he passed a script he had written to one of Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s assistants, who helped him get an agent who submitted the script through proper channels. About seven months later, executive producer Michael Piller read the script and bought it; it became the third-season episode &quot;The Bonding.&quot; Based on that script, he was offered the opportunity to write a second script titled &quot;The Defector&quot; and that led to a staff position as a script editor. Two years later, he was promoted to co-producer, then producer for the series&#x27; final year (1994).

Moore wrote a number of episodes that developed the Klingon race and culture, starting with &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; which introduced the Klingon home world, the Klingon High Council, and the Klingon Chancellor, continuing with &quot;Reunion,&quot; &quot;Redemption, Part 1 and 2,&quot; &quot;Ethics,&quot; and &quot;Rightful Heir.&quot; He is credited with writing or co-writing 27 &quot;Next Generation&quot; episodes.

He co-wrote several episodes with Brannon Braga, developing a successful working relationship that led to them being offered the chance to write the series television finale, &quot;All Good Things...&quot; (which won the 1995 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation). The series also received an Emmy Award nomination in its final year for Outstanding Drama Series, losing to &quot;Picket Fences&quot;. The pair also wrote the screenplays for the &quot;Next Generation&quot; crew&#x27;s first two big screen appearances, &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994) and &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996).

===&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1994–99)===

Moore then joined the production staff of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; for its third season as a supervising producer, being promoted to a co-executive producer position for the series&#x27; final two years. During this time he also worked again with Braga on the script for the second &quot;Next Generation&quot; motion picture &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; and on a draft of the &quot;&quot; script that was re-written by Robert Towne for which they received a &quot;story by&quot; credit.

During his time on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, he continued to write episodes that expanded on Klingon culture such as &quot;The House of Quark&quot;, &quot;Sons of Mogh&quot;, &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, &quot;Looking for par&#x27;Mach in All the Wrong Places&quot;, &quot;Soldiers of the Empire&quot;, &quot;You Are Cordially Invited...&quot; and &quot;Once More Unto the Breach&quot;. He also wrote episodes that dealt with controversial subjects such as genetic engineering (&quot;Doctor Bashir, I Presume?&quot;), co-wrote the episode that featured Star Trek&#x27;s first same-sex kiss (&quot;Rejoined&quot;) and killed off another popular character, Vedek Bareil Antos (&quot;Life Support&quot;).

During his time on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, he also made an effort to engage with fans, frequently posting on AOL forums where he would answer fan questions or address their concerns about the show, a practice he continued with &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; through his weblog and in his podcasts.

===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (1999)===

With the end of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; in 1999, Moore transferred over to the production staff of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; at the start of its sixth season, where his writing partner Braga was executive producer. However, Moore left &quot;Voyager&quot; only a matter of weeks later, with &quot;Survival Instinct&quot; and &quot;Barge of the Dead&quot; as his only credits. In a January 2000 interview for &quot;Cinescape&quot; magazine, Moore cited problems in his working relationship with Braga for his short stay:

Moore and Braga can be heard talking together on the commentary tracks for the DVD release of &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;.

=== Post-&quot;Star Trek&quot; career (2000–03) ===

After leaving &quot;Voyager&quot;, Moore briefly worked as a consulting producer on &quot;Good vs Evil&quot; before joining &quot;Roswell&quot; as a co-executive producer and staff writer at the start of its second season in 2000. Moore and series creator Jason Katims jointly ran &quot;Roswell&quot; until the show ended in 2002. Moore wrote some of the show&#x27;s most popular episodes, including &quot;Ask Not&quot; and the series finale &quot;Graduation,&quot; which he co-wrote with Katims. He also wrote the episode &quot;Cry Your Name.&quot;

During this time, Moore also developed a pilot based on Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; for The WB, but production on the project was halted due to &#x27;creative differences&#x27; between Moore and the network. The network tried changing the story (without Moore&#x27;s approval) until it no longer resembled the original book series. Moore was an original fan of the books and refused to continue working on the pilot with the changes being made.

In 2002, David Eick (whom Moore worked with on &quot;Good vs Evil&quot;) approached Moore about a new four-hour &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; mini-series for Universal. Moore developed the mini-series with Eick, writing the scripts and updating the old series, also developing a back-story that could work for a regular weekly series should the mini-series be successful. At the same time, Moore was approached by HBO about running a new television series called &quot;Carnivàle&quot;; however, they decided to offer the position to Henry Bromell instead and offered Moore a consultant position on the writing staff. He accepted, but Bromell left soon after production started and Moore became showrunner. While Moore worked on the first year of &quot;Carnivàle&quot;, Eick ran the day-to-day production of the &quot;Galactica&quot; mini-series in Canada. &quot;Galactica&quot; aired in 2003 and became the highest-rated miniseries on cable that year and the best ratings that year for any sci-fi show. After &quot;Carnivàle&quot; reached the end of its first season and the Sci-Fi Channel ordered a thirteen-episode weekly series of &quot;Galactica&quot;, Moore left &quot;Carnivàle&quot; to assume a full-time executive producer role on &quot;Galactica&quot;.

=== &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2004–09) ===
The weekly &quot;Galactica&quot; television series debuted in October 2004 in the United Kingdom and January 2005 in the United States and Canada. Moore wrote the first two episodes of the new series, with the first episode &quot;33&quot; winning the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, the second that Moore has received during his career. In 2007, Moore was nominated once again for an Emmy Award for writing the episodes &quot;Occupation&quot; and &quot;Precipice,&quot; which aired together as the third season opener.

In April 2006, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; was among the winners of the 65th Annual Peabody Awards; Moore was among the writers and producers cited for &quot;plotlines that are deeply personal and relatable, while never compromising their affinity and passion for science fiction.&quot;

Moore was quite vocal about the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, as his &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series was one of the major flashpoints leading to the strike. Starting in August 2006, the Writers Guild ordered production to cease on the &quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance&quot; series of webisodes which had been produced as a link between the show&#x27;s second and third seasons. Tension over this would last throughout the third season. &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; was, along with other popular series such as &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;, one of the shows at the forefront of the debate over &quot;new media&quot; revenues, as the series was extensively downloaded from iTunes and recoups much of its production costs from high DVD sales as opposed to direct ratings. It was also among the most heavily time-shifted series on television, which the Nielsen ratings system does not count.

Moore&#x27;s directorial debut was scheduled to be the first episode of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; following the final season&#x27;s mid-season cliffhanger, which he would also have written. Though the writers&#x27; strike did halt production on the fourth season of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, work did resume and the show concluded on March 20, 2009. When the Writers Guild began their strike, Moore felt it was inappropriate to continue to communicate to fans using the &quot;official&quot; blog he maintained on the Scifi Channel website. As a result, he chose to start a personal website and blog, rondmoore.com, so that he could continue to freely comment on the situation without violating the terms of his membership in the Writers Guild. When the strike ended, Moore continued his commentary via his personal web site and blog.

=== &quot;Caprica&quot; (2010) ===
With the success of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, the Sci Fi Channel announced in April 2006 that Moore and Eick would be producing a spin-off called &quot;Caprica&quot; with &quot;24&quot; scriptwriter Remi Aubuchon and NBC Universal Television Studio. Moore later said in interviews that he and Eick had begun toying with the idea of a spinoff series as early as the beginning of the second season, however. The show was set 58 years before the events of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and depicts the creation of the Cylon race and the emergence of a terrorist group which apparently worships the same monotheistic god later worshipped by the Cylons.

The &quot;Caprica&quot; series premiere was released on DVD in 2009 and began airing in January 2010. Moore contributed to the pilot made-for-TV movie, then handed off control to new head writer Jane Espenson. Syfy abruptly canceled the show mid-run on October 27, 2010, before its first season had finished airing, citing low ratings. The remaining five episodes, of the twenty produced for season one, were burned off in a marathon on January 4, 2011.

===Unproduced pitches and failed pilots (2009–2013)===
In April 2009, Moore, along with several other &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; alumni, made a cameo appearance in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;A Space Oddity.&quot; The episode was directed by Michael Nankin (who directed a number of Galactica episodes), written by Bradley Thompson and David Weddle (who both started their TV writing careers on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, and worked as writer/producers on &quot;Galactica&quot;) and based on a story by Naren Shankar (who went to school with Moore and started his writing career on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;). In the episode, Moore has one line of dialogue as he portrays an irate audience member at a science fiction convention, yelling at the (fictional) producer of a dark-and-gritty remake of a beloved cult series. Several of his &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; colleagues including Grace Park and Rekha Sharma appear in non-speaking cameos, while Kate Vernon is a major guest star in the episode.

Moore also developed a pilot for Fox called &quot;Virtuality&quot;. It aired on June 26, 2009, and was not picked up. &quot;Virtuality&quot; was the first show developed under the banner of Moore&#x27;s new personal production company, &quot;Tall Ship Productions&quot;.

Moore worked on the script for the companion/prequel film of the 1982 John Carpenter film, &quot;The Thing&quot;. His screenplay was scrapped late in 2009 and rewritten by Eric Heisserer, writer of the 2010 &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;. &quot;The Thing&quot; began production in March 2010 and was released in October 2011.

In March 2010, following the mixed reception of the first half of &quot;Caprica&quot;&#x27;s first season, SyFy channel approached Moore to produce another &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; spin-off. The show was entitled &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome&quot;, and was to feature a young William Adama&#x27;s experiences in the First Cylon War. The series was originally designed as a series of webisodes, but with the cancellation of &quot;Caprica&quot;, &quot;Blood &amp; Chrome&quot; was slated to become a full television series without any direct involvement from Moore.

In May 2010, Moore signed a two-year deal with Sony Pictures TV to create and executive produce series projects for broadcast and cable through his production company, Tall Ship Productions. By late 2010 this resulted in two of Moore&#x27;s pitches being purchased by major TV networks for potential development into pilot episodes. The first was a remake of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; purchased by CBS. The second was purchased by NBC and called &quot;The McCulloch&quot;, an action-adventure series about the crew of a US Coast Guard vessel as they travel the world, to be co-produced by NBC-Universal and Sony. But neither of these projects made it to the screen.

In 2011, Moore was commissioned by Lucasfilm&#x27;s Rick McCallum to write scripts for a &quot;Star Wars&quot; live action TV series, which was being developed for ABC.

Moore developed a series for NBC in 2011 which had been described as &quot;Harry Potter for grown-ups,&quot; and it was confirmed on March 3, 2011 that the new show would be called &quot;17th Precinct&quot;. Tricia Helfer, Jamie Bamber, and James Callis had signed up for the new series which would have centered around cops at the local 17th Precinct in the fictional city of Excelsior, with Moore writing the pilot. On May 13, 2011 it was confirmed that NBC had decided not to pick up the series.

On August 30, 2011, it was announced that ABC bought Moore&#x27;s pitch for &quot;Hangtown&quot;, a Western drama series. The series was co-created by Ron D. Moore and former &quot;Caprica&quot; writer Matt Roberts. &quot;Hangtown&quot; is described as &quot;a Western with procedural elements&quot; that takes place in a frontier town in the early 1900s grappling with the development of the railroad. The potential series would revolve around the town&#x27;s old-fashioned veteran marshal who solves crimes by drawing on instinct and experience, who butt heads with the young new East Coast crime-solving doctor who relies on emerging forensics and rational inquiry. Added to the mix is a young female writer who has come to the west to write pulp stories about stereotyped &quot;Wild West&quot; crime, to send back to big city dime-novel publishers back East. Tall Ship Productions announced on Twitter on October 18, 2011, that Justin Lin had signed on to direct a potential pilot episode of &quot;Hangtown&quot;, in the event that ABC officially orders it. In an interview with &quot;Wire.com&quot; on September 29, 2012, Moore confirmed that his &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; reboot for CBS and &quot;Hangtown&quot; had been passed on.

Moore had a cameo appearance in a &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;-themed sketch of the January 2012 &quot;Portlandia&quot; episode entitled &quot;One Moore Episode,&quot; where he plays an unknown actor who has never seen &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. The episode also features a character named Ronald D. Moore who is mistaken for the TV producer.

On November 11, 2011, sci-fi news website io9.com ran an editorial about Moore, lamenting that &quot;none of his post-&quot;BSG&quot; projects has really taken off. It&#x27;s been a couple years since Moore&#x27;s writing has appeared on our screens.&quot;

In 2012, it was reported that a TV series adaptation of &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; was in development by American Broadcasting Company, written by Moore.

===&quot;Helix&quot; (2014–2015)===

On January 16, 2013, &quot;Deadline&quot; announced that Moore would return to the SyFy Channel as executive producer of a new series &quot;Helix&quot;. The project was &quot;written on spec&quot; by Cameron Porsandeh. &quot;Helix&quot; was described as being &quot;about a team of scientists investigating a possible disease outbreak at an Arctic research facility who find themselves trying to protect the world from annihilation.&quot; SyFy Channel made a 13-episode direct-to-series order (i.e., without waiting to produce a pilot episode), and it began airing on SyFy on January 10, 2014. While the marketing heavily billed Moore&#x27;s involvement in the project, he only contributed as a consultant at the opening pitch meetings, and was not the creator or showrunner – thus his actual involvement in the project was very limited. The series was cancelled after two seasons due to record low ratings.

=== &quot;Outlander&quot; (2014–) ===

In June 2012, io9.com reported that Moore had started developing a TV adaptation of Diana Gabaldon&#x27;s &quot;Outlander&quot; book series. On November 6, 2012, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that the premium subscription channel Starz had closed a deal to produce and air the series. The show began its first run on August 9, 2014 and was renewed for its second season which was based on &quot;Dragonfly in Amber&quot;, the second novel in the eight-book series. He was joined on the production by a fellow &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; contributor, producer Ira Steven Behr.

The second season, consisting of 13 episodes, premiered on April 9, 2016. The 13-episode third season, based on &quot;Voyager&quot;, aired from September to December 2017. The 13-episode fourth season, based on &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot;, aired from November 2018 to January 2019. The fifth season of 12 episodes, based on &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;, aired from February to May 2020. The sixth season was based on &quot;A Breath of Snow and Ashes&quot;. A seventh season aired in 2023, with an eighth and final season commissioned.

=== &quot;For All Mankind&quot; (2019-) and further shows ===

On December 15, 2017, it was announced that Apple had given a straight-to-series order for a space drama entitled &quot;For All Mankind&quot; created and written by Moore. 

In 2021, he signed a deal with Disney via 20th Television. In 2024 before any shows finished production he left Disney to return to Sony Pictures Television. In October, he was hired as the new writer, showrunner, and as an executive producer for Sony&#x27;s &quot;God of War&quot; adaptation for Amazon Prime Video, replacing Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, and Rafe Judkins due to a change in creative direction.

<text>Frederic Prokosch (May 17, 1906 – June 2, 1989) was an American writer, known for his novels, poetry, memoirs and criticism. He was also a distinguished translator.

==Biography==
Prokosch was born in Madison, Wisconsin, into an intellectual family that travelled widely. His father, Eduard Prokosch, an Austrian immigrant, was Professor of Germanic Languages at Yale University at the time of his death in 1938, his sister Gertrude Prokosch Kurath was a dancer and a prominent ethnomusicologist and his brother Walther Prokosch was a distinguished architect. Prokosch graduated from Haverford College in 1925 and received a Ph.D. in English in 1932 from Yale University. In his youth, he was an accomplished squash racquets player; he represented the Yale Club in the 1937 New York State squash racquets championship. He won the squash-racquets championship of France in 1938.

During World War II, Prokosch was a cultural attaché at the American Legation in Sweden. He spent most of the remainder of his life in Europe, where he led a existence. His interests were sports (tennis and squash), lepidoptery, and the printing of limited editions of poems that he admired.

From early on, Prokosch sought to surround himself with a veil of mystification and cast his life into a hopeless riddle. Approaching his sixtieth year, he boasted that no person had succeeded in knowing him as an integral personality: &quot;I have spent my life alone, utterly alone, and no biography of me could ever more than scratch the surface. All the facts in Who’s Who, or whatever, are so utterly meaningless. My real life (if I ever dared to write it!) has transpired in darkness, secrecy, fleeting contacts and incommunicable delights, any number of strange picaresque escapades and even crimes, and I don&#x27;t think that any of my &#x27;friends&#x27; have even the faintest notion of what I&#x27;m really like or have any idea of what my life has really consisted of. . . .With all the surface &#x27;respectability,&#x27; diplomatic and scholarly and illustrious social contacts, my real life has been subversive, anarchic, vicious, lonely, and capricious.&quot;

The publication of &quot;Voices: A Memoir&quot; in 1983, advertised as a record of his encounters with some of the century&#x27;s leading artists and writers, returned Prokosch to the limelight. His early novels &quot;The Asiatics&quot; and &quot;The Seven Who Fled&quot; were reissued to much public acclaim. In 2010, &quot;Voices&quot; was shown to be almost wholly fictitious and part of an enormous hoax. Prokosch died in Le Plan-de-Grasse, an area of Grasse, France.

==Literary work==
Prokosch&#x27;s novels &quot;The Asiatics&quot; and &quot;The Seven Who Fled&quot; received widespread attention in the 1930s. The action in both of these narratives takes place in Asia, a continent Prokosch had not visited but wrote about from his imagination and from books and maps. Landscape descriptions are so prevalent that the landscape often takes on the role of a character in its own right. Albert Camus said about &quot;The Seven Who Fled&quot;, &quot;Prokosch has invented what might be called the geographical novel, in which he mingles sensuality with irony, lucidity with mystery. He conveys a fatalistic sense of life half hidden beneath a rich animal energy. He is a master of moods and undertones, a virtuoso in the feeling of place, and he writes in a style of supple elegance.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic L. H. Titterton wrote about &quot;The Asiatics&quot;:
:&quot;Whether such adventures ever happened to any one man, or whether, as seems far more likely, the author has supplemented certain experiences of his own by a rich imagination, using as its basis information gathered through wide reading, is immaterial. For this is actually a quiet, meditative book into which adventurous episodes have been introduced simply as a device for displaing various aspects of the Asiatic mind and spirit. It is the work of a man of a deeply poetic nature possessed of an astonishing ability to describe in a few words a color, a scene, an odor, an emotional situation, an attitude of mind, an idea; words so well chosen that passage after passage seems perfectly to express some truth that we have many times, in a stumbling way, attempted to state.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Harold Strauss said about &quot;The Seven Who Fled&quot; (which won the Harper Prize):
:In singing, supple prose, with an evocative power strange to our earthbound ears, with passion and often with fury, Frederic Prokosch takes us off to the vast, mysterious reaches of Central Asia. It is a weird adventure of the spirit on which he leads us. For, mistake not, despite the apparently realistic description of the endless reaches of the desert, of the topless towers of the snow-capped mountains, of the huddling villages in which men rot away in poverty and disease, this Central Asia of Prokosch&#x27;s is not actual place upon the face of the earth. Like Xanadu, like Arcadia, like Atlantis or Aea [&quot;sic&quot;] or Poictesme, it is a phantom manufactured by a restless mind. ...Whatever the meaning of this book, and there will be much debate on that score, its wild lyrinative splendor and its profound emotional content mark it as a memorable novel.

After the 1930s, popular interest in Prokosch&#x27;s writing declined, but he continued to write steadily and to solidify his reputation as a writer’s writer with an elite following that included Thomas Mann, André Gide, Sinclair Lewis, Albert Camus, Thornton Wilder, Dylan Thomas, Anthony Burgess, Raymond Queneau, Somerset Maugham, Lawrence Durrell, Gore Vidal, and T.S. Eliot. “Pondering about Prokosch and his fate, I have come to the conclusion,” wrote Isaac Bashevis Singer, “that he is himself in a way at fault for being so woefully neglected. He has not cared to husband his natural riches... His roots are in this land. If Prokosch, like Faulkner, had limited his creative energies to one milieu, one region, he would certainly be counted today among the pillars of American literature.”

Among the most noteworthy of Prokosch’s latter-day writings are &quot;The Idols of the Cave&quot; (1946), a sophisticated story about a circle of aesthetes and socialites in New York City through the war years; &quot;Nine Days to Mukalla&quot; (1953), a dreamlike journey into the Arabian world; &quot;A Tale for Midnight&quot; (1955), a Gothicized retelling of the Cenci story; &quot;The Wreck of the Cassandra&quot; (1966), a realistic and poetic story of nine people castaway on a savage island; &quot;The Missolonghi Manuscript&quot; (1968), a “meditation” on the romantic artist; and &quot;America, My Wilderness&quot; (1972), an excursion into magical realism. Prokosch was named a Commander in the Ordre des Arts et Lettres by the French government in 1984 and awarded the Volterra Prize two years later. His novels have been translated into 15 languages.

<doc id="1107765" wikidata="Q1264716" url="?curid=1107765" title="Eagle's minimal essential medium">
<text>Minimal essential medium (MEM) is a synthetic cell culture medium developed by Harry Eagle first published in 1959 in &quot;Science&quot; that can be used to maintain cells in tissue culture. It is based on six salts and glucose described in Earle&#x27;s salts in 1934: calcium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate. The medium is further supplemented with thirteen essential amino acids, and eight vitamins: thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), nicotinamide (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyrodoxine (vitamin B6), folic acid (vitamin B9), choline, and myo-inositol (originally known as vitamin B8). Many variations of this medium have been developed, mostly adding additional vitamins, amino acids, and/or other nutrients.

Eagle developed his earlier &quot;Basal Medium Eagle&quot; (BME) in 1955–1957 on mouse L cells and human HeLa cells, with 13 essential amino acids and 9 vitamins added. BME contains biotin (vitamin B7), which Eagle later found to be superfluous. His 1959 &quot;minimal essential medium&quot; doubles the amount of many amino acids to &quot;conform more closely to the protein composition of cultured human cells. This permits the cultures to be kept for somewhat longer periods without refeeding&quot;.

DMEM (Dulbecco&#x27;s modified Eagle&#x27;s medium) was originally suggested as Eagle&#x27;s medium with a &#x27;fourfold concentration of amino acids and vitamins&#x27; by Renato Dulbecco and G. Freeman published in 1959. The commercial versions of this medium have additional modifications, see an example in the table below.

α-MEM (minimal essential medium Eagle – alpha modification) is a medium based on MEM published in 1971 by Clifford P. Stanners and colleagues. It contains more non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and vitamins (ascorbic acid (vitamin C), biotin, and cyanocobalamin) compared with MEM. It can also come with lipoic acid and nucleosides.

Glasgow&#x27;s MEM (Glasgow minimal essential medium) is yet another modification, prepared by Ian MacPherson and Michael Stoker.

The arrondissement of Béthune was created in 1800. The arrondissement of Lens was created in 1962 from part of the arrondissement of Béthune. At the January 2017 reorganisation of the arrondissements of Pas-de-Calais, it gained three communes from the arrondissement of Arras and one commune from the arrondissement of Lens.

As a result of the reorganisation of the cantons of France which came into effect in 2015, the borders of the cantons are no longer related to the borders of the arrondissements. The cantons of the arrondissement of Béthune were, as of January 2015:

# Auchel
# Barlin
# Béthune-Est
# Béthune-Nord
# Béthune-Sud
# Bruay-la-Buissière
# Cambrin
# Divion
# Douvrin
# Houdain
# Laventie
# Lillers
# Nœux-les-Mines
# Norrent-Fontes

It was established in 1997 by the Norwegian author Jostein Gaarder and his wife Siri Dannevig, and is named after Gaarder&#x27;s novel &quot;Sophie&#x27;s World&quot;.

<doc id="1107779" wikidata="Q7336808" url="?curid=1107779" title="Rittenhouse Square">
<text>Rittenhouse Square is a public park in Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that is the center of the eponymous Rittenhouse neighborhood. The square is one of the five original open-space parks planned by William Penn and his surveyor Thomas Holme during the late 17th century.

Together with Fitler Square, the Rittenhouse neighborhood and the square comprise the Rittenhouse–Fitler Historic District.

Rittenhouse Square is maintained by the non-profit group The Friends of Rittenhouse Square. The square cuts off 19th Street at Walnut Street and also at a half-block above Manning Street. Its boundaries are 18th Street to the east, Walnut Street to the north, and Rittenhouse Square West, a north–south boundary street, and Rittenhouse Square South, an east–west boundary street, making the park approximately two short blocks on each side. Locust Street borders Rittenhouse Square to both its east and west in the middle of the square.

==History==
===19th century===

Originally called Southwest Square, Rittenhouse Square was renamed in 1825 after David Rittenhouse, a descendant of the first paper-maker in Philadelphia, the German immigrant William Rittenhouse. William Rittenhouse&#x27;s original paper-mill site is known as Rittenhousetown, located in the rural setting of Fairmount Park along Paper Mill Run. David Rittenhouse was a clockmaker and friend of the American Revolution, as well as a noted astronomer; a lunar crater is named after him.

In the early 19th century, as the city grew steadily from the Delaware River to the Schuylkill River, it became obvious that Rittenhouse Square would become a highly desirable address. James Harper, a merchant and brick manufacturer who had recently retired from the United States Congress, was the first person to build on the square, buying most of the north frontage, erecting a stately townhouse for himself at 1811 Walnut Street (c. 1840). Having thus set the patrician residential tone that would subsequently define the Square, he divided the rest of the land into generously proportioned building lots and sold them. Sold after the congressman&#x27;s death, the Harper house became the home of the exclusive Rittenhouse Club, which added the present facade in c. 1901.

From 1876 to 1929, Rittenhouse Square was home to several wealthy families including Pennsylvania Railroad president Alexander Cassatt, real estate entrepreneur William Weightman III, department store founder John Wanamaker, Philadelphia planning commission director Edmund Bacon and his son, actor Kevin Bacon, as well as others.

===20th century===
Elegant churches and clubs were constructed by John Notman and Frank Furness. In 1913, French architect Paul Philippe Cret redesigned parts of the Square to resemble Paris and the French gardens, adding classical entryways and stone additions to railings, pools, and fountains.

After World War II, Rittenhouse Square&#x27;s Victorian mansions began to be replaced with high-rise residential and office buildings such as Claridge and Savoy. Vacant lots were converted to apartments and hotels. Still, some prominent Italianate and Art Deco buildings remain, and Rittenhouse Square has changed the least out of the city&#x27;s initial squares. Journalist and author Jane Jacobs wrote about two main ideas in Cret&#x27;s redesign: intricacy and centering.

In the mid-20th century, the park became known as a safe area for gays and lesbians to meet in Center City.

==Arts and culture==
Rittenhouse Square is surrounded by high rise residences, luxury apartments, an office tower, restaurants, and other businesses and residences. Its green grasses and dozens of benches are popular lunch-time destinations for residents and workers in Philadelphia&#x27;s Center City neighborhood, while its lion and goat statues are popular gathering spots for small children and their parents. The park is a popular dog walking destination for area residents, as was shown in the fictional film &quot;In Her Shoes&quot;. The Square was discussed in a favorable light by Jane Jacobs in her seminal work, &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;.

The Rittenhouse neighborhood is home to many cultural institutions, including the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia Youth Orchestra, the Ethical Society, the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library, Plays &amp; Players, the Wine School of Philadelphia, and the Civil War and Underground Railroad Museum. Delancey Place is a quiet, historical street lined with Civil War-era mansions and the setting for Hollywood movies, located only two blocks south of the square.

The square is home to many works of public art. Among them is a bas-relief bust of J. William White done by R. Tait McKenzie. &quot;Billy&quot;, the goat was created by Philadelphian Albert Laessle, who also designed the &quot;Penguins&quot; statue at the Philadelphia Zoo.

==Education==
Residents are in the Albert M. Greenfield School catchment area for grades kindergarten through eight; all persons assigned to Greenfield are zoned to Benjamin Franklin High School. Previously South Philadelphia High School was the neighborhood&#x27;s zoned high school.

The Curtis Institute of Music, University of the Arts, and Peirce College are all in the Rittenhouse neighborhood.

The Free Library of Philadelphia operates the Philadelphia City Institute on the first floor and lower level of an apartment complex at 1905 Locust Street; the apartment building is known as 220 West Rittenhouse Square .

==Transportation==
Rittenhouse Square is accessible via several forms of public transportation.

All SEPTA Regional Rail lines stop at Suburban Station, about six blocks north and east of the Square.

The PATCO Speedline, a rapid transit system connecting Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey, has its western terminus at 16th and Locust Sts., two blocks east of the Square.

The SEPTA 9, 12, 21, and 42 buses westbound run along Walnut Street. The 17 runs northbound along 20th Street and southbound along 19th Street and Rittenhouse Square West and the 2 runs northbound along 16th Street and southbound along 17th Street.

The SEPTA subway–surface trolley lines have a station at 19th and Market Streets, two blocks north of the Square. The Walnut–Locust station on the Broad Street Subway is four blocks east.

<doc id="1107783" wikidata="Q669257" url="?curid=1107783" title="HSQLDB">
<text>HSQLDB (&quot;Hyper SQL Database&quot;) is a relational database management system written in Java. It has a JDBC driver and supports a large subset of SQL-92, , , and standards. It offers a fast, small (around 1300 kilobytes in version 2.2) database engine which offers both in-memory and disk-based tables. Both embedded and server modes are available.

Additionally, it includes tools such as a minimal Web server, command line and GUI management tools (can be run as applets), and a number of demonstration examples. It can run on Java runtimes from version 1.1 upwards, including free Java implementations such as Kaffe.

HSQLDB is available under a BSD license. It is used as a database and persistence engine in many open source software projects, such as descendants of OpenOffice.org Base (i.e., Apache OpenOffice Base, LibreOffice Base, etc.), and the Jitsi VoIP and video-conference client since version 2.6. It is also used in commercial products, such as Mathematica and InstallAnywhere (starting with version 8.0).

== Transaction support ==
HSQLDB version 2.0 has three transaction control modes. It supports read committed and serializable transaction isolation levels with table level locks or with multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), or a combination of locks and MVCC. Version 1.8.1 supports transaction isolation level 0 (read uncommitted) only.

== Data storage ==
HSQLDB has two main table types used for durable read-write data storage, i.e., if a transaction has been successfully committed, it is guaranteed that the data will survive system failure and will keep their integrity.

The default MEMORY type stores all data changes to the disk in the form of a SQL script. During engine start-up, these commands are executed and data are reconstructed into the memory.

Another table type is CACHED, which allows one to store more data, at the cost of the slower performance. The HSQLDB engine loads them only partially and synchronizes the data to the disk on transaction commits. However, the engine always loads all rows affected during an update into the memory. This renders very large updates impossible without splitting the work into smaller parts.

Other table types allow access to comma-separated values (CSV) files. These tables can participate, for example, in queries with JOINs and simplify spreadsheet processing and read-write non-durable in-memory data storage.

== SQL features ==
HSQLDB 2.0 supports all the core features and many optional features of . Advanced features include user-defined SQL procedures and functions, schemas, datetime intervals, updatable views, arrays, lobs, full and lateral joins and set operations. Many non-standard functions such as TO_CHAR and DECODE are also supported. Extensions to standard SQL include user-defined aggregate functions.

== Releases ==
Several versions of HSQLDB have been released since 2001. Early versions were based on the discontinued HypersonicSQL database engine. Version 2.0, released in 2010, is mostly new code, written to conform to Standard SQL and JDBC 4 Specification.

Version 2.3.2 (released in 2014) is fully multi-threaded and supports high performance two-phase locking and MVCC (multiversion concurrency control) transaction control models.

<doc id="1107789" wikidata="Q6970853" url="?curid=1107789" title="National Awami Party">
<text>The National Awami Party (NAP) was the major left-wing political party in East and West Pakistan. It was founded in 1957 in Dhaka, erstwhile East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh), by Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and Yar Mohammad Khan, through the merger of various leftist and progressive political groups in Pakistan. Commonly known as the NAP, it was a major opposition party to Pakistani military regimes for much of the late 1950s and mid-1960s. In 1967, the party split into two factions.

== History ==
The NAP was founded in Dhaka in erstwhile East Pakistan by 1957.

The constituent parties in 1957 and their areas of influence were:
*The Bhashani-led faction which broke away from the Awami League
*Azad Pakistan Party a party led by Mian Iftikharuddin, Syed Kaswar Gardezi and Mahmud Ali Kasuri.
*Sindh Mahaz led by G. M. Syed and Sheikh Abdul Majid Sindhi.
*Sindh Hari Committee led by Haider Bakhsh Jatoi.
*Wrore Pukhtun (Pukhtun Brotherhood) a Balochistan-based party led by Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai and Hashim Khan Ghilzai.
*Usthman Gul (Awam Jamaat) of Balochistan led by Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Gul Khan Nasir and Prince Karim Khan of Kalat (princely state).
*Khudai Khidmatgar from North-West Frontier Province led by Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Hakeem Mohammad Aslam Sanjari. Ghaffar Khan&#x27;s son, Khan Abdul Wali Khan, also joined the party.
*Ganatantri Dal an East Bengali party led by Haji Mohammad Danesh of Dinajpur and Mahmud Ali of Sylhet.

The party President was Maulana Bhashani and the Secretary General was Mahmudul Huq Usmani. Mirza Mehdy Ispahani (aka Sadri Ispahani) was the treasurer. Afzal Bangash was the NAP&#x27;s General Secretary in NWFP.

The National Awami Party was along with the Awami League expected to easily win the 1959 planned general elections. Its primary target was the disbanding of the One Unit scheme in West Pakistan and a fair deal for the increasingly discontented people of East Pakistan.

===1958 ban===
In 1958, Ayub Khan came to power and all political parties were banned. The NAP was regarded by some as a front organization of the Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP) and it faced a harsh crackdown from the Ayub government. Hasan Nasir, NAP Office Secretary and card-carrying member of the CPP, was tortured to death in custody.

===Revival===
When Ayub allowed political parties again in 1962, the NAP was revived with all of its old components except the G.M. Sayed group and Ganatantri Dal.

===Party split===
At the end of 1967, a growing rift developed within the party, allegedly because Maulana Bhashani told his supporters to support Ayub Khan in the 1965 elections against the joint opposition nominee Fatima Jinnah. In return he was supposed to have received payoffs and favours, a fact which he never contradicted. On 30. November 1967, after a council session of the party in Rangpur, the NAP formally split into two factions:
*A pro-Chinese Maulana Bhashani-led faction
*A pro-Soviet Wali Khan-led faction

NAP (Bhashani) played an instrumental role in the secession of East Pakistan and the liberation of Bangladesh. After the death of Bhashani in 1976, his party lost much of its prominence on the Bangladeshi political scene. Many of its leaders became members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party under the leadership of Mashiur Rahman Jadu Mia. Today, the liberal and progressive faction within the BNP is led by former NAP leaders.

After the 1971 war, the NAP (Wali) became the principal opposition party to the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto-led government of the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party. The NAP (Wali) was banned after a relentless attack by the then Prime Minister Bhutto, who accused its leaders of treason and after a sham trial, the NAP was banned from Pakistani politics. The leaders of the NAP (Wali), including Khan Abdul Wali Khan, were only released during the regime of General Zia-ul-Haq.

== Political ideology ==
The NAP set the following as its main aims:
#Defence of the sovereignty, integrity, and independence of Pakistan.
#Non-aligned, independent foreign policy.
#Ending of exploitation of Pakistan externally and its people internally.
#Abolition of One Unit and reorganisation of provinces on a linguistic basis.
#Right of adult franchise.

In July 1965, as the manifesto was amended after the party&#x27;s re-emergence, the NAP declared that the system of government in the country should be based on the concept of people&#x27;s sovereignty. The Party advocated the maximum provincial autonomy in a confederal structure. Only Defence and Foreign Affairs were to be left with the &#x27;Federal&#x27; government, while other powers were to rest with the autonomous units. One-Unit in West Pakistan had to be replaced by a &quot;regional confederation where provinces would be created on linguistic lines&quot;. In foreign affairs the Manifesto asked for non-alignment and withdrawal from the military pacts SEATO and CENTO.

<text>The Bangladesh Communist Party (Leninist) (, abbreviated: BCP(L)) was a communist party in Bangladesh. BCP(L) was founded in Calcutta in the fall of 1971, by several small communist splinter factions. The core of founders of BCP(L) consisted of Kazi Zafar Ahmed, Rashed Khan Menon and Haider Akbar Khan Rono from the Communist Samanay Kendra, Amal Sen and Nazrul Islam from Communist Sanghati Kendra and Nasim Ali from the Hatiar group. Communist Samanay Kendra originated from the students movement and Communist Sanghati Kendra was a splinter group of East Pakistan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) that had revolted against the annihilation line.

Amal Sen was elected secretary of the party. BCP(L) projected itself as neither loyal to Moscow nor Beijing. BCP(L) had a close link with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from its foundation. In 1973 is formed part of the opposition alliance formed by National Awami Party (Bashani).

The party contested the 1973 parliamentary election. In 1974 BCP(L) launched the United People&#x27;s Party as their open frontal party. In 1979 Kazi Jaffar Ahmad left the party and joined Ziaur Rahman. In 1980, on the 102th birth anniversary of Iosif Stalin, BCP(L) merged with some other groups and formed the Workers Party of Bangladesh.

<doc id="1107799" wikidata="Q7268587" url="?curid=1107799" title="Quakers Hill, New South Wales">
<text>Quakers Hill is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is westnorth-west (WNW) of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown. Quakers Hill is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Quakers Hill is colloquially known as &#x27;Quakers&#x27;.

==History==
The first recorded cartographic use in NSW of the &#x27;Quaker&#x27; name is that of &quot;Quaker&#x27;s Row&quot;, today&#x27;s Church Street, Parramatta. In November 1788 a second settlement was established by Governor Phillip at Rose Hill and was renamed in June 1791, Parramatta. In July 1790 he laid out his plan for the town, with High Street (now George) the main road with another (143 feet / 43.6 m wide) starting at the south bank of the river where Phillip intended a town square with government buildings and an extended wharf. This he named Quakers Row.

Alan Sharpe, in his &quot;Pictorial History Blacktown and District&quot; (referenced below) on page 84 has no mention of the historic town plan of July 1790.

Development at Parramatta was swift, with the Rev Samuel Marsden establishing conformist religious services. The Quaker&#x27;s Row inhabitants were moved further west to The Quaker&#x27;s Hills, where they re-established themselves. It is said they were responsible for burying the dead in simple cairn marked graves that lay in the fields, paddocks and creeks who were all victims of the 1804 uprising and rebellion.

The name Quakers Hill was in an 1806 report of the area by government surveyor James Meehan. The origin of the name is unclear and the next references are more than sixty years later when Thomas Harvey used it for his property in what is now western Quakers Hill. When the railway station was built in 1872, it was called Douglas&#x27; Siding for over thirty years. The catalyst for the name change came with the subdivision of Harvey&#x27;s Quakers Hill property in 1904. The residents of the newly forming village preferred that name and in 1905, the name of the railway station was changed to Quakers Hill.

Postal services began in 1907 and the first post office was built in 1915. A school opened in the Presbyterian church hall in what is now Marayong in 1911 and Quakers Hill Public School took its first students in 1912. During the 1920s, the population grew dramatically, a number of shops opened in the area around the station and a public hall, the Empire Theatre, opened in 1925, screening movies and hosting dances. The village became a centre for the surrounding farms.

In the 1960s, Sydney&#x27;s suburban sprawl reached the Quakers Hill area and the five acre farms surrounding the village began to be subdivided. In 1994, &quot;HMAS Nirimba&quot;, a naval training property on the western side of the suburb, was decommissioned and converted into an educational precinct. In 1996, a new development in the north-east of Quakers Hill was converted into a new suburb, Acacia Gardens. In November 2020, the small portion of the suburb north of Quakers Hill Parkway became part of the new suburb of Nirimba Fields.

===Nursing home fire===

On 18 November 2011, an early morning fire at Quakers Hill Nursing Home killed 11 elderly residents, seriously injured others and caused the evacuation of up to 100 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH 18/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Three people died in the fire, and a further eight residents of the home died later in hospital from their injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Police 30/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The fire started in two places and was regarded by police as suspicious. A nurse working in the home, 36-year-old Roger Kingsley Dean, was charged for the fire and the deaths it caused and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

== Transport ==
Public Transport to and from Quakers Hill is provided by train and a number of bus services by Busways, namely routes: 731 (outskirts), 732 (west), 734 (outskirts), 745 (all over), 752 (all over) and 753 (south). Quakers Hill railway station is on the Richmond line. Bus services connect to Sydney Metro network at Tallawong, Rouse Hill and Bella Vista stations.

Quakers Hill has experienced much road development over recent years including the construction of a new road leading directly to the education precinct, bypassing the town centre. The Westlink M7, which links the suburb directly to all major routes in and out of the greater Sydney region, opened in December 2005. Following this opening the road overpass for the Quakers Hill Parkway has been widened from two to four lanes, including the bridge over the railway line, improving toll-free traffic flow between Richmond and Sunnyholt Roads.

== Housing ==

Quakers Hill has a blend of old and new developments. There are some Housing Commission houses (public housing) on the older (southern) side of Quakers Hill, mainly near Marayong. The western side of the railway line predominantly has houses on standard residential blocks, some built when HMAS Nirimba was an active naval base, others through the 1960s and 1970s. The eastern side of the railway line consists of dwellings constructed since the 1980s, with a high proportion of high density homes or townhouses.

== Education ==
Quakers Hill is home to numerous schools and educational institutions. The oldest is Quakers Hill Public School, opened in 1912. Two other public primary schools (Barnier and Hambledon) were opened in the 1990s to cope with suburb&#x27;s growing population. High schools in Quakers Hill are split between Quakers Hill High School, catering to Years 7–12, and Wyndham College, years 11–12. There is also a Catholic primary school (Mary Immaculate) and high school (Terra Sancta College). Post-secondary education is serviced by Nirimba TAFE College and the University of Western Sydney, Blacktown Campus. Four of these facilities (UWS, Nirimba TAFE, Wyndham and St John Paul II) are located together in the Nirimba Education Precinct.

== Demographics ==

Quakers Hill has become a fairly populated suburb, experiencing major growth in recent years. In 1991, the population was approximately 14,630 (1991 ABS Census) and in 1996, the population had grown by more than 4,000 people to 18,759 (1996 ABS Census). By 2006, the population of Quakers Hill had risen to 25,015. The 2016 ABS Census recorded a further increase to 27,080 people, with the 2021 census recording 27,893 people.

In the , the majority of people from Quakers Hill were born in Australia (52.8%). The second top response was India (15.8%). Most people identified as having an Australian ancestry (21.1%), followed by English (19.3%).

Most people from Quakers Hill identified as Catholic in 2021 (24.9%), followed by No Religion (18.6%).

<doc id="1107802" wikidata="Q3966833" url="?curid=1107802" title="White Bear and Red Moon">
<text>White Bear and Red Moon is a fantasy board wargame set in the world of Glorantha, created by Greg Stafford and published in 1975. Stafford first tried to sell the game to established publishers, but despite being accepted by three different game companies, each attempt ended in failure; eventually he founded his own game company in 1974, the influential Chaosium, to produce and market the game.

The game depicts the wars between the mighty Lunar Empire and the barbarian nation of Sartar, led by Prince Argrath, with many smaller countries and individuals available as allies to either side. Like other games of the board wargame genre, it has a hex map, many cardstock unit counters, and a number of rules themes.

&quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; went through three printings with minor differences. It was substantially revised and republished in 1981 under the name Dragon Pass, first by Chaosium and then in a nearly identical reprint from the Avalon Hill Game Company in 1983. The main differences in the reprint are a few streamlined rules and a notable improvement in the quality of the components. In particular, the paper map was replaced by a full-color game board. All editions are now out of print, and moderately valuable to a collector. A French-language edition was published by Oriflam under license from Chaosium under the name &quot;La Guerre des Héros&quot; in 1993. A Japanese-language edition was published by Hobby Japan.

&quot;Nomad Gods&quot; is another Chaosium board game that shares many rules in common, is set in a neighboring region of Glorantha, and can be regarded as a sequel of sorts. A planned third game in the series was never produced.

==Components==

The game components for the &quot;Dragon Pass&quot; version of this game include the box, a fold-out board map of the battle area, the rulebook, two sheets of die-cut cardboard counters, a player aid card, and a die. The game board is 22&quot; × 31&quot; and printed in color. The map is overlaid by a hex grid to regularize movement. At one end of the board is a turn track and several holding boxes for magical spirits and agents.

The map includes a variety of different terrain types, including forest, marsh, hills, mountains, fortresses, stockades, ridges, cities, ruins, and lakes. Each type of terrain has different effects on movement and combat. There are also roads, rivers, and fords that can alter the movement. The map is also divided up into several territories, including a number of independent nations.

This game features a great variety of unit types and nations, forming a colorful array of unit counters with a somewhat complex system of ratings and symbols. Some units represent troops, while others are individual heroes, spirits, or agents.

==Gameplay==
An unlimited number of units can be grouped together in the same hex to form a stack. Depending on the components of the stack and how it is ordered, most stacks exert a zone of control into the surrounding hexes. Units must cease movement upon entering an enemy zone of control, and a unit can not move directly from one enemy zone of control to another. Stacks that are currently disembodied do not exert a zone of control.

Each active player&#x27;s turn consists of the following phases:

* Move those units that are subject to random movement.
* Attempt to gain allies.
* Move any friendly units, and add replacements and reinforcements.
* Use any exotic abilities (such as magic).
* Resolve combat.
* Rally units that are disrupted.

Resolution of combat can include various types of magic, the use of missile fire, and finally melee combat. The combat results are in the form of Combat Factor losses, which is one of the ratings on the counters.

As is typical of many wargames, every friendly unit that is adjacent to an opposing unit must attack an adjacent opposing unit. Also each opposing unit adjacent to a friendly unit must be attacked. The exception to this is a unit inside a fortification, which is not forced to attack.

This game includes a considerable amount of chrome, simulating the variety of heroes, creatures, and magic that were involved in the battles. This can be an appealing factor to those who enjoy games with a fantasy atmosphere. Heroes and superheroes can have a powerful impact on the outcome of the various battles. The extra details can add complexity to what would otherwise be a relatively simple board wargame.

==Reception==
In Issue 14 of &quot;Perfidious Albion&quot;, Bob Latter found &quot;the physical value for the money must be exceptional, the graphics and components are excellent, the game is beautiful and imaginative, and any fan of Tolkien, Arthur or Conan and suchlike should not hesitate to rush to buy this.&quot; 

Sumner N. Clarren reviewed &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 5. Clarren commented that &quot;The game has been crafted with great skill and wit, rare in games today.&quot;

In his 1977 book &quot;The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming&quot;, Nicholas Palmer noted the game had &quot;Eight scenarios of increasing complexity; the total effect is highly complicated.&quot; Palmer also warned that the game required a large amount of luck, but also involved &quot;absorbing diplomatic possibilities of played with a number of participants.&quot;

Neil Shapiro reviewed &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 13. Shapiro commented that &quot;&quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot; is much better than just fantastic [...] It is a sub-creation as real as all mythology.&quot;

Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;White Bear &amp; Red Moon&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #1, rating it an 8 out of 9. Costikyan commented that &quot;&quot;White Bear &amp; Red Moon&quot; is less a game than a description of an entire culture. In a short rulebook, it provides an insight into the religions, governments, and ideologies of whole peoples; descriptions of weird and imaginative alien races; the rationales for several competing kinds of magic; and the biographies of the greatest heroes of the age. Further, despite its occasional awkwardnesses, &quot;White Bear &amp; Red Moon&quot; is an enjoyable and fast-playing game.&quot;

Forrest Johnson reviewed the 1980 revised edition, &quot;Dragon Pass&quot;, in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 40. Johnson commented that &quot;The rules for &quot;Dragon Pass&quot; are no cleaner than those for &quot;White Bear and Red Moon&quot;. After all this time, Chaosium should know better than to publish a game which has not been blindtested.&quot;

Steve List reviewed &quot;Dragon Pass&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #14 and commented that &quot;While in some ways it is less &quot;magical&quot; than its predecessor, it is a better product in general and can be appreciated by the average gamer and dedicated fantasy fan alike. Try it; you&#x27;ll like it.&quot;

<text>William Robert Rodgers (1909–1969), known as Bertie, and born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was probably best known as a poet, but was also a prose essayist, a book reviewer, a radio broadcaster and script writer, a lecturer and, latterly, a teacher, as well as a former Presbyterian minister.

==Early life==
He was born in Belfast and grew up in Mountpottinger in the east of the city. At school he showed a talent for writing and went on to read English at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast where he won a number of prizes for literary essays, graduating in 1931. On completion of his degree, he entered Presbyterian Theological College and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1935. He was first appointed to Loughgall Presbyterian Church, Loughgall, County Armagh, where he was minister for 12 years. In 1936 he married Marie Harden Waddell, a medical doctor who set up practice in the village. &quot;Awake! and Other Poems&quot; (1941) was given glowing reviews in Britain and America, although the first edition was almost totally lost when the publisher&#x27;s warehouse was destroyed in the London Blitz. His wife became ill (later diagnosed as schizophrenia) and they left Loughgall temporarily in 1943, she to seek treatment, he to write in Oxford. He returned to Loughgall after a year but resigned from his ministry in 1946 to take up post at the BBC in London as a scriptwriter for the newly established BBC Third Programme after being approached by Louis MacNeice and offered a post. He involved himself in the Regionalist movement among Ulster writers in the 1940s and 1950s and contributed to a number journals which were used as a vehicle for the regionalist movement such as &quot;Lagan&quot;, &quot;The Bell&quot; and &quot;Rann&quot;. He collaborated with Louis MacNeice in the unpublished &quot;The Character of Ireland&quot;.

==Later life==
Rodgers stayed at the BBC as a full-time producer and scriptwriter until 1953 when he went free-lance. He produced a highly innovative series of radio broadcasts on Irish literary figures: &quot;Irish literary portraits&quot;. He was elected a life member of the Irish Academy of Letters in 1951 to fill the vacancy due to the death of George Bernard Shaw and was a member of the Literature and Poetry Panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain and a board member of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. His wife died in 1953, following a period of illness. In the same year he married Marianne Gilliam (née Helweg) the ex-wife of his immediate boss in the BBC, Lawrence Gilliam. They lived in England until 1966 when Rodgers secured a post as writer in residence at Pitzer College, Claremont, California and later a lecturing post at California State Polytechnic. In 1968 he was awarded a life annuity of £100 by the Arts Council of Ireland as an acknowledgement of his distinction in letters and of the honour which his literary work had reflected on Ireland. He died in 1969 in Los Angeles and was buried at Loughgall, County Armagh.

<doc id="1107804" wikidata="Q2168523" url="?curid=1107804" title="The Famous Grouse">
<text>The Famous Grouse is a brand of blended Scotch whisky produced by The Edrington Group in Scotland. It was first produced by Matthew Gloag &amp; Son in 1896. The single malt whiskies used in The Famous Grouse blend include the Edrington-owned Highland Park and The Macallan. Its emblem is the red grouse, Scotland&#x27;s national game bird.

It has been the highest-selling whisky brand in Scotland since 1980, although Bell&#x27;s is not far behind in second place. As a standard price blended Scotch whisky, its main competitors in its home market are Grant&#x27;s, Bell&#x27;s and Teacher&#x27;s. The majority of its sales in the United Kingdom are during the Christmas period.

== History ==

Matthew Gloag was a grocer and wine merchant at 22 Atholl Street, Perth, Scotland. Gloag originally specialised on imported wines and ports from France, Spain and Portugal. When Queen Victoria visited Perth in 1842, he was invited to supply the wines for the royal banquet.

In 1860, his son, William Gloag, took over the company. Following the Great French Wine Blight the company began to look at creating its own blended whiskies around 1875. In 1896, William&#x27;s nephew, Matthew Gloag (1850-1912), took over the family business. He created a new blended brand called The Grouse in 1896. at this time the company was still operating from the grandfather&#x27;s premises but had expanded to occupy adjacent shops, jointly covering 20 to 26 Atholl Street. 

In 1905 the limited company of &quot;Matthew Gloag &amp; son&quot; was formed and the Grouse was renamed The Famous Grouse in the same year. Matthew Gloag&#x27;s daughter Phillippa first designed the label&#x27;s grouse icon. Only at this point did the company move to new purpose-built premises on Kinnoull Street.

In 1970, Matthew Gloag &amp; Son, owned by the Gloag family, was sold to Highland Distillers, after the death of the chairman, Matthew Frederick Gloag. The marketing and distributive power of the company saw Famous Grouse become the highest selling Scotch in Scotland by 1980 and the second highest selling in the United Kingdom. 

From the 1980s the brand began to be exported overseas, where it now sells over 2 million cases annually. In 1984, The Famous Grouse was awarded a Royal Warrant.

In September 2024, Edrington reached an agreement to sell The Famous Grouse to William Grant &amp; Sons, subject to customary regulatory approvals.

== Characteristics ==

The standard blend is 40% ABV.

The blend goes through a marrying process for up to six months at 46% ABV. It is mandated by The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) that, in order to call a whisky &quot;Blended Scotch&quot;, the youngest alcoholic component in the drink needs to be matured for at least three years. This implies that all single malt and single grain whiskies used to create any &quot;Blended Scotch&quot; must have been matured as prescribed for at least three years. If shown, the manufacturers must state the age of the youngest constituent malt of their whisky -- however an age statement is not legally mandatory for any scotch whisky, blended or otherwise. Blenders optimize a standard taste for their products by blending casks of varying ages among batches. Where there is no age statement the blenders need not worry the impact a relatively young cask&#x27;s whisky might have on said statement. Ageing is done in oak casks.

== Variants ==

In 2007 a peated special version of The Famous Grouse called &quot;The Black Grouse&quot; developed for the Swedish market was released. The packaging displays a black grouse in place of the usual red grouse. The following year a special version, meant for chilling, was released called &quot;The Snow Grouse&quot;. The packaging features a ptarmigan.

In 2011, &quot;The Naked Grouse&quot; was launched as its premium product. Initially as a high-end blended whisky, in 2017 it was turned into blended malt whisky.

== United States distribution ==
Suntory Global Spirits distribute The Famous Grouse and other Edrington brands in the U.S. market. 

== Promotions and sponsorships ==

The Famous Grouse has focussed its television advertising around the Christmas period since 1996.

The Famous Grouse was the primary sponsor of the Perth-based football team St Johnstone between 1986 and 1989 and again between 1991 and 1998. It also sponsored the Scotland national rugby union team from 1990 until 2007, and was &#x27;The Official Spirit of Scottish Rugby&#x27; from 2013 for three years.

In May 2014, The Famous Grouse was named the official whisky of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

<doc id="1107806" wikidata="Q4929585" url="?curid=1107806" title="Blue Nun">
<text>Blue Nun is a German wine brand launched by the company H. Sichel Söhne (Mainz) in 1923 with the 1921 vintage, and which between the 1950s and 1980s was a very popular international brand. For most of its existence, Blue Nun was a single German wine, which until the late 1990s was classified as a Liebfraumilch, but the name is now used for a whole range of wines of various origins. When it was created, the label was designed as a consumer-friendly alternative to the innumerable German wine labels with Gothic script and long, complicated names. With the creation of its UK office in 1927, Sichel targeted the export market. Beginning in the 1950s, Blue Nun was advertised as a wine that could be drunk throughout an entire meal, thereby eliminating the often intimidating problem of wine and food pairing. Blue Nun can be said to have been the first wine to have been produced and effectively marketed with an international mass market in mind.

After World War II, the brand became widely popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, selling for the same price as a second growth red Bordeaux wine. At its peak of popularity in 1984–1985, annual sales in the U.S. were 1.25 million cases, with another 750,000 cases sold in other markets.

During the 1970s in the U.S., a series of radio adverts promoting the wine were produced, featuring Stiller and Meara. Their ads were so effective, they boosted sales by 500%.

From the late 1980s, and more so in the 1990s, easy-drinking, semi-sweet German wines began to decline in popularity. Consequently, the brand&#x27;s popularity declined, and the wine began to be perceived as tacky and dated. This change was reflected in Blue Nun being the drink of choice of Alan Partridge, a fictional, over-the-hill British television and radio presenter. However, sales increased after Blue Nun was purchased by the Mosel-based German family firm Langguth, which bought the previous owners Sichel in 1996. They repositioned the brand, reclassifying it from a Liebfraumilch to a regular &quot;Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete&quot; (QbA), changing the grapes from Müller-Thurgau to 30% Riesling, and making it less sweet. It remains relatively low in alcohol at 9.5%.

==Brand extension==
From 2001 on, Langguth also embarked on a brand extension, and has introduced several other wines under the Blue Nun name, including a German Riesling ice wine, a Languedoc Merlot and a Spanish rosé. Sales in 2004 rose by 11% in the UK, but from a low base.

In 2009, Blue Nun launched Blue Nun Gold, a sparkling wine that contained flakes of 22-carat gold. It was hoped the drink would appeal to young women drinkers and would help position the brand differently.

==References to Blue Nun in popular culture and media==

===In music===
Afro Celt Sound System, in their song &quot;Rise Above It&quot; from the album &quot;Seed&quot;, refer to dancing at gigs with Blue Nun. According to the lyrics of the song, heartburn going cheap is the reward for dancing at gigs with a Blue Nun.

The Beastie Boys album &quot;Check Your Head&quot; includes a musical interlude titled &quot;The Blue Nun&quot;, in which a narrator describes a party held in the comfortable study in Peter Sichel&#x27;s New York townhouse, in which the guests compliment the wine. Peter Sichel was chairman of the Blue Nun company until it was sold in 1995.

On The Beatles song &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot; off the &quot;White Album&quot;, rattling noises by a Blue Nun wine bottle are heard as a result of a bottle&#x27;s resting on top of a Leslie speaker, which began to vibrate when Paul McCartney played a certain note on the Hammond organ. It is accompanied by a Ringo Starr drum roll.

Steve Jones, guitarist of the Sex Pistols, stated in his autobiography &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; that he drank at least two whole bottles of Blue Nun before the band&#x27;s infamous Thames Television interview with host Bill Grundy dated 1 December 1976.

===In print===
In the comic strip &quot;Achewood&quot;, two cats, Roast Beef and Ray, get drunk on Blue Nun during a road trip, describing it as &quot;the wine so bad it made the news.&quot;

In issue #6 of &quot;Deadpool Corps&quot;, Lady Deadpool warns Brank, talent scout for the Blue Buccaneer/Champion, &quot;If your spaceship is all shag carpeting and Barry White and Blue Nun on ice, you&#x27;re in big trouble. I&#x27;m not looking for that kind of evening.&quot;

In Jonathan Coe&#x27;s &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot;, set in Birmingham in the 1970s, Colin Trotter buys two bottles of Blue Nun to accompany dinner with the Chases, who arrive at the Trotters&#x27; with an identical bottle of wine.

===In television===
Heston Blumenthal experimented with carbonating Blue Nun using a Sodastream machine in one episode of his novelty cuisine series &quot;Heston&#x27;s Feasts&quot;. The programme showed interviews which gave the impression that people either preferred the carbonated wine to genuine champagne or could not tell the difference.

On the BBC television series &quot;Life on Mars&quot; (series two, episode four) Blue Nun is mentioned as the wine that will be served at a party hosted by a wife-swapping couple of which the sleazy husband is a murder suspect.

In the television series &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; (series 1, episode 4), Brian Potter offers his love interest some Blue Nun.

In the television series &quot;So What Now?&quot;, Lee Evans mentions that he will bring a bottle of Blue Nun to gain access to a party.

In the television series &quot;Gimme A Break!&quot; (season 1, episode 7) episode &quot;Your Prisoner Is Dead&quot;, the chief (Dolph Sweet), after previously shooting an armed convenience store robber in self-defense, takes in a session with a young novice priest (Jay Johnson) in the attempt of trying to find solace for his actions where at the end the priest offers him some Blue Nun, then quips afterward &quot;We can get Mother Teresa out of the fridge.&quot;

Blue Nun is comedy character Alan Partridge&#x27;s wine of choice. Andrew Neil, the host of the satirical current affairs programme &quot;This Week&quot;, made frequent references to Blue Nun, as one of a number of running jokes in the series.

In the &quot;Father Ted&quot; episode &quot;Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest&quot;, a promiscuous nun is described as &quot;Sister Imelda, the Blue Nun,&quot; punning on or blue comedy.

Jeremy Clarkson offered samples of Blue Nun to Germans on his mini series &quot;Jeremy Clarkson: Meets the Neighbours&quot; (series 1, episode 3.) Clarkson pressed them, demanded answers as to why Germany would produce this terrible wine only for export, and subject the rest of the world to it. All but one of the people interviewed were repulsed by the taste.

In the television series &quot;Still Game&quot;, episode &quot;Lights Out&quot;, the character Jack Jarvis, played by Ford Kiernan, asks the barman Boabby to serve a Blue Nun to Isa Drennan. played by Jane McCarry.

===In film===
Blue Nun is mentioned in the movie &quot;&quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;&quot; when a character asks his father if he &quot;give that bottle of Blue Nun you got&quot; to his probation officer.

Blue Nun is mentioned (disparagingly) in the horror movie &quot;Mardi Gras Massacre&quot; (1978).

<text>Santa Pod Raceway is Europe&#x27;s first permanent drag racing venue for and racing. Located in Podington, Bedfordshire, England, the drag strip was built on a disused Second World War Royal Air Force (RAF) airbase, known as RAF Podington; once used by the USAAF&#x27;s 92nd Bomb Group. The drag racing venue opened at Easter in 1966, and it is now the home of European drag racing and hosts both the first and last round of the FIA and FIM / UEM European Drag Racing Championship, along with the British National Drag Racing Championships. It has also been the venue for the annual Volkswagen Beetle Bug Jam weekend since 1987.

==History==
Podington airfield, near the villages of Hinwick and Podington, was formerly a Second World War airbase. In 1966, permission was obtained to use the airfield as a drag racing complex, the main runway being used as the drag strip. Santa Pod was named after Santa Ana Drags, a drag strip in California, USA, and the local village of Podington. Since then, the name Santa Pod has become synonymous with the sport of drag racing in Europe. Informally known as &#x27;The Pod&#x27;, today the raceway hosts events throughout the year, including the FIA European Drag Racing Championships and the &#x27;Run What You Brung&#x27; (RWYB) events where anyone with a valid driving licence can have a go and put their own vehicles and skills to the test. This also serves as a &#x27;grassroots&#x27; recruitment ground, as many who start by running their road vehicle on the track for bragging rights often progress to the next level and become competitors in National Events after obtaining a licence from one of the official sanctioning bodies; Auto-Cycle Union or Motorsport UK.
Santa Pod is the venue at which the current world drag racing record, a time of 3.58 seconds at was set by Sammy Miller in his Vanishing Point rocket-propelled funny car in July 1984. Another record has also been set at Santa Pod, the world&#x27;s fastest jet car (notably Santa Pod&#x27;s &#x27;resident&#x27;) Fireforce 3 piloted by Martin Hill broke the record in Easter 2005 with a terminal speed of . Several other European drag racing records have been set, along with records unsurpassed outside the United States. In May 2010, Top Fuel dragster driver Urs Erbacher set a class speed record with a terminal speed of reached in less than 5 seconds. At the same race meeting, Eric Teboul set a time of 5.2321 seconds at on his Hydrogen Peroxide Rocket Bike, which he further improved to 5.19 seconds at the European championships in September 2010. In 2012, drag-racer Andy Frost set the record of &#x27;the world&#x27;s fastest accelerating road-legal car&#x27; at the UK&#x27;s Santa Pod Raceway. In September 2010, 47-year-old Briton Perry Watkins drove a racing vehicle, a 1994 Reliant Scimitar Sabre, decorated as a formal Queen Anne style dining table, complete with tablecloth, chairs, place settings, food and various vessels. The vehicle was dubbed the &#x27;Fast Food&#x27;. It performed two runs at Santa Pod, topping out at and achieving an average speed of .

Santa Pod for many years remained the fastest all-asphalt dragstrip in the world, since most North American tracks are partially or entirely concrete in construction. However, during the winter of 2017/2018, the entire length of the track was lifted and replaced with a track constructed entirely in concrete, the reasoning being that concrete gives more consistent times as it, &quot;moves around less&quot; than asphalt.
Since 1987, it has hosted the annual Bug Jam weekend.

==In popular culture==
Santa Pod appears in Led Zeppelin&#x27;s concert film &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;. Drummer John Bonham drove a dragster at the raceway for his fantasy sequence in the film.

<text>RKC Waalwijk () is a Dutch professional football club based in Waalwijk, that is currently competing in the Eredivisie. Its name is derived from &#x27;Rooms Katholieke Combinatie Waalwijk&#x27; (&#x27;Roman Catholic Combination Waalwijk&#x27; in Dutch) and was established as a merger of HEC, WVB and Hercules.

==History==
The club was formed on 26 August 1940 and used to play its home games at Sportpark Olympia. Its new stadium, the 7,500 seater Mandemakers Stadion was opened in 1996 and featured the home match against Roda JC. RKC&#x27;s clubname was also expanded with the name of the town before that 1996–97 season. While considered one of the Eredivisie&#x27;s smaller clubs, it nevertheless maintained its top flight status for many years. Its home colors are yellow and blue.

At the end of the 2006–07 season, RKC Waalwijk were relegated from the Eredivisie after a defeat in play-offs against VVV-Venlo.

On 3 June 2009 they were promoted to the Eredivisie division after a win in the play-offs against De Graafschap. Though, their spell didn&#x27;t last long ending in the last place with only 15 points. In the season followed they would finish first in the Eerste Divisie promoting back in the top flight of Dutch football.

After another relegation at the end of the 2013–14 season, RKC Waalwijk finished 20th (last) in the 2014–15 season of Eerste Divisie. However, they didn&#x27;t relegate to Topklasse (amateurs) because both of the two Topklasse champions declined promotion into professionalism. In 2016–17, they made the Eerste Divisie playoffs, losing 5–2 on aggregate to FC Emmen.

In the 2017–18 season, RKC was placed 16th out of 20 teams in the Eerste Divisie. In 2019, Waalwijk promoted back to the Eredivisie after a five-year absence, after beating Go Ahead Eagles in the play-off finals. After a 0–0 draw in the first leg at home, RKC won the second leg 4–5 away.

In the 2019–20 season, RKC finished in last place, but they survived relegation due to the season being declared void due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the subsequent 2020–21 season, the club managed to avoid relegation on their own by finishing in 15th place.

<doc id="1107832" wikidata="Q7020322" url="?curid=1107832" title="Newton N. Minow">
<text>Newton Norman Minow (January 17, 1926 – May 6, 2023) was an American attorney who served as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. He is famous for his 1961 speech referring to television as a &quot;vast wasteland&quot;. While still maintaining a law practice, Minow served as the honorary consul general of Singapore in Chicago, beginning in 2001.

Minow was active in Democratic Party politics. He was an attorney in private practice concerning telecommunications law and was active in many nonprofit, civic, and educational institutions. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 by Barack Obama, whom he had known since the start of Obama&#x27;s legal career.

==Background and early law career==
Born to a Jewish family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1926, Minow served in World War II from 1944 to 1946 and attained the rank of a sergeant in the U.S. Army. He served in the China Burma India Theater with the 835th Signal Service Battalion headquartered in New Delhi, India. After the war, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1949 from Northwestern University and a Juris Doctor degree in 1950 from Northwestern University School of Law. 

After graduating from law school, Minow worked for the law firm of Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt (1950–1951 and 1953–1955) before becoming a law clerk to Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson of the U.S. Supreme Court (1951–1952). He later became assistant counsel to Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson (1952–1953), worked for Stevenson&#x27;s two presidential campaigns (1952 and 1956), and then was a partner in the law firm, Stevenson, Rifkind &amp; Wirtz (1955–1961). Minow campaigned for President John F. Kennedy prior to the 1960 U.S. presidential election. In 1961 he was appointed by President Kennedy to be one of seven commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as well as its chairman.

==Federal Communications Commission chairman==

Reportedly, Robert F. Kennedy and Minow frequently talked at length about the increasing importance of television in the lives of their children when they worked together on the presidential campaign of Adlai E. Stevenson. Thereafter, it came as little surprise that after the election of John F. Kennedy Minow eagerly pursued the position of FCC chairman. Some observers nevertheless considered it unusual given his lack of experience with the media industry and with communication law. He served as chairman from March 2, 1961, through June 1, 1963.

===Criticism and evaluation===

Minow became one of the best-known and respected—if sometimes controversial—political figures of the early 1960s because of his criticism of commercial television. In a speech given to the National Association of Broadcasters convention on May 9, 1961, he was extremely critical of television broadcasters for not doing more, in Minow&#x27;s view, to serve the public interest. His phrase &quot;vast wasteland&quot; is remembered years after the speech in which he said:

While some applauded his &quot;vast wasteland&quot; assault on commercial television as a welcome criticism of excessive violence and frivolity, others criticized it as an elitist, snobbish attack on programming that many viewers enjoyed as well as a government intrusion into private enterprise. The S.S. &quot;Minnow&quot; of the 1964–67 television show &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; was reputedly sarcastically named after him to express displeasure with his assessment of the quality of television.

In a 2011 speech at Harvard, Minow said that he could never have anticipated the impact of television. He still felt that news is the most important public service, but that television continued to fall short in that area. &quot;Too much deals with covering controversy, crimes, fires, and not enough with the country&#x27;s great issues&quot; he said. He also said that presidential campaigns are obsessed with the trivial. The speech came 50 years after he referred to television as a &quot;vast wasteland&quot; on May 9, 1961. The day after the 1961 speech, the &quot;New York Times&quot; headline read &quot;F.C.C. Head Bids TV Men Reform &#x27;Vast Wasteland&#x27;—Minow Charges Failure in Public Duty—Threatens to Use License Power&quot;.

===Achievements at the Federal Communications Commission===
Minow did foster two significant initiatives that altered the landscape of American television. The first was the All-Channel Receiver Act (ACRA) of 1961, which mandated UHF reception capability for all television receivers sold in the United States. This legislation sparked an increase in the number of television stations and helped launch nonprofit educational television stations (now PBS) throughout the country.

Minow said that his greatest contribution was persuading U. S. Congress to pass legislation clearing the way for communications satellites. Minow recounted, &quot;When I toured the space program with [John F.] Kennedy, he was surprised to see me&quot;. Minow told Kennedy that &quot;communications satellites will be much more important than sending man into space, because they will send ideas into space. Ideas last longer than men.&quot;

During his two years in office, it was estimated that, other than the president, Minow generated more column inches of news coverage than any other federal official. He also promoted what ultimately became the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (Intelsat). This organization controlled satellite communications for many years.

Minow&#x27;s papers from his tenure at the FCC are archived at the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research, an organization co-sponsored by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin Historical Society.

Quote from a speech to the Association of American Law Schools:

After 35 years, I have finished a comprehensive study of European comparative law. In Germany, under the law, everything is prohibited, except that which is permitted. In France, under the law, everything is permitted, except that which is prohibited. In the Soviet Union, under the law, everything is prohibited, including that which is permitted. And in Italy, under the law, everything is permitted, especially that which is prohibited.

==Subsequent communications work==
Minow sat on the Board of Governors of the Public Broadcasting Service and its predecessor, National Educational Television serving from 1973 to 1980 and serving as its chairman from 1978 to 1980. He served out a tenure as the president of the Carnegie Corporation, a PBS sponsor, and the original funder of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

Minow was the Walter Annenberg professor emeritus at Northwestern University. He also authored four books and numerous professional journal and magazine articles. Minow supported and wrote about the Digital Promise Project, a project to fulfill the educational potential of the internet.

==Sidley Austin LLP==
Minow was the senior counsel in the Chicago-headquartered law firm of Sidley Austin LLP, a large international law firm with multiple areas of expertise, including telecommunications-related law. Between 1965 and 1991, he was a managing partner in the firm before becoming senior counsel in 1991.

== Honorary consul general of the Republic of Singapore ==
Minow&#x27;s early contact with Singapore and Singaporean officials was through his law work at Sidley Austin, which opened a Singapore office in 1982. Even when he was FCC chairman, he worried about the increasing export of Hollywood programming overseas and the impact it would have on perceptions of the United States among citizens in other countries.

Minow was appointed honorary consul general in 2001. The office he was associated with processes consular and visa applications.

== Contemporary politics ==
Minow was a prominent supporter of Barack Obama&#x27;s candidacy for President of the United States. Minow recruited Obama in 1988 to work for his law firm Sidley Austin LLP as a summer associate, where Obama met his future wife Michelle Robinson. Minow pursued Obama on the recommendation of his daughter Martha, who was one of Barack Obama&#x27;s law professors.

According to Michelle Obama&#x27;s book &quot;Becoming&quot;, Minow and his wife &quot;busted&quot; then Michelle Robinson and Barack Obama—both still associates at Sidley Austin—on their first date, greeting them &quot;warmly&quot; in the popcorn line at the Water Tower Place cinema, before the new couple saw Spike Lee&#x27;s movie, &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot;. Robinson and Obama had wanted to keep their relationship a secret from colleagues at the firm; Minow only &quot;smiled&quot; and &quot;made no comment&quot; at the fact they were together.

Minow supported Republican Bruce Rauner in the 2014 Illinois gubernatorial election, despite his history in Democratic politics. He said his vote was a response to the poor track record of Democratic governance in Illinois.

== Awards and corporate work ==
Minow sat on the board of directors at Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications Inc.; Tribune Co.; Manpower, Inc.; AON Corp.; CBS, and the Sara Lee Corporation. He was chairman of the Board at the RAND Corporation. He was a trustee of the Chicago Orchestral Association as well as with the Mayo Foundation, which operates the Mayo Clinic. He was a life trustee of Northwestern University and the University of Notre Dame, where he was the first Jewish member of the board, and at the time of his death he was the chairman of the Board of the World Health Imaging, Telemedicine and Informatics Alliance. He co-chaired the 1976 and 1980 presidential debates and was a vice-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates. He served on numerous presidential commissions and was chairman of a special advisory committee to the Secretary of Defense on protecting civil liberties in the fight against terrorism. His book on the history of the presidential debates was released in 2008.

Minow was the recipient of 12 honorary degrees. He was a recipient of the Peabody Award in 1961 and the Woodrow Wilson Award for public service. He was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1963 to 1976.

Minow was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois, Pat Quinn in 2014 in the area of Government &amp; Law.

Between 2015 and 2018, Minow served as a member of the Executive Advisory Council of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), after which, his daughter Mary Minow joined the council. In 2020, the AAPB launched the &#x27;Broadcasting in the Public Interest: The Newton Minow Collection&#x27; to honor Minow&#x27;s role in developing noncommercial television. The collection includes interviews, panels, testimonies, events, and profiles featuring him between 1961 and 2016.

Minow received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama on November 22, 2016.

==Personal life==
Minow married Josephine Baskin in 1949. They had three daughters, all trained as lawyers; Nell Minow, shareholder activist and movie critic; Martha L. Minow, law professor and former dean of Harvard Law School; and Mary, a library law expert appointed to the Obama administration. Josephine Baskin Minow died on February 17, 2022, at age 95.

Minow was a great-uncle to Adam Frankel, a speechwriter of his former protege, Barack Obama. Josephine Minow&#x27;s older sister, Irene, is Frankel&#x27;s paternal grandmother.

<text>John Francis &quot;Jack&quot; Trout (January 31, 1935 – June 4, 2017) was an American advertising executive and an owner of Trout &amp; Partners, a consulting firm. He was the founder and pioneer of positioning theory and also marketing warfare theory.

==Career==
Trout started his business career in the advertising department of General Electric. From there he went on to become a divisional advertising manager at Uniroyal. He then joined Al Ries in the advertising agency and marketing strategy firm where they worked together for over twenty-six years.

He was the founder and president of the international marketing strategy firm &quot;Trout and Partners&quot;. The firm is represented in offices in many countries worldwide including emerging markets. Trout worked with a number of different client companies, including AT&amp;T, Apple, Citicorp, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, Southwest Airlines, and Xerox. When working with pizza chain Papa John&#x27;s, Trout was majorly involved in the invention of the chain&#x27;s slogan &quot;better ingredients, better pizza.&quot;

In the fall of 2002, Trout began working with the United States Department of State in order to &quot;train new diplomats in the art of projecting a positive image of America overseas&quot; as a part of the &quot;Brand America&quot; campaign, which sought to improve public opinion about the upcoming Iraq War.

Trout died of intestinal cancer at his home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 82.

==Family==
He was survived by his wife Patricia, their six children and 15 grandchildren, and four siblings.

<doc id="1107837" wikidata="Q1413953" url="?curid=1107837" title="Ranger Uranium Mine">
<text>The Ranger Uranium Mine was a uranium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia. The site is surrounded by, but separate from Kakadu National Park, 230 km east of Darwin. The orebody was discovered in late 1969, and the mine commenced operation in 1980, reaching full production of uranium oxide in 1981 and ceased stockpile processing on 8 January 2021. Mining activities had ceased in 2012. It was owned and operated by Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), a public company 86.33% owned by Rio Tinto Group, the remainder held by the public. Uranium mined at Ranger was sold for use in nuclear power stations in Japan, South Korea, China, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the United States.

The original Ranger 1 orebody was mined out by the end of 1995, although some ore remained stockpiled. A second orebody, Ranger 3, began mining in 1997. Both were open-pit mines. Mining finished at Ranger in late 2012, efforts to exploit Ranger 3 Deeps failed, and the mine plant processed some stockpiled ore until January 2021. ERA has tenure and access to the site, principally for rehabilitation activities, until 8 January 2026.

==Discovery==
The Ranger uranium orebody, the richest in the southern hemisphere, was discovered in late 1969, when an aerial radiometric survey conducted by Geophysical Resources Development Co., a company based in Sydney, on contract to Noranda Aluminum, detected a large spike in gamma radiation when passing over Mount Brockman, known as Djidbidjidbi to the Mirarr traditional owners of the area. The instrument that detected the anomaly was a Nuclear Enterprises gamma ray spectrometer using a Thallium doped Sodium Iodide cylindrical crystal. At time of discovery the aircraft was flying at an altitude of . The anomaly could still be detected at almost . The crew members on board were Bill Hay, the pilot, Harvey Morton, the navigator and Frank Lanza, the instruments operator, who first recognised the significance of the anomaly.

==Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry==
In 1975, Gough Whitlam appointed Justice Russell Fox, a judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, to lead an inquiry into the environmental dangers posed by mining uranium in the Northern Territory and the associated risks of exporting it, including those of nuclear proliferation. The inquiry produced two reports, published in 1976 and 1977.

==Ore bodies==
The Ranger No. 1 and Ranger No. 3 ore bodies occur in the Cahill Formation, consisting of Lower Proterozoic metasediments, located in the Alligator Rivers Uranium Field. The mine commenced operation in 1980, reaching full production of uranium oxide in 1981. Owing to the environmental sensitivity of the site, a special statutory authority, the Supervising Scientist, was created to provide oversight of the operation and conduct environmental research in the region.

Ranger mine covers two of a line of uranium orebodies that extend from near Nourlangie Rock in Kakadu north-eastwards to Koongarra, underneath Mount Brockman, then northwards through the Ranger One line of orebodies (in order Number 2, Number 1, and Number 3), then via Hades Flat, where there is uranium mineralisation, to Jabiluka where the line turns westward through the Barote and Ranger 4 orebodies. The mine covers No 1 Orebody and No 3 Orebody. No 2 Orebody was excluded from the mining lease at the request of the traditional owners and included in Kakadu National Park. From Ranger 4 the line again turns northwards and then swings westward round an Archaean basement dome before turning south towards Nourlangie Rock again. Uranium mineralisation is known at several other places along this line but has never been explored in detail because of the creation of Kakadu. The name &#x27;Ranger&#x27; for the series of discoveries made by Geopeko, the exploration arm of Peko-Wallsend, in the period 1969 to 1972, was thought up by Judy Ryan, the wife of the geologist in charge of the program. Koongarra and Jabiluka were retained by the companies that found them: Noranda Australia and Pancontinental Mining respectively, although since sold to other parties. The other discoveries were enclosed in the National Park.

ERA was named Explorer of the Year at the sixth annual Australian Mining Prospect Awards held in Sydney in November 2009. During 2008, ERA&#x27;s exploration programme identified a significant mineral resource adjacent to the operating Ranger 3 pit. The area, known as Ranger 3 Deeps, ranked among the world&#x27;s most significant new uranium discoveries of recent years.

==Ranger 3 Deeps==
As production from the existing mines declined in the early 2010s, ERA constructed a $120 million Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline (tunnel) to conduct close spaced underground exploration drilling and explore areas adjacent to the Ranger 3 Deeps resource. This was never developed as of 2024. The Ranger 3 Deeps mineralised zone contains an estimated resource of of uranium oxide, comprising measured, indicated and inferred categories totalling 11.9 million tonnes of ore grading 0.274% U3O8.

New permissions would have been needed to mine this resource. In parallel with the construction of the exploration decline, ERA began a $57 million project to prepare a Prefeasibility Study into the potential development of a Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine. This Study determined the economic viability of the project, optimal mining methods, and metallurgical performance and production rates. Environmental studies were also conducted and published. ERA consulted further with the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation as a component of a broader social impact assessment.

ERA formally commenced the statutory approval process for the proposed Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine in January 2013 with the submission of a referral to the Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water Population and Communities under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Control Act 1999. At the same time, ERA separately lodged a notice of intent with the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority under the Northern Territory Environmental Assessment Act. However, as reported by &quot;World Nuclear News&quot; in 2021, &quot;Traditional owners of the land covered by the Ranger uranium project informed ERA in 2015 that they did not support any extension of the authority to mine in the project area. ERA decided not to proceed with a final feasibility study at Ranger 3 Deeps, which is an extension of the Ranger orebody. ERA today said it now expects to begin work to close the 2.2 km, 400-500 m deep Ranger 3 Deeps decline, excavated as part of those studies, during the first-half of this year.&quot;

== Ore processing ==
Ore was crushed, ground, then leached with sulphuric acid. Uranium was removed using kerosene with amine then stripped with ammonium sulphate solution and gaseous ammonia. Ammonium diuranate was precipitated by increasing the pregnant solution pH, and converted to uranium oxide (U3O8) in a furnace.

In early 2006, ERA announced an expansion to the processing plant which allowed production to extend into lower-grade ore and in November 2006 the company announced plans to invest in a laterite processing plant, which would allow it to process ore with a high clay content that has been stockpiled since the mine began operating. This ore had been already included in stated reserves. The laterite processing plant contributed 400 tonnes of uranium oxide per year from 2008 until closure.

== Water management ==
Water management is a critical component of ERA&#x27;s business, and between 2009 and 2012, it completed water management projects for a total cost of $82 million. This included surface water interception trenches around stockpiles to protect local waterways, installation of continuous real-time monitoring stations, and additional ground water bores to augment the extensive ground water monitoring programme.

In addition, ERA completed a 2.3-metre life of the Tailings Storage Facility, constructed a new pond water retention pond to store up to one gigalitre of pond water, and installed contingency water pumping system between the Tailings Storage Facility and Pit 3.
From 2012 to 2014, ERA expected to expend a total of $316 million in various water management projects including the $220 million Brine Concentrator Project. Brine Concentrators use thermal energy to evaporate water, which is subsequently condensed and discharged as clean distilled water.

The Brine Concentrator had the capacity to produce 1.83 gigalitres of clean water per year through the treatment of process water. Hatch was appointed EPCM contractor for the Brine Concentrator project. It was successfully commissioned in November 2013 with a budget of AUD $220 Million dollars.

In 2012, ERA and the Mirarr traditional owners represented by the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation (GAC), conducted a jointly facilitated independent expert review of the quality of surface water around the Ranger Project Area. The Independent Surface Water Working Group consisted of representatives from ERA, GAC, the Supervising Scientists Division and the Northern Land Council. 
Over a six-month period, the working group examined the impacts, monitoring and reporting of surface water flowing from the Ranger mine.

The working group agreed in findings released in March 2013 that the surface water management and regulatory systems in place at the Ranger mine were of a very high standard.
Going forward, the Group agreed an action plan to ensure that surface water management systems at Ranger remained &quot;best leading practice&quot;.

==Safety breaches and controversy==
Environment Australia (an agency of the Government of Australia) have documented over 200 environmental incidents since 1979. The great majority of these were minor, but the significant ones are detailed below. In 2013, a spokesperson from the Public Health Association of Australia claimed that there had been a hundred safety incidents linked to the mine in the thirty years prior.

In May 2005 the company was convicted for breaching environmental guidelines - the first such prosecution of a mining company in the Northern Territory, relating to accidental radiological exposure to ERA employees. Radioactively contaminated process water had entered the drinking water supply and some workers drank and washed in it. Dozens of mine employees were found to have showered in and consumed water containing 400 times the legal limit of uranium. The maximum radiation exposure of workers was likely to have been much less than the regulatory limit, and no harmful long-term health effects are likely.

Other incidents involving decontamination of vehicles have been identified. When the work-for-welfare mechanic in Jabiru opened the engine bay, he was unaware of the nature of the mud and dirt which fell on the floor. The court heard that in the following weeks, after he had swept the material outside his shed, his children played and built sandcastles in mud contaminated with uranium.

Another significant controversy over Ranger&#x27;s environmental impact is the public legal confrontation over releases into Magela Creek in the 1995 wet season. More recently, the ARRAC report from 2002 details a major leak of about 2 megalitres of potentially polluted water, over a number of months.

In 2007, water breached a retention pond, overflowing back into the pit. The original authorisation required that this water be contained at all times. In 2006, water management systems were disrupted by Cyclone Monica.

In May 2010, it was reported that a tailings dam may have released millions of litres of radioactive water into world heritage-listed wetlands in Kakadu National Park, home to about 500 Aboriginal people.

In November 2013, four drums previously used to transport yellowcake were found in a rural area of Darwin. The company recovered the drums amid concerns about the potential spread of radioactive contamination.

On 7 December 2013 there was an incident at a mine site inside Kakadu National Park, with about a million litres of slurry, comprising crushed ore and acid, believed spilled, workers evacuated and production shut down. A leaching tank containing the slurry burst at about 1am. The spilled material was entirely contained within the safety bunds and no material leaked into the wider ecosystem.

== Environmental justice issues ==
Ranger Uranium Mine is situated on the traditional lands of the Mirarr people of northern Australia and has been the subject of environmental and Aboriginal rights concerns. Although the Mirarr people, led by senior traditional owner Toby Gangale, opposed establishment of uranium mining, it began in the 1970s. In 1976, despite this opposition, the Australian federal government authorized the mine&#x27;s development, leading to concerns over the violation of Aboriginal land rights. Since then, environmental groups and Mirarr representatives have continued to oppose the mine, with the senior traditional owner Yvonne Margarula continuing to voice concerns about its lasting impacts. In addition to the environmental degradation caused by the mine, the Mirarr have also raised concerns about uranium from the site potentially contributing to nuclear accidents.

With mining operations ceasing in 2021, subsequent rehabilitation efforts have been closely monitored, particularly regarding corporate responsibility and Aboriginal land rights. Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), majority-owned by Rio Tinto Group, is legally required to rehabilitate the site to a condition suitable for inclusion in the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park. Concerns have been raised about whether the ERA has sufficient resources to fulfil its legal obligations, with some questioning whether the financial and logistical burden of cleanup will ultimately fall on the Mirarr people.

<doc id="1107849" wikidata="Q62570118" url="?curid=1107849" title="Miniatures game">
<text>Miniatures games are a form of tabletop game which prominently features the use of miniature models or figures.

==War games==
One of the oldest and most popular miniatures game genres is that of war games, where figures are arranged into competing &quot;armies&quot;, with figures that represent ranks of troops or individual combatants. Naval wargaming is a variation of play where figures represents ships and do battle on the seas. Early wargames were focused on faithfully recreating historical battles with units represented by chips, blocks, and other abstract markers. The modern genre has expanded to include fantasy and science-fiction settings, often using intricately-detailed and painted miniature figures.

==Miniatures in role-playing games==
Tabletop role-playing games evolved from miniatures games, and the two genres have continued to be linked in varying degrees. One of the most cited examples of this connection is &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which developed from a 1971 medieval miniature wargame called &quot;Chainmail&quot;. The first line of official &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; miniatures was produced by MiniFigs in 1976, and included iconic creatures such as Demogorgon. While the early editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; reduced or eliminated the use of miniatures, later versions reestablished their use as a core mechanism of the combat system. This even led full-circle into the development of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Miniatures Game&quot; which acted as a stand-alone skirmish game without role-playing elements and as a set of accessories which could be used during &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; play.

==Collectible miniatures games==

As a result of the popularity of the collectible card game (CCG) genre starting in the 1990s, collectible miniatures games were developed that made use of elements of CCGs, such as selling miniature figures in randomized packs, with certain figures being assigned different rarities. This led to a secondary market where figures were resold and valued based on either their utility for play or rarity as a collectible.

<text>The Lahaul and Spiti district is a high-altitude district in Himachal Pradesh, north India. This entirely mountainous district consists of two geographically distinct as well as formerly separate political-administrative units, called Lahaul () and [[Spiti]] (; or ). Lahaul and Spiti is the largest district by area in Himachal Pradesh, and one of the least populous districts in the whole of India. Kyelang (also spelled as &#x27;Keylong&#x27;) in Lahaul is the headquarters of the whole district, while Spiti also has a subdivisional headquarters, at Kaza. 

==Geography==

=== Physical ===
Geologically located in the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, Lahaul and Spiti district is connected to Manali through the Rohtang Pass. Lahaul has three valleys, the Chandra valley (locally known as Rangloi valley), the Bhaga valley (locally known as Ghar valley), and the Chandra-Bhaga valley (locally known as Pattan valley, and further on as Chenab valley). The confluence of the Chandra and the Bhaga rivers is at Tandi. The average elevation of Spiti is significantly greater than that of Lahaul. Lahaul receives much more rainfall than Spiti. 

&quot;Kunzum la&quot; or the Kunzum Pass (altitude ) is the entrance pass to the Spiti Valley from Lahaul. It is from Chandra Tal. To the south, Spiti ends from Tabo, at the Sumdo where the road enters Kinnaur and joins National Highway 5. Spiti is barren and difficult to cross, with an average elevation of the valley floor of . It is surrounded by lofty ranges, with the Spiti River rushing out of a gorge in the southeast to meet the Sutlej River. It is a typical mountain desert area with an average annual rainfall of only .

=== Administrative ===
Lahaul and Spiti district borders the districts of Kullu, Kangra, and Chamba to the south; Chamba to the west; Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh union territories to the north; Tibet (China) to the east, and Kinnaur district to the southeast. 

Lahaul and Spiti district is subdivided into two development blocks, Lahaul and Spiti. 

== History ==
=== Lahaul ===

==== Pre-modern and early modern ====

Lahaul was under the influence of the kingdom of Ladakh until the early 17th century. But the rulers of Chamba and Kullu also vied for control over Lahaul in that period. In the 17th century, Lahaul came under the influence of the Rajas of Kullu, particularly under the reign of Raja Biddhi Singh (r. 1672-1688) and his successor Raja Man Singh (r. 1688-1719). In the early 19th century, Sikh forces captured Lahaul. After the Anglo-Sikh War of 1845-46, Lahaul came under the rule of the British Raj.
==== Colonial period ====
Under British rule, Lahaul was made into a &#x27;waziri&#x27; of the Kullu sub-division of the Kangra district of the Punjab Province. At that time, Lahaul had three &#x27;jagir kothis&#x27; that pre-dated British rule: Kolong, Gumrang, and Gondhla. The heads of these &#x27;kothis&#x27; (revenue districts) were hereditary &#x27;jagirdars&#x27;, and held the title of &#x27;Thakur&#x27;. The Thakur of the Kolong kothi was made the wazir for the whole of Lahaul by the British. M.S. Gill remarks that the wazir was a magistrate, police officer, jailer, revenue collector, and forest officer all rolled into one. 
The first Thakur of Kolong to be given the designation of the &#x27;Wazir of Lahaul&#x27; was Thakur Hari Chand, who held this post from 1877 until his death in 1900. The second Wazir of Lahaul was Thakur Amar Chand, who held this post over 1900-1921. He was the son of Thakur Hari Chand. Amar Chand was bestowed with the title of &#x27;Rai Bahadur&#x27; by the British for his contributions to the British war effort in the First World War. The third Wazir of Lahaul was Thakur Mangal Chand (1886-1969). He was the younger brother of Thakur Amar Chand. Thakur Mangal Chand was the Wazir of Lahaul from 1921 until the time Thakur Pratap Chand (his nephew and a son of Thakur Amar Chand) achieved maturity. By the 1930s, Thakur Pratap Chand had become the fourth Wazir of Lahaul, and he would be the last. 

Some sources note that the waziri was abolished in 1941. Lahaul and Spiti were then combined to form a sub-tehsil of the Kullu sub-division, and Lahaul was now administered by a Naib Tehsildar posted at Kyelang. However, Gill notes that the wazir was not formally displaced; only his powers were reduced. Overall, this system involving the Naib Tehsildar and the Wazir continued till 1960, when Lahaul and Spiti were combined to create the Lahaul and Spiti district. 

Alongside agriculture and pastoralism, trade was an important occupation for Lahulis in the pre-Independence days. Alexander Diack noted in the late 19th century that at least one-third of the proprietors in Lahaul were engaged in trade. A major Central Asian trade route passed through Lahaul, connecting the plains of Punjab and the Kullu valley with Ladakh and Yarkand. Patseo, near Darcha (the last village in northern Lahaul) used to be the site of an important annual wool mart in the colonial period. It used to witness participation from traders and herders from Lahaul, Changthang, Tibet, Zangskar, Spiti, and Kullu, alongside Khampas and Gaddis. Many Lahauli would also annually go to Western Tibet to buy wool and pashmina for cash. 

During the colonial period, Keylong had a Moravian mission, which ran from 1853 to 1940. Famous missionaries who served in Keylong included Heinrich August Jäschke, August Wilhelm Heyde, and August Hermann Francke. The Moravian missionaries did not have much success in building a Christian congregation in Lahaul. But they are remembered for introducing several crops (including potatoes, turnips, lettuce, spinach, and cauliflower), the practice of knitting, newspapers, kerosene stoves, and flue pipes to Lahaul.
==== Early postcolonial period ====
During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48, three Indian Army officers from Lahaul, Thakur Prithi Chand, Kushal Chand, and Bhim Chand, who were all relatives, played major roles in defending neighbouring Ladakh from Pakistani forces.

==== Historical sites ====
Some historical sites in Lahaul include the monastery and fort at Gondhla, Triloknath temple, Shashur monastery, Khangsar palace, and Mrikula Devi temple.

=== Spiti ===
&quot;[For the history of Spiti, see the article on Spiti.]&quot; 

=== Lahaul and Spiti district ===
In 1960, Lahaul and Spiti were carved out and combined to create a new district, Lahaul and Spiti. In 1966, this district became a part of the then emerging state of Himachal Pradesh.

In 1972, Lata Thakur from Lahaul became the first-ever female Scheduled Tribe MLA in the Himachal Pradesh Government. 

== Flora and fauna ==

The harsh conditions of Lahaul permit only scattered tufts of hardy grasses and shrubs to grow, even below . Glacier lines are usually found at . Due to changes in climate, people in the Lahaul valley are able to grow some vegetables like cabbages, potatoes, green peas, radishes, tomatoes, carrots and leafy vegetables. The main cash crops are potatoes, cabbages, and green peas.

Some of the most common species of flora found in the Valley of Spiti include &quot;Cousinia thomsonii&quot;, &quot;Seseli trilobum&quot;, &quot;Crepis flexuosa&quot;, &quot;Caragana brevifolia&quot; and &quot;Krascheninnikovia ceratoides&quot;. There are over 62 species of medicinal plants found there as well. Several species of juniper grow in the valley, noted for their adaptation to the cold desert climate conditions. They are used by local people for religious purposes and for subsistence. The juniper forests are threatened by overuse and habitat degradation. The valley is inhabited by snow leopards, foxes, ibex, Himalayan brown bear, musk deer, and Himalayan blue sheep. Snow leopards are protected within the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. The Lingti plains are home to animals such as yaks and dzos.

Over-hunting and a decrease in food supplies have led to a large reduction in the population of the Tibetan antelope, argali, kiangs, musk deer, and snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. The locals of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals due to their religious beliefs.
=== Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary ===
Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary is the largest wildlife sanctuary in Himachal Pradesh. It is situated at an altitude of 3600m to 6700m, on the left bank of the Spiti River in the district of Lahaul and Spiti. It is sprawled over an area of 2220.12sq km. This cold desert area sanctuary was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1992. The fauna of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary includes ibex, snow leopard, blue sheep, and birds such as snow cock, griffons, and bearded eagle. The flora consists of Monkshood, Somlata, Pink Arnebia, Orchid, and Gentian.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, the Lahaul and Spiti district has a population of 31,564. This gives it a ranking of 638th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was -5%. Lahul and Spiti has a sex ratio of 903 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 76.81%. The entire population is rural. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 7.08% and 81.44% of the population respectively.

== Languages and cultures ==
% of the population speaks Kinnauri, % Pattani, % Bhotia, % Hindi, % Nepali and % Tibetan as their first language.

The language, culture, and populations of Lahaul and Spiti are closely related. Generally, the Lahaulis are of Tibetan and Indo-Aryan descent, while the Spiti Bhot is closer to the Tibetans, owing to their proximity to Tibet. The district has a Himachal Pradesh state legislative law in place to curb antique looting by travelers, given past incidents. In the pre-independence era, the ethnic tribal belt was divided into the British Lahaul and the Chamba Lahaul, which was merged with Punjab post-1947. This is the second-largest district in the Indian union.

The language spoken by both the Lahauli and Spiti Bhots is Bhoti, a Tibetic language of the Western Innovative subgroup. They are very similar to the Ladakh and Tibetans culturally, as they had been placed under the rule of the Guge and Ladakh kingdoms at occasional intervals.

Among the Lahaulis, the family acts as the basic unit of kinship. The extended family system is common and evolved from the polyandric system of the past. The family is headed by a senior male member, known as the Yunda, while his wife, known as the Yundamo, attains authority by being the oldest member of the generation. The clan system, also known as Rhus, plays another major role in the Lahauli society.

The Spiti Bhot community has an inheritance system that is otherwise unique to the Tibetans. Upon the death of both parents, only the eldest son will inherit the family property, while the eldest daughter inherits the mother&#x27;s jewelry, and the younger siblings inherit nothing. Men usually fall back on the social security system of the Trans-Himalayan Gompas.

The district has close cultural links with Ngari Prefecture of Tibet Autonomous Region.

== Lifestyle ==
The lifestyles of the Lahauli and Spiti Bhot are similar, owing to their proximity. Polyandry was widely practised by the Lahaulis in the past, although this practice has been dying out. The Spiti Bhot does not generally practice polyandry anymore, although it is accepted in a few isolated regions.

Divorces are accomplished by a simple ceremony performed in the presence of village elders. Divorce can be sought by either partner. The husband has to pay compensation to his ex-wife if she does not remarry. However, this is uncommon among the Lahaulis.

Agriculture is the main source of livelihood. Potato farming is common. Occupations include animal husbandry, working in government programs and services, and other businesses and crafts that include weaving. Houses are constructed in the Tibetan architectural style, as the land in Lahul and Spiti is mountainous and quite prone to earthquakes.

==Religion==


Most of the Lahaulis follow a combination of Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism of the Drukpa Kagyu order, while the Spiti Bhotia follow Tibetan Buddhism of the Gelugpa order. Within Lahaul, the Todh-Gahr (upper region of Lahaul towards Ladakh) region had the strongest Buddhist influence, owing to its close proximity to Spiti.

Before the spread of Tibetan Buddhism and Hinduism, the people were adherents of the religion &#x27;Lung Pe Chhoi&#x27;, an animistic religion that had some affinities with the Bön the religion of Tibet. While the religion flourished, animal and human sacrifices were regularly offered up to the &#x27;Iha&#x27;, a term that refers to evil spirits residing in the natural world, notably in the old pencil-cedar trees, rocks, and caves. Vestiges of the Lung Pe Chhoi religion can be seen in the behavior of the Lamas, who are believed to possess certain supernatural powers.

The Losar festival (also known as Halda in Lahauli) is celebrated between the months of January and February. The date of the celebration is decided by the Lamas. It has the same significance as the Diwali festival of Hinduism, but is celebrated in a Tibetan fashion.

At the start of the festival, two or three persons from every household will walk in the procession holding burning incense. The burning sticks are then piled into a bonfire. The people will then pray to Shiskar Apa, the goddess of wealth (another name Vasudhara) in the Buddhist religion.

== Tourism ==

The natural scenery and numerous Buddhist monasteries are the main tourist attractions of the region.

The dangerous weather in Lahaul and Spiti permits visitors only between the months of June to October when the roads and villages are free of snow and the high passes (Rothang La and Kunzum La) are open. It is possible to access Spiti from Kinnaur (along the Sutlej) all through the year, although the road is sometimes temporarily closed by landslides or avalanches.

=== Adventure tourism===
To-do-Trails:
The Spiti Valley is popular with trekkers due to the challenging nature of its treks. These treks take people to remote areas including rural villages and old Gompas, as well as wildlife trails. High-altitude treks allow travelers to cross passes such as Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hamta Pass trek, and Spiti Left Bank Trek. Popular trekking routes in the area include Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La, and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako.

<text>Arnolfini is an international arts centre and gallery in Bristol, England. It has a programme of contemporary art exhibitions, artist&#x27;s performance, music and dance events, poetry and book readings, talks, lectures and cinema. There is also a specialist art bookshop and a café bar. Educational activities are undertaken and experimental digital media work supported by online resources. Festivals are hosted by the gallery.

The gallery was founded in 1961 by Jeremy Rees, and was located in Clifton. In the 1970s it moved to Queen Square, before moving to its present location, Bush House on Bristol&#x27;s waterfront, in 1975. The name of the gallery is taken from Jan van Eyck&#x27;s 15th-century painting &quot;The Arnolfini Portrait&quot;. Arnolfini was refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 and 2005. Artists whose work has been exhibited include Bridget Riley, Rachel Whiteread, Richard Long and Jack Yeats. Performers have included Goat Island Performance Group, the Philip Glass Ensemble, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. The gallery reached a new audience in April 2010, when it was chosen to host one of the three 2010 general election debates.

==History==

Jeremy Rees started Arnolfini with the assistance of his wife Annabel, and the painter John Orsborn in 1961. The location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton, Bristol. In 1968, Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of private funding and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square, then to W Shed, later the home of the Watershed Media Centre. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated on the side of the Floating Harbour in Bristol City Centre. The first two simultanuous shows at the new location were by British artists Howard Hodgkin (ground floor) and Keith Milow (upper floor). The remainder of the building was office space leased out by developers JT Group.

Originally dedicated to exhibiting the work of artists from the West of England, under the directorship of Barry Barker (1986–1991) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art. Barker supervised a refurbishment of the gallery spaces and café bar by David Chipperfield. Before development work began, Arnolfini was attracting over 285,000 visitors per year. Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson (1991–1999), Caroline Collier (1999–2005) and Tom Trevor (2005–2013).

As part of a two-year development project that finished in September 2005,
the old warehouse has been redeveloped, adding another attic storey. Arnolfini now occupies the lower three floors and basement, and the upper floors are leased to help pay for the running costs. One tenant is the School of Creative Arts, part of the University of the West of England. Funding for this development was received from the National Lottery and the Barker-Mill Trust, set up by long term Arnolfini patron Peter Barker-Mill. The original committee to support Arnolfini included Peter Barker-Mill, Ann Hewer, and Lawrence Ogilvie.

In July 2015, Bush House was sold to the University of the West of England, with a lease-back of the artistic space. The profits from the sale replenished Arnolfini&#x27;s endowment fund.

== Bush House ==

The architect of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–1836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. &amp; A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstitial floors.

==Archives==
Records of Arnolfini, including a collection of artist books, are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 44371) (online catalogue).

==Name==

The Arnolfini is named after Jan van Eyck&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;The Arnolfini Portrait&quot; (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. &quot;The Arnolfini Portrait&quot; is one of the earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription in the middle of the work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall). One of Arnolfini&#x27;s consistent concerns is to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder&#x27;s favourite paintings.

==Today==
Arnolfini has three floors of galleries, a specialist arts bookshop, a cinema which can also be used as a performance space for theatre, live art, dance and music, a reading room that provides reference material for all past exhibitions, books and catalogues, and a café bar. Entrance to the galleries is free of charge. Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley, Richard Long, Rachel Whiteread, Paul McCartney, Angus Fairhurst and Louise Bourgeois. Events include poetry and film festivals, live art and dance performances, lectures and jazz and experimental music concerts, including Bodies in Flight, Goat Island Performance Group, Akram Khan, the London Sinfonietta, the Philip Glass Ensemble, Random Dance, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company.

There is an access and education programme, hosting visits from students, workshops with artists, presenting interpretative information and offering some work experience placements within the gallery. &quot;project.ARNOLFINI&quot; is an online experimental web site with dumps of digital media related to Arnolfini exhibitions and events, past and present, which may be reorganised by any online user, utilising resources on the web site to create new works and projects under a copyleft license.

Arnolfini also hosts events from outside organisations, including the &quot;Encounters Short Film Festival&quot; (along with the Watershed Media Centre), Mayfest, the first Festival of British Independent Cinema, the biennial Time Festival of Live Art and Intrigue and the Bristol Artists Book Events. In April 2010, British Sky Broadcasting chose Arnolfini to host the second of the three 2010 general election debates.

Arnolfini receives funding from Arts Council England, and Bristol City Council. According to returns lodged with the Charity Commission for the year ending in March 2016, Arnolfini had 500,000 visitors in 2013/2014. Income was £2.1 million and expenditure was £2.7 million and the gallery employed 44 people.

In 2017 the Arnolfini, which had asked for increased funding in recent years, will be losing its Arts Council England £750,000 annual grant after an assessment that the Arnolfini was &quot;not viable&quot; in its current model.

In 2017 a new director, Claire Doherty, was appointed. She aimed to devise a viable financial model. A show by Grayson Perry drew in more than 300 visitors a day.

In 2023, Arnolfini faced backlash after cancelling two Palestinian film events over concerns they would be construed as political.

<doc id="1107856" wikidata="Q1453971" url="?curid=1107856" title="Free Java implementations">
<text>Free Java implementations are software projects that implement Oracle&#x27;s Java technologies and are distributed under free software licences, making them free software. Sun released most of its Java source code as free software in May 2007, so it can now almost be considered a free Java implementation. Java implementations include compilers, runtimes, class libraries, etc. Advocates of free and open source software refer to free or open source Java virtual machine software as free runtimes or free Java runtimes.

Some advocates in this movement prefer not to use the term &quot;Java&quot; as it has trademark issues associated with it. Hence, even though it is a &quot;free Java movement&quot;, the term &quot;free Java runtimes&quot; is avoided by them.

==Mid-1990s to 2006==
The first free project to offer substantial parts of Java platform functionality was likely guavac, which began some time before November 1995.

Since then, the free software movement developed other Java compilers, most notably the GNU Compiler for Java. Others include the Eclipse Java Compiler (ECJ), which is maintained by the Eclipse Foundation, and Jikes, which is no longer actively maintained. Since the GNU Compiler Collection&#x27;s 4.3 release, GCJ (its Java compiler) is using the ECJ parser front-end for parsing Java.

Examples of free runtime environments include Kaffe, SableVM and gcj.

GNU Classpath is the main free software class library for Java. Most free runtimes use GNU Classpath as their class library.

In May 2005, Apache Harmony was announced, however, the project chose the Apache License, which was at the time incompatible with all existing free Java implementations.

Another event in May 2005 was the announcement that OpenOffice.org 2.0 would depend on Java features which free software implementations couldn&#x27;t provide. Following controversy, OpenOffice.org adopted a guideline requiring it to work with free Java implementations.

Notable applications that already worked with free software Java implementations before November 2006 include OpenOffice.org and Vuze, both of which work when compiled with GCJ.

==Sun&#x27;s November 2006 announcement==
On November 13, 2006, Sun released its compiler, javac, under the GNU General Public License.

As of September 2007, as well as javac, Sun has released the code of HotSpot (the virtual machine) and almost all the Java Class Library as free software.

Following their promise to release a fully buildable JDK based almost completely on free and open source code in the first half of 2007, Sun released the complete source code of the Class library under the GPL on May 8, 2007, except some limited parts that were licensed by Sun from 3rd parties who did not want their code to be released under a free software licence. Sun has stated that it aims to replace the parts that remain proprietary and closed source with alternative implementations and make the class library completely free and open source. Since there&#x27;s some encumbered code in the JDK, Sun will continue to use that code in commercial releases until it&#x27;s replaced by fully functional free and open-source alternatives.

==After the May 2007 code release==

As of May 2008, the only part of the Class library that remains proprietary (4% as of May 2007 for OpenJDK 7,

and less than 1% as of May 2008 in OpenJDK 6)
is the SNMP implementation.

Since the first May 2007 release, Sun Microsystems, with the help of the community, has released as free software (or replaced with free-software alternatives) almost all the encumbered code:

* All the audio engine code, including the software synthesizer, has been released as open-source. The closed-source software synthesizer has been replaced by a new synthesizer developed specifically for OpenJDK called &quot;Gervill&quot;,
* All cryptography classes used in the Class library have been released as free software,
* FreeType has replaced the code that scales and rasterizes fonts.
* LittleCMS has replaced the native color-management system. There is a pluggable layer in the JDK, so that the commercial version can use the old color management system and OpenJDK can use LittleCMS.
* The open-sourced Pisces renderer used in the phoneME project has replaced the anti-aliasing graphics rasterizer code. This code is fully functional, but still needs some performance enhancements,
* The JavaScript plugin has been open-sourced (the JavaScript engine itself was open-sourced from the beginning).

Because of these previously encumbered components, it was not possible to build OpenJDK only with free software components. In order to be able to do this before the whole class library is made free, and to be able to bundle OpenJDK in Fedora Core and other free Linux distributions, Red Hat has started a project called IcedTea. It is basically an OpenJDK/GNU Classpath hybrid that can be used to bootstrap OpenJDK using only free software.

As of March 2008, the Fedora 9 distribution has been released with OpenJDK 6 instead of the IcedTea implementation of OpenJDK 7. Some of the stated reasons for this change are:

* Sun has replaced most of the encumbrances for which IcedTea was providing replacements (less than 1% of encumbered code remains in the class library, and this code is not necessary to run OpenJDK).
* OpenJDK 6 was a stable branch, whereas OpenJDK 7 was unstable and not expected to ship a stable release until 2009.
* Sun has licensed the OpenJDK trademark for use in Fedora.

In June 2008, it was announced that IcedTea 6 (as the packaged version of OpenJDK on Fedora 9) had passed the Technology Compatibility Kit tests and can claim to be a fully compatible Java 6 implementation.

In September 2013, Azul Systems released Zulu, a free, open source build of OpenJDK for Windows Server and the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Later releases added support for Mac OS X, multiple versions of Linux and the Java Platform, Standard Edition version 8. Zulu is certified compliant with Java SE 8, 7 and 6 using the OpenJDK Community Technology Compatibility Kit.

Amazon have released Amazon Corretto a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of the Open Java Development Kit. It is released under GPL v2 with the Classpath Exception. Long-term support versions of Java 8 and Java 11 are available. It was first publicly released on January 31, 2019.

In 2017, the Eclipse Foundation released AdoptOpenJDK, now named Adoptium, whose main goal is &quot;to promote and support free and open-source high-quality runtimes and associated technology for use across the Java ecosystem.&quot;

<doc id="1107857" wikidata="Q6865766" url="?curid=1107857" title="Minister for Co-ordination of Defence">
<text>The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was a British Cabinet-level position established in 1936 to oversee and co-ordinate the rearmament of Britain&#x27;s defences. It was abolished in 1940.

==History==
The position was established by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin in response to criticism that Britain&#x27;s armed forces were understrength compared to Nazi Germany. This campaign had been led by Winston Churchill, and many expected him to be appointed as the new minister, though nearly every other senior figure in the National Government was also speculated upon by politicians and commentators. Despite this, Baldwin&#x27;s choice of the Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip provoked widespread astonishment. A famous remark was &quot;This is the most cynical appointment since Caligula made his horse a consul&quot;. The appointment is now regarded as a sign of caution by Baldwin, who did not wish to appoint someone like Churchill who would have been interpreted by foreign powers as a sign of the United Kingdom preparing for war, as well as a desire to avoid taking on board a controversial and radical minister.

In 1939 Inskip was succeeded by First Sea Lord Lord Chatfield. When the Second World War broke out, the new prime minister Neville Chamberlain formed a small War Cabinet, and it was expected that Chatfield would serve as a spokesperson for the three service ministers, the Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air; however political considerations resulted in all three posts being included in the Cabinet, and Chatfield&#x27;s role proved increasingly redundant. In April 1940 the position was formally wound up and the functions transferred to other Ministers.

The following month Chamberlain was succeeded as prime minister by Churchill, who took the additional title of &quot;Minister of Defence&quot;; this was, however, a separate office from Minister for Coordination of Defence, though the two titles were frequently used interchangeably.

<text>The Hornád (Slovak, ) or Hernád (Hungarian, ) is a river in eastern Slovakia and north-eastern Hungary.
It is a tributary to the river Slaná (Sajo). The source of the Hornád is the eastern slopes of Kráľova hoľa hill, south of Šuňava.

The river is 286 km long, with 178 km located in Slovakia, and the remaining 108 km in Hungary.

Cities along its course are Spišská Nová Ves and Košice, both in Slovakia. It flows into the river Sajó (Slovak Slaná) southeast of Miskolc.

Along the river are a series of six separate limestone rocky cliffs and steep slopes, which collectively make up the Site of Community Importance &#x27;Hornádske vápence&#x27;.

<doc id="1107861" wikidata="Q1351304" url="?curid=1107861" title="Eric Garcia (writer)">
<text>Eric Garcia (born 1972) is an American writer, the author of several novels including &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; which was made into a movie directed by Ridley Scott and starring Nicolas Cage, and the &quot;Anonymous Rex&quot; series, which was adapted in 2004 for the SciFi Channel. He is also a screenwriter, with Garrett Lerner, of the 2010 film &quot;Repo Men&quot;, based on Garcia&#x27;s novel &quot;The Repossession Mambo&quot;. He is the creator and showrunner of the non-linear Netflix heist series &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;.

==Career==
Garcia attended Cornell University to study English and film, then transferred to the University of Southern California during his junior year. His first novel, &quot;Anonymous Rex&quot; was published in 1999.

The second novel in the Rex series, &quot;Casual Rex&quot;, was published in 2001, and was a prequel to &quot;Anonymous Rex&quot;, a fact which was not on the book flap. The inclusion of characters in &quot;Casual Rex&quot; who were dead in &quot;Anonymous Rex&quot; confused many fans, who assumed that the book was a sequel.

In 2002, Random House published &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;, a novel completely different from Garcia&#x27;s prior work. Warner Brothers had already purchased the film rights and signed Ridley Scott as the director, with Nicolas Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman as the film&#x27;s stars. The film version, released in September 2003, received good reviews but was an average performer at the box office.

2004 was a busy year for Garcia. His third book in the Rex series, &quot;Hot And Sweaty Rex&quot;, was published early in the year, and in June, HarperCollins/ReganBooks published &quot;Cassandra French&#x27;s Finishing School For Boys&quot;, a hard-core satire of the chick-lit genre.

Also in 2004, the SciFi Channel showed the two-hour TV-movie pilot for &quot;Anonymous Rex&quot;, which was based on &quot;Casual Rex&quot; but kept the name of the original book. The show received negative reviews from both critics and fans and was never made into a series.

In June 2009, it was announced that Jude Law and Forest Whitaker would star in &quot;Repo Men&quot;, a movie co-written by Garcia with Garrett Lerner, a writer for Fox Broadcasting&#x27;s &quot;House&quot;. The movie is based on Garcia&#x27;s 2009 original paperback novel for HarperCollins, &quot;The Repossession Mambo&quot;.

As of 2010, Garcia has also written an adaptation of John Searles book &quot;Strange but True&quot;, a thriller to be directed by Alex and David Pastor.

In 2012, Garcia wrote and executive-produced produce a pilot for a TV series adapted from his novel &quot;Cassandra French&#x27;s Finishing School For Boys&quot; for MTV, along with actress Krysten Ritter as a fellow exec. producer. It did not go forward as a series.

In 2015, Garcia produced the horror film &quot;The Autopsy of Jane Doe&quot;.

In 2016, Garcia wrote and executive-produced &quot;Cassandra French&#x27;s Finishing School,&quot; an 8-episode series based on his own novel, and released by DirecTV and Fullscreen.

His adaptation of John Searles&#x27; novel &quot;Strange But True&quot; was produced in 2018, and was released in 2019 by CBS Films, starring Amy Ryan, Greg Kinnear, Nick Robinson, Margaret Qualley, Blythe Danner, and Brian Cox.

On January 1, 2023, Netflix released &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, a non-linear heist thriller on which Garcia was showrunner and creator. This is his second project with Ridley Scott, who is an executive producer on the show. Within its first 6 months on air, Kaleidoscope had over 252,000,000 hours viewed, and was the #12 most watched program on Netflix.

==Personal life==
Eric Garcia married his wife, Sabrina, in 1995, and lives in Southern California with his wife, his children Bailey and Teddy, and their dogs.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Alfred Ernle Montacute Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield, (27 September 1873 – 15 November 1967) was a Royal Navy officer. During the First World War he was present as Sir David Beatty&#x27;s Flag-Captain at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. After the war he became Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet and then Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet before serving as First Sea Lord in the mid-1930s in which role he won arguments that the Royal Navy should have 70 cruisers rather than the 50 cruisers that had been agreed at the Naval Conference of 1930, that the battleship still had an important role to play despite the development of the bomber and that the Fleet Air Arm should be part of the Royal Navy rather than the Royal Air Force. He subsequently served as Minister for Coordination of Defence in the early years of the Second World War.

==Naval career==
===Early naval career===
Born the only son of Admiral Alfred John Chatfield and Louisa Chatfield (née Faulconer), Chatfield was educated at St Andrew&#x27;s School in Tenby before he entered the Royal Navy as a cadet in the training ship HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; in 1886. He went to sea as a midshipman in the corvette HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot; in November 1888 before transferring to the cruiser HMS &quot;Warspite&quot;, flagship of the Pacific Station, in 1890. Promoted to sub-lieutenant on 27 September 1892 and to lieutenant on 27 March 1894, he joined the battleship HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, flagship of the Channel Fleet in May 1894. He attended the gunnery school HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; in 1895 and then joined the staff at the gunnery school HMS &quot;Cambridge&quot; at Devonport in August 1897. Chatfield became gunnery officer in the battleship HMS &quot;Caesar&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1899 and then joined the staff of the gunnery school HMS &quot;Wildfire&quot; at Sheerness in January 1900 before becoming 1st lieutenant and gunnery officer in the cruiser HMS &quot;Good Hope&quot; in the Atlantic Fleet in November 1902. Promoted to commander on 1 January 1904, he transferred to the battleship HMS &quot;Venerable&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1904.

He returned to HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; in March 1906 and, having been promoted to captain on 30 June 1909, he became Flag Captain of the battleship HMS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Colin Keppel, second-in-command of the Atlantic Fleet, in September 1909 and then Flag Captain of the battleship HMS &quot;London&quot;, Keppel&#x27;s new flagship in the same role, in February 1910. After attending the War course at the Royal Naval War College at Portsmouth, he served as Captain of the converted liner RMS &quot;Medina&quot; for the Royal Tour of India in 1911 and was appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as a Commander in February 1912. He was then given command first of HMS &quot;Aboukir&quot; in the Reserve Fleet in Summer 1912, then of the cruiser HMS &quot;Southampton&quot; in September 1912 and subsequently of the battlecruiser HMS &quot;Lion&quot;, flagship of Rear-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s First Battlecruiser Squadron, in March 1913.

===First World War===

During the First World War Chatfield was present as Beatty&#x27;s Flag-Captain in the &quot;Lion&quot; at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. It was at Jutland, after two British battlecruisers had blown up, that Beatty made his famous remark, &quot;There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today&quot;. Appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Companion on 31 May 1916 and to the Order of the Bath as a Companion in the 1916 Birthday Honours, Chatfield went on to command the battleship HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, Beatty&#x27;s flagship as Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet, in November 1916 and then the battleship , Beatty&#x27;s new flagship in the same role, in February 1917. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 5 April 1919.

===Senior command===
After the war Chatfield served as Fourth Sea Lord from July 1919 and, having been appointed Naval Aide-de-Camp to the King on 26 January 1920 and promoted to rear-admiral on 31 July 1920, he became Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff in February 1920. Chatfield attended the Washington naval conference in 1921-1922 that ended for the moment the mounting Anglo-American-Japanese naval arms race.

Advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1922 Birthday Honours, he was appointed Commander of the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron in September 1922 and Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy in April 1925. As Third Sea Lord, Chatfield became keenly concerned about the British shipbuilding industry, which went into contraction as the Anglo-German naval arms race had ended and the Washington treaty imposed limits on shipbuilding. Equally worrisome to him was the increasing cost of warships owing to technological innovation, which led him to express concerns that the necessary political will to spend millions of pounds upon the Navy was being eroded.

Promoted to vice-admiral on 1 March 1926, he went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet, with his flag in the battleship HMS &quot;Nelson&quot;, in March 1929 and, having been promoted to full admiral on 1 April 1930, he became Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, with his flag in the battleship HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, in May 1930.

Chatfield became First Sea Lord in January 1933 and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1934 New Year Honours. As First Sea Lord he won arguments that the Royal Navy should have 70 cruisers rather than the 50 cruisers that had been agreed at the London Naval Conference 1930, that the battleship still had an important role to play despite the development of the bomber and that the Fleet Air Arm should be part of the Royal Navy rather than the Royal Air Force. Chatfield played a key role in fashioning tactics that favoured night fighting and less centralised manoeuvres as the basis of tactics for future fleet battles. The American historians Williamson Murray and Alan Millet wrote that the Royal Navy in the interwar period did a superb job in training admirals and captains in the style of the 18th and early 19th centuries, so that &quot;...in the future there would be few of the egregious errors that marked the Battle of Jutland&quot;. Rear-Admiral (S) Sir Rowland Jerram who served under Chatfield for 20 years as his private secretary described him as: &quot;an officer of the old school in upbringing, but certainly not lacking in imagination and breath of view; of the highest ability as a seaman, a leader and in the higher ranks, a debater, sure of himself and 100% trusted by the Navy&quot;. The British historian Andrew Gordon described Chatfield as a man of the &quot;upmost integrity, humourless, very just, very aloof, very charming, very tactful, supremely efficient and an intellectual&quot; and &quot;quite possibly the best peacetime First Sea Lord the Admiralty ever had&quot;. Chatfield&#x27;s principle concern upon becoming First Sea Lord was ensuring that the British shipbuilding industry, which had been hard hit by the Great Depression, received enough orders for warships to keep the industry going.

When Chatfield became the First Sea Lord, the Admiralty was in a weak position with regards to the Treasury. The Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, was generally supportive of the Admiralty, but had been weakened by the split in the Labour Party in 1931 with McDonald leading a rump National Labour Party (which was the smallest of the parties that made up the governing coalition) in opposition to the Labour Party. The Foreign Secretary, Sir John Simon, was considered to be highly intelligent, but seemingly incapable of making a decision as Simon would lay out the options in foreign policy and then find himself unable to choose which option to pursue. The dominant personality in the cabinet was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, who was considered to be the most able minister in the National Government and already widely considered to be a future prime minister. With a weak foreign secretary and a prime minister leading a rump party in the coalition National government, the influence of the Treasury, which considered naval spending wasteful, was in the ascendency. The so-called &quot;ten year rule&quot; introduced in 1919 under which the service chiefs were to base their defence estimates on the assumption that there would be no major war in the next years had abandoned in early 1932 in response to Japan&#x27;s aggression in China, but it was still unclear just how far the cabinet would go with rearmament. In response to Chamberlain vetoing a request from the Admiralty requesting more stockpiling of fuel, more reservists for the Royal Navy, and more aeroplanes for the Fleet Air Arm, Chatfield together with the other three sea lords wrote to the cabinet on 16 January 1933 that they could only accept the Treasury viewpoint on naval spending &quot;if the cabinet is aware of and prepared to take responsibility for the continuance of these serious deficiencies&quot;. It was in part to resolve the dispute about what form British rearmament should go and in part how much to spend on rearmament that the Defence Requirements Committee was formed in November 1933. Chatfield found himself at odds with Chamberlain and the Treasury who favoured a return to the Anglo-Japanese alliance that had ended in 1922. The call from Chamberlain to a return to the Anglo-Japanese alliance prompted a strong reaction from the diplomats with Charles Orde, Robert Craigie, and Laurence Collier all writing that Japan was dead-set on an anti-Western course, and there was no hope of lasting understanding with Japan.

In debates with Sir Warren Fisher, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Treasury, who reached an understanding with Japan, Chatfield spoke in favour of reaching an understanding with the United States. Chatfield argued that the Imperial Japanese Navy was the powerful naval force in Asia; that Japan was becoming increasingly unfriendly towards Great Britain; that Hong Kong was dangerously exposed and the Singapore naval base was far from being completed despite having work having been started in 1919; and that for all these reasons that having the United States Navy as an ally in the Asia-Pacific region would be of immense strategical benefit. Chatfield&#x27;s arguments tended to win out over those of Fisher, who usually had nothing more than visceral anti-Americanism to base his arguments on. For his first two years as First Sea Lord, Chatfield was hamstrung by awaiting the result of the 1935 Naval Disarmament conference as he could not place any orders for warships until he knew what the results of the conference would be. As First Sea Lord, Chatfield had a marked tendency to play up the threat from Japan when addressing the Defence Requirements Committee in 1933–1934, which had the task of planning British rearmament for the next five years. The Defence Requirements Sub-Committee was chaired by Maurice Hankey and consisted of Chatfield plus the other two service chiefs, namely Air Chief Marshal Edward Ellington and Field Marshal Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd along with Sir Robert Vansittart of the Foreign Office and Sir Warren Fisher of the Treasury.

For Chatfield, a war with Japan offered up the prospect of fleet battles in Asian waters, which in turn would require more funding for the Royal Navy to build the necessary warships to confront the Japanese Navy along with building and maintaining the bases to properly supply the fleet if the Singapore strategy were activated. During the meetings of the Defence sub-committee, Chatfield stated the first concern should be Japan and he favoured having the Singapore base finished along with building defences to defend Singapore. Chatfield argued that the Singapore strategy was not only the best way to deter Japan, but also offered up the prospect of an alliance with the United States. He pointed out that the United States Navy was building a new naval base in Hawaii at Pearl Harbor, which took as a sign that the United States was also concerned about Japan, and argued that joint Anglo-American fears of Japanese expansionism could serve as the basis of an Anglo-American alliance. Besides for bases, Chatfield wanted to modernise the battle fleet; buy more cruisers and aircraft; equip all warships with ASDIC; and stockpile fuel and ammunition at the various Royal Navy bases. The estimates for the naval budget came in by a third of the original defence budget, which weakened his case. During the discussions of the DRC, Chatfield tended to an emphasis on the defence of the British Empire and the threat from Japan while Ellington called for a RAF equal to any European air force while Montgomery-Massingberd called for the British Army to have at least five divisions available to serve as an expeditionary force to France. Vansittart agreed with Chatfield that Japan was a danger, but argued that Japan would attack if Britain were involved in a war with another European power, which Vansittart stated could only be Germany. Chatfield&#x27;s efforts for a larger naval budget was undercut by a series of highly alarmist stories in the British newspapers about the power of strategical bombing to inflict a &quot;knock-out blow&quot; within a matter of days by razing entire cities, and along with the claim that the Luftwaffe possessed such a bomber force. The hysterical claims about the Luftwaffe, which vastly exaggerated the war-winning capacity of strategical bombing, which were shared by the Lord Privy Seal, Stanley Baldwin, ensured that the Royal Air Force received the lion&#x27;s share of the rearmament budget. The report of the Defence Requirements Commitment submitted to the cabinet in February 1934 called Germany &quot;the ultimate potential enemy&quot; against which British rearmament was to be directed against. However, in terms of recommendations the report in many ways favoured Chatfield such as in its call to finally finish the Singapore base and to strengthen British bases in Asia in general.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, protested that the costs of a naval arms race with Japan; sending another large expeditionary force to aid France; and building up a strong RAF would be too much of a financial strain and that choices had to be made. Chamberlain argued that since Germany was by far the most powerful of Britain&#x27;s potential enemies, the conclusion that Germany was &quot;the ultimate potential enemy&quot; should be strictly adhered to with regard to defence spending. As such, Chamberlain ruled that of the £76.8 million committed for defence spending in the coming fiscal year, £50.3 million was to go to the Royal Air Force. Chamberlain downplayed Chatfield&#x27;s thesis of a Japanese threat under the grounds that Japan could threaten Australia, New Zealand and the British colonies in Asia while Germany could threaten the United Kingdom itself. Chamberlain concluded in a paper to the cabinet: &quot;Our best defence would be the existence of a deterrent force so powerful as to render success in attack too doubtful to be worthwhile. I submit that this is most likely to be attained by the establishment of an air force based in this country of a size and efficiency calculated to inspire respect in the mind of a possible enemy&quot;. As part of an effort to sabotage Chatfield&#x27;s case, Chamberlain ruled that no new warships were to be ordered until the 1935 naval conference was held, and in the defence estimates submitted to the House of Commons in 1934, the Army&#x27;s budget was cut in half, the RAF&#x27;s budget was raised and the Royal Navy&#x27;s budget stayed about the same. The defence policy adopted in 1934 came to be known as &quot;limited liability&quot; with the thesis that Britain was an island that ruled a global empire and as such spending on air power and sea power was emphasised. Through Chatfield would preferred greater naval spending, he did not oppose the basic assumptions of the limited liability doctrine, and he tended to favour the defence of the British empire and the Commonwealth over the defence of other states that might be threatened with aggression.

The Treaty of Versailles had ended any potential German naval threat by banning the &quot;Reich&quot; from having submarines and warships over 10,000 tons. In 1929, the German fleet consisted of six old battleships, none of each were over 10, 000 tons; six light cruisers; 12 destroyers and 12 torpedo boats, which was a force that was far too small to pose any danger to British command of the sea. In December 1932, at the World Disarmament Conference in Geneva, the negotiators conceded Germany&#x27;s right &quot;in principle&quot; to have &quot;equality in status&quot; in regards to arms, meaning that Germany would have the weapons forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. Chatfield was in favour of accepting Adolf Hitler&#x27;s offer on 21 May 1935 of a German fleet that would be 35% of the tonnage of the Royal Navy under the grounds that Germany was going to violate the Treaty of Versailles anyway and acceptance of this offer would push German naval-building in the direction that would be least dangerous to the Royal Navy. Chatfield did not want the Germans to embrace upon a &quot;guerre de course&quot; strategy of having dozens of the &quot;Deutschland&quot;-class &quot;pocket battleships&quot; operating in tandem with groups of U-boats that would attack British shipping around the globe, and much preferred that the Germans build a battlefleet that mirrored British priorities as that would be the easier fleet for the Royal Navy to defeat. Owing to the lengthy period of time it took to construct warships, Royal Navy planners predicated that the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; would not be a threat in the 1930s and the earliest the German fleet could pose a danger would be sometime in the 1940s. Chatfield supported the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, which he argued secured British security by limiting the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to 35% of the Royal Navy. Chatfield noted in the Anglo-German Naval Agreement the 35% principle applied to tonnage categories of warships instead of the complete fleet, meaning that Germany would build battleships up to 35% of the tonnage of British battleships, 35% of the tonnage of British cruisers and so on.

In 1935, Italy made open preparations to invade Ethiopia, which was a member of the League of Nations. As Baldwin had made a point of running on a platform on emphasising support for the League of Nations and collective security in the general election of that year, it was expected that Britain would have to take some sort of action if Italy invaded. Chatfield reported that if the League of Nations imposed oil sanctions on Italy, it would cause an Italian economic collapse as Italy had no oil of its own, and would probably provoke Benito Mussolini into a desperate &quot;mad dog&quot; attack on Britain. However Chatfield reported it might be worth going to war with Italy because it offered a chance to &quot;reassert our dominance over an inferior race&quot;. During the Abyssinia crisis, Chatfield was regarded as the senior service chief whose advice Baldwin (who knew nothing of military affairs) generally followed The First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Bolton Eyres-Monsell, tended to follow Chatfield&#x27;s advice, being more of a representative of the Admiralty in the cabinet rather than its master. Chatfield was personally hostile towards the League of Nations, arguing that the principle of collective security could embroil Britain in wars where no British &quot;vital interests&quot; were at stake. Chatfield defined &quot;vital interests&quot; as the defence of the British Empire and the Commonwealth. Chatfield argued that for the Singapore strategy to work require use of the Mediterranean rather than sending the fleet the long way around Africa, and he preferred a friendly Italy to an unfriendly Italy, saying he no reason to antagonise Mussolini for a &quot;moral motive&quot;.

Chatfield reported to the cabinet that 76% of all imports to Italy came via the sea with 62% of all Italian imports coming from the Atlantic Ocean via the Strait of Gibraltar, 3% of Italian imports via the Suez canal, and the other 11% coming from other Mediterranean nations or the from nations bordering the Black Sea. Chatfield in a memo to the cabinet on 3 September 1935 wrote: &quot;With our forces based in Gibraltar and in Egypt, her main communications can be cut with comparatively little effort to ourselves, whereas to take any steps (excepting by submarine) to counter our action she would have to send her forces far from their bases where they would be brought to action. This strategical advantage is so great that it is highly unlikely that Italy could make any serious effort with naval forces to interfere with our control of the two exits to the Mediterranean except by action of her submarines, which could not prove to be decisive. Further, Italy&#x27;s objective is the prosecution of her Abyssinian war, and the mere closing of the [Suez] canal to her by the presence of our naval forces (whether the closing is done in the canal itself or by action outside of it) might be decisive within a measurable period&quot;. Chatfield admitted that if Britain did go to war with Italy, it might led to the &quot;Regina Marina&quot; temporarily taking control of the central Mediterranean, which in effect would be the same thing as severing the Suez canal, but he did not expect this advantage to last as he had low opinion of the Italian admirals, whom he noted were promoted on the basis of loyalty to the House of Savoy rather than merit, which was the case with the Royal Navy.

Despite his bluster, Chatfield advised caution as the Royal Navy had only 15 capital ships in 1935 (a fraction of the number available in the First World War), and even the loss of a few capital ships could be devastating as a single battleship cost millions of pounds to build and took several years to complete. In a memo to the Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, Chatfield wrote: &quot;we must never forgot that we have no naval margin at all, and the loss of one or two ships would be a serious matter for us&quot;. Chatfield stressed at present the battleships of the Royal Navy were in a process of being modernised by rotation. A number of warships were in the docks being equipped with radar, asdic and other aspects of modern technology. As such he had only 7 battleships available for operations at present. In a memo to Fisher on 25 August 1935, Chatfield wrote: &quot;...that a hostile Italy is a real menace to our Imperial communications and defence system. We have relied on practically abandoning the Mediterranean if we send our fleet east. For that reason, I do not want to go to extreme measures and hope the Geneva pacifists will fail to get unanimity and the League will break up&quot;. Chatfield stated that a war with Italy would likely lead to several British warships being sunk, which would take several years to replace, and would undermine the Singapore strategy. Through Chatfield expressed much confidence that the Royal Navy&#x27;s Mediterranean fleet was capable of defeating the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, in a memo to Vansittart, he wrote: &quot;I was surprised to find how unready the other two services were and how long it would take before they could give effective resistance to Italian action by land or air. The naval situation is bad enough...it would be a serious business if the great League of Nations, having at last agreed to act together, was able to be flouted by the nation it was trying to coerce&quot;. Chatfield advised against imposing oil sanctions on Italy, saying that a war with Italy was not worth the cost. Chatfield stressed that there was a danger that Japan might take advantage of an Anglo-Italian war, and predicated in the event of a war with Japan that Hong Kong would probably be lost as Hong Kong could not withstand a &quot;determined attack&quot; and that Singapore was &quot;dangerously weak&quot;.

In particular, Chatfield stated it was unclear if France would also join in a war against Italy, saying the support of France would be essential. Chatfield stated that the main British base in the Mediterranean in Malta was too exposed to Italian air and naval attacks, and could not be used. As for the other British bases in the Mediterranean, there were no docks for capital ships at Gibraltar and at the base in Alexandria the docks were only big enough for light cruisers and destroyers. For this reason, Chatfield stated it was imperative that the Royal Navy&#x27;s Mediterranean fleet have permission to use the docks for capital ships at the French Mediterranean fleet&#x27;s bases at Toulon and Bizerta, and as such it was crucial that Britain have the support of France in confronting Italy. The French Premier, Pierre Laval, was committed to achieving a Franco-Italian alliance, and through he pleaded support to the League of Nations, he did so in a manner that suggested grudging, half-hearted support. On 30 October 1935 in a meeting in London, Rear Admiral Jean Decoux of the French Naval General Staff promised Chatfield that France would also go to war if Britain went to war against Italy, though Decoux admitted that it would take several weeks before the &quot;Marine&quot; would be able to commerce operations against the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;. Decoux sheepishly admitted to Chatfield that the level of competence in the French Navy was so low that it would take at least three or four weeks after war was declared before the French Mediterranean fleet would be ready for operations. Chatfield was less interested in having the &quot;Marine&quot; join the proposed war than the offer that the British Mediterranean fleet could use the bases at Toulon and Bizerta for docking and repairs. The Chatfield-Decoux talks ended with the agreement that in the event of war, the French Mediterranean fleet would patrol the western Mediterranean while the British Mediterranean fleet would patrol the eastern Mediterranean. Ultimately, Baldwin and his cabinet chose not to go to war for the sake of Ethiopia as the cabinet wished to prevent a break-up of the Stresa Front and because no-one in the cabinet really cared about Ethiopia. One of the lasting effects of the Abyssinia crisis that Chatfield was able to have the cabinet approve of upgrading the facilities at Alexandria and Gibraltar.

In the middle of the Abyssinia crisis, on 7 March 1936, Germany violated the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Locarno by remilitarising the Rhineland. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the Rhineland had been declared a permanent demilitarised zone, an obligation Germany had voluntarily accepted under the terms of the Treaty of Locarno. In the latter treaty, Britain and Italy had &quot;guaranteed&quot; the current Franco-German and German-Belgian borders established by the Treaty of Versailles along with the demilitarised Rhineland. Chatfield advised the government not to go to war against Germany, arguing with the much of the British fleet stationed in the Mediterranean Sea for a potential war with Italy, it would be too dangerous to go to war against the &quot;Reich&quot;. He argued that though the German fleet was very &quot;small&quot; at present, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was a highly professional force and with so much of the British fleet in the Mediterranean, British trade routes were wide open to German attacks and he could not guarantee that coastal cites and towns along the North Sea coast would not be bombarded by German warships. He stressed that the two fast-moving German &quot;pocket battleships&quot;, the &quot;Deutschland&quot; and the &quot;Admiral Graf von Spee&quot; could only be hunted down by the equally fast moving battlecruisers HMS &quot;Hood&quot; and HMS &quot;Renown&quot; that had equally big guns, both of which were currently in the Mediterranean. Given the Abyssinia crisis, Chatfield did not want to return the &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Renown&quot; to home waters, and argued that the government had to choose between focusing on the Abyssinia crisis or the Rhineland crisis as he did not feel that Britain could take on Germany and Italy at the same time. Chatfield&#x27;s assessment of Britain&#x27;s options had much influence on decision-making, especially Anthony Eden who replaced Hoare as Foreign Secretary following the latter&#x27;s resignation in December 1935. 

Chatfield did not see U-boats as a serious threat, partly because of ASDIC and partly because the Germans built very few 700-ton ocean-going U-boats with the majority of the U-boats constructed being 500 ton sea-going or 200 ton coastal U-boats. Moreover, it was known that Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander-in-chief of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; favoured the traditional battleship-centric fleet designed to win a decisive battle of annihilation and did not care much for the &quot;guerre de course&quot; strategy. Reports from the British naval attaché in Berlin indicated that Admiral Karl Dönitz, the commander of the U-boat arm and the foremost advocate of a &quot;guerre de course&quot; strategy of using submarines to attack shipping, was an outsider in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; with most German admirals favouring a revival of the High Seas Fleet. All intelligence at the time indicated that the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was focused on building the cheaper and simpler 500 ton Type VII sea-going U-boats (which were the main U-boat type in World War Two) at the expense of the superior ocean-going Type IX U-boats. The decision to focus on building the inferior Type VII submarines instead of the Type IX was understood as a sign that Raeder was planning to use the U-boats as an ancillary to the main German battle fleet, instead of a war-winning weapon in and of itself. Raeder had in fact planned to defeat Great Britain via the gigantic fleet envisioned in the famous Z plan of January 1939, and had embraced a &quot;guerre de course&quot; strategy via the U-boats in September 1939 by default as the construction on the Z plan fleet had barely started. Raeder wrote glumly in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; war diary on 3 September 1939 that the war had come five years too early and that all of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; could do now was &quot;die gallantly&quot;.

The American historian Joseph Maiolo wrote that the U-boats were a menace in the first years of the Second World War primarily because of change in tactics with Dönitz championing the &quot;wolf pack&quot; tactic of having groups of U-boats attack convoys together rather than because of any technological advantage. Along with the change in tactics was the advantage that the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; gained upon taking control of the French Atlantic ports in June 1940, which gave the Germans direct access to the North Atlantic, most notably the Western Approaches, and it was only in the summer of 1940 that the U-boats started to sink significant number of ships. The limited range of the Type VII U-boats along with the need to travel from and to Germany via the North Sea imposed limitations on the ability of the U-boats to sink shipping in the North Atlantic, and prior to gaining the use of the French Atlantic ports, the U-boats were a &quot;nuisance&quot; rather than a threat. Chatfield predicated that the earliest that the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; could build up to the 35% tonnage ratio allowed by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement would be 1942, and for that if Hitler decided to go beyond the limits allowed by the AGNA, it would be sometime after 1942. Much like Raeder, Chatfield envisioned a repeat of the First World War where the Grand Fleet based in Scapa Flow faced off against the High Seas Fleet based in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel. Until the Z plan was launched, Hitler had consistently placed the Kriegsmarine third in defence spending behind the Army and the Luftwaffe, which was known to British intelligence, and led Chatfield to predicate it would be some time before Germany could construct a fleet that would be dangerous for British interests. Chatfield for a time favoured encouraging German expansionism into Eastern Europe as a way to encourage Hitler to spend more &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; on the Wehrmacht at the expense of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; as he believed a German conquest of Eastern Europe would impose &quot;liabilities&quot; on the &quot;Reich&quot;. Chatfield did not understand the military weaknesses of most of the Eastern European states, and that allowing Germany to conquer Eastern Europe would undercut a British blockade as all of the natural resources needed to sustain a modern industrial economy were to be found in Eastern Europe.

He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 3 May 1935. Having taken part in the funeral of King George V in January 1936 and the coronation of George VI in May 1937, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Chatfield of Ditchling in the County of Sussex on 11 June 1937. 

Baldwin had little interest in foreign policy, and during his last government left foreign policy to be managed by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden along with Chatfield, who largely determined British policy with regard to the Spanish Civil War. Chatfield had a marked pro-Nationalist bias, once writing that Spanish Nationalist cause was &quot;a much nobler cause than the Reds&quot;. On 5 August 1936, Admiral François Darlan arrived in London to see Chatfield to discuss the Spanish Civil War. Darlan expressed much concern about the Italian and German intervention in Spain on the Nationalist side and was especially worried about the prospect of Italy obtaining naval and air bases in the Balearic Islands. Likewise, Darlan was concerned about the prospect of German air and naval bases in the Canary Islands. Darlan suggested that Britain and France take action to stop Italy and Germany from obtaining any bases in either archipelago which might change the naval balance of power in the western Mediterranean and/or the eastern Atlantic. Chatfield was surprised that Darlan had come all the way from Paris to see him about the Spanish Civil War instead of having Charles Corbin, the French ambassador to the court of St. James, discuss the matter with him. The idea of sending Darlan to London had originated with a Labour MP Philip Noel-Baker who was a close friend of the French socialist leader Léon Blum who just become the premier of France. Noel-Baker had suggested to Blum that it would be best to send an admiral to London to win Chatfield over to opposing Axis intervention in Spain, which in turn might win Baldwin over as Chatfield had much influence with Baldwin on defence and foreign policies. Noel-Baker&#x27;s suggestion inspired Blum to dispatch Darlan on his mission. Darlan reported to Blum that Chatfield was blasé about the prospect of a Nationalist victory, saying that he disliked the Republican government and viewed General Francisco Franco as a &quot;Spanish patriot&quot; who would never grant bases to either Germany or Italy. The British historian Jill Edwards wrote that Chatfield&#x27;s sympathies with the Spanish Civil were &quot;more White than Red&quot;, but he did not hesitate to use the war in Spain as a &quot;stick with which to beat the Government with&quot;. Eden came to hold views very similar to the French position on Spain, arguing that the prospect of Italian and/or German bases in Spain was too dangerous for Britain, through he never expressed any affection for the Spanish republic. Eden and Chatfield constantly fought over the issue of Spain with Eden arguing that the Royal Navy should do more to end the Italian submarine attacks on ships going to Spain. 

On 12 December 1937, Chatfield&#x27;s vision of Anglo-American co-operation was brought much closer to fruition after the Japanese aircraft sank an American gunboat, USS &quot;Panay&quot; in the Yangtze river despite the &quot;Panay&quot; clearly flying an American flag and Japanese artillery damaged a British gunboat, HMS &quot;Ladybird&quot; when the &quot;Ladybird&quot; tried to pick up survivors from the &quot;Panay&quot;. In response to the unprovoked Japanese attacks on Anglo-American gunboats in the Yangtze, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had spoken vaguely to Sir Ronald Lindsay, the British Ambassador in Washington, about his wish for a joint Anglo-American blockade of Japan, saying that the Japanese were completely out of control and something would have to be done. In January 1938, Roosevelt dispatched Captain Royal E. Ingersoll of the United States Navy to London to hold secret talks with Chatfield about plans for a war with Japan. The talks were hampered by the fact that both Chamberlain who was now prime minister and Roosevelt had imposed the condition that the purpose of the talks was merely to gather information about the other side&#x27;s war plans, but Chatfield insisted that the United States and the United Kingdom should co-ordinate their policies in Asia as much as possible as he stated that the two English-speaking nations had common concerns.

Chatfield stated he resisted Chamberlain&#x27;s attempts to move in piecemeal Royal Navy ships to Singapore and wanted the Singapore strategy activated first before any steps were taken that might risk a war with Japan. Chatfield further told Ingersoll that there should be unity of command with Anglo-American forces in the Asia-Pacific region, but &quot;that as a principle he believed that since the two fleets would probably be separated at first and probably for some time, there could not be unity in command in a tactical or strategical and that strategical co-operation would be all that was possible&quot;. Chatfield suggested that there be close intelligence-sharing between the British and American navies along with a common means of communication such a joint cipher. Chatfield soon discovered during the talks that Ingersoll had no real power to negotiate anything, the purpose of his visit was more for information-gathering, and that Roosevelt had wanted the British to take the lead in confronting Japan as the president did not feel that Congress would grant him the necessary authority to go to war. Ingersoll noted that a blockade was an act of war under international law, and Roosevelt would need permission from Congress about imposing a blockade of Japan. Despite these caveats, Chatfield and Ingersoll agreed to a record of conversation that committed both sides to intelligence sharing, a joint cipher, a discussion of war plans, and permission to use each other&#x27;s waters in Asia-Pacific region (through Chatfield was unable to make any promises on behalf of Australia and New Zealand). The Chatfield-Ingersoll talks did not lead to any action against Japan in 1938 as Roosevelt chose to accept the Japanese claim that the sinking of the &quot;Panay&quot; was a &quot;mistake&quot;, but it marked the beginning of secret Anglo-American naval talks that help draw the United States out of isolationism. In April 1938, Chatfield did not oppose the Anglo-Irish treaty that turned over the Royal Navy&#x27;s bases in Ireland to the Eire government, which in turn affected the Royal Navy&#x27;s ability to defend the Western Approaches. He defended the decision to hand over the Irish treaty ports under the grounds that Germany would to have control of the French Atlantic ports to pose a serious threat to the Western Approaches, writing in his 1947 memoirs: &quot;With a French ally with an efficient navy, and a neutral, but friendly Norway, the Admiralty believed they could hold the position. Actually, their judgement in the envisioned circumstances proved right; the situation was held satisfactory until the fall of Norway and the collapse of France&quot;. He retired from the Royal Navy in August 1938.

In late 1938 Chatfield chaired the Expert Committee on the Defence of India which, using the work of the 1938 Auchinleck Committee, recommended that the arena of India&#x27;s defence should be re-focussed more on her sea communications and less on her North-Western Land Frontier as well as the modernisation of the British Indian Army, the re-equipment of the RAF squadrons and the re-stocking of war stores.

==Minister for Coordination of Defence==

Having been appointed to the Order of Merit in the 1939 New Year Honours, in February Chatfield succeeded Sir Thomas Inskip as Minister for Coordination of Defence in the government of Neville Chamberlain, despite having a non-political background. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time.

In the &quot;European Appreciation for the years 1939 and 1940&quot; issued by the chiefs of staff in February 1939, it was starkly warned that Britain could not win a war against an alliance of Germany, Italy and Japan, stating if war broke out against the Axis states, the Royal Navy would to sacrifice either the Mediterranean Sea or the South China Sea as there was no way to break up the fleet to deal with all three potential enemies at once. The possibility of the loss of naval dominance in the Mediterranean was understood as leading to the loss of the Middle East to Italy while the possibility of reneging on the Singapore Strategy and leaving Australia and New Zealand to face Japan by themselves was considered equally unappealing. The &quot;European Appreciation&quot; set off a bitter bureaucratic row between Chatfield who argued for sticking to the Singapore strategy as for him the loss of the British colonies in Asia along with Australia and New Zealand to the Japanese was unthinkable vs. the First Sea Lord, Roger Backhouse, who argued for a Mediterranean strategy. Backhouse along his principle adviser, Admiral Reginald Drax, won the debate against Chatfield with the decision by the cabinet that in the event of war that Royal Navy would focus on winning command of the sea in the Mediterranean first; only after the defeat of Italy would the Singapore strategy be activated and until Italy was defeated, Australia and New Zealand would to face Japan on their own. Adding to the bitterness of the debate was the sudden decision on the part of the Chamberlain cabinet to abandon its long-standing &quot;limited liability&quot; defence doctrine and make the &quot;continental commitment&quot;. Leslie Hore-Belisha, the War Secretary, argued very strongly that Britain would have to send a large expeditionary force to France in the event of a war, arguing that if France were defeated, the limited liability doctrine would be useless as Germany would be able to spend more &quot;reichmarks&quot; on the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine. The decision to expand the British Army to make the &quot;continental commitment&quot; led to a fierce debate about how many pounds to devote to the new, expanded Army. 
In March 1939 Chatfield urged an increase in munition production: &quot;Would it not be possible to put industry on a war production basis immediately, not necessarily at the expense of our export trade but by curtailing internal consumption?&quot; However the President of the Board of Trade, Oliver Stanley, objected: &quot;Such a step would be almost revolutionary, and must be proved absolutely essential before introduction&quot;. In March 1939 during the Danzig crisis, Chatfield supported the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, in his call for a declaration calling an alliance of the Soviet Union, France and Britain to defend Poland and Romania. However, Chamberlain expressed much doubt about the military effectiveness of the Red Army; noted that the Soviet Union had no frontier with Germany; and expressed &quot;the most profound distrust of Russia&quot; as he put on 26 March 1939. In addition, Chamberlain was always keen to keep British foreign policy coordinated with the Commonwealth, and the governments of Australia, Canada and South Africa all expressed strong opposition to an Anglo-Soviet alliance. As such, Chamberlain declared that eastern pivot of the &quot;peace front&quot; to deter Germany from war would be Poland rather than the Soviet Union. In cabinet debates Chatfield along with Halifax, Hore-Belisha, and the Home Secretary Samuel Hoare tended to favour broadening the &quot;peace front&quot; to include the Soviet Union as all had doubts about the ability of Poland to stand alone against Germany. Against them were ranged were Chamberlain and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, who kept citing evaluations by the British Army calling the Red Army &quot;of little use&quot;. During the Danzig crisis, Winston Churchill-a former First Lord of the Admiralty-wrote to Chatfield calling for a Royal Navy &quot;deterrent&quot; squadron to be sent into the Baltic Sea. The purpose of the &quot;deterrent&quot; squadron was to both threaten to cut the &quot;Reich&quot; off from supplies of high-grade Swedish iron (Germany had no high-grade iron of its own) and to distract the Wehrmacht by posing the threat of amphibious landings in northern Germany. Expecting the Soviet Union to join the &quot;peace front&quot;, Churchill suggested that the Baltic squadron use Kronstadt, the main base for the Soviet Baltic fleet, as its base. Chatfield wrote back on 29 March 1939, saying that Churchill&#x27;s plan was &quot;quite possible&quot; provided that neither Italy and/or Japan entered the war.

On 11 April 1939 the Foreign Policy Committee decided that the question of Russia&#x27;s potential as an ally should be referred to the Chiefs of Staff. Chatfield said that it was clear the political arguments against a Russian alliance outweighed any possible military benefits and that the Chiefs of Staff should only report on Russia&#x27;s military capability. On 24 April 1939 the Chiefs of Staff submitted their report and rated Russia&#x27;s military effectiveness low. The next day Chatfield gave the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy a summary of this report: &quot;Russia, although a great Power for other purposes, was only a Power of medium rank for military purposes...Her assistance would be of considerable, though not of great, military value&quot;. On 16 May 1939 Lord Halifax said that the political reasons for not allying with Russia were stronger than the strategic reasons for such an alliance. Chatfield responded: &quot;...if for fear of making an alliance with Russia we drove that country into the German camp we should have made a mistake of vital and far-reaching importance&quot;. By 1939, Chatfield did a &quot;volte-face&quot; on the importance of Eastern Europe, now arguing in contradiction to his previous views, that to allow the &quot;Reich&quot; to conquer Eastern Europe or otherwise bring it into the German sphere of influence, was too dangerous for British interests as it would make Germany immune to a British sea blockade.

In May 1939, Sir Roger Backhouse, the First Sea Lord, changed the Singapore strategy from sending all of the capital ships to Singapore to only sending 4 capital ships to Singapore in the event of trouble from Japan. Chatfield greatly disapproved of Backhouse&#x27;s alternations to the Singapore strategy and attempted unsuccessfully to have to change the strategy back to how he had drafted it. On the debates in the House of Commons on 18-19 May 1939, Chamberlain was hammered by Churchill on the issue of an alliance with the Soviet Union. Well briefed by Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador in London, Churchill argued that there was no realistic way of British troops reaching Poland in the event of war; that the purpose of the &quot;peace front&quot; was to deter Germany from invading Poland; and that Chamberlain&#x27;s offer that Britain would sign an alliance with the Soviet Union if Germany invaded Poland defeated the whole purpose of the &quot;peace front&quot;. In the cabinet, Chatfield made similar arguments that Churchill made in the House of Commons. In June 1939, General Petar Pešić of the Yugoslav General Staff visited London to meet Chamberlain, Halifax, and Chatfield to discuss what Yugoslavia would do if the Danzig crisis turned to war. Pešić argued that Yugoslavia&#x27;s sympathies were with the Allies, but Yugoslavia would declare neutrality in the event of war, which he argued would be of advantage to the Allies. Pešić assured Chatfield and the other British ministers that when the Allies had command of the sea in both the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, Yugoslavia would enter the war on the Allied side. Pešić admitted that Yugoslavia was too backward and poor to have any hope of victory against the &quot;Reich&quot;, but argued that neutrality could be of advantage to the Allies because if Yugoslavia was defeated, Germany would have access to all of Yugoslavia&#x27;s vast natural resources, but if Yugoslavia entered the war with Allied support, the said natural resources could be denied to Germany. During the Tientsin incident, Chatfield called very strongly for the Singapore strategy to be activated by sending 7 of the Royal Navy&#x27;s 11 capital ships available (the other 4 were being refitted) to Singapore. The Imperial Japanese Navy had 9 capital ships, but Chatfield stated that because of the &quot;Oriental inferiority&quot; in seamanship that 7 British capital ships would be sufficient to win a war against Japan. At the same time, tensions were escalating in the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk), and it was felt that Germany could attack Poland at any moment as almost everyday there were incidents between the Poles and the Germans in the Free City. At the key meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee of the Cabinet on 26 June 1939, Chatfield pressed for the Singapore strategy to resolve the Tientsin crisis if necessary by force, but Lord Halifax stated that Britain could only run the risk of war with Japan in the event of French and American support, neither of which was likely. The French Premier, Édouard Daladier, had stated that given the crisis in Danzig, there was no possibility of France risking a war with Japan while the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt made it clear that the United States would not risk a war with Japan for the sake of a British concession in China. As such, the committee chose not to activate the Singapore strategy in order to focus on the Danzig crisis, and chose to settle the Tientsin crisis via diplomacy, much to Chatfield&#x27;s disappointment. 

At about 10: 30 am on 1 September 1939, Count Edward Bernard Raczyński, the Polish ambassador to the Court of St. James, telephoned Halifax to tell him that Poland had been invaded earlier that morning, and as such he expected Britain to honor the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland by declaring war on the &quot;Reich&quot;. At an emergency cabinet meeting called at 11: 30, Chatfield stated he wanted the time limit on any British ultimatum to Germany to be as short as possible, and that an ultimatum should be sent &quot;without any more delay&quot;. At another cabinet meeting on 2 September 1939, Chatfield again spoke for sending an ultimatum to Berlin &quot;without delay&quot;, arguing the delay in declaring war on Germany was damaging British national honor. At an emergency session of the House of Lords on the same day, Chatfield in a speech called for an ultimatum to be sent no later than midnight. At a meeting on the evening of 2 September 1939 with Chamberlain at 10 Downing Street, Chatfield argued for an ultimatum to be delivered at 2: 00 am Berlin time with an expiry of 6: 00 am, saying there was no time to waste.

The plans for a British naval expedition into the Baltic were a fixture with Churchill who upon appointed First Lord of the Admiralty again on 3 September 1939 pressed for the operation to be launched under the codename Catherine. However, objections that the threat of Luftwaffe attacks on any British warships operating in the Baltic, the lack of any port as Kronstadt was unavailable following the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and the threat that the Germany would seize Denmark and with it the Danish Straits that link the Baltic Sea to the North Sea all solved to abort Operation Catherine. Churchill who served alongside Chatfield in the Chamberlain cabinet between September 1939-April 1940 was not impressed with him, and chose not to include him in his war cabinet.

Chatfield resigned as Minister for Coordination of Defence in April 1940 and subsequently chaired a committee on the evacuation of London&#x27;s hospitals. In June 1941, Chatfield submitted the first draft of his memoirs to the Cabinet Secretary, Edward Bridges. Bridges wanted to extensively censor the third part of Chatfield&#x27;s memoirs entitled &quot;The Naval and Political Story of Our Lack of Preparation for War&quot;. Bridges argued that Chatfield revealed far too much about decision-making in the MacDonald, Baldwin and Chamberlain governments and would &quot;give rise to controversy and weaken our war effort&quot;. Chatfield appealed to Churchill who partially sided with him. Churchill disliked Chatfield whom he described &quot;as a sailor who prolonged his official life after he left the Navy by building up credit with advocates of appeasement&quot;. However, Churchill ruled that Chatfield could not publish his memoirs as written in wartime, but after the war he could publish his memoirs uncensored as &quot;there are only a few things which should never be mentioned&quot;. Churchill seemed to be angling to establish a precedent to allow him to publish an uncensored war memoirs after the war. On 24 November 1941, Churchill told the cabinet that Chatfield would have to submit to Bridges&#x27;s censorship if he wanted to publish his memoirs in wartime, but after the war he would be free to publish an unexpunged version. Chatfield retired to his home at Farnham Common in Buckinghamshire and became Deputy Lieutenant of that county on 15 June 1951. He died at his home there on 15 November 1967.

==Family==
In July 1909 he married Lillian Emma Matthews (d.1977); they had two daughters and a son. Their son, Ernle, succeeded his father as Baron Chatfield. He followed him into the Royal Navy, serving as Aide-de-Camp to the Governor General of Canada between 1940 and 1945. The 2nd Baron settled in Victoria, British Columbia. Their elder daughter, Angela (Lady Donner) married Sir Patrick Donner MP. Their younger daughter, Katharine, married Henry Duckworth, son of Sir George Duckworth.

<text>In Canada and the United States, a railway post office, commonly abbreviated as RPO, was a railroad car that was normally operated in passenger service and used specifically for staff to sort mail en route, in order to speed delivery. The RPO was staffed by highly trained Railway Mail Service postal clerks, and was off-limits to the passengers on the train.

From the middle of the 19th century, many American railroads earned substantial revenues through contracts with the U.S. Post Office Department (USPOD) to carry mail aboard high-speed passenger trains. The Railway Mail Service enforced various standardized designs on RPOs. A number of railway companies maintained nominally unprofitable passenger routes, having found that their financial losses from moving people were more than offset by transporting the mail on such passenger routes.

==History==
The world&#x27;s first official carriage of mail by rail was by the United Kingdom&#x27;s General Post Office in November 1830, using adapted railway carriages on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Sorting of mail en-route first occurred in the United Kingdom with the introduction of the travelling post office in 1838 on the Grand Junction Railway, following the introduction of the Railways (Conveyance of Mails) Act 1838.

In the United States, some references suggest that the first shipment of mail carried on a train (sorted at the endpoints and carried in a bag on the train with other baggage) occurred in 1831 on the South Carolina Rail Road. Other sources state that the first official contract to regularly carry mail on a train was made with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in either 1834 or 1835. The United States Congress officially designated all railroads as official postal routes on July 7, 1838. Similar services were introduced on Canadian railroads in 1859.
The railway post office was introduced in the United States on July 28, 1862, using converted baggage cars on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad (which also delivered the first letter to the Pony Express). Purpose-built Railway Post Office (RPO) cars entered service on this line a few weeks after the service was initiated. They were used by staff to separate mail for connection with a westbound stagecoach departing soon after the train&#x27;s arrival at St. Joseph. This service lasted approximately one year. 

The first permanent Railway Post Office route was established on August 28, 1864, between Chicago, Illinois, and Clinton, Iowa. This service is distinguished from the 1862 operation because mail was sorted to and received from each post office along the route, as well as major post offices beyond the route&#x27;s end-points.

George B. Armstrong, assistant postmaster at Chicago, originally came up with the idea of having mail processed and distributed while the mail was on board, en route in mail cars. With the assistance of Schuyler Colfax, Speaker of the House at the time, and A. N. Zevely, Third Assistant Postmaster General, Armstrong was authorized to test his ideas.

In 1869, the Railway Mail Service (RMS), headed by George B. Armstrong, was officially inaugurated to handle the transportation and sorting of mail aboard trains. Armstrong was promoted from a supervisory position in the Chicago post office following his experiments in 1864 with a converted route agent&#x27;s car on runs between Chicago and Clinton, Iowa.

RPO car interiors, which at first consisted of solid wood furniture and fixtures, were soon redesigned to support their new purpose. In 1879, an RMS employee named Charles R. Harrison developed a new set of fixtures that soon gained widespread use. Harrison&#x27;s design consisted of hinged, cast-iron fixtures that could be unfolded and set up in a number of configurations to hold mail pouches, racks and a sorting table as needed for specific routes. The fixtures were also designed so they could be folded away completely to provide a wholly open space to carry general baggage and express shipments as needed by the railroads. Harrison followed through with manufacturing his design at a factory he opened in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin in 1881.

The July 1, 1862, Pacific Railroad Act signed by President Lincoln established government funding for the construction of a railroad from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean in order to open a main line mail route across the western frontier. The act was officially entitled &quot;AN ACT to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes&quot;. The Act authorized government-funded railroad mail routes across the American continent.

By the 1880s, railway post office routes were operating on the vast majority of passenger trains in the United States. A complex network of interconnected routes allowed mail to be transported and delivered in a remarkably short time. As many as a dozen clerks might work in a single RPO car, although fewer would be required if part of the car was used for transport of previously sorted mail or (often in a separate compartment) express and baggage. 

Railway mail clerks were subjected to stringent training and regular testing of details regarding their handling of the mail. On a given RPO route, each clerk was expected to know not only the post offices and rail junctions along the route, but also specific local delivery details within each of the larger cities served by the route. Periodic testing demanded both accuracy and speed in sorting mail, and a clerk scoring &quot;only&quot; 96% accuracy would likely receive a warning from the Railway Mail Service division superintendent. Interurban and Streetcar systems were also known to operate RPOs. The Boston Elevated Railway car was noted for making circuits of the city to pick up mail.

In the United States, RPO cars (also known as mail cars or postal cars) were equipped and staffed to handle most back-end postal processing functions. First class mail, magazines and newspapers were all sorted, cancelled when necessary, and dispatched to post offices in towns along the route. Registered mail was also handled. The foreman in charge was required to carry a regulation pistol while on duty to discourage theft of the mail.

==Standardization==
 Because of the physical and mental demands placed on RPO clerks, the Railway Mail Service pushed the adoption of standardized floor plans and fixtures for all RPO cars, with the first plans published in 1885. The RMS also pressed for improved lighting fixtures to help the clerks see the addresses on the mail they sorted, first by improving the reflectors in the 1880s, then calling for discontinuance of oil lamps in the 1890s and the first experiments with electric lighting in 1912. Clerks&#x27; safety was also of great concern to the RMS, with the first comprehensive statistics on work-related injuries published in 1877.

Through the second half of the 19th century, most RPO cars were painted in a somewhat uniform color scheme regardless of the railroad that owned or operated them. Most were painted white with trim in either buff, red or blue, which made the cars stand out from the other cars. By the 1890s, this practice had waned as railroads painted their RPO cars to match the rest of their passenger equipment. One RPO car that was displayed at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago is one of the last known examples of the early white color scheme.

As the development of passenger cars progressed, so too did the development of RPO cars. The first plans for RPO car designs were based on light baggage car frames and bodies, which sometimes resulted in catastrophe for RMS employees when the trains were involved in accidents. From 1900 to 1906 some 70 workers were killed in train wrecks while on duty in the RPOs, leading to demands for stronger steel cars. The RMS developed its first standards for car design in 1891 to address some of these issues. 

In 1912, the Railway Mail Service developed a set of strength requirements for new cars in an effort to push the car building companies into using steel for the cars&#x27; major structural components and underframes. The core of the requirements was that each car should be able to withstand a buffer force of at least 400,000 pounds. This requirement was doubled to 800,000 pounds in a 1938 revision of the standards. The requirements were again strengthened in 1945 with specifications that precluded the use of aluminium for framing and major structural components. The 1945 revisions also included a requirement for end posts to prevent telescoping in the event of a collision. Railway car manufacturers adopted these requirements and carried them through to all other models of passenger cars that they built. 

The 800,000-lb buffer load and end post requirements were later adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for all passenger MU locomotives as of April 1, 1956. They were extended to all passenger cars and locomotives in 1999 by the USDOT.

An interesting feature of most RPO cars was a hook that could be used to snatch a leather or canvas pouch of outgoing mail hanging on a track-side mail crane at smaller towns where the train did not stop. The first US patent for such a device () was awarded to L. F. Ward of Elyria, Ohio, on January 29, 1867. This was about a year after apparatus for picking up and setting down mailbags without stopping was installed for equivalent UK TPOs at Slough and Maidenhead, having first been patented in UK in 1838 by Nathaniel Worsdell. 

With the train often operating at 70 mph or more, a postal clerk would have a pouch of mail ready to be dispatched as the train passed the station. In a co-ordinated movement, the catcher arm was swung out to catch the hanging mail pouch while the clerk stood in the open doorway. The mail pouch had a strap around the middle, and the strap was tightened in preparation for pickup with an approximately equivalent weight of mail in either end of the pouch to prevent the heavier end from pulling the lighter end off the catcher arm. As the inbound pouch slammed into the catcher arm, the clerk kicked the outbound mail pouch out of the car, making certain to kick it far enough that it was not sucked back under the train. Outbound pouches of first class mail were sealed with a locked strap for security. Larger sacks with optional provisions for locking were used for newspapers, magazines, and parcel post. An employee of the local post office would retrieve the pouches and sacks and deliver them to the post office.

In the 1950s the Budd Company offered two versions of its self-propelled diesel RDC with RPO: the RDC-3 combine and the RDC-4 (a baggage/mail/express only unit). These models were purchased by the New York Central, Boston &amp; Maine, New Haven Railroad, Rock Island, Pacific Great Eastern, Northern Pacific, Canadian Pacific Railway, Canadian National and Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis.

==Cancellation stamps==

Most RPO cars had a mail slot on the side of the car, so that mail could actually be deposited in the car, much like using the corner mail box, while the train was stopped at a station. Those desiring the fastest delivery would bring their letters to the train station for dispatch on the RPO, knowing that overnight delivery would be virtually assured. The mail handled in this manner received a cancellation just as if it had been mailed at a local post office, with the cancel giving the train number, endpoint cities of the RPO route, the date, and RMS Railway Mail Service or PTS Postal Transportation Service between the killer bars. Collecting such cancellations is a pastime of many philatelists and postal history researchers.

The Railway Mail Service organization within the Post Office Department existed between 1864 and September 30, 1948. It was renamed the Postal Transportation Service on October 1, 1948, and existed until 1960. After 1960, the management of railway post office routes as well as Highway Post Office routes, Air Mail Facility, terminal railway post offices, and transfer offices, were shifted to the Bureau of Transportation.

==Decline and withdrawal==
At their height, RPO cars were used on over 9,000 train routes covering more than 200,000 route miles in North America. While the majority of this service consisted of one or more cars at the head end of passenger trains, many railways operated solid mail trains between major cities; these solid mail trains would often carry 300 tons of mail daily.

After 1948, the railway post office network began its decline although it remained the principal intercity mail transportation and distribution function within the Post Office Department (POD). There were 794 RPO lines operating over 161,000 miles of railroad in that year. Only 262 RPO routes were still operating by January 1, 1962. In 1942, the POD began experimenting with a highway version of the RPO to serve the same purposes along routes where passenger train service was not available. These highway post office (HPO) vehicles were initially intended to supplement RPO service, but in the 1950s and 1960s, HPOs often replaced railway post office cars after passenger train service was discontinued. The last interurban RPO service was operated by Pacific Electric Railway on its route between Los Angeles and San Bernardino, California.

When the post office made a controversial policy change to process mail in large regional &quot;sectional centers,&quot; mail was now sorted by large machines, not by people, and the remaining railway post office routes, along with all highway post office routes, were phased out of service. In September 1967 the POD cancelled all &quot;mail by rail&quot; contracts, electing to move all first class mail via air and other classes by road (truck) transport. This announcement had a devastating effect on passenger train revenues; the Santa Fe, for example, lost $35 million (US) in annual business, and led directly to the ending of many passenger rail routes.

After 113 years of railway post office operation, the last surviving railway post office running on rails between New York and Washington, D.C. was discontinued on June 30, 1977. The last route with a railway post office title was actually a boat run that lasted a year longer. This boat railway post office was the Lake Winnipesaukee RPO operating between The Weirs, New Hampshire, and Bear Island on Lake Winnipesaukee. The final date it operated with a postmark was September 30, 1978.

== Preservation ==
Many RPO cars have been preserved in railroad museums across North America; some of the cars are kept in operational condition. In 1933, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad rebuilt one of its baggage cars into a replica of the first RPOs that were used on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad in 1862. The railroad displayed the car in several cities along the railroad; it now resides at the Patee House Museum in St. Joseph, Missouri.

The Minnesota Transportation Museum (MTM) maintains Northern Pacific #1102, a 1914 Mail RPO, that is classed as a &quot;combine&quot; car, having sections for the RPO, Railway Express Agency and twenty seats for paying passengers. Currently, it is the only Railway Post Office car known to be operational and currently certified for operation on commercial rail. The Osceola and St Croix Valley Railway (division of MTM/reporting mark MNTX) operates the car as part of its tour line, actually &quot;catching the mail on the fly&quot; as a part of its regular runs.

As part of the 40th anniversary of the end of RPO service, Minnesota Transportation Museum will be placing #1102 on display at Saint Paul Union Depot as part of its &quot;Last Mail Train&quot; for National Train Day, 6 May 2017. At the end of the day, Great Northern 400, Northern Pacific Railway RPO #1102 and two coaches will be departing Union Depot as Train #1 bound for Osceola, Wisconsin. It will be hauling commemorative envelopes and cards to be sent all across the United States, following which it will operate in regular service as part of the Museum operations out of Osceola, WI.

Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, PA has RPO car #1100, Louisville &amp; Nashville, on display. It is an all-steel car built in 1914 by the American Car and Foundry Company. The Oil Creek and Titusville Railroad operates a post office car and all mail posted there gets an official USPS OC&amp;T postmark.

<text>The Bodrog is a river in eastern Slovakia and north-eastern Hungary. It is a tributary of the river Tisza. The Bodrog is formed by the confluence of the rivers Ondava and Latorica near Zemplín in eastern Slovakia. It crosses the Slovak–Hungarian border at the village of Felsőberecki (near Sátoraljaújhely) in Hungary, and Streda nad Bodrogom in Slovakia, where it is also the lowest point in Slovakia (94.3 m AMSL), and continues its flow through the Hungarian county Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, until it meets the river Tisza, in Tokaj. A town along its course is Sárospatak, in Hungary.

Its length is 67 km (15 in Slovakia, 52 in Hungary). Its watershed area is 13,579 km2 of which 972 km2 is in Hungary. The river is rich in fish.

<text>Top Gear is a racing game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, published by Kemco and developed by Gremlin Graphics in 1992. The objective of the game is to become the fastest driver in the world by racing other drivers across several nations.

It marks the first game in the &quot;Top Gear&quot; racing game franchise, and it is one of the first racing games to be released on the Super NES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System). This game and its next two sequels were created by the same developers as the similar &quot;Lotus&quot; series of games was released earlier on the Amiga and Mega Drive.

== Gameplay ==
When players first start the game, they are given several options to choose from, including entering their name, a choice of four different controller layouts, a choice between automatic or manual transmission, and their choice of four unique cars. During the race, the player will have to steer and shift gears (if they chose a manual transmission). The player is also given control over three &quot;nitros&quot;, which allow the player to increase their speed for a short period of time. The game features a password save system, made up of automotive terms such as &quot;gear box&quot; and &quot;oilcloth&quot;. Each password grants access to another country to race in. During the race, there are pits in which players must stop in order to refuel. If their car runs out of fuel and coasts to a stop before the race is finished, the player will be disqualified.

== Development and release ==

The music in &quot;Top Gear&quot; mostly consists of remixed tracks from the &quot;Lotus series&quot; of racing games on the Amiga produced by Barry Leitch. For example, the title music of &quot;Top Gear&quot; is taken from the ending of &quot;Lotus Turbo Challenge 2&quot;, and the third race of each country uses a remixed version of the &quot;Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge&quot; title theme.

The game (under the title &quot;Top Racer&quot;), along with several other retro titles, was released by Piko Interactive on a multi-cart for the Evercade handheld gaming system in 2020.

Developer QUByte Interactive released the game for modern systems under the name &quot;Top Racer Collection&quot; on March 7, 2024.

== Reception ==
&quot;Top Gear&quot; was met with positive reception from critics and reviewers alike since its release.

== Legacy ==

The game became very popular in Latin America, especially in Brazil. It inspired Brazilian company Aquiris Game Studio to create the arcade racing game &quot;Horizon Chase - World Tour&quot;, which features an original soundtrack scored by &quot;Top Gear&quot; composer Barry Leitch, who also contributes an unlockable remix of the &quot;Top Gear&quot; main title theme.

<doc id="1107879" wikidata="Q1326844" url="?curid=1107879" title="Zhu Youlang">
<text>The Yongli Emperor (1623–1662; reigned 24 December 1646 – 1 June 1662), personal name Zhu Youlang, was the fourth and last emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty, reigning in turbulent times when the former Ming dynasty was overthrown and the Manchu-led Qing dynasty progressively conquered the entire China proper. He led the remnants of the Ming loyalists with the assistance of peasant armies to resist the Qing forces in southwestern China, but he was then forced to exile to Toungoo Burma and eventually captured and executed by Wu Sangui in 1662. His era title &quot;Yongli&quot; means &quot;perpetual calendar&quot;.

Zhu Youlang was the son of Zhu Changying (朱常瀛), the seventh son of the Wanli Emperor, and Empress Dowager Ma. He inherited the title Prince of Gui (桂王) from his brother and lived an obscure life as a minor member of the Ming imperial family until the rebellions of peasant armies, which resulted to the fall of the imperial capital, Beijing, and the suicide of the last Ming emperor, Chongzhen, after the peasant rebel leader Li Zicheng captured Beijing in 1644. The true beneficiaries of the collapse of the Ming were the Qing dynasty, ruled by the emerging nation Manchus from Manchuria. After mass defection from Ming remnants, including a former Ming general, Wu Sangui, who allowed the Qing forces to pass the Ming Great Wall against Li Zicheng. The Qing forces defeated the peasant armies and rapidly expanded to northern China, the Lower Yangtze valley, and Central China. The Ming loyalists continued to resist in southern China, with several former Ming royal members regrouping in the south in attempt to re-establish the Ming governance, but all failed before the rapid Manchu military advance. Youlang ascended the throne in Zhaoqing as the fourth Southern Ming emperor in November 1646. 

By 1661, pressed back into Yunnan province, he fled to Burma. A Qing Han Banner army led by Wu Sangui pursued and captured him from the king of Burma, and he was executed in June 1662.

==History==

===Historical background===
In April 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor, committed suicide at Coal Hill as a rebel army entered Beijing. Six weeks later, on 5 June, the army of the Manchus, a people from beyond the Great Wall, entered the city and proclaimed the end of the Ming and the beginning of the Qing. In the following two years, as the Qing extended their control over northern China, the remaining Ming loyalists attempted to regroup in the south, but in rapid succession the Hongguang, Longwu, and Shaowu emperors were captured and executed.

===Campaigns in southern China===
Zhu Youlang became &quot;Caretaker of the State&quot; on 20 November 1646, following the death of the Longwu emperor. When Longwu&#x27;s brother then declared himself emperor with the reign-title Shaowu, Youlang himself ascended the throne (24 December 1646) as Yongli emperor. A brief civil war between the two emperors ended a month later when the Qing captured and executed Shaowu.

Zhu Youlang succeeded to the throne with approval by his fathers widow and principal wife Empress Dowager Wang, who was his own adoptive mother, and during his first five years of reign, she acted as his adviser, and it was said that she was &quot;...versed in letters, aware of current events, analytical about tasks and clear in her reasoning. After the Emperor assumed the throne there was nothing in which he did not follow her wishes.&quot;

The continuing military pressure of the Qing forced Youlang to withdraw further into the south and west, first to Guilin in Guangxi, then to Jiangxi and Hunan, then south again to Nanning in Guangxi. He had a number of experienced and devoted followers, but became increasingly reliant on the military support of local warlords and bandit chieftains. The best and most effective of these was Li Dingguo, who for five years was highly successful in enlarging Southern Ming territories in the southwest. This success, however, caused the Qing to place the entire region in the hands of the extremely capable former Ming official Hong Chengchou, who was named governor-general of five provinces. By 1658 Youlang had been forced back into Yunnan, on the very edge of China&#x27;s southwestern frontier.

===Flight and exile in Burma===

In 1658 Zhu Youlang retreated to Kunming in Yunnan, from where he sought refuge under the protection of Pindale Min (1608–1661), ninth king of the Taungoo dynasty of Burma. Pindale gave him permission to live at Sagaing, near the Burmese capital of Ava (both near the modern Burmese city of Mandalay), provided his men surrendered their weapons. He finally fled into Burma in 1661.

It soon became apparent to the Burmese that Zhu Youlang intended to carve himself a kingdom in Burma, and war broke out between the exiled prince and his hosts. The Chinese devastated the land around Ava but failed to capture it, thanks to the defence offered by Pindale&#x27;s mercenary Portuguese artillery (led by a mysterious Mi-thari Kattan, which might be a Burmese attempt at an otherwise unknown &quot;Mister Cotton&quot;). Pindale&#x27;s attempt to profiteer from the resulting famine led to his overthrow by his brother and chief general, Pye Min (meaning &quot;Prince Pye&quot;), in May 1661. Pye broke the siege and demanded that all the Chinese, with the exception of Youlang himself, swear allegiance to the king of Ava, after which they would be dispersed through the kingdom. The ceremony at which this was to be carried out turned into a disaster, with the Chinese, fearing that the plan was to murder them all, turning on the Burmese. Pye now ordered all the Chinese, again with the exception of Youlang, to be put to death.

At this point, in December 1661, a Qing army of 20,000 under Wu Sangui entered Burma and demanded the surrender of Youlang. Pye summoned his advisors, who pointed out that both the Burmese and the Chinese had previously delivered up persons to each other. In addition, Wu Sangui&#x27;s army was large, and the Burmese had already suffered enough from the presence of their guest. Accordingly, on 22 January 1662, the last monarch of the Southern Ming, together with his sons and grandsons, were put on boats and forwarded to Wu Sangui&#x27;s camp near Ava. Thinking that he was being taken to his longtime military protector Li Dingguo, the forlorn emperor only realized his real destination when he arrived at Wu&#x27;s camp.

==Death==
Zhu Youlang, Prince of Gui and last serious claimant to the Ming throne, was delivered into the custody of Wu Sangui, a Chinese general who had once served the Ming, and Manchu prince, general, and high minister of state, Aixinga. He was transported to Yunnanfu, the capital of Yunnan, where in June he was personally strangled by Wu Sangui. Wu had played a major role in the overthrow of the dynasty, having opened the gates in the Great Wall to the Qing and later leading the Qing campaign against the Southern Ming. It is said that Youlang scorned Wu in his last moments, saying that he betrayed his people and country, and urged Wu to kill him faster because he was disgusted to see &quot;a traitor&#x27;s face.&quot;

The last Ming dynasty princes who held out against the Qing after Zhu Youlang were Zhu Shugui, Prince of Ningjing and Zhu Hónghuán, Prince of Lu who accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan. Zhu Shugui acted as his representative in the Kingdom of Tungning and performed rites in his name until 1683.

<text>Patricia Beer (4 November 1919 – 15 August 1999) was an English poet and critic. Born to a family of Plymouth Brethren, a strict religious order, she took inspiration for her poetry from there, with particular influence from her mother who instilled the religion into her from a young age. Exposure to death during childhood also influenced her work. She earned a Bachelor of Letters degree at the University of Oxford, after which she taught in Italy for seven years. Returning to England, she began to publish poetry in 1959, and wrote full-time since 1968. Near her death, she was a candidate to replace Ted Hughes as Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Beer died in Upottery in Devon on 15 August 1999.

Beer&#x27;s poetry style began as neo-romanticism, but she departed from it as her career progressed. &quot;The Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; cites the background and legends of West Country as an influence in her poetry. Harry Blamires compared her work to W. B. Yeats for the way it &quot;sucks the reader into the heart of compulsive inner argument and self-scrutiny&quot;, while Michael Schmidt, founder of &quot;P. N. Review&quot;, compared her to Stanley Spencer in her lucidity and canny innocence. Her 1974 &quot;Reader, I Married Him&quot;, in which she found Jane Austen&#x27;s women characters to be wanting due to their chasing marriage, represented feminism&#x27;s early impact on academic criticism.

==Biography==
Patricia Beer was born on 4 November 1919 in Exmouth, Devon, into a family of Plymouth Brethren, a strict religious sect. Hymns were the first poetry Beer wrote. Her mother worked as a schoolteacher, while her father worked as a railway clerk. Her parents raised her in Withycombe Raleigh, a village near Exmouth. Beer was strongly influenced by the Plymouth Brethren Church, especially its &quot;inward-looking Christianity&quot; and her mother&#x27;s instilling to her the religion. Death also influenced her work, with two of her grandparents working with coffins and tombstones; as an eight year old, Beer stated she had an abnormal fear of death, and saw poetry and the fame it could bring as a means to cope with eternity. She wanted to be a poet from that age.

Various sources describe her mother as dominant or the dominant parent. Beer wrote of her childhood in &quot;Mrs Beer&#x27;s House&quot;, a memoir published in 1968. Her mother wanted her to be a schoolteacher. Patricia went to Exmouth Grammar School after earning a scholarship, where she continued after her mother&#x27;s death in 1935. She studied English at Exeter University. Beer moved away from her religious background as a young adult, becoming a teacher and academic. She took her Bachelor of Letters degree at the University of Oxford, following which she spent seven years in Italy from 1946 until 1953, where she taught English literature at the University of Padua, the British Institute and the in Rome. On this time in her life, Beer stated she was &quot;enjoying [herself] in a way [she] wasn&#x27;t allowed to when [she] was a child&quot;.

She started her career as a writer in the 1950s. Beer returned to England in 1953 where she became Senior Lecturer in English at Goldsmiths&#x27; College at the University of London (1962–1968). She wrote &quot;Reader, I Married Him&quot;, which published in 1974, on Victorian women writers, a work from her time at Goldsmiths. From 1968 onwards, she wrote full-time. She edited several anthologies, broadcast, and contributed to literary reviews, including for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

Beer was married twice; first in 1960 to the writer P. N. Furbank, and then in 1964 to John Damien Parsons, an architect, settling in Upottery, near Honiton. Near her death, she was a candidate to replace Ted Hughes as Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Beer died on 15 August 1999 in Upottery of a stroke. A compilation of her lengthier reviews under the title &quot;As I was Saying&quot; was published after her death in 2002.

==Style, analysis and themes==
When she began to write in the 1950s, her style fell into neo-romanticism of Britain post-World War II, though her style departed from neo-romanticism as she developed. Contemporary critics influenced Beer, with her stating she could not do her best poetry while thinking about them. As she progressed, her writing shifted from the use of personae and similes to incorporating metaphor. Beer integrated literary figures native to England into works frequently. Gerard Manley Hopkins is cited as an influence for Beer to depart from strict metre later in her career. According to &quot;The Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; (2009), the folklore and background of the West Country created the basis for many of Beer&#x27;s poems. Similarly, the bucolic and rural nature of her home in Upottery is thought to have influenced her work.

Death is a theme throughout her poetry, especially in &quot;Autumn&quot; (1997), her last book of poetry. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it &quot;more droll than sad&quot; and called her style overall wry melancholy. A writer for the Poetry Archive cited themes of good versus evil and religious beliefs, and said Beer imparts to them a sense of wryness. &quot;The Independent&quot; said she had a dark humor. On writing poetry, Beer stated there should be a connection between a poet&#x27;s speaking voice and their writing voice, particularly important when the poet has a regional accent. In her book, &quot;Reader&quot;, she found Jane Austen&#x27;s women characters to be wanting due to their chasing marriage. This represented feminism&#x27;s early impact on academic criticism.

Harry Blamires compared her work to W. B. Yeats for the way it &quot;sucks the reader into the heart of compulsive inner argument and self-scrutiny&quot;, while Michael Schmidt, founder of &quot;P. N. Review&quot;, compared her to Stanley Spencer in her lucidity and canny innocence. Schmidt said Beer separates herself from Victorian writers through irony, and says she takes religion without belief, but seriously nonetheless. He cites her prosaic poems as her real problem. Göran Nieragden states that Beer&#x27;s &quot;I&quot; stages an ego and forms an identity that is non-permanent and context bound and that &quot;&#x27;[f]uzzy&#x27; boundaries often mark the interface of the me and the you, of self and other&quot;. On the latter, Nieragden cites an example where Beer&#x27;s female victim of an assassin becomes a love target for the assassin himself.

<text>The Albatros C.III was a twin-seat general-purpose biplane designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Albatros Flugzeugwerke. It was produced in greater numbers than any other C-type aircraft by Albatros as well as being the company&#x27;s most-produced twin-seat aircraft.

The C.III was developed during 1915 as a refined and slightly smaller derivative of the successful Albatros C.I. The two aircraft shared similar construction and numerous features, the most distinct visual difference being its redesigned empennage, being both more rounded and lower than that of the C.I. As a result, the C.III was more responsive and agile, both being beneficial traits in aerial combat. Typically, both the observer and pilot were provisioned with machine guns, although the gun synchronizer for the pilot&#x27;s forward-firing guns often malfunctioned and resulted in propeller damage. Up to 90 kg (200 lb) of bombs could also be carried, although the lack of a bombsight greatly hindered their effective use on the battlefield. For coordination with ground forces, a radio set could optionally be installed.

The &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; first deployed the C.III on the Western Front during December 1915; it quickly deployed the type in a variety of roles beyond aerial reconnaissance, including as a light bomber and a bomber escort. The aircraft was produced by numerous manufacturers, enabling it to become available in quantity rather quickly. By mid-1917, the C.III was mainly being used a trainer aircraft, a task which it was well-suited to on account of its favourable flying characteristics, natural stability, and availability. It remained in &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; service through to the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Various other nations acquired their own C.IIIs, leading to its use by the Polish Air Force, Bulgarian Air Force, and Ottoman Air Force amongst others. Small batches were also produced during the 1920s.

==Design==
The C.III has its origins in the Albatros C.I, being directly derived from it and being a slightly more compact aircraft. The most prominent visual difference between the two aircraft was the revised vertical stabilizer; the C.III possessed a lower and rounded tail in place of the large triangular tail of the C.I, which, in combination with its reduced weight, provided greater agility to the newer aircraft. Specifically, the revised empennage of the C.III gave more sensitive and immediate longitudinal control in comparison to the docile C.I, an aspect that proved valuable when performing evasive combat maneuvers. The rudder was noticeably more rounded than that of the C.I.

The fuselage of the C.III was, akin to the C.I and B.II, was primarily composed of plywood. This construction proved to be fairly capable of absorbing damage, which made it somewhat difficult to shoot down in combat. The wings were covered with fabric and had a wooden structure, aside from the steel tubing used for the flight control surfaces. The C.III could be outfitted with various power plants, such as the 110 kW (150 hp) Benz Bz. III or 120 kW (160 hp) Mercedes D.III inline engine and, like numerous other twin-seaters used during the conflict (such as the British Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8) the cylinder head and exhaust manifold protruded above the front fuselage, somewhat limiting the pilot&#x27;s forward visibility.
The observer, who occupied the rear cockpit, was armed with a single 7.92 mm (0.312 in) Parabellum MG14 machine gun. After it was recognised that the addition of more weaponry would not unduly impact performance, the C.III was routinely fitted with a single forward-firing 7.92 mm (0.312 in) LMG 08/15 machine gun. The forward-firing machine gun was fitted with a gun synchronizer, however, this device often proved to be less effective than desired as multiple instances of pilots accidentally destroying their own propeller were recorded. For the artillery spotting role, the C.III could be equipped with a radio set. The C.III could also carry a bomb load of up to 90 kg (200 lb) across four vertical tubes in the fuselage or upon external racks. The aiming of these bombs was not easy due to the lack of an accurate sighting device, limiting the aircraft&#x27;s use as a bomber to barely more than harassment.

German authorities enthusiastically received the C.III; cumulative orders for 2,271 aircraft were placed for the type. In order to fulfil this vast demand, arrangements to produce the type were granted to numerous aircraft manufacturers across the Central Powers, including Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft, Linke-Hoffman Werke, Deutsche Flugzeug-Werke, and Albatros&#x27; Austro-Hungarian subsidiary &quot;Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke&quot; (OAW).

==Operational history==

The first of the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;s C.IIIs arrived at the Western Front during December 1915. It was promptly used in a wide variety of roles, including observation, aerial reconnaissance, light bombing and bomber escort. Despite these varied mission types, the C.III was most commonly used to perform reconnaissance. The operational peak for the type was reached during August 1916, at which point 354 aircraft were believed to be operational at the front.

By mid-1917, the C.III had mostly been withdrawn from frontline service with the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;, although deliveries of the type were still underway by this point; the aircraft having been relegated to secondary duties, mostly to training units. As such, it remained in service until the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the conflict.

During August 1916, at least eighteen C.IIIs were delivered to Bulgaria. These were all destroyed in 1920 in accordance with the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine. According to other sources, 26 Albatros C.III were delivered to Bulgaria, including eight trainers.

In the aftermath of the First World War, the Polish Air Force operated around 15 C.III for a time. These saw active combat during the Polish-Soviet War.

Between 1926 and 1927, two Mercedes D.III engined copies were built from saved parts and components of the destroyed aircraft by Bulgarian state aircraft workshops DAR as the &quot;DAR 2&quot; for use as trainers. According to the military historian Dimitar Nedialkov, twelve DAR 2s were built (at least nine are confirmed by a photograph). Three C.IIIs were built in 1927-1928 at Lithuanian Karo Aviacijos dirbtuvės (Military Aviation Workshop) in Kaunas.

==Variants==

<text>Félix Leclerc (August 2, 1914 – August 8, 1988) was a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, writer, actor and political activist. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 20, 1968. Leclerc was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame for his songs &quot;Moi, mes souliers&quot;, &quot;Le P&#x27;tit Bonheur&quot; and &quot;Le Tour de l&#x27;île&quot; in 2006.

==History==
Félix Leclerc was born in La Tuque, Quebec, Canada in 1914, the sixth in a family of eleven children. He began his studies at the University of Ottawa but was forced to stop because of the Great Depression.

Leclerc worked at several jobs before becoming a radio announcer in Québec City and Trois-Rivières from 1934 to 1937. In 1939, he began working as a writer at Radio-Canada in Montreal, developing scripts for radio dramas, including &quot;Je me souviens&quot;. He performed some of his earliest songs there. He also acted in various radio dramas, including &quot;Un homme et son péché&quot;. He published a number of scripts and founded a performing company which presented plays throughout Québec.

In 1950, he was discovered by Paris impresario, Jacques Canetti, and performed in France to great success. He signed a recording contract with Polydor Records. He returned to Québec in 1953. In 1958, he received the top award of the Académie Charles Cros in France for his second album. He was invested into the Order of Canada in 1971, the National Order of Québec and became a Chevalier of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1986.

Leclerc was the father of three children: the photographer and cameraman Martin Leclerc, film director Francis Leclerc and Nathalie Leclerc, general and artistic director of l’Espace Félix-Leclerc and vice-president of the Fondation Félix-Leclerc.

He died in his sleep in Saint-Pierre-de-l&#x27;Île-d&#x27;Orléans, Quebec, in 1988. A monument in his memory was constructed there in 1989. A house which he occupied from 1946 to 1967 (and where his son Martin stayed with his mother for another year) is also a museum in his honour in Vaudreuil-Dorion, west of Montréal.

Leclerc played a major role in revitalising the Québec folk song (&quot;chanson&quot;) tradition. He also was a strong voice for Quebec nationalism.

Several parks, roads, and schools in Québec have been named in his honour. The Félix Awards, given to Quebec recording artists, are named after him. In 2000, the Government of Canada honored him with a postage stamp.

His semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Pieds nus dans l&#x27;aube&quot; was adapted by his son, filmmaker Francis Leclerc, as the 2017 film &quot;Barefoot at Dawn&quot;.

<text>Mások (, &quot;Others&quot;) was Hungary&#x27;s first LGBTQ magazine, a social, cultural and human rights monthly, which existed for more than 17 years, from April 1991 to June 2008 (excluding its first unofficial issues, which were published from 1989 onwards). Its 200th issue was printed in November 2007. The word &quot;más&quot; (&quot;other,&quot; plural &quot;mások&quot;) is a Hungarian term that may refer to gay people.

From the early 2000s, it appeared on 76 pages (in B5 size) with news, reports, interviews, reviews, short stories, programmes, classifieds, and advertisements. Including information related to the entire LGBT community and aimed at the lesbian and transgender audience as well, it was mostly bought by gay men (partly because of its male softcore pictures).

&quot;Mások&quot; was available throughout Hungary, at all major newsagents (not usually in the shopwindow, though). Issues are stored and available in the archives of the two major Hungarian libraries (National Széchényi Library and Metropolitan Ervin Szabó Library), as well as IHLIA LGBT Heritage in Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and it was occasionally a point of reference for other newspapers.

<doc id="1107921" wikidata="Q3775954" url="?curid=1107921" title="N6 road (Ireland)">
<text>The N6 road is a national primary road in Ireland from junction 11 on the M4 motorway at Kinnegad to Galway city. The N6 and N4 form a continuous motorway or dual carriageway from Dublin city centre to Galway City, passing in an east–west direction through the midlands of Ireland. Most of the road is motorway standard (designated as M6 motorway) with the exception of the Athlone bypass and stretches of urban road in Galway City, which are the only sections of the road that remain designated as N6 dual carriageway. There is one toll on the road outside Galway city. Major upgrades to the road were completed in December 2009, completing the first intercity motorway/dual carriageway in Ireland and the New Junctions of M6 are built and will be 164 km.

==History==
Prior to the 2005–2009 construction of the road currently designated as the N6, the designation applied to the older, parallel Dublin–Galway route which went directly through most of the now bypassed towns from Kinnegad to Galway. That route is now mostly designated as R446, except the Athlone bypass which forms part of the new N6, a small section near Athlone now part of the N62 and a small section near Loughrea now part of the N65.
==Route==

The N6 route commences directly south of Kinnegad in County Meath as the M6 motorway. The road runs west into County Westmeath and bypasses Rochfordbridge, with the N52 joining the M6 east of Tyrrellspass. The N6 continues west, with the N52 leaving the route south of Kilbeggan. The route leaves Westmeath after bypassing Horseleap, continues west into County Offaly, and re-enters Westmeath bypassing Moate.

The route bypasses Fardrum (where the N62 begins, leaving the N6 to the south) heading west towards Athlone. The route follows a dual carriageway bypass of Athlone around the northern side of the town, crossing the River Shannon into County Roscommon. This part of the route is non-motorway standard. Along the dual carriageway there are local access junctions, as well as junctions for the N55 and N61.

After the Athlone bypass, the route continues as the M6, and motorway restrictions again apply. The route bypasses Ballinasloe over River Suck into County Galway. The N6 bypasses west through Aughrim and Kilreekil. Further west at Kilmeen, the N65 commences, leaving the M6 to the south. Loughrea is bypassed to the north by a route opened in November 2005. The River Dunkellin is crossed by the M6 at Craughwell as it continues west towards Galway. Outside the city itself, Oranmore is bypassed to the west and north, where the M18 crosses the M6. This dual carriageway bypass brings the route into Galway itself, where it meets the N83 along Bóthar na dTreabh. The Headford Road, Quincentenary Bridge across the River Corrib and Quincentenary Bridge Approach Road bring the N6 through Galway itself to meet the N59 on the western side of the city.

===Upgrade to Motorway (M6) Transport 21===

==Junctions==

The M6 junction numbers below are used on the entire length of the road. The Athlone bypass had a separate numbering scheme (J1–J6) but was renumbered to its current form (J8–J13) following the upgrade of the bypass in 2011.

<doc id="1107927" wikidata="Q646022" url="?curid=1107927" title="Degenerate music">
<text>Degenerate music (, ) was a label applied in the 1930s by the government of Nazi Germany to certain forms of music that it considered harmful or decadent. The Nazi government&#x27;s concerns about degenerate music were a part of its larger and better-known campaign against degenerate art (). In both cases, the government attempted to isolate, discredit, discourage, or ban the works.

==Racial emphasis==
Jewish composers such as Felix Mendelssohn and Gustav Mahler were disparaged and condemned by the Nazis. In Leipzig, a bronze statue of Mendelssohn was removed. The regime commissioned music to replace his incidental music to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

The Nazis also regulated jazz, including the banning of solos and drum breaks, scat, &quot;Negroid excesses in tempo&quot; and &quot;Jewishly gloomy lyrics&quot;.

==Discrimination==
From the Nazi seizure of power onward, these composers found it increasingly difficult, and often impossible, to get work or have their music performed. Many went into exile (e.g., Arnold Schoenberg, Kurt Weill, Paul Hindemith, Berthold Goldschmidt); or retreated into &quot;internal exile&quot; (e.g., Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Boris Blacher); or ended up in the concentration camps (e.g., Viktor Ullmann, or Erwin Schulhoff).

Like degenerate art, examples of degenerate music were displayed in public exhibits in Germany beginning in 1938. One of the first of these was organized in Düsseldorf by Hans Severus Ziegler, at the time superintendent of the Deutsches Nationaltheater Weimar, who explained in an opening speech that the decay of music was &quot;due to the influence of Judaism and capitalism&quot;.

Ziegler&#x27;s exhibit was organized into seven sections, devoted to:
# The influence of Judaism
# Arnold Schoenberg
# Kurt Weill and Ernst Krenek
# Minor Bolsheviks (Franz Schreker, Alban Berg, Ernst Toch, etc.)
# Leo Kestenberg, director of musical education before 1933
# Hindemith&#x27;s operas and oratorios
# Igor Stravinsky

From the mid-1990s the Decca Record Company released a series of recordings under the title &quot;Entartete Musik: Music Suppressed by the Third Reich&quot;, covering lesser-known works by several of the above-named composers.

<text>Robert Laxalt (September 25, 1923 – March 23, 2001) was a Basque-American writer from Nevada.

==Biography==
Robert Laxalt was born in 1923, a decade and a half after his father Dominique Laxalt and his mother Theresa Laxalt had emigrated to the United States in 1906 to herd sheep. His brother Paul Laxalt later became Governor of Nevada (1967–1971) and then a United States senator (1974–1986). After graduating from Carson City High School, Robert Laxalt attended Santa Clara University and then the University of Nevada at Reno.

Robert Laxalt began his writing career as a journalist working for United Press International, before starting his own news service in Nevada in the 1950s. In 1957, Laxalt published his second book &quot;Sweet Promised Land&quot;, which was widely read and remains his best-known work today. This book tells the story of Laxalt journeying with his father back to France. Laxalt later published over a dozen books, among which several (like &quot;Sweet Promised Land&quot; and &quot;The Basque Hotel&quot;) are biographical or semi-fictional accounts of his family&#x27;s history.

In 1961, Robert Laxalt founded the University of Nevada Press and served as its first editor.

==Basque identity==
From the Basque Oral History Project:
:Laxalt brought Basque identity to the forefront of those living in the Western States. Born on a livestock ranch during the Great Depression, he saw his father went out on the road doing whatever he could to make a living because of the depression. His mother heard that there was a Basque hotel in Carson City for sale named the French Hotel. The business went pretty well and even during Prohibition the hotels served wine. The clientele were more American than Basque. The politicians took a liking to Paul at the time, said he&#x27;d be governor some day. Eventually his father bought some ewes again and started buying private land so he would be able to run his sheep. He never wanted to be big again, because it was too risky. In the hotel there were also many miners, prospectors and buckaroos. In town, the Basques would wear their best suits every day. His father almost went crazy staying in the hotel, wanted to be outside in the mountains running sheep and cattle.

:They knew most of the other families in the area, would travel around all the time. His father had only one American sheepherder, but he lost sheep. The significance of the Basque hotels were that they were a home away from home for the sheepherders, where they could speak Basque, play cards and have good food. About the herders, what they did and how they felt about their lifestyle. Who were the best sheepherders according to someone, scots and irishmen but the Basques would always stay with the sheep and never leave them.

<text>Viktor Arkadyevich Bryzhin (, , &quot;Viktor Bryzgin;&quot; born 22 August 1962 in Voroshilovgrad) is a former Soviet athlete, winner of gold medal in 4 × 100 m relay at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

==Career==
Viktor Bryzhin trained at Dynamo in Voroshilovgrad. He made his debut in the international championships at the first World Championships, where he reached to the quarterfinal of 100 m and won a bronze as a member of Soviet 4 × 100 m relay team. At the 1986 European Championships, Bryzhin was last in the final of 100 m, but won the gold in 4 × 100 m.

At the 1987 World Championships, Bryzhin finished fifth in 100 m and was second in 4 × 100 m relay. At the Seoul Olympics, Bryzhin ran the opening leg in the Soviet 4 × 100 m relay team, which, in absence of United States won the gold medal. In 1988 he was awarded the title Honoured Master of Sports of the USSR. Bryzhin made his last appearance in the international athletics scene at the 1991 World Championships, where he finished seventh with the Soviet 4 × 100 m relay team.

His wife Olha Bryzhina (née Vladykina) was also a notable athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1988 Olympics. Together they have two daughters Yelizaveta Bryzhina and Anastasiia Bryzgina who are also a successful track and field athletes (competing for Ukraine).

<text>The West-Link () is a set of twin bridges over the River Liffey in Dublin. A toll bridge, the West Link forms the central section of the Western Parkway route of the M50 ring road motorway.

==History==
Plans were announced for the construction of the bridge in 1987, and launched by Minister for the Environment Pádraig Flynn. At the time it was expected to be the largest bridge ever built in the state and to cost in the region of £30 million. When complete, the expected toll was to cost the driver &quot;about sixty pence&quot;. The bridge was constructed as part of the first phase of the M50 motorway, and it and the section of motorway associated with it (Junctions 6-7) were the first section of the M50 to open in 1990. Built by NTR plc (then called National Toll Roads plc) under a deal with Dublin County Council, the bridge was an early example of public private partnership (although that term was not used at the time) and was the first section of toll motorway to open in the State. In return for constructing and maintaining the bridge, NTR received the right to operate it as a toll bridge for thirty years. Originally a single-span structure, a second span was completed and opened in September 2003. In 2007, the National Roads Authority reached a deal with NTR to buy out the toll bridge effective 1 August 2008. However, for traffic management purposes, a toll remained, a situation prompting widespread and ongoing criticism. NTR continued to operate the bridge until 29 August 2008 when at midnight eFlow took over. The toll plaza barriers were at that point replaced by overhead gantry-based electronic tolling.

== Structure ==
The bridge crosses the River Liffey at a point known as the Strawberry Beds. On the motorway it starts at a point approximately 2 km south of junction 6 (Blanchardstown) and runs to a point almost immediately north of junction 7 (Palmerstown). It is 385 metres long, and at its highest elevation, it is approximately 42 metres above the river. Figures from 2005 indicated that the bridge was carrying an average of 98,000 vehicles per day. The bridge is the only Liffey crossing between Chapelizod and Lucan Bridge (both of which are narrow two-lane structures) and thus it carries a large amount of traffic passing between the north and south Dublin suburbs.

== Tolling system ==

Since 30 August 2008, open road tolling has been in effect. Since 2022, the toll is €2.20 for cars on a tag account, €2.70 for cars whose number plates have been registered with eFlow on a video account, and €3.20 for unregistered cars. Unregistered vehicles can pay at Payzone outlets, by calling eFlow customer service or by paying on the eFlow website. Drivers who fail to pay receive escalating fines, depending on how long the toll remains unpaid.

Prior to 29 August 2008, tolling was usually by cash payment at a toll plaza to the former operators NTR plc. A prepaid tag system, Eazy Pass, has also been used since the early 2000s but was not barrier-free, unlike the present arrangements.

The tolling remains a single-point operation.

<text>Fort Breendonk (, ) is a former military installation at Breendonk, near Mechelen, Belgium, which served as a Nazi prison camp (&quot;Auffanglager&quot;) during the German occupation of Belgium during World War II.

Originally constructed between 1906 and 1913 as part of the second ring of the National Redoubt defending Antwerp, Fort Breendonk was used by the Belgian Army and was covered by a five-metre thick layer of soil for defense against artillery fire, a water-filled moat and measured . It was used in both World War I and World War II by which time it had become militarily obsolete.

Fort Breendonk was requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS) shortly after the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940 and used as a prison camp for the detention of political prisoners, resistance members, and Jews. Although technically a prison rather than a concentration camp, it became infamous for the poor living conditions in which the prisoners were housed and for the torture and executions which were carried out there. Most detainees were subsequently transferred to larger concentration camps in Eastern Europe. 3,590 prisoners are known to have been held at Fort Breendonk during the war of whom 303 died or were executed in the fort itself while 1,741 others subsequently died in other camps before the end of the war. In Belgian historical memory, Breendonk became symbolic of the barbarity of the German occupation.

The camp was evacuated ahead of the Liberation of Belgium by the Allies of World War II in September 1944. It was briefly repurposed to detain Belgian collaborators. It was declared a &quot;national memorial&quot; in 1947 and has subsequently been open to the public as a museum. Many of the camp&#x27;s personnel were subsequently tried for their wartime actions in Belgian courts.

==Construction and military use==

Fort Breendonk was originally built by the Belgian Army in 1906–13 as part of the second ring of defenses of the National Redoubt protecting the important port-city of Antwerp. It was covered by a five-metre thick layer of soil for defense against bombings, a water-filled moat and measured . It saw military service after the German invasion of Belgium in World War I. The siege of Antwerp begun in September 1914 and Breendonk came under fire from German howitzers out of range of its own guns on 1 October. However, the Germans successfully breached the Belgian line at Lier and were able to capture the city without making an assault on Breendonk. The fort&#x27;s garrison surrendered on 9 October 1914. Breendonk was used briefly in World War II but was already militarily obsolete. During the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, it served as the initial headquarters of the Belgian General Staff under King Leopold III but was abandoned as the Germans advanced. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, beginning a period of German occupation which lasted until September 1944.

== German prison camp: Breendonk I ==
Breendonk was occupied during the campaign of May 1940 and soon transformed into a prison camp which was controlled by SS and other security agencies of Nazi Germany—Sicherheitspolizei (SIPO) and Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in particular—although Belgium itself was under military (&quot;Wehrmacht&quot;) jurisdiction and controlled by General Alexander von Falkenhausen.

===Administration and inmates===
On 20 September 1940, the first prisoners arrived. Initially most of the prisoners were petty criminals, people deemed anti-social, or who did not conform to the German race laws. Later on, resistance fighters, political prisoners and ordinary people captured as hostages were detained as well. Another section was used as a transit camp for Jews being sent to death camps in Eastern Europe such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.

The camp was guarded by Flemish collaborationist paramilitaries as well as German SS units. Of the 300 prisoners that died in the camp itself, 185 were executed; many of the rest died of torture, disease or exposure. Most of those that did survive were transported to concentration camps. The German execution poles and gallows, as well as the torture chamber, are preserved in the current museum on the site.

Between 3,500 and 3,600 prisoners were incarcerated in Breendonk during its existence, of whom 1,733 died before liberation. About 400-500 were Jews. Most of the non-Jewish prisoners were left-wing members of the Belgian resistance or were held as hostages by the Germans. In September 1941, the Belgian Communist prisoners held at Breendonk were deported to Neuengamme concentration camp.

Jewish prisoners in Breendonk were segregated from other prisoners until 1942. Thereafter, Jews were transferred to the nearby Mechelen transit camp and deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.

===Daily life in the camp===

Upon arrival at the camp, new inmates were brought to the courtyard where they would have to stand facing the wall until they were processed into the camp. They were forbidden to move and any motion was severely punished. In the camp, punishment consisted of beatings, torture in the old gunpowder magazine, hanging or execution by firing squad. Inmates were forced to watch any executions that took place. The camp commander Lagerkommandant Philipp Schmitt was known to set his German Shepherd dog (called &quot;Lump&quot;) loose on the inmates. His wife was also known to wander the camp, ridiculing the inmates and ordering punishments at whim. Severe and arbitrary beating occurred daily. During winter 1942–1943, after the German defeat at Stalingrad, it occurred more than once that inmates, mostly Jewish, were forced by the Flemish SS guards to enter into the extremely cold water of the moat and kept there with a shovel. The victims gradually sank or fell into the mud and most of them, after a struggle that could last for over 15 minutes, finally drowned.
All the prisoners were subjected to forced labour. The camp authorities wanted the earth that had covered much of the Fort to be removed and shifted to build a high bank around the camp to hide it from outside view. In the few years Fort Breendonk was used by the Nazis, of soil covering the fort were removed by the prisoners by hand at a gruelling pace. Prisoners only had hand tools to complete this enormous task and the soil had to be transported to the outer wall via hand carts on a narrow gauge railway system. The ground in the camp was often very soggy causing the rails to sink away in the mud. Prisoners were then expected to move by hand the carts filled with dirt, pushing and dragging them back and forth over a distance of more than 300 meters. This regime was imposed for over 12 hours a day, seven days a week, even in the worst of weather conditions. Orders were given only in German, so inmates were forced to learn the basic commands rather quickly or otherwise be punished for failure to obey orders. Prisoners were also forced to salute and stand to attention every time a guard passed.

Accommodation in the fort consisted of the old barracks. Built from thick stone, without windows and with only minimal ventilation, these were extremely cold and damp. Each barrack room only had a small coal burning stove, and providing sufficient heating was nearly impossible. Rooms were originally designed for no more than 38 people, but frequently housed over 50 inmates sleeping in three-tier bunk beds on straw mattresses. The top bunks were highly prized. Inmates only had a single small bucket per room for a toilet during the night, and many of the sick and weakened inmates simply allowed their waste to drop down to the lower levels. This caused much fighting between inmates, which was probably what the guards wanted.
Prisoners were allowed to use the toilet in the given order only twice a day. There were two gathering spaces inside the fort, east and west, each one with a small building, made of brick and without doors, equipped with four holes and one urinal. Only in 1944 a greater facility was added. But to go to the toilet was always done under surveillance, in group and in a hurry: an additional opportunity for the guards to intimidate and humiliate the prisoners.

Jewish prisoners were segregated from other inmates and housed in specially constructed wooden barracks. These barracks were poorly insulated and over-crowded. Other prisoners were housed in cells, either in small groups or individually. The aim was to isolate certain prisoners for later interrogation and torture.

Food was severely rationed for the prisoners and distributed in different quantities to the various types of inmates. Jews received the least food and water. Prisoners were served three meals a day. Breakfast consisted of two cups of a coffee substitute made of roasted acorns and of bread. Lunch was usually one litre of soup (mostly just hot water). Supper was again two cups of a coffee substitute and of bread. This was far from enough to sustain a human being, especially considering the intense cold or heat, harsh labour and physical punishments the prisoners were subjected to.
This harsh treatment of prisoners started to leak outside the Fort to such a degree that the head of the administrative staff of the Military Governor of Belgium Eggert Reeder was compelled to order an inspection of the Fort because Von Falkenhausen &quot;did not want the camp to become known to history as the hell of Breendonk&quot;. But the respite was short lived also because the SS seized and forwarded to Germany most of the food parcels sent in by the Red Cross.

Conditions in the camp were so cruel and harsh that those who left alive were so weak that their chances of survival at the final destination were severely hampered. Often prisoners were so sick and weak that they were led straight to the gas chambers or simply died within weeks of their arrival. The regime in the camp was at least as harsh as in an actual concentration camp. On 4 September 1944 the SS evacuated the Fort, and all the remaining prisoners were sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. Fewer than 10 percent of the inmates survived the war.

Particular controversy surrounds the Flemish SS guards of the camp, who so openly and cruelly turned against their fellow countrymen in support of their Nazi paymasters. The memoirs of Charles Arnold-Baker, who was the British officer responsible for taking over the camp from the remaining staff, makes reference to this event.

===Notable inmates===
Famed author, philosopher, and journalist Jean Améry (formerly Hans Mayer) was captured by the Nazis in July 1943 while fighting with Belgian Resistance. He was subsequently sent to Fort Breendonk, where he was severely tortured before being sent to Auschwitz. Améry discussed his experiences in a book he wrote about the dehumanization that occurred between victim and perpetrator during the Holocaust, a work he entitled &quot;At the Mind&#x27;s Limits&quot;.

Comics artist Marc Sleen also spent time in Breendonk, together with his brother, because his third brother was a member of the resistance. The Nazis hoped to hear them out about the whereabouts of their brother, but they never betrayed him. As a consequence Sleen, his brother and other prisoners were put in a death cell, where one of them was shot every day. By the time it was Sleen&#x27;s turn he was lucky that D-Day had occurred, causing a mass panic among the prison guards. They took every prisoner with them to another camp, where Sleen was able to escape. Yet he would suffer post-traumatic nightmares about these experiences for the rest of his life.

The artist Jacques Ochs was interned in Breendonk from 1940 to 1942, when he managed to escape. A few of the drawings he made during his time there had survived. He used them after the war to reconstruct scenes of life in the camp, and in 1947 published those in the book &quot;Breendonck – Bagnards et Bourreaux&quot; (&quot;Breendonck – Slave Laborers and Hangmen&quot;).

== Allied prison: Breendonk II ==

The officer of the British Army designated to liberate the camp late in 1944 was Charles Arnold-Baker, a German and officer in MI6. After VE Day, Eileen Younghusband, a WAAF officer and fluent French-speaker, acted as a guide to RAF personnel visiting the camp. She had been in Germany prior to the start of the war, and had encountered fleeing Jews. During the German bombing of Britain, she had been a radar filter officer giving warning of air raids. When the German V-2 ballistic missile attacks on London and elsewhere began in 1944, she was sent to Belgium with mathematicians to help locate V-2 launch sites.

Fort Breendonk was briefly repurposed as an internment camp for Belgian collaborators. This period of the Fort&#x27;s existence is known as &quot;Breendonk II&quot;. The internees were moved to Dossin Barracks, Mechelen, on 10 October 1944.

==Later significance==
===War crimes trials===

Trials of the Flemish SS guards, considered Nazi collaborators, were held during 1946 in Mechelen and including some guards and officials at Fort Breendonk.

Of those who were convicted, 18 were sentenced to be executed by firing squad in 1947, two of which appealed their case and had their sentences revised to life imprisonment. Four others were sentenced to life in prison, one to 20 years in prison, and one other was acquitted, and two guards who were sentenced to life were never found.

The Nazi camp commandant, Philipp Schmitt, was tried in Antwerp in 1949 as a war criminal; the court martial sentenced him to death and was shot by a firing squad on 9 August 1950. He never showed any remorse and denied all of the atrocities that occurred at Breendonk, claiming he was merely re-educating the inmates as he had been ordered.

===Museum and memorial===

In 1947 Fort Breendonk was declared to be a national memorial, recognizing the suffering and cruelty that had been inflicted on Belgian prisoners during World War II. The fort is now a well-preserved example of the prison camps operated by Nazi Germany and a national museum. The Fort is open to visitors all year round and is located close to the A12 Brussels-Antwerp motorway.

Pictures of working Nazi internment camps during the war are rare and, for a long time, it was believed that absolutely no pictures of Breendonk during the war existed. But in the early 1970s a batch of photos of the camp was discovered in the possessions of Dutch photographer Otto Spronk. He had collected thousands of pictures and films of the Third Reich as part of his work for the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (Cegesoma). The collection consisted of 37 pictures depicting daily life in the camp. They were taken by German Nazi photographer Otto Kropf for propaganda purposes but were never used. All pictures are essentially cliche stills; none of the daily atrocities or horrors of the camp are shown. But they are the only reference material available. Several of the inmates on the pictures managed to survive the war and were able to identify the others on the pictures and the circumstances in which they were taken.

<text>The Subaru Leone is a compact car produced by the Japanese car manufacturer Subaru from 1971 to 1994. The word &quot;leone&quot; is Italian for lion.

It was released as a replacement for the Subaru 1000 and was the predecessor of the Subaru Impreza. All Leones were powered by the Subaru EA boxer engine. Most cars were equipped with optional four-wheel drive. At the time of its introduction, the Leone was Subaru&#x27;s top model until 1989, when the larger Legacy was introduced.

Although released in Japan and some export markets as the Leone, for many years, this was the only vehicle sold internationally by Subaru where the smaller kei cars Rex, Vivio, R-2, 360, and Sambar were not commonly sold. As a result, in major markets such as Australia, Europe and North America, it was instead identified with a trim level designation, some of which included: DL, GL, GLF, GLF5, GL-10, and RX. The car is thus often referred to simply as the Subaru GL or the Subaru L series.

== First generation (A21/22/62/64/65) ==
The first generation Leone was released on October 7, 1971, as a front-wheel drive coupé, with trim levels DL, GL and GSR. April 1972 saw the introduction of the two- and four-door sedans with trim levels DL, GL and in Japan, the Super Touring. At its introduction, the Leone was Subaru&#x27;s largest car, and was the top level vehicle above the &quot;kei&quot; car Subaru Rex.

In September 1972, the four-wheel drive (4WD) station wagon (A67) was released, however it did not appear in the United States until 1974 as a 1975 model. The Leone was introduced before the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo to emphasize its durability in adverse weather conditions. Up until this time four-wheel drive had been limited mainly to off-road vehicles, although the very expensive Jensen FF had been built in limited numbers.

Subaru broke this pattern by introducing a mass-produced four-wheel drive passenger car, after having tested the waters by building a limited series of four-wheel drive FF-1 1300G wagons in 1971. Four-wheel drive was Subaru&#x27;s most notable feature during the 1970s and 1980s, leading to particularly strong sales in places like Switzerland and Colorado. The Leone competed with the Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sunny, Honda Civic, Mazda Familia, Isuzu Gemini, and the Mitsubishi Lancer. The Leone introduced a Subaru tradition of frameless side windows for all models.

In August 1968, Subaru entered into an alliance with Nissan Motors. The appearance of the new Leone was influenced by the design efforts from Nissan, especially the long hood and short trunk appearance that Nissan was using at that time for their own products. The 1400 RX coupé, based on the previously introduced GSR, was one of the first Japanese automobiles to be equipped with four-wheel disc brakes, a sport-tuned suspension and a 5-speed manual transmission. A two-door hardtop coupé, with different bodywork than the two-door sedan or two-door coupé, was introduced in June 1973. The hardtop coupé received model names containing the letter F for &quot;Formal&quot; (FL, GF, GFT). A 4WD version with the sedan bodywork (model code A27) appeared in 1975. In the Japanese market, the sedan had to be equipped with the SEEC-T desmogged EA71 engine producing , whereas the station wagon was classified as a commercial vehicle and thus received a version of the same engine.

The Leone was originally equipped with a 1.2- or a 1.4-litre flat-four, carbureted, OHV engine. The 1,100 cc engine from the earlier FF-1 G was carried over for the Leone 1100 van in the Japanese domestic market, but was only available in the first few years. In September 1975, as a response to tightening emissions regulations, the 1.2 was removed from the sedan lineup (although it continued to be available as a van-wagon version in the Japanese domestic market). To be able to offer as much power as the pre-smog 1.4 a bigger, 1.6-litre version was added for 1976. In Europe, the 1.6 arrived during 1977. Fitted with twin, Hitachi register carburetors the European-spec engine produces a claimed at 5,600 rpm, with maximum torque of at 3,600 rpm.

The Leone was available with a four-speed manual transmission, a five-speed manual transmission, and also a three-speed automatic transmission beginning in 1975. Some early models had duo-servo drum brakes at the front, however, later models were equipped with disc brakes. All models originally had rear drum brakes except the RX coupés. Unusually, the handbrake or emergency brake operated on the front wheels.

In March 1977, an updated Leone range was released. All body panels were altered slightly and the overall look was &#x27;smoother&#x27; and more contemporary in appearance. A completely new dashboard with altered interior were also part of the update. Despite these changes the overall effect was similar to the earlier version and it was mechanically identical, with the exception of the rear track which was widened by . The chassis codes were changed, with sedans now in the 30 series and estates in the 60 series. The little 1.2 continued to be available in the lowliest standard van model, with . In November 1977, a new top model arrived, the Leone Grand Am-T, which adopted the federalized safety bumpers and had an interior &quot;inspired by American tastes.&quot;

The Leone entered Australia and New Zealand in 1973, with cars imported fully assembled from Japan. The 4WD Wagon entered the Australian market in 1975, and remained the only vehicle in its class until the early 1980s. Many versions - sedan, wagon and Brumby (BRAT) coupe utility, were also assembled from CKD kits, from 1978, in New Zealand by then-importer Motor Holdings&#x27; Waitara plant near New Plymouth. Local assembly ceased when the Legacy range replaced the Leone in 1993.

===North America===

The Leone was first introduced to the United States in 1972. In 1976 the EA63 engine was replaced with the 1.6 liter EA71 engine. The EA71 engine was originally installed in cars equipped with automatic transmission but eventually supplanted the EA63 across the entire range of vehicles in the US and Australia. Using Subaru&#x27;s new SEEC-T technology meant that a catalytic converter was not necessary, lowering cost and enabling the use of leaded fuel. Power in 49-state (US) trim was at 5200 rpm (two horsepower less in California), although drivability and gas mileage suffered distinctly from the emissions equipment. The Wagon was also available with four-wheel drive, beginning with the 1977 model year.

A print ad for the 1973 Subaru GL coupé referred to the engine as &quot;quadrozontal&quot;. The large bumpers required in the United States sat on hydraulic units; these were not a part of the original design and thus intruded considerably into the luggage compartment.

Late 1977 saw the introduction of the Subaru BRAT as a 1978 model. This was a two-seater body with a pickup truck bed, with two seats welded into the bed to evade the so-called &quot;chicken tax&quot; on light commercial vehicles. It brought the U.S. lineup to eight models in three trim levels. Most were in the volume DL trim except a base two-door, and the GF hardtop and 4WD models which shared a higher specification. For 1979, a decontented DL 4WD wagon and BRAT were added along with fancier GL four-door sedan and 2WD wagon models bringing the total to twelve, the original fully equipped 4WDs also getting the DL designation. The original BRAT was updated for 1981 with a dual-range 4WD transmission and the 1.8-litre EA81 engine. This was sold alongside the second-generation Leone (introduced in 1979) until the 1982 model year.

== Second generation (AB/AM/AF/AJ) ==
In June 1979 the Leone saw its first complete model update. This generation was released with a two-door hardtop coupé, four-door sedan, station wagon and a three-door hatchback. Export sales began in the fall with the 1980 model year. The earlier two-door sedan was replaced by a three-door hatchback design (&quot;Swingback&quot; in Japan), as an alternative to contemporary hatchback competitors. The Swingback, however, differed from its competitors in offering the option of four-wheel-drive.

New for this generation was a dual-range four-speed 4WD transmission with both hi/lo range gearing and manual ride height adjustment on the 4WD models. In November 1981 Subaru introduced Japan&#x27;s first all-wheel-drive vehicle with an automatic transmission, utilizing the world&#x27;s first &quot;wet hydraulic multi-plate clutch&quot;. This allowed the driver to engage 4WD with a simple push of a button rather than shifting a lever as in the manual models. The electric switch activated a solenoid that pushed the clutch plates together, thereby engaging the driveshaft to the rear wheels.

A new 1.8 L EA81 engine was added to the lineup from the beginning. In November 1983, a turbocharger with optional multi-port fuel injection was also added to the BRAT and Turbo Wagon models. They were only available with an automatic transmission and 3.70:1 gearing. In Japan the top-spec 1800 GTS sedan was the first Subaru to offer air conditioning, power windows, and power steering. The installation of a turbocharger was to provide better fuel economy by reducing emissions and burning fuel more effectively as opposed to providing a performance oriented product, due to taxes levied by the Japanese Government on a graduated scale based on the emissions emitted from the car.

===Export markets===
This generation of hatchback and BRAT were made alongside the third-generation offerings until 1987 for the BRAT in the United States (1993 in some markets and 1994 in Latin America) and 1989 for the hatchback. All other second generation models were discontinued by 1985.

;United States
In the United States, the trim level of a vehicle could be identified by the headlights – early GLs had square while others had round; later GLs had quad square headlights and lower series had single squares, with 1982 being a transition year (2WD GL=quad square, 4WD GL=single square with third light, all DLs=single square, STD hatchback=single round). 1980–1982 models also featured an optional third headlight hidden behind the grille logo, using a similar approach used by Chrysler in the late 1960s called the Super-Lite. The logo moved up and out of the way when the driver activated a switch on the dash, revealing the extra headlight and activating it when the high-beams were illuminated.

;Australia
Australian buyers originally only received the option of a 1.6-liter engine coupled with a four-speed manual transmission. It was available as a four-door sedan or as a 4WD wagon.

== Third generation (AA/AL/AG)==
On July 16, 1984, the Leone saw its second major redesign utilizing what was called &quot;folded paper&quot; appearance. This generation was released with a three-door hatchback, four-door sedan and a continuation of the popular station wagon body style. This generation Leone made its way to the United States in 1985. The liftback coupé was hamstrung by a very high rear cargo lip, but did receive a split folding rear seat.

In Europe, the range was 1.3 DL, 1.6 DL, 1.6 GL, 1.8 DL, and 1.8 GL 4WD. There were also Turbo versions, with in catalyzed specifications. Not all versions were offered in all countries.

In North America, the 1.6-liter engine was dropped completely from the lineup, due to its lack of power. The 1.3 was only available in select markets. For 1987, the Leone received a facelift with a smoothed out appearance.

A new 1.8-liter SOHC engine, EA82 was offered instead of the OHV 1.8-liter flat-four engine. The engine was available with a carburetor, single point fuel injection, multi-port fuel injection, or multi-port fuel injection with a turbocharger.

From 1988 this generation saw the availability of a full-time 4WD manual transmission or a full-time 4WD four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission.

Other options found in the third generation Leone were a full digital instrument panel; self diagnostic computer, travel computer, cruise control and pneumatic suspension with selectable height,(previous generations 4WD models had manual height adjustment).

The performance oriented sedan was introduced in 1985, and reusing a trim package designation RX first introduced in 1986. It was installed with the EA82T turbo engine mated to a five speed manual transmission with synchronized dual-range and a manually-locking center differential. It had a 3.70:1 rear Limited Slip Differential, rally tuned suspension, four wheel disc brakes, power windows, A/C, central locking differential, adjustable seats and steering wheel, split fold-down rear seats, and hill holder. Weight was . The RX coupe was introduced in 1987, and the automatic transmission version was introduced in 1989, its final year of production. Only 2,600 coupes were made, 1,500 sedans were sold in the first year, and was replaced by the Subaru WRX.

From September 1988 until July 1993, the van version was also provided to Isuzu as the &quot;Geminett II&quot; under an OEM deal.

By 1990 the Leone name continued to be used in Japan but was now known as the Loyale in Chile, the United States and Canada; the L-Series in Europe and Australia, and as the Omega in New Zealand where the third generation was the last to be assembled locally by Motor Holdings at Waitara. The popularity of the Leone wagon was ceded to the new, larger, Legacy wagon in 1989 and was ultimately replaced by the Impreza in 1994. The Impreza was introduced with a &#x27;hatch like&#x27; wagon which was reminiscent of the first and second generation Leone wagons.

There were no third generation BRAT/Brumby/MV pickup as the range was discontinued after 1987. There was however a concept for a Subaru Suiren and the next generation Subaru Baja.

=== World Rally Championship ===
Subaru Rally Team Japan led by Noriyuki Koseki (founder of Subaru Tecnica International STI) ran Subaru Leone coupé, sedan DL and RX Turbo in the World Rally Championship between 1980 and 1989 a few rallies per season. Drivers for individual rallies included Ari Vatanen, Per Eklund, Shekhar Mehta, Mike Kirkland, Possum Bourne, Frank Tundo, Harald Demut and Chilean driver Jose Antonio Celsi. Mike Kirkland finished 6th overall and won the A Group at the 1986 Safari Rally. That year Subaru was one of the only manufacturers combining 4WD and turbo. Jose Antonio Celsi finished eight in the 1986 Marlboro Rally Argentina and fifth in the 1988 Marlboro Rally Argentina. During 1989 Subaru entry two works RX Turbo for Jose Antonio Celsi and Possum Bourne. Celsi finished fourth, but retired on the final road section and Bourne retired during the first stage. Subaru changed the rally model to Legacy RS for the 1990–1992 period and took part in the first complete season in the World Rally Championship with the same model in 1993.

== Leone Delivery Van ==
Introduced in August 1994, the Subaru Leone Van was a badge engineered version of the Nissan AD van for light commercial uses. The Leone&#x27;s successor Legacy and Impreza did not compete in this segment. It was sold in two generations until the 2001 model year. In March 2001, sales of the Leone Van ended. The Sambar, which had grown larger due to changes in mini vehicle standards, was beginning to compete with the Leone Van. The name of &quot;Leone&quot; ended after three decades. At the same time, it meant Subaru&#x27;s withdrawal from the small truck market.

<doc id="1107950" wikidata="Q4679475" url="?curid=1107950" title="Adam McPhee">
<text>Adam McPhee (born 6 October 1982) is an Australian rules football player who played for the Fremantle Football Club and the Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is a versatile player who has played both as a forward, defender and tagging role, with high-profile clashes with Gary Ablett, Jr. and Chris Judd in 2010.

== Australian Football League career ==

=== First stint at Fremantle ===

McPhee was originally recruited by Fremantle from the Dandenong Stingrays in the TAC Cup with the 39th selection in the 2000 AFL Draft. He made his AFL debut in 2001 and was nominated for the AFL Rising Star award that year. By the end of 2002, McPhee played 25 games in total for the Dockers. He was then traded to Essendon in his home state of Victoria in a three-way deal also involving Brisbane. Essendon had previously hoped to draft him late in the 2000 draft, but Fremantle had picked him ahead of where Essendon had expected him to be taken.

=== Essendon years ===

In McPhee&#x27;s first year at Essendon he played every game and his tough approach earned him the club&#x27;s &quot;most courageous player&quot; award. However it was in 2004 that McPhee really made his mark as an AFL player. In that year he was selected on the half-back flank in the All-Australian team, won the W.S. Crichton Medal as Essendon&#x27;s best and fairest player and was Essendon&#x27;s highest vote getter in the Brownlow Medal.

In 2005, McPhee was restricted to only 14 games through injury and could not repeat his feats of 2004.

On 30 July 2006, McPhee played his 100th senior game at the Telstra Dome. It was capped off with a win over the Brisbane Lions which broke, what was at the time, the club&#x27;s longest streak without a win in its history, when he took a spectacular mark and also kicked a magnificent goal on the run. He missed out on the honour the previous week because of a one match suspension served for striking St Kilda&#x27;s Robert Harvey in an attempted spoil.

On 25 April 2009, in the Anzac Day match, McPhee celebrated his 150th game with a five-point victory over Collingwood.

=== Return to Fremantle ===
After long discussions about a new contract with the Bombers, McPhee did not sign a new contract with Essendon by the 2.00pm deadline on 10 November 2009. Many believe McPhee left Essendon due to a fall out with the Coach of Essendon at the time, Matthew Knights. McPhee was expected to nominate to be drafted to another club and as expected, his former club Fremantle selected him with their selection in the pre-season draft. The possible move to Fremantle had been heavily criticised in some circles, partly as a result of the club&#x27;s recent history in drafting mature-age recruits, but it has been applauded in other circles as the club gave up virtually nothing to land him. His first match against his old club Essendon saw him hit the post twice, drop marks and kick out of bounds on the full right in front of Bombers fans who booed him consistently throughout the match. Despite his clangers, Fremantle managed to upset Essendon by 44 points.

After McPhee&#x27;s tough start in his return to Fremantle, he improved as the season went on after a change in role. McPhee played his best football for the Dockers towards the end of the season as a run-with player (tagger), a role which requires stopping the influence of the opposition team&#x27;s most damaging players. McPhee&#x27;s best game came against Hawthorn in the Elimination final, keeping Hawks champion Luke Hodge to just 13 disposals, and only 5 in the first three quarters.

In 2012 McPhee returned to the backline under new coach Ross Lyon, but mainly played on the smaller forwards.

At the end of the 2012 season, a month after signing a one-year contract extension, McPhee retired from AFL football for family reasons. While there was much speculation he would return to his former club, the Essendon Football Club, he returned to Melbourne to work for his father-in-law&#x27;s company. He continues to play football and as of 2015 is playing for St Mary&#x27;s in the Geelong Football League.

<text>Philip Nicholas Furbank FRSL (; 23 May 1920 – 27 June 2014) was an English biographer, critic and academic. His most significant biography was the well-received life of his friend E. M. Forster.

== Career ==
Born in Cranleigh in 1920, Furbank, after having attended Reigate Grammar School, entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge. After graduating with a First in English, he served in the army. He became a corporal in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and was in Italy in 1945. He returned to Emmanuel as a teaching Fellow in 1947. While in Cambridge Furbank became a close friend of the novelist E. M. Forster, and also of the mathematician Alan Turing, whose literary executor he would become.

Furbank moved to London in 1953 and worked as an editor and librarian. He contributed reviews to &quot;The Listener&quot;. In 1972 he became a professor of the Open University

In 1960 in London he married the poet and critic Patricia Beer. The marriage was dissolved by 1964 when she remarried.

==Works==
Furbank&#x27;s best known work was his sympathetic and widely acclaimed biography &quot;E. M. Forster: A Life&quot;. Forster had recognised that a biography was inevitable and had originally asked the novelist William Plomer to write one. Plomer found it impossible to describe Forster&#x27;s sexuality and Furbank was asked instead. Forster&#x27;s old college, King&#x27;s College, made Furbank a fellow for the two years before Forster&#x27;s death in 1970 to support the writing, and the biography was published in two volumes in 1977 and 1978.

Furbank won a Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism for his &quot;Diderot: A Critical Biography&quot; (1992). He also edited the works of Daniel Defoe and made major contributions to the question of attributions to Defoe in &quot;A Critical Bibliography of Daniel Defoe&quot;, &quot;The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe&quot;, and &quot;A Political Biography of Daniel Defoe&quot; all co-written with W. R. Owens. Furbank also helped oversee the publication of Alan Turing&#x27;s collected works.

Furbank&#x27;s other works include books on the poet Mallarmé, the painter Poussin, the novelists Samuel Butler and Italo Svevo, and &quot;Behalf&quot; (1999) on political thought.

<text>The N3 road is a national primary road in the Republic of Ireland, running between Dublin, Cavan and the border with County Fermanagh. The A509 and A46 roads in Northern Ireland form part of an overall route connecting to Enniskillen, and northwest to the border again where the N3 reappears to serve Ballyshannon in County Donegal.

Rush hour congestion between Navan and Dublin city was very heavy (up to 22,000 vehicles per day on single carriageway portions of the N3 in 2002), and problems occurred at most built-up areas between these points. A tolled motorway bypass replacement, the M3 motorway, was opened to traffic on 4 June 2010.

The former section from its junction with the M50 to Dublin city centre, as well as the bypassed section from Clonee to the border with County Cavan, have been reclassified as the R147 road.

==Route==

The route, known as the Navan Road as it leaves Dublin, starts at its junction with the M50 motorway (junction 6), bypassing Blanchardstown, Mulhuddart and Clonee with a dual carriageway opened in November 1992. The dual carriageway changes into the M3 motorway near the Meath border bypassing Dunshaughlin and Navan. Near Kells the route continues as the N3 dual carriageway to the border with County Cavan. It then passes through Virginia, past Cavan and continues past Butlersbridge and Belturbet.

The route then crosses the border into Northern Ireland at the Senator George Mitchell Peace Bridge (also known as Aghalane Bridge), which spans the Woodford River (Irish: &quot;Sruth Gráinne&quot;), crossing into County Fermanagh where it becomes the A509, continuing on to Enniskillen. The A46 (known as the Lough Shore Road) connects Enniskillen and the County Donegal border, becoming the N3 across the border at Belleek, and connecting to Ballyshannon. In Ballyshannon certain road signs have destinations A46 Enniskillen with N3 Dublin with the requisite single arrow pointing in the same direction.

==History==
During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the border crossing at Aghalane Bridge, which spanned the Woodford River just north of Belturbet, was closed. Aghalane Bridge crossed from County Cavan into County Fermanagh. The bridge was targeted by Loyalist paramilitaries and finally left impassable in 1973. The shortest route was along the N87 and A32 via Swanlinbar. The crossing was reopened in 1999 when a new bridge, named after US Senator George Mitchell, was built beside the old Aghalane Bridge.

==N3 upgrade==
The National Roads Authority in conjunction with Cavan and Donegal County Councils plan major improvements to the N3 route in Ulster.

A 6.7 kilometre bypass of the town of Belturbet in County Cavan was partially opened to traffic on 2 August 2013, and the entire section including a bridge over the River Erne was opened in December 2013.

==M3 motorway==
Part of the old N3 route has been bypassed by the construction of 51 kilometres of new motorway. This stretch of motorway, designated M3, was opened on 4 June 2010. The M3 begins near the end of the dual carriageway outside Clonee and terminates south west of Kells just before the N52. The works were carried out by a joint venture of Ferrovial and SIAC (a local contractor).

The construction scheme did not terminate at this point as a new realigned N3 2+2 non-motorway section continued from the end of the Motorway past Kells before terminating near the County Cavan border. The overall scheme also included the N52 Kells northern bypass. Since completion, the M3 now bypasses Dunshaughlin, Navan, and Kells along with Cavan which was bypassed much earlier.

===Controversy===

The motorway was contested because the route passes near the Hill of Tara and through the archaeologically rich Tara-Skryne valley or Gabhra. The planned route corridor was approved by An Bord Pleanála (Ireland&#x27;s planning appeals board) in August 2003.

===Motorway reclassification===
On 30 September 2008, the Department of Transport announced the second round of proposed motorway reclassifications under the Roads Act 2007. A short section of the existing dual-carriageway N3 bypassing Clonee, from northwest of Mulhuddart to the start of the M3 toll motorway scheme, is affected by this. Following a public consultation process, on 10 July 2009 the Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, made a Statutory Instrument reclassifying this section of the N3 as motorway effective from 28 August 2009. It was the first section of M3 to come into being.

===Motorway project details===
* The most expensive single contract road project ever undertaken in Ireland coming in at approximately €650 million according to SIAC.
* It is tolled at two locations, one point north of Navan and another point between Dunshaughlin and Clonee for 45 years running from 2007. The Government have the option to buy out this contract at any time. The price level of tolls are controlled by the Board of the NRA and they can reduce, increase or remove the tolls as they see appropriate. Should they lower the tolls on the M3 the government would have to make up the difference of what is owed yearly to Eurolink M3 Ltd through tax revenue. 
* An expected minimum traffic level, growing year-on-year, was agreed as part of the contract, with &quot;Variable Operational Payments&quot; made in lieu of toll revenue to Eurolink M3 if this figure was not reached. These payments were made every year from opening until 2019, with traffic below predicted levels; but it is now expected that no further payments will be required due to traffic growth 
* It is the longest single road project ever to be constructed in Ireland including nearly 100 kilometres of new or upgraded road including 49 km of new M3, 10 km of new N3, 20 km of new link roads and interchanges, and approximately 15 kilometres of local road improvements, footpaths, cycle lanes and new bridges.
* It was originally planned to open in 2006.
* An Bord Pleanála initially approved the project on 22 August 2003. Exactly 4 years later, on 22 August 2007, they directed that the excavation of the Lismullin monument did not require fresh planning approval.

== Junctions == 

The route begins as a dual carriageway at junction 6 of the M50, becoming a motorway after junction 4. It then becomes a dual carriageway after the motorway which terminates at Kells.

<text>Jalaf ibn Rashid ibn Asad () was a lieutenant of Bahlul Ibn Marzuq, the rebel leader of the Zaragoza region in Spain, who conquered Huesca in 800.

When Bahlul was defeated by troops sent by the Spanish Wāli and fled to Pallars, he was killed by Jalaf ibn Rashid in 802. Recompensed by the government of Huesca and Barbitanya (region of Barbastro), Jalaf controlled Huesca for about sixty years (802–862) when it was transferred to the Banu Qasi and subsequently to Musa ibn Galindo, a scion of the Kings of Pamplona. Jalaf&#x27;s family, the Banu Jalaf, continued to rule in Barbitanya for another two decades.

<text>Humphrey Spender (19 April 1910 – 11 March 2005) was a British photographer, painter, and designer.

==Family and education==
Humphrey Spender was the third son of Harold Spender, a journalist and writer. Humphrey&#x27;s mother, Violet Schuster, came from a German family who had emigrated to Britain in the 1870s. Violet died in 1921 and Harold Spender died in 1926. Humphrey had two brothers, the poet Stephen Spender and the scientist and explorer Michael Spender, and one sister, Christine.

As a child, Humphrey learnt photography from his older brother Michael Spender and was given a handsome German camera for his tenth birthday. After attending Gresham&#x27;s School, Spender initially studied art history at Freiburg University for a year, where he spent time with his brother, Stephen Spender, and other literary figures including Christopher Isherwood. During this period he gained exposure to continental European avant-garde photography and film. He enrolled at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, but became disinclined to practice as an architect. Soon after graduating from the school Spender decided to make a career in photography.

==Career==
He went on to set up a photography studio on the Strand with Bill Edmiston, who was his lover. Spender was renowned for his commercial photography. During this time he took photographs for advertisements as well as magazines like &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. In the mid-1930s, he was recruited to work for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; under the nickname &#x27;Lensman&#x27;.

Spender became a member of the Mass Observation movement, taking pictures of daily life in working class communities. His most famous photographs are of the &#x27;Worktown Study&#x27;. (Worktown was the Mass Observationist&#x27;s codename for Bolton). Taken in a period between 1937 and 1940, his photographs cover the full range of Mass-Observation&#x27;s interests – politics and elections; religion; street scenes; industrial landscapes; the public house; market scenes; new buildings and developments; observers in action; sport and leisure time; work in the textile mills; on holiday in Blackpool; street hoardings and advertisements. Spender was joined in this project by the artist, Graham Bell.Toward the end of his involvement with Mass Observation, Spender also took on work as a photographer for the recently established, highly successful photographically illustrated magazine Picture Post.

With the coming of World War II, Spender served briefly in the Royal Army Service Corps before being appointed an official war photographer. He also worked as an interpreter of photo-reconnaissance pictures, identifying German rocket sites and making maps for D-Day.

In December 1944 during World War II, Spender was staying at the Hotel Gruenwalder in Innsbruck, Austria as part of his reconnaissance work with the Royal Army Service Corps. On 17 December, Spender encountered Heinrich Himmler, the notorious head of the Nazi SS who had arrived at the hotel unannounced armed with a team of soldiers. Himmler was seated at a table when Spender walking past, was asked to approach him and speak in German. Because of his mother&#x27;s German-Jewish ancestry and his time spent in Germany, Spender luckily was conversant in the language and quietly left the hotel unnoticed. Otherwise it would have meant certain death for him because of his background.

Spender also recounted a time he heard Adolf Hitler speak at a public gathering in Berlin in 1939. He said his voice was &quot;very powerful and commanding&quot;.

In about 1955 he abandoned photography for painting and textile design, and taught at the Royal College of Art from 1953 until he retired in 1975.

In 1968, Spender moved to Maldon, Essex, where he lived at The Studio, Ulting. This was the first built design by architect Richard Rogers.

==Marriages==
Spender&#x27;s first wife, Margaret Low, with whom he adopted a son, died in 1945. His second wife, Pauline Wynn, with whom he had a son, died in 2003. He then married the photographer Rachel Hewitt, who was more than fifty years younger.

Spender had told his wives before marrying them that he was bisexual, like his brother Stephen Spender, and he had affairs with both men and women throughout his life, including Frederick Ashton and Eslanda Goode Robeson.

<text>The Banu Khalaf was an Arab family that ruled Huesca and the region called Barbitanya on the Iberian Peninsula from about 802 to 862, and Barbitanya alone from 862 to about 882.

The first ruler was Khalaf Ibn Rashid (802), who settled with his clan in the village they named Midayar, modern Barbastro. The city castle (Barbastra) was the centre of the Muslim domain in the region.

Khalaf died before 862. In this year the government of Huesca was conferred on the Banu Qasi family. His son Abd Allah ibn Khalaf then ruled Barbitanya. In the 870s, he allied himself with rebel Isma&#x27;il ibn Musa al-Qasawi, to whom Abd Allah married his daughter. In retaliation, at the end of the decade Muhammad I of Córdoba entered Huesca and killed Abd Allah and all of his children, and took possession of the Banu Jalaf lands.

<doc id="1107980" wikidata="Q2677720" url="?curid=1107980" title="N2 road (Ireland)">
<text>The N2 road is a national primary road in Ireland, running from Dublin to the border with Northern Ireland at &quot;Moy Bridge&quot; near Aughnacloy, County Tyrone to connect Dublin with Derry and Letterkenny via the A5. A section of the route near Dublin forms the M2 motorway.
== Route ==
The N2 commences at junction 5 of the M50 motorway. It then runs as a dual-carriageway for 17 km (10.5 miles) from the M50 to north of Ashbourne, County Meath. This project was opened on 25 May 2006, and includes 3.5 km (2.2 miles) of three lane dual carriageway built to motorway standard. The route is the first to have a 120 km/h (75 mph) special speed limit. According to the project engineers, the National Roads Authority decided due to the lack of available space at the M50 junction to accommodate a parallel joining non-motorway route that they would designate the new road as high-quality dual carriageway and block off the existing road from the M50. 13 km (8.1 miles) of this dual carriageway stretch became motorway on 28 August 2009.
The route continues through Balrath towards Slane, where a dangerous bridge brings the road through the town by the historic Hill of Slane, now home to the occasional rock festival. The N2 continues through Collon in County Louth. Just after Ardee, the N2 meets the N33, coming from the nearby M1 motorway, which most traffic coming from Dublin uses for N2 destinations north of Ardee. In County Monaghan, the N2 bypasses Carrickmacross to the east, along a bypass opened on 31 January 2005. This 9 km wide single carriageway has been named &quot;The Kavanagh Way&quot;, after Monaghan writer and poet Patrick Kavanagh. The route by-passes Castleblayney and Clontibret on the way to Monaghan. North of Monaghan town, the N12 diverges east to the border. The N2 continues north through Emyvale to reach the border at &quot;Moy Bridge&quot; directly south of Aughnacloy, County Tyrone. From here, the road becomes the A5 road to Omagh, Letterkenny and Derry.

== Upgrades ==
Projects completed on the N2 include a 16 km (10 miles) 2+1 bypass of Castleblayney, which opened on 5 November 2007 . A 3 km (1.9 miles) single carriageway bypass of Monaghan town to the east was opened on 25 September 2006 by Pat Gallagher, Junior Minister For Transport.

Previous planned projects along the N2 included a 4 km (2.5 miles) bypass of Ardee and a 6 km (3.7 miles) bypass of Slane. These projects have now been incorporated into a single project which extends from the end of the Ashbourne Bypass to north of Ardee (N2 Ashbourne to Ardee). The feasibility report for this scheme recommends a dual carriageway cross section. That section of the N2 from the end of the Castleblayney Bypass to the NI Border at Aughnacloy is also being studied (N2 Clontibret to NI Border).

== Discussion ==
Because the N2 contains narrow and steep-gradient sections in the environs of Slane, Collon and south of Ardee, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) recommends that hauliers heading from Dublin to Derry should instead use the M1 motorway from Dublin as far as its junction with the N33 road, then follow N33 to its junction with N2, north of Ardee.

There have been calls (by political parties in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) to upgrade the whole Dublin-Derry route to dual carriageway. This would entail upgrading both the N2 and also the A5 in Northern Ireland.

A 2007 Fianna Fáil election policy document on transport included a plan for a dual carriageway from Dublin to Letterkenny and Derry as one of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s promises if re-elected. Although the N2 was not included in Transport 21, and the Monaghan and Carrickmacross by-passes are single lane national primary roads, a feasibility report completed on the N2 Ashbourne to Ardee section recommended a dual carriageway cross section (including the Slane By-pass). Also, in order to tie in with the A5 Western Transport Corridor north of the border, work on the feasibility study for the N2 Clontibret to NI Border Scheme was commenced . As of 2024, this route has a defined corridor, and is progressing to the design phase. An upgrade of the section from Ardee to Castleblaney to dual carriageway has reached final design, but is suspended due to lack of funding.

In October 2006, the Irish government announced it was funding infrastructure to the value of €1 billion within Northern Ireland where such projects improved connectivity between parts of the Repbublic. One of the proposed projects to be funded was the upgrading of the A5 Derry–Omagh–Aughnacloy road to dual carriageway for a distance of . The Irish Department of Finance website confirmed on 22 March 2007 that £400 million had been set aside for Northern investment to include a dual carriageway to Derry and Donegal, although the A5 project itself was beset by delays and as of 2024 has still not commenced.

== M2 motorway ==


On 30 September 2008, it was announced that a 13 km (8.1 miles) section of the current N2 from Killshane to Ashbourne was under consideration for re-designation to motorway standard. Public consultation finished in December 2008.

On 14 July 2009, it was announced that the 13 km (8.1 miles) stretch had received ministerial approval to be re-designated. It became a motorway on 28 August 2009.

<text>Afro-Cuban jazz is the earliest form of Latin jazz. It mixes Afro-Cuban clave-based rhythms with jazz harmonies and techniques of improvisation. Afro-Cuban music has deep roots in African ritual and rhythm. The genre emerged in the early 1940s with the Cuban musicians Mario Bauzá and Frank Grillo &quot;Machito&quot; in the band Machito and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. In 1947, the collaborations of bebop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and percussionist Chano Pozo brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, such as the tumbadora and the bongo, into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban music, such as &quot;Manteca&quot; and &quot;Mangó Mangüé&quot;, were commonly referred to as &quot;Cubop&quot; for Cuban bebop.

During its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba. In the early 1970s, Kenny Dorham and his Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna, and later Irakere, brought Afro-Cuban jazz into the Cuban music scene, influencing styles such as songo.

==History==

===&quot;Spanish tinge&quot;—the Cuban influence in early jazz===
Although clave-based Afro-Cuban jazz did not appear until the mid-20th century, the Cuban influence was present at the birth of jazz. African-American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban musical motifs in the 19th century when the habanera gained international popularity. The habanera was the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African motif. The habanera rhythm (also known as &quot;congo&quot; or &quot;tango&quot;) can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat.

Musicians from Havana and New Orleans took the twice-daily ferry between both cities to perform, and the habanera took root. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre habanera &quot;reached the U.S. 20 years before the first rag was published&quot;. For more than a quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and jazz were forming, the habanera was a consistent part of African-American popular music. Early New Orleans jazz bands had habaneras in their repertoire, and the tresillo/habanera figure was a rhythmic staple of jazz at the turn of the 20th century. Comparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, Wynton Marsalis said that the tresillo is the New Orleans clave. &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; (1914) by W. C. Handy has a habanera/tresillo bass line. The first measures are shown below.

Handy noted a reaction to the habanera rhythm included in Will H. Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Maori&quot;: &quot;I observed that there was a sudden, proud and graceful reaction to the rhythm...White dancers, as I had observed them, took the number in stride. I began to suspect that there was something Negroid in that beat.&quot; After noting a similar reaction to the same rhythm in &quot;La Paloma&quot;, Handy included this rhythm in his &quot;St. Louis Blues,&quot; the instrumental copy of &quot;Memphis Blues,&quot; the chorus of &quot;Beale Street Blues,&quot; and other compositions.&quot;

Jelly Roll Morton considered the tresillo/habanera (which he called the Spanish tinge) to be an essential ingredient of jazz. Morton stated, &quot;Now in one of my earliest tunes, &#x27;New Orleans Blues&#x27;, you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can&#x27;t manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz—Morton (1938: Library of Congress Recording).&quot; An excerpt of &quot;New Orleans Blues&quot; is shown below. In the excerpt, the left hand plays the tresillo rhythm, while the right hand plays variations on cinquillo.

Although the origin of jazz syncopation may never be known, there&#x27;s evidence that the habanera/tresillo existed at its conception. Buddy Bolden, the first known jazz musician, is credited with creating the big four, a habanera-based pattern. The big four (below) was the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march. As the example below shows, the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm.

In &quot;Early Jazz: Its Roots and Musical Development&quot;, Gunther Schuller states,

The Cuban influence is evident in many pre-1940s jazz tunes, but rhythmically they are all based on single-celled motifs such as tresillo, and do not contain an overt two-celled, clave-based structure. &quot;Caravan&quot;, written by Juan Tizol and first performed in 1936, is an example of an early pre-Latin jazz composition. It is not clave-based. On the other hand, jazzy renditions of Don Azpiazú&#x27;s &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot; (&quot;El manicero&quot;) by Louis Armstrong (1930), Duke Ellington (1931), and Stan Kenton (1948), are all firmly in-clave since the 2-3 guajeo provides the primary counterpoint to the melody throughout the entire song.

===Mario Bauzá and Machito===
The consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first jazz piece to be based in-clave was &quot;Tanga&quot; (1943) composed by Cuban-born Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro-Cubans. &quot;Tanga&quot; began humbly as a spontaneous descarga (Cuban jam session) with jazz solos superimposed on top.

The right hand of the &quot;Tanga&quot; piano guajeo is in the style known as ponchando, a type of non-arpeggiated guajeo using block chords. The sequence of attack-points is emphasized, rather than a sequence of different pitches. As a form of accompaniment it can be played in a strictly repetitive fashion or as a varied motif akin to jazz comping.

The following example is in the style of a 1949 recording by Machito, with René Hernández on piano.

====Ten innovations by Machito&#x27;s Afro-Cubans====
Written by Bobby Sanabria, published on November 28, 2007 on a blog called latinjazz@yahoogroups
# The first band to make congas, bongo, and timbales the standard percussion in Afro-Cuban based dance music. The use of broken bell patterns by the bongocero in mambo horn sections, the increased rhythmic vocabulary of the conga drum and its function in a band setting, the increased importance of the timbales in setting up figures played by the horns and accenting them as a jazz drummer would do in a big band. e.g. &quot;Nagüe,&quot; also the first recorded example of all three percussion instruments playing as a section.
# The first band to explore jazz arranging techniques with Afro-Cuban rhythms on a consistent basis, giving it an identifiable sound. Cuban big band arranger Chico O&#x27;Farill stated, &quot;This was a new concept in interpreting Cuban music with as much (harmonic) richness as possible. You have to understand how important this was. It made every other band that came after, followers.&quot;
# The first band to explore modal harmony from a jazz arranging perspective through the recording of &quot;Tanga&quot;. Of note is the &#x27;sheet of sound&#x27; effect in the arrangement through the use of multiple layering.
# The first big band to explore, from an Afro-Cuban rhythmic perspective, large-scale extended compositional works. e.g. &quot;The Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite&quot; by Chico O&#x27;Farill.
# The first band to combine big band arranging techniques within an original composition with jazz oriented soloists using an Afro-Cuban based rhythm section, e.g. Gene Johnson – alto, Brew Moore – tenor, composition – &quot;Tanga&quot; (1943).
# The first multi-racial band in the United States.
# The first band in the United States to use the term &quot;Afro-Cuban&quot; in its name (Machito &amp; The Afro-Cubans), alluding to the West African roots of their music. This was an overlooked contribution by the orchestra to the burgeoning civil rights movement which compelled the Latin and African-American communities of New York to deal with their West African musical roots.
# The first Afro-Cuban dance band to explore clave conterpoint from an arranging standpoint. The ability to weave seamlessly from one side of the clave to the other without breaking its rhythmic integrity within the structure of a musical arrangement.
# Music director Mario Bauzá and lead vocalist Machito promoted a standard of excellence for subsequent band leaders, such as José Curbelo, Tito Puente, Marcelino Guerra, Tito Rodriguez, and Elmo Garcia. Although it could be argued that Xavier Cugat established such a standard much earlier with his orchestra at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (1931), the sound emulated by bandleaders in New York City was different from Cugat&#x27;s. Cugat performed for the high society of New York City, not the Latino community in East Harlem (El Barrio) and the South Bronx. Cugat&#x27;s music was one they may have heard on the radio, but this community had little access to it.
# The Machito Afro-Cubans provided a forum for progressive musical ideas, compositions, and arrangements. They explored the fusion of Afro Cuban music with jazz arranging and jazz-oriented soloists in a multiracial framework.

Bauzá developed the 3-2/2-3 clave concept and terminology. A chord progression can begin on either side of clave. When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3-2 clave. When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2-3 clave.

In North America, salsa and Latin jazz charts commonly represent clave in two measures of cut-time (2/2); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions.

When clave is written in two measures (above), changing from one clave sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures. Bauzá balanced Latin and jazz musicians in Machito&#x27;s band to realize his vision of Afro-Cuban jazz. He mastered both types of music, but it took time for him to teach the jazz musicians in Machito&#x27;s band about clave. When trumpeter Doc Cheatham joined the band, Machito fired him after two nights because he could not cope with clave.

===Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo===
Mario Bauzá introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to the Cuban conga drummer, dancer, composer, and choreographer Chano Pozo. The brief collaboration of Gillespie and Pozo produced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards.

&quot;Manteca&quot; (1947), co-written by Gillespie and Pozo, is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: &quot;If I&#x27;d let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would&#x27;ve been strictly Afro-Cuban, all the way. There wouldn&#x27;t have been a bridge... I ... thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge. But after eight bars I hadn&#x27;t resolved back to B-flat, so I had to keep on going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.&quot; It was the bridge that gave &quot;Manteca&quot; a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauzá&#x27;s modal &quot;Tanga&quot; of a few years earlier. Arrangements with a &quot;Latin&quot; A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many &quot;Latin tunes&quot; of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of &quot;Manteca&quot;, &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;, &quot;Tin Tin Deo,&quot; and &quot;On Green Dolphin Street.&quot;

Gillespie&#x27;s collaboration with Pozo brought African-based rhythms into bebop, a post-modernist art form. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, &quot;cu-bop&quot; as it was called, also drew more directly from Africa, rhythmically.

Early performances of &quot;Manteca&quot; reveal that despite their enthusiasm for collaborating, Gillespie and Pozo were not very familiar with each other&#x27;s music. The members of Gillespie&#x27;s band were unaccustomed to guajeos, overly swinging and accenting them in an atypical fashion. Thomas Owens observes: &quot;Once the theme ends and the improvisation begins, ... Gillespie and the full band continue the bebop mood, using swing eighths in spite of Pozo&#x27;s continuing even eighths, until the final A section of the theme returns. Complete assimilation of Afro-Cuban rhythms and improvisations on a harmonic ostinato was still a few years away for the beboppers in 1947.&quot; On a live 1948 recording of &quot;Manteca,&quot; someone is heard playing the 3-2 son clave pattern on claves throughout a good portion of this 2-3 song.

The rhythm of the melody of the A section is identical to a common mambo bell pattern:

===1940s –1970s===
In early 1947 Stan Kenton recorded &quot;Machito,&quot; written by his collaborator / arranger Pete Rugolo. Some consider the piece to be the first Afro-Cuban jazz recording by American jazz musicians. John Storm Roberts observes that the piece &quot;has no Latino instrumentalists on it, a lack of that is obvious; the crisp, fast montuno with which the piece opens is weighed down by not-so-adept drumming from Shelly Mann.&quot; Later, on 6 December of the same year, Kenton recorded an arrangement of the son &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot; with members of Machito&#x27;s rhythm section. Kenton continued to work with Afro-Cuban rhythms and musicians for another decade; the 1956 Kenton album &quot;Cuban Fire!&quot; was written as an Afro-Cuban suite by Johnny Richards.
Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaría first recorded his composition &quot;Afro Blue&quot; in 1959. &quot;Afro Blue&quot; was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) cross-rhythm, or hemiola.

The song begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of , or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats—6:4 (two cells of 3:2). The following example shows the original ostinato &quot;Afro Blue&quot; bass line. The slashed noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes), where you would normally tap your foot to &quot;keep time.&quot;

In the mid-1940s, the mambo craze originated with the recordings of Perez Prado, who included jazz elements, and ideas from Stravinsky in his arrangements.

Guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinato melodies), or guajeo fragments are commonly used motifs in Latin jazz melodies. For example, the A section of &quot;Sabor&quot; is a 2-3 onbeat/offbeat guajeo, minus some notes. The following excerpt is from a performance by Cal Tjader.

===1980s New York City===

Afro-Cuban jazz has been for most of its history a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. In the 1980s a generation of New York City musicians had come of age playing both salsa dance music and jazz.

In 1967 brothers Jerry and Andy González at the ages of 15 and 13 formed a Latin jazz quintet inspired by Cal Tjader&#x27;s group. with Jerry on congas and Andy on bass. During 1974–1976 they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri&#x27;s experimental salsa groups. Andy González recounts, &quot;We were into improvising... doing that thing Miles Davis was doing—playing themes and just improvising on the themes of songs, and we never stopped playing through the whole set.&quot;

While in Palmieri&#x27;s band, the González brothers started showing up in the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll. In 1974, the González brothers and Manny Oquendo founded the salsa band Libre and experimented with jazz and Afro-Cuban rhythms. Libre recorded Charlie Parker&#x27;s &quot;Donna Lee&quot; as a danzón, Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Tune Up&quot; as a conga de comparsa, and Freddie Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;Little Sunflower&quot; as a mambo. In the 1980s, Tito Puente began recording and performing Latin jazz. The González brothers worked with Puente as well as Dizzy Gillespie. McCoy Tyner hired the brothers when he played Afro-Cuban jazz. Other New York musicians included Bobby Sanabria, Steve Turre, Conrad Herwig, Hilton Ruiz, Chris Washburn, Ralph Irizarry, David Sánchez, and Dave Valentine. Latin jazz musicians in San Francisco included John Santos&#x27; Machete Ensemble, Rebeca Mauleón, Mark Levine, Omar Sosa, and Orestes Vilato.

Jan L. Hartong&#x27;s Nueva Manteca is based in The Hague, Netherlands, and Yilian Cañizares in Lausanne, Switzerland.

===The Cuban branch===
&quot;Jazz bands&quot; began forming in Cuba as early as the 1920s. These bands often included both Cuban popular music and popular North American jazz, and show tunes in their repertoires. Despite this musical versatility, the movement of blending Afro-Cuban rhythms with jazz was not strong in Cuba itself for decades. As Leonardo Acosta observes: &quot;Afro-Cuban jazz developed simultaneously in New York and Havana, with the difference that in Cuba it was a silent and almost natural process, practically imperceptible&quot;.Cuba&#x27;s contribution to the genre came relatively late, beginning with the band Irakere.

&quot;Chékere-son&quot; (1976) introduced a style of &quot;Cubanized&quot; bebop-flavored horn lines, that departed from the more &quot;angular&quot; guajeo-based lines typical of Cuban popular music.

The horn line style introduced in &quot;Chékere-son&quot; is heard today in Afro-Cuban jazz, and the contemporary popular dance genre known as timba. Another important Irakere contribution is their use of batá and other Afro-Cuban folkloric drums. &quot;Bacalao con pan&quot; is the first song recorded by Irakere to use batá. The tune combines the folkloric drums, jazzy dance music, and distorted electric guitar with wah-wah pedal.

According to Raúl A. Fernández, the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna members would not have been allowed by the orquesta to record the unconventional song. The musicians travelled to Santiago to record it. &quot;Somehow the tune made it from Santiago to radio stations in Havana where it became a hit; Irakere was formally organized a little bit later&quot;.

Several of the founding members did not always appreciate Irakere&#x27;s fusion of jazz and Afro-Cuban elements. They saw the Cuban folk elements as a type of nationalistic &quot;fig leaf&quot;, cover for their true love—jazz. They were obsessed with jazz. Cuba&#x27;s Ministry of Culture is said to have viewed jazz as the music of &quot;imperialist America.&quot; Pablo Menéndez, founder of Mezcla, recalls: &quot;Irakere were jazz musicians who played stuff like &#x27;Bacalao con pan&#x27; with a bit of a tongue in cheek attitude—&#x27;for the masses.&#x27; I remember Paquito d&#x27;Rivera thought it was pretty funny stuff (as opposed to &#x27;serious&#x27; stuff)&quot; (2011: web). In spite of the ambivalence by some members towards Irakere&#x27;s Afro-Cuban folkloric/jazz fusion, their experiments changed Cuban popular music, Latin jazz, and salsa.

Another important Cuban jazz musician is pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba, whose innovative jazz guajeos revolutionized Cuban-style piano in the 1980s. Like the musicians of his generation who founded the timba era, Rubalcaba is a product of the Cuban music education system. He studied both piano and drums. Rubalcaba began his classical musical training at Manuel Saumell Conservatory at age 9, where he had to choose piano; he moved up to &quot;middle-school&quot; at Amadeo Roldan Conservatory, and finally earned his degree in music composition from Havana&#x27;s Institute of Fine Arts in 1983. By that time he was already playing in clubs and music halls in Havana.

Many Cuban jazz bands, such as the saxophonist Tony Martinez&#x27;s group, perform at a level few non-Cubans can match rhythmically. The clave matrix offers infinite possibilities for rhythmic textures in jazz. The Cuban-born drummer Dafnis Prieto in particular, has been a trailblazer in expanding the parameters of clave experimentation. Afro-Cuban singer Daymé Arocena has been described as a &quot;cross between Celia Cruz and Aretha Franklin&quot;.

==Clave license==
More than a half century ago, Mario Bauzá developed arranging in-clave to an art. Another name for clave is guide-pattern, and that is how Bauzá related to it. He taught Tito Puente, and Puente&#x27;s arrangers learned from him.

The techniques were passed down from one generation to the next. Many educated Cuban musicians reject the idea of 3-2/2-3 clave. Dafnis Prieto and Alain Pérez reject the concept. Many younger musicians reject the concept of &quot;clave rules&quot;. Pérez states, &quot;I just don&#x27;t treat the clave as a study or a profound analysis conceived around where it overlaps and where it comes in. I didn&#x27;t learn it in that way&quot;.

Bobby Sanabria laments the pervasiveness of this attitude in Cuba. &quot;The lack of clave consciousness in Cuba is starting to be felt more and more where the rhythmic equilibrium established by the clave direction is being sacrificed due to lack of knowledge in how to work with it from an arranging standpoint by young arrangers especially in the timba movement&quot; Perhaps Juan Formell, founder of Los Van Van, summed up this contemporary Cuban clave attitude best. &quot;We Cubans like to think we have &#x27;clave license&#x27;...and we don&#x27;t feel obsessed about the clave as many others do&quot;.

<text>The Julier Pass (Romansh: &quot;Pass dal Güglia&quot;, German: &quot;Julierpass&quot;, Italian &quot;Passo del Giulia&quot;) (elev. 2284 m) is a mountain pass in the Albula Alps of Switzerland. It connects the Engadin valley with central Graubünden. At its summit, the pass crosses the drainage divide between the basins of the rivers Rhine and Danube. 

The Julier Pass lies between the towns of Bivio to the west and Silvaplana to the east. It is part of the Swiss N29 national road, but does not require a vignette (road tax sticker). The pass was heavily used in the Roman era and contains the most artifacts of Roman roads of any location in Graubünden. The modern road was built between 1820 and 1828. Between 1935 and 1940, the Julier Pass became the first Swiss alpine road paved with asphalt. 

The Julier Pass is the most important northern entrance to the Engadin valley and one of three such paved road passes, the others being the Albula Pass and the Flüela Pass.

== Geography and conditions ==
The highest point of the Julier Pass is 2284 meters above sea level. The Julier Pass lies south of Piz Bardella, Piz Lagrev, and Piz Julier, and north of Piz da las Coluonnas and Piz Polaschin. A few metres south of the summit is a small lake, Lej da las Culuonnas.

The two-lane road over the Julier Pass is generally open to trucks with four-wheel drive even when covered with snow, though it is often closed to all traffic in heavy snow. Cars are required to have snow tires in the winter, and snow chains may be required, depending on the conditions. 

Originally a cantonal road, the Julier Pass was adopted into the Swiss federal highway system on 1 January 2020 as part of the new N29 from Thusis via Tiefencastel to Silvaplana. The N29 highway is long and connects to the N13 highway at Thusis-Süd. Previously, the stretch from Thusis to Tiefencastle was designated as the H417 main road and the stretch from Tiefencastel to Silvaplana was the H3a main road. Since the N29 is a 3rd class national road, vehicles using it are not required to display a vignette. 

The Julier Pass was home to a temporary theater tower from 31 July 2017 to 31 August 2023. The 30-meter-high wooden tower was built by Nova Fundaziun Origen, a cultural foundation started in 2005. The theater tower cost and was ceremonially opened by Federal Councillor Alain Berset. As of 2023, Origen is planning a permanent replacement costing .

== History ==

The Julier Pass was in regular use during the Bronze and Iron Ages. It saw heavy traffic in the Roman era, evidenced by the countless coins and remains of Roman roads discovered in the region; it has the most artifacts of the Roman roads of any location in the canton. Two monumental soapstone columns flank the modern pass road at its summit; excavations in the 1930s revealed that the columns were part of a Roman sanctuary.

Historically, the Julier Pass competed with the shorter but steeper Septimer Pass. Together, the two passes made up the (), which continued northwards via Lenzerheide to Chur, and southwards via the Maloja Pass. During the Roman era, the Julier and Septimer Passes were roads suitable for two-wheeled carts, the largest vehicles able to negotiate the steep slopes, and it is theorized that carts were sent over the Julier Pass when loaded and over the Septimer Pass when empty. At the time, the less-developed Splügen Pass was only suitable for pack animals. 

The Julier Pass lost importance in 1387, when a small road over the Septimer Pass was built. In 1473, the path through the Viamala was expanded, and the was no longer preferred for transalpine travel. The Viamala was part of the (), which ran via the Splügen Pass and San Bernardino Pass. Thus, in the High and Late Middle Ages, the Julier Pass was mainly used to provide access to the upper Engadin, Bernina Pass, and Fuorn Pass. This shift led the Bishop of Chur, who controlled the , to acquire Thusis and Heinzenberg from the Counts of Werdenberg, giving him control of the and a monopoly over the passes of the Three Leagues. 

In the first millennium, the passes of Graubünden were controlled by a patchwork of feudal lords. By the second millennium, transport over the passes was operated by six cooperatives called or . The were commercial enterprises which transported goods for a fee. They were also responsible for maintaining the passes and roads and would work with local towns and governments to improve road infrastructure. The , as associations of teamsters (), also functioned similarly to guilds, with 3500 members by the late 18th century. Goods had to be offloaded and re-loaded onto new carts or pack animals for each that transported them, with the result that goods moving from Chur to Chiavenna or Bellinzona had to be off- and re-loaded no less than six times. Despite this inefficiency, the of the were the preferred transalpine route, ahead of the Gotthard and Brenner, except in times of war, until they were overtaken by the Brenner Pass in the early 19th century. By that point, large, efficient horse-drawn vehicles could cross the Brenner, allowing a single teamster to transport 30 (3000 pounds) of goods. In Graubünden, road conditions were still so poor that only pack animals or two-wheeled carts could cross the passes.

=== Roadbuilding ===

The 1803 Act of Mediation turned the Three Leagues into the Swiss canton of Graubünden, which returned economic stability to the region after the chaos of the Italian and Swiss expedition. By this point, the Brenner Pass had overtaken Graubünden as the most efficient transalpine route, largely due to better road infrastructure. The poor roads in Graubünden were especially troublesome when they prevented the northward transport of large amounts of grain during the Year Without a Summer (1816) and subsequent years of famine; most of the grain purchased abroad spoiled in Italian harbors or at the foot of the Alps. This resulted in strong support in Graubünden for building roads across the Alpine passes. 

The first two paved roads () over the alpine passes built in Graubünden were along the San Bernardino and Splügen Passes of the . In 1816, a six-meter-wide road along the 100-kilometer-long San Bernardino route was plotted by Ticino State Councillor within a few days. Although supported by Ticino and the Kingdom of Sardinia, the project was difficult to finance and was opposed by cantons along the Gotthard route and Austria, which controlled Lombardy. Eventually, with funding from the merchants of Chur, the , and the municipalities along the route, construction of the San Bernardino commercial road began on 14 September 1818 and was completed by the summer of 1823. In the meantime, Lombardy constructed a four-meter-wide road over the Splügen Pass, which was completed by the summer of 1822. 

Between 1820 and 1828, the canton of Graubünden expanded the road from Chur to Castasegna via the Julier and Maloja Passes into a five-meter-wide commercial road, at a cost of 1.24 million Francs. The Julier Pass was chosen over the Septimer for its gentler slope, lower avalanche risk, and access to the Engadin valley. The construction of this new road proved prescient when massive flooding of the Hinterrhein in 1834 obstructed the to San Bernardino at 72 locations and destroyed 24 bridges. The new road allowed the displaced transalpine traffic to be rerouted over the unaffected Julier Pass without issue. From 1835 onward, the chief engineer of the canton of Graubünden, Richard La Nicca, worked to improve the , including the Julier Pass. La Nicca was self-taught and mentored by Pocobelli, who together came to define this period of construction. The many bridges La Nicca designed have been praised for their unique and aesthetic design; many have lasted to the present day. 

In the second half of the 19th century, the Julier Pass was most notable for providing access to the spa towns of the upper Engadin, while transalpine traffic preferred the Splügen route or new alpine railways. Proposed plans for a Julier railway were never realized and the 1903 opening of the Albula railway line through the Albula Tunnel all but ended road traffic over the Julier Pass. 

In 1923, the Swiss federal government forced Graubünden to open a through road for automobiles, and the canton chose the Julier route for this role. The Julier route was again expanded and upgraded between 1935 and 1940, becoming the first Swiss alpine road with an asphalt surface. Today, the Julier Pass is the most important northern entrance to the Engadin valley. Around 3,000 vehicles cross the Julier Pass every day.

<text>The Lagunas de Ruidera are a group of small lakes in the Campo de Montiel, Castilla-La Mancha, between Albacete Province, and Ciudad Real Province, Spain. Most of the lakes are interconnected and their total water amount may reach 23.06 hm3, which is considerable by the standards of other lakes in the Iberian Peninsula.

The largest lakes are Laguna Colgada and Laguna del Rey. The area near the lakes is a tourist site, with small hotels, restaurants, camping sites and private villas, located mostly in or around Ruidera town. The area can be reached from Ossa de Montiel or Villahermosa.

==List of lakes==
There are now 15 small lakes in the group:

===Albacete Province===
* Laguna Colgada
* Laguna Batana
* Laguna Santos Morcillo
* Laguna Salvadora
* Laguna Lengua
* Laguna Redondilla 
* Laguna de San Pedro
* Laguna Tinaja
* Laguna Tomilla
* Laguna Conceja
* Laguna Taza. This lake was drained in order to build a camping site

===Ciudad Real Province===
*Laguna Cenagosa
*Laguna Coladilla
*Laguna Cueva Morenilla
*Laguna del Rey
*Laguna Blanca

==Ecology==
There are a variety of birds in the lake shores: ducks, like the red-crested pochard, common pochard, mallard and tufted duck, as well as the Eurasian coot, common moorhen, great reed warbler, bearded reedling, purple heron, little bittern and egrets.
In the waters of the lakes there are also endemic Iberian fishes like the &quot;Rutilus lemmingii&quot;, &quot;Luciobarbus guiraonis&quot;, Iberian barbel, &quot;Luciobarbus microcephalus&quot;, &quot;Squalius pyrenaicus&quot;, as well as introduced species, like the common carp, northern pike, largemouth bass and &quot;Gambusia holbrooki&quot;. The &quot;Procambarus clarkii&quot; is an introduced species of crayfish that has caused great damage to the local aquatic fauna.
Among the amphibians, the European tree frog, Mediterranean tree frog and the southern marbled newt are present along the shores of the lakes.

The protected area of the Lagunas de Ruidera Natural Park includes not only the lakes but also the tributary valley of San Pedro.
UNESCO has included the natural park within the biosphere reserve Mancha Húmeda.

The natural park acts as a buffer zone to the core area of the biosphere reserve, the Tablas de Daimiel wetlands.

<text>F-Secure Corporation is a global cyber security and privacy company, which has its headquarters in Helsinki, Finland.

The company has offices in Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States, with a presence in more than 100 countries, and Security Lab operations in Helsinki and in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

F-Secure develops and sells antivirus, VPN, password management, and other consumer cyber security products and services for computers, mobile devices, smart TVs and internet of things devices. The company also offers several free-to-use tools on its website. 

In 2022, F-Secure announced a demerger of its corporate and consumer businesses: the corporate business branch was renamed to WithSecure.

==History==
F-Secure was first established under the name Data Fellows by Petri Allas and Risto Siilasmaa on May 16, 1988. Data Fellows trained computer users and built customized databases. Three years later, the company launched its first major software project and developed the first heuristic scanner for antivirus products. F-Secure’s first antivirus product for Windows PCs was launched in 1994. Data Fellows became F-Secure in 1999. F-Secure was the first company that developed an anti-rootkit technology called BlackLight in 2005.

In June 2015, F-Secure expanded into the enterprise market by acquiring nSense, a Danish company that specialized in security consultation and vulnerability assessment. The purchase followed of Inverse Path, a privately owned Italian security consultancy with experience in avionics, automotive, and industrial control sectors.

F-Secure Client Security received the AV-TEST Best Protection award for the fifth time in 2016.

In June 2018, F-Secure acquired security company MWR InfoSecurity for £80 million ($106 million). F-Secure gained the MWR consulting business (now F-Secure Consulting), its threat hunting product Countercept (now F-Secure Managed Detection and Response), and its suite of phishing protection services, phishd. 

On February 17, 2022, F-Secure announced a demerger of its corporate and consumer businesses. In conjunction with the demerger, the company was renamed as WithSecure Corporation. The consumer security business was to be transferred into a new independent company and continue using the name F-Secure Corporation. The demerger came into effect July 1, 2022, when F-Secure was listed on Nasdaq Helsinki and the corporate business was completely separated from the company.

==Academia==
Around 2008, in co-operation with Aalto University School of Science and Technology, F-Secure ran a one-semester course for future virus analysts, with some material available online.

==Controversies==
In 2001, after media coverage of the Magic Lantern spyware and claims by some AV vendors to purposely leave a backdoor for it in their products, F-Secure announced their policy on detecting these spying programs:

&quot;F-Secure Corporation would like to make known that we will not leave such backdoors to our F-Secure Anti-Virus products, regardless of the source of such tools. We have to draw a line with every sample we get regarding whether to detect it or not. This decision-making is influenced only by technical factors, and nothing else, but within the applicable laws and regulations, in our case meaning EU laws.&quot;

&quot;We will also be adding detection of any program we see that might be used for terrorist activity or to benefit organized crime. We would like to state this for the record, as we have received queries regarding whether we would have the guts to detect something obviously made by a known violent mafia or terrorist organization. Yes we would.&quot;

<doc id="1107999" wikidata="Q5525682" url="?curid=1107999" title="Gary O'Donnell (Australian footballer)">
<text>Gary O&#x27;Donnell (born 12 May 1965) is a former Australian rules footballer who played 243 games for the Essendon Football Club between 1987 and 1998. He previously served as the assistant coach in the role Offensive Strategy Coach at the Brisbane Lions.

==Family==
O&#x27;Donnell is the son of Bev and Graeme O&#x27;Donnell. He is a member of a prominent Australian rules football family. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Eileen O&#x27;Donnell (née Rankin) was the daughter of Teddy Rankin and the sister of Bert, Cliff and Doug Rankin. All four were prominent players with Geelong. His father were also a notable player. His sister, Shelley O&#x27;Donnell, is a former Australia netball international.

==Playing career==
O’Donnell was a junior teammate of Paul Salmon at North Ringwood where they won 4 premierships in succession from 1977 up to the under 16s in 1980. Prior to the introduction of the player draft, Ringwood was part of Essendon&#x27;s recruitment zone.

===Essendon Football Club===
O’Donnell&#x27;s start at VFL football didn&#x27;t come easy: he played nearly 50 reserve grade matches before being selected to make his debut in the last game of the 1987 season. From there he held down a steady place in the side, first as a defender, then later developing into a tagging midfielder who was capable of getting the football as well as keeping an opposition player quiet. At his peak, O&#x27;Donnell was regarded as one of the most consistent players in the competition, with commentators often stating that he &quot;never plays a bad game&quot;.

O&#x27;Donnell played 243 games from 1987 to 1998, leading the Bombers as captain for two seasons in a decorated career in the red and black. Known as &#x27;Mr Reliable&#x27;, he was a vital part of Essendon&#x27;s 1993 premiership side, a year which also saw him win the Crichton Medal as the Bombers&#x27; best and fairest.

Underlining this consistency is his record in the club best-and-fairest: O&#x27;Donnell finished in the top three six years in a row, winning it in 1993, a premiership year for the Bombers. He also won the Michael Tuck Medal in 1994 as the best player in the pre-season grand final. Additionally, O&#x27;Donnell represented Victoria nine times in state of origin football.

O&#x27;Donnell was always regarded as one of the most astute thinkers in the game, and was rewarded with the captaincy for the 1996 and 1997 seasons.

In 2025, O&#x27;Donnell was named at Number 19 in Don The Stat&#x27;s Top 100 Essendon Players Since 1980.

==Coaching career==
===Brisbane Lions===
He reputation was further enhanced when after his retirement from his playing career, he took up an assistant coaching role with the Brisbane Lions in 1999 under senior coach Leigh Matthews. His tactical insight was a key part of the Lions&#x27; rise up the ladder, culminating in three premierships from 2001 to 2003.

===Essendon Football Club===
After Brisbane&#x27;s grand final loss in 2004, Gary O&#x27;Donnell announced that he would be returning to Essendon in 2005 as an assistant coach under senior coach Kevin Sheedy. On 22 July 2006, in Round 16, 2006, O&#x27;Donnell coached Essendon as caretaker interim senior coach for one game due to the absence of regular senior coach Kevin Sheedy, who injured his shoulder in a collision with defender Dean Solomon at training. Essendon drew with long-time rivals Carlton to end its then-record 14-match losing streak dating back to round two.

Some people had speculated that O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s return to Essendon indicated that he was the preferred replacement for Sheedy upon the latter&#x27;s retirement, but O&#x27;Donnell denied this, and on 27 September 2007 it was announced that Matthew Knights would be Sheedy&#x27;s successor. O&#x27;Donnell remained as an assistant coach at Essendon Football Club until the end of the 2010 season.

===Return to Brisbane Lions===
In October 2010, O&#x27;Donnell returned to the Brisbane Lions as an assistant coach under senior coach Michael Voss. O&#x27;Donnell left the Brisbane Lions at the end of the 2016 season.
