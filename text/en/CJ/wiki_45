<text>The marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata) is a species of tortoise in the family Testudinidae. The species is endemic to Greece, Italy, and the Balkans in Southern Europe. It is the largest European tortoise. The marginated tortoise is herbivorous, and brumates for the winter. 

==Taxonomy==

The marginated tortoise was formally described by German naturalist Johann David Schoepff in 1789; its specific epithet &quot;marginata&quot; is a straightforward derivation from the Latin term for &#x27;marginated&#x27;.

The nominate subspecies is the Greek marginated tortoise, &quot;Testudo marginata marginata&quot;. Three additional subspecies of marginated tortoises have been named:

The Sardinian marginated tortoise (&quot;T. m. sarda&quot;) is the name usually used to separate the population on the island of Sardinia. These tortoises have less strongly bent tiles in the posterior of their carapaces, and the posterior of the carapace is almost smooth compared with the saw-like &quot;T. m. marginata&quot;. Clearly distinct according to morphology and entirely allopatric, it cannot be distinguished by mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and nDNA ISSR sequence analysis. Lineage sorting has not occurred to a considerable degree; consequently, the more geographically isolated Sardinian population is presumably of quite recent origin.

Indeed, it appears to derive from a deliberate introduction by humans. Though it is not clear whether this occurred in prehistoric times or more recently, this might be resolved by dating subfossil remains. Sequence evolution at least in mtDNA is known to proceed much more slowly in some turtles and tortoises than in others; the rate of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene in &quot;Testudo&quot; is probably a rather low 1.0–1.6% per million years (as this fits best the paleobiogeographical situation), limiting the resolution provided by molecular systematics.

An extinct subspecies described as &quot;T. m. cretensis&quot; persisted on Crete before the end of the last ice age, presumably larger than mainland tortoises. However, numerous additional fossils have since refuted the validity of this subspecies.

A population of small and light-colored marginated tortoises exists on the southwestern coast of the Peloponnesus, between Kalamata and south of Stoupa. The so-called &quot;dwarf marginated tortoise&quot; was described as a new species &quot;Testudo weissingeri&quot;, but it is not recognizably distinct phylogenetically. Unlike the Sardinian population, it occupies an extremely restricted range with very arid habitat, and its apomorphies seem related to this. Considering ice age-associated climate and sea level changes, this population is probably not older than a few thousand years; as it is not geographically isolated, it should be considered a local form, and not even a subspecies &quot;T. m. weissingeri&quot;. Notably, a similar situation is found in Hermann&#x27;s tortoises living in the same region.

&quot;Testudo marginata&quot; is also closely related to the Greek or common tortoise (&quot;Testudo graeca&quot;). Both have very similar bodily characteristics—oblong carapaces, large scales on the front legs, large coverings for the head and cone-like scales on the upper thighs, undivided tail coverings, moveable stomach plates, and lack of tail spikes. Presumably, &quot;Testudo marginata&quot; diverged from ancestral &quot;Testudo graeca&quot; as a population more suited for life in the mountainous regions. Evidence in favor of this is the wide geographical region and the extremely large number of subspecies of &quot;Testudo graeca&quot;, including a subspecies in Turkey with strongly bent carapace tiles, like the marginated tortoise. &quot;Testudo marginata&quot; on the other hand, despite the two subspecies, presents a much more unified appearance, which points toward an earlier appearance in evolutionary history. In captivity, the two species often cross-breed, but this should be avoided.

According to the 2005 DNA sequence data, these species do not seem to hybridize to a notable extent in the wild, though they are obviously very close relatives, and as evidenced by morphology, some allele flow still occurs, but slowly. The Egyptian tortoise appears to represent a lineage that diverged from the same ancestral stock southwards into northeastern Africa around the same time as the marginated tortoise&#x27;s ancestors diverged in Greece. These two are actually more similar to each other than to &quot;T. graeca&quot; regarding DNA sequence data, but considering biogeography, this is either due to (rather unlikely) dispersal across the Mediterranean, or the supposed &quot;clade&quot; is invalid and the similarity due to convergent evolution.

==Description==
The marginated tortoise is the largest European tortoise, reaching a weight of up to and a length of . Its shell is oblong and has a notable thickness around the middle of the body. The posterior end of the shell has a saw-like formation, flanged outward like a bell. The carapace of an adult specimen is almost completely black, with yellow highlights. The ventral shell is lighter-coloured and has pairs of triangular markings with the points facing the rear of the animal. The front sides of the limbs are covered with large scales. In an old female specimen, the rear flaps of the underside of her plastron is somewhat moveable. The tail is notable for a lengthwise marking and for an undivided carapace over the tail. The male has a longer tail, which is thicker at the base than the female&#x27;s. The underside is more strongly indented. Males are also often larger than the females. The females lay their hard-shelled spherical eggs in the soil in May and June.

==Distribution and habitat==

The natural range of the marginated tortoise is southern Greece, from the Peloponnesus to Mount Olympus. They are also found in isolated zones of the Balkans and Italy, and northeastern Sardinia.

The marginated tortoise lives in more mountainous regions than Hermann&#x27;s tortoise. It can be found in elevations as high as . The black color of the carapace is helpful for survival in this environment, as it allows the tortoise to absorb a great deal of heat in a short time, helping it maintain its body temperature. Early in the morning, marginated tortoises bask in the sun to raise their body temperature, and then search for food. After feeding, the tortoises return to their shelters in the hot midday hours, leaving them again in the late afternoon.

==Behaviour==
Marginated tortoises are fairly calm and relaxed, although they can be somewhat territorial in the wild. They have a controlled temper and are generally slow to anger. If they are not given the proper diet in captivity, however, they will become rather aggressive and might mistakenly attack if they feel threatened.

===Diet===
Marginated tortoises are herbivorous, their diets consisting primarily of plants from their native Mediterranean region. 

===Reproduction===
Immediately after waking from brumation, the mating instinct starts up. The males follow the females with great interest, encircling them, biting them on the limbs, ramming them, and trying to mount them. During copulation, the male opens his mouth, showing his red tongue and making loud cries. The tone of the copulation cry is almost sobbing with long, deep tones, in contrast to &quot;T. hermanni&quot;, which uses a much higher-toned, peeping noise.

During mating, the female stands still and holds her head to the side, looking up to see the opened mouth of the male. The red tongue apparently serves a signalling function. The female moves her head from left to right in the same rhythm as the male&#x27;s cries.

Afterwards, the female seeks out an adequate location to lay her eggs. Once such a place is found, the female stands still, propping both front legs firmly against the ground. Then she digs out a hole with her hind legs, alternating between left and right, beginning with simply scratching the ground but eventually moving large quantities of soil which are piled up beside the hole. The depth of the hole is determined by the length of her hind legs. If the ground is too hard to dig, the female releases water from her anal gland to soften it.

Once the hole is dug, egg-laying begins. Each egg is gently rolled back into the hole. After the last egg, the female immediately begins refilling the hole, again using her hind legs. Finally, she stamps the opening closed with her feet so that the ground regains its natural hardness. Larger animals may lay eggs as many as three times per summer, with about 15 eggs per clutch.

The incubation period averages about 100 days under natural conditions, which is relatively short among tortoises. Many tropical tortoises have incubation periods of up to 200 days. The relatively short time is an adaptation to the subtropical Mediterranean climate, where the summers are not as long. In an incubator, this time is notably shorter: with an incubation temperature of the eggs will begin hatching after 60 days.

Unlike bird eggs, the yolk and albumen of reptile eggs are not separated by a membrane. After a few days, the heavy yolk components sink to the bottom of the egg. On top of this floats the embryonal disk, surrounded by albumen, so the tortoise eggs cannot be turned after the yolk settles without damaging or killing the embryo.

It is possible to see with the naked eye if the eggs are developing healthily. Freshly laid eggs have a gray-white color. Shortly thereafter, a bright white spot forms on the uppermost point of the egg. This spot gradually grows until the entire egg is bright white.

After the embryo has developed fully in the egg, the young animal breaks the shell with its egg tooth from inside, creates a small opening, and for the first time fills its lungs with air. Afterwards, it pulls back into the egg and works on the shell with its beak until it opens completely. In nature, the animal remains below ground for the first two weeks, where it is safe from predators, yet is still able to grow, as it is nourished by the yolk sac. The young animals lead cautious and secretive lives, normally remaining in the shade. They avoid full sunlight because of the great danger of overheating.

Marginated tortoises grow very rapidly. In an ideal biotope, or with good handling, they gain yearly. This quick rate of growth lasts throughout their youth. After the 20th year of life, further growth is minimal. They may live between 100 and 140 years, according to the best estimates of scientists.

<doc id="1095092" wikidata="Q687956" url="?curid=1095092" title="David Marshall (Singaporean politician)">
<text>David Saul Marshall (né Mashal; 12 March 1908 – 12 December 1995) was a Singaporean barrister and statesman who served as the inaugural Chief Minister of Singapore from 1955 to 1956. He resigned after just over a year at the helm after his delegation to London regarding negotiations for complete home rule and eventual independence of Singapore was initially rejected by the British. However, Marshall was nevertheless instrumental in forging the idea of sovereignty as well as in subsequent negotiations that led to its eventual self-governance from the United Kingdom in 1959.

While Marshall had a privileged upbringing, he was a leftist nationalist who aspired self-determination of the former British Crown colony—having founded the Labour Front and the Workers&#x27; Party. From 1963 onward, Marshall would renounce partisan politics and become an independent politician for the rest of his life. Singapore would eventually gain its complete independence in 1965 as a sovereign country – his foremost political goal coming into fruition.

In 1978, Marshall became a diplomat and was Singapore&#x27;s inaugural ambassador to various countries, including France, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland. During this time, Marshall defended Singapore&#x27;s interests abroad, despite his old political opponent and fellow barrister Lee Kuan Yew, under his People&#x27;s Action Party, concurrently in government with Lee as prime minister. Nevertheless, he publicly maintained constructive criticism of some domestic policies that he had disagreed with. Marshall retired in 1993, and died two years later in 1995, at the age of 87.

==Early life==
Marshall was born in Singapore on 12 March 1908, to Baghdadi Jewish parents Saul Nassim Mashal and Flora Ezekiel Kahn, who had immigrated to Singapore from Baghdad, which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire, where they ran a business. His family name was originally Mashal, which was later anglicised as Marshall in 1920. He had at least six siblings. Marshall received a strict Orthodox Jewish upbringing. 

===Education===
Marshall attended Saint Joseph&#x27;s Institution, Saint Andrew&#x27;s School and Raffles Institution. Marshall suffered from various illnesses as a teenager, such as malaria and tuberculosis. His initial goal of being a Queen&#x27;s Scholar for a medical degree never came when he fell ill and collapsed before the final examinations. He then went to Belgium to study textile manufacturing. Upon his return, he joined the textile industry and later worked as a French language teacher and translator. He then decided to pursue a law career in London, graduating from the University of London.

==Legal career and war service ==
Upon graduation, Marshall was called to the Bar from the Middle Temple in 1937 before returning to Singapore to commence a legal career.

In 1938, following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Marshall volunteered for military service with a British reserve unit, the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force. He was assigned to &quot;B&quot; Company, 1st Battalion (1SSVF)—a company composed mostly of continental European expatriates. He was detained briefly by military police after objecting to the fact that he and other volunteers classified as &quot;Asian&quot; were paid at half the rate collected by &quot;European&quot; members of the SSVF.

In February 1942, he saw action against the Imperial Japanese Army, in the Holland Road area, during the last few days of the Battle of Singapore. Marshall became a prisoner-of-war (POW) following the British surrender. He was initially interned in Changi Prison before being sent to a forced labour camp in Japan.

Reflecting later on his experience as a POW, Marshall commented:
Most of Marshall&#x27;s immediate family had emigrated to Australia before the war began. After the war ended Marshall spent time with his family in Australia, before returning to Singapore in 1946.

He became a successful and prominent criminal lawyer. Known for his sharp eloquence and imposing stance, Marshall claimed that he had secured 99 acquittals out of 100 cases he defended for murder during Singapore&#x27;s period of having trial by jury. When Lee Kuan Yew later abolished Singapore&#x27;s jury system (1969), he cited Marshall&#x27;s record as an illustration of its &quot;inadequacy&quot;.
==Political career==
===Chief Minister and MP===
In April 1955, Marshall led the left-wing Labour Front to a narrow victory in Singapore&#x27;s first Legislative Assembly elections. He formed a minority government and became Chief Minister. He resigned in April 1956 after a failed delegation to London to negotiate for complete self-rule.

After resigning, Marshall visited China for two months at the invitation of Zhou Enlai, the Chinese Premier. Contacted by a representative of a group of over 400 Russian Jews who were being refused exit from Shanghai by the Chinese authorities, Marshall spoke with Zhou and managed to have them released.

After returning from China, Marshall stayed on the backbenches before quitting the Labour Front and as a member of the Legislative Assembly in 1957. On 7 November 1957, he founded the Workers&#x27; Party of Singapore (WP), which has remained one of the major political parties in Singapore, just after the PAP.

Marshall lost his seat in Cairnhill Single Member Constituency to Lim Yew Hock, the Chief Minister, in the 1959 general election as a WP candidate, but won in Anson Single Member Constituency in the 1961 by-election. He resigned from the Workers&#x27; Party in January 1963 after a spat with some members of the party. 

After losing his seat again in the 1963 general election as an independent candidate, he decided to return to practice law but would remain active in politics, offering his opinions and viewpoints.

===Diplomat===
From 1978 to 1993, at the invitation of Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam, Marshall served as Singapore&#x27;s first ambassador to France, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland. As ambassador, Marshall always defended Singapore&#x27;s interests, despite his differences with Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s government. He retired from the diplomatic corps in 1993 after 15 years of service.

===Views on Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP===
While Marshall consistently praised Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP government for developing Singapore along with its economic prosperity, he also condemned the government for limiting freedom of speech and public freedoms. &quot;We should keep in mind the horrors of [China&#x27;s] Cultural Revolution, brought about by the cult of subservience to authority and primacy of society over the individual before we point the accusing finger at those who believe that respect for the individual is the basis of human civilisation&quot;, he said.

==Personal life==
Marshall married Jean Mary Gray in 1961, an Englishwoman. Jean was born on 13 April 1926 in Kent, South East England, and came to Singapore in 1953 to take up a post with the Singapore Red Cross Society as a medical social worker. They had four children and six grandchildren. Marshall died in 1995 of lung cancer. He was 87.

Jean Marshall died in Singapore on 29 March 2021, at age 94.

He was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1978.

== Legacy ==
Marshall has been considered by some Singaporeans as being one of the founding fathers of Singapore. A life-size cutout of him is present at the National Museum of Singapore&#x27;s Singapore History Gallery, along with some of his favourite iconic smoking pipes that were donated to the museum by his wife which accompanied him wherever he went, as well as other items such as his campaign cards.

He is also well-regarded by lawyers in Singapore. In recognition of his impeccable service, he was appointed as an Honorary Member and Fellow of the Academy of Law in 1992 by the Singapore Academy of Law (SAL), and the David Marshall Professorship in Law was set up in 1995 by the National University of Singapore (NUS). In 2007, the Singapore Management University&#x27;s School of Law (SMU Law) introduced the David Marshall Prize for the top student in criminal law. In 2017, the Yale-NUS College introduced the David Marshall Scholarship for double degree law students. There is also the David Marshall Scholarship by the School of the Arts, Singapore (SOTA), which are awarded to SOTA students who demonstrate artistic talents and excellent academic standing, as well as maintain excellent conduct and participate actively in school events.

In 2011, the Marshall estate donated a bust of Marshall created by Hungarian sculptor Peter Lambda to the SMU Law&#x27;s moot court, which is named after Marshall. His widow Jean expressed the hope that the tribute would inspire all law students at SMU to pursue the qualities of passion, diligence, courage and integrity that had distinguished her late husband&#x27;s remarkable achievements.

<text>West Kowloon (), named after West Kowloon Reclamation Project as a part of Airport Core Programme, is the western part of Kowloon Peninsula in Hong Kong, situated within the Yau Tsim Mong District and Sham Shui Po District. The reclamation spanned from mid-1990s to mid-2003, but major part was completed in 1990s. It represents the new coast area facing Victoria Harbour and West Kowloon Cultural District is its focal point. Multiple railway stations, namely Nam Cheong, Olympic, Austin, Kowloon and Hong Kong West Kowloon stations, are within the area.

Before the 1990s reclamation, the name of West Kowloon were also used to refer western part of Kowloon, such as West Kowloon Corridor and West Kowloon Area Traffic Control System. The area referred to could change over time and have different usages by departments. In legislative elections, it is Kowloon West and its area is changed frequently.

For the reclamation, many of government projects named after West Kowloon, such as West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade, Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station and West Kowloon Cultural District lays in the area bounded by Canton Road to the east, Victoria Harbour to the west and the south, and Jordan Road to the north, overlapping with Ferry Point or Austin. West Kowloon Cultural District, a tourist hotspot, got much attention as the representative of West Kowloon.

But West Kowloon spans much further north and ends in Stonecutters Island, including Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Tai Kok Tsui, Sham Shui Po, Cheung Sha Wan and Lai Chi Kok roughly on the shore side of the West Kowloon Highway. Property agents branded four private housing estate projects, Banyan Garden, Liberte, AquaMarine and The Pacifica, in Cheung Sha Wan as [[West Kowloon Four Little Dragons]] (西九四小龍). Another example is from Environmental Protection Department that West Kowloon Transfer Station is located on the reclamation next to Stonecutters Island. Also, West Kowloon Government Offices situates on the reclamation next to Yau Ma Tei, and West Kowloon Law Courts Building next to Cheung Sha Wan.

== West Kowloon Reclamation ==
It is principally a stretch of reclaimed land, which was subsequently developed in the late 20th century. It has been zoned for mixed commercial, residential and leisure development, and was almost doubled in size with a large reclamation scheme as part of the Airport Core Programme.

== Structures ==
=== Existing ===

* West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade
* West Kowloon Corridor - a bypass connecting Lai Chi Kok Road with the Gascoigne Road Flyover in Yau Ma Tei
* Western Harbour Crossing - Hong Kong&#x27;s third harbour crossing, the Kowloon portal of which is located within West Kowloon
* Kowloon station, Austin station, Olympic station and Nam Cheong station of MTR
* Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station - Hong Kong&#x27;s high speed rail terminal connecting to mainland China.
* International Commerce Centre - the current tallest building in Hong Kong

=== Under construction ===
* West Kowloon Cultural District - leisure and cultural district
* Central Kowloon Route Yau Ma Tei interchange

== Projects ==

=== Existing ===
Commercial projects include International Commerce Centre, a skyscraper which is part of the Union Square project.

Residential projects which have been realised in the sector include The Waterfront (&quot;2000&quot;), Sorrento (&quot;2003&quot;), The Harbourside (&quot;2003&quot;), and The Arch (&quot;2005&quot;), and The Cullinan (&quot;2008&quot;, the tallest residential building in Hong Kong). The above all sit atop Kowloon MTR station, a station on the Tung Chung line and Airport Express line. The shopping-mall Elements started operating on 1 October 2007.

=== Plots auctioned ===
In August 2005, two neighbouring sites near Central Park and Park Avenue were triggered for auction, and were subsequently acquired by a joint venture of Sino Land, Chinese Estates Holdings and Nan Fung Development.

In May 2007, a site bounded by Hoi Wang Road, Yan Cheung Road and Yau Cheung Road was won by a consortium comprising Sino Land, Chinese Estates Holdings, K Wah International and Nan Fung Development, for a bid of HK$4 billion. Following the successful auction of the site, some legislators called for a law to stop developers from constructing tall buildings which maximise good views at the expense of air flow in densely populated areas, but the bid failed.

<text>Joseph Bingham (September 1668 – 17 August 1723) was an English scholar and divine, who wrote on ecclesiastical history.

==Life==
He was born at Wakefield in Yorkshire.

He was educated at Wakefield Grammar School and University College, Oxford, of which he was made fellow in 1689 and tutor in 1691. A sermon preached by him from the university pulpit in St Mary&#x27;s church, on the meaning of the terms &quot;Person and Substance in the Fathers&quot;, brought upon him an accusation of heresy. He was compelled to give up his fellowship and leave the university; but he was immediately presented by Dr John Radcliffe to the rectory of Headbourne Worthy, near Winchester (1695).

In this country retirement he began his extensive work entitled &quot;Origines Ecclesiasticae, or Antiquities of the Christian Church&quot;, the first volume of which appeared in 1708 and the tenth and last in 1722. His design, learnedly, exhaustively and impartially executed, was to give such a methodical account of the antiquities of the Christian Church as others have done of the Greek and Roman and Jewish antiquities, by reducing the ancient customs, usages and practices of the church under certain proper heads, whereby the reader may take a view at once of any particular usage or custom of Christians for four or five centuries.

Notwithstanding his learning and merit, Bingham received no higher preferment than that of Headbourne Worthy until 1712, when he was collated to the rectory of Havant, near Portsmouth, by Sir Jonathan Trelawney, bishop of Winchester. Nearly all his little property was lost in the great South Sea Bubble of 1720.

A grandson was Bishop Richard Mant of Down and Dromore.

He is buried in the churchyard of St Swithun&#x27;s, Headbourne Worthy.

<text>The Norfolk and Western Railway , commonly called the N&amp;W, was a US class I railroad, formed by more than 200 railroad mergers between 1838 and 1982. It was headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia, for most of its existence. Its motto was &quot;Precision Transportation&quot;; it had a variety of nicknames, including &quot;King Coal&quot; and &quot;British Railway of America&quot;. In 1986, N&amp;W merged with Southern Railway to form today&#x27;s Norfolk Southern Railway.

The N&amp;W was famous for manufacturing its own steam locomotives, which were built at the Roanoke Shops, as well as its own hopper cars. After 1960, N&amp;W was the last major Class I railroad using steam locomotives; the last remaining Y class 2-8-8-2s would eventually be retired in 1961.

In December 1959, the N&amp;W merged with the Virginian Railway (reporting mark VGN), a longtime rival in the Pocahontas coal region. By 1970, other mergers with the Nickel Plate Road and Wabash formed a system that operated of road on of track from North Carolina to New York and from Virginia to Iowa.

In 1980, the N&amp;W merged its business operation with those of the Southern Railway, another profitable carrier, to create the Norfolk Southern Corporation holding company. The N&amp;W and the Southern Railway continued as separate railroads operating under the single holding company.

In 1982, the Southern Railway was renamed Norfolk Southern Railway and the holding company transferred the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway to the control of the newly renamed company.

==History==

===Predecessors===
====City Point, Southside and Virginia and Tennessee railroads====
The N&amp;W&#x27;s earliest predecessor was the City Point Railroad (CPRR), a short-line railroad formed in 1838 to extend from City Point (now part of the independent city of Hopewell, Virginia), a port on the tidal James River, to Petersburg, Virginia, on the fall line of the shallower Appomattox River. In 1854, CPRR became part of the South Side Railroad, which connected Petersburg with Lynchburg, where it interchanged through traffic with the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad (V&amp;T) and the James River and Kanawha Canal.

====Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad====
William Mahone (1826–95), an 1847 engineering graduate of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), was employed by Francis Mallory to build the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad (N&amp;P) and eventually became its president in the pre-Civil War era. Construction of N&amp;P began in 1853. Mahone&#x27;s innovative corduroy roadbed through the Great Dismal Swamp near Norfolk, Virginia, employed a log foundation laid at right angles beneath the surface of the swamp. It is still in use 150 years later and it withstands immense tonnages of coal traffic.

Mahone married Otelia Butler, from Smithfield in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, a daughter of Robert Butler (1784–1853), a Virginia state treasurer. Popular legend has it that Otelia and William Mahone traveled along the newly completed N&amp;P naming stations along the tangent between Suffolk and Petersburg from &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, a book she was reading by Walter Scott. From Scott&#x27;s historical Scottish novels, Otelia chose the place names of Windsor, Waverly and Wakefield. She tapped the Scottish Clan &quot;McIvor&quot; for the name of Ivor, a small Southampton County town. When they could not agree on a name for a station just west of the Sussex County line in Prince George, it is said that the young couple invented a new word in honor of their &quot;dispute&quot;, which is how the tiny community of Disputanta was named. The N&amp;P was completed in 1858.

====Civil War====
Of small stature, dynamic &quot;Little Billy&quot; Mahone became a major general in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. He was widely regarded as the hero of the Battle of the Crater during the Siege of Petersburg in 1864–65. Otelia Mahone served as a nurse in the Confederate capital of Richmond.

The N&amp;P was severed by the war. The portion east of the Blackwater River at Zuni, Virginia, was held by the Union for most of the war. The eastern portion of the City Point Railroad played a crucial role for Union General Ulysses S. Grant during the Siege of Petersburg, and was operated by the United States Military Railroad. The South Side Railroad was also heavily damaged.

===Early years===
====Beginning as the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad====
William and Otelia Mahone were illustrious characters in post-bellum Virginia. Mahone got quickly to work restoring &quot;his&quot; N&amp;P, and resumed his dream of linking the three trunk lines across the southern tier of Virginia to reach points to the west. He became president of all three, and drove the 1870 merger of N&amp;P, South Side Railroad and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad to form the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&amp;O). The AM&amp;O extended from Norfolk to Bristol, Virginia. The Mahones moved to the headquarters city of Lynchburg, the midpoint of the AM&amp;O. The acronym AM&amp;O was said to stand for &quot;All Mine and Otelia&#x27;s.&quot;

The AM&amp;O operated profitably in the early 1870s but like many railroads encountered financial problems during the Panic of 1873. A fourth road of the AM&amp;O family was planned to extend west through the Cumberland Gap to Kentucky, but was never built. Mahone retained control of AM&amp;O for several more years before his relationship with English and Scottish bondholders deteriorated in 1876 and receivers were appointed to oversee his work. After several years of operating under receiverships, Mahone&#x27;s role as a railroad builder ended in 1881 when northern financial interests took control.

At the foreclosure auction, the AM&amp;O was purchased by E.W. Clark &amp; Co., a private banking firm in Philadelphia with ties to the large Pennsylvania Railroad. The PRR was seeking a southern connection for its Shenandoah Valley Railroad (SVRR), which was then under construction up the valley from the Potomac River.

====Name change to Norfolk and Western====

In 1881, the AM&amp;O was reorganized and renamed Norfolk and Western, a name perhaps taken from an 1850s charter application filed by citizens of Norfolk, Virginia. George Frederick Tyler became president. Frederick J. Kimball, a civil engineer and partner in E.W. Clark &amp; Co., became First Vice President. Henry Fink, whom Mahone had hired in 1855, became Second Vice President and General Superintendent.

Kimball and his board of directors selected Big Lick, a small Virginia village on the Roanoke River, to be the junction of SVRR and the N&amp;W. Big Lick was later renamed Roanoke, Virginia. Over time, Roanoke began to grow and in the 1950s, reached a population of over 90,000.

At its founding, the N&amp;W primarily transported agricultural products. Kimball, who had a strong interest in geology, led the railroad&#x27;s efforts to open the Pocahontas coalfields in western Virginia and southern West Virginia. In mid-1881, the N&amp;W acquired the franchises to four other lines: the New River Railroad, Mining and Manufacturing Company, the Bluestone Railroad, and the East River Railroad. Consolidated into the New River Railroad Company, with Kimball as president, these railroads became the basis for N&amp;W&#x27;s New River Division, which was soon built from New Kanawha (near East Radford) up the west bank of the New River through Pulaski County and into Giles County to the mouth of the East River near Glen Lyn, Virginia. From there, the new line ran up the East River, crossing the Virginia-West Virginia border several times to reach the coalfields to the west near the Great Flat Top Mountain. Coal transported to Norfolk soon became NW&#x27;s primary commodity, and led to great wealth and profitability.
Kimball served as N&amp;W president from 1883 to 1895. Under his leadership, the N&amp;W continued expansion westward with its lines through the wilderness of West Virginia with the Ohio Extension, eventually extending north across the Ohio River to Columbus, Ohio by the Scioto Valley Railroad. Acquisition of other lines, including the Cincinnati, Portsmouth and Virginia Railroad (CP&amp;V) (which it had long supported and leased) extended the N&amp;W system west along the Ohio River to Cincinnati, Ohio, south from Lynchburg to Durham, North Carolina, and south from Roanoke to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. By the time Kimball died in 1903, the railroad had attained the basic structure it would use for more than 60 years.

In 1890 the N&amp;W bought out the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. This gave the railroad a reach north of the Potomac River and the Virginia-Maryland border, and a line with territory reaching as far north as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. This would become referred to as the &quot;Shenandoah Valley Division.&quot;

====Coal====

In 1885, several small mining companies representing about of bituminous coal reserves grouped together to form the coalfields&#x27; largest landowner, the Philadelphia-based Flat-Top Coal Land Association.The N&amp;W bought the association and reorganized it as the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company (PCCC). The PCCC was later renamed the Pocahontas Land Corporation (PLC) and is now a subsidiary of NS.

As the availability and fame of high-quality Pocahontas bituminous coal increased, economic forces took over. Coal operators and their employees settled dozens of towns in southern West Virginia, and in the next few years, as coal demand swelled, some of them amassed fortunes. The countryside was soon sprinkled with tipples, coke ovens, houses for workers, company stores and churches. In the four decades before the Crash of 1929 and subsequent Depression, these coal towns flourished. One example was the small community of Bramwell, West Virginia, which in its heyday boasted the highest per capita concentration of millionaires in the country.

In 1886, the N&amp;W tracks were extended directly to coal piers at Lambert&#x27;s Point, which was located in Norfolk County just north of the City of Norfolk on the Elizabeth River, where one of the busiest coal export facilities in the world was built to reach Hampton Roads shipping. A residential section was also developed to house the families of the workers. Many early residents of Lambert&#x27;s Point were involved in the coal industry.

====Roanoke Shops====
The company was famous for building its own steam locomotives, a practice rare outside Britain (where most railways either built their own locomotives or had outside contractors build locomotives to their designs). The locomotives were built at the Roanoke Shops at Roanoke. The Shops employed thousands of craftsmen, who refined their products over the years. The A, J, and Y6 locomotives, designed, built and maintained by NW personnel, brought the company industry-wide fame for its excellence in steam power. The N&amp;W&#x27;s commitment to steam power was due in part to its investment in the manufacturing capacity and human resources to build and operate steam locomotives, and partially due to the major commodity it hauled, coal. During the 1950s, N&amp;W rebuilt its W Class 2-8-0 Consolidations into Shop Co W6 0-8-0Ts. In 1960, the N&amp;W became the last major railroad in the United States to abandon steam locomotives for diesel-electric motive power. The Roanoke Shops continued to build and repair rolling stock until 2020 when Norfolk Southern closed them, ending 139 years of operations.

To bolster the Roanoke locomotive department, in 1916 the N&amp;W added a large terminal (one full-circle roundhouse and two half-circle roundhouses), car shops, and yard at Shaffers Crossing, west of downtown. These continued to operate after the conversion to diesel power.

Because the Roanoke Shops were so large and complete, the only other heavy repair site needed was located in Portsmouth, Ohio to serve the western section of the system, which employed about 2,000 in the 1920s. These shops took the place of the roundhouse and shop at Bluefield, West Virginia.

===Later years===
====Roanoke &amp; Southern====
The Roanoke &amp; Southern Railway Company was organized in 1887, succeeding separate companies called Roanoke &amp; Southern in North Carolina and Virginia. Norfolk and Western leased the Roanoke &amp; Southern (called the Norfolk, Roanoke &amp; Southern Rail Road by 1896) starting in 1892 but it became part of Norfolk and Western in 1911.

====World Wars, Great Depression, and efficiencies====

The N&amp;W operated profitably through World War I and World War II and paid regular dividends throughout the Depression. During World War I, the N&amp;W was jointly operated with VGN under the USRA&#x27;s wartime takeover of the Pocahontas Roads. The operating efficiencies were significant, and after the war, when the railroads were returned to their respective owners and competitive status, the N&amp;W never lost sight of the VGN and its low-gradient routing through Virginia. N&amp;W meanwhile during World War 2 used their J&#x27;s, K1&#x27;s, A Class, and S1 Switchers to handle the troop trains from Ohio to Norfolk, a point of embarkation. Other three were New York, San Francisco, and San Diego. However, the US Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) turned down attempts at combining the roads until 1959, when a proposed N&amp;W-VGN merger was finally approved.
The N&amp;W also operated safely in this time, being the recipient of the Gold E. H. Harriman Award for 1938. In a promotional booklet published in 1939, the N&amp;W wrote &quot;For the second time in 12 years, the American Museum of Safety has awarded the Harriman Memorial Gold Medal to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway for the outstanding safety record during 1938 among class I railroads of the United States.&quot; It is further noted that the railway carried one million passengers more than without incident in the period from 1924 to 1938.

At the end of 1925, the N&amp;W operated of route on track; at the end of 1956 NW operated of route on of track.

====Acquiring the Virginian Railway====

VGN was conceived and built by William Nelson Page and Henry Huttleston Rogers. Page had helped engineer and build the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) through the mountains of West Virginia and Rogers had already become a millionaire and a principal of Standard Oil before their partnership was formed early in the 20th century.

Initially, their project was an -long short line railroad. After failing to establish favorable rates to interchange coal traffic with the big railroads (who shut them out through collusion), the project expanded. Rogers was apparently a silent partner in the early stages, and the bigger railroads did not take Page seriously. However, the partners planned and then built a &quot;Mountains to Sea&quot; railroad from the coal fields of southern West Virginia to port near Norfolk at Sewell&#x27;s Point in the harbor of Hampton Roads. They accomplished this right under the noses of the pre-existing and much bigger C&amp;O and N&amp;W railroads and their leaders by forming two small intrastate railroads, Deepwater Railway, in West Virginia, and Tidewater Railway in Virginia. Once right-of-way and land acquisitions had been secured, the two small railroads were merged in 1907 to form the Virginian Railway.

Engineered by Page and financed almost entirely from Rogers&#x27; personal resources, VGN lines were laid on the principle that picking the best route and buying the best equipment would save operating expenses.

Mark Twain spoke at VGN&#x27;s dedication in Norfolk, Virginia, only 6 weeks before Rogers died in May 1909 after his only inspection trip on the newly completed railroad. That June, Booker T. Washington made a whistle-stop speaking tour on VGN, traveling in Rogers&#x27; private car, Dixie, and later revealing that Rogers had been instrumental in funding many small country schools and institutions of higher education in the South for the betterment of Black communities.

VGN operated over more modern alignments than the C&amp;O, and the N&amp;W, and its track was built to the highest standards. It provided major competition for coal traffic to C&amp;O and the N&amp;W. The VGN followed Rogers&#x27; philosophy throughout its profitable history, earning the nickname &quot;Richest Little Railroad in the World.&quot; It operated some of the largest and most powerful steam, electric, and diesel locomotives.

The VGN electrified of its route between 1922 and 1926 at a cost of $15 million, and had its own power plant at Narrows, Virginia. It shared electrical resources with N&amp;W from 1925 to 1950, when the N&amp;W discontinued its own, shorter, electrified section through the Elkhorn Tunnel and Great Flat Top Mountain region. The VGN track was de-electrified in 1962, after the N&amp;W-VGN merger.

====Merger era: 1960–1982====

In 1955, the N&amp;W operated in North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland, and Ohio. In 1959, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approved VGN&#x27;s merger into the N&amp;W.

In 1964, the former Wabash; Nickel Plate; Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway; and Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad were brought into the system in one of the most complex mergers of the era. This consolidation, plus the 1976 addition of a more direct route to Chicago, Illinois, made N&amp;W an important Midwestern railroad that provided direct single-line service between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes and Mississippi River.

In 1968, the N&amp;W formed Dereco, a holding company that owned the Delaware &amp; Hudson (D&amp;H) and Erie Lackawanna (EL) railroads. Dereco&#x27;s troubled railroads were not merged into the N&amp;W: EL eventually joined Conrail and D&amp;H was sold to Guilford Transportation Industries; it is now part of Canadian Pacific.

In 1970, the N&amp;W operated in North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa.

In 1980, the song &quot;There&#x27;s No Stopping Us&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;Cargo Movin&#x27; People,&quot; was written and recorded by the J. Walter Thompson Company for the railroad as a part of the railroad&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s No Stopping Us&quot; advertising campaign. It eventually made its way onto the Mark I Video program titled &quot;Rails to Roanoke&quot; in 1987. On September 1, 1981, the N&amp;W acquired Illinois Terminal Railroad. The N&amp;W was also a major investor in Piedmont Airlines. 

By 1996, N&amp;W ran in most of the Midwest and Eastern states. Many N&amp;W lines by 1998 were abandoned and some of them were never used again. However, the Norfolk to Bluefield line still exists but traffic has slowed because of its 12-mile 1.2% grade.

=====Autoracks=====
In the 1950s, Canadian National Railway (CN) introduced a group of innovative bi-level autorack railcars. These autoracks had end doors and were very large by the standards of the time; at long, each autorack could carry 8 completed automobiles. These autoracks were a big success and helped lead to the development of today&#x27;s fully enclosed autoracks. Tri-level autoracks were developed in the 1970s.

During the 1960s, autoracks took over rail transportation of newly completed automobiles in North America. They carried more cars in the same space and were easier to load and unload than the boxcars formerly used. Ever-larger auto carriers and specialized terminals were developed by NW and other railroads.

The railroads were able to provide lower costs and greater protection from in-transit damage, such as that which may occur due to vandalism or weather and traffic conditions on unenclosed truck trailers. Using the autoracks, the railroads became the primary long-distance transporter of completed automobiles, one of few commodities where the industry has been able to overcome trucking in competition.

===Becoming part of the Norfolk Southern Corporation===
In 1980, the profitable N&amp;W teamed up with the Southern Railway, another profitable company, to form the Norfolk Southern Corporation and it paved the way for today&#x27;s Norfolk Southern Railway (formerly the Southern Railway) to compete more effectively with CSX Transportation, itself a combination of smaller railroads in the eastern half of the United States.

Today, former N&amp;W trackage remains a vital portion of the Norfolk Southern Railway, a Fortune 500 company. The headquarters of the Norfolk Southern Railway and the parent Norfolk Southern Corporation are now located in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Passenger operations==

While the &quot;Powhatan Arrow&quot; (all-coach, Norfolk–Cincinnati/Columbus) was the N&amp;W&#x27;s flagship passenger train, sporting a regal maroon livery with gold trim and hauled by a J Class 4-8-4 Northern Type steam locomotive, the railroad also operated a number of other passenger trains. These include:

* &quot;The Cavalier&quot; (coaches and Pullmans, Norfolk–Cincinnati/Columbus).
* &quot;The Pocahontas&quot; (coaches and Pullmans, Norfolk–Cincinnati/Columbus).

The N&amp;W also participated in five inter-line passenger trains:
* Trains 1 and 2 (Roanoke–Hagerstown, Maryland) which continued in a pool arrangement with the Pennsylvania Railroad from Hagerstown to Harrisburg to New York via North Philadelphia. This allowed for a trip from western Virginia to New York, bypassing Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. In contrast with other N&amp;W trains from south of Roanoke which traveled east from Roanoke, this overnight train continued north from Roanoke along the Shenandoah Valley Route, via Waynesboro, VA. Sleeping car passengers would be able to take the trip continuously, without a change of coach in Harrisburg.
* &quot;Cannon Ball&quot; (New York – Norfolk in conjunction with Pennsylvania Railroad, Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad).
* &quot;Birmingham Special&quot; (New York – Birmingham, Alabama in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad and Southern Railway).
* &quot;The Pelican&quot; (New York – New Orleans in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad and Southern Railway).
* &quot;The Tennessean&quot; (New York – Memphis in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Railroad and Southern Railway).

The last three were unusual in that the Southern Railway operated the trains, either side of the N&amp;W stretch between Lynchburg and Bristol.

The Norfolk-bound trains arrived at Norfolk Terminal Station, which also served as the N&amp;W company offices.

==Steam locomotive types on the Norfolk and Western==
* Class A: 2-6-6-4 simple articulated Top Speed: 
* Class Y1 though Y6b: 2-8-8-2 Mallet Top Speed: 
* Class J: 4-8-4 Top Speed:

* Class E1: 4-6-2 Top Speed: 
* Class E2: 4-6-2 Top Speed: 
* Class W: 2-8-0 Top Speed: 

==Surviving steam locomotives==
The N&amp;W had run excursion trains since its first days of passenger traffic, and deliberately powered them with steam engines after 1960, when most other trains had been switched to diesels. The excursion trains were powered by several of the N&amp;W&#x27;s famous steam locomotives, including J class #611 and A class #1218. The practice continued after the 1982 merger, under the first president of the merged Norfolk Southern, Robert B. Claytor, but was finally halted in 1994.

Today, #1218 is on static display at the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia; #611 has been restored to working order for the VMT by the North Carolina Transportation Museum; N&amp;W class Y6a #2156 has been brought to Roanoke from the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri; and Class M #475 continues to operate at the Strasburg Railroad in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, where #611 participated for the &quot;Reunion of Steam&quot; event in fall 2019.

N&amp;W Class M #433 survives at the trailhead of the Virginia Creeper in Abingdon, Virginia. The Virginia Creeper runs on the old right-of-way where the Abingdon branch line remains.

N&amp;W Class E2a #578 is displayed at the Ohio Railway Museum in Worthington, Ohio.

Four other engines survive known as the Lost Engines of Roanoke; a group of engines that survived in a Roanoke Scrapyard from the late 1950s until all were retrieved in 2009. These four engines included Class W2 2-8-0 #917, Class M2s #1118 and #1134, and Class M2c #1151. #917 is displayed without a tender in Bellville, Ohio as a display for a restaurant. M2 #1118 is owned by the Roanoke Chapter Historical Society without a tender. M2 #1134 is displayed in Portsmouth VA at the Railroad Museum of Virginia with a tender. M2c #1151 is owned by the Virginia Museum of Transportation and currently sits unrestored with a tender from an A class engine.

N&amp;W Class Y3a #2050 is also preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois.

<doc id="1095131" wikidata="Q3647098" url="?curid=1095131" title="Kinesthetic learning">
<text>Kinesthetic learning (American English), kinaesthetic learning (British English), or tactile learning is learning that involves physical activity. As cited by Favre (2009), Dunn and Dunn define kinesthetic learners as students who prefer whole-body movement to process new and difficult information. However, scientific studies do not support the claim that using kinesthetic modality improves learning in students identified as kinesthetic learning as their preferred learning style.

== History ==
Kinesthetic intelligence, which was originally coupled with tactile abilities, was defined and discussed in Howard Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Frames Of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences&quot; in 1983. In this book, Gardner describes activities such as dancing and performing surgeries as requiring great kinesthetic intelligence: using the body to create (or do) something.

Margaret H&#x27;Doubler wrote and spoke about kinesthetic learning during the 1940s, defining kinesthetic learning as the human body&#x27;s ability to express itself through movement and dance.

Viktor Lowenfeld used the term in his textbook for art educators, &quot;Creative and Mental Growth&quot;.

== The VARK model ==
Neil Fleming, a New Zealand teacher and educational theorist, designed the VARK model (visual, aural or auditory, read/write and kinesthetic). According to Fleming&#x27;s model, kinesthetic learners are similar to tactile learners in that they like hands-on experiential learning. They excel in concrete learning such as on-the-job training, work experience, internships, simulations and so forth (Kte&#x27;pi, 2016).

The Fleming VAK/VARK model (one of the most common and widely used categorizations of the various types of learning styles) categorized learning styles as follows:
* Hands-on learning
* Visual learning
* Auditory learning
* Read/write learning
* Kinesthetic learning
Skill memory also fits into the category of kinesthetic learning, as it is what happens when somebody is learning kinesthetically. Skill memories are difficult to convey except by direct demonstration, may be acquired without awareness, and require several repetitions.

== Classification ==
Rita Dunn contends that kinesthetic and tactile learning are the same style. Galeet BenZion asserts that kinesthetic and tactile learning are separate learning styles, with different characteristics. She defined kinesthetic learning as the process that results in new knowledge (or understanding) with the involvement of the learner&#x27;s body movement. This movement is performed to establish new knowledge or extend existing knowledge. Kinesthetic learning is at its best, BenZion found, when the learner uses language (their own words) in order to define, explain, resolve and sort out how their body&#x27;s movement reflects the concept explored. One example is a student using movement to work out the sum of 1/2 plus 3/4 via movement, then explaining how their motions in space reflect the mathematical process leading to the correct answer.

In addition, Denig (2004) in his article &#x27;Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles: Two Complementary Dimensions&#x27;, presented Dunn and Dunn&#x27;s Learning Styles Model, which addresses 21 elements that affect students&#x27; learning. These elements are broken down into five stimuli: environmental, emotional, sociological, physiological and psychological variables. Under this model, physiological stimuli consist of four elements, one of which is perceptual. Perceptual depicts the auditory, visual, tactual and kinesthetic styles whereby learners learn more effectively. This gives meaning to the concept that kinesthetic learners learn best through whole-body activities and experiences while tactual learners learn best through manipulation of items with their hands.

Tactile learning utilizes students&#x27; sense of touch to explore and understand their surroundings, emphasizing sensory experiences for cognitive growth, allowing direct interaction and manipulation.

== Kinesthetic memory ==
Depending upon memory systems the kinesthetic learners respond differently. The different kinds of learners mainly include whole body learners, hands-on learners, doodlers, students learning through emotional experiences. The learning and the memory is generally short term. To achieve a long-term memory different techniques can be used depending on the learning style. Mind mapping, story mapping, webbing, drawing can be used to enhance the learning of a doodler. For the hands-on learner, role play, clay, building and math manipulative can be used. The whole book body learner can learn better through role-playing, body mapping, puzzles and use of computer technology which allows for certain movement while learning. Students can be engaged in group activities and activities which involve bodily movement such as dance, drama, sports can be used to nurture their learning. The following strategies can be used to facilitate kinesthetic memory through procedural motor pathway such as:
* Dance: ideas, concepts and processes can be expressed through creative movements
* Laboratory demonstrations
* Sports
* Gymnastics
* Charades
The kinesthetic learners who have memories associated with emotions learning can be facilitated through dance, debate, drama, role-play, and charades. This kind of learning leads to a long-term memory since it is associated with emotions such as , curiosity, anger, disappointment and success.

== Kinds of skill memory ==
Perceptual-motor skills are skills learned by movement patterns guided by sensory inputs. There are closed skills and open skills. Closed skills are skills learned such as dance. A ballerina learns a specific set of moves and doesn&#x27;t stray from the exact routine, which is why it is called a closed skill; there is one option. Open skills are skills that require more flexibility in learning such as team sports. A person learning how to play football learns multiple drills, strategies, and practices scrimmages in order to learn how to work in multiple types of environments. Because no football game is the same, and a person can&#x27;t know going into a game the exact steps the other team is going to take, open skills are required to become successful. Cognitive skills also are a part of kinesthetic learning, perceptual learning, and skill memories. Some people learn better in an environment that is more hands-on, and this builds their cognitive skills as well. Cognitive skills are skills which require individuals to solve problems or apply strategies rather than to move their bodies based on what they perceive. Solving a puzzle would be an example of a cognitive skill.

== Management strategies ==
Learners with kinesthetic preferences believe that they learn through active movements and experiences. Activities such as playing, puppetry, drama, acting and designing ensures involvement of the learners.

Some strategies that purportedly motivate students who prefer this learning involve unmotivated students during activities:
* Motivate the students by giving attention and reward, avoid punishment.
* Students should be provided with option to choose activities for learning a particular concept
* Grades can be allotted depending on the participation by using score rubrics
* Activities chosen should encourage all the students to succeed and feel that have accomplished learning through an activity
* Every student has to be given equal opportunity to participate
* Cooperative activities can be organized and positive feedback can be given to encourage the participants teamwork in a class

Some strategies are claimed to be effective in managing hyper motivated students are:
* Encourage the students to organize body movement during activities
* Regular monitoring of the students
* Appropriate and accurate directions have to be given for any activity
* Before involving the students in the activity, the consequences of the task going out of control has to be clearly explained.

== Kinesthetic learners in the classroom ==

Subjects can be taught to cater for kinesthetic learners. Through a strength-based and learner-centered approach, educators should engage kinesthetic students in activities that require movements because they learn by doing. Activities could include role-plays, drama, dance, races and competitions, field trips and projects.

Favre (2009) stated that instructional strategies should include movement in a game-like format. Favre suggested designing kinesthetic games. For example, &quot;game boards such as Tic-Tac-Toe affixed to the classroom floor and hopscotch template painted on the playground tarmac or sidewalks around the school&quot; (p. 32). Favre also suggested that instructors can use &quot;commercial games such as Twister, Jeopardy and Nerf basketball and create game cards that align with their lesson objectives&quot; (pp. 32–33).

Reese &amp; Dunn (2007) in their research of college freshmen learning styles provided recommended that &quot;to ensure success for kinesthetic learners, classes should provide active experiences for planning or carrying out objectives, such as visits, project, role playing, simulations and floor or wall games&quot; (p. 108).

Dena Lister highlights the improvements that were found in classroom performance of sixth-grade learning-support students. Lister writes, &quot;The LSS students also produced significantly the first Learning-Style treatment, suggesting that this particular Learning-Style instructional approach, rather than Traditional teaching, was a more effective instructional strategy for these students.&quot;

AJ Richards points out it can be very helpful for physics instructors to develop and employ pedagogical techniques that help students to visualize and to reason productively about these concepts. A particularly effective strategy uses kinesthetic learning activities.

== Signs of a kinesthetic learner ==
Skylar Anderson points out signs that may lead one to believing they are a kinesthetic learner. For example, in his work he states the following signs: your knee is bouncing constantly. You regularly kick a soccer ball, or toss a baseball, or spin a basketball on your finger while having a conversation. You crack your fingers while preparing for, or doing, an activity. You talk using your hands as a complement to your speech. You pace when you really need to cram information for a test. You mime things to boost your memory. You have gotten in trouble more than twice for tapping your pencil on your desk or clicking your pen in the same class period. You think best when you&#x27;re exercising. You remember your notes best when you&#x27;ve written them down with your hand rather than typing them out. You touch everything you pass in a store without thinking about it.

== Brain substrates involved ==
There are three parts of the brain that are the most important to kinesthetic and skill learning. The basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, and the cerebellum all play equally important roles in the ability to learn new skills and master them.

The basal ganglia are a collection of ganglia (clusters of neurons) that lie at the base of the forebrain. The basal ganglia receive information from other parts of the brain such as the hippocampus and cortical areas that send messages about the outside world. Most of these messages are sensory, meaning what a person is physically feeling. The basal ganglia then interpret this information and sends it on a path to the thalamus and the brain stem which both play large factors in physical movement. Therefore, the basal ganglia are the beginning of the process for somebody who is learning-by-doing to respond viscerally to the stimuli around them. It is important once a skill is learned to practice it. This can change how basal ganglia circuits participate in the performance of that skill and that synaptic plasticity is a basic neural mechanism enabling such changes. The more a person practices, the more plasticity they develop.

The cerebral cortex is the brain tissue covering the top and sides of the brain in most vertebrates. It is involved in storing and processing of sensory inputs and motor outputs. In the human brain, the cerebral cortex is actually a sheet of neural tissue about 1/8th inch thick. The sheet is folded so that it can fit inside the skull. The neural circuits in this area of the brain expand with practice of an activity, just like the synaptic plasticity grows with practice. Clarification of some of the mechanisms of learning by neuroscience has been advanced, in part, by the advent of non-invasive imaging technologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). These technologies have allowed researchers to observe human learning processes directly. Through these types of technologies, we are now able to see and study what happens in the process of learning. In different tests performed the brain being imaged showed a greater blood flow and activation to that area of the brain being stimulated through different activities such as finger tapping in a specific sequence. It has been revealed that the process at the beginning of learning a new skill happens quickly, and later on slows down to almost a plateau. This process can also be referred to as The Law of Learning. The slower learning showed in the FMRI that in the cerebral cortex this was when the long term learning was occurring, suggesting that the structural changes in the cortex reflect the enhancement of skill memories during later stages of training. When a person studies a skill for a longer duration of time, but in a shorter amount of time they will learn quickly, but also only retain the information into their short-term memory. Just like studying for an exam; if a student tries to learn everything the night before, it will not stick in the long run. If a person studies a skill for a shorter duration of time, but more frequently and long-term, their brain will retain this information much longer as it is stored in the long-term memory. Functional and structural studies of the brain have revealed a vast interconnectivity between diverse regions of the cerebral cortex. For example, large numbers of axons interconnect the posterior sensory areas serving vision, audition, and touch with anterior motor regions. Constant communication between sensation and movement makes sense, because to execute smooth movement through the environment, movement must be continuously integrated with knowledge about one&#x27;s surroundings obtained via sensory perception. The cerebral cortex plays a role in allowing humans to do this.

The cerebellum is critical to the ability for a human or animal to be able to regulate movement. This area of the brain wraps around the brain stem and is very densely packed with neurons and neural connections. This part of the brain is involved in timing as well as movement. It assists in predicting events, especially in the formation, execution, and timing of conditioned responses. The cerebellum plays a very important role in all forms of kinesthetic learning and motor function. For a ballerina, it is important to be able to control their movements and time it exactly right for their routine. For a football player it is important to be able to regulate movement when running throwing, and being able to have control over where the ball goes as well as the timing of it.

And all three of these important systems in the brain function together as a team, one not being more important than the other. They work together to allow for responding to sensory events, timing, controlling physical actions, and more. However, it is important to remember that unless a person is actively practicing, these parts of the brain won&#x27;t help them get to their full potential. Alterations in the brain that occur during learning seem to make the nerve cells more efficient or powerful. Studies have shown that animals raised in complex environments have a greater volume of capillaries per nerve cell—and therefore a greater supply of blood to the brain—than the caged animals, regardless of whether the caged animal lived alone or with companions. Overall, these studies depict an orchestrated pattern of increased capacity in the brain that depends on experience.

<text>Fort Mifflin, originally called Fort Island Battery and also known as Mud Island Fort, was commissioned in 1771 and sits on Mud Island (or Deep Water Island) on the Delaware River below Philadelphia, Pennsylvania near Philadelphia International Airport.

During the American Revolutionary War, the British Army bombarded and captured the fort as part of their conquest of Philadelphia in autumn 1777. In 1795, the fort was renamed for Thomas Mifflin, a Continental Army officer and the first post-independence Pennsylvania governor.

The U.S. Army began rebuilding the fort in 1794, and continued to garrison and build on the site into the 19th century. Fort Mifflin housed prisoners during the American Civil War. The U.S. Army decommissioned Fort Mifflin for active duty infantry and artillery in 1962.

While the older portion of the fort was returned to the City of Philadelphia, a portion of the fort&#x27;s grounds are still actively used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, making it the oldest fort in use by the U.S. military. Historic preservationists have restored the fort, which has been named a National Historic Landmark.

==History==
===Colonial defense of Philadelphia===


Built in 1681 in Philadelphia near the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, Fort Mifflin was recognized as strategically important because of the role it played in defense of the settlement. However, William Penn, a Quaker with religious objections to military life, left Philadelphia undefended. When European colonists established permanent settlements, they also traditionally provided protection of those settlements, but Quakers founded the only significant European settlements without any such fortifications. Since the Quakers rejected the military, they instead sought to make peace with Native American tribes in the area and avoid any need to fortify their settlements militarily. While other colonies suffered from conflict and warfare, Philadelphia prospered.

By the 1740s, Fort Mifflin ranked as the richest British port in the New World. French and Spanish privateers then entered the Delaware River, threatening the city. During King George&#x27;s War between 1744 and 1748, Benjamin Franklin raised a militia because the legislators of the city, most of whom were Quakers, were opposed to military engagement and refused to defend Philadelphia &quot;either by erecting fortifications or building Ships of War&quot;. Franklin raised money to create earthwork defenses and to buy artillery.

At the end of the war, commanders disbanded the militia and left derelict the defenses of the city. With renewed colonial warfare in the 1750s, especially the French and Indian War, plans were drawn up for a fort on Mud Island, but no fort was built. Only in the 1770s did the city acquire permanent fortifications.

By 1771, Philadelphia ranked as the largest British port and dockyard in North America. Locals then rose in protest against British economic policies and imports. In response to complaints by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Pennsylvania governor John Penn asked General Thomas Gage to send someone capable of designing defenses for the city. He intended to have a fort on Mud Island that would help regulate traffic entering and exiting the port. Gage assigned Captain John Montresor of the British Corps of Engineers to the task. Montresor presented six designs to Penn and the Board of Commissioners; the board proposed constructing a fort on Mud Island (also known as Deep Water Island).

The commissioners reviewed the plans, found them all too expensive, and insisted on economy despite Montresor&#x27;s protestations about the budget. Montresor stated that his preferred plan cost about £40,000 and that he intended to mount &quot;32 pieces of cannon, 4 mortars and 4 royal howitzers ... which at 6 men each make 240 men required, 160 musketry, in all 400 garrison.&quot; The colonial Provincial Assembly passed a bill releasing £15,000 for the construction of the fort and the purchase of Mud Island from Joseph Galloway, the Speaker of the House. The board instructed Montresor to begin construction but failed to provide him with the funds that he considered necessary to do so properly.

The rooms in the farthest interior of &quot;Casemate #11&quot; probably date from the original construction in 1771. On 4 June 1772, Montresor left the head workman in charge of the construction project and returned to New York disgruntled. The project floundered onward for about a year, when it stopped for lack of guidance and funding. The crews completed only the east and south walls, built in stone.

===American Revolutionary War===


Following the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin headed a committee to provide for the defense of the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Committee of Public Safety soon restarted construction on the fort and finally completed it in 1776.

The committee simultaneously also built Fort Mercer in New Jersey, on the eastern bank of the Delaware River across from Fort Mifflin. The Americans intended to use Fort Mifflin and Fort Mercer to restrict the activity of the Royal Navy on the Delaware River, guarding against General Howe and Admiral Reynolds&#x27; advance naval fleet on the Delaware.

Defenders of Philadelphia assembled &quot;chevaux de frise&quot; obstacles, placed in tiers spanning the width of the Delaware between Forts Mercer and Mifflin. These defenses comprised wooden-framed &quot;boxes&quot;, 30 feet square, constructed of huge timbers and lined with pine planks. Defenders lowered these frames onto the riverbed and filled each with 20 to 40 tons of stone to anchor it in place. They placed two or three large timbers tipped with iron spikes into each frame, set underwater and facing obliquely downstream. They then chained the boxes together to maintain continuity. The &quot;chevaux de frise&quot; presented a formidable obstacle that could impale unwitting ships. The system&#x27;s design included gaps to allow passage of friendly shipping. Only a select few patriot navigators knew the locations of safe passage through this barrier. Soldiers at Forts Mercer and Mifflin could fire at anyone attempting to dismantle these obstacles. Similar obstacles were built downriver at Fort Billingsport, New Jersey, but that area fell to the British on October 2, 1777.

After Washington&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Brandywine, the British took control of Philadelphia in September 1777 during their Philadelphia campaign. British forces then laid siege to Fort Mifflin and Fort Mercer in early October 1777, unsuccessfully attacking the latter by land and river in the Battle of Red Bank on October 22. The British intended the siege to open up their supply lines via the Delaware River. Montresor earlier designer and constructor of Fort Mifflin, planned and built the siege works used against Fort Mifflin. He then led the siege and destroyed much of the fort. During the siege, four hundred American soldiers were besieged by two thousand British troops and a Royal Navy squadron. On November 10, 1777, the British intensified their assault, launching an incessant barrage of cannonballs into the fort. Among those stationed at the fort was private Joseph Plumb Martin, who later wrote an account of the battle.

Defending the riverway Commodore John Hazelwood with a sizable fleet of galleys, sloops, and fire-vessels launched several raids on British positions on shore, constantly harassing their river operations while patrolling the waters around the fort. On November 15, 1777, the Americans evacuated the fort. Their resistance had effectively denied the Royal Navy free use of the Delaware River and allowed the successful repositioning of the Continental Army for the Battle of White Marsh and subsequent withdrawal to Valley Forge. Fort Mifflin experienced the heaviest bombardment of the American Revolutionary War. The siege left 250 of the 406 to 450 men garrisoned at the Fort Mifflin killed or wounded. Comrades-in-arms ferried these dead and wounded to the mainland before the final evacuation. Fort Mifflin never again saw military action.

Of the original Fort Mifflin, only the white stone walls of the fort survive today. The pockmarks in these stone walls evidence the intensity of the British bombardment of 1777. Local residents know this siege and massive bombardment as the Battle of Mud Island.

===Reconstruction during War of 1812===

The ruins of Fort Mifflin lay derelict until 1793, when rebuilding began under what was later called the first system of U.S. coastal fortifications. In 1794, Pierre L&#x27;Enfant, also responsible for planning Washington, D.C., supervised the reconstruction, including the design and rebuilding of the fort. Reconstruction work began on the fort in 1795, under the auspices of engineer officer Louis de Tousard, who from 1795 to 1800 traveled along the coast between Massachusetts and the Carolinas working on coastal defenses. The initial goal was to rebuild the fort to accommodate 48 guns. The army probably built the outer room of &quot;Casemate #11&quot; during the reconstruction of the fort from 1794 through 1798 and used it as a &quot;proof room&quot; to make cannon charges. The buildings at Fort Mifflin included barracks for soldiers in the 1790s, measuring by and consisting of two stories. The original barracks contained seven rooms, five of them each designed to house 25 men. The army officially named the fort after Thomas Mifflin, a Continental Army officer and the first post-independence Governor of Pennsylvania, in 1795. Rebuilding the fort consumed $94,000 of a total fort budget of $278,000 in 1798 and 1799 alone (in 1799 money). Also, the US Congress met in Philadelphia until 1800 and Fort Mifflin was well garrisoned until then, usually with two companies.

Over a cross-shaped hole in the ground previously designated as a last-ditch defensive area near the center of the fort, the army built the extant citadel structure to house the commandant in 1796. Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Rochefontaine replaced Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant as chief engineer at Fort Mifflin in 1798 and completed the citadel structure to house the commandant. Lieutenant Colonel Rochfontaine used and improved original designs of L&#x27;Enfant. The Commandant&#x27;s House exemplifies Greek Revival architecture, rare on Army installations in the United States. The army also built the six cavelike casemates as defensive structures in the case of an enemy siege during the reconstruction of 1798–1801. Soldiers used a &quot;bake oven&quot; just inside the main gate and the entrance to the bomb-proof casemate for baking bread, as a chapel, and as a mess hall. The army designed the largest casemate (#1) as a barracks. The three smaller casemates were used for storage. The architects intended Casemate #5, about half the size of Casemate #1, as the headquarters of Fort Mifflin in the time of attack.

The army built the blacksmith shop before 1802; it is probably the oldest surviving complete structure at Fort Mifflin. In 1814, a two-story officers&#x27; quarters, measuring by , was built.

In the 1811 annual report of the secretary of war, Fort Mifflin was described as &quot;...mounting 29 heavy guns, with a water battery without (outside) the works, mounting 8 heavy guns... with brick barracks for 100; within 3/4 of a mile... (is) the Lazaretto, which are good barracks for 400 men.&quot;

===Pre-Civil War period===
The U.S. Army built a one-story brick structure, by , in 1815–1816 as a guardhouse and prison. Around 1819, north of the walls of the fort, the army also built a building used as a hospital (2nd floor) and mess hall (ground floor).

After the construction of Fort Delaware in 1820, Fort Mifflin was relegated to secondary status. During the 19th century the area around the fort was drained and filled until Mud Island connected with the western bank of the Delaware River. Nevertheless, the building and garrisoning of Fort Mifflin continued. In the early 1820s, the army began meteorological observations at the fort.

The soldiers&#x27; barracks building was extensively renovated in 1836, along with the officers&#x27; quarters. At a later date the soldiers&#x27; barracks was again renovated, at which time the roofline was changed to add the second floor. (HABS # PA-1225E). In 1837, the hospital and mess hall building was converted to a meetinghouse and an artillery shed, for the storage and protection of cannon, was built on an interior raised platform.

By 1839, the army designated the one-story brick guardhouse-prison as an arsenal. On December 27, 1842 the army completed a brick, one-story sutler building/storehouse measuring by .

During the 1840s, a two-story kitchen wing was added to the officers&#x27; quarters building.

===American Civil War===
During the Civil War, the Union used Fort Mifflin to house Confederate prisoners of war, as well as Union soldiers and civilian prisoners. Numerous Confederate prisoners occupied Fort Mifflin from 1863 to 1865 and were housed in Casemate #1. The Union Army used three smaller casemates to hold political prisoners during the same period. Various people wrote graffiti inside the cell doors and on the inner walls of &quot;Casement #11&quot; during the 1860s. They also left a wine token and penny, both dated 1864 and in remarkable condition.

The Union Army accused William Howe, one of its soldiers, of desertion, found him guilty of murder, and imprisoned him famously at Fort Mifflin from January 1864. Howe led an attempted escape of two hundred prisoners from Casemate #5 in February 1864. Afterwards, Howe was housed in a solitary confinement cell in Casemate #11, where he left his signature. Despite his illiterate reputation, Howe twice wrote letters (filled with bad grammar and run-on sentences) to President Abraham Lincoln asking for clemency, signing them with his own hand. In April 1864, Howe was transferred to Eastern State Penitentiary but, on 26 August of the same year, was transferred back to Fort Mifflin. The condemned prisoner was briefly held in the fort&#x27;s wooden guardhouse prior to his execution on the gallows, which were steps away from the guardhouse. Howe&#x27;s hanging was before an audience of persons who paid for tickets to watch the execution. Of the three other men executed at Fort Mifflin, none had a paid public audience.

The army proposed adding a sally port on the west side in 1864.

On November 24, 1864, the Union Army sent Lieutenant Colonel Seth Eastman, the American Western frontier painter, to Fort Mifflin to supervise the discharge of all civilian and military prisoners, then numbering more than two hundred. On January 2, 1865, Eastman reported that his garrison consisted of B Company, 186th Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment, a detachment of recruits, and the hospital staff.

===After the Civil War===
On August 20, 1865, Captain Thomas E. Merritt with A Company, 7th United States Veteran Volunteers, relieved Lieutenant Colonel Eastman. The army completed the west sally port by 1866. In 1866, the 7th USVV vacated the fort and the District Engineer Office, Corps of Engineers, replaced the company. The fort passed in and out of use several times in its subsequent history.

Between 1866 and 1876, the Corps of Engineers intermittently repaired and modernized Fort Mifflin and upgraded its armament. The army worked on the detached high battery south of the fort from 1870 to 1875 but never finished it. The army built a torpedo (underwater mine) casemate in 1874–1875; its entrance sealed off access to the unused magazine, &quot;Casemate #11&quot;, preserving a trove of historical artifacts. These artifacts include pottery, a tin cup, a tin chamber pot, period buttons, and dozens of animal bones. The 1875 Annual Report, &quot;The construction of the torpedo casemate has commenced,&quot; notes the east magazine torpedo casemate. The army constructed this casemate in 1876.

From 1876 to 1884, the Philadelphia District Office of the Corps of Engineers took custodial responsibility of Fort Mifflin. The east magazine (torpedo casemate) first appears on a map in 1886. During World War I the fort was used to store munitions.

The army removed the two-story kitchen wings from the officers&#x27; quarters building sometime before the 1920s. They were restored in the early 1990s in a major restoration of the building.

In 1923, the Marine Barracks held the first recorded USMC Birthday dance.

===World War II===
During World War II, the U.S. Army stationed anti-aircraft guns at Fort Mifflin to defend the nearby Fort Mifflin Naval Ammunition Storage Depot (NASD) and the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Marine Corps units from the naval shipyard guarded the Naval Ammunition Storage Depot at the northern end of the former Mud and Cabin Islands, and the U.S. Army assigned troops to defend the fort. In April 1942, the U.S. Army stationed Battery H of the 76th Coast Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft) (Semimobile) (Colored), the first African-American Coast Artillery unit in U.S. military history, at the fort. On May 24, 1942, the 76th Regiment was relieved and moved to California to prepare for overseas deployment; the U.S. Army then stationed the 601st Coast Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft) (Semimobile) at Fort Mifflin.

===Post-war renovations===
In 1954, Fort Mifflin was decommissioned as an active military post. Several documents reference an old magazine entrance in the location of Casemate #11, and the number 11 comes from a 1954 map associated with the old magazine entrance. Fort Mifflin closed, ranking among the oldest forts in continuous use in the nation&#x27;s history. The fort&#x27;s interior was renovated in 1960. In the 1980s, Harold Finigan, then executive director of the fort, renovated its exterior.

==Decommissioning and restoration==

In 1962, the federal government deeded Fort Mifflin to the City of Philadelphia. In 1969, architect John Dickey was responsible for restoring the Blacksmith Shop&#x27;s bellows and forge.

Fort Mifflin is still an active base for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and is currently the oldest active U.S. military base and the only base in use that predates the Declaration of Independence.

In the late 1970s, the Commandant&#x27;s House at the Fort was destroyed by an accidental fire started by camping Boy Scouts.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Harold Finigan, the fort&#x27;s executive director, worked with architects John Dickey and John Milner to restore the fort&#x27;s artillery shed, hospital, mess hall, officers&#x27; quarters, kitchen wings, arsenal, soldiers&#x27; barracks, and north and west sally ports and seawall, and to construct a bridge over the moat at the fort&#x27;s main gate. During restoration, it was determined that the exterior of the buildings had been yellow washed during Civil War era.

In 2006, Wayne Irby rediscovered and unearthed the recently named Casemate #11 at Fort Mifflin. In August 2006, Dr. Don Johnson and a small group of volunteers uncovered and rediscovered the complexity of the fort&#x27;s inner rooms and a trove of historical artifacts inside Casemate #11.

<text>Friedrich Carl Wallau (August 8, 1823 – July 7, 1877 in Mainz). Being a printer, Carl Wallau in 1844 founded his printing plant, the &quot;Graphische Kunstanstalt&quot; in Mainz. On June 7, 1872, Wallau was elected mayor of the city of Mainz. In honor of his achievements for the Mainz city expansion, on March 1, 1877, he was appointed lord mayor of Mainz, a position he held until his death in 1877.

Carl Wallau was member of numberless associations and societies which include the &quot;Mainz Workers&#x27; Education Society&quot; that he co-founded in 1848 and which was later to become today&#x27;s Mainz adult education center. In 1872, he was President of the Mainz Carnival Association (Mainzer Carneval-Verein).

A street in Mainz has been named after Carl Wallau in 1895, the Wallaustraße. It is located in the Mainz &quot;Neustadt&quot;, the former &quot;Gartenfeld&quot; which was subject to the Mainz city expansion.

<doc id="1095155" wikidata="Q1971867" url="?curid=1095155" title="Johann Heinrich Alting">
<text>Johann Heinrich Alting (17 February 1583 – 25 August 1644), German divine, was born at Emden, where his father, Menso Alting (1541–1612), was minister.

Heinrich studied with great success at the University of Groningen and the Herborn Academy. In 1608 he was appointed tutor of Frederick, afterwards elector-palatine, at Heidelberg, and in 1612 accompanied him to England. Returning in 1613 to Heidelberg, after the marriage of the elector with Princess Elizabeth of England, he was appointed professor of dogmatics, and in 1616 director of the theological department in the Collegium Sapientiae.

In 1618, along with Abraham Scultetus, he represented the university in the Synod of Dort. When Count Tilly took the city of Heidelberg (1622) and handed it over to plunder, Alting found great difficulty in escaping the fury of the soldiers. He first retired to Schorndorf; but, offended by the &quot;semi-Pelagianism&quot; of the Lutherans with whom he was brought in contact, he removed to Holland, where the unfortunate elector and &quot;Winter King&quot; Frederick, in exile after his brief reign in Bohemia, made him tutor to his eldest son.

In 1627, Alting was appointed to the chair of theology at the Groningen University, where he continued to lecture, with increasing reputation, until his death. Though an orthodox Calvinist, Alting laid little stress on the sterner side of his creed and, when at Dort he opposed the Remonstrants, he did so mainly on the ground that they were &quot;innovators.&quot;

Alting made a fundamental contribution to the historiography of German Reformed Protestantism with his &quot;Historia de Ecclesiis Palatinis.&quot; Unfortunately the work included the doubtful assertion that Elector Frederick the Pious jointly commissioned Zacharias Ursinus and Caspar Olevianus to compose the Heidelberg Catechism. This dual authorship thesis has been rejected by serious scholarship since the 1960s but remains common in reference works. While this attribution has been set aside, Alting&#x27;s work remains an irreplaceable source for reconstructing the history of the Reformation of the Palatinate.

Among his works are:
*&quot;Notae in Decadem Problematum Jacobi Behm&quot; (Heidelberg, 1618)
*&quot;Scripta Theologica Heidelbergensia&quot; (Amsterdam, 1662)
*&quot;Exegesis Augustanae Confessionis&quot; (Amsterdam, 1647).
*&quot;Historia de Ecclesiis Palatinis&quot; (Groningen, 1728; originally published 1644).

<text>Rope splicing in ropework is the forming of a semi-permanent joint between two ropes or two parts of the same rope by partly untwisting and then interweaving their strands. Splices can be used to form a stopper at the end of a line, to form a loop or an eye in a rope, or for joining two ropes together. Splices are preferred to knotted rope, since while a knot typically reduces the strength by 20–40%, a splice is capable of attaining a rope&#x27;s full strength. However, splicing usually results in a thickening of the line and, if subsequently removed, leaves a distortion of the rope. Most types of splices are used on three-strand rope, but some can be done on 12-strand or greater single-braided rope, as well as most double braids.

While a spliced three-strand rope&#x27;s strands are interwoven to create the splice, a braided rope&#x27;s splice is constructed by simply pulling the rope into its jacket.

==Types of splice==

*Back splice (or end splice) – A splice where the strands of the end of the rope are spliced directly back into the end without forming a loop. It is used to finish off the end of the rope to keep it from fraying. The end of the rope with the splice is about twice the thickness of the rest of the rope. With nylon and other plastic materials, the back splice is often no longer used; the rope strands are simply fused together with heat to prevent fraying.
*Cut splice (originally cunt splice) – A splice similar to the eye splice. It is typically used for light lines (e.g. the log-line) where a single splice would tend to come undone, the rope being frequently wet. It makes a very strong knot. A cut splice is a join between two ropes, made by side splicing the ends slightly apart, to make an eye in the joined rope which lies shut when the rope is taut. Its original name was bowdlerised to &quot;cut splice&quot;.
*Eye splice – A splice where the working end is spliced into the working part forming a loop.
*Ring splice – Attached the working end of a rope to a ring or clew.
*Chain splice – Attached the working end of a rope to a chain.
*Figure-eight &quot;splice&quot; knot – A splice-like bend knot used for joining two ropes.
*Horseshoe splice – A cut splice where the two sides of the loop are of unequal length.
*Long splice – A splice used to join two rope ends forming one rope the length of the total of the two ropes. The long splice, unlike most splice types, results in a splice that is only very slightly thicker than the rope without the splice, but sacrifices some of the strength of the short splice. It does this by replacing two of the strands of each rope end with those from the other, and cutting off some of the extra strands that result. The long splice allows the spliced rope to still fit through the same pulleys, which is necessary in some applications.
*Short splice – Also a splice used to join the ends of two ropes, but the short splice is more similar to the technique used in other splices and results in the spliced part being about twice as thick as the non spliced part, and has greater strength than the long splice. The short splice retains more of the rope strength than any knots that join rope ends.

Splices are often tapered to make the thicker splice blend into the rest of the line. There are two main types of tapering, the standard and the &quot;West Coast Taper&quot;. 
*Standard tapers progressively remove a portion of each remaining strand – one-third at a time is typical, resulting in a taper of two additional tucks beyond the splice – thus making each successive tuck produce a narrower splice. This is only practical with laid-lines – those made up of numerous strands laid side by side. 
*West Coast taper (or Fisherman&#x27;s taper) is effected by extra-tucks of entire strands, such that the second strand is woven one more time than the first and the third is woven an additional time after the second.

==Splicing tools==

A fid is a hand tool made from wood, plastic, or bone and is used in the process of working with rope. A variety of fid diameters are available depending on the size of rope being used. Styles of fid designs include:
*A Swedish fid is conical instrument with a somewhat long taper. 
*Tubular fids aid in splicing double-braided rope.
*Top fids are used to pull rope taut while separating strands of rope with a Swedish fid.
*Uni-fids are needed to splice braid with a parallel core.

A marlinspike is a tool, usually made of steel and often part of a sailor&#x27;s pocketknife, which is used to separate strands of rope from one another. They can range in size anywhere from to long, with a round or flattened point.

A pulling fid is often used for smaller diameters of braided ropes. Also a Softfid is a great tool when dealing with tightly braided ropes.

<doc id="1095178" wikidata="Q692115" url="?curid=1095178" title="Giovanni Diodati">
<text>Giovanni Diodati or Deodati (3 June 15763 October 1649) was a Genevan-born Italian Calvinist theologian and translator. His translation of the Bible into Italian from Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Syriac sources became the reference version used by Italian Protestants.

==Life==

He was born at Geneva, of a noble family originally from Lucca in Italy, exiled on account of its Protestantism. He considered himself an Italian &quot;di nation lucchese&quot;, of Lucchese nationality. His father was . The were part of a group of about sixty noble Luchessi families who had emigrated to Geneva, sometimes called the &quot;Italian Cabal&quot;. Between 1594 and 1597 future Amsterdam burgomaster Jacob Dircksz de Graeff lived for three years in the house of Diodati. He matriculated at the Genevan Academy in 1596. At the age of twenty-one he was nominated professor of Hebrew at Geneva on the recommendation of Theodore Beza. In 1606 he became professor of theology, in 1608 pastor, or parish minister, at Geneva, and in the following year he succeeded Beza as professor of theology.

As a preacher Diodati was eloquent, and he was sent on a mission to France in 1614. He had previously visited Italy, and made the acquaintance of Paolo Sarpi, whom he endeavoured unsuccessfully to engage in a reformation movement. In 1618/9 he attended the Synod of Dort, and took a prominent part, being one of the six divines appointed to draw up the Canons of Dort. He sympathized with the condemnation of the Arminians.

In 1645 Diodati resigned his professorship, and he died at Geneva on 3 October 1649.

==Works==

Diodati is chiefly famous as the author of the translation of the Bible into Italian (1603; edited with notes, 1607; revised and with metrical psalter, 1641). He also undertook a translation of the Bible into French, which appeared with notes in 1644. Among his other works are his &quot;Annotationes in Biblia&quot; (1607), of which an English translation (&quot;Pious and Learned Annotations upon the Holy Bible&quot;) was published in London in 1643 (2nd edition 1648) and various polemical treatises, such as &quot;De fictitio Pontificiorum Purgatorio&quot; (1619); &quot;De justa secessione Reformatorum ab Ecclesia Romana&quot; (1628); &quot;De Antichristo&quot;, etc. He also published French translations of Paolo Sarpi&#x27;s &quot;History of the Council of Trent&quot;, and of Edwin Sandys&#x27;s &quot;Account of the State of Religion in the West&quot;.

<doc id="1095179" wikidata="Q1246700" url="?curid=1095179" title="Muggletonianism">
<text>The Muggletonians, named after Lodowicke Muggleton, were a small Protestant Christian movement which began in 1651 when two London tailors announced they were the last prophets foretold in the biblical Book of Revelation. The group grew out of the Ranters and in opposition to the Quakers. Muggletonian beliefs include a hostility to philosophical reason, a scriptural understanding of how the universe works and a belief that God appeared directly on Earth as Jesus Christ. A consequential belief is that God takes no notice of everyday events on Earth and will not generally intervene until it is meant to bring the world to an end.

Muggletonians avoided all forms of worship or preaching, and met only for discussion and socializing. The movement was egalitarian, apolitical and pacifist, and resolutely avoided evangelism. Members attained a degree of public notoriety by cursing those who reviled their faith. This practice ceased in the mid-nineteenth century. One of the last to be cursed was the novelist Sir Walter Scott.

The faith attracted public attention in 1979 when Philip Noakes left the entire Muggletonian archive of correspondence, general papers and publications to the British Library.

== Origins ==
The movement was born on 3 February 1651 (old style) when a London tailor, John Reeve, claimed to receive a commission from God &quot;to the hearing of the ear as a man speaks to a friend.&quot; Reeve was told four things:
* &quot;I have given thee understanding of my mind in the Scriptures above all men in the world.&quot;
*&quot;Look into thy own body, there thou shalt see the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Kingdom of Hell.&quot;
* &quot;I have chosen thee a last messenger for a great work, unto this bloody unbelieving world. And I have given thee Lodowick Muggleton to be thy mouth.&quot;
* &quot;I have put the two-edged sword of my spirit into thy mouth, that whoever I pronounce blessed, through thy mouth, is blessed to eternity; and whoever I pronounce cursed through thy mouth is cursed to eternity.&quot;
Reeve believed that he and his cousin, Lodowicke Muggleton, were the two witnesses spoken of in the third verse of the eleventh chapter of the Book of Revelation. After Reeve&#x27;s death, Muggleton had a brief struggle for control of the group with Laurence Clarkson, a former Ranter, and subsequently with those followers of John Reeve who did not accept Muggleton&#x27;s authority.

The Muggletonians emphasized the Millennium and the Second Coming of Christ, and believed, among other things, that the soul is mortal; that Jesus is God (and not a member of a Trinity); that when Jesus died there was no God in Heaven, and Moses and Elijah looked after Heaven until Jesus&#x27; resurrection; that Heaven is six miles above Earth; that God is between five and six feet tall; and that any external religious ceremony is not necessary. Some scholars think that Muggletonian doctrine may have influenced the work of the artist and poet William Blake.

Recent attempts have been made to locate the movement within earlier intellectual traditions, most notably the Eternal Gospel of Joachim of Fiore. However, Dr Marjorie Reeves has examined the evidence and concludes &quot;the case for a recognisable Joachimist influence among seventeenth-century English prophets falls to the ground.&quot; There had been at least one earlier appearance of a claim about the Two Last Witnesses, which John Reeve knew about.

== Beliefs ==
The six principles of Muggletonianism were perhaps best set out by George Williamson, a Roman Catholic who visited the London Muggletonians in 1913: 
* There is no God but the glorified Man Christ Jesus.
* There is no Devil but the unclean Reason of men.
* Heaven is an infinite abode of light above and beyond the stars.
* The place of Hell will be this Earth when sun, moon and stars are extinguished.
* Angels are the only beings of Pure Reason.
* The Soul dies with the body and will be raised with it.

These principles derive from Lodowicke Muggleton, who would have added one other matter as being of equal importance, namely, that God takes no immediate notice of doings in this world. If people sin, it is against their own consciences and not because God &quot;catches them at it&quot;.

John Reeve&#x27;s formulation also included pacifism and the doctrine of the two seeds (see below).

According to Rev Dr Alexander Gordon of Belfast, &quot;The system of belief is a singular union of opinions which seem diametrically opposed. It is rationalistic on one side, credulous on another.&quot;

Muggletonianism was profoundly materialist. Matter pre-existed even the creation of our universe; nothing can be created from nothing. God, identified as the Holy One of Israel, is a being with a glorified body, in appearance much like a man. There can never be a spirit without a body. A purely spiritual deity, lacking any locus, would be an absurdity (so Muggletonians vehemently told the Quakers) incapable of action in a material world. The man Christ Jesus was not sent from God but was the very God appearing on this earth. Speculation about a divine nature and a human nature, or about the Trinity, is not in error so much as unnecessary. At worst, John Reeve said, it encourages people to ascribe to the deity a whole ragbag of inconsistent human attributes expressed as superlatives. Or, as Thomas Tomkinson drily remarked, it tends to give you a father of justice just when you most wanted a son of mercy.

 The Devil, on the other hand, should not be likened to a character from a Ben Jonson play. When the one reprobate angel was tossed from heaven to earth, he perished, but not before impregnating Eve so that Cain was born to perpetuate his frustrated rage upon this earth. The natural process of generation ensured that, even by the time of Noah, all humans had within themselves something from Seth and something from Cain. Muggletonians call this the doctrine of the two seeds: the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. The former promoted faith within us, the latter promoted reasoning and desire. This is the conflict within every person. This is a predestinarian belief but, because there are two seeds and not one, humanity is not rendered abject and the innocence of Adam and Eve still has a chance of coming to the top within modern humankind.

Reason stems from desire and lack. Reason is not seen as a sublime mental process but as a rather shoddy trick humans use to try to get what they misguidedly imagine they want. Angels are creatures of Pure Reason because their only desire is for God so that their lack will be totally satisfied over and over again. The reprobate angel was not at fault. God deliberately chose to deprive this angel of satisfaction so that, by his fall, the other angels would become aware that their perfection came from God and not from their own natures.

Professor William M. Lamont sees 17th-century Muggletonianism as an early form of liberation theology. Because there are no spirits without bodies, there can be no ghosts, no witches, no grounds for fear and superstition and no all-seeing eye of God. Once persons are contented in their faith, they are free to speculate as they please on all other matters. God will take no notice. And Muggletonian meetings did just that.

The Muggletonian canon is generally taken to comprise:
*The books of the Christian Old &amp; New Testaments except those traditionally ascribed to Solomon, whose wisdom is seen as worldly rather than inspired. Crucially, this deletes Ecclesiastes. Muggleton expressed doubts about the Book of Job but it is too much of a favourite to remove. Thomas Tomkinson advances a neat compromise, &quot;though the authority of the book is questioned by some, yet all admit it to be a true history.&quot;
*The writings of the prophets of the Third Commission: &quot;A Transcendent Spiritual Treatise&quot; (1st Ed. 1652), &quot;A Divine Looking-Glass&quot; (1st ed, 1656) and other works 
*The Book of Enoch (Ethiopic Enoch or 1 Enoch). Muggletonians did not produce their own edition but did reprint &quot;Signification of the proper names occurring in the Book of Enoch from the Hebrew &amp; Chaldee&quot; Rev D. A. De Sola. Finsbury: Isaac Frost (1852). Similarly, &quot;The Book of the Secrets of Enoch&quot; (Slavonic Enoch or 2 Enoch) which was introduced into English by Robert Henry Charles in 1896 would qualify.
*&quot;The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs&quot;, from an English version of Robert Grosseteste&#x27;s 13th-century Latin translation, printed from the 1693 edition with its introduction plus a modern glossary. Whitechapel: Joseph Frost Snr (1837).
However, Muggletonians had a distaste for scriptural literalism. One of the purposes of the third commission was to make clear what was previously held obscure in scripture. Their approach to scripture incorporated quite explicit interpretation and separated texts into positive and privative.

== Muggletonian meetings ==
Professor Lamont styles the Muggletonians &quot;disorganized religion&quot;. They held no annual conferences, never organised a single public meeting, seem to have escaped every official register or census of religion, never incorporated, never instituted a friendly society, never appointed a leader, spokesperson, editorial board, chairperson for meetings or a single committee. Their sole foray into bureaucracy was to appoint trustees for their investment, the income from which paid the rent on the London Reading Room between 1869 and 1918. Philip Noakes may not have been the last Muggletonian, but he was certainly the last trustee.

Muggletonian meetings were simple comings-together of individuals who appeared to feel that discussion with like-minded believers helped clarify their own thoughts. &quot;Nothing in the Muggletonian history becomes it more than its fidelity to open debate (though sometimes rancorous).&quot;

Records and correspondence show that meetings took place from the 1650s to 1940 in London and for almost as long in Derbyshire. Regular meetings occurred at other places at other times. Bristol, Cork, Faversham and Nottingham are among those known, and there were many others, especially in East Anglia and Kent.

In both London and Derbyshire, two types of meetings were held. There were regular discussion meetings and there were holiday meetings of a more celebratory nature held in mid-February (to commemorate the start of the Third Commission) and at the end of July (to remember Muggleton&#x27;s release from imprisonment).

There remains a description of a Muggletonian holiday meeting held at the Reading Room at 7 New Street, London on 14 February 1869. There were about 40 members present, of whom slightly more than half were men. One-quarter were said to have been born into the faith. Tea was served at 5 o&#x27;clock. Discussion continued until 6 when a lady sang &quot;Arise, My Soul, Arise&quot; one of the Muggletonian divine songs. Then a large bowl of port negus with slices of lemon was served and a toast enjoined to absent friends. More songs were sung by each who volunteered. Beer was brought in and supper was served at half past eight. &quot;It was a plain substantial meal; consisting of a round of beef, a ham, cheese, butter, bread and beer. Throughout the evening, every one seemed heartily to enjoy himself or herself, with no lack of friendliness, but with complete decorum.&quot; No speeches were made. &quot;By ten o&#x27;clock all were on their way homeward.&quot; About 30 Muggletonians enjoyed at least one seaside outing to Hastings after the First World War.

There is also an account for a far older holiday meeting which Lodowicke Muggleton and his daughter, Sarah, attended in July 1682 at the Green Man pub in Holloway, then a popular rural retreat to the north of London. In addition to a goodly meal with wine and beer, a quartern of tobacco, one-fifth of a pound, was gotten through and a shilling paid out to &quot;ye man of the bowling green&quot;.

Outside of holiday times, meetings seem to have altered little with time and place. They comprised discussion, readings and songs. There was no public worship, no instruction, no prayer. There is no record of any participant being moved by the spirit. Until mid-Victorian times, London meetings were held in the back rooms of pubs. In the early days, this is said to have provided an appearance of outward conformity with the Conventicle Acts 1664 and 1667. The meeting would look and sound to outsiders like a private or family party. Nothing would advertise religious observance. By 1869, pub life had become irksome and the London congregation obtained their first Reading Room at 7 New Street, which was reckoned to be built on the former site of Lodowicke Muggleton&#x27;s birthplace, Walnut Tree Yard. This was made possible by legacies from Catherine Peers, Joseph Gandar and the Frost family; all of whom had been active in the faith. The money invested in government stock yielded sufficient income to pay the rent and the wages of a live-in caretaker who, for most of the Victorian period, was an unemployed shoe-repairer named Thomas Robinson. 7 New Street is perhaps the only site with Muggletonian connections still extant. However, it may require considerable historical imagination from the modern passer-by to gain a mental picture of what it would have been like in Victorian times. Then, the area was full of warehouses and factories, not the smart, professional consultancies of today. For his visit in 1913, Williamson tellingly describes it as being &quot;in the East End&quot;.

By May 1918, wartime inflation seems to have undermined the Victorian financial settlement. The Muggletonians moved to cheaper rented premises not far away at 74 Worship Street, to the north of Finsbury Square. They remained there until probably the autumn of 1940 when the building was destroyed by a firebomb during the London Blitz. This was the event which led to the transfer of the Muggletonian archive to Mr Noakes&#x27;s farm in Kent. As a fruit farmer, Mr Noakes received a petrol ration to take his produce to Covent Garden market in central London. On the return journey, the archive was packed into empty boxes and taken to safety.

==The Two Witnesses==
John Reeve reports that only he was told of his Commission by the word of God. Yet two persons, Lodowicke Muggleton and John Reeve, are appointed the Last Witnesses to fulfil the prophecy of Revelation 11:3 where no distinction is drawn between one witness and the other. John Reeve introduces a distinction of his own. &quot;And I have given thee Lodowicke Muggleton to be thy mouth: at that very moment the holy spirit brought into my mind that scripture of Aaron given unto Moses.&quot; Whilst Reeve was alive, we have no evidence that anyone took Lodowicke Muggleton very seriously except as Reeve&#x27;s assistant. At their blasphemy trial in 1653, The Recorder of London, after examining John Reeve, turns to Muggleton and says, &quot;Let Aaron speak&quot;. Certainly, Muggleton appears to have written nothing whilst Reeve was alive. After first attempting to take control, Clarkson eventually submitted to Muggleton completely, even agreeing to give up writing and keeping that promise.

Revelation say the Two Witnesses:
*Possess power and to prophesy 1260 days whilst clothed in sackcloth.
*Are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks.
*Will kill their enemies by fire from their mouths.
*Can inflict droughts and plagues and turn water to blood during their prophesying.
*Shall be killed by the Beast and their bodies lie unburied in the street of a great city for three and a half days whilst the people will rejoice &quot;because these two prophets tormented them&quot;.
*Will return to life and ascend to heaven whilst an earthquake destroys one tenth of the city. With that &quot;the Second Woe is past and behold the Third Woe cometh quickly&quot;.

Muggleton and Reeve&#x27;s two predecessors, the weavers Richard Farnham and John Bull, did try to live out their script, particularly in their role as bringers of plagues. However, there is no evidence that John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton felt in any way obliged to follow suit. Contemporaries did comment adversely upon this, especially upon the death of Reeve from all-too-natural causes followed by his equally mundane funeral at the New Bethlehem Burial grounds.

== Later history ==
The Muggletonians had a belief that they could damn and bless according to the will of God and the apparent success of such damning (apparently resulting in the death of certain religious, mainly Quaker, opponents) brought the sect great notoriety. A vigorous tract war ensued with their Quaker opponents that lasted until the death of Muggleton.

William Maitland&#x27;s 1739 edition of &quot;A History of London&quot; gives two Muggletonian meeting-places. One, for the Southwark congregation, is in Barnaby Street. The other, for the Aldersgate congregation, is in Old Street Square. Presumably, both of these were public houses, rented rooms or private homes as no dedicated meeting room existed before 1869.

In &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot; E. P. Thompson says, &quot;The Muggletonians (or followers of Ludovic Muggleton) were still preaching in the fields and parks of London at the end of the eighteenth century.&quot; Those Muggletons whose lives we know about would have rejected preaching as pointless and spiritually dangerous. Were there other groups of Muggletonians who operated differently? At present, historians cannot answer, but the possibility is there. Firstly, other denominations of that era, such as Methodists and Baptists, existed in a profusion of forms as E. P. Thompson&#x27;s own index shows. Secondly, contact between those Muggletonians about whom we do know was sporadic, at best. &quot;For example, those in Derbyshire were ignorant of the existence of any persons entertaining the same faith in London until one of their number removed thither to seek employment and, after residing there a short time, heard of the London bretheren by mere accident.&quot; Thirdly, the name existed widely in the public domain without much knowledge of what it meant. Sir Walter Scott received eternal damnation for his ignorant remarks in &quot;Woodstock&quot;. Charles Dickens incorporates All-Muggleton into &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;. A character called Mrs Snowdrop in Douglas William Jerrold&#x27;s &quot;Nell Gwynne&quot; (1833) says, &quot;Nothing now will serve her but to go upon the stage. Tisn&#x27;t my fault. I&#x27;m sure I put the pious Mr Muggleton under her pillow every night.&quot;

During the nineteenth century, this formerly non-proselytizing Protestant sect became increasingly vocal and published several books intended for general audiences. In 1846, for example, the Muggletonian Isaac Frost published &quot;Two Systems of Astronomy&quot;, a lavishly illustrated book outlining the anti-Newtonian cosmology of the Muggletonians. This activity arose from the activity of the Frost brothers (Joseph and Isaac) who, having made their fortune in the Derby Brass Foundry business, proceeded to spend significant sums on publicising their sect once the family moved to London. A great number of books were published but very few were actually sold.

Notable Muggletonian writers include Laurence Clarkson (1615–1667) an itinerant preacher born in Preston, Lancashire; John Saddington (1634? – 1679) a London sugar merchant, originally from Arnesby, Leicestershire; Thomas Tomkinson (1631–1710) a Staffordshire yeoman farmer who moved to London in the 1680s; Arden Bonell (b.? – 1746) a London Barber-Surgeon; and Isaac Frost (1793–1858) and Joseph Frost (1791–1857), brothers who ran the family metallurgy business in Clerkenwell, London. Also deserving mention is Alexander Delamaine (died 1687), a wealthy London tobacco merchant who began &quot;The Great Book&quot; in 1682, which became the Muggletonian archive. Thomas Robinson (see above) in opposition to the Frost brothers strongly preferred the 1656 edition of &quot;A Divine Looking-Glass&quot; to Muggleton&#x27;s revision of 1661 and also wrote an unpublished manuscript Upon New Thoughts circulated to Muggletonians which argues for a God in an infinite universe.

The group survived into the twentieth century. The last Muggletonian, Philip Noakes of Matfield, Kent, died on 26 February 1979; the sect&#x27;s records, which he had kept, were then transferred to the British Library. Other gifts have joined the archive, most notably from Eileen Muggleton of the commonplace book of John Dimock Aspland (1816–1877). The published works of the Muggletonians are still available from Gage Postal Books of Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex.

There may be another archive still to be found. Mrs Louise Barnes of Buffalo, New York, wrote to London in 1936 about the US Muggletonian archive kept by her father, the late Alfred Hall. This collection was clearly treasured, mainly for family reasons. It may still exist.

Today, Muggletonian works (including their hymnal DIVINE SONGS) are reprinted (as hard copy and e-books) by the Muggletonian Press at http://muggletonianpress.com/

&quot;In Edward Thompson&#x27;s words, Muggletonianism was a &#x27;highly intellectual anti-intellectualism&#x27;, and as such remarkably well adapted for survival among the semi-educated, self-taught, self-confident London artisans of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&quot;

<text>Patricia J. Tallman (born September 4, 1957) is an American actress, stunt performer, and studio executive best known for her roles in &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. She is the former CEO and executive producer of Studio JMS.

== Early life and education ==
Patricia Tallman is the daughter of Jerry Tallman, a radio entertainer. After graduating from Glenbard West High School in Glen Ellyn, Illinois in 1975, she joined the theater arts program of Carnegie Mellon University, which awarded her a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.

== Career ==
In television, Tallman worked on the soap opera &quot;Generations&quot;. Later, she had guest-starring roles on &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, as well as the science-fiction shows &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. As an actress and stunt performer, she worked on 50 episodes across the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Tallman played Lyta Alexander in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; series pilot, recurring in seasons two and three, and starring in seasons four and five. Tallman collaborated with fellow Carnegie Mellon alumnus George A. Romero on several films, including &quot;Knightriders&quot;, &quot;Monkey Shines&quot;, and &quot;Creepshow 2&quot; (in which Tallman performed stunts).

In 1990, Tallman starred as Barbara in the Tom Savini-directed remake of the 1968 film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. In 1992, she played the Possessed Witch under heavy make-up in the cult classic &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, as well as the Witch in the modern day scenes.

In 1993, Tallman&#x27;s most notable stunt work came as stunt double for Laura Dern throughout Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. In addition, she served as stunt double for Laurel Holloman, who portrayed vampire hunter Justine Cooper in the series &quot;Angel&quot;, a photo of Tallman was also used as the photo of Justine Cooper&#x27;s dead twin sister. In a 2001 episode of the TV series &quot;Sheena&quot;, she guest-starred as the villain Caroline Dula.

Tallman appeared in the 2002 psychological horror short, &quot;Jennifer Is Dead&quot;, the black comedy &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Wake!&quot;, and guest spots on &quot;Without a Trace&quot; and &quot;Castle&quot;. Tallman appeared in &quot;InAlienable&quot; (2008) and the horror film &quot;Dead Air&quot; (2009). Tallman played Holly in &quot;Atlas Shrugged: Part II&quot; (2012).

Tallman has performed voice roles including playing the leading part of evil detective Jean Richmond in the Radio Repertory Company of America&#x27;s production of &quot;Lives of the Cat&quot; and in some of the Anne Manx sequels (sold as radio plays on CD).

In 2011, Tallman published her autobiography &quot;Pleasure Thresholds&quot;, the title inspired by the scene she auditioned to earn the role of Lyta Alexander.

In 2012, Tallman became CEO and executive producer of Studio JMS in partnership with her then-boyfriend, J. Michael Straczynski, the creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. In 2013, she left the company.

In May 2014, Tallman played the male role of Lespere in a theatrical production of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; at Sci-Fest LA 2014, a theater festival. The following year Tallman played the wife in a comedy called &quot;A Logic Called Joe&quot; at the second Sci-Fest LA.

In 2016, Tallman started Quest Retreats, a VIP adventure excursion company with annual events in Hawaii, London, New Zealand, and South Africa.

== Personal life ==
Tallman met Andrea Rogantini when he was the executive chef at Prego Ristorante in Los Angeles. Rogantini is the father of her only child, a son named Julian Tallman. Tallman later met Jeffrey Willerth when she was acting on &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (1993–1998), where he was an associate producer. They were married in 1999, separated several years later and divorced in 2008.

Tallman met J. Michael Straczynski (JMS) when she was acting on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, a series which he created. The two entered into a relationship some time after Straczynski separated from his wife, Kathryn M. Drennan, in 2002. They separated in 2013.

Tallman married actor and writer Glenn Morrissey in 2022.

Tallman is a leading fund-raiser for Penny Lane, a center for abused children in California. , she has been leading their annual “Be a Santa Toy Drive” for more than 20 years.

<doc id="1095203" wikidata="Q654057" url="?curid=1095203" title="Tuscan order">
<text>The Tuscan order (Latin &quot;Ordo Tuscanicus&quot; or &quot;Ordo Tuscanus&quot;, with the meaning of Etruscan order) is one of the two classical orders developed by the Romans, the other being the composite order. It is influenced by the Doric order, but with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae. While relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture, the Romans did not consider this style to be a distinct architectural order (for example, the Roman architect Vitruvius did not include it alongside his descriptions of the Greek Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders). Its classification as a separate formal order is first mentioned in Isidore of Seville&#x27;s 6th-century &quot;Etymologiae&quot; and refined during the Italian Renaissance.

Sebastiano Serlio described five orders including a &quot;Tuscan order&quot;, &quot;the solidest and least ornate&quot;, in his fourth book of &quot;Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici&quot; (1537). Though Fra Giocondo had attempted a first illustration of a Tuscan capital in his printed edition of Vitruvius (1511), he showed the capital with an egg and dart enrichment that belonged to the Ionic. The &quot;most rustic&quot; Tuscan order of Serlio was later carefully delineated by Andrea Palladio.

In its simplicity, the Tuscan order is seen as similar to the Doric order, and yet in its overall proportions, intercolumniation and simpler entablature, it follows the ratios of the Ionic. This strong order was considered most appropriate in military architecture and in docks and warehouses when they were dignified by architectural treatment. Serlio found it &quot;suitable to fortified places, such as city gates, fortresses, castles, treasuries, or where artillery and ammunition are kept, prisons, seaports and other similar structures used in war.&quot;

==Italian writers on architecture==
From the perspective of these writers, the Tuscan order was an older primitive Italic architectural form, predating the Greek Doric and Ionic, associated by Serlio with the practice of rustication and the architectural practice of Tuscany. Giorgio Vasari made a valid argument for this claim by reference to Il Cronaca&#x27;s graduated rustication on the facade of Palazzo Strozzi, Florence. Like all architectural theory of the Renaissance, precedents for a Tuscan order were sought for in Vitruvius, who does not include it among the three canonic orders, but peripherally, in his discussion of the Etruscan temple (book iv, 7.2–3). Later Roman practice ignored the Tuscan order, and so did Leon Battista Alberti in &quot;De re aedificatoria&quot; (shortly before 1452).

Following Serlio&#x27;s interpretation of Vitruvius (who gives no indication of the column&#x27;s capital), in the Tuscan order the column had a simpler base—circular rather than squared as in the other orders, where Vitruvius was being followed—and with a simple torus and collar, and the column was unfluted, while both capital and entablature were without adornments. The modular proportion of the column was 1:7 in Vitruvius, and in Palladio&#x27;s illustration for Daniele Barbaro&#x27;s commentary on Vitruvius), in Vignola&#x27;s &quot;Cinque ordini d&#x27;architettura&quot; (1562), and in Palladio&#x27;s &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (1570). Serlio alone gives a stockier proportion of 1:6. A plain astragal or taenia ringed the column beneath its plain cap.

Palladio agreed in essence with Serlio: 
The Tuscan, being rough, is rarely used above ground except in one-storey buildings like villa barns or in huge structures like Amphitheatres and the like which, having many orders, can take this one in place of the Doric, under the Ionic.

Unlike the other authors Palladio found Roman precedents, of which he named the arena of Verona and the Pula Arena, both of which, James Ackerman points out, are arcuated buildings that did not present columns and entablatures. A striking feature is his rusticated frieze resting upon a perfectly plain entablature

Examples of the use of the order are the Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne in Rome, by Baldassarre Peruzzi, 1532–1536, and the pronaos portico to Santa Maria della Pace added by Pietro da Cortona (1656–1667).

==Later spread==
A relatively rare church in the Tuscan order is St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden by Inigo Jones (1633). According to an often repeated story, recorded by Horace Walpole, Lord Bedford gave Jones a very low budget and asked him for a simple church &quot;not much better than a barn&quot;, to which the architect replied &quot;Then you shall have the handsomest barn in England&quot;. Christ Church, Spitalfields in London (1714–29) by Nicholas Hawksmoor, uses it outside, and Corinthian within.

In a typical usage, at the very grand Palladian house of Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, which is mainly Corinthian, the stable court of 1768 uses Tuscan. Another English house, West Wycombe Park, has a loggia facade in two storeys with Tuscan on the ground floor and Corinthian above. This recalls Palladio&#x27;s Palazzo Chiericati, which uses Ionic over Doric.

The Neue Wache is a Greek Revival guardhouse in Berlin, by Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1816). Though in most respects the Greek temple frontage is a careful exercise in revivalism, there are minimal plain bases to the thick fluted columns and, despite having metope reliefs and a large group of sculpture in the pediment, there are no triglyphs or guttae. Nonetheless, despite these &quot;Tuscan&quot; aspects, the overall impression is strongly Greek and it is rightly always described as &quot;Doric&quot;.

Tuscan is often used for doorways and other entrances where only a pair of columns are required, and using another order might seem pretentious. Because the Tuscan mode is easily worked up by a carpenter with a few planing tools, it became part of the vernacular Georgian style that lingered in places like New England and Ohio deep into the 19th century. In gardening, &quot;carpenter&#x27;s Doric&quot; which is Tuscan, provides simple elegance to gate posts and fences in many traditional garden contexts.

<doc id="1095208" wikidata="Q5732811" url="?curid=1095208" title="Trip generation">
<text>Trip generation is the first step in the conventional four-step transportation forecasting process used for forecasting travel demands. It predicts the number of trips originating in or destined for a particular traffic analysis zone (TAZ).
Trip generation analysis focuses on residences and residential trip generation is thought of as a function of the social and economic attributes of households. At the level of the traffic analysis zone, residential land uses &quot;produce&quot; or generate trips. Traffic analysis zones are also destinations of trips, trip attractors. The analysis of attractors focuses on non-residential land uses.

This process is followed by trip distribution, mode choice, and route assignment.

==Input data==
A forecasting activity, such as one based on the concept of economic base analysis, provides aggregate measures of population and activity growth. Land use forecasting distributes forecast changes in activities in a disaggregate-spatial manner among zones. The next step in the transportation planning process addresses the question of the frequency of origins and destinations of trips in each zone: for short, trip generation.

==Analysis==

===Initial analysis===
The first zonal trip generation (and its inverse, attraction) analysis in the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) followed the “decay of activity intensity with distance from the central business district (CBD)” thinking current at the time. Data from extensive surveys were arrayed and interpreted on a distance-from-CBD scale. For example, commercial land use in ring 0 (the CBD and vicinity) was found to generate 728 vehicle trips per day in 1956. That same land use in ring 5 (about from the CBD) generated about 150 trips per day.

The case of trip destinations will illustrate use of the concept of activity decline with intensity (as measured by distance from CBD) worked. Destination data are arrayed:

The land use analysis provides information on how land uses will change from an initial year (say t = 0) to some forecast year (say t = 20). Suppose we are examining a zone. We take the mix of land uses projected, say, for year t = 20 and apply the trip destination rates for the ring in which the zone is located. That is, there will this many acres of commercial land use, that many acres of public open space, etc., in the zone. The acres of each use type are multiplied by the ring specific destination rates. The result is summed to yield the zone’s trip destinations. The CATS assumed that trip destination rates would not change over time.

===Revisions to the analysis===
As was true for land use analysis, the approach developed at CATS was considerably modified in later studies. The conventional four-step paradigm evolved as follows: Types of trips are considered. Home-based (residential) trips are divided into work and other, with major attention given to work trips. Movement associated with the home end of a trip is called trip production, whether the trip is leaving or coming to the home. Non-home-based or non-residential trips are those a home base is not involved. In this case, the term production is given to the origin of a trip and the term attraction refers to the destination of the trip.

Residential trip generation analysis is often undertaken using statistical regression. Person, transit, walking, and auto trips per unit of time are regressed on variables thought to be explanatory, such as: household size, number of workers in the household, persons in an age group, type of residence (single family, apartment, etc.), and so on. Usually, measures on five to seven independent variables are available; additive causality is assumed.

Regressions are also made at the aggregate/zone level. Variability among households within a zone isn’t measured when data are aggregated. High correlation coefficients are found when regressions are run on aggregate data, about 0.90, but lower coefficients, about 0.25, are found when regressions are made on observation units such as households. In short, there is much variability that is hidden by aggregation.

Sometimes cross-classification techniques are applied to residential trip generation problems. The CATS procedure described above is a cross-classification procedure.

Classification techniques are often used for non-residential trip generation. First, the type of land use is a factor influencing travel, it is regarded as a causal factor. A list of land uses and associated trip rates illustrated a simple version of the use of this technique:

Such a list can be improved by adding information. Large, medium, and small might be defined for each activity and rates given by size. Number of employees might be used: for example, &lt;10, 10-20, etc. Also, floor space is used to refine estimates.

In other cases, regressions, usually of the form
trip rate = f(number of employees, floor area of establishment),
are made for land use types.

Special treatment is often given major trip generators: large shopping centers, airports, large manufacturing plants, and recreation facilities.

The theoretical work related to trip generation analysis is grouped under the rubric travel demand theory, which treats trip generation-attraction, as well as mode choice, route selection, and other topics.

==Databases==
The Institute of Transportation Engineers&#x27;s &quot;Trip Generation Manual&quot; provides trip generation rates for various land use and building types. The planner can add local adjustment factors and treat mixes of uses with ease. Ongoing work is adding to the stockpile of numbers; over 4000 studies were aggregated for the latest edition.

ITE Procedures estimate the number of trips entering and exiting a site at a given time. ITE Rates are functions of type of development based on independent variables such as square footage of the gross leasable area, number of gas pumps, number of dwelling units, or other standard measurable things, usually produced in site plans. They are typically of the form formula_1 or formula_2. They do not consider location, competitors, complements, the cost of transportation, or other factors. The trip generation estimates are provided through data analysis. Many localities require their use to ensure adequate public facilities for growth management and subdivision approval.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the TRICS database is commonly used to calculate trip generation.

<text>Boron carbide (chemical formula approximately B4C) is an extremely hard boron–carbon ceramic, a covalent material used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, engine sabotage powders,
as well as numerous industrial applications. With a Vickers hardness of &gt;30 GPa, it is one of the hardest known materials, behind cubic boron nitride and diamond.

== History==
Boron carbide was discovered in the 19th century as a by-product of reactions involving metal borides, but its chemical formula was unknown. It was not until the 1930s that the chemical composition was estimated as B4C.
Controversy remained as to whether or not the material had this exact 4:1 stoichiometry, as, in practice the material is always slightly carbon-deficient with regard to this formula, and X-ray crystallography shows that its structure is highly complex, with a mixture of C-B-C chains and B12 icosahedra.
These features argued against a very simple exact B4C empirical formula.
Because of the B12 structural unit, the chemical formula of &quot;ideal&quot; boron carbide is often written not as B4C, but as B12C3, and the carbon deficiency of boron carbide described in terms of a combination of the B12C3 and B12CBC units.

== Crystal structure ==

Boron carbide has a complex crystal structure typical of icosahedron-based borides. There, B12 icosahedra form a rhombohedral lattice unit (space group: &quot;Rm&quot; (No. 166), lattice constants: &quot;a&quot; = 0.56 nm and &quot;c&quot; = 1.212 nm) surrounding a C-B-C chain that resides at the center of the unit cell, and both carbon atoms bridge the neighboring three icosahedra. This structure is layered: the B12 icosahedra and bridging carbons form a network plane that spreads parallel to the &quot;c&quot;-plane and stacks along the &quot;c&quot;-axis. The lattice has two basic structure units – the B12 icosahedron and the B6 octahedron. Because of the small size of the B6 octahedra, they cannot interconnect. Instead, they bond to the B12 icosahedra in the neighboring layer, and this decreases bonding strength in the &quot;c&quot;-plane.

Because of the B12 structural unit, the chemical formula of &quot;ideal&quot; boron carbide is often written not as B4C, but as B12C3, and the carbon deficiency of boron carbide described in terms of a combination of the B12C3 and B12C2 units. Some studies indicate the possibility of incorporation of one or more carbon atoms into the boron icosahedra, giving rise to formulas such as (B11C)CBC = B4C at the carbon-heavy end of the stoichiometry, but formulas such as B12(CBB) = B14C at the boron-rich end. &quot;Boron carbide&quot; is thus not a single compound, but a family of compounds of different compositions. A common intermediate, which approximates a commonly found ratio of elements, is B12(CBC) = B6.5C. Quantum mechanical calculations have demonstrated that configurational disorder between boron and carbon atoms on the different positions in the crystal determines several of the materials properties – in particular, the crystal symmetry of the B4C composition and the non-metallic electrical character of the B13C2 composition.

==Properties==
Boron carbide is known as a robust material having extremely high hardness (about 9.5 up to 9.75 on Mohs hardness scale), high cross section for absorption of neutrons (i.e. good shielding properties against neutrons), stability to ionizing radiation and most chemicals. Its Vickers hardness (38 GPa), elastic modulus (460 GPa) and fracture toughness (3.5 MPa·m1/2) approach the corresponding values for diamond (1150 GPa and 5.3 MPa·m1/2).

, boron carbide is the third hardest substance known, after diamond and cubic boron nitride, earning it the nickname &quot;black diamond&quot;.

===Semiconductor properties===
Boron carbide is a semiconductor, with electronic properties dominated by hopping-type transport. The energy band gap depends on composition as well as the degree of order. The band gap is estimated at 2.09 eV, with multiple mid-bandgap states which complicate the photoluminescence spectrum. The material is typically p-type.

==Preparation==
Boron carbide was first synthesized by Henri Moissan in 1899, by reduction of boron trioxide either with carbon or magnesium in presence of carbon in an electric arc furnace. In the case of carbon, the reaction occurs at temperatures above the melting point of B4C and is accompanied by liberation of large amount of carbon monoxide: 
:2 B2O3 + 7 C → B4C + 6 CO

If magnesium is used, the reaction can be carried out in a graphite crucible, and the magnesium byproducts are removed by treatment with acid.
==Applications==

Boron&#x27;s exceptional hardness can be used for the following applications:
*Padlocks
*Personal and vehicle ballistic armor plating
*Grit blasting nozzles
*High-pressure water jet cutter nozzles
*Scratch and wear resistant coatings
*Cutting tools and dies
*Abrasives
*Metal matrix composites
*In brake linings of vehicles

Boron carbide&#x27;s other properties also make it suitable for:
*Neutron absorber in nuclear reactors (see below)
*High energy fuel for solid fuel ramjets 

===Nuclear applications ===
The property of boron carbide to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived radionuclides makes it an attractive neutron radiation shielding or absorbing material, such as in use for control rods in nuclear power reactors. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding and reaction regulation (control rod).

===Boron carbide filaments===
Boron carbide filaments exhibit auspicious prospects as reinforcement elements in resin and metal composites, attributed to their exceptional strength, elastic modulus, and low density characteristics. In addition, boron carbide filaments are not affected by radiation due to its ability to absorb neutrons. It is less harmful than filaments made of other materials, such as cadmium.

<doc id="1095211" wikidata="Q370363" url="?curid=1095211" title="Nero Julius Caesar">
<text>Nero Julius Caesar (c. AD 6–31) was the adopted grandson and heir of the Roman emperor Tiberius, alongside his brother Drusus. Born into the prominent Julio-Claudian dynasty, Nero was the son of Tiberius&#x27; general and heir, Germanicus. After the deaths of his father and of Tiberius&#x27; son, Drusus the Younger, Nero and his brother Drusus were adopted together by Tiberius in September AD 23. As a result of being heirs of the emperor, he and his brother enjoyed accelerated political careers.

Sejanus, prefect of the Praetorian Guard, had become powerful in Rome and is believed by ancient writers such as Suetonius and Tacitus to have been responsible for the downfall of Drusus the Younger. As the power of Sejanus grew, other members of the imperial family began to fall as well. In AD 29, Tiberius wrote a letter to the Senate attacking Nero and his mother, and the Senate had them both exiled. Two years later, he died in exile on the island of Ponza. His brother Drusus also died in exile in AD 33. Their deaths allowed for the adoption and ascension of their younger brother, Caligula, following the death of Tiberius in AD 37.

==Background and family==
Nero was born around AD 6 to Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder. Nero&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Nero Claudius Drusus (Drusus the Elder) and Antonia Minor, daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor. His maternal grandparents were Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a close friend of Augustus, and Augustus&#x27; daughter Julia the Elder. Nero had eight siblings: four brothers (Tiberius and Gaius Julius, who died young; Drusus Caesar; and Gaius, nicknamed &quot;Caligula&quot;) , three sisters (Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, and Julia Livilla) and a brother or sister of unknown name (normally referenced as Ignotus).

As a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was a close relative of all five Julio-Claudian emperors: his great-grandfather Augustus was the first emperor of the dynasty, his great-uncle Tiberius was the second emperor, his brother Gaius (Caligula) was the third emperor, his uncle Claudius was the fourth emperor, and his nephew Lucius Domitius (Nero) was the fifth and final emperor of the dynasty.

Nero&#x27;s father was the adopted son of Tiberius, who was himself the adoptive son of Augustus, whose adoptions were the result of the death of Gaius Caesar in February AD 4. Gaius, who was the heir of Augustus, had died of illness in Syria. Germanicus was for some time considered the new heir by Augustus, but Augustus later decided in favour of his stepson Tiberius. As a result, in June AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on the condition that Tiberius first adopt Germanicus. As a corollary to the adoption, Germanicus was wed to his second cousin Agrippina the Elder the following year.

In AD 13 Nero&#x27;s father was appointed commander of the forces on the Rhine, from where he led three campaigns into Germania against the forces of Arminius. His victories against the German tribes which had made him popular as he avenged the Roman defeat at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. In October AD 14, Germanicus received a delegation from the Senate giving their condolences for the death of Augustus. Augustus had died in August and Tiberius became emperor, making Germanicus heir to the empire. At the direction of Tiberius, Germanicus was dispatched to Asia to reorganize the provinces and assert imperial authority there. However, after two years in the east, Germanicus came into conflict with the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. During their feud, Germanicus fell ill and died in October AD 19.

While Nero&#x27;s father was alive he had been betrothed to the daughter of Creticus Silanus, the one-time governor of Syria. However, in AD 20, Nero married Julia, daughter of Livilla and Drusus the Younger (Tiberius&#x27; only son by Vipsania Agrippina).

==Career==

Nero&#x27;s mother Agrippina believed her husband was murdered to promote Drusus the Younger as heir, and feared that the birth of his twin sons would give him a motive to displace her own sons. However, her fears were unfounded, with Nero being elevated by Tiberius. On 7 June AD 20, Nero was brought into the forum to receive the &quot;toga virilis&quot;, introduced into the Senate by Tiberius and Drusus the Younger, and was promised the office of quaestor in five years&#x27; time. He was excused from holding the lowest magistracy, the vigintivirate, and a &quot;congiaria&quot; of 60 &quot;denarii&quot; was distributed by Tiberius at his &quot;tirocinium&quot;. He was wed to Drusus the Younger&#x27;s daughter, Julia, later that year combining the families of both possible lines of succession (that of Germanicus and Drusus the Younger). His brother Drusus was introduced to the Senate with similar honours in AD 23, and he too was promised the rank of quaestor in five years&#x27; time.

===Heir to the principate===
Following the death of Germanicus, Drusus the Younger was Tiberius&#x27; new heir. He received a second consulship in AD 21 and &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; (tribunician power) in AD 22. At the same time, Praetorian Prefect Sejanus started to exert considerable influence over the emperor, who referred to Sejanus as &quot;Socius Laborum&quot; (&quot;my partner in my toils&quot;). Around AD 20, when Sejanus became the first of the equestrian order to hold the praetorship, a senatorial office, his daughter Aelia Junilla was born and swiftly betrothed to Nero&#x27;s cousin, the boy Claudius Drusus, firstborn son of the future emperor Claudius. At the prospect of a familial bond between the Claudia gens and Sejanus&#x27;s family, Drusus the Younger is reported by Tacitus to have said of Sejanus in disgust &quot;the grandsons of us Drususes will be his grandsons too&quot;. (.) According to Tacitus and Cassius Dio, the Younger Drusus and Sejanus began bickering and entered a feud. Subsequently, Drusus became ill and died of seemingly natural causes on 14 September AD 23. Claudius Drusus also died before reaching adulthood. Ancient sources suggested that the cause of Drusus&#x27; death was poison, whereas modern authors like Barbara Levick are more sceptical, suggesting it may have been illness.

The death of the Younger Drusus left no immediate threat to Sejanus. Ultimately, his death elevated Nero and his brother Drusus to the position of heirs. In effect, this led to the formation of factions, with one faction around Nero and Drusus and their mother Agrippina and the other faction linked to Sejanus. While the full extent of Sejanus&#x27; power at this point is uncertain, it can be noted that Sejanus was not allowed to marry Livilla (Drusus the Younger&#x27;s widow) and was thus denied entry into the imperial family. In the Senate, Sejanus encountered little opposition from the senators, but Tiberius expressed displeasure in the Senate, in AD 24, at the public prayers which had been offered for Nero and his brother Drusus&#x27; health.

In AD 28, the Senate voted that altars to &quot;Clementia&quot; (mercy) and &quot;Amicitia&quot; (friendship) be raised. At that time, &quot;Clementia&quot; was considered a virtue of the ruling class, for only the powerful could give clemency. The altar of &quot;Amicitia&quot; was flanked by statues of Sejanus and Tiberius. By this time, Sejanus&#x27; association with Tiberius had reached the point where members of Roman society would make prayers and sacrifices and erect statues in his honour. Sejanus&#x27; birthday was honoured as if he were a member of the imperial family. According to the author and historian Richard Alston, &quot;Sejanus&#x27; association with Tiberius must have at least indicated to the people that he would be further elevated&quot;.

===Downfall===
The very next year saw a direct attack on Agrippina and Nero. Tiberius sent a letter to the Senate in which he accused Agrippina and Nero of misconduct, but was unable to convict them of any attempt at rebellion. The attitude of the former and the sexual activity of the latter were the primary accusations against them. Agrippina was popular with the people, as was the family of Germanicus, and the people surrounded the senate-house carrying likenesses of the two in protest against Tiberius. The Senate refused to come to a resolution on the matter until it received a clear direction from the emperor to do so. Tiberius found it necessary to repeat his charges, and when he did, the Senate no longer delayed; the fate of Agrippina and Nero was sealed. Nero was declared an enemy of the state, removed to the island of Pontia, and was killed or encouraged to kill himself in AD 31. According to Suetonius, he put an end to his own life when the executioner appeared before him with the instruments of death.

==Post mortem==
His brother Drusus was later also exiled on similar charges of sexual misdemeanours. Sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in October AD 31, just after the death of Nero. The specific reasons for his downfall remain unclear. Alston suggests that Sejanus may have been doing a favour for Tiberius by removing Germanicus&#x27; family from power, noting that Agrippina and Nero&#x27;s brother Drusus were left in exile even after Sejanus&#x27; death.

The deaths of Germanicus&#x27; oldest sons elevated his third son, Gaius Caesar (Caligula), to successor and he became &quot;princeps&quot; when Tiberius died in AD 37. Drusus the Younger&#x27;s son Tiberius Gemellus was summoned to Capri by his grandfather Tiberius, where he and Gaius Caligula were made joint-heirs. When Caligula assumed power, he made Gemellus his adopted son, but Caligula soon had Gemellus killed for plotting against him.

In AD 37, Nero&#x27;s bones were returned to Rome and interred at the Mausoleum of Augustus by Caligula.

<text> is a bright, sub-kilometer asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) of the Aten group, located in Venus&#x27;s zone of influence that has frequent close encounters with Mercury, Venus, and Earth. It made a close approach to Earth on 11 December 2015, passing at a distance of about 4.2 million kilometers (2.6 million miles, 11 lunar distances) and reaching about apparent magnitude 11.

The asteroid was discovered on 25 November 1998 by LINEAR about four months after a close encounter with the planet Mercury (about 0.047 AU). It measures approximately 400 meters in diameter. It is also one of the best studied PHAs and was the 10th Aten asteroid to be numbered.

== Classification and orbit ==
 orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.42–1.02 AU once every 7 months (222 days; semi-major axis of 0.72 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.42 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic.

=== Low aphelion ===

At the time of its discovery, astronomers were trying to find the first Apohele asteroid (one that is always closer to the Sun than Earth). All asteroids known at the time that got closer to the Sun than Earth also crossed Earth&#x27;s orbit. Earlier that year, David J. Tholen claimed to have spotted the first Apohele asteroid, which was dubbed . However, the object was lost without being confirmed. Thus, 1993 DA remained the asteroid with the lowest known aphelion at 1.023 AU. When was discovered, it was found to have a slightly smaller aphelion (1.019 AU) than 1993 DA, and was thus the closest thing to an Apohele asteroid known at the time. It lost its smallest aphelion title almost immediately when was discovered only a few weeks later (aphelion = 1.014 AU). Asteroids with even smaller aphelions were discovered until February 2003, when finally, an asteroid with an aphelion smaller than 1.000 AU was discovered. This was 163693 Atira, the first confirmed Apohele asteroid.

=== Venus zone of influence ===
 was the second asteroid discovered to be close enough to Venus as to be within the major planet&#x27;s zone of influence. It is located at about the inner edge of the zone, while (99907) 1989 VA, the first asteroid discovered there, is at about the outer edge. It is possible for planets to capture asteroids located in their sphere of influences into co-orbital relationships such as Trojan and horseshoe asteroids. Because of its frequent close encounters with Mercury and Earth, however, it may prove difficult for Venus to keep in a co-orbital relationship for any length of time. Of the six objects in Venus&#x27;s zone of influence, only Zoozve is currently a co-orbital.

=== Record close encounter ===

 is a potentially hazardous asteroid. That means its orbit takes it very close to Earth and if it were to collide with our planet, it would cause devastation on at least a regional scale. On 16 December 2001, it became the first PHA to be observed passing within 5 Lunar Distances (the average distance between Earth and the Moon) from Earth. Other asteroids have come closer, and numerous have even come closer than the Moon, but these have all been small asteroids, incapable of causing much damage to the planet, or much concern. The 2001 encounter was the closest known approach to Earth any PHA had made since passed by on 27 August 1969. However, was not discovered until September 1999 many years after its closest approach, so no one knew about in 1969.
In September 2004, the well known PHA 4179 Toutatis came about 4 Lunar Distances from Earth. Due to its diameter being over ten times larger (5.7 km) and its closer approach, Toutatis at its closest (mag 8.9) was about half an apparent magnitude brighter than was at its closest (mag 9.5). However, Toutatis arrived during a full moon, and thus &#x27;s 2001 encounter is still the most easily observed flyby of an asteroid in history. It also made the first Near-Earth asteroid observed to be brighter than magnitude 10.


=== Frequent inner-planet encounters ===

 is a Mercury-crosser asteroid, a Venus-crosser asteroid, and an Earth-crosser asteroid. Because of its relatively low inclination (7.34°), it is able to come close to each of these planets. Its orbit takes it within 0.021 AU of Mercury&#x27;s orbit, 0.0368 AU of Venus&#x27;s orbit, and 0.00989 AU of Earth&#x27;s orbit. It makes frequent encounters with these inner planets. The last time it came close to Mercury, Venus and Earth was 2010, 1977, and 12 November 2004, respectively. The most recent close approach to Earth was on 11 December 2015 at about 4.2 million kilometers (2.6 million miles, 11 lunar distances). The next visit of the asteroid to Earth&#x27;s neighborhood will be on 11 November 2018, when it will make a relatively distant pass at about 20 million kilometers (12.5 million miles, 52 lunar distances). These encounters perturb its orbit parameters slightly, and each pass reduces its inclination further.

== Physical characteristics ==

During its close encounters in 2001 and 2015, astronomers were able to make radar images of its surface and determine physical properties that remain unknown for most asteroids. According to the ExploreNEOs Warm Spitzer Exploration Science program, is a bright E-type asteroid with an exceptionally high albedo of .

=== Diameter and albedo ===

 measures between 350 and 415 meters in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.34 and 0.75. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; an albedo of 0.34 and takes a diameter of 410 meters based on an absolute magnitude of 18.69. The asteroid is modestly elongated, approximately 420 × 330 meters.

=== Rotation period ===

Several rotational lightcurves of have been obtained from radiometric and photometric observations. Lightcurve analysis gave a consolidated rotation period of 3.697 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.19 and 0.65 magnitude ().

== Future flyby candidate ==

 has an orbit that not only crosses Earth&#x27;s orbit, but is roughly parallel to it at its furthest. This means that during favourable years it is easy to reach from Earth. Several times this decade, it will be an easier target than Earth&#x27;s own Moon. It is high on the list of possible Near-Earth Asteroid targets for future flybys, landings, mining, or orbit manipulations.

== Numbering and naming ==

This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 18 August 2002. As of 2018, it has not been named.

<doc id="1095235" wikidata="Q2135976" url="?curid=1095235" title="Red Funnel">
<text>Red Funnel, the trading name of the Southampton Isle of Wight and South of England Royal Mail Steam Packet Company Limited, is a ferry company that carries passengers, vehicles and freight on routes between the English mainland and the Isle of Wight. High-speed foot passenger catamarans, known as &quot;Red Jets&quot;, run between Southampton and Cowes, while vehicle ferries run between Southampton and East Cowes. It also runs the ferry between Southampton and Hythe.

Red Funnel&#x27;s main competitor is Wightlink whose services operate from Portsmouth to Fishbourne and Ryde, and from Lymington to Yarmouth. The other major Solent ferry company, Hovertravel, operates between Southsea and Ryde. Both provide a frequent service to the Isle of Wight, but neither normally serve Southampton, Cowes or East Cowes.

==History==
The origins of Red Funnel date back to 1820, when the &quot;Isle of Wight Royal Mail Steam Packet Company&quot; was established by Cowes interests to operate the first steamer service from there to Southampton. In 1826, the &quot;Isle of Wight Steam Packet Company&quot; was formed in Southampton, and by the following year the two companies had started co-ordinating their operations. In 1860, the &quot;Southampton, Isle of Wight &amp; Portsmouth Improved Steamboat Company&quot; was created to compete with the two established operators, and the threat posed caused the two older companies to merge. They subsequently acquired the assets of the Improved Steamboat Company in 1865.

Formed in 1861, and called &quot;The Southampton Isle of Wight and South of England Royal Mail Steam Packet Company Limited&quot;, the merged company&#x27;s name remains the longest for a registered company in the United Kingdom. The trading name &quot;Red Funnel Steamers&quot; was adopted in 1935 when all the company&#x27;s ships had black-topped red funnels, and later shortened to the current &quot;Red Funnel&quot;. The 1861 name remains the company&#x27;s formal name.

The company originally operated a paddle steamer ferry service between Cowes, Isle of Wight and Southampton. During its history the company has operated other routes connecting the Isle of Wight and the English mainland, together with a sizable excursion steamer business along the South Coast of England including day trips from the Isle of Wight to France, but today services are concentrated on two routes. In 1931 it introduced its first diesel ferry, the MV &quot;Medina&quot;. Ferries have steadily increased in size to the current Scottish-built Raptor class operated between East Cowes and Town Quay in Southampton. Between 1969 and the 1990, the company also ran Italian-built hydrofoils between Town Quay and Cowes. This route is now served by high-speed, passenger-only catamarans.

In 1867 Red Funnel instituted a service crossing the River Medina between Cowes and East Cowes. This service was operated by a series of small launches over the years. The service ceased on the outbreak of war in 1939 when the vessels involved were requisitioned by the Admiralty. In 1868 the company took over the Cowes Floating Bridge Company and operated the floating bridge until 1901.

In 1885 the company bought the &quot;New Southampton Steam Towing Company&quot; and operated tugs and tenders, later under the subsidiary &quot;Red Funnel Towage&quot;. In 2002 Red Funnel Towage was sold to the Adelaide Steamship Company, later passing to Svitzer Marine.

In 1946 Red Funnel acquired a controlling interest in Cosens &amp; Co Ltd, a rival pleasure steamer operator based in Weymouth. This enabled the combined company to coordinate their excursions and also gave Red Funnel access to the Cosens&#x27; marine engineering and ship repair facilities. Excursions came to end in 1966 but the engineering side continued until sold off in 1990 to a management buy-out.

In 2001 the company was sold to JP Morgan Partners by Associated British Ports Holdings, which had acquired the company in 1989 as a white knight to fend off a hostile takeover by Sally Lines. In 2004 the company was sold again in a management buy-out backed by the Bank of Scotland for £60 million. On 12 April 2007, the owners of Red Funnel (who include HBOS) announced that they were considering selling Red Funnel. In June of the same year, the company was sold to the Prudential&#x27;s infrastructure specialist, Infracapital, in a deal valuing the business at more than £200m.

In 2014, plans came to light for the relocation of Red Funnel&#x27;s Southampton terminal, as part of the redevelopment of the derelict Royal Pier. The plans would include relocating the vehicle and foot passenger terminals to a new site at Trafalgar Dry Dock, also known as Pier 50. Plans were approved in 2016, and Red Funnel was supposed to relocate at the end of 2017. However, Southampton City Council terminated the deal to relocate the Royal Pier in August 2019, with the impact on the project to relocate the Red Funnel terminals unclear.

In 2017 the company was sold to a consortium, including West Midlands Pension Fund and the Workplace Safety &amp; Insurance Board. In the same year, construction work began on renovating and enlarging the terminal at East Cowes, the first phase of which was completed in August 2018.

In July 2022, Unite members at Red Funnel went on strike over pay, causing the company to have to run a reduced timetable. According to Red Funnel, this was the first strike at the firm since 1966. The strikes were suspended in August 2022 after the company proposed a new pay agreement.

On 7 September 2023, Red Funnel announced the acquisition of Blue Funnel Ferries which operates the Hythe Ferry service. Blue Funnel Ferries will be renamed the Hythe and Southampton Ferry Company Limited.

===The House Flag===

Red Funnel&#x27;s house flag was adopted in 1861. The design was inspired by the names of the company&#x27;s early paddle-steamers, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Emerald&quot;, &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;. A simple rhyme was the guide to flying it correctly:
==Routes==
===Red Funnel Vehicle Ferry===
Between Southampton and East Cowes, Red Funnel runs four vehicle ferries. The crossing takes roughly an hour. The crossings are, for the most part, run on an hourly basis.

===Red Jet Hi-Speed===
Between Southampton and Cowes, Red Funnel run two High Speed ferries, roughly taking 28 minutes to cross the Solent. The peak frequency is roughly every 35 minutes.

===Hythe Ferry===
Between Southampton and Hythe, Red Funnel runs an hourly service, which is run by one passenger ferry, which is not yet in a Red Funnel livery. This service connects to the Hythe Pier.

==Current fleet==


===Fleet History===
The first three vessels were built by Ferguson Shipbuilders of Port Glasgow, and entered service between 1994 and 1996. Between 2003 and 2005 the ferries were refitted and extended both in length and height by Remontowa S.A. in Gdańsk, Poland. This was following a corporate decision driven by Tom Docherty to maximise summer operating capacity taking the previous capacity from around 100 CEUs to 213 CEU.

During 2014 &quot;Red Falcon&quot; underwent a £2.2 million refurbishment, which saw the interior and facilities replaced with a bright and new modern look. Due to success and increase of passengers on their services during 2014, it was confirmed that &quot;Red Osprey&quot; would also receive a £2.2 million refurbishment. Like her sister ship, the Red Osprey was refitted and relaunched almost exactly a year later. After a delay of three years, the &quot;Red Eagle&quot; was refitted at the end of 2017.

In 2016, Red Funnel took delivery of a new 40-metre high-speed catamaran constructed in East Cowes by Shemara Refit LLP. Named by the Princess Royal on 4 July 2016, &quot;Red Jet 6&quot; entered service later in the summer. &quot;Red Jet 7&quot; was built by Wight Shipyard in East Cowes. &quot;Red Jet 7&quot; was lowered into the River Medina at East Cowes on 6 June 2018, and was christened during a launching ceremony on 24 July 2018.
In February 2018, Red Funnel announced plans to introduce a new freight only ferry into the fleet, to coincide with the refurbishment of their facilities on both sides of the Solent. It was built at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, and was designed to have similar dimensions to Red Funnel&#x27;s Raptor-class fleet, allowing it to load and unload at the same linkspan used by the other ferries. Construction of the new ferry began on 31 May 2018 with a formal keel laying ceremony. During this event, the ship&#x27;s name was announced to be &quot;Red Kestrel&quot;, placing its name in line with those of the rest of Red Funnel&#x27;s RO-RO ferry fleet. She entered service in May 2019.

==Future fleet==
In July 2024, it was announced that Red Funnel would order a new, all electric, Artemis eFoiler hydrofoil boat, to run on the Red Jet route of Southampton to Cowes. The vessel would carry 150 passengers and be capable of charging in less than 60 minutes. It is scheduled to enter service by late 2025.

==Incidents==
*On 9 March 1997, &quot;Red Falcon&quot;, inbound from Cowes, collided in Southampton Water with the outbound trailing suction hopper dredger &quot;Volvox Hansa&quot; in fog. Both ships&#x27; masters were held to blame.
*On 10 March 2006, &quot;Red Falcon&quot;, collided with the linkspan at the Southampton Town Quay terminal. Eight passengers and one crew member were injured and significant damage was caused to the Southampton end of the &quot;Red Falcon&quot; and to the linkspan. The collision caused a hole above the waterline and buckling of the car deck doors.
*&quot;Red Eagle&quot; collided with &quot;Humber Energy&quot; in the Thorne Channel, near Southampton Water, on the evening of 21 December 2006. Coastguards said nobody was injured and neither vessel was badly damaged. Richard Pellew, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said: &quot;Having examined the minor damage sustained to the &quot;Red Eagle&quot; we are advising Red Funnel on the repair work the ferry needs before it can resume normal service.&quot;
*On 5 November 2016 a man on a personal water craft collided with &quot;Red Jet 4&quot;. No one was injured and no damage was caused.
*&quot;Red Eagle&quot; was involved in a collision in thick fog on 27 September 2018. It was reported that the ferry had ploughed through the moorings of three yachts and a channel marker was struck. The following month, the &quot;Red Falcon&quot; also hit several yachts at East Cowes in thick fog, sinking one of them. The vessel grounded in the incident with forty passengers aboard and was not refloated until three hours later. The sunken yacht, &quot;Greylag&quot;, was recovered the following day.

<text>Charles Davenant (1656 – 1714) was an English economist, Tory politician and pamphleteer who sat in the Parliament of England representing the parliamentary constituencies of St Ives and Great Bedwyn.

==Life==
He was born in London as the eldest son of Sir William Davenant, the poet. He was educated at Cheam grammar school and Balliol College, Oxford, but left the university without taking a degree. He became manager of his father&#x27;s theatre. Having taken the degree of LL.D., he became a member of Doctors&#x27; Commons.

In 1678 Davenant was appointed Commissioner of the Excise, earning £500 per year (); taxes were collected using the &quot;farming system&quot;. In 1683 when Britain ended the tax farming system, Davenant received £1000 per year as Commissioner. In 1685 he was elected to Parliament as M.P. for St Ives. However, the revolution of 1688 saw James II exiled to France and William of Orange installed as king by Parliament. In 1689 Davenant lost his position as Commissioner of the Excise, and his loan to James II was nullified.

In 1692 he applied for Controller of the Excise, with Godolphin&#x27;s support, but did not get the position. He applied again in 1694 and again failed to get the position, probably due to objections by Charles Montagu, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1696 his friends in government, Shrewsbury and Godolphin, were under political attack. Godolphin resigned shortly afterward, and Davenant lost his main supporter for appointment to a public office.

In 1698 Davenant returned to Parliament as a representative of Great Bedwyn; he became associated with the Tory party, which replaced the Whig Junto as the majority in Parliament. Davenant was linked to French agents in March 1701, and it was suspected, but not proved, that the French government tried to bribe him to promote their interests and to provide intelligence if England declared war on France. There is evidence that a French agent recommended bribing Davenant, but there is no evidence that &quot;a bribe was ever actually offered or accepted.&quot; The link with the French tarnished Davenant&#x27;s public and political reputation.

In 1702 Queen Anne assumed the throne. The Junto Pembroke Ministry was removed from power, and Davenant&#x27;s friends—Godolphin, Nottingham, and Harley—were placed in positions of power in the Coalition Ministry. In September 1702 Davenant was appointed to the Secretaryship of a commission to negotiate for the union of Scotland and England. In June 1703 he was appointed Inspector General of the Imports and Exports.

Davenant visited Holland in Autumn 1705, to research wartime traffic with France.

In 1710 Godolphin lost his office, which removed one of Davenant&#x27;s supporters from power and threatened his position as Inspector General of the Imports and Exports. Davenant wrote &quot;Sir Thomas Double at Court&quot; and &quot;New Dialogues upon the Present Posture of Affairs&quot; to make amends with the Tory party, which was likely to be returning to power. &quot;Sir Thomas Double at Court&quot; reversed Davenant&#x27;s argument for moderation in his 1703 &quot;Essays upon Peace at Home and War Abroad&quot;; and &quot;New Dialogues upon the Present Posture of Affairs&quot; repeated the attacks on the methods of financing public spending that he had been stating since 1689. He also reversed his stance from &quot;Memorial Concerning the Free Trade now Tolerated between France and Holland&quot; and argued that the Dutch were benefitting from trade with France while &quot;Britain bore the burden of the war.&quot;

Davenant died in 1714 in London.

==Works==
At the age of nineteen he composed a tragedy, &quot;Circe&quot;. As an economist, Davenant was a strong supporter of the mercantile theory, and in his economic pamphlets (as distinct from his political writings) he takes up an eclectic position, recommending governmental restrictions on colonial commerce, but freedom of exchange at home.

Of his writings, a complete edition of which was published in London in 1771, the following are the more important:
*&quot;An Essay on the East India Trade&quot; (1697)
*&quot;Two Discourses on the Public Revenues and Trade of England&quot; (1698)
*&quot;An Essay on the probable means of making the people gainers in the balance of Trade&quot; (1699)
*&quot;A Discourse on Grants and Resumptions and Essays on the Balance of Power&quot; (1701)

In late 1694 he published &quot;An Essay on the Ways and Means of supplying the War&quot;, &quot;a reasoned criticism of the methods used to finance the war with France which England had been waging since 1689. It attacked long-term borrowing as detrimental to trade, and land taxation as inequitable, because of its uneven incidence across the country.&quot;

In November 1695 he wrote and read &quot;Memorial Concerning the Coyn of England&quot; to the Privy Council. This work, commissioned by the Lords Justices, was an argument against the majority party&#x27;s proposal that England&#x27;s coins should be devalued to pay for the war with France.

In 1696 he published &quot;A Memorial Concerning a Council of Trade&quot;, which promoted his idea that trade should be protected, and &quot;A Memorial Concerning Credit and the Means and Methods whereby it may be Restored&quot;, generally viewed as an attempt to curry favour with the party in power to gain a post in the Excise department. In October 1696 he published &quot;Essay on Publick Virtue&quot;, a diatribe against the ruling Whig Junto. In 1696, also, he published &quot;Essay on the East India Trade&quot; in which he &quot;opposed the protection of English Textiles against Indian competition on the grounds that commerce with East India improved Britain&#x27;s balance of trade, and he refuted the arguments of the protectionists with further applications of the balance of trade concept.&quot;

In 1697 he published &quot;Discourses on the Publick Revenues and on the Trade of England&quot;, part 1, which contained strong objections to long-term borrowing as a way to fund government expenditures and advocated paying back the debt incurred during the war as soon as possible. The basis for Davenant&#x27;s argument was that &quot;high taxation for debt service was a burden on trade, industry, and land.&quot; Davenant still believed that land tax was unfair because it placed the heaviest burden of generating public income on the landed gentry, and that the long-term result would be that the gentry would be forced to sell their land to &quot;monied men and usurers&quot; to pay the taxes.

In 1698 he published &quot;Discourses on the Publick Revenues and on the Trade of England&quot; part 2, which described &quot;in a more sustained and complete form the idea of the &#x27;general&#x27; balance of trade.&quot; There is a likely possibility that this pamphlet was also intended to keep his name before the officials of the East India Company as someone who was sympathetic to their business because he was trying to get them to hire him as an agent.

In early 1699 he published &quot;An Essay on the probable Methods of making a People Gainers in the Balance of Trade&quot;. It quoted Gregory King&#x27;s calculation of the value and size of the &quot;natural resources of England.&quot; The last section contained an attack on the actions and policies of the Junto party and was more of a political rant than an exposition of economic ideas. At the end of 1699 he published &quot;A Discourse of Grants and Resumptions&quot;, which discussed the practice of the king and queen of England granting &quot;forfeited Irish Estates&quot; to friends and political allies of the Junto party. Davenant&#x27;s writings begin to shift away from purely economic discussions to political commentary designed to curry favour with the ruling party to secure employment. In 1701 he published &quot;Essays upon I The Balance of Power II The Right of Making War, Peace, and Alliances III Universal Monarchy&quot;, &quot;a highly partisan attack on William III&#x27;s foreign policy.&quot;

In August 1701 Davenant published &quot;The True Picture of a Modern Whig&quot;, an attempt to counter the Whig party&#x27;s push to dissolve the Tory party Parliament by &quot;defending Tory views and exposing Whig motives.&quot; His &quot;Tom Double Returned out of the Country&quot;, also published 1701, explained all of Davenant&#x27;s ideas on trade and public finance and the underlying reasoning behind them. His main concern was that the Whig party would restart the war with France and put the country further into debt, which would in turn require greater taxation of land owners. The land owners would be bankrupted, and the people who had made money off the war would be able to buy the land and usurp the political power of the gentry.

His &quot;Essays upon Peace at Home and War Abroad&quot;, published November 1703, &quot;promoted &#x27;moderation&#x27; and the anti-party attitude favoured by the Queen and Harley.&quot; This pamphlet angered his friends in the Tory party because it was in opposition to the policies the party was pushing at the time. Before 1702, he was the leading promoter of party ideas. With this essay, he was falling out of favour and gaining a reputation for promoting whatever idea benefits him the most personally.

In 1704 Davenant proposed compiling trade numbers for the previous 25 years. The cost of clerks to do the actual tabulation was the primary reason for denial of his request. He wrote, but did not publish, &quot;Memorial Concerning the Free Trade now Tolerated between France and Holland&quot;. The goal was to find support for the current policy of permitting trade between France and Holland. Davenant displayed a favourable opinion of the Dutch in this pamphlet, which contrasts with the position taken in nearly all his other pamphlets.

In 1709 Davenant published &quot;Reflections upon the Constitution and Management of Trade to Africa&quot;, in which he &quot;reverted to his normal attitude of suspicion and outright hostility towards the Dutch.&quot; This pamphlet advocated renewing the Royal African Company&#x27;s monopoly on English trade with Africa on the basis that the Dutch competition &quot;necessitated the maintenance of forts, which only a joint-stock company could afford.&quot; Waddell states that there had been close collaboration between the company and Davenant and that he may have been compensated for writing it. He did go to great lengths to publish the pamphlet anonymously, and was apparently in a difficult financial position; Waddell therefore suggests that this was a work-for-hire and not necessarily something which Davenant actually supported.

In 1712 Davenant published two &quot;Reports to the … Commissioners for … Public Accounts&quot;. Although these reports contained a large amount of statistical data, they continued the theme from &quot;New Dialogues upon the Present Posture of Affairs&quot; that Holland benefitted from trade with France while Britain took on heavy debt during the war with France and that trade with France &quot;was or could be advantageous to England.&quot; This coincided with Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Conduct of the Allies&quot; and provided the economic basis for peace and a commercial treaty with France.

There is some question whether the Law of Demand was developed by Gregory King and then used in some of Charles Davenant&#x27;s writings or whether King and Davenant jointly developed the idea based on King&#x27;s statistical work and published their theory in Davenant&#x27;s pamphlets. King does not describe a formal definition of the law in his journal, which is the primary source of his writings, and Davenant does not seem to be an innovative thinker and often wrote pamphlets to promote ideas or policies that would be beneficial to his personal economic or political status; therefore, it seems likely Davenant extended King&#x27;s work to prove his claims that borrowing to fund the war was bad for England&#x27;s economy and that excise taxes were the appropriate way to fund the government.

Davenant is also credited with being the first to discuss the concept of Balance of Trade as being an important part of the financial health of a country. The foundation of the idea is that importing more goods than were exported would create an outflow of currency. He proposed in &quot;An Essay on Ways and Means of Supplying the War&quot; in 1695 that &quot;export surplus was the best way to finance the war&quot; as opposed to taking on long-term debt and increasing taxes on landowners.

In 1696, Davenant wrote &quot;Essay on the East-India Trade&quot;, which continued the argument that imports should not be restricted because England was a net exporter of the goods imported from India. The restriction of imports would prevent re-exporting the goods to the rest of Europe, and that would decrease the total income of the government. He also expressed a great dislike and distrust of the Dutch government for most of his life, and feared that if Britain did not supply Indian imports the Dutch would supply Europe instead. He did seem to be the first to understand the basic concepts of consumer demand and perfect competition, even though bias against the Dutch stems more from fear of a political challenger to England than fear of losing the competitive advantage of England&#x27;s monopoly in India.

<text>A cello concerto (sometimes called a violoncello concerto) is a concerto for solo cello with orchestra or, very occasionally, smaller groups of instruments.

These pieces have been written since the Baroque era if not earlier. However, unlike instruments such as the violin, the cello had to face harsh competition from the older, well-established viola da gamba. As a result, few important cello concertos were written before the 19th century – with the notable exceptions of those by Vivaldi, C.P.E. Bach, Haydn and Boccherini. Its full recognition as a solo instrument came during the Romantic era with the concertos of Schumann, Saint-Saëns, Lalo and Dvořák. From then on, cello concertos have become more and more frequent. Twentieth-century composers have made the cello a standard concerto instrument, along with the already-rooted piano and violin concertos; among the most notable concertos of the first half of the century are those of Elgar, Prokofiev, Barber and Hindemith. Many post-World War II composers (Shostakovich, Walton, Ligeti, Britten, Dutilleux, Lutoslawski and Penderecki among others) have written at least one.

One special consideration composers must take with the cello (as well as all instruments with a low range) is with the issue of projection. Unlike instruments like the violin, whose high range projects fairly easily above the orchestra, the cello&#x27;s lower notes can be easily lost when the cello is not playing a solo or near solo. Because of this, composers have had to deliberately pare down the orchestral component of cello concertos while the cello is playing in the lower registers.

<text>USS &quot;Elliot&quot; (DD-146) was a in the United States Navy during World War II, first reclassified as DMS-4, and later reclassified as AG-104.

==Namesake==

Richard McCall Elliot Jr. was born on 12 April 1888 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy on 10 July 1909. Lieutenant commander Elliot was killed aboard on 19 March 1918 when her depth charges exploded in collision with a British ship in the convoy &quot;Manley&quot; was escorting.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Elliot&quot; was launched on 4 July 1918 by William Cramp &amp; Sons at Philadelphia, sponsored by Mrs. R. M. Elliot, widow of Lieutenant Commander Elliot. The destroyer was commissioned on 25 January 1919.

==Service history==
After training in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Elliot&quot; sailed from New York on 28 April 1919 to the Azores; Gibraltar; Malta; and Split, returning to Philadelphia on 4 June. Reassigned to the Pacific Fleet, she joined Destroyer Division 13 in New York Harbor in welcoming carrying President Woodrow Wilson back from the peace conference at Paris, then departed for the west coast, arriving at San Diego on 7 August where she was reviewed by Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.

&quot;Elliot&quot; maneuvered offshore with the fleet until 25 March 1920 when she departed for the Far East. In June, she took Admiral Albert Cleaves, Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet, aboard and sailed up the Yangtze to investigate the murder of an American missionary, William A. Reimert. She stood by in China during civil disturbances which threatened American lives and property. In September, she visited Port Arthur and Dalian on intelligence duty, and then returned to her base at Cavite for . &quot;Elliot&quot; went home to San Francisco in late 1921. In October, she arrived at San Diego to lie in reserve until being decommissioned on 22 May 1922.

Recommissioned on 8 February 1930, &quot;Elliot&quot; ranged the west coast with Destroyer Division 11 as plane guard in battle practice and major fleet problems. In early 1934, she sailed for the east coast and a two-ocean fleet problem.

&quot;Elliot&quot; was assigned new duty in 1935 when she became high-speed towing vessel for fleet targets. From 1937, she was also continuously available for training and experimental services. In 1940, she accompanied the Eclipse Expedition to Muleje, Baja California, and then was assigned to Pearl Harbor. She was converted to a high-speed minesweeper, and reclassified DMS-4 on 19 November 1940.

In exercises with Mine Division 6, &quot;Elliot&quot; often got as far as Hawaii. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, she was returning to her base with TF 3 from Johnston Island, and at once began anti-submarine patrol duties there.

&quot;Elliot&quot; continued to patrol in Hawaii until 11 July 1942, when she sailed for the Aleutians. She joined TG 8.6 for bombardment of Kiska on 7 August, and then took up patrol and escort work. In May 1943, she swept mines before and during invasion of Attu.

Reporting to Operational Training Command at San Francisco in June, &quot;Elliot&quot; served at San Diego, towing targets and serving as a training ship until 13 August 1944. Sailing to Pearl Harbor, she had similar duty until 22 July 1945, and then she returned to San Pedro for inactivation. She had been reclassified AG-104 on 5 June 1945. &quot;Elliot&quot; was decommissioned on 12 October 1945, and sold for scrap on 29 January 1946.

<text>Montague ( ) is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in Montague County, Texas, United States. It is the county seat of Montague County and had an estimated population of 400 in 2000, according to the &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot;. Its population was 304 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
Montague was established in 1858 on of land donated by the state of Texas. The community was named for Daniel Montague, an early surveyor. A post office opened in 1860.

By 1880, an estimated 400 residents lived in the community. They supported five businesses, three churches, a school, and the only flour and grist mills in the county. Montague was incorporated in 1886. That year W.A. Morris and C.C. White tried to raise funds to construct an independent rail line to connect Montague with Bowie, but they were unable to gain a sufficient amount. Bypassed by the railroad, the community suffered isolation and lack of growth. Residents of the town voted to dis-incorporate the community in 1900.

In 1915, an estimated 300 people lived in Montague. That figure reached a low of 284 in 1947. As highways were constructed following World War II, and more people and freight traveled by automobiles and trucks, a modest recovery began. The community began growing again by the 1970s. In 1990 and 2000, around 400 residents lived in the community.

==Geography==
Montague is located near the intersection of State Highways 59 and 175 in central Montague County.

The community is situated approximately northwest of Fort Worth, southeast of Wichita Falls, and northeast of Bowie.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Montague has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
Montague first appeared as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census.

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 261 people, 90 households, and 60 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==
Public education in Montague is provided by the Montague Independent School District, which serves students in grades pre-kindergarten through eight. Ninth through twelfth graders attend high school in nearby Nocona or Bowie.

<doc id="1095270" wikidata="Q1544269" url="?curid=1095270" title="Great End">
<text>Great End is the most northerly mountain in the Scafell chain, in the English Lake District. From the south it is simply a lump continuing this chain.
From the north, however, it appears as an immense mountain, with an imposing north face rising above Sprinkling Tarn (lake). This is a popular location for wild camping, and the north face attracts many climbers.

Alfred Wainwright wrote of Great End in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells:
&quot;This is the true Lakeland of the fellwalker, the sort of terrain that calls him back time after time, the sort of memory that haunts his long winter exile. It is not the pretty places – the flowery lanes of Grasmere or Derwentwater&#x27;s wooded bays – that keep him restless in his bed; it is the magnificent ones. Places like Great End...&quot;

==Topography==

The imposing north-eastern cliffs, riven by gullies, rise some from the Esk Hause path. Their orientation ensures that the sun rarely reaches them, the gullies often retaining snow well into the spring. From the left when viewed from below the principal fissures are South East Gully, Central Gully and Cust&#x27;s Gully (see below). To the west of the cliffs a ridge descends more gradually in the general direction of Sty Head. This is known as The Band, and it too sports a harsh gash across its features. On the western side of The Band is the deep ravine of Skew Gill, a tributary of Wasdale-bound Lingmell Beck. At the base of The Band the ridge continues as the complex top of Seathwaite Fell, replete with numerous tarns. The largest is Sprinkling Tarn with its beautifully indented shoreline providing perfect foreground for views of the cliff.

Sty Head is one of the focal points of the District for walkers. The name strictly applies to the col between Great End and Great Gable at a height of , but is now more generally given to the path which crosses it. This connects two of the most popular starting points for walks in the high fells, Wasdale Head and Seathwaite. Sty Head is also a walker&#x27;s crossroads with other paths leading direct up Great Gable and following the outflow of Sprinkling Tarn up to Esk Hause.

Westward from the summit Great End makes a rocky descent toward the arms of Lingmell Beck. This flank is crossed by the Corridor Route, the popular path to Scafell Pike from Sty Head. Above the path are the subsidiary top of Round How (a Nuttall) and the tiny, beautifully clear tarn of Lambfoot Dub.

The southward ridge to the Scafells crosses a shallow saddle and then climbs over Ill Crag and Broad Crag, a well-blazoned path leading across the stony terrain to the summit of Scafell Pike. To the east of the first depression is Calf Cove, its easy slopes leading down to Esk Hause.

The summit has two cairns of very similar height, that to the north-west being nearer to the cliff edge and having the better view. Northwards along Borrowdale the vista is unsurpassed, but the whole panorama is excellent. The heads of the gullies can also be approached for startling views down the face.

==Geology==
The summit is formed by the laminated volcaniclastic claystone and siltstone of the Esk Pike Formation overlying the dacitic welded lapilli tuff of the Lincomb Tarns Formation. The latter is revealed in the great north front.

==Ascents==
Great End may be ascended from Sty Head Tarn via The Band (not to be confused with the more famous Band on Bowfell), from Wasdale Head along Lingmell Gill and Spouthead Gill, from Borrowdale via Grains Gill, from Great Langdale via Rossett Gill and Esk Hause, or from Eskdale. As an intermediate objective Great End may easily be climbed from the main path between Esk Hause and Scafell Pike, requiring only a detour of some .

==Cust&#x27;s Gully==
Cust&#x27;s Gully at the western end of Great End&#x27;s cliffs is named after 19th-century pioneer climber and sketcher Arthur Cust, a classical scholar from Yorkshire also known for his watercolour sketches of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. Cust&#x27;s Gully is a Grade 1 rock climb, but a difficult obstacle for walkers ascending from Sprinkling Tarn. Cust&#x27;s first winter ascent of the gully was recorded in 1880, although he is thought to have ascended it earlier.

<doc id="1095275" wikidata="Q415075" url="?curid=1095275" title="Cyanogen chloride">
<text>Cyanogen chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula NCCl. This linear, triatomic pseudohalogen is an easily condensed colorless gas. More commonly encountered in the laboratory is the related compound cyanogen bromide, a room-temperature solid that is used in biochemical analysis and preparation. Cyanogen compounds are highly toxic.

==Synthesis, basic properties, structure==
Cyanogen chloride is a molecule with the connectivity . The carbon and chlorine atoms are linked by a single bond, and carbon and nitrogen by a triple bond. It is a linear molecule, as are the related cyanogen halides (NCF, NCBr, NCI). Cyanogen chloride is produced by the oxidation of sodium cyanide with chlorine. This reaction proceeds via the intermediate cyanogen ().
The compound trimerizes in the presence of acid to the heterocycle called cyanuric chloride.

Cyanogen chloride is slowly hydrolyzed by water at neutral pH to release cyanate and chloride ions:

==Applications in synthesis==
Cyanogen chloride is a precursor to the sulfonyl cyanides and chlorosulfonyl isocyanate, a useful reagent in organic synthesis. 

Further chlorination gives the isocyanide dichloride.

==Safety==
Also known as CK, cyanogen chloride is a highly toxic blood agent, and was once proposed for use in chemical warfare. It causes immediate injury upon contact with the eyes or respiratory organs. Symptoms of exposure may include drowsiness, rhinorrhea (runny nose), sore throat, coughing, confusion, nausea, vomiting, edema, loss of consciousness, convulsions, paralysis, and death. It is especially dangerous because it is capable of penetrating the filters in gas masks, according to United States analysts. CK is unstable due to polymerization, sometimes with explosive violence.

==Chemical weapon==
Cyanogen chloride is listed in schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: all production must be reported to the OPCW.

By 1945, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Chemical Warfare Service developed chemical warfare rockets intended for the new M9 and M9A1 Bazookas. An M26 Gas Rocket was adapted to fire cyanogen chloride-filled warheads for these rocket launchers. As it was capable of penetrating the protective filter barriers in some gas masks, it was seen as an effective agent against Japanese forces (particularly those hiding in caves or bunkers) because their standard issue gas masks lacked the barriers that would provide protection against cyanogen chloride. The US added the weapon to its arsenal, and considered using it, along with hydrogen cyanide, as part of Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan, but President Harry Truman decided against it, instead using the atomic bombs developed by the secret Manhattan Project. The CK rocket was never deployed or issued to combat personnel.

<text>A blood agent is a toxic chemical agent that affects the body by being absorbed into the blood. Blood agents are fast-acting, potentially lethal poisons that typically manifest at room temperature as volatile colorless gases with a faint odor. They are either cyanide- or arsenic-based.

== Exposure ==

Blood agents work through inhalation or ingestion. As chemical weapons, blood agents are typically disseminated as aerosols and take effect through inhalation. Due to their volatility, they are more toxic in confined areas than in open areas.

Cyanide compounds occur in small amounts in the natural environment and in cigarette smoke. They are also used in several industrial processes and as pesticides. Cyanides are released when synthetic fabrics or polyurethane burn, and may thus contribute to fire-related deaths. Arsine gas, formed when arsenic encounters an acid, is used as a pesticide and in the semiconductor industry; most exposures to it occur accidentally in the workplace.

== Symptoms ==

The symptoms of blood agent poisoning depend on concentration and duration.

Cyanide-based blood agents irritate the eyes and the respiratory tract, while arsine is nonirritating. Hydrogen cyanide has a faint, bitter, almond odor that only about half of all people can smell. Arsine has a very faint garlic odor detectable only at greater than fatal concentrations.

Exposure to small amounts of cyanide has no effect. Higher concentrations cause dizziness, weakness and nausea, which cease with the exposure, but long-time exposure can cause mild symptoms followed by permanent brain damage and muscle paralysis. Moderate exposure causes stronger and longer-lasting symptoms, including headache, that can be followed by convulsions and coma. Stronger or longer exposure will also lead to convulsions and coma. Very strong exposure causes severe toxic effects within seconds, and rapid death.

The blood of people killed by blood agents is bright red, because the agents inhibit the use of the oxygen in it by the body&#x27;s cells. Cyanide poisoning can be detected by the presence of thiocyanate or cyanide in the blood, a smell of bitter almonds, or respiratory tract inflammations and congestions in the case of cyanogen chloride poisoning. There is no specific test for arsine poisoning, but it may leave a garlic smell on the victim&#x27;s breath.

== Effects ==
At sufficient concentrations, blood agents can quickly saturate the blood and cause death in a matter of minutes or seconds. They cause powerful gasping for breath, violent convulsions and a painful death that can take several minutes. The immediate cause of death is usually respiratory failure.

Blood agents work at the cellular level by preventing the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the body&#x27;s cells. This causes the cells to suffocate from lack of oxygen. Cyanide-based agents do so by interrupting the electron transport chain in the inner membranes of mitochondria. Arsine damages the red blood cells which deliver oxygen throughout the body.

== Detection and countermeasures ==

Chemical detection methods, in the form of kits or testing strips, exist for hydrogen cyanide. Ordinary clothing provides some protection, but proper protective clothing and masks are recommended. Mask filters containing only charcoal are ineffective, and effective filters are quickly saturated.

Due to their high volatility, cyanide agents generally need no decontamination. In enclosed areas, fire extinguishers spraying sodium carbonate can decontaminate hydrogen cyanide, but the resulting metal salts remain poisonous on contact. Liquid hydrogen cyanide can be flushed with water.

Cyanide poisoning can be treated with antidotes.

== List of blood agents ==

The information in the following table, which lists blood agents of military significance, is taken from Ledgard. The values given are on a scale from 1 to 10.
Sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, colorless crystalline compounds similar in appearance to sugar, also act as blood agents. Carbon monoxide could technically be called a blood agent because it binds with oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood (see carbon monoxide poisoning), but its high volatility makes it impractical as a chemical warfare agent.

One of the earliest proposed chemical weapons, cacodyl oxide, or Cadet&#x27;s fuming liquid, also displays properties of a blood agent (as well as those of a malodorant). It was proposed as a chemical weapon in the British Empire during the Crimean War, along with the significantly more potent blood agent, cacodyl cyanide.

==Use==
The most significant practical application of blood agents was the use of hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B) in gas chambers by Nazi Germany to commit the mass murder of Jews and others in the course of the Holocaust. This resulted in the largest death toll as a result of the use of chemical agents to date.

<text>Catstye Cam is a fell in the English Lake District. It is an outlier of Helvellyn in the Eastern Fells.

==Name==
The name of the fell is also given as &#x27;Catstycam&#x27;, a spelling preferred by Alfred Wainwright in his influential &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot;. A third variant, &#x27;Catchedicam&#x27;, is also quoted by him. Other guidebooks such as Collins Landranger and Birkett follow Wainwright with &#x27;Catstycam&#x27;, although the maps of the Ordnance Survey always use &#x27;Catstye Cam&#x27;.

==Topography==
The Helvellyn range runs broadly north to south for about 7 miles, remaining above throughout its length. Helvellyn itself sits near the centre of this ridge and displays the characteristic form of many of these fells, namely smooth grassy slopes to the west and shattered rock to the east. Helvellyn sends out two eastward arêtes, razor-thin ridges between deep mountain corries. The southerly spur is Striding Edge, easily the most famous ridge in the district, and its northern partner is Swirral Edge. From the summit plateau of Helvellyn a rough slope drops to the start of Swirral Edge, and this narrow ridge curves gracefully down and then back up over half a mile, terminating at Catstye Cam.

Taking on the classic mountain shape of a pyramid, Catstye Cam draws the eye in any view where the overtopping bulk of Helvellyn is hidden behind. As Wainwright said &quot;If Catstycam stood alone, remote from its fellows, it would be one of the finest peaks in Lakeland. It has nearly, but not quite, the perfect mountain form with true simplicity in its soaring lines, and a small pointed top, a real summit that falls away on all sides&quot;. Even with the connection to Helvellyn, Catstye Cam still has a prominence of over due to the pronounced bow of Swirral Edge. High Spying How on Striding Edge, by comparison, is nothing but a rock turret, an independent peak in almost no-one&#x27;s estimation.

East of the summit the ridge declines quickly to Red Tarn Beck, whilst there is a third ridge to the north west, giving Catstye Cam a triangular plan. To the north, between the two descending ridges, is an area of crag. The other two faces are steep but smooth.

South of Catstye Cam, nestling between the encircling arms of Helvellyn&#x27;s two edges, is Red Tarn. This pool is named for the colour of the surrounding screes rather than its water, and contains brown trout and schelly, a fresh-water herring. The depth of Red Tarn is now about , although in the mid-19th century it was dammed with boulders to increase capacity. This was carried out to provide additional water to the Greenside Mine in Glenridding, the water race still visible as it crosses the slope of Birkhouse Moor.

A second tarn once existed in Brown Cove to the north at Catstye Cam, but this is now reduced to a couple of small pools widening the stream. Brown Cove Tarn was another creation of the Greenside mine, a stone faced dam being built in about 1860. The dam is still in place but water now leaks through the base, the extended tarn-bed a smooth patch of luxuriant turf. A water leat passing beneath the north face of Catstye Cam to Red Tarn Beck can still be traced although it is now in ruins. Water from Brown Cove and Red Tarn unites at the base of the east ridge to form Glenridding Beck, flowing on through the village to Ullswater.

==Geology==
The principal rock type is the dacitic lapilli tuff of the Helvellyn Formation.

==Summit==
The summit of Catstye Cam is small and neat, bearing only a tiny cairn. The view is extensive and even the looming Helvellyn only adds to the drama by showing its eastern face in close detail. Striding Edge is also seen in profile across Red Tarn, lines of pilgrims frequently queueing at the bottlenecks. By contrast Catstye Cam is often almost completely deserted.

==Ascents==

Catstye Cam is normally climbed from Glenridding, either by its east or north west ridges. Both are steep, but there are no technical difficulties. A fair path also climbs via Red Tarn to the midpoint of Swirral Edge, from where a brief detour back to the summit can be made. By far the best option is a circular tour via Striding and Swirral Edges. This takes in Birkhouse Moor, Helvellyn and Catstye Cam, one of the most breathtaking walks in the country.

<text>, also known simply as Hotei ( ), is a Japanese musician, singer-songwriter, composer, record producer and actor. With a career spanning more than 40 years, Hotei claims record sales of over 40 million copies and has collaborated with artists from around the world. Hotei first rose to prominence in the 1980s as the guitarist for Boøwy, one of Japan&#x27;s most popular rock bands, before starting a solo career.

In 2003, he was ranked number 70 on HMV Japan&#x27;s list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. He ranked second in a 2011 poll on who the Japanese people thought was the best guitarist to represent Japan. An iconic artist in his native Japan, he moved to London in 2005 and continues to perform and release music globally. Hotei&#x27;s song &quot;Battle Without Honor or Humanity&quot; has been featured in numerous films, commercials, video games, and events, including Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s feature film &quot;Kill Bill&quot;.

==Early life==
Hotei was born to a Korean father and a Russian-born Japanese mother. He first began playing the guitar in junior high school. Inspired by a poster of T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan, he stole money from his mother&#x27;s purse and bought a Stratocaster at fourteen years old. His first band, Blue Film, finished runners up in a school contest to Death Penalty, a band led by Kyosuke Himuro. Hotei was expelled shortly before graduation, because, when warned about his long hair he replied &quot;Jesus had long hair!&quot;

==Career==
===Boøwy (1981–1988)===

After being expelled from high school, Hotei traveled to Tokyo. He became better acquainted with Kyosuke Himuro and they decided to hold auditions for a new band, which in 1981 became the six-member . After changing their name to Boøwy, they released their first album &quot;Moral&quot; in 1982. They then became a quartet and went on to become major stars in Japan, releasing six studio albums in six years, and even playing the Marquee Club in London in 1985. In 1986 they released their first million-selling album, &quot;Beat Emotion&quot;. In 1988, the year they broke up, they became the first male artists to have three number-one albums within a single year on the Oricon chart. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Boøwy at number 22 on their list of the &quot;100 Most Important Japanese Pop Acts&quot;.

===Solo career in Japan (1988–2012)===
After the break up of Boøwy, Hotei released his debut solo album &quot;Guitarhythm&quot; in 1988 via EMI Records, and established himself as a solo artist. Throughout the 1990s Hotei&#x27;s profile continued to grow in Japan, with regular album releases supported by major tours and with Hotei writing songs and producing for other artists, including collaborations with both Japanese and international artists. Hotei also made two albums with Koji Kikkawa as Complex, both of which went to number one in the national charts. &quot;Guitarhythm&quot; is currently his only album sung completely in English. Hotei has recorded most of his albums outside of Japan, largely in Europe, including in London, Berlin, and Montreux.

Hotei has recorded with many foreign musicians, including playing on The Stranglers Hugh Cornwell&#x27;s 1993 solo album, on stage with David Bowie at the Nippon Budokan in 1996, and at the closing ceremony of the 1996 Summer Olympics with Michael Kamen. He later recorded &quot;Guitar Concerto&quot; with Kamen. He has worked with Andy Mackay of Roxy Music, guitarist Chris Spedding and Mike Edwards of Jesus Jones. Hotei also sometimes tours Europe, including at a number of major festivals. His regular drummer in recent years, Zachary Alford, has previously played with Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie. Hotei&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Supersonic Generation&quot;, recorded in part with Apollo 440 and Ofra Haza, was released in 14 European countries.

In addition to many bestselling solo albums, Hotei composed and performed the score for Hiroyuki Nakano&#x27;s &quot;Samurai Fiction&quot;, as well as starring in the film. He composed three tracks for the cult classic American film &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; together with Ray Cooper. Hotei&#x27;s best known song &quot;Battle Without Honor or Humanity&quot; was used in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s feature film &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA&quot;, and Michael Bay&#x27;s feature film &quot;Transformers&quot;. Hotei recorded a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; for &quot;Merry Axemas: A Guitar Christmas&quot;, an instrumental guitar Christmas album featuring tracks from guitarists including Richie Sambora, Jeff Beck, Joe Perry, Eric Johnson, Steve Vai and Steve Morse.

Hotei collaborated with Char for the 2006 single &quot;Stereocaster&quot;. The following year he, Char and Brian Setzer held a short joint tour.

On July 30 and 31, 2011, Hotei and Kikkawa reunited as Complex for two nights at the Tokyo Dome. All proceeds were donated to aid the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

On February 1, 2012, Hotei performed a concert at the Saitama Super Arena to celebrate his 50th birthday. Former Boøwy drummer Makoto Takahashi appeared as a special guest and together they played Boøwy&#x27;s &quot;Justy&quot; and &quot;No. New York&quot;. Hotei made his directorial debut in April 2012, with the stage play &quot;Psychedelic Pain&quot;, for which he also wrote the music. On May 8, it was announced that Hotei would move to London in June, in hopes of starting an international career.

===Relocating to London and international focus===
====2012–2014====

After years of spending a great deal of time in the UK, Hotei and his family relocated fully to London in June 2012, primarily for Hotei to pursue his dream of an international career. Hotei played his first major show in the UK in December 2012 at The Roundhouse in London. In November 2013 Hotei played 2 headline shows, first at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London, and then at the Highline Ballroom in New York. In an interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Hotei commented, &quot;Last year I turned 50...time goes quickly, it&#x27;s my last chance to try and get my dream. I want to play all over the world.&quot;

On March 6, 2014, Hotei joined The Rolling Stones on stage during the final show of their tour in Japan. He was a surprise guest at their Tokyo Dome concert, playing the song &quot;Respectable&quot; before a crowd of 53,000 fans. Hotei&#x27;s most famous song &quot;Battle Without Honor or Humanity&quot; was selected for a nationwide TV commercial in the UK for Buxton Water&#x27;s &quot;Naturally Pumped Up&quot; campaign. The campaign launched in June 2014, with plans to run for six months.

Joined by band members Zachary Alford (drums), Tony Grey (bass), and Toshiyuki Kishi (keyboard/programming), Hotei played a series of private shows and summer festivals during June, July, and August 2014. This included appearances at England&#x27;s Cornbury Festival, Switzerland&#x27;s Montreux Jazz Festival, and the UK&#x27;s Y Not Festival. An earlier warmup gig was held at The Lexington in London, and Hotei was also invited to perform solo as a special guest of Lord March during the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Live4Ever covered the Y Not Festival, describing Hotei as &quot;undoubtedly the coolest man on site during his afternoon set on the main stage, performing instrumental sections fit for several people in his ability to flick between technically staggering solos and crunching guitar chords whilst jumping around the stage like an excitable Duracell rabbit.&quot;

During a brief trip back to Japan, Hotei played four sold-out shows at the Blue Note Tokyo in late August, and also performed at a private party for the launch of the new Lamborghini Huracán automobile. Hotei wrote and performed the theme song, &quot;Trick Attack (Theme of Lupin The Third)&quot;, to the 2014 live-action film adaptation of the &quot;Lupin III&quot; manga. After spending much of the year writing and recording with a variety of collaborators, the album &quot;New Beginnings&quot; was released in Japan on October 1, 2014, the title a reflection of the new chapter in Hotei&#x27;s career, after relocating to London. Iggy Pop contributed lyrics and vocals to two tracks on the album and Vula Malinga vocals to one.

====2015–2016====
Hotei&#x27;s released the single &quot;How The Cookie Crumbles&quot; featuring Iggy Pop on vocals in June, the first single to be released from his forthcoming second English-language solo album &quot;Strangers&quot;, which was released by Spinefarm Records/Universal Music on October 16, 2015. It was his first album to be released globally outside Japan. It includes several songs released on &quot;New Beginnings&quot;. In addition to Pop, it also features Richard Kruspe from Rammstein, Matthew Tuck from Bullet for My Valentine, Noko and Shea Seger. The album release was accompanied by a performance at Islington Assembly Hall in London, with special guests Seger and Gary Stringer from British rock band Reef.

Hotei celebrated his 35th anniversary in music in 2016, which included 57 live shows in Japan in a variety of different venues, from small clubs to major arenas, and finishing with a 35-song performance at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo on December 30. As well as his anniversary, Hotei continued to work internationally to support his &quot;Strangers&quot; album. In February 2016, Hotei performed showcases at Paradiso/Amsterdam, La Boule Noir/Paris and Cassiopeia/Berlin, with Noko on bass and Cliff Hewitt on drums. In July 2016 he performed live in Los Angeles for the first time, selling out The Troubadour, and also returned to Highline Ballroom in New York. A third single was released from the album, &quot;Move It&quot; featuring Richard Kruspe was released in April 2016, and a fourth, &quot;Walking Through The Night&quot; featuring Iggy Pop, was released in November.

Hotei contributed guitar to Zucchero Fornaciari&#x27;s song &quot;Ti voglio sposare&quot; for the Italian singer&#x27;s &quot;Black Cat&quot; album, which was released in April 2016, beginning a series of collaborations between the two artists which included Zucchero&#x27;s first ever performances in Tokyo in May 2016, accompanied by Hotei, at an event organized by the Italian Embassy in Tokyo, and Hotei&#x27;s first ever live appearance in Italy, at Zucchero&#x27;s record-breaking Verona Arena run of dates, in September.

====2017–2018====
In February 2017 Hotei joined Fornaciari on stage at the Sanremo Music Festival in Italy and returned to Arena di Verona in May for two more performances. In April 2017 Hotei completed his first tour of Europe, performing in 8 cities in Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, and Belgium over 2 weeks, including Paaspop Festival in the Netherlands. In May 2017 Hotei was special guest at Zucchero&#x27;s first ever headline show in Tokyo with his own band. Hotei also performed his first headline live shows in Asia outside of Japan, in Taipei and Hong Kong.

Having completed the album in July, with recording largely taking place again in London, Hotei released his 17th solo album &quot;Paradox&quot; worldwide on October 25, 2017. It is his first Japanese-language album since &quot;Come Rain Come Shine&quot; almost five years earlier. The album was launched with three lyric videos, for the songs &quot;Dreamers are Lonely&quot;, &quot;Amplifire&quot; and &quot;Hitokoto&quot;. Hotei completed the Paradox tour in Japan in December 2017. His song &quot;Kill to Love You&quot; featuring Matthew Tuck from British heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine was used in the UK trailers for Russian action movie &quot;Attraction&quot; in December 2017 and January 2018.

Hotei did an exclusive live streaming performance from British Grove Studios in London on March 24, for a NTT phone app. The one hour performance at 1pm was able to be watched live in Japan at 10pm and available for a few weeks thereafter. Hotei continued his live collaborations with Zucchero Fornaciari, joining him at two arena shows in Turin and Milan in January 2018, and then for two shows in Piazza San Marco, in Venice in July, for the Wanted - Un&#x27;altra storia Tour. Hotei collaborated again with the &quot;Hokuto no Ken&quot; franchise in September, for their 35th anniversary, with a new single called &quot;202X&quot;, which was accompanied by an animated video and a second song &quot;Boombastic&quot;.

On October 20, 2018 Hotei performed his first headline show in London for three years, at a special concert at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, featuring his largest band presentation in the West, including a horn section, backing vocalists and featuring special guest Zucchero. The concert was again filmed for streaming by NTT in Japan. Hotei also toured again in Europe, with a return to Brussels and Zurich and his first headline show in Milan, which also featured Zucchero as special guest. Hotei ended 2018 with his first tour of Japan that was not tied in with an album release. The Tonight I&#x27;m Yours Tour featured a repertoire from Hotei&#x27;s entire career and visited 18 Japanese cities. He performed live on &quot;Kohaku Uta Gassen&quot; on December 31 in Tokyo, his second performance on the major New Year&#x27;s Eve TV show.

====2019–present====
Hotei released his 18th solo studio album, &quot;Guitarhythm VI&quot; in May 2019, 10 years after &quot;Guitarhythm V&quot;. It features collaborations with Man With A Mission, Cornelius, keyboard player Mike Garson, and Hotei&#x27;s former Boøwy bandmates Tsunematsu Matsui and Makoto Takahashi. The album was preceded by three singles in the month before its release, with lead single &quot;Give It To The Universe&quot; becoming Hotei&#x27;s fastest streamed track up to that point. A nationwide summer Guitarhythm VI tour followed the album release, with Hotei using a UK rhythm section for the first time for a Japanese tour - Steve Barney (drums) and Mark Neary (bass). In September Hotei was special guest at two shows for the all star SAS band in Portsmouth and London UK, sharing the stage with Roger Taylor, Spike Edney and Justin Hawkins amongst others. Hotei reprised his GuitarRhythm Tour in Japan in December.

On November 25, 2020, Hotei released the collaborative album &quot;Soul to Soul&quot;, which features collaborations with his fellow Japanese Kazuya Yoshii and Glim Spanky, as well as international acts like Carlinhos Brown, Marc Lavoine, Calogero and Yang Kun.

==Personal life==
Hotei has been married twice. He married singer Kumiko Yamashita in January 1986; they divorced in November 1997. He has been married to singer and actress Miki Imai since June 1999. They have a daughter (born July 26, 2002).

Although based in London, Hotei travels frequently between Japan and the UK for concert tours, recording, and event appearances. In February 2013, BBC World News ran a feature on Hotei and his recent life in London.

On June 14, 2007, Hotei allegedly assaulted his friend and punk rock singer Kō Machida. The incident happened when the two men got into an argument about a band they planned on forming together. Machida filed a police report on the 18th, and Hotei was ordered to pay a fine of 300,000 yen on October 1.

<text>Daniel Neal (14 December 16784 April 1743) was an English historian.

==Biography==
Born in London, he was educated at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, and at the universities of Utrecht and Leiden. In 1704 he became assistant minister, and in 1706 sole minister, of an independent congregation worshipping in Aldersgate Street, and afterwards in Jewin Street, London, where he remained almost until his death. He married Elizabeth Lardner (d. 1748), by whom he had one son, Nathanael, and two daughters.

In 1720 Neal published his &quot;History of New England&quot;, which obtained for its author the honorary degree of MA from Harvard College. He also undertook to assist Dr John Evans in writing a history of Nonconformity. Evans, however, died in 1730, and, making use of his papers for the period before 1640, Neal wrote the whole of the work himself.

This &quot;History of the Puritans&quot; deals with the time between the Protestant Reformation and 1689; the first volume appearing in 1732, and the fourth and last in 1738. The first volume was attacked in 1733 for unfairness and inaccuracy by Isaac Maddox, afterwards bishop of St Asaph and bishop of Worcester, to whom Neal replied in a pamphlet, &quot;A Review of the principal facts objected to in the first volume of the History of the Puritans&quot;; and the remaining volumes by Zachary Grey (1688–1766), to whom the author made no reply.

&quot;The History of the Puritans&quot; was edited, in five volumes, by Dr Joshua Toulmin (1740–1815), who added a life of Neal in 1797. This was reprinted in 1817, and an edition in two volumes was published in New York in 1844.

<doc id="1095306" wikidata="Q4925984" url="?curid=1095306" title="Blencathra">
<text>Blencathra, also known as Saddleback, is one of the most northerly of the Cumbrian Mountains, in the English Lake District. It has six separate fell tops, of which the highest is the Hallsfell Top at .

==Name==
For many years, Ordnance Survey listed Blencathra under the alternative name of &#x27;Saddleback&#x27;, which was coined in reference to the shape of the mountain when seen from the east. The guidebook author Alfred Wainwright popularised using the older Cumbric name, which is now used almost exclusively. Ordnance Survey currently marks the summit as ‘Saddleback or Blencathra’.

The name Blencathra is likely derived from the Cumbric elements *&quot;blain&quot; ‘top, summit’ and &quot;cadeir&quot; ‘seat, chair’, meaning ‘the summit of the seat’. Andrew Breeze has proposed an alternative interpretation of the second element of the name, arguing that it represents a Cumbric cognate of Middle Welsh &quot;carthwr&quot; ‘working horse’. Richard Coates has suggested that the second element may be the Middle Irish personal name &quot;Carthach&quot;, but writes that ‘the implications of that with a Brittonic generic need exploring’.

==Topography==
The Northern Fells make up a roughly circular upland area about wide. At the centre is the marshy depression of Skiddaw Forest — a treeless plateau at an altitude of — and flowing outward from here are the rivers which divide the area into three sectors. Between the Glenderaterra Beck and the River Caldew, the southeastern sector contains Blencathra and its satellites.

Blencathra is more of a small range than a single fell, a series of tops standing out on a curving ridge long. It has smooth, easy slopes to the north and west, whilst displaying a complex system of rocky spurs and scree slopes to the south and east.
When viewed from the southeast, particularly on the main Keswick to Penrith road, Blencathra appears almost symmetrical. To left and right, the ends of the fell rise from the surrounding lowlands in smooth and sweeping curves, clad in rough grass. Each rises gracefully to a ridge-top summit, Blease Fell on the west and Scales Fell to the east. Between these ‘book-ends’ are a further three tops, Gategill Fell, Hallsfell and Doddick Fell, giving a scalloped profile to the ridge.

From each of the three central tops, a spur runs out at right angles to the main ridge, beginning as a narrow, rocky arête and then widening into a broad buttress which falls to the base of the fell. Separating the five tops are four streams which run down the south-east face between the spurs. From the west these are Blease Gill, Gate Gill, Doddick Gill and Scaley Beck.

In addition to the spurs on the southeast face, Hallsfell also throws out a high ridge to the north. This is the saddle that gives Blencathra its alternative name, rising beyond the dip to the sixth top, Atkinson Pike. This is the focal point for connecting ridges to Bannerdale Crags and Mungrisdale Common to the north. The ‘saddle’ is bounded by crags to the east, Tarn Crag and Foule Crag being the principal faces.

==Sharp Edge==
Between Tarn Crag and Foule Crag is Sharp Edge, an aptly named arête which provides one of the most famous scrambles in the area. Hiker and author Alfred Wainwright noted that: &quot;The crest itself is sharp enough for shaving (the former name was razor edge) and can be traversed only &quot;&quot; at some risk of damage to tender parts.&quot;


Below Tarn Crags is Scales Tarn, an almost circular waterbody filling a corrie. The bed plunges steeply to about and plants and fish are scarce.

To the east, beyond Scales Fell, is the connection to Souther Fell at Mousthwaite Comb. This ridge continues north-east to the vicinity of Mungrisdale, surrounded on all sides by the River Glenderamackin.

==Geology==
In common with much of the Northern Fells, the Kirk Stile Formation of the Skiddaw Group predominates. This is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone with greywacke sandstone and is of Ordovician age.

There has been considerable mining activity beneath the slopes of Blencathra. Threlkeld mine lies at the base of Hallsfell. From 1879 to 1928, it was a profitable venture for the raising of lead and zinc ores and is believed to hold further reserves should the economic situation improve.

A small trial working can be seen beside Blease Gill near the contour. This is believed to have been driven for lead.

Saddleback Old Mine had workings near Scales Tarn and at Mousthwaite Comb. The mine was driven for lead but in the 1890s raised mostly limonite. This was marketed unsuccessfully as a pigment and the mine closed in 1894.

In the Glenderaterra valley to the west of Blease Fell were Brundholme and Blencathra mines. Lead, copper and baryte were raised between the middle of the 19th century and the final closure in 1920.

The highest point is directly above the Hallsfell spur, marked by a trig point, in the form of a concrete ring. A good path connects the five summits on the main ridge, giving excellent views down the south-east face. Northward on the fine turf of the &#x27;saddle&#x27; is a large cross laid out in white stones. Its origin is uncertain, but extension to its current size (in excess of ) is attributed to a Harold Robinson of nearby Threlkeld, a frequent visitor in the years after the Second World War.

The view is very extensive, enhanced in every direction by the sharp fall of the slopes from the summit. To the west is the bulk of Skiddaw, and from west round to north-east the Back o’Skiddaw fells make up the foreground, backed by the mountains of Galloway, the Southern Uplands, the Border hills and the Cheviots.

The Pennines form the horizon from north-east to south-east, with Cross Fell, Mickle Fell, Wild Boar Fell and Great Whernside visible. To the south-east are the Far Eastern Fells and to the south the Helvellyn range is seen end-on, with vistas of the Forest of Bowland and North Wales to its left and right respectively.

The skyline from south to WSW is the best feature: a serrated skyline of all the major Lakeland peaks, these being, clockwise, Coniston Old Man, Crinkle Crags, Bowfell, Esk Pike, Scafell Pike, Great Gable, Kirk Fell, Pillar, High Stile, Grasmoor and Grisedale Pike. To the right of this, the Isle of Man and the Mourne Mountains are visible on clear days.

Derwent Water and Thirlmere are the major lakes visible; the most distant mountain visible is Slieve Meelmore in the Mourne Mountains in County Down, away.

==Ascents==
Blencathra is a popular mountain, and there are many different routes to the summit. One of the most famous is via Sharp Edge, a knife-edged arête on the eastern side of the mountain. Sharp Edge provides some good scrambling for those with a head for heights. Hall&#x27;s Fell ridge, on Blencathra&#x27;s southern flank, also provides an opportunity for some scrambling, though of a less serious nature. Alfred Wainwright described the ascent from Threlkeld via Hall&#x27;s Fell ridge as ‘&quot;positively&quot; the finest way to any mountain-top in the district’.

Wainwright recorded more routes of ascent for Blencathra than any other fell. Blease Fell and Scales Fell provided easy walking on grass and fast routes of descent. Gategill Fell he noted as dull until the final arête is reached, while Hallsfell and Doddick Fell both received praise. Of the intervening gills, Scaley Beck was reckoned the most practicable, the other three being overly rough and devoid of interest. An ascent from ‘behind’, beginning from Mungrisdale, was also described.

==Ownership==
In May 2014, its owner, Hugh Lowther, 8th Earl of Lonsdale, listed the entire mountain massif plus the Lordship of the Manor of Threlkeld for sale, at a guide price of £1.75 million. The sale was started in order to pay inheritance tax. A number of offers were soon made for the mountain, and the agent handling the sale suggested that the initial guide price could well be exceeded.

A community group, Friends of Blencathra, was set up in response to the announcement of the fell being listed for sale, and began fund-raising in order to make a bid. Mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington, broadcaster Melvyn Bragg and adventurer and television presenter Ben Fogle were among those to voice support for the group&#x27;s bid. The National Trust (which owns 21% of the Lake District National Park) also backed the Friends of Blencathra, stating that it would not be placing a bid itself.

Eden District Council listed Blencathra as an asset of community value on 7 July 2014, following a nomination by Friends of Blencathra. This was the first time the &#x27;community asset&#x27; status had been given to a mountain, and gave the community group more time to secure funding and negotiate with the owner.

In November 2015, the community group claimed to be making progress with the sale. Days later, H and H Land &amp; Property, the estate agents handling the sale of Blencathra, announced the mountain was no longer on the market, claiming it would not be available to purchase for an &#x27;indefinite&#x27; period of time. On 15 February 2016, Companies House published files confirming Friends of Blencathra had only raised £246,650 of the asking price in its first year of campaigning.

Due to a lack of &quot;serious&quot; offers, Blencathra was withdrawn from sale in May 2016, as the Earl had found other means of paying the tax. Following this, the Friends of Blencathra were given an ultimatum to make a final serious offer following concerns from donors that they would not see any result from the charity, and decided to end their campaign. Residual money from the fund disclaimed by contributors, totally around £100,000, was later donated to five selected local charities. The Friends of Blencathra was wound up in 2019.

==Other==

Blencathra Field Studies Centre is an outdoor and environmental education centre at an altitude of on the south-western side of Blencathra, at the foot of the ascent path to Blease Fell. It was built in 1904 and initially operated as a sanatorium. It now provides accommodation and learning opportunities for schools and universities, as well as specialist natural science training courses to adults. Since 2012 it has operated mostly off-grid, generating its own hydroelectricity and biomass heating.

In 2017, the Mountain Heritage Trust relocated its headquarters, and collections of objects and archives relating to British mountaineering, to the Blencathra Field Centre.

<doc id="1095311" wikidata="Q423586" url="?curid=1095311" title="Pentagastrin">
<text>Pentagastrin (trade name Peptavlon) is a synthetic polypeptide that has effects like gastrin when given ly. It stimulates the secretion of gastric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor, and has been used as a diagnostic aid as the pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test.

Pentagastrin binds to the cholecystokinin-B receptor, which is expressed widely in the brain. Activation of these receptors activates the phospholipase C second messenger system. When given intravenously it may cause panic attacks.

Pentagastrin&#x27;s IUPAC chemical name is &quot;N-((1,1-dimethylethoxy)carbonyl)-beta-alanyl-L-tryptophyl-L-methionyl-L-alpha-aspartyl-L-phenylalaninamide&quot;.

==Pentagastrin stimulation test==
Pentagastrin is also used as a stimulation test to elevate of several hormones, such as serotonin. It provokes flushing and is useful in evaluating patients who describe flushing, but have normal or only marginally elevated biochemical markers for carcinoid syndrome.

It has been used to stimulate ectopic gastric mucosa for the detection of Meckels diverticulum by nuclear medicine.

===Calcitonin test===
The pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test is a diagnostic test for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC). MTC is a malignancy of the calcitonin-secreting cells of the thyroid gland, and thus MTC is commonly associated with an elevated calcitonin level, but an elevated level may not always be obvious. The pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test is useful in cases of suspected MTC that are not associated with elevated calcitonin. In these patients, injecting pentagastrin will cause calcitonin levels to rise significantly above the normal or basal range. After a total thyroidectomy for medullary thyroid carcinoma, the pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin release can be used to detect residual parafollicular C-cells.

<text>A smart bullet is a bullet that is able to do something other than simply follow its given trajectory, such as turning, changing speed or sending data. Such a projectile may be fired from a precision-guided firearm capable of programming its behavior. It is a miniaturized type of precision-guided munition.

==Types of smart bullets==
In 2008 the EXACTO program began under DARPA to develop a &quot;fire and forget&quot; smart sniper rifle system including a guided smart bullet and improved scope. The exact technologies of this smart bullet have yet to be released. EXACTO was test fired in 2014 and 2015 and results showing the bullet alter course to correct its path to its target were released.

In 2012 Sandia National Laboratories announced a self-guided bullet prototype that could track a target illuminated with a laser designator. The bullet is capable of updating its position 30 times a second and hitting targets over a mile away.

In mid-2016, Russia revealed it was developing a similar &quot;smart bullet&quot; weapon designed to hit targets at a distance of up to .

== Guided bullet ==
The guided bullet was conceptualized by Dr. Rolin F. Barrett, Jr. and patented in August 1998.

As first designed, the bullet would have three fiber-optic based eyes (at minimum, for three-dimensionality), evenly distributed about its circumference. To activate its guided nature, a laser is pointed at a target. As the bullet approaches its final destination, it adjusts its flight path in real time to allow an equivalent amount of light from the laser to enter each eye. The bullet would not travel in multiple directions as though it were an autonomous vehicle, but instead, would make small adjustments to its flight path to hit the target precisely where the laser was placed. Moreover, the laser would not have to originate from the source of the bullet, allowing the projectile to be fired at a target beyond visual range.

To allow the bullet to modify its flight path, the body was designed as a metal and polymer combination. The polymer would act as a deformable surface that would deflect the air-stream and steer the bullet in real time. The guidance system is powered by a miniature lithium-polymer battery that is connected to the navigational circuits.

Barrett went to great lengths to model the airflow of the bullet, studying butterflies with speed bumps to evaluate the effects of protruding surfaces. Due to a lack of ballistic programs at the time, custom simulations were written in Mathcad to solve for numerous flight variables. In addition to modeling the flight, the interior ballistics were modeled by continuously altering polynomial curves until they were in agreement with publicly available data. Due to a lack of available terminal ballistics data that would have been representative of the guided bullet, the data was compared to that of large game hunting bullets.

==Changing trajectory==
One kind of smart bullet is a projectile that is capable of changing its course during flight. One use of this would be to enable soldiers to stay behind protective cover and shoot around corners. One implementation uses a spoiler and micro gyro to control the bullet.

==Navigating==
Honeywell Aerospace has produced inertial measurement units based on MEMS and microelectronics technologies that it claims can survive the shock of being fired out of a gun.

==Transmitting data==
Another type of smart bullet is one that can transmit data about the location that has been hit. A prototype has been created by researchers at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, USA with funding from Lockheed Martin. The bullet (projectile) has the capability to send data up to a distance of 70 meters.

<doc id="1095328" wikidata="Q875241" url="?curid=1095328" title="Neo-orthodoxy">
<text>In Christianity, Neo-orthodoxy or Neoorthodoxy, also known as theology of crisis and dialectical theology, was a theological movement developed in the aftermath of the First World War. The movement was largely a reaction against doctrines of 19th century liberal theology and a reevaluation of the teachings of the Reformation. Karl Barth is the leading figure associated with the movement. In the U.S., Reinhold Niebuhr was a leading exponent of neo-orthodoxy. It is unrelated to Eastern Orthodoxy.

==Revelation==
Neo-orthodoxy strongly emphasises the revelation of God by God as the source of Christian doctrine. This is in contrast to natural theology; the issue remains a controversial topic within some circles of Christianity to this day.

Barth totally rejects natural theology. As Thomas F. Torrance wrote:
Emil Brunner, on the other hand, believed that natural theology still had an important, although not decisive, role. This led to a sharp disagreement between the two men, the first of several controversies that prevented the movement from acquiring a unified, homogeneous character.

==Transcendence of God==
Most neo-orthodox thinkers stressed the transcendence of God. Barth believed that the emphasis on the immanence of God had led human beings to imagine God to amount to nothing more than humanity writ large. He stressed the &quot;infinite qualitative distinction&quot; between the human and the divine, a reversion to older Protestant teachings on the nature of God and a rebuttal against the intellectual heritage of philosophical idealism. This led to a general devaluation of philosophical and metaphysical approaches to the faith, although some thinkers, notably Paul Tillich, attempted a median course between strict transcendence and ontological analysis of the human condition, a stand that caused a further division in the movement.

==Existentialism==
Some of the neo-orthodox theologians made use of existentialism. Rudolf Bultmann (who was associated with Barth and Brunner in the 1920s in particular) was strongly influenced by his former colleague at Marburg, the German existentialist philosopher Martin Heidegger.

Reinhold Niebuhr and (to a lesser extent, and mostly in his earlier writings) Karl Barth, on the other hand, were influenced by the writings of the 19th century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard was a critic of the then-fashionable liberal Christian modernist effort to &quot;rationalise&quot; Christianity—to make it palatable to those whom Friedrich Schleiermacher termed the &quot;cultured despisers of religion&quot;. Instead, under pseudonyms such as Johannes Climacus, Kierkegaard maintained that Christianity is &quot;absurd&quot; (i.e., it transcends human understanding) and presents the individual with paradoxical choices. The decision to become a Christian, Kierkegaard thought, is not fundamentally rational but passional—a leap of faith. Opponents of Kierkegaard&#x27;s approach and neo-orthodoxy in general have termed this fideism, a blatant refusal to find support for the faith outside its own circles. For the most part, proponents reply that no such support exists, that supposed reasons and evidences for faith are fabrications of fallen human imagination, and in effect constitute idolatry. Some neo-orthodox proponents have gone so far as to claim greater affinity with atheists in that regard than with the theological and cultural trappings of so-called &quot;Christendom&quot;, which Kierkegaard venomously denounced in his later works.

==Sin and human nature==
In neo-orthodoxy, sin is seen not as mere error or ignorance; it is not something that can be overcome by reason or social institutions (e.g., schools); it can only be overcome by the grace of God through Jesus Christ. Sin is seen as something bad within human nature itself. This amounts to a renovation of historical teachings about original sin (especially drawing upon Augustine of Hippo), although thinkers generally avoided forensic interpretations of it and consequential elaborations about total depravity. The means of supposed transmission of sin, to neo-orthodox minds, is not as important as its pervasive reality. The association of original sin with sexuality—an abiding idea—leads to moralism, a rectitude that is overly optimistic about human capabilities to resist the power of unfaith and disobedience in all areas of life, not just sexual behavior. This core conviction about the universality and intransigence of sin has elements of determinism, and has not surprisingly offended those who think people are capable, wholly or in part, of effecting their own salvation (i.e., synergism). In other words, neo-orthodoxy might be said to have a greater appreciation of tragedy in human existence than either conservatism or liberalism, a point emphasized by a latter-day interpreter of the movement, Canadian theologian Douglas John Hall.

== Relation to other theologies ==
Neo-orthodoxy is distinct from both liberal Protestantism and evangelicalism, but, notwithstanding some interpreters, it cannot properly be considered a mediating position between the two. Neo-orthodoxy draws from various Protestant heritages (primarily Lutheran and Calvinist) in an attempt to rehabilitate dogma outside the restraints of Enlightenment thought. Unlike confessionalist or fundamentalist reactions to individualist approaches to the faith, however, neo-orthodox adherents saw no value in rehabilitating tradition for its own sake. Past Protestant doctrine is used only to the degree that it affirms the living Word of God in Jesus Christ. Propositions in and of themselves, whether from the Bible or not, are, to the neo-orthodox, insufficient to build theology upon. Also, in the pursuit of social justice, intellectual freedom, and honesty, the neo-orthodox, unlike the conservatives they were accused by detractors of resembling, often made practical alliances with liberals. Both groups shared a deep hostility to authoritarianism of any kind, in both church and state.

The breadth of the term &quot;neo-orthodox&quot;, though, has led to its abandonment as a useful classification, especially after new emphases in mainline Protestant theology appeared during the 1960s. These included the &quot;Death of God&quot; movement, which attacked the linguistic and cultural foundations of all previous theology, and a renewal of interest among Biblical scholars in the &quot;historical Jesus&quot;, something neo-orthodox theologians largely dismissed as irrelevant to serious Christian faith. Still, some of the movement&#x27;s positions and worldviews would inform such later movements as liberation theology during the 1970s and 1980s and post-liberalism during the 1990s and 2000s—in spite of theological and ethical differences from both (i.e., liberationist use of Marxist conceptual analysis and narrativist dependence upon virtue theory).

==Influence upon American Protestantism==
From its inception, this school of thought has largely been unacceptable to Protestant fundamentalism, as neo-orthodoxy generally accepts biblical criticism; has remained mostly silent on the perceived conflicts caused by evolutionary science; and, in espousing these two viewpoints, it retains at least some aspects of 19th-century liberal theology.

==Critical assessment==
Neo-orthodoxy was originally met with criticism by fellow Protestant theologians in Germany: Ferdinand Kattenbusch accused Barth of being a reactionary theologian, who wanted to overthrow the fruits that liberal theology acquired since the end of the 18th century, while Paul Tillich saw Barth as a &quot;kerygmatic theologian&quot; who wanted to derive the contents of his theology solely from the Bible without regard for the &quot;situation&quot;. Such views started to be abandoned after Friedrich-Wilhelm Marquardt proposed instead that Barth&#x27;s theology was in fact the product of his activity on behalf of the working classes in his Safenwil parish. Such a view proved controversial and is nowadays rarely defended, but led to the demise of the traditional view on neo-orthodoxy held in German circles.

According to Bruce L. McCormack (Princeton Theological Seminary) the acceptance of Barth&#x27;s theology in the English-speaking world only happened after a &quot;process of normalization&quot; which adjusted Barth&#x27;s theology in accordance with more traditional norms.

<text>Jim Higgins (born 4 May 1945) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician. He served as a member of Seanad Éireann, Dáil Éireann, and was a European People&#x27;s Party Member of the European Parliament for the North-West constituency from 2004 to 2014.

==Early life==
He was born in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo in 1945. He was educated at St. Jarlath&#x27;s College, Tuam and at University College Galway. He was twice named Best Individual Speaker at the Junior Chamber Ireland debating championships (1978, 1979) and was the captain of the International Tripartite Debating Team. Higgins worked as a secondary school teacher before becoming involved in local politics.

==Political career==

He served as a member of Mayo County Council from 1979 to 1995, acting as vice-chair of the council from 1980 to 1981. He first ran for Dáil Éireann at the 1981 general election, but was unsuccessful. However, he was nominated by the Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald to the 15th Seanad Éireann.

He lost his Seanad seat in 1982 but was elected to the 17th Seanad by the Labour Panel in 1983, remaining in the upper house until 1987 as a member of the 17th Seanad. He was successful at the 1987 general election, winning a seat in the 25th Dáil as a Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) for Mayo East. He was re-elected to the Dáil in 1989, 1992 and 1997.

<text>Elazığ Province (; ; ) is a province of Turkey with its seat in the city of Elazığ. Its area is 9,383 km2, and its population is 591,497 (2022). The population of the province was 569,616 in 2000 and 498,225 in 1990. The province is considered part of Turkish Kurdistan and has a Kurdish majority with a significant Turkish minority.

== History ==
In 1927 the office of the Inspector General was created, which governed with martial law. The province was included in the first Inspectorate General (&quot;Umumi Müfettişlik&quot;, UM) over which the Inspector General ruled. The UM span over the provinces of Hakkâri, Siirt, Van, Mardin, Bitlis, Şanlıurfa, Elazığ and Diyarbakır.

In December 1935, the Tunceli Law was passed, which demanded a more powerful Government in the region. In January 1936 the Elazığ Province was transferred under the authority of the newly established Fourth Inspectorate General, which span over the provinces of Elazığ, Erzincan, Bingöl and Tunceli and its seat was in the city of Elazığ. The fourth UM was governed by a Governor-Commander. Most of the employees in the municipalities had to be from the military and the Governor-Commander had the authority to evacuate whole villages and resettle them in another part of the province. In 1946 the Tunceli Law was abolished and the state of emergency removed but the authority of the fourth UM was transferred to the military.

The Inspectorates General were dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.

<text>Runemagick is a Swedish death/doom band formed in 1990. The band was started by Nicklas &quot;Terror&quot; Rudolfsson under the name Desiderius, which was quickly changed to Runemagic. First, the band consisted solely of Rudolfsson, but he was later joined by Robert &quot;Reaper&quot; Pehrsson. They started out as a pure death metal band but later incorporated doom metal influences, inspired by the likes of Bathory, Treblinka/Tiamat, Celtic Frost, Nihilist/Entombed, and Candlemass.

After a few demos the band fell apart in 1993. Rudolfsson restored Runemagic in 1997 with Fredrik Johnsson on guitar and Peter Palmdahl on bass; he also added the &quot;k&quot; to the name (see also magick). A rehearsal demo with Nicklas on drums was recorded and sent to Century Media Records, which got them a record deal for three albums. After many line-up changes, in 2000, the band parted with Century Media and eventually landed on the Norwegian label Aftermath Music.

After the album &quot;Dawn of the End&quot; (2007) the band went into a long hiatus but resumed in 2017. In 2018, the band recorded and released a new album, &quot;Evoked From Abysmal Sleep&quot;, released by Aftermath Music, Parasitic Records and Flowing Downwards. The band also played live first the first time since 2005 at Kill-Town Deathfest in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The Highlander Mountain Marathon which began in 2007 and was held in April at a Scottish location &#x27;within a 2 hour drive of Inverness&#x27; has now come to an end.

New competitors can receive training from various organization for example Trail Running Scotland.

The start arrangements on the two days are usually different (and are designed to encourage navigational independence).
For example, on day 1 of the SLMM a staggered start is used, with teams being sent off at 1 or 2 minute intervals, and not getting their way-cards until they are &#x27;on the clock&#x27;.
On Day 2 the overnight leaders are often sent off half an hour before the others (a &#x27;chasing start&#x27;) and a mass start, for those more than half an hour behind overnight, then follows.

The races have provided the stimulus for various items of specialist lightweight equipment, for instance lightweight tents and multipouched running rucksacks (the &#x27;OMM Classic Marathon 25 or 32 Sac&#x27;).

<doc id="1095378" wikidata="Q5447106" url="?curid=1095378" title="Field of Mars Reserve">
<text>The Field of Mars Reserve is a protected nature reserve located on the northern suburbs of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The 50 Hectare (123.5 acres) reserve is a remnant of bushland situated between the Lane Cove and Parramatta rivers within the suburb of East Ryde and near Gladesville, Hunters Hill and Ryde.

==Features==
The name Field of Mars was given by Governor Arthur Phillip, when in January 1792 he granted to two marines the first parcels of land, later expanded to eight parcels in this district. There are a number of theories on the origin of the name, the first is that it was a direct reference to the Roman God of war and the marines&#x27; service in the colony. The second theory is that it is named after the Roman Campus Martius, which also has a military connection. The third theory is that it is named after the Champ de Mars in Paris, again with military connections. The name was later used on the parish in the area, which is still today used on land titles. The area became known initially as the Field of Mars Common.

The reserve was a gazetted as a wildlife refuge in 1979 under the and features considerable flora and fauna and contains an environmental education centre. The reserve adjoins the Field of Mars Cemetery, bounded by Strangers Creek in the north and Wellington Road in the south.

The Field of Mars Fires devastated part of the reserve by bushfires in 2002.

The Sydney suburb of derives its name from the reserve.

<doc id="1095392" wikidata="Q1233610" url="?curid=1095392" title="Hugh Coveney">
<text>Hugh Coveney (20 July 1935 – 14 March 1998) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister of State at the Department of Finance from 1996 to 1997, Minister for the Marine and Minister for Defence from 1994 to 1995 and Lord Mayor of Cork from 1982 to 1983. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cork South-Central constituency from 1981 to 1982, 1982 to 1987 and 1994 to 1998.

==Early life==
Coveney was born into one of Cork&#x27;s prosperous &quot;merchant prince&quot; families in 1935. He was educated at Christian Brothers College, Cork, Clongowes Wood College and the College of Estate Management, London. He worked as a chartered quantity surveyor in his father&#x27;s surveying firm, Patrick F. Coveney Associates (later P. F. Coveney &amp; Son). He was subsequently a fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. He married Pauline Brown in 1969; and they had six sons and one daughter.

==Political career==
Coveney served as Lord Mayor of Cork from 1982 to 1983. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for the Cork South-Central constituency at the 1981 general election. He lost his seat in the first general election of 1982 but regained it in the second election in the same year. He lost his seat again at the 1987 general election and did not contest the 1989 or 1992 general elections. He was elected to the Dáil again in the 1994 Cork South-Central by-election caused by the resignation of the Progressive Democrats TD Pat Cox.

He was appointed to cabinet in December 1994 under Taoiseach John Bruton as Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine. However, he was demoted to a junior ministry in May 1995 after allegations of improper contact with businessmen. It was revealed that he had made a telephone call to Bord Gáis asking that his family firm be considered for a state contract.

==Yachting==
Coveney&#x27;s yacht &quot;Golden Apple of The Sun&quot; (designed by Cork-based designer Ron Holland) was a successful competitor in the Admiral&#x27;s Cup in the 1970s.

A later yacht &quot;Golden Apple&quot; was used by the family for the &quot;Sail Chernobyl&quot; project. The family sailed around the world to raise €650,000 for the Chernobyl Children&#x27;s Project, a charity which offers assistance to children affected by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

==Death==
In March 1998, it became publicly known that the Moriarty Tribunal had questioned Coveney about whether he had a secret offshore account with Ansbacher Bank, a bank which had become notorious for facilitating tax-evasion. Ten days later, on 13 March 1998, Coveney visited his solicitor to change his will. The next day, 14 March 1998, Coveney died in a fall from a seaside cliff while out walking alone. His son, Simon Coveney, insisted that his father had never held an Ansbacher account. It later emerged that Hugh Coveney had $175,000 on deposit in the secret Cayman Island-based bank. The account was closed in 1979.

His son, Simon, was elected a TD to succeed his father in the resulting by-election on 3 November 1998.

<text>Spang is a village in Germany, north of Trier between Bitburg and Wittlich. This village was first mentioned in 1254. It is on one side of the Spanger brook while on the other side is the village of Dahlem. These two villages eventually became a single municipality Spangdahlem as they are known today. The locals still refer themselves to being from Spang or Dalhem. After World War II the USAF located a currently operating fighter airbase in the area of Spangdalhem.

Many of the Spang families in the USA, Germany and South America have traced their roots to this area. Generally speaking most people used their first names for identification as surnames where not important for identification. In Germany when someone left their village or city they were known as &quot;name&quot; von (from) village i.e. Joseph von Spang was Joseph from the village of Spang. Over time the von was dropped and the person was now known as Joseph Spang and Spang became their surname. Earliest recorded von Spang was Nicholaus von Spang who married Elizabeth Bernardos (Sic) 18 Jan 1581 in St Gangolf Catholic church in Trier, Germany.</text><links>

<doc id="1095397" wikidata="Q3525671" url="?curid=1095397" title="Thomas Willett">
<text>Thomas Willett (August 29, 1674) was a Plymouth Colony fur trader, merchant, land purchaser and developer, Captain of the Plymouth Colony militia, Magistrate of the colony, and was the 1st and 3rd Mayor of New York, prior to the consolidation of the five boroughs into the City of New York in 1898.

==Career==

===Plymouth Colony Fur Trade===

The early years of the Plymouth Colony were marked by severe economic crises and challenges. Incremental progress was made as the colonists learned the Native Americans&#x27; method of raising corn and beans, cattle were imported from England and multiplied, and some trade in wampum and other goods was established. However, the major contribution to placing the colony on a firm financial basis and finally paying its debt to its financial &quot;Adventurers&quot; in London was made by exporting furs, primarily of beaver to be used in making hats.

The first record of Willett&#x27;s long career is probably that of William Bradford regarding the establishment of a second main trading post for the Plymouth Colony on the Penobscot River in what is now Maine in 1629. The Plymouth Colony was reluctantly joining in this effort, initiated by Isaac Allerton, in order to protect their established trading post on the Kennebunk River. Willett is thought to be the &quot;honest young man&quot; recently arrived with the second and last major group from John Robinson&#x27;s Leyden congregation who was given the task of monitoring the activities of Edward Ashley, the man placed in charge of the trading post by Allerton. This &quot;young man being discreet, and one (Willett) whom they could trust, they so instructed as kept Ashley ... within bounds&quot;. It is definitely known that Willett, among others, was deposed and Ashley and the depositions were transported to England for trial in July 1631 after Ashley was arrested and accused of trading arms and ammunition with Native Americans.

In 1631, the trading post was robbed of just about anything of value by the French while the &quot;master of the house&quot; was away meeting a supply ship. Willett was in charge of the trading post when the French again robbed it in 1635 and evicted the English; a subsequent effort to recapture it using a ship commanded by a Captain Girling was futile, and the colony gave up the Penobscot post permanently. An account of the expulsion of the English from Penobscot and the subsequent attempt to regain it from the French point of view exists in a letter from Sieur D&#x27;Aulney to Governor John Endecott of Massachusetts. Willett&#x27;s early and continuing experiences in the fur trade provided valuable skills in native languages and frontier trade for use in his later career.

Willett remained active in the colony&#x27;s remaining fur trading efforts, including being appointed to a committee in 1637 to advise the governor concerning the decline in the trade, and in 1649 and again in 1656, with others, taking over the remaining trading post on the Kennebunk River. He probably spent little time at the Kennebunk River trading post given his other activities, but Winthrop recorded one incident where a potential theft or worse by some Native Americans was thwarted by Willett in 1639.

===Landowner in Plymouth===

Willett was &quot;Admitted to the freedom of this society&quot; (i.e., recognized as a full citizen, or &quot;freeman&quot;) in 1633/4 and married Mary Browne on July 6, 1636. He received several grants of land from the colony in 1638/9 and 1640 plus six acres in 1640 for a houselot. As the years passed, he assumed more and more responsibility in the colony including becoming the co-captain of the colony&#x27;s military company (with Myles Standish) in 1647/8; he remained in this post after Standish retired and for almost all of the remainder of his life. His initial appointment as Assistant to the Governor was in 1651; and he was reappointed to that post many times in the following years.

===Merchant and Land Development===
Willett&#x27;s initial beginning as a merchant in addition to the continuing involvement in the fur trade may have come in 1641/2 when he furnished a sixteenth portion of the construction cost to build a 40–50 ton bark (ship). In time he became the major merchant in the lucrative trade with the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (later New York) where his early knowledge of the Dutch language and customs was of great advantage. His later merchant activities included at least some trade with Virginia and across the Atlantic.

Willett&#x27;s abilities in the native languages led to his becoming a trusted translator and to establishing friendships among the Native Americans, particularly with the principal leaders of the Pokanokets, who were led successively by Massasoit, and his sons Wamsutta (or Alexander) and Metacom (known as Prince Phillip). (The Pokanokets today are usually referred to as members of a larger group of Native Americans, the Wampanoag.) The colony&#x27;s desire for more land to accommodate its growing population and the desire for more economic activity, combined with the Pokanokets&#x27; desire for English goods, led to a series of land purchases from them, notably in the western part of the colony. Willett&#x27;s father-in-law, John Browne, was among the founders of Taunton in 1640, and Browne&#x27;s and Willett&#x27;s involvement continued in further purchases along and near the eastern coast and northern reaches of Narragansett Bay. Willett had moved to this western area of the colony and became involved in the affairs of Rehoboth by the early 1650s, serving in numerous capacities, particularly after the death of Browne in 1662. Willett was authorized to purchase further land from the Native Americans in 1662 and again in 1668 and 1669; these purchases led enlargement of Rehoboth and Swansey (Swansea, originally Wannamoisett). An example of a deed between the Native Americans and a group of purchasers involving Browne and Willett can be found in a history of the town of Swansea. An extensive history of the early land purchases in Pokanoket area, including those involving Willett, has been compiled by Bicknell including a map showing historical names.

Willett became a part owner with other prominent men, including his father-in-law and a son-in-law, John Saffin, of a large development consortium, the Atherton Company, leading to interests in properties in a number of the early New England towns. Willett was appointed with others to settle a dispute between the colonies of Plymouth and Rhode Island over ownership of Hog Island in Narragansett Bay in 1658/9.

Willett&#x27;s trade with New Nederland led to further involvement with that colony. In 1650 he was entrusted, along with the English secretary to Peter Stuyvesant, to represent New Nederland in settling its border with the English colony of Connecticut (this link shows the 1650 boundary established, along with those of later surveys, see also New Haven Colony).

===English Acquisition of New Amsterdam from the Dutch===

Accompanying the English commander Richard Nicolls, Willett contributed to the peaceable surrender of New Amsterdam to the English on September 7, 1664. Willett had informed the Dutch that an expedition by the English was pending, and he was a member of the English party that entered New Amsterdam under a flag of truce on September 2 to attempt to persuade Governor Stuyvesant and the Dutch to surrender peacefully. This eventually happened.

Largely because of his knowledge of the native languages, Willett very soon thereafter accompanied a successful negotiating party north to the Iroquois to secure for the English the excellent relations that the Iroquois had maintained with the Dutch. Colonel Richard Nicholls, who was given command of the transfer from Dutch to English governance, sent a request to Thomas Prence, then governor of the Plymouth Colony, that Willett be relieved of his duties to that colony so that he could assist in the transfer. His letter stated that &quot;Mr. Willett was more acquainted with the manners and customs of the Dutch than any English man in the country, and that his conversation was very acceptable to them&quot;. This request was granted and Willett resigned his official duties with Plymouth.

When the colony was reorganized with the name of New York, Willett was appointed the first mayor of the town (June 1665) with the approval of the English and Dutch alike; he had apparently maintained a residence in New Amsterdam for some years in addition to his long-establish trading relationships. The next year he was elected alderman, and became mayor again for another year in mid-1667. He was a member of the New York governor&#x27;s executive council at times from 1665 to 1672 under Francis Lovelace.

===Return to Plymouth and legacy===

One of the greatest services Willett provided to the colony for many years, along with his father-in-law John Browne, was maintenance of good relations with the Pokanokets whose main village was near Rehoboth, close to Mt. Hope. The relations with the colony soured with Willett&#x27;s absences to New York and for his other merchant activities, and even more so after his death. The military affairs of the colony were increasingly assumed by Josiah Winslow, who pursued a much more aggressive approach. Alexander, Massasoit&#x27;s eldest son who had become the leader of the Pokanokets, died while in the custody of Winslow in 1662. Philip, the next eldest son, then became the Pokanoket&#x27;s leader; relations eventually deteriorated to the point of open warfare between the English colonies and most of the New England tribes in 1675. This became known as King Philip&#x27;s War.

After his first term as New York mayor, Willett apparently spent time in Rehoboth in early 1667 where he was appointed Captain of the town&#x27;s militia and was the principal in the establishment of the Township of Swansea. Swansea was originally part of Rehoboth; they divided after a Baptist congregation originally led by Obadiah Holmes, and subsequently by John Myles, arose and had differences with the existing congregation of the town. Among other things, the members of the Baptist congregation were heavily fined for setting up their own congregation and not attending services at the established church. After Swansea was officially recognized, a small group led by Willett was given control over who was allowed to set up residence in the new town. Although Willett&#x27;s brother-in-law, James Browne, was probably the most prominent lay member of the Baptist congregation, and Willett was deeply involved in establishing it as a separate and recognized congregation, Willett actually may not have been a member of the congregation. Such limited religious tolerance evidently was not extended to Quakers; Willett reportedly was among a group of magistrates condoning a severe whipping of two Quakers in 1658.

After having lost his first wife, Willett married Joanna Boyse in September 1671.

Willett was a given a &quot;halbert&quot; (halberd) in December 1673 when an expedition against the Dutch in New Orange was contemplated. The Dutch had briefly conquered New York and changed the name to New Orange (the name reverted to New York after the Dutch signed a peace treaty in February 1674). This is the last record of Willett&#x27;s activity in the colony.

Willett left a large estate as evidenced by the inventory compiled for probate. When the Dutch recaptured New York in 1673, Willet&#x27;s holdings along with those of the other English landowners there were confiscated; he died shortly thereafter and these holdings were never restored. Even with these losses, Willett died one of the wealthiest men in the colony as can be seen from the lengthy inventory. Although no record appears to exist indicating that Willett participated in the slave trade, the inventory of his estate indicates ownership of eight negro slaves when he died. The Plymouth court later decided to grant freedom after two years additional service to one of Willett&#x27;s slaves who had been taken prisoner during King Philip&#x27;s war and later returned to Willett&#x27;s heirs. Willett&#x27;s will left the bulk of his estate to be divided among his sons (including Samuel Hooker, married to his daughter, Mary), along with more minor bequests to his unmarried daughters, grandchildren, an old servant, schools, churches, and the pastor, John Myles. Willett&#x27;s will was made in April 1671, prior to his second marriage.

===Ancestry and Transport===
The origins of Thomas Willett are not known for certain and are subject to some debate. The most commonly encountered description of his early life from the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; describes him as the fourth son of the English clergyman Andrew Willet. The germ of this description may have come from the pedigree of Willett&#x27;s descendants published in 1848, which offered the theory that this Thomas may have descended from Andrew Willet because the Willett name is rare. A differing opinion exists in Dexter&#x27;s compilation of the Leyden congregation in the appendix of his work, &quot;England and Holland of the Pilgrims&quot;. This indicates that Willett was the son of Thomas and Alice Willet of the Leyden congregation. The respective merits of these opinions are discussed by Burgess.

There is general agreement that Willett came over to the Plymouth Colony with the second wave of the Leyden congregation in 1629. There is disagreement however over whether or not he went back to England shortly thereafter for the trial of Edward Ashley who was accused of trading weapons and ammunition to Native Americans. The evidence that this might have been the case is based upon a listing of passengers on the ship Lyon which sailed from London on June 22, 1632, with William Pierce as Master as given by Charles Edward Banks in his &quot;Planters of the Commonwealth&quot;. This list includes Thomas Willett along with the family of his future father-in-law, John Browne, including Willett&#x27;s future wife, Mary. However, an examination of the original source material by Samuel Gardner Drake, published in 1860, indicates that the original record for the ship sailing to England on that date listed only a few names of the passengers, including only a &quot;Tobie&quot; Willet and a &quot;Jo:&quot; Browne (but no other Brownes). This and the indication that only the depositions of Willett and others accompanied Ashley back to England for his trial are contrary to Banks&#x27; passenger list.

===Family in the Plymouth Colony and Descendants===

Willett&#x27;s parents and siblings were evidently left behind when he emigrated to Plymouth in 1629. His family life thereafter centered around that of his wife&#x27;s family. Willett married Mary, daughter of John Browne (Sr.), a leading citizen of the Plymouth Colony, and Browne&#x27;s wife, Dorothy, in 1636. He moved with the Brown(e) family from Plymouth westward, originally to the Taunton area by the 1650s, and later to the eastern shores of Narragansett Bay to Wannamoisett, near present-day Barrington, Rhode Island. Willett had substantial business dealings with Browne (Sr.) and later increasingly, especially between 1656 and 1660 when Browne (Sr.) is believed to have been in England, with Browne&#x27;s two sons, John (Jr.) and James. Another family connection was with Willett&#x27;s early co-worker in the fur trade, John Howland. Howland&#x27;s daughter, Lydia, married James Browne and Howland&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth, was living with James and Lydia Broowne&#x27;s family when she died. Both John Browne (Sr.) and John Browne (Jr.) died in 1662, the son ten days before the father.

The children of Thomas and Mary Willet, as compiled from several sources, were:

*Mary, b. November 10, 1637, d. June 24, 1712, married Rev. Samuel Hooker (son of Rev. Thomas Hooker) in 1658, remarried Rev. Thomas Buckingham in 1703.
*Martha, b. August 6, 1639, d. 1678, married John Saffin in 1658.
*John, b. August 21, 1641, d. February 2, 1663/4, married Abigail Collins in 1663.
*Sarah, b. May 4, 1643, d. June 13, 1665, married Rev. John Eliot (son of Rev. John Eliot).
*Rebecca, b. December 2, 1644, d. April 2, 1652.
*Thomas, b. October 1, 1646, d. before 1671(?).
*Hester, b. July 6, 1648, d. July 26, 1737, married Rev. Josiah Flint.
*James, b. November 24, 1649, married Elizabeth Hunt (daughter of Peter Hunt) in 1673, remarried Grace Frinck in 1677.
*Hezekiah, b. June 20, 1651, d. July 26, 1651.
*Hezekiah, b. November 16, 1653, d. July 1, 1676, married Ann (or Hannah) Browne (daughter of John Brown (Jr.)) in 1675.
*David, b. November 1, 1654, d. before 1671(?).
*Andrew, b. October 5, 1656, d. April 6, 1712, married Ann Coddington in 1682 (daughter of William and Ann Coddington).
*Samuel, b. October 27, 1658.

(?) Sons John, Thomas, and David are not mentioned in Willett&#x27;s will which calls James the &quot;eldest son&quot;.

There is disagreement over Thomas Willett&#x27;s date and place of birth. The &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; states that he was born in England in 1605. Willett&#x27;s will, dated April 26, 1671, says he was then &quot;being going in the sixty-fourth year of my age&quot; (i.e., he was 63 years old, born between April 27, 1607, and April 27, 1608, prior to the migration to the Netherlands later in 1608 which included those who later became the Leyden congregation). His original gravestone also stated that he died &quot;in the 64th year of his age&quot; in 1674 (i.e., he was born in 1610 or 1611) and this is in agreement with the range given in Dexter&#x27;s listing for the Willet family in Holland. The respective merits of these opinions are discussed by Burgess. Willet died August 4, 1674, and was buried in the Little Neck Cemetery at Bullock&#x27;s Cove, Riverside area of East Providence, Rhode Island.

Mary Willett, the first wife of Thomas, died on January 8, 1669, at about 55 years old making her birthdate about 1614, almost certainly in England. Her grave is next to that of Thomas Willett. Little mention is found of her in the records; what is there includes her marriage to Thomas on July 6, 1636, and she is also mentioned in connection with her father&#x27;s will which was hastily written while he was ill in the short period between his son&#x27;s death and his own. The will of John Browne (Sr.) made scant reference to his daughter, Mary, no significant bequest to her, and none at all to her offspring. Browne&#x27;s objective may have been to leave his property to the relatively more needy members of his family rather than to those of Mary&#x27;s branch, as she was married to one of the wealthiest men in the colony. However this might have been, Browne&#x27;s intent could have been better expressed and the result was an unusual mention in the colony&#x27;s records regarding Mary Willett&#x27;s good relationship with her father.

Joanna Prudden, widow of Rev. Peter Prudden and second wife of Thomas Willett, married Willett in Milford, Connecticut, on September 20, 1671. After Willett&#x27;s death in 1674, she soon returned to Milford and remarried again, this time to Rev. John Bishop. She was born in Halifax, Yorkshire, England, in 1616 and died on November 8, 1681, in Stamford, Connecticut.

Mary Willett, eldest daughter of Capt. Thomas Willett and his wife Mary, married in 1658 Rev. Samuel Hooker, son of Rev. Thomas Hooker, Puritan divine and founder of Hartford, Connecticut.

There is some thought that Willett&#x27;s son, Thomas Willett (Jr.), was the major in the militia of Queens County who was a councilor under Governors Sir Edmund Andros and Henry Sloughter. According to Hillman it is probable that this Major Thomas Willett was actually a member of another Willett family which had settled on Long Island. They were possibly cousins of the Thomas Willett who is the subject of this article.

Hezekiah Willett was killed during King Philip&#x27;s War in spite of the special consideration which was supposed to be extended to the Browne/Willett family by Philip&#x27;s followers. This was a source of great sorrow to Philip as reported by the servant captured when Hezekiah was killed (this probably was the slave later ordered freed by the colony&#x27;s court). This incident also exasperated the Plymouth colonists; special punishments were eventually meted out to Hezekiah&#x27;s killers.

Andrew Willett spent most of his adult life near what is now Kingston, Rhode Island. He married Ann Coddington, daughter of William Coddington, a governor of Rhode Island. Thomas Willett&#x27;s interests in the Atherton Company led to ownership of land in this area of Rhode Island, then known as the &quot;Boston Neck&quot;, along with other company shareholders who over time banded together as merchants, which included Thomas Willett&#x27;s son, Andrew. Some confusion exists in the records distinguishing between the Boston Neck area of Rhode Island and Boston, Massachusetts.

Some have claimed that one of Willett&#x27;s great-grandsons was Marinus Willett, who also served as Mayor of New York from 1807 to 1808, assuming that Willett&#x27;s son, Samuel, settled on Long Island where he became Sheriff of Queens County and Marinus&#x27; grandfather. This claim has been refuted by E. Haviland Hillman in an article published in &quot;The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record&quot;, Volume 47 at 119, published in April 1916.

The descendants of Thomas Willett were numerous. The &#x27;Dorothy Q.&#x27; of the poem of Oliver Wendell Holmes was Thomas Willett&#x27;s great-granddaughter, and the great-grandmother of Holmes. Another of Thomas Willett&#x27;s descendants is American musician Parthenon Willett Miller Huxley. 

The Fire Department of New York operated a fireboat named &quot;Thomas Willett&quot; from 1908 to 1959.

<text>Fell running, also sometimes known as hill running, is the sport of running and racing, off-road, over upland country where the gradient climbed is a significant component of the difficulty. The name arises from the origins of the English sport on the fells of northern Britain, especially those in the Lake District. It has elements of trail running, cross country and mountain running, but is also distinct from those disciplines.

Fell races are organised on the premise that contenders possess mountain navigation skills and carry adequate survival equipment as prescribed by the organiser.

Fell running has common characteristics with cross-country running, but is distinguished by steeper gradients and upland country. It is sometimes considered a form of mountain running, but without the smoother trails and predetermined routes often associated with mountain running.

==History==
The first recorded hill race took place in Scotland. King Malcolm Canmore organised a race in Braemar in 1040 or perhaps as late as 1064, reputedly to find a swift messenger. This event appears to have been a precursor to the Braemar Gathering. There is no documented connection between this event and the fell races of the 19th century.

From the 19th century records survive of fell races taking place as a part of community fairs and games. The sport was a simple affair and was based upon each community&#x27;s values for physical ability. Fell races took place alongside other sports such as wrestling, sprint races and (especially in Scotland) heavy events such as throwing the hammer. These fairs or games events were often commercial as well as cultural, with livestock shows and sales taking place alongside music, dancing and sports. In a community of shepherds and agricultural labourers comparisons of speed and strength were interesting to spectators as a source of professional pride for competitors. The most famous of these events in England, the Grasmere Sports meeting in the Lake District, with its &quot;Guide&#x27;s Race&quot;, takes place every year in August.

The Fell Runners Association started in April 1970 to organise the duplication of event calendars for the amateur sport. As of 2013 it administers amateur fell running in England, in affiliation with British athletics. Separate governing bodies exist for each country of the United Kingdom and each country has its own tradition of fell running, though the sport is largely the same. The most important races of the year include the Ben Nevis Race in Scotland, run regularly since 1937, and the Snowdon Race in Wales.

==Overlap with other sports==
Fell running is often known as hill running, particularly in Scotland. It is sometimes called mountain running, as in the name of the Northern Ireland Mountain Running Association although the term mountain running often has connotations of WMRA races which tend to be on smoother, drier trails and lack the route choice which may be available in fell races.

Fell race courses are often longer than cross-country running courses, steeper and unmarked when out on the hills (with a few exceptions). Fell running also overlaps with orienteering. Courses are again typically longer but with less emphasis on navigation. Fell running does sometimes require navigational skills in a mountainous environment, particularly in determining and choosing between routes, and poor weather may increase the need for navigation. However, in most fell races, the route or sequence of checkpoints is published beforehand and runners may reconnoitre the course to reduce the risk of losing time working out where to run during the race. Category O events and Mountain Marathons (see also below), test navigational ability, attracting both orienteers and fell runners. Other multi-terrain events, such as the Cotswold Way Relay and the Long Mynd Hike, also qualify as fell races under Fell Runners Association rules.

Some fell running could also be classed as trail running. Trail running normally takes place on good paths or tracks which are relatively easy to follow and does not necessarily involve the significant amounts of ascent that are required in fell running.

==Rocks==
Fell running does not involve rock climbing and routes are subject to change if ground nearby becomes unstable. A small number of fell runners who are also rock climbers, nevertheless do attempt records traversing ridges that allow running and involve scrambling and rock climbing – particularly where the record is 24 hours or less. Foremost of these in the UK is probably the traverse of the Cuillin Main Ridge on Skye, the Greater Traverse, including Blaven and the Lakes Classic Rock Round.

==Organisations==
The Fell Runners Association (FRA) publishes a calendar of 400 to 500 races per year. Additional races, less publicised, are organised in UK regions. The British Open Fell Runners Association (BOFRA) publishes a smaller calendar of races (usually 15 championship races, and other smaller events, such as galas or shows)&gt;– mostly derived from the professional guide races – in England and Scotland and organises a championship series. In Scotland, all known hill races (both professional and amateur) are listed in the annual calendar of Scottish Hill Runners. In Wales, the Welsh Fell Runners Association provides a similar service. Northern Ireland events are organised by Northern Ireland Mountain Running Association. Again, races are run on the premise that a contender possesses mountain navigational skills and carries adequate survival equipment. In Ireland, events are organised by the Irish Mountain Running Association.

The World Mountain Running Association is the governing body for mountain running and as such is sanctioned by and affiliated with the IAAF, the International Association of Athletics Federations. It organises the World Mountain Running Championships. There are also continental championships, such as the African Mountain Running Championships, the European Mountain Running Championships, the South American Mountain Running Championships and the North American Central American and Caribbean Mountain Running Championships.

==Championships==

The first British Fell Running Championships, then known as Fell Runner of the Year, were held in 1972 and the scoring was based on results in all fell races. In 1976 this was changed to the runner&#x27;s best ten category A races and further changes took place to the format in later years. Starting with the 1986 season, an English Fell Running Championships series has also taken place, based on results in various races of different lengths over the year.

==Race categories==
Race records vary from a few minutes to, generally, a few hours. The longest common fell running challenges tend to be rounds to be completed within 24 hours, such as the Bob Graham Round. Some of the mountain marathons do call for pairs of runners to carry equipment and food for camping overnight. Longer possible routes do exist, such as an attempt at a continuous round of Munros. Mountaineers who traverse light and fast over high Alpine, Himalayan or through other such continental, high altitudes are considered alpine-style mountaineers by fell runners.

Races run under the FRA Rules For Competition of the Fell Runners Association are categorised by the amount of ascent and distance.

===Ascent categories===
====Category A====
*Should average not less than 50 metres climb per kilometre.
*Should be at least 1.5 kilometres in length.
*Should not have more than 20% of the race distance on road.

====Category B====
*Should average not less than 25 metres climb per kilometre.
*Should not have more than 30% of the race distance on road.

====Category C====
*Should average not less than 20 metres climb per kilometre.
*Should contain some genuine fell terrain.
*Should not have more than 40% of the race distance on road.

===Distance Categories===
====Category L====
*A category &quot;L&quot; (long) race is 20 kilometres or over.

====Category M====
*A category &quot;M&quot; (medium) race is over 10 kilometres but less than 20 kilometres.

====Category S====
*A category &quot;S&quot; (short) race is 10 kilometres or less.

===Additional categories===
====Category O====
*also known as a Long O event
*checkpoints are revealed to each competitor when they come up to a &quot;staggered&quot; start
*entry by choosing an orienteering type class, such as a Score-O event and often as a team of two (pairs)

====Category MM====
*events also known as mountain marathons and mountain trials
*similar to Category O, but multi-day events, in wild, mountainous country. Competitors must carry all the equipment and food required for the overnight camp and subsequent days. Entry is usually as a pair.

===Three example &quot;classic A&quot; races===
*&quot;Ben Nevis Race&quot; AM 10 miles (16 km) 4,400 ft (1340 m) - male record 1:25:34 (Kenny Stuart, 1984), female record 1:43:01 (Victoria Wilkinson, 2018)
*&quot;Blisco Dash&quot; AS 5 miles (8.1 km) 2,000 ft (610 m) - male record 36:01 (Jack Maitland, 1987), female record 44:34 (Hannah Horsburgh, 2018)
*&quot;Wasdale Fell Race&quot; AL 21 miles (34 km) 9,000 ft (2750 m) - male record 3:25:21 (Billy Bland, 1982), female record 4:12:17 (Janet McIver and Jackie Lee, 2008)

==Footwear==
Modern fell-running trainers use light, non-waterproof material to eject water and dislodge peat after traversing boggy ground. While the trainer needs to be supple, to grip an uneven, slippery surface, a degree of side protection against rock and scree (loose stones) may be provided. Rubber studs have been the mode for two decades, preceded by ripple soles, spikes and the flat-soled &quot;pumps&quot; of the fifties.

==24-hour challenges==
Fell runners have set many of the peak bagging records in the UK. In 1932 the Lakeland runner Bob Graham set a record of 42 Lakeland peaks in 24 hours. His feat, now known as the Bob Graham Round, was not repeated for many years (in 1960); by 2011, however, it had become a fell runner&#x27;s test-piece, and had been repeated by more than 1,610 people. Building on the basic &#x27;Round&#x27; later runners such as Eric Beard (56 tops in 1963) and Joss Naylor (72 tops in 1975) have raised the 24-hour Lakeland record considerably. The present record is 78 peaks, set by Kim Collison, on 11–12 July 2020; the previous record of 77 peaks, set by Mark Hartell, had stood since 1997. The women&#x27;s record of 68 peaks was set in 2022 by Fiona Pascall.

Most fell-running regions have their own challenges or &quot;rounds&quot;:
*Ireland – The Wicklow Round
*Lake District – The Bob Graham Round
*North Wales – The Paddy Buckley Round
*Northern Ireland – The Denis Rankin Round
*Scotland – The Ramsay Round
*South Wales – South Wales Traverse

<text>Ettore Cunial (November 16, 1905 – October 6, 2005) was an Italian prelate.

Born at Possagno in the Province of Treviso, Cunial was ordained priest in 1929. In 1953, his appointment as Titular Archbishop of Soteropolis and Vicegerent of Rome followed. He was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Roman Catholic Church by Pope Paul VI in 1976, and did not retire until October 23, 2004, even though the customary retirement age for the Roman Curia is 75, and very few are permitted by exception to remain in office past 80.

In February 2005 the death of Corrado Bafile left Cunial the oldest Catholic bishop in the world. Cunial died on October 6, 2005 at Possagno just six weeks before he would have turned 100.

<text>Benjamin Logan (May 1, 1743 – December 11, 1802) was an American pioneer, soldier, and politician from Virginia, then Shelby County, Kentucky. As colonel of the Kentucky County, Virginia militia during the American Revolutionary War, he was second-in-command of all the trans-Appalachian Virginia. He became a politician and help secure statehood for Kentucky. His brother, John Logan, who at times served under him in the militia and replaced him as delegate, became the first state treasurer of Kentucky.

==Early and family life==
Benjamin Logan was born in then-vast Augusta County, Virginia, the eldest son of Scottish immigrants David and Jane (McKinley) Logan. He had seven siblings by the time his father died, when Benjamin Logan was 15. By primogeniture, Benjamin inherited the family&#x27;s 860 acre (3.5 km2) farm, but would sell it when he reached legal age, then split the proceeds with his siblings and move across the Appalachian Mountains to the Holston River, where he purchased land and began to farm. He married Ann Montgomery in 1772; they had eight children.

==Militia Officer==
Logan served in the Virginia militia during Henry Bouquet&#x27;s 1764 campaign against the Shawnee. A decade later, he served as a lieutenant in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War against the same Indian nation. In 1775, Logan joined a party of settlers led by Daniel Boone who traveled to Kentucky, then the westernmost portion of Virginia. He left the group in what would become Lincoln County. With the help of his brother John and others, he built a stockade known as Logan&#x27;s Fort which eventually would grow into the town of St. Asaph&#x27;s near Stanford. In 1776, Logan brought his family from Virginia to join him, but initially settled them at Harrod&#x27;s Fort, as less exposed to Native raids, but in 1777 they joined him at Logan&#x27;s Fort. However, beginning on May 20, 1777, the fort was besieged by a hundred native warriors. When the garrison&#x27;s provisions and ammunition ran low, Logan and two companions left during the night and traveled 150 miles to the Holston settlement. Logan returned as fast as he could with powder and lead; his companions followed with a relief party under Col. John Bowman, which caused the besiegers to scatter.
Logan was appointed sheriff of the county and a justice of the peace. During the American Revolution, he was the second ranking officer in the Virginia militia for Kentucky County, taking part in the defense of the settlements against attacks made by British-led Indians. In July 1779, under Co. Bowman, Logan as second-in-command led 300 men in an expedition across the Ohio River to the native settlement at Chillicothe. He also joined in campaigns against hostile Indians north of the Ohio River, serving under George Rogers Clark. However, Logan and Clark frequently disagreed over strategy.

After American independence, Logan became active in the campaign to establish Kentucky as a separate state. He served as Kentucky&#x27;s representative in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1781 until 1787 when he began arguing for statehood.

In October 1786, Logan led a force of Kentucky mounted militiamen against the Shawnee towns in the Ohio Country along the Little Miami River and Mad River (Logan&#x27;s Raid). These were lightly defended since most warriors had left to defend the villages of Chief Little Turtle from a separate force moving up the Wabash River under the command of General George Rogers Clark. Logan seized and burned thirteen villages, taking prisoner women and children, destroying the food supplies and killing or capturing many, including the aged Chief Moluntha who surrendered under a U.S. flag outside his wegiwa while displaying the Shawnee copy of the Treaty of Fort Finney (1785). Despite the protection of Logan&#x27;s men, Captain Hugh McGary slipped through the guard and murdered the Shawnee chief. The chief&#x27;s death infuriated the Shawnee, who retaliated by redoubling their attacks against the whites, and escalating the Northwest Indian War.

Logan served as one of Lincoln County&#x27;s initial representatives to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1781, and also served in the 1785, 1786, and 1787 sessions. Meanwhile, Virginia conducted a tax census, which listed both John and Benjamin as non-residents of Lincoln County, but taxed each for slaves and livestock in the county, John for three enslaved adults and two younger slaves, as well as seven horses, a stud horse, and 30 cattle, and Benjamin for three adult slaves, five younger slaves, eight horses and 70 cattle. Since Benjamin Logan does not appear as a resident of another county, he may have been overlooked or away conducting a military expedition.

Benjamin Logan advocated for Kentucky statehood at the Danville Convention and was a delegate when it wrote the first Kentucky constitution in 1791 and 1792. Following statehood, he served in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1792 to 1795. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1795 and 1800, and for the U.S. Senate in 1798. In his 1795 campaign for governor, Logan won the first round of balloting but lost on the second to James Garrard.

==Death and legacy==
In 1802, Benjamin Logan died of a stroke at age 60, at his home 6 miles southwest of Shelbyville, Kentucky. He was buried in the family cemetery.

Both Logan County, Kentucky and Logan County, Ohio were named for him, as is the Benjamin Logan Local School District in Ohio.

He was the uncle of U.S. Supreme Court associate justice John McKinley.

<doc id="1095431" wikidata="Q6674400" url="?curid=1095431" title="Longueville, New South Wales">
<text>Longueville is a harbourside suburb on the Lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, 8 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Municipality of Lane Cove.

Longueville sits on the peninsula between Tambourine Bay and Woodford Bay, on the banks of the Lane Cove River. Originally a home to manufacturing industries, the suburb had its beginnings as a residential area in the 1870s. Longueville was officially proclaimed a suburb in the 1920s.

Before settlement, Longueville was the home of the Cammeraygal people of the Ku-ring-gai Aboriginal Tribe. The suburb has high house prices, in the top ten suburbs in Australia, with an average price of $5,412,500 as of May 2024.

==History==

The area in which Longueville is was originally inhabited by the Cammeraygal Group of the Ku-ring-gai Aboriginal Tribe. The group, which inhabited the north shore of Port Jackson, was one of the largest in the Sydney area.

In 1831, the area that is now Longueville became home to one of the earliest manufacturing industries, with Rupert Kirk&#x27;s soap and factory. Longueville had its beginnings in the 1870s, and at the time encompassed the Lane Cove area, which in turn was then part of Willoughby. By 1884, there were just two houses in the area, owned by Joseph Palmer and Henry Lamb. Richard Hayes Harnett, a land speculator, later acquired some of the land and subdivided it into home sites. He later became the first mayor of Mosman.

There is some conjecture about where the name Longueville originated, however a commonly held belief is that the suburb was named after French nobleman, the Duc de Longueville. The main streets are said to have been named after his three daughters, Christina, Lucretia and Arabella. A related theory is that the name bears a connection to the Château de Châteaudun which possesses both a &quot;Longueville&quot; wing and a &quot;Dunois&quot; wing, with &quot;Dunois&quot; being the name of one of the principal streets in Longueville.

==Transport==
Longueville wharf is served by Captain Cook Cruises ferry services. Busways route 261 operates to Lane Cove and King Street Wharf.

==Houses==

In 2011, the majority of dwellings were detached houses (99.1%) with some varied architectural styles, including stately Victorian-style homes, Federation styles, Californian bungalows, weatherboard cottages, and contemporary waterfront houses.

Longueville has some of Sydney’s highest property prices with a median property price of $5.41 million as of May 2024 according to allhomes.com.au, having climbed from the eighth most expensive at $2.23 million in 2011, positioning it as one of Sydney&#x27;s most prestigious suburbs. In the past few years, the suburb has seen many new homes being constructed and older houses undergoing extensive renovations.
Norfolk Road holds the record for the highest sale price achieved at auction in the suburb.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census, the population of Longueville stood at 2,116 people, 50.7% identified as female and 49.3% identified as male, with a median age of 46 years. 11.9% of the population was born overseas with England (4.8%), China (excluding SARs and Taiwan) (2.2%), New Zealand (1.8%), Hong Kong (SAR of China) (1.7%) and Malaysia (1.4%) being the most common countries of birth identified. The five strongest religious affiliations in the area were in descending order: Catholic (37.8%), No Religion, so described (28.9%), Anglican (14.2%), Eastern Orthodox (3.7%) and 2.6% of respondents elected not to disclose their religion.

Longueville&#x27;s population is notably affluent, with a median weekly household income of , compared with $1,746 in Australia. The most common types of occupation for employed persons were Professionals (43.5%), Managers (25.0%), Clerical and Administrative Workers (11.7%), Community and Personal Service Workers (5.8%), Sales Workers (5.7%), Technicians and Trades Workers (3.7%), Labourers (2.4%) and Machinery Operators and Drivers (0.3%). 89.8% of the suburbs occupied private dwellings were family households, 9.5% were lone person households and 0.8% were group households. 98.8% of private dwellings in the Longueville area were separate houses and 1.7% were flats or apartments.

== Politics ==
Longueville is in the formerly safe Liberal federal electoral division of North Sydney, electing an independent MP in 2022. Former Liberal Party Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey represented the seat from 1996 and was replaced by Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman at the 2015 North Sydney by-election. Zimmerman was the first openly gay man to be elected to the House of Representatives and was re-elected at the 2016 federal election. North Sydney is one of only two original divisions in New South Wales, along with Wentworth, which have never been held by the Australian Labor Party. In 2022 Kylea Tink was elected as part of a wave of &#x27;teal&#x27; independents that were elected in that year&#x27;s federal election, unseating many Liberal MPs. An independent won in the division of North Sydney despite losing this Longueville polling place in both the first-preference and two-candidate preferred vote.

For NSW state elections, Longueville is in the Electoral district of Lane Cove. Since 2003, this seat has been held by Liberal MP Anthony Roberts, a former minister in the state government.

<text>Sir Ralph Winwood (c. 1563 – 27 October 1617) was an English diplomat and statesman to the Jacobean court.

==Early life==
Ralph Winwood was born the son of Richard Winwood at Aynhoe in Northamptonshire. A &#x27;hot puritan&#x27;, according to a Jesuit reporter, he was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford (1577), Magdalen College, Oxford (1582). To conclude his education, he travelled to Italy, where he enrolled at the University of Padua (1594). 

==Career==
Pursuing a career as a diplomat, Winwood became secretary to Sir Henry Neville (c. 1562-1615), the English ambassador in France, in 1599 and he succeeded Neville in this position two years later, retaining it until 1603. He was Clerk of Privy Council (extraordinary) from 1603 to 1608, and (ordinary) from 1608 to 1609. In 1603 Winwood was sent to The Hague as agent to the States-General of the United Provinces, and was appointed a member of the Dutch council of state on the basis of the Treaty of Nonsuch. Winwood&#x27;s hearty dislike of Spain coloured all his actions in Holland; he was anxious to see a continuance of the war between Spain and the United Netherlands, and expressed both his own views and those of the English government at the time when he wrote, &quot;how convenient this war would be for the good of His Majesty&#x27;s realms, if it might be maintained without his charge.&quot; He was knighted on 28 June 1607.

In June 1608, Winwood signed the league between England and the United Provinces. Shortly afterwards, he became the first accredited English ambassador to the Dutch Republic. He was in Holland when the trouble over the succession to the duchies of Jülich and Cleves threatened to cause a European war. In this matter, he negotiated with the Protestant Princes of Germany on behalf of King James I of England. As ambassador, Winwood publicly intervened in the Vorstius affair, and secretly sided with the Contra-Remonstrants in the religious conflicts that engulfed the United Provinces during and after his embassy. While in Holland he obtained greyhounds for Anne of Denmark from Jacob van den Eynde, Governor of Woerden. He was appointed Master of Requests from 1609 to 1614.
Having returned to England Sir Ralph became secretary of state and Privy Councillor from 1614 until his death and a Member of Parliament (MP) for Buckingham. 

In the House of Commons he defended the king&#x27;s right to levy impositions. Created principal Secretary of state on Somerset&#x27;s demise, Winwood held the office from March 1614 to his death during the Addled Parliament. Winwood was responsible for the inquiry into the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury and the release of Raleigh from the Tower in 1616. Raleigh was urged by Winwood to attack the Spanish fleet and the Spanish settlements in South America. 

Spanish envoys at Court of St James&#x27;s made several written complaints about the secretary&#x27;s share in this undertaking to the king at Whitehall Palace. In the midst of this latest foreign policy crisis, Sir Ralph Winwood died in London on 28 October 1617. It can hardly be doubted, wrote Gardiner, that, if he had lived till the following summer, he would have shared in Raleigh&#x27;s ruin.

==Marriage==
Ralph Winwood married Elizabeth Ball, daughter of Nicholas Ball of Totnes, Devon, by whom he had five sons (2 of whom predeceased him) and four daughters. One of Winwood&#x27;s daughters, Anne Winwood (d. 1643), married Edward Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Boughton, and their son was Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu.

==Ditton House==
Winwood acquired the park and manor of Ditton at Stoke Poges. John Chamberlain described improvements at Ditton Park in August 1617 made by Winwood and his wife, including a new dovecote, a spring and conduit, fair ponds, damming and filling in the old moat, planting an orchard, and setting out a walled garden with arbours.

<doc id="1095440" wikidata="Q124097" url="?curid=1095440" title="Karl Ernst Krafft">
<text>Karl Ernst Krafft (10 May 1900 – 8 January 1945) was a Swiss astrologer, born in Basel. He worked on the fields of astrology and graphology.

==Astrology career==
After studying in the University of Basel and Geneva, he graduated with a degree in mathematics. For the best part of ten years he worked on a massive book entitled &quot;Traits of Astro-Biology&quot;. This expounded his own theory of &quot;Typocosmy&quot;: the prediction of the future based on the study of an individual&#x27;s personality, or type. Krafft opened an office in Zürich, where he provided horoscopes and investment advice. Krafft&#x27;s business collapsed, as did and his own investments (which were decided via divination).

By the early 1930s, when Adolf Hitler had come to power, Krafft enjoyed a unique status among occultists and prophets in Germany. The National Socialists, later to become his patrons, at first posed a threat to him. Occultists, like Freemasons, were among those harassed and vilified by most National Socialists. While the Nazi state persecuted astrologers, Rudolf Hess and Heinrich Himmler consulted them. Krafft moved to Germany at the invitation of the Nazis and was endorsed by the Ministry of Propaganda. Kraff subsequently joined the Nazi Party and introduced anti-Semitic ideas into his work. Krafft moved into the orbit of the National Socialist elite in November 1939 when he made a remarkable prediction. He predicted that the Führer&#x27;s life would be in danger between 7 and 10 November. He wrote, on 2 November to a friend, Dr Heinrich Fesel, who worked for Himmler, warning him of an attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life. Fesel filed the letter away, unwillingly to become enmeshed in something dangerous. 

On 8 November, a bomb exploded at the Munich beer hall. There were many injuries but the target, Hitler, was unscathed because he left the assembly in the hall a few minutes before the explosion. When newspapers reported the near-catastrophe Fesel dispatched a telegram to Hess, drawing attention to Krafft&#x27;s prediction. Krafft was arrested and brought to Gestapo Headquarters in Berlin. Krafft&#x27;s proclamation of exacting astrological rules managed to convince the Gestapo that astrology enabled its practitioners to make accurate forecasts of future events resulting in now being employed by the Nazi Propaganda Ministry, the SS and even the Foreign Office to carry out astrological studies of a political nature. After his release he was summoned to the Reich Propaganda ministry, run by Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels had recently taken to poring over Nostradamus, trying to squeeze propaganda from the prophecies. Krafft, he felt, should work on deciphering the cryptic quatrains. Krafft began work on a pro-German evaluation of Nostradamus.

Krafft was convinced that the prophecies of Nostradamus boded well for the Third Reich. Tens of thousands of pamphlets based upon his interpretations of the quatrains were translated and circulated in six languages: French (translated by Krafft himself), Danish, Hungarian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish and he soon came to the attention of the Führer. In the spring of 1940 he gave a private horoscope reading for Hitler to an aide, but he never met his leader.

British intelligence became so concerned at the thought that their opponent&#x27;s war was being conducted by a mystic that they, for a time, hired the services of astrologer Louis De Wohl. De Wohl was quietly dropped after several months, having failed to procure any hard evidence about Krafft&#x27;s work.

Krafft warned the Reich leaders that for victory to be certain, the war must end for Germany in 1943. Krafft&#x27;s star was still in the ascendancy when Rudolf Hess made his astonishing flight to Scotland in 1941. Hitler was outraged. Hess was the biggest occult supporter of them all. Hitler ordered a purge of astrologers, occultists and other sages. Krafft was caught up in this. He worked on horoscopes of Allied generals and admirals, having informal contacts with Kurd Kisshauer and Amt Rosenberg. One of his predictions when seeing the charts of both Erwin Rommel and Bernard Montgomery, adversaries in the desert war, was: &quot;Well this man Montgomery&#x27;s chart is certainly stronger than Rommel&#x27;s.&quot;

==Later life==
Krafft was arrested on 12 June 1941, as part of a crackdown on astrologers, faith healers and occultists following Rudolf Hess&#x27;s flight to Scotland. He was released in 1943 and set back to propaganda work, but the integrity of his forecasts soon told against him. Krafft&#x27;s bitter complaints at the demeaning work he was expected to do, led to his rearrest in 1944. He was held in poor conditions, caught typhus fever and eventually died on 8 January 1945 en route to the Buchenwald concentration camp.

<text>West Kameng (pronounced ) is a district of Arunachal Pradesh in northeastern India. It accounts for 8.86% of the total area of the state. The name is derived from the Kameng river, a tributary of the Brahmaputra, that flows through the district.

== History ==

The area around the Kameng river has traditionally come under the control of the Mon kingdom, Bhutan, Tibet and the Ahom kingdom. Tibetan Buddhism got a strong foothold among the tribal groups as early as in the 7th century, where the Kachen Lama constructed the Lhagyala Gompa in Morshing.

Whenever loose control was exerted over the area, small, feudal chiefdoms ruled by the Miji and the Aka chiefs dominated control over the area. This can be evidenced in the fact that ruined fortresses like those in Bhalukpong constructed in the 10th to 12th century and the Dirang fort, which was constructed in the 17th century to defend against invasions from neighbouring chiefdoms.

Upon the arrival of the British, the present-day West Kameng was placed under what was known as the North-East Frontier Agency (later, Arunachal Pradesh). It was renamed as the Balipara Frontier tract in 1919, with its headquarters at Charduar in Assam. In 1946, the district area was carved out of the Balipara, with the name Sela Sub-Agency and its headquarters continued to be Charduar of Assam.

Following the independence of India, the Sela Sub-Agency was renamed as the Kameng Frontier Division. Its headquarters were later transferred to Bomdila in 1954. However, with the invasion of Tibet in 1950, Tibetan refugees started populating the area. Furthermore, with the invasion of the Chinese troops into this area, many historical monuments were either destroyed or defaced.

The Kameng Frontier Division was renamed as the &quot;Kameng District&quot;. The &quot;Political Officer&quot; was also redesignated as the &quot;Deputy Commissioner of Kameng&quot;. However, due to political reasons, the Kameng district was bifurcated between East Kameng and West Kameng on 1 June 1980. Tawang district, which initially belonged to part of the district, was separated on 6 October 1984.
In 2023, Bichom district was carved out from West Kameng district. It comprises all the regions inhabited by the Miji community

<text>Peregrine Bertie, 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven (29 April 16861 January 1742), styled The Honourable Peregrine Bertie between 1686 and 1704, Lord Willoughby de Eresby between 1704 and 1715 and Marquess of Lindsey between 1715 and 1723, was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1708 until 1715 when he was called to the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Bertie was the second and eldest surviving son of Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby (subsequently 4th Earl of Lindsey) and his first wife Mary Wynn, daughter of Sir Richard Wynn, 4th Baronet. He became Lord Willoughby and heir to other titles on the death of his elder brother in 1704.

==Career==
At the 1708 British general election Lord Willoughby was returned as a Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire with his father&#x27;s support. Although his father was a Whig, Willoughby acted as a Tory. He sat on a drafting committee for the Boston church bill, and a committee of inquiry into the laws excluding . He acted against the Whigs in an electoral dispute. Although nominated to the committee examining the arrangements for the trial of Dr Sacheverell, he voted against the impeachment in 1710. He was returned as a Tory at the 1710 election and listed as one of the &#x27;worthy patriots&#x27; who detected the mismanagements of the previous administration, and a &#x27;Tory patriot&#x27; who opposed the continuation of the war in 1711. He was also a member of the October Club. He sat on drafting committees for bills to build a waterworks near Boston and to help drain the Ancholme Level. As a Hanoverian Tory, he voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele in March 1714. He did not stand at the 1715 general election but was summoned to the House of Lords by a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s Barony of Willoughby de Eresby on 16 March 1715.

He was a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to George I from 1719 to 1727. In 1723, on the death of his father, he inherited the rest of the family titles, and the hereditary Great Office of Lord Great Chamberlain. He also inherited the Lincolnshire seats at Grimsthorpe Castle and Eresby, and the London mansion, Lindsey House, at 59-60 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire in succession to his father in 1724. He was receiver of the Duchy of Lancaster rents in Lincolnshire from 1728 to his death, and Lord Warden and Chief Justice in Eyre north of the Trent from 1734 to his death. He had a seat on the Foundling Hospital&#x27;s board of governors when the charity was founded in 1739.

<text>is a Japanese film series starring Kiyoshi Atsumi as Torajirō Kuruma, whose nickname is , a kind-hearted vagabond who is always unlucky in love. The series itself is often referred to as &quot;Tora-san&quot; by its fans. Spanning 48 installments released between 1969 and 1995, all of the &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot; films except episodes 3 (Azuma Morisaki) and 4 () were directed by Yōji Yamada, who also wrote (or co-wrote) all the screenplays.

Each film featured a different leading lady, called a Madonna, and a different region of Japan. (There were also episodes that featured scenes in Arizona and Vienna.) Two films were usually made each year between 1969 and 1989, one for summer and one for New Year release. From 1990 to 1995 only one film was made each year, for New Year release. AnimEigo released a box-set of the first four films in the United States in 2009 under the title &quot;Tora-san&quot;. The series holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running movie series starring a single actor.

The film series had presumed to have ended with Atsumi&#x27;s declining health and death from lung cancer at age 68, without Tora-san ever settling down and finding domestic happiness. Atsumi was so identified with the Tora-san character that his death was also considered by fans to be the death of Tora-san. Director Yamada had decided at the time not to continue the series after Atsumi&#x27;s death, but reworked a Tora-san script stuck in development as &quot;Niji wo Tsukamu Otoko&quot; starring Nishida Toshiyuki as a traveling cinema operator. Although &quot;Niji&quot; was a tribute to movies in general, the final scenes were Yamada&#x27;s touching, loving posthumous tribute to the Tora-san series and to Atsumi Kiyoshi. Almost all of the principal actors from &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot; have cameos in the &quot;Niji&quot; film, and the Tora-san character even makes a surprise cameo appearance near the end of the movie. The film ends with a dedication to Atsumi Kiyoshi.

However, the 50th Tora-san film, &quot;Tora-san, Wish You Were Here&quot;, was released in Japan on December 27, 2019. Atsumi appears throughout the film as flashbacks, using footage from his dozens of performances as Tora-san in the previous films, with the cast members in contemporary Tokyo recalling his presence in their lives.

==Basic plot==
Torajirō Kuruma (Tora-san) is a traveling salesman whose sole possessions are the contents of a small suitcase, the clothes on his back and some pocket money. He wanders from town to town peddling his wares. He yearns to return to his home in Shibamata, Katsushika, Tokyo.

His family members include Sakura (his kind-hearted half-sister), Hiroshi (Sakura&#x27;s husband), Mitsuo (Sakura and Hiroshi&#x27;s son), Tatsuzō (Tora-san&#x27;s elderly uncle), and Tsune (Tora-san&#x27;s elderly aunt). Tatsuzō and Tsune run a traditional sweet (dango) shop in Shibamata. The film often begins with Tora-san dreaming of doing grand deeds, anxious to be worthy of his family, usually resulting in disappointment and subsequent awakening.

Tora-san unexpectedly drops in on his family. While they are glad to see him, Tora-san&#x27;s stay eventually causes some kind of ruckus and usually a violent family argument ensues. He then storms off with his belongings just as suddenly as he arrived.

In each film he falls in love with a &quot;Madonna,&quot; an attractive woman, but he invariably ends up heartbroken.

==Origin of the series==
Preceding the first theatrical film of &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot;, a teledrama version was broadcast from 1968 to 1969. It was originally titled &quot;Gukei (or &quot;Gukyō&quot;)-Kenmai&quot; (愚兄賢妹), meaning &quot;Goofy Brother and Wise Sister.&quot; The name comes from the final subtitle of &quot;Naite tamaruka&quot; (泣いてたまるか). (The star of &quot;Naite tamaruka&quot; is also Atsumi Kiyoshi.)

Kobayashi Shun&#x27;ichi renamed the show &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot;. In the final episode of the TV series, Torajirō dies of a snakebite. This denouement made the audience angry and a film version of &quot;Otoko wa Tsurai yo&quot; followed.

Initially, Shochiku, the distributing agency, was not enthusiastic about the film&#x27;s prospects but Yōji Yamada&#x27;s persuasiveness ultimately prevailed. The film series went on to become a huge success with films released every summer and New Years. The series became part of Japanese pop culture. With the exception of Morikawa Shin, the supporting cast of the television version did not reprise their roles in the film series – though Sato Gajiro appears in most of the films as &quot;Gen-chan,&quot; Nagayama Aiko is the Madonna in the 5th film and Hisashi Igawa is her suitor.

<doc id="1095456" wikidata="Q936496" url="?curid=1095456" title="Sable (heraldry)">
<text>In British heraldry, sable () is the tincture equivalent to black. It is one of the five dark tinctures called &quot;colours&quot;.

Sable is portrayed in heraldic hatching by criss-crossing perpendicular lines. Sable is indicated by the abbreviation s. or sa. when a coat of arms is tricked.

==Etymology==
Sable can be traced back to Middle English, Anglo-French, and ultimately to the Middle Low German &quot;sabel&quot;, which refers to a species of marten known as a sable. This is related to the Middle High German &quot;zobel&quot;, which is of Slav origin and akin to the Russian &quot;sobol&quot;&#x27;, which likewise refers to the sable. Since at least the 14th century, sable has been used as a synonym for the colour black.

Both &quot;sable&quot; and &quot;negro&quot; are used for black in Spanish heraldry. In Portugal, black is known as &quot;negro&quot;, and in Germany the colour is called &quot;schwarz&quot;. &quot;Sabel&quot; is the spelling used in Dutch heraldry.

==Poetic meanings==
The different tinctures are traditionally associated with particular heavenly bodies, precious stones, virtues, and flowers, although these associations have been mostly disregarded by serious heraldists. Sable is associated with:
* Of jewels, the diamond
* Of heavenly bodies, Saturn
* Of virtues, constancy or prudence
* Of flowers, the herb nightshade, in these circumstances also called dwal

==Sable in Central Europe==
Sable is considered a &quot;colour&quot; in British and French heraldry, and contrasts with lighter &quot;metals&quot;, argent and Or. However, in the heraldry of Germany, Poland and other parts of Central Europe, sable is not infrequently placed on colour fields. As a result, a sable cross may appear on a red shield, or a sable bird may appear on a blue or a red field, as in the arms of Albania.

In Hungary, for example, one can find examples of sable on gules and azure fields as early as the sixteenth century in the arms of the family Kanizsai (granted in 1519): &quot;Azure, an eagle&#x27;s wing sable taloned Or between a decrescent argent and a sun Or.&quot; Another early Hungarian example was granted in 1628 to the family Karomi Bornemisza: &quot;Per fess gules, an eagle displayed sable crowned Or, and azure, a buffalo&#x27;s head cabossed sable maintaining in its mouth a fish (argent?)&quot;.

Polish examples abound as early as the fifteenth century. Józef Szymański includes no fewer than seven examples of sable primary charges on either gules or azure fields out of the approximately 200 shields from this period whose blazons are known. These include the arms of Corvin, &quot;Azure, a raven sable with a circlet or in its beak&quot;; Kownaty, &quot;Gules, a trumpet sable with a cord or, a Passion cross of the same issuing from its opening&quot;; and Słońce, &quot;Gules, a sphere radiant sable, its centre argent&quot;. In addition to the seven major examples, he describes occasional variants for the arms of some rody which also use sable charges on azure or gules fields.

Sable charges on gules fields also appear in the armory used in Lithuania. This is not surprising, since a significant fraction of Lithuania&#x27;s personal coats of arms are of Polish origin, so there is a certain similarity of style. Among these coats are those of Great Žemaitija: &quot;a black bear with an argent chain on its neck on a field gules&quot;.

<doc id="1095457" wikidata="Q1475243" url="?curid=1095457" title="Battle of Cape Esperance">
<text>The Battle of Cape Esperance, also known as the Second Battle of Savo Island and in Japanese sources as the , took place on 11–12 October 1942, in the Pacific campaign of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and United States Navy. The naval battle was the second of four major surface engagements during the Guadalcanal campaign and took place at the entrance to the strait between Savo Island and Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Cape Esperance is the northernmost point on Guadalcanal, and the battle took its name from this point.

On the night of 11 October, Japanese naval forces in the Solomon Islands area—under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa—sent a major supply and reinforcement convoy to their forces on Guadalcanal. The convoy consisted of two seaplane tenders and six destroyers and was commanded by Rear Admiral Takatsugu Jojima. At the same time but in a separate operation, three heavy cruisers and two destroyers—under the command of Rear Admiral Aritomo Gotō—were to bombard the Allied airfield on Guadalcanal (called Henderson Field by the Allies) with the object of destroying Allied aircraft and the airfield&#x27;s facilities.

Shortly before midnight on 11 October, a U.S. force of four cruisers and five destroyers—under the command of Rear Admiral Norman Scott—intercepted Gotō&#x27;s force as it approached Savo Island near Guadalcanal. Taking the Japanese by surprise, Scott&#x27;s warships sank one of Gotō&#x27;s cruisers and one of his destroyers, heavily damaged another cruiser, mortally wounded Gotō, and forced the rest of Gotō&#x27;s warships to abandon the bombardment mission and retreat. During the exchange of gunfire, one of Scott&#x27;s destroyers was sunk, and one cruiser and another destroyer were heavily damaged. In the meantime, the Japanese supply convoy successfully completed unloading at Guadalcanal and began its return journey without being discovered by Scott&#x27;s force. Later on the morning of 12 October, four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to assist Gotō&#x27;s retreating, damaged warships. Air attacks by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field sank two of these destroyers later that day.

As with the preceding naval engagements around Guadalcanal and to be expected from a battle of relatively limited size, the strategic outcome was inconclusive because neither the Japanese nor United States navies secured operational control of the waters around Guadalcanal as a result of this action, and a heavy bombardment operation against Henderson Field would be conducted soon after, causing severe destruction in the three nights between 13 and 16 October. However, the Battle of Cape Esperance provided a significant morale boost to the U.S. Navy after its disastrous defeat at the Battle of Savo Island.

==Background==
On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The objective was to deny the islands to the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and secure starting points for a campaign to isolate the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The Guadalcanal campaign would last six months.

The 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese personnel on the islands were taken by complete surprise, and by nightfall on 8 August, the 11,000 Allied troops, under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift, secured Tulagi and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal, named &quot;Henderson Field&quot; by the Allies. Allied aircraft operating from Henderson were called the &quot;Cactus Air Force&quot; (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal.

In response, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s 17th Army—a corps-sized formation headquartered at Rabaul under Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake—with the task of retaking Guadalcanal. On 19 August, various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on the island.

The threat posed by Allied aircraft prevented the Japanese from using large, slow transport ships to deliver their troops and supplies to the island, so warships were used instead. These ships—mainly light cruisers and destroyers—were usually able to make the round trip down &quot;the Slot&quot; to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to air attacks. Delivering troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being delivered. In addition, they expended destroyers, which were desperately needed for commerce defense. These high-speed runs occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; by the Allies and &quot;Rat Transportation&quot; by the Japanese.
With their heavier concentration of surface combat vessels, their well-positioned logistical base at Simpson Harbor, Rabaul, and their victory at the Battle of Savo Island in early August, the Japanese had established operational control over the waters around Guadalcanal at night. However, any Japanese ship remaining within range—about —of American aircraft at Henderson Field during the daylight hours was in danger of damaging air attacks. This persisted for the months of August and September 1942. The presence of Admiral Norman Scott&#x27;s task force at Cape Esperance represented the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first major attempt to wrest night time operational control of waters around Guadalcanal away from the Japanese.

The first attempt by the Japanese Army to recapture Henderson Field was on 21 August, in the Battle of the Tenaru, and the next, the Battle of Edson&#x27;s Ridge, from 12–14 September; both failed. The Japanese set their next major attempt to recapture Henderson Field for 20 October and moved most of the 2nd and 38th infantry divisions, totalling 17,500 troops, from the Dutch East Indies to Rabaul in preparation for delivering them to Guadalcanal. From 14 September to 9 October, numerous Tokyo Express runs delivered troops from the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division as well as Hyakutake to Guadalcanal. In addition to cruisers and destroyers, some of these runs included the seaplane carrier , which delivered heavy equipment to the island including vehicles and heavy artillery other warships could not carry because of space limitations. The Japanese Navy promised to support the army&#x27;s planned offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and by stepping up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.

In the meantime, Major General Millard F. Harmon—commander of United States Army forces in the South Pacific—convinced Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley—overall commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific Area—that the Marines on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive. Thus, on 8 October, the 2,837 men of the 164th Infantry Regiment from the U.S. Army&#x27;s Americal Division boarded ships at New Caledonia for the trip to Guadalcanal with a projected arrival date of 13 October.
To protect the transports carrying the 164th to Guadalcanal, Ghormley ordered Task Force 64 (TF 64), consisting of four cruisers (, , , and ) and five destroyers (, , , , and ) under Scott, to intercept and combat any Japanese ships approaching Guadalcanal and threatening the convoy. Scott conducted one night battle practice with his ships on 8 October, then took station south of Guadalcanal near Rennell Island on 9 October, to await word of any Japanese naval movement toward the southern Solomons.

Continuing with preparations for the October offensive, Japanese Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa&#x27;s Eighth Fleet staff, headquartered at Rabaul, scheduled a large and important Tokyo Express supply run for the night of 11 October. &quot;Nisshin&quot; would be joined by the seaplane carrier to deliver 728 soldiers, four large howitzers, two field guns, one anti-aircraft gun, and a large assortment of ammunition and other equipment from the Japanese naval bases in the Shortland Islands and at Buin, Bougainville, to Guadalcanal. Six destroyers, five of them carrying troops, would accompany &quot;Nisshin&quot; and &quot;Chitose&quot;. The supply convoy—called the &quot;Reinforcement Group&quot; by the Japanese—was under the command of Rear Admiral Takatsugu Jojima. At the same time but in a separate operation, the three heavy cruisers of Cruiser Division 6 (CruDiv6)—, , and , all participants in the Battle of Savo Island, under the command of Rear Admiral Aritomo Gotō—were to bombard Henderson Field with special explosive shells with the object of destroying the CAF and the airfield&#x27;s facilities. Two screening destroyers— and —accompanied CruDiv6. Since U.S. Navy warships had yet to attempt to interdict any Tokyo Express missions to Guadalcanal, the Japanese were not expecting any opposition from U.S. naval surface forces that night.

==Battle==

===Prelude===

At 08:00, on 11 October, Jojima&#x27;s reinforcement group departed the Shortland Islands anchorage to begin their run down the Slot to Guadalcanal. The six destroyers that accompanied &quot;Nisshin&quot; and &quot;Chitose&quot; were , , , , , and . Gotō departed the Shortland Islands for Guadalcanal at 14:00 the same day.

To protect the reinforcement group&#x27;s approach to Guadalcanal from the CAF, the Japanese 11th Air Fleet, based at Rabaul, Kavieng, and Buin, planned two air strikes on Henderson Field for 11 October. A &quot;fighter sweep&quot; of 17 Mitsubishi A6M3 Zero fighters swept over Henderson Field just after mid-day but failed to engage any U.S. aircraft. Forty-five minutes later, the second wave—45 Mitsubishi G4M2 &quot;Betty&quot; bombers and 30 Zeros—arrived over Henderson Field. In an ensuing air battle with the CAF, one G4M and two U.S. fighters were downed. Although the Japanese attacks failed to inflict significant damage, they did prevent CAF bombers from finding and attacking the reinforcement group. As the reinforcement group transited the Slot, relays of 11th Air Fleet Zeros from Buin provided escort. Emphasizing the importance of this convoy for Japanese plans, the last flight of the day was ordered to remain on station over the convoy until darkness, then ditch their aircraft and await pickup by the reinforcement group&#x27;s destroyers. All six Zeros ditched; only one pilot was recovered.

Allied reconnaissance aircraft from Guadalcanal sighted Jojima&#x27;s supply convoy between Kolombangara and Choiseul in the Slot at 14:45 on the same day and reported it as two &quot;cruisers&quot; and six destroyers. Gotō&#x27;s force—following the convoy—was not sighted. In response to the sighting of Jojima&#x27;s force, at 16:07 Scott turned toward Guadalcanal for an interception.

Scott crafted a simple battle plan for the expected engagement. His ships would steam in column with his destroyers at the front and rear of his cruiser column, searching across a 300 degree arc with SG surface radar in an effort to gain positional advantage on the approaching enemy force. The destroyers were to illuminate any targets with searchlights and discharge torpedoes while the cruisers were to open fire at any available targets without awaiting orders. The cruiser&#x27;s float aircraft, launched in advance, were to find and illuminate the Japanese warships with flares. Although &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;Boise&quot; carried the new, greatly improved SG radar, Scott chose &quot;San Francisco&quot; as his flagship.

At 22:00, as Scott&#x27;s ships neared Cape Hunter at the northwest end of Guadalcanal, three of Scott&#x27;s cruisers launched floatplanes. One crashed on takeoff, but the other two patrolled over Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and Ironbottom Sound. As the floatplanes were launched, Jojima&#x27;s force was just passing around the mountainous northwestern shoulder of Guadalcanal, and neither force sighted each other. At 22:20, Jojima radioed Gotō and told him no U.S. ships were in the vicinity. Although Jojima&#x27;s force later heard Scott&#x27;s floatplanes overhead while unloading along the north shore of Guadalcanal, they failed to report this to Gotō.

At 22:33, just after passing Cape Esperance, Scott&#x27;s ships assumed battle formation. The column was led by &quot;Farenholt&quot;, &quot;Duncan&quot;, and &quot;Laffey&quot;, and followed by &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Boise&quot;, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, and &quot;Helena&quot;. &quot;Buchanan&quot; and &quot;McCalla&quot; brought up the rear. The distance between each ship ranged from . Visibility was poor because the moon had already set, leaving no ambient light and no visible sea horizon.

Gotō&#x27;s force passed through several rain squalls as they approached Guadalcanal at . Gotō&#x27;s flagship &quot;Aoba&quot; led the Japanese cruisers in column, followed by &quot;Furutaka&quot; and &quot;Kinugasa&quot;. &quot;Fubuki&quot; was starboard of &quot;Aoba&quot; and &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot; to port. At 23:30, Gotō&#x27;s ships emerged from the last rain squall and began appearing on the radar scopes of &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;. The Japanese, however, whose warships were not equipped with radar, remained unaware of Scott&#x27;s presence.

===Action===
At 23:00, the &quot;San Francisco&quot; aircraft spotted Jojima&#x27;s force off Guadalcanal and reported it to Scott. Scott, believing more Japanese ships were likely still on the way, continued his course towards the west side of Savo Island. At 23:33, Scott ordered his column to turn towards the southwest to a heading of 230°. All of Scott&#x27;s ships understood the order as a column movement except Scott&#x27;s own ship, &quot;San Francisco&quot;. As the three lead U.S. destroyers executed the column movement, &quot;San Francisco&quot; turned simultaneously. &quot;Boise&quot;—following immediately behind—followed &quot;San Francisco&quot;, thereby throwing the three van destroyers out of formation.

At 23:32, &quot;Helena&quot;″s radar showed the Japanese warships to be about away. At 23:35, &quot;Boise&quot;″s and &quot;Duncan&quot;″s radars also detected Gotō&#x27;s ships. Between 23:42 and 23:44, &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;Boise&quot; reported their contacts to Scott on &quot;San Francisco&quot; who mistakenly believed the two cruisers were actually tracking the three U.S. destroyers that were thrown out of formation during the column turn. Scott radioed &quot;Farenholt&quot; to ask if the destroyer was attempting to resume its station at the front of the column. &quot;Farenholt&quot; replied, &quot;Affirmative, coming up on your starboard side,&quot; further confirming Scott&#x27;s belief that the radar contacts were his own destroyers.

At 23:45, &quot;Farenholt&quot; and &quot;Laffey&quot;—still unaware of Gotō&#x27;s approaching warships—increased speed to resume their stations at the front of the U.S. column. &quot;Duncan&quot;″s crew, however, thinking that &quot;Farenholt&quot; and &quot;Laffey&quot; were commencing an attack on the Japanese warships, increased speed to launch a solitary torpedo attack on Gotō&#x27;s force without telling Scott what they were doing. &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s radar registered the Japanese ships, but Scott was not informed of the sighting. By 23:45, Gotō&#x27;s ships were only away from Scott&#x27;s formation and visible to &quot;Helena&quot;″s and &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;″s lookouts. The U.S. formation at this point was in position to cross the T of the Japanese formation, giving Scott&#x27;s ships a significant tactical advantage. At 23:46, still assuming that Scott was aware of the rapidly approaching Japanese warships, &quot;Helena&quot; radioed for permission to open fire, using the general procedure request, &quot;Interrogatory Roger&quot; (meaning, basically, &quot;Are we clear to act?&quot;). Scott answered with, &quot;Roger&quot;, meaning only that the message was received, not that he was confirming the request to act. Upon receipt of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Roger&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;—thinking they now had permission—opened fire, quickly followed by &quot;Boise&quot;, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, and to Scott&#x27;s further surprise, &quot;San Francisco&quot;.
Gotō&#x27;s force was taken almost completely by surprise. At 23:43, &quot;Aoba&quot;″s lookouts sighted Scott&#x27;s force, but Gotō assumed that they were Jojima&#x27;s ships. Two minutes later, &quot;Aoba&quot;″s lookouts identified the ships as American, but Gotō remained skeptical and directed his ships to flash identification signals. As &quot;Aoba&quot;″s crew executed Gotō&#x27;s order, the first American salvo smashed into &quot;Aoba&quot;″s superstructure. &quot;Aoba&quot; was quickly hit by up to 40 shells from &quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Farenholt&quot;, and &quot;Laffey&quot;. The shell hits heavily damaged &quot;Aoba&quot;″s communications systems and demolished two of her main gun turrets as well as her main gun director. Several large-caliber projectiles passed through &quot;Aoba&quot;″s flag bridge without exploding, but the force of their passage killed many men and mortally wounded Gotō.

Scott—still unsure who his ships were firing at and afraid they might be firing on his own destroyers—ordered a ceasefire at 23:47, although not every ship complied. Scott ordered &quot;Farenholt&quot; to flash her recognition signals, and upon observing that &quot;Farenholt&quot; was close to his formation he ordered the fire resumed at 23:51.

&quot;Aoba&quot;, continuing to receive damaging hits, turned to starboard to head away from Scott&#x27;s formation and began making a smoke screen which led most of the Americans to believe that she was sinking. Scott&#x27;s ships shifted their fire to &quot;Furutaka&quot;, which was following behind &quot;Aoba&quot;. At 23:49, &quot;Furutaka&quot; was hit in her torpedo tubes, igniting a large fire that attracted even more shellfire from the U.S. ships. At 23:58, a torpedo from &quot;Buchanan&quot; hit &quot;Furutaka&quot; in her forward engine room, causing severe damage. During this time, &quot;San Francisco&quot; and &quot;Boise&quot; sighted &quot;Fubuki&quot; about away and raked her with shellfire, joined soon by most of the rest of Scott&#x27;s formation. Heavily damaged, &quot;Fubuki&quot; began to sink. &quot;Kinugasa&quot; and &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot; chose to turn to port rather than to starboard and so escaped the Americans&#x27; immediate attention.

During the exchange of gunfire, &quot;Farenholt&quot; received several damaging hits from both the Japanese and the American ships, killing several men. She escaped from the crossfire by crossing ahead of &quot;San Francisco&quot; and passing to the disengaged side of Scott&#x27;s column. &quot;Duncan&quot;—still engaged in her solitary torpedo attack on the Japanese formation—was also hit by gunfire from both sides, set afire, and looped away in her own effort to escape the crossfire.
As Gotō&#x27;s ships endeavored to escape, Scott&#x27;s ships tightened their formation and then turned to pursue the retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from &quot;Kinugasa&quot; barely missed &quot;Boise&quot;. &quot;Boise&quot; and &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving &quot;Kinugasa&quot;″s gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from &quot;Kinugasa&quot; exploded in &quot;Boise&quot;″s main ammunition magazine between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men and threatened to blow the ship apart. Seawater rushed in through rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship&#x27;s powder magazines. &quot;Boise&quot; immediately sheered out of the column and retreated from the action. &quot;Kinugasa&quot; and &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to &quot;Kinugasa&quot; and damaging one of &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;″s boilers, reducing her speed.

At 00:16, Scott ordered his ships to turn to a heading of 330° in an attempt to pursue the fleeing Japanese ships. Scott&#x27;s ships, however, quickly lost sight of Gotō&#x27;s ships, and all firing ceased by 00:20. The American formation was beginning to scatter, so Scott ordered a turn to 205° to disengage.

===Retreat===
During the battle between Scott&#x27;s and Gotō&#x27;s ships, Jojima&#x27;s reinforcement group completed unloading at Guadalcanal and began its return journey unseen by Scott&#x27;s warships, using a route that passed south of the Russell Islands and New Georgia. Despite extensive damage, &quot;Aoba&quot; was able to join &quot;Kinugasa&quot; in retirement to the north through the Slot. &quot;Furutaka&quot;″s damage caused her to lose power around 00:50, and she sank at 02:28, northwest of Savo Island. &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot; picked up &quot;Furutaka&quot;″s survivors and joined the retreat northward.

&quot;Boise&quot; extinguished her fires by 02:40 and at 03:05 rejoined Scott&#x27;s formation. &quot;Duncan&quot;—on fire—was abandoned by her crew at 02:00. Unaware of &quot;Duncan&quot;″s fate, Scott detached &quot;McCalla&quot; to search for her and retired with the rest of his ships towards Nouméa, arriving in the afternoon of 13 October. &quot;McCalla&quot; located the burning, abandoned &quot;Duncan&quot; about 03:00, and several members of &quot;McCalla&quot;″s crew made an attempt to keep her from sinking. By 12:00, however, they had to abandon the effort as bulkheads within &quot;Duncan&quot; collapsed, causing the ship to sink north of Savo Island. American servicemen in boats from Guadalcanal as well as &quot;McCalla&quot; picked up &quot;Duncan&quot;″s scattered survivors from the sea around Savo. In total, 195 &quot;Duncan&quot; sailors survived; 48 did not. As they rescued &quot;Duncan&quot;″s crew, the Americans came across the more than 100 &quot;Fubuki&quot; survivors, floating in the same general area. The Japanese initially refused all rescue attempts but a day later allowed themselves to be picked up and taken prisoner.
Jojima, upon learning of the bombardment force&#x27;s crisis, detached destroyers &quot;Shirayuki&quot; and &quot;Murakumo&quot; to assist &quot;Furutaka&quot; or her survivors and &quot;Asagumo&quot; and to rendezvous with &quot;Kinugasa&quot;, which had paused in her retreat northward to cover the withdrawal of Jojima&#x27;s ships. At 07:00, five CAF Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless dive bombers attacked &quot;Kinugasa&quot; but inflicted no damage. At 08:20, 11 more SBDs found and attacked &quot;Shirayuki&quot; and . Although they scored no direct hits, a near miss caused &quot;Murakumo&quot; to begin leaking oil, marking a trail for other CAF aircraft to follow. A short time later, seven more CAF SBDs and six Grumman TBF-1 Avenger torpedo bombers, accompanied by 14 Grumman F4F-4 Wildcats, found the two Japanese destroyers from Guadalcanal. In the ensuing attack, &quot;Murakumo&quot; was hit by a torpedo in her engineering spaces, leaving her without power. In the meantime, &quot;Aoba&quot; and &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot; reached the sanctuary of the Japanese base in the Shortland Islands at 10:00.

Rushing to assist &quot;Murakumo&quot;, &quot;Asagumo&quot; and &quot;Natsugumo&quot; were attacked by another group of 11 CAF SBDs and TBFs escorted by 12 fighters at 15:45. An SBD placed its bomb almost directly amidships on &quot;Natsugumo&quot; while two more near misses contributed to her severe damage. After &quot;Asagumo&quot; took off her survivors, &quot;Natsugumo&quot; sank at 16:27. The CAF aircraft also scored several more hits on the stationary &quot;Murakumo&quot;, setting her afire. After her crew abandoned ship, &quot;Shirayuki&quot; scuttled her with a torpedo, picked up her survivors, and joined the rest of the Japanese warships for the remainder of their return trip to the Shortland Islands.

==Aftermath and significance==
Captain Kikunori Kijima—Gotō&#x27;s chief of staff and commander of the bombardment force during the return trip to the Shortland Islands after Gotō&#x27;s death in battle—claimed that his force had sunk two American cruisers and one destroyer. &quot;Furutaka&quot;″s Captain Araki Tsuto—who survived the sinking of his ship—blamed the loss of his cruiser on bad air reconnaissance and poor leadership from the 8th fleet staff under Admiral Mikawa. Although Gotō&#x27;s bombardment mission failed, Jojima&#x27;s reinforcement convoy was successful in delivering the crucial men and equipment to Guadalcanal. &quot;Aoba&quot; journeyed to Kure, Japan, for repairs that were completed on 15 February 1943. &quot;Kinugasa&quot; was sunk one month later during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.
Scott claimed that his force sank three Japanese cruisers and four destroyers. News of the victory was widely publicized in the American media. &quot;Boise&quot;—which was damaged enough to require a trip to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for repairs—was dubbed the &quot;one-ship fleet&quot; by the press for her exploits in the battle, although this was mainly because the names of the other involved ships were withheld for security reasons. &quot;Boise&quot; was under repair until 20 March 1943.

Although a tactical victory for the U.S., Cape Esperance had little immediate strategic effect on the situation on Guadalcanal. Just two days later on the night of 13/14 October, the Japanese battleships and bombarded and almost destroyed Henderson Field, firing a total of 918 14-inch shells. One day after that, a large Japanese convoy successfully delivered 4,500 troops and equipment to the island. This was followed on the night of 14/15 October by a bombardment from heavy cruisers and which fired a combined 752 8-inch shells at the airfield, and then again during the night of 15/16 October, this time by heavy cruisers and firing 912 8-inch shells. The delivered troops and equipment helped complete Japanese preparations for the large land offensive scheduled to begin on 23 October. The convoy of U.S. Army troops reached Guadalcanal on 13 October as planned and were key participants for the Allied side in the decisive land battle for Henderson Field that took place from 23–26 October.

The Cape Esperance victory helped prevent an accurate U.S. assessment of Japanese skills and tactics in naval night fighting. The U.S. was still unaware of the range and power of Japanese torpedoes, the effectiveness of Japanese night optics, and the skilled fighting ability of most Japanese destroyer and cruiser commanders. Incorrectly applying the perceived lessons learned from this battle, U.S. commanders in future naval night battles in the Solomons consistently tried to prove that American naval gunfire was more effective than Japanese torpedo attacks. This belief was severely tested just two months later during the Battle of Tassafaronga. A junior officer on &quot;Helena&quot; later wrote, &quot;Cape Esperance was a three-sided battle in which chance was the major winner.&quot;

On 11 October, a large force of carriers and battleships together with their escort groups left Truk and lingered in the area around Guadalcanal, heavily bombarding Henderson field and looking to intercept Allied reinforcement convoys. This buildup of naval forces would culminate in the subsequent Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.

<text>In heraldry, or (/ɔːʁ/; French for &quot;gold&quot;) is the tincture of gold and, together with argent (silver), belongs to the class of light tinctures called &quot;metals&quot;. In engravings and line drawings, it is hatched using a field of evenly spaced dots. It is very frequently depicted as yellow, though gold leaf was used in many illuminated manuscripts and more extravagant rolls of arms.

The word &quot;gold&quot; is occasionally used in place of &quot;or&quot; in blazon, sometimes to prevent repetition of the word &quot;or&quot; in a blazon, or because this substitution was in fashion when the blazon was first written down, or when it is preferred by the officer of arms. The use of &quot;gold&quot; for &quot;or&quot; (and &quot;silver&quot; for &quot;argent&quot;) was a short-lived fashion amongst certain heraldic writers in the mid-20th century who attempted to &quot;demystify&quot; and popularise the subject of heraldry.

&quot;Or&quot; is sometimes spelled with a capital letter (e.g. &quot;Gules, a fess Or&quot;) so as not to confuse it with the conjunction &quot;or&quot;. However, this incorrect heraldic usage is not met with in standard reference works such as Bernard Burke&#x27;s &quot;General Armory&quot;, 1884 and Debrett&#x27;s &quot;Peerage&quot;. Fox-Davies advocated leaving all tinctures uncapitalized. A correctly stated blazon should eliminate any possible confusion between the tincture &quot;or&quot; and the conjunction &quot;or&quot; (which is rare in blazons in any case), certainly for the reader with a basic competence in heraldry. 

&quot;Or plain&quot; are the arms of Spanish family de Menezes.

==Poetic meanings==
The different tinctures are sometimes said to be associated with special meanings and virtues, and with certain elements and precious stones, although these associations have been mostly disregarded by serious heraldists. Sources vary, but or is usually said to represent the following:

* Of jewels, the topaz
* Of heavenly bodies, the Sun
* Of metals, gold
* Of virtues, faith or obedience and gentility

<doc id="1095462" wikidata="Q1837285" url="?curid=1095462" title="Bishop of Norwich">
<text>The Bishop of Norwich is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Norwich in the Province of Canterbury. The diocese covers most of the county of Norfolk and part of Suffolk. The bishop of Norwich is Graham Usher.

The see is in the city of Norwich and the seat is located at the Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity. The bishop&#x27;s residence is Bishop&#x27;s House, Norwich. It is claimed that the bishop is also the abbot of St Benet&#x27;s Abbey, the contention being that instead of dissolving this monastic institution, Henry VIII united the position of abbot with that of bishop of Norwich, making St Benet&#x27;s perhaps the only monastic institution to escape &quot;de jure&quot; dissolution, although it was despoiled by its last abbot.

East Anglia has had a bishopric since 630, when the first cathedral was founded at Dommoc, possibly to be identified as the submerged village of Dunwich. In 673, the see was divided into the bishoprics of Dunwich and Elmham; which were reunited by mid-950s, with the seat located at Elmham. After the Conquest the seat was moved in 1070 to Thetford, before finally being located in Norwich in 1094 under William II, ahead of the completion of the new cathedral building.

==History==
In about 630 or 631, a diocese was established by St. Felix for the Kingdom of the East Angles, with his episcopal seat at Dunwich on the Suffolk coast. In 672, the diocese was divided into the sees of Dunwich and Elmham by St. Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury.

The line of bishops of Elmham continued until it was interrupted by the Danish Viking invasions in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. By the mid 950s, the sees of Elmham and Dunwich were reunited under one bishop, with the episcopal see at Elmham. After the Norman conquest, the see was transferred to Thetford in 1075, and soon afterwards to Norwich in 1094.

Though the see took the name Norwich in the 11th century, its history goes back 400 years earlier, to the final conversion of the kingdom of East Anglia by St Felix. The East Angles became Christian during the reign of Sigeberht, who succeeded to the kingdom in 628. Felix fixed his see at Dommoc, which may have been at Dunwich, now almost entirely submerged off the coast of Suffolk. From there he evangelized the areas corresponding to the modern counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, which later were to form the diocese of Norwich. He was succeeded in turn by Thomas in 647, Brigilsus (died about 669) and Bifus. Upon the death of Bifus, in 673 Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, divided the see between Dunwich and Elmham.

The see of Elmham came to an end in about 870, after the East Anglian king Edmund and the bishop Humbertus were murdered by the Danes. East Anglia was ravaged, the churches and monasteries destroyed, and Christianity was only practised with difficulty. Wilred, Bishop of Dunwich seems then to have reunited the dioceses, choosing Elmham as his see. The line of his successors at Elmham then descended to Herfast, a chaplain to William the Conqueror, who removed his see to Thetford Priory and died in 1084.

Herbert de Losinga obtained his appointment in 1091 by means of a simoniacal gift to King William Rufus to secure his election, but being subsequently struck with remorse went to Rome in 1094 to obtain absolution from the pope. Herbert founded a priory in Norwich in expiation for his sin and at the same time moved his see there from Thetford in 1094 under William. The See of Thetford was formed when Herfast moved the episcopal see from Elmham to Thetford in 1075. This short-lived see continued until it was moved to Norwich in 1094. The chapter of secular canons was dissolved and monks took their place. The foundation-stone of the new cathedral at Norwich was laid in 1096, in honour of the Blessed Trinity. By the time of his death in 1119, Herbert de Losinga had completed the choir, which is apsidal and encircled by a procession path, and which originally gave access to three Norman chapels. His successor, Everard, completed the long Norman nave so that the cathedral is a very early twelfth-century building, modified naturally by later additions and alterations. The chief of these is the Lady Chapel (c. 1250, destroyed by the Protestant Dean Gardiner 1573–1589); the cloisters (c. 1300), the West Window (c. 1440), the rood screen, the spire and the vault spanning the nave (c. 1450). The cathedral suffered much from iconoclasm during the Reformation and the civil wars.

The Norwich diocese consisted of Norfolk and Suffolk with some parts of Cambridgeshire, being divided into four archdeaconries: Norfolk, Norwich, Suffolk, and Sudbury. At the end of the seventeenth century there were 1,121 parish-churches, and this number had probably not changed much since Catholic times.

The main religious houses in the medieval diocese were the Benedictine Abbeys of Bury St Edmunds, Wymondham, and St Benet&#x27;s of Hulme, the cathedral priory of Norwich, along with the Cistercian Abbey of Sibton, the only Cistercian Abbey in East Anglia (the ruins now privately owned by the Levett-Scrivener family), and the abbeys of the Augustinian Canons at Wendling, Langley, and Laystone. Both Dominican and Franciscan convents were to be found at Lynn, Norwich, Yarmouth, Dunwich, and Ipswich, while the Dominicans also had houses at Thetford and Sudbury and the Franciscans at Bury St Edmund&#x27;s and at Walsingham, where the great shrine of Our Lady was, a foundation of Augustinian canons. The Carmelites were at Lynn, Norwich, Yarmouth, and Blakeney; and the Austin Friars at Norwich, Lynn, and Orford.

The last bishop before the start of the English Reformation was Richard Nykke (succeeded 1501), who was succeeded by William Rugg in 1536. After him came in 1550 Thomas Thirlby, who had already been appointed Bishop of Westminster by the King alone but was reconciled to the Pope in the reign of Queen Mary. After him in 1554 came John Hopton, the last Bishop of Norwich in communion with Rome, who died in 1558. In the early 17th century, Bishop Wren urged the restoration and beautification of churches, much previously neglected, and the use of copes in worship against a background of resistance. Several successors including Richard Montagu a public controversialist, continued attempts to restore a degree of catholic worship. However, Norwich was heavily influenced by Puritanism and in 1643, a Puritan mob invaded the cathedral and destroyed all Catholic symbols. (The bishop of the day, Joseph Hall, wrote despairingly of the despoliation, in his book, &quot;Hard Measures&quot;). Almost in ruins, the cathedral would be repaired at the Restoration.

==Assistant bishops==

Among those who have served the diocese as assistant bishops have been:
*1450–1477: Thomas Scrope, absentee (or former) Bishop of Dromore and assistant Bishop of Canterbury in 1469. Consecrated 1 February 1450, by Angelo Capranica, Archbishop of Ascoli Piceno, at Santa Maria in Aquiro. Also called Thomas (de) Bradley for his Leicestershire birthplace; Carmelite friar; vicar-general to the bishop of Norwich; died 1491/2 — allegedly aged 100 — in Lowestoft, where he was buried.
*19311951 (d.): Edwin Robins, Vicar of Wicklewood (until 1947) and former bishop of Athabasca
*1953–1955: Wilfrid Belcher, Rector of Diss and former Bishop of North Queensland

==Port-passing etiquette==

When port wine is passed around at British meals, one tradition dictates that a diner passes the decanter to the left immediately after pouring a glass for his or her neighbour on the right; the decanter should not stop its clockwise progress around the table until it is finished. If someone is seen to have failed to follow tradition, the breach is brought to their attention by asking &quot;Do you know the Bishop of Norwich?&quot;; those aware of the tradition treat the question as a reminder, while those who do not are told &quot;He&#x27;s a terribly good chap, but he always forgets to pass the port.&quot;

It is unclear which, if any, Bishop of Norwich was the inspiration for this custom. Several candidates have been put forward but decisive contemporary evidence is wanting for all of them.

1) Lewis Bagot, who supposedly &#x27;hogged&#x27; the port at a dinner at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. 

2) Henry Bathurst, who used to fall asleep during meals and hence was unable to pass the port. He was still bishop in his 90s. 

3) John Sheepshanks. He is sometimes put forward as a candidate but with even less justification than the other two.

<text>Following the success of Hurst components in Oldsmobile&#x27;s 442 models, Oldsmobile, in collaboration with Hurst Performance of Warminster, Pennsylvania, produced special-edition performance versions of the 442 or Cutlass Supreme, the Hurst/Olds.

==1968==
The first Hurst/Olds was the 1968 Hurst/Olds. It shared its body with the regular Oldsmobile Cutlass and 442, but had a unique Peruvian Silver and Black paint scheme. The Hurst/Olds was powered by a @ 5000 rpm and a maximum torque of @ 3200 rpm, 308° duration cam W-45 (without A/C) or 285/287° duration cam W-46 (with A/C), with a displacement of Rocket V8, equipped with a single 4-barrel Rochester Quadrajet 4GC carburetor. This engine was similar to the W-34 455 engine offered in the Toronado and the W-33 455 option available on the full-sized Delta 88. The W-45 and the milder W-46 engines differed in camshaft and cylinder head selection. The 455 was mated to a code OW three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission with console-mounted Hurst Dual-Gate shifter that permitted automatic or manually ratcheted shifting.
515 production examples of the 1968 model were built in 2 body styles. There were 51 Sport coupes and 464 Holiday coupes manufactured.
The Hurst/Olds was the only GM intermediate-sized car to offer an engine larger than thanks to a corporate policy at that time which prohibited the divisions from putting larger engines in cars smaller than full-sized models other than the Chevrolet Corvette. Oldsmobile got around the 400 cubic-inch limit by implying that the engines were installed by Hurst, not Olds. In fact, the special drivetrain and ram-air package (shared with the W-30 and W-31) was installed at the factory. The cars were then taken across town (Lansing, Michigan) to Demmer Engineering where the remainder of the unique Hurst components were added. This included black accent paint with hand-applied white pinstripes, real walnut dash trim, H/O emblems, and Dual Gate shifter and mini-console.

==1969==

The Hurst/Olds returned for the 1969 model year. The biggest change was the switch from the silver and black paint scheme of &#x27;68 to a new Firefrost gold on white paint scheme. This would be the primary paint scheme for many Hurst/Olds models of later years. Instead of the dual ram air scoops under the front bumper that was used in &#x27;68 and other ram air &#x27;69s, the H/O received a functional &quot;mailbox&quot; fiberglass hood scoop with H/O 455 on each side. A spoiler was mounted on the trunk and the car sat on unique 15x7 chrome SSII rims with Goodyear F60x15 Polyglas tires. The exterior was finished off with a pair of English racing mirrors, H/O emblems on the front fenders and deck lid, blacked out 442 grilles, and black hand-applied pinstripes. All of the &#x27;68 and &#x27;69 H/Os were pinstriped by one person. Interior modifications included a different wood veneer on the mini-console, painted gold stripes on the headrests, and a Hurst/Olds emblem on the glove-box door. The non-drive train modifications were again done at Demmer Engineering. Approximately 913 cars were built including 2 convertibles for Hurst promotional use, one for East coast events and one for West coast events(a third was built after one of the original two was destroyed).

The 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 (W46) was rated at and 500 lb/ft of torque. This is the same engine as A/C equipped 68 Hurst Olds&#x27; and provided better drivability. The same engine was used for both A/C and non-A/C cars. The engine received a unique intake manifold, chrome steel valve covers, and a special vacuum operated air cleaner lid to allow cold air from the hood scoop into the carburetor. This was backed up by a specially calibrated code OH Turbo 400 transmission and 3.42 gears for non-A/C cars or 3.08 gears for cars with A/C. Optional 3.91 gears were available only for non-A/C cars.
The Hurst/Olds was temporarily dropped after the 1969 model year because GM dropped the 400 cubic-inch engine limit for the 1970 model year, which permitted the divisions to install larger engines in their intermediate musclecars. For 1970, the regular 442 came standard with a 365-horsepower 455 Rocket V8, or an optional W-30 version of same engine. For 1970, Olds planned to bring back the Hurst/Olds, but as a lower-priced companion to the 442 with a smaller 350 cubic-inch V8 and special graphics. That planned &#x27;70 H/O ended up being introduced as the mid-year Rallye 350, which featured a bright yellow paint scheme for the body along with front and rear bumpers coated with matching yellow urethane. The next Hurst/Olds would be introduced as a 1972 model. The Hurst branding was used for 1970 only on the Chrysler 300 Hurst Edition

==1972==
The 1972 Hurst/Olds was actually developed by Hurst Performance, and not Oldsmobile. Due to a tragic accident involving the 1971 Indy Pace car, a Dodge Challenger, the major auto manufacturers were reluctant to provide the pace car for the 1972 Indy race. Hurst Performance stepped up and volunteered to sponsor the 1972 Pace car. Oldsmobile provided the Cutlass Supreme coupe and convertible. It was the only time an Indy Pace car was sponsored by a manufacturer other than an automobile manufacturer, and first time to include a major supplier&#x27;s name in the title. The 1972 edition of the Hurst/Olds had some of the lowest production numbers of any produced with a total of 629 made; 130 Convertibles, 220 hardtop with sunroof, 6 Station Wagons for Press and Ambulance use, and 279 hardtop cars. The only color available was Cameo White with reflective 3M gold stripes that were stickers, not paint. All of the cars had the W-25 Ram Air Hood and gold SS III Rally Wheels with a chrome bolt-on center cap and chrome beauty ring. The tires were Goodyear Polysteel Radials. The standard Hurst/Olds engine was the L75 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at 250 net horsepower (U in VIN). Optional at extra cost was the W-30 option with the L77 455, a blueprinted engine rated at 300 net horsepower (X in VIN). Both engines were mated to a Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission with console-mounted Hurst Dual-Gate shifter. All of the 1972 Hurst/Olds had the black Strato bucket interior with a center console. Special Hurst/Olds Pace Car badging adorned the glove box door and all 1972 Hurst/Olds&#x27; were identified with a W-45 Code on the cowl tag.

==1973==

The new Hurst Olds shared with all 1973 GM A body cars, the most extensive redesign in their 10-year history The chassis was as new as the bodies -Wheelbase dimensions were a sporty 112 inches for coupes and 116 inches for sedans and station wagons on an all-new sturdier perimeter frame with increased front and rear suspension travel, larger 8½ inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm bushings and new shock absorber location, new body mounts and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car&#x27;s weight. Power brakes with front disc brake calipers were now standard on all &#x27;73 Cutlasses.

Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush style outside door handles, molded full foam front and rear seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger 22 gallon fuel tank, and &quot;flush and dry&quot; rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size GM cars. Another structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. Options included swiveling Strato-bucket seats (with console) for coupes, a power moonroof, and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster.

The Oldsmobile Cutlass (including the Hurst/Olds and 442) changed body styles to the &quot;Colonnade&quot; body style, which was used until 1977. The Hurst Olds was based on the semi-fastback Cutlass S coupe and featured an interior with swiveling Strato bucket seats separated by a console with Hurst Dual-Gate shifter for the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. The sole engine offering was a 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8, with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts, with the L75 U code engine. Also available was the L77 V code 455 with available only without air conditioning. Although Pontiac&#x27;s SD 455 cubic-inch engine lasted one more year with , Oldsmobile&#x27;s high performance 455 engine would only last one more year culminating with the L76 optioned 455 W-30 Hurst/Olds in 1974. The &#x27;73 model was the first Hurst Olds to be offered in two color schemes-black/gold or white/gold. A grand total of 1,097 Hurst/Olds were produced for 1973 with about 60% being white/gold and about 40% being black/gold under option code W-45, unless ordered without air conditioning, which was option code W-46. Hurst-only options included a console mounted digital tachometer, air shocks, and alarm system.

==1974==

The Hurst/Olds returned in 1974 with the &quot;Colonnade&quot; body style. This year the Hurst/Olds was also the Indianapolis 500 pace car, which was available as a graphics package option to the Hurst/Olds owner. 1800 1974 Hurst/Olds&#x27; were produced in 1974, 380 of them were the W-30 version which designated the 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 and produced 230 net horsepower. The other 1420 had a 350 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with , which was also the only engine available for California cars.
The 1974 Hurst/Olds was intended to be a pace car but because the Indy 500 track required convertibles for the parade lap cars, the Delta 88 was chosen.
These cars were used as track cars to parade celebrities and guests on the track. There were a total of 92 Hurst/Olds Parade cars.

==1975==
The Hurst/Olds in 1975 was the first General Motors car to have &quot;Hurst/Hatch&quot; removable T-Top style roof installed. The car is based on the formal-roofed Cutlass Supreme coupe rather than the semi-fastback Cutlass S used in 1973–74.
The car was available in either black or white, with either a black or white half vinyl top offset by a wide aluminum band. Either a W-25, equipped with an Oldsmobile 350 engine, or a W-30, equipped with an Oldsmobile 455 engine could be had. Due to the environmental regulations at the time, this was the first year that the United States Environmental Protection Agency mandated the addition of catalytic converters mounted in the exhaust system. Due to the added expense, only single exhaust was available.

The hood from the 1974 Hurst/Olds, with the center mounted louvers, carried over. Gold stripes adorned the sides of the car, as well as the trunk, hood, and mirrors. The car also carried gold 15&quot;x7&quot; Super Stock III Oldsmobile rims.
Interiors were similar to 1974 except for revised door panels and new reversible vinyl/velour seat cushions and backs for the all-vinyl Strato bucket seats. The most popular interior color combination on &#x27;75 Hurst/Olds was white seats and door panels, and black carpet, dashboard, steering wheel and console. Additional colors such as red and beige dashboard, carpet and seat cushions was also available.
The Hurst Performance &#x27;Dual Gate&#x27; Shifter carried on for 1975. An optional digital LED numerical readout tachometer was available and mounted on the center console by Hurst Performance.

==1979==

Another car, now called simply the Hurst/Olds, appeared in 1979, based on the Cutlass Calais coupe. It used the L34, Oldsmobile&#x27;s 5.7 L (350 in³) V8 engine. A Hurst Dual Gate shifter was standard. After a three-year hiatus, the H/O returned for 1979 on GM&#x27;s newly downsized Cutlass body. The first H/O to be built entirely by Oldsmobile Division, it was also the first H/O that did not offer a 455 engine. It was, however, the only GM G-body to offer a 350 V8 in 1979. It was also the first W-30 to come with the Olds 350 and not the Olds 455. White and black again were the color choices, but with a wider choice of interior trims than ever before. Gold paint covered the hood, most of the top, and the very rear of the trunk. The aluminum wheels were also painted gold, along with the grille. This H/O was built by Oldsmobile at the Lansing plant.

Known as the W-30, it was produced for the following year in the 1980 Olds 442. The only major differences between the 1979 and the 1980 were the headlights, and the 1979 also had the dual gate Hurst shifter.

==1983–1984==
After the Cutlass line was split between the front-wheel drive A-body Cutlass Ciera and the rear-wheel drive G-body Cutlass Supreme in 1982, GM again offered a limited-edition Hurst/Olds - it was the 15th anniversary of the first Hurst/Olds introduced in 1968.
The Hurst Lightning Rod floor shifter was introduced in the &#x27;83 H/O.
For its 15th Anniversary Edition, the &#x27;83 H/O came only in black with silver rocker panels. Chrome 15&quot; wheels fitted Goodyear Eagle GT tires, and a power bulge hood and rear spoiler gave the car a purposeful look. A modified version of Oldsmobile&#x27;s 307 CID V8 was installed, along with 3.73 gears and Hurst&#x27;s radical Lightning Rods shifter. Dual exhausts with rumbling mufflers meant there was no mistaking the H/O for a garden variety Cutlass. A new style &quot;Hurst/Olds&quot; emblem was introduced, and red and silver stripes separated the black and silver paint. Demand for the car was very strong. Originally, 2500 units were scheduled to be produced, but Olds had to up that number to 3001 because of high demand. That may have been a factor in bringing the H/O back for &#x27;84. The paint scheme was reversed, with silver being the main body color, and black on the rocker panels. In most respects, the &#x27;84 was mechanically identical to the &#x27;83. The &#x27;84 did get a stronger 8.5&quot; rear end. 3500 units were produced in 1984.

A fully loaded 1984 H/O model cost $19,500 ($ in dollars ) while a base model was priced around $11,000 ($ in dollars ).

<text>The MDM Observatory (Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT Observatory; obs. code: 697) is an optical astronomical observatory located adjacent to Kitt Peak National Observatory on Kitt Peak, west of Tucson, Arizona, in the United States. It is owned and operated by the University of Michigan, Dartmouth College, Ohio State University, Columbia University, and Ohio University. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was also part of the operating consortium in the past.

It has two reflecting telescopes, the 2.4-meter (95 inches aperture Hiltner Telescope (since 1986), used for galactic surveys, and the 1.3-meter (50 inch diameter aperture) McGraw–Hill Telescope (since 1975), which was originally located near Ann Arbor, Michigan.

== Hiltner Telescope ==

The mirror of the 2.4-meter Hiltner Telescope is aluminum-coated Cer-Vit, and usable foci include f/7.5 and f/13.5 Cassegrain foci. The telescope was built in 1986 and the mirrors were re-polished in 1991. It was named after astronomer W. Albert Hiltner (1914-1991).

The Hiltner was one of the telescopes that observed the &quot;turn on&quot; transient of a galactic nucleus, along with the Swift space telescope (aka Neil Gehrels &quot;Swift&quot; Observatory since 2018) and the Gemini observatory (8 meter ground observatory). The transient event was called PS1-13cbe and was located in the Galaxy SDSS J222153.87+003054.2.

== McGraw–Hill Telescope ==
The 1.3-meter McGraw-Hill Telescope, with a 1.27-meter clear aperture, is an aluminum-coated Cer-Vit (low thermal expansion glass) telescope. Its usable foci include f/7.5 and f/13.5. The telescope was originally installed at Stinchfield Woods, Michigan in 1969, and moved in 1975 to MDM.

=== Asteroid 4432 McGraw-Hill ===

The asteroid 4432 McGraw-Hill is named after this telescope. It was discovered on March 2, 1981 by Schelte J. Bus at Siding Spring in the course of the UK Schmidt-Caltech Asteroid Survey. On February 18, 1992, the International Astronomical Union officially assigned the name &quot;McGraw-Hill&quot; to the asteroid. The text of the citation, as officially published by IAU Commission 20 (), is as follows:

<doc id="1095479" wikidata="Q2004448" url="?curid=1095479" title="Simon Episcopius">
<text>Simon Episcopius (8 January 1583 – 4 April 1643) was a Dutch theologian and Remonstrant who played a significant role at the Synod of Dort in 1618. His name is the Latinized form of his Dutch name Simon Bisschop.

==Life==
Born in Amsterdam, in 1600 he entered the University of Leiden, where he studied theology under Jacobus Arminius, whose teaching he followed, and Franciscus Gomarus. He graduated M.A. in 1606, but his appointment as a minister was questioned from the Calvinist side. He went to the University of Franeker, where he heard Johannes Drusius. In 1610, the year in which the Arminians presented the Remonstrance to the states of Holland, he became pastor at Bleyswick, a village near Rotterdam; in the following year he advocated the cause of the Remonstrants at The Hague conference (1611), and again at Delft in 1613.

In 1612 he succeeded Francis Gomarus as professor of theology at Leiden; his appointment awakened the bitter enmity of some of the Calvinists. He was attacked by Festus Hommius in &quot;Specimen controversiarum Belgicarum&quot; (1618).

At the Synod of Dort in 1618, Episcopius was chosen as the spokesman of the thirteen representatives of the Remonstrants before the synod; but he was refused a hearing. At the end of the Synod&#x27;s sittings in 1619, Episcopius and the other twelve Arminian representatives were deprived of their offices and expelled from the country.

Episcopius retired to Antwerp and ultimately to France, where he lived partly at Paris, partly at Rouen. He devoted most of his time to writings in support of the Arminian cause. He notably wrote the &quot;Remonstrant Confession&quot; (1621). But the attempt of Luke Wadding to convert him to Catholicism involved him also in a controversy. After the death (1625) of Maurice, prince of Orange, the violence of the Arminian controversy began to abate, and Episcopius was permitted in 1626 to return to his own country. In 1630, he was appointed preacher at the Remonstrant church in Rotterdam. In 1634 he became rector of the Remonstrant college in Amsterdam, where he died in 1643.

==Views==

Episcopius may be regarded as in great part the theological founder of Arminianism, since he developed and systematized the principles tentatively enunciated by Arminius. Besides opposing at all points the peculiar doctrines of Calvinism, Episcopius protested against the tendency of Calvinists to lay so much stress on abstract dogma, and argued that Christianity was practical rather than theoretical – not so much a system of intellectual belief as a moral power – and that an orthodox faith did not necessarily imply the knowledge of and assent to a system of doctrine which included the whole range of Christian truth, but only the knowledge and acceptance of so much of Christianity as was necessary to effect a real change on the heart and life.

<text>Luke Wadding (16 October 158818 November 1657), was an Irish Franciscan friar and historian.

==Life==

===Early life===
Wadding was born on 16 October 1588 in Waterford to Walter Wadding of Waterford, a wealthy merchant, and his wife, Anastasia Lombard (sister of Peter Lombard, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland). Educated at the school of Mrs. Jane Barden in Waterford and of Peter White in Kilkenny, in 1604 he went to study in Lisbon and at the University of Coimbra.

===Franciscan friar===
After completing his university studies, Wadding became a Franciscan friar in 1607 and spent his novitiate at Matosinhos, Portugal. He was ordained priest in 1613 by João Manuel, Bishop of Viseu, and in 1617 he was made President of the Irish College at the University of Salamanca, and Master of Students and Professor of Divinity. The next year, he went to Rome as chaplain to the Spanish ambassador to the Papal States, Bishop Antonio Trejo de Sande, O.F.M. Wadding collected the funds for the establishment of the College of St. Isidore in Rome, for the education of Irish priests, opened 24 June 1625, with four lecturers – Anthony O&#x27;Hicidh of a famous literary family in Thomond, Martin Breathnach from Donegal, Patrick Fleming from Louth, and John Punch from Cork. He gave the college a library of 5,000 printed books and 800 manuscripts, and thirty resident students soon came. Wadding served as rector of the college for 15 years. From 1630 to 1634, he was Procurator of the Order of Friars Minor at their headquarters in Rome, and Vice Commissary from 1645 to 1648. During the papal conclaves of 1644 and 1655, Wadding received votes to become pope, making him &quot;as close as the church has come to having an Irish pope.&quot;

Wadding was an enthusiastic supporter of the Irish Catholics during the Irish Confederate Wars, and his college became the strongest advocate of the Irish cause in Rome. (This spirit of patriotism originated by Wadding had a lasting impact, so that in the 19th century, Sir George Errington, who was sent by British prime minister Gladstone to explain the relation of English and Irish politics in Rome, reported that those Irish politicians thought most extreme in England were conservatives compared with the collegians of St. Isidore.) Wadding sent officers and arms to Ireland, and induced Pope Innocent X to send Giovanni Battista Rinuccini there.

The Confederate Catholics petitioned Pope Urban VIII to make Wadding a cardinal, but he found ways to intercept the petition, and it remained in the archives of the college.

Luke Wadding was an important art patron. He commissioned artworks for St. Isidore&#x27;s church in Rome. The painters Andrea Sacchi and Carlo Maratti were among the most famous artists commissioned by Wadding.

==Death==
Wadding died on 18 November 1657 at the age of 69 and is buried in the church of the College of San Isidore, in Rome. His life was written by Francis Harold, his nephew. The learned Franciscan friar Bonaventura Baron was another nephew.

==Legacy==

Wadding founded the Pontifical Irish College for Irish secular clergy. In 1900, Wadding&#x27;s portrait and part of his library were in the Franciscan friary on Merchant&#x27;s Quay, Dublin. Through Wadding&#x27;s efforts, St Patrick&#x27;s Day became a feast day. But it would take years for it to develop, taking until the 20th century for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parades to occur in his native Ireland, while the first organized celebration in America took place in the 18th century in cities like Boston and New York, and today occurs in faraway places like Russia and Japan. Amid all the celebrations, most Irish today do not know about the &quot;Waterford man who created St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.&quot;

Prior to the 1950s, when work began on a new critical edition, the &quot;Wadding Edition&quot; of the works of Duns Scotus was the most complete version of the thought of the Subtle Doctor available to scholars. The work was compiled in 1639, when Wadding was in Rome, and updated in the 1890s. Whilst containing a number of spurious works, as of 2021, with the new Vatican Edition of Scotus yet to be completed, the Wadding Edition remains an important and influential collection.

In the 1950s, a statue of Wadding by Gabriel Hayes was erected on the Mall in Waterford, adjacent to Reginald&#x27;s Tower and one of the city&#x27;s most prominent locations. The Waterford-born Franciscan&#x27;s literary, academic and theological attributes were denoted by a quill pen held poised in the statue&#x27;s right hand. More recently this statue was replaced by one of Thomas Francis Meagher. The figure of Luke Wadding was moved to a position at the entrance to the French Church, Waterford on Greyfriars.

In 2000, the Waterford Institute of Technology dedicated a new library building to his name.

==Works==
A voluminous writer, his chief work was the &quot;Annales Minorum&quot; in 8 folio volumes (1625–1654), re-edited in the 18th century and continued up to the year 1622; it is the classical work on Franciscan history. He also published a &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Franciscan writers, an edition of the works of Duns Scotus, and the first collection of the writings of St Francis of Assisi.

Wadding published a total of 36 volumes – fourteen at Rome, twenty-one at Lyon, and one at Antwerp.

* &quot;Annales Minorum&quot;, in eight volumes (1625–54)
* &quot;Duns Scotus&quot; in twelve volumes (1639, fol.)
* &quot;πρεσβεία&quot; [Presbeia] published at Louvain (1624)
:a treatise on the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin. The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin, the works of Duns Scotus, and the history of the Franciscan order were his favourite subjects of study.
* &quot;De Hebraicæ linguæ origine, præstantia, et utilitate&quot;
:his essay is prefixed to the concordance of the Hebrew scriptures of Mario di Calasio, which Wadding prepared for the press in 1621.

<text>The British Rail Classes 101 and 102 diesel-mechanical multiple units were built by Metro-Cammell at Washwood Heath in Birmingham, England, from 1956 to 1959, following construction of a series of prototype units. These classes proved to be some of the most successful and longest-lived of BR&#x27;s &quot;First Generation&quot; DMUs, second in longevity only to the Class 121, with the final five units being withdrawn on 24 December 2003. The oldest set was, by then, just over 47 years old.

==Background==

In 1955, British Rail published a Modernisation Plan to streamline the railway network, bringing it up to date in comparison to European standards. Steam power would be phased out in favour of diesel powered railcars and locomotives, and projects were put out to tender. BR hoped that by replacing steam with DMUs, costs would be reduced sufficiently to make rural lines viable.

Since there was no time for BR to issue a standard specification, train builders were invited to submit plans on the understanding that the units could be built and put into service quickly. Having gained experience with early lightweight DMUs, Metro Cammell won a contract and put the Class 101 into production. The type featured a steel chassis with an aluminium body to reduce weight. Five orders for batches were placed for the type.

Metro-Cammell advertised their new train highlighting the wide availability and modern features the 101 offered. Demand was so high that at one point four cars per week were rolling off the Washwood Heath production lines. The trains underwent testing on the Sutton Park line near the works from 1956, before the sets were released to BR.

The 101s came in two, three or four car units, with two driving carriages one or two of which were powered by 11.3 litre BUT six cylinder diesel engines with epicyclic gearboxes. Being a first generation DMU, they were a prime example of a slam door train. They had a top speed of .

==Operations==

The 101 DMU fleet was vast with 527 101s and 106 of the related Class 102s being built. The two types were distinguished by the type of engine fitted, but were eventually classified together as Class 101s only. In all, 760 individual vehicles were built in total, 465 were for the Eastern Region and North Eastern Region, 159 for the Scottish Region and 139 for the London Midland Region.

In the mid-1970s, the type was chosen for a refurbishment to extend their service life. Vehicle interiors were improved with the fitting of fluorescent lighting, new upholstery and carpeting, and fitting of extra heating equipment. They also had uprated engines fitted. The work was carried out by BR Doncaster.

The Class 111 was a variant of the 101, having more powerful Rolls-Royce engines. They were built to serve Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire PTE. The 111 lasted in service until 1989, fourteen years earlier than the 101.

The 101 fleet was used across much of the British Rail network (with the notable exception of the Southern Region - apart from some inter-regional workings). Notable concentration of services included:

===Scotland===
Class 101s operated various routes in Scotland starting in July 1958. Edinburgh - Dundee was a regular working, with units stabled at Dundee depot. Upon ScotRail&#x27;s formation, the units continued in use and were in service up to Privatisation in 1997, with some painted in orange and black Strathclyde PTE livery.
In January 1984, a fire at Ayr depot destroyed six 101s and as a result an equivalent number of Class 104 were drafted in to fill the gap.

Upon Privatisation in 1997, ScotRail retained eleven units in service, running the Glasgow to Barrhead, East Kilbride, Paisley Canal and Whifflet as well as the Motherwell to Cumbernauld services. Although Class 101s were a common sight in Scotland up to the late 90s, they started to disappear from high level with the introduction of the Class 156. Newer Class 170s started a stock cascade and the type&#x27;s withdrawal began. Upon the 101s final withdrawal from Scotland in November 1999, the remaining sets were returned to Manchester.

===Wales===
The type was seen in South Wales working commuter routed around the Valleys and West Wales Line until the early 1990s, and on rural Welsh lines until the early 2000s. In the 1970s, a diagram from Birmingham to Aberystwyth via the Cambrian Line was a regular route for the 101s. From 1982, they were used on the Central Wales Line between Shrewsbury and Swansea. The 101s were scheduled along with a mixture of other first generation DMUs and Sprinters to work the Crewe - Holyhead services from the early 1980s.

===West Midlands===
Starting on 14 April 1958, the region received a batch of two and three car units. Class 101s were extensively used for commuter services on the Cross-City Line and Chase Line in Birmingham and services to Worcester before being put to work in outlying areas.

Operating from Tyseley depot, the type was used all over the West Midlands well into the 1980s. Just as with the Class 116 which was also heavily used on the same routes, the 101s were withdrawn from WMPTE service on 12 July 1993 when the Cross-City Line was fully electrified. In all, the 101 served the West Midlands for over 35 years.

===Teesside===
Arriving in 1957 at the newly opened Darlington depot, the 101s were initially used on runs between Darlington and Saltburn on the Tees Valley Line. Most of the first batch of 101s ordered were allocated to Darlington. The class continued to serve the line well into the 1980s. The type was withdrawn 21 September 1989 in favour of Pacers.

===Tyneside===

The initial order of 339 vehicles were allocated to the Tyneside area. The 101s first went into service on 24 October 1956 when seven 4-car and 10 2-car units were delivered. A route from Newcastle to Middlesbrough followed. From February 1957, they began operating a stopping service between Newcastle and Carlisle. A longer diagram between Newcastle and Leeds offered a buffet service. The 101s routes were expanded to the whole Tyneside area, replacing the local steam-hauled services. This included the Alston line between Haltwhistle and Alston where the class operated until the line closed in 1976.

Later services were run by Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive and stabled at South Gosforth depot. They remained in service in the region until 30 May 1981 when they were superseded by the Tyne and Wear Metro. At which point, the class was withdrawn and the sets sent to Neville Hill depot in Leeds to be re-deployed.

===West and South Yorkshire===

An initial batch of 10 units went into service in Bradford in December 1956. Operating out of Neville Hill depot in Leeds, the 101s were used extensively for short commuter services. Because of the relatively underpowered engines, the more powerful Class 111 was paired up with some 101 units, while others were moved to other depots. Occasional services between York - Manchester and beyond were worked via the Calder Valley. Regular services were run between Leeds, Bradford, York and Sheffield but the units could also be seen in places such as Scarborough and Whitby.

===Western Region===

From 1967, several 101 sets were transferred to serve the South West. Services from Reading to Gatwick Airport and Oxford to Paddington were common. Diagrams expanded as more 101s arrived in the region with regular runs in the Bristol area. They were stabled at Reading and Plymouth Laira depots, with the units serving until 1987 when they were largely replaced by Class 108s. Several 101s received Network Southeast branding and by the early 1990s had been scaled back to running local services between Didcot, Oxford and Bicester. However, some 101 units were still working in the Plymouth area as late as May 1993 with the final withdrawal coming in 1996.

Thanks to the withdrawal of other units and types, 101s were paired up with different carriages. From the early 1980s it was not uncommon for example for a 101 trailer to be paired to another first generation DMU driving car on various routes and different regions.

===East Anglia===
First introduced in the region in January 1970, the 101 units were allocated to Norwich depot and used on rural lines, notably Norwich to Sheringham and on the Fen line, as well as regular services to Ipswich amongst others. In later years, additional units were based at Cambridge. The Cambridge-based trains primarily ran shuttle services from Cambridge to Royston and from Hitchin to Huntingdon. However, with the electrification of the region and introduction of newer rolling stock, by the early 1990s they had fallen out of favour and were re-allocated to other parts of the rail network. The remaining 101 unit was finally withdrawn from Norwich in August 1996.

===Greater Manchester===

When the Pacers serving Manchester to Blackpool shortly after their introduction proved unreliable in the mid-1980s, the 101 filled the gap at short notice despite not being common in the region.
The 101s were then rolled out across the Greater Manchester area.

Despite the intention to phase out the type and other Heritage DMUs in favour of newer stock, the 101 proved to be a dependable workhorse. Thirty five units were removed from service by 1992 and received a further refurbishment. At this point, they were repainted in Regional Railways livery, and had the class number applied concurrently with several Sprinter and Pacer sets. The work was once again undertaken at Doncaster. Along with other first generation types, corrosion of the body panels and asbestos used during construction was seen as major concerns and were leading causes for their eventual retirement.

Once the units from Scotland had returned, they were put into use working the rural lines around Greater Manchester, especially the Buxton and Hope Valley Lines on services into Manchester Picadilly. It was intended to phase the 101s out of service in favour of the Class 142 in the late 1990s, but the Privatisation of British Rail delayed those plans.

===Post privatisation===

Following privatisation the remaining 101 sets in mainline service fell under the ownership of Angel Trains and operated by the First North Western franchise once the units from Scotland had been returned to Manchester. FNW declined to repaint the trains again, and they retained their former liveries. A total of 18 sets were in service initially. Ongoing problems with the Pacer units and the Sprinters&#x27; use on other lines meant that the 101s were called on to continue in service. The 101s outlasted the Class 141 Pacer in service, a type which had been intended to replace the older unit.

The 101 was seen regularly running on the North Wales Coast Line service between Crewe and Holyhead alongside loco hauled trains as late as 1999. The type was unsuited to the route, and was replaced with the British Rail Class 175 from 2000. It fell to the 101s to run the stopping service from Manchester to Stoke-on-Trent, along with other rural routes in the north west.

Beginning in late 2000, the age of the units was starting to tell and the remaining 101s were gradually retired. They were used exclusively on the Hope Valley services until the end of their career. The very last scheduled service for the type anywhere was run on 24 December 2003 between Rose Hill and Manchester Piccadilly at which point the final five units were decommissioned from service, and sent to Shoeburyness for storage.

===Farewell===

Because of the type&#x27;s popularity and longevity in service, a final farewell tour for the 101s was run in late 2003 which was a railtour of northwest England.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 10 August 1961, Class 45 D105 running light to Neville Hill over-ran signals and collided with a Leeds - Scarborough Class 101 almost opposite Leeds East Signal Box. Leaking diesel caught fire and the leading two DMU vehicles (51440 &amp; 59533) overturned, but were returned to traffic after repair. One person was killed, and two injured. The driver of the locomotive mistakenly accepted the signal that had been cleared for the DMU.
* On 15 June 1965, an empty stock train passed a colour light signal and two ground subsidiary signals at danger before colliding at slow speed with the leading coach of the approaching 15.57 Scarborough - Leeds Class 101. Both drivers and twelve passengers were injured.
* On 11 July 1967, A 101 working on the 10.11 Chester to Manchester Exchange service collided at a speed of approx. 20 mph with the rear of the 02.00 Margam to Carlisle Class 5 freight train which was standing at the Winwick Junction Down Fast Home signal. There were no injuries.
* On 16 February 1977, an express passenger train hauled by Class 55 locomotive 55 008 collided with a Class 101 diesel multiple unit operating an empty stock train after failing to stop at . One of the vehicles of the DMU overturned. The guard of the express was slightly injured. The cause of the accident was that the brakes on the carriages of the express had become isolated whilst the train was moving in a freak event. The train had struck an object on the track, which had caused a traction motor cover to come loose. This struck the handle of the brake isolating cock, closing it and thus separating the brakes between the locomotive and train.
* On 28 March 1983, the 20.58 Falkirk Grahamston to Glasgow Queen St. service collided with a van that was allowed to roll away and drop 40 feet into the cutting near Eastfield shed.

==Original TOPS classes==
When TOPS was originally introduced only the Driving Motor Brake Second (DMBS) and the Driving Motor Composite (with Lavatory) (DMCL) were classified as Class 101 (AEC engines) or Class 102 (Leyland engines). The Driving Trailer Composite (with Lavatory) (DTCL) were either Class 144 or Class 147. The Trailer Seconds (with Lavatory) (TSL) were Class 162, the Trailer Brake Second (with Lavatory) (TBSL) were Class 168 and the Trailer Composite (with Lavatory) (TCL) were Class 171.
Later all the cars were reclassified, becoming Class 101.

==Preservation==
The Class 101 was one of the largest classes of first-generation DMUs and, partly thanks to their relatively late withdrawal from revenue-earning service, numerous vehicles have been preserved on heritage railways, including the Great Central Railway and the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. There are only three centre cars preserved: at the Severn Valley Railway, North Yorkshire Moors Railway and Mid-Norfolk Railway. No Trailer Brake Seconds were preserved.

== Model railways ==
Hornby Railways first produced a version of the BR Class 101 in OO gauge in 1958 which was last produced in 1977. Lima also produced a Class 101 for a number of years, in Green, Blue/Grey, Regional Railways and Network Southeast liveries. The tooling was used by Hornby following purchase of their assets. In 2007, Hornby reintroduced the Lima version of the OO gauge Class 101 in BR green and BR blue liveries. Bachmann Industries launched their BR Class 101 in OO gauge in 2014 and this has also been produced in a variety of liveries

==In fiction==
The Class 101 DMUs were the basis for the character Daisy the Diesel Railcar in The Railway Series books written by the Rev. W. Awdry, and the adapted television series Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, although Daisy is a single car. 101685 on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway is named after her.

<doc id="1095495" wikidata="Q663120" url="?curid=1095495" title="Southern Railway (U.S.)">
<text>The Southern Railway (also known as Southern Railway Company; ) was a class 1 railroad based in the Southern United States between 1894 and 1982, at which time it merged with the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W) to form the Norfolk Southern Railway. The railroad was the product of nearly 150 predecessor lines that were combined, reorganized and recombined beginning in the 1830s, formally becoming the Southern Railway in 1894.

At the end of 1971, the Southern operated of railroad, not including its Class I subsidiaries Alabama Great Southern (528 miles or ); Central of Georgia (1729 miles); Savannah &amp; Atlanta (167 miles); Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway (415 miles); Georgia Southern &amp; Florida (454 miles); and twelve Class II subsidiaries. That year, the Southern itself reported 26,111 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 110 million passenger-miles. Alabama Great Southern reported 3,854 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 11 million passenger-miles; Central of Georgia 3,595 and 17; Savannah &amp; Atlanta 140 and 0; Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway 4906 and 0.3; and Georgia Southern &amp; Florida 1,431 and 0.3.

The railroad joined forces with the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1980 to form the Norfolk Southern Corporation. The Norfolk Southern Corporation was created in response to the creation of the rival CSX Corporation by a number of railroads in the eastern United States (adopting the name CSX Transportation for its rail system in 1986). Southern and N&amp;W continued as operating companies of Norfolk Southern until in 1982, when Norfolk Southern merged nearly all of N&amp;W&#x27;s operations into Southern to form the Norfolk Southern Railway. The railroad has used that name since.

== History ==
=== Official predecessors ===
* Richmond, York River and Chesapeake Railroad (1894)
* Richmond and Danville Railroad (1894)
* Memphis and Charleston Railroad (1894)
* East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway (1894)
* Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway (1894)

=== Creation and independent status ===

The pioneering South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company, Southern&#x27;s earliest predecessor line and one of the first railroads in the United States, was chartered on December 19, 1827, and ran the nation&#x27;s first regularly scheduled steam-powered passenger train – the wood-burning &quot;Best Friend of Charleston&quot; – over a six-mile section out of Charleston, South Carolina, on December 25, 1830. By October 1833, its 136-mile line to Hamburg, South Carolina, was the longest in the world. The company leased enslaved African Americans from plantation owners when free white people refused to work in the swamps. The company eventually purchased 89 people to work as slaves.

As railroad fever struck other Southern states, networks gradually spread across the South and even across the Appalachian Mountains. By 1857, the Memphis and Charleston Railroad was completed to link both Charleston, South Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee. The Western North Carolina Railroad was halted because voters were angry about that law allowed purchasers of private bonds to have the train tracks veer to their towns. The provision of the laws that allowed this was not repealed until Reconstruction.

Rail expansion in the South was also halted with the start of the Civil War. The Battle of Shiloh, the Siege of Corinth and the Second Battle of Corinth in 1862 were motivated by the importance of the Memphis and Charleston line, the only east–west rail link across the Confederacy. The Chickamauga Campaign for Chattanooga, Tennessee, was also motivated by the importance of its rail connections to the Memphis and Charleston and other lines. Also, in 1862, the Richmond and York River Railroad, which operated from the Pamunkey River at West Point, Virginia, to Richmond, Virginia, was a major focus of George McClellan&#x27;s Peninsular Campaign, which culminated in the Seven Days Battles and devastated the tiny rail link. Late in the war, the Richmond and Danville Railroad was the Confederacy&#x27;s last link to Richmond, and transported Jefferson Davis and his cabinet to Danville, Virginia, just before the fall of Richmond in April 1865.

Known as the &quot;First Railroad War&quot;, the Civil War left the South&#x27;s railroads and economy devastated. Most of the railroads, however, were repaired, reorganized and operated again. Convict lease was a near continuation of slavery as charges were often only applied to people of African descent. Five-hundred African Americans were assigned to provide backbreaking labor on the Western North Carolina Railroad. Men were shipped to and from the worksite in iron shackles and around twenty were drowned in the Tuckasegee River weighted down by their shackles. In the area along the Ohio River and Mississippi River, construction of new railroads continued throughout Reconstruction. The Richmond and Danville System expanded throughout the South during this period, but was overextended, and came upon financial troubles in 1893, when control was lost to financier J. P. Morgan, who reorganized it into the Southern Railway System.

Southern Railway came into existence in 1894 through the combination of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, the Richmond and Danville system and the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad. The company owned two-thirds of the 4,400 miles of line it operated, and the rest was held through leases, operating agreements and stock ownership. Southern also controlled the Alabama Great Southern and the Georgia Southern and Florida, which operated separately, and it had an interest in the Central of Georgia. Additionally, the Southern Railway also agreed to lease the North Carolina Railroad Company, providing a critical connection from Virginia to the rest of the southeast via the Carolinas.

Southern&#x27;s first president, Samuel Spencer, brought more lines into Southern&#x27;s organized system. During his 12-year term, the railway built new shops at Spencer, North Carolina, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia, upgraded tracks, and purchased more equipment. He moved the company&#x27;s service away from an agricultural dependence on tobacco and cotton and centered its efforts on diversifying traffic and industrial development. On November 29, 1906, Spencer was killed in a train wreck.

After the line from Meridian, Mississippi, to New Orleans, Louisiana, was acquired in 1916 under Southern&#x27;s president Fairfax Harrison, the railroad had assembled the 8,000-mile, 13-state system that lasted for almost half a century. Additionally, Southern have operated 6,791 miles of road at the end of 1925, but its flock of subsidiaries added 1000+ more.

In 1912, the Southern Railway leased most of its Bluemont, Virginia, branch to the newly formed Washington and Old Dominion Railway. In 1945, the Southern sold most of the remnant of the branch to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, the successor to the Washington and Old Dominion Railway.

The Central of Georgia became part of the system in 1963, and the former Norfolk Southern Railway was acquired in 1974. Despite these small acquisitions, the Southern disdained the merger trend when it swept the railroad industry in the 1960s, choosing to remain a regional carrier. In 1978 President L. Stanley Crane said the refusal to add routes through merger was a mistake, especially the decision not to add a connecting route to Chicago.

The Southern tried to gain access to Chicago by targeting the Monon Railroad and the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad but both those railroads went to Southern&#x27;s competitor, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. A decade later Crane tried to rectify the situation by merging with the Illinois Central Railroad. When that failed, he petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to give Southern the old Monon routes and the old Atlantic Coast Line route from Jacksonville to Tampa by way of Orlando among other properties as a condition of the I.C.C.&#x27;s approval of the Seaboard Coast Line – Chessie System merger in 1979. While the request was supported by the I.C.C.&#x27;s Enforcement Bureau, it was ultimately unsuccessful.

=== Becoming part of the Norfolk Southern Corporation ===
In response to the creation of the CSX Corporation in November 1980, the Southern Railway joined forces with the Norfolk and Western Railway and formed the Norfolk Southern Corporation in 1980 which began operations in 1982, further consolidating railroads in the eastern half of the United States.

The Southern Railway was renamed Norfolk Southern Railway as the Norfolk and Western Railway became a subsidiary to its system on June 1, 1982. The railroad then acquired more than half of Conrail on June 1, 1999.

== Notable features ==
Southern and its predecessors were responsible for many firsts in the industry. Starting in 1833, its predecessor, the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road, was the first to carry passengers, U.S. troops and mail on steam-powered trains and experimented with railroad lighting. They had a pine log fire on a flatcar, covered in sand, to provide light at night before inexpensive kerosene was invented for lamps.

The Southern operated some of the largest heavy repair shops of any US southeastern railroad. The oldest shops were located in Knoxville, Tennessee, first built in 1855. In 1890 they were relocated to the northwest side of the city and renamed Coster. The 1850s-era Atlanta, Georgia shops were moved to the south side of the city in 1883. These were originally called South Shops but later renamed to Pegram. In 1907 a new terminal with medium repair capabilities was added to the north side of Atlanta. The modern and complete Spencer Shops, located 2.5 miles north of Salisbury, North Carolina, were opened in 1896. Another new shop site was established on the north side of Birmingham, Alabama near the Findley Yard in 1924, taking the place of two obsolete facilities. The Princeton, Indiana shops were built in 1890. After the railroad switched to diesel power, the primary repair shops were consolidated to Spencer and Pegram.

The Southern Railway began dieselization in 1941, and was the largest all-diesel railroad when it retired its last steam locomotive in 1953. The Southern Railway was active in mechanization, used helper engines, is widely credited with inventing unit trains for coal and new freight cars, and understood the power of marketing using the promotional phrase &quot;Southern Gives a Green Light to Innovation&quot;.

In 1966, a popular steam locomotive excursion program was instituted under the presidency of W. Graham Claytor Jr., and included Southern veteran locomotives No. 630, No. 722, No. 4501, and Savannah &amp; Atlanta No. 750 along with non-Southern locomotives such as Texas &amp; Pacific No. 610, Canadian Pacific No. 2839, and Chesapeake &amp; Ohio No. 2716. The steam program continued after the 1982 merger with the Norfolk and Western to form the Norfolk Southern, though increased operating costs and concerns ended the program in 1994. Norfolk Southern reinstated the steam program on a limited basis from 2011 to 2015, as the 21st Century Steam program.

In the early 2000s, a loop of former Southern Railway right-of-way encircling central Atlanta neighborhoods was acquired and is now the BeltLine trail.

== Passenger trains ==
Along with its famed &quot;Crescent&quot; and &quot;Southerner&quot;, the Southern&#x27;s other named passenger trains included:
* &quot;Aiken-Augusta Special&quot;
* &quot;Airline Belle&quot;
* &quot;Asheville Special&quot;
* &quot;Birmingham Special&quot;
* &quot;Carolina Special&quot;
* &quot;Fast Mail &quot;Old 97&quot;&quot;
* &quot;Florida Sunbeam&quot;
* &quot;Goldenrod&quot;
* &quot;Kansas City–Florida Special&quot;
* &quot;Land of the Sky Special&quot;
* &quot;Memphis Special&quot;
* &quot;New Yorker&quot;
* &quot;Peach Queen&quot;
* &quot;Pelican&quot;
* &quot;Piedmont Limited&quot;
* &quot;Ponce de Leon&quot;
* &quot;Queen and Crescent Limited&quot;
* &quot;Royal Palm&quot;
* &quot;Skyland Special&quot;
* &quot;Sunnyland&quot;
* &quot;Tennessean&quot;

The Southern Railway also handled ticket sales and operations for subsidiary railroads, such as:
* &quot;The Nancy Hanks&quot; (operated by Central of Georgia Railway)
* &quot;The Man O&#x27; War&quot; (operated by Central of Georgia Railway)

The Southern Railway also participated in the operation of the &quot;City of Miami&quot;, which was operated by the Southern Railway over the Central of Georgia trackage from Birmingham, Alabama, to Albany, Georgia, where it traded off with the Seaboard Coast Line until its discontinuation in 1971.

When Amtrak took over most intercity rail service in 1971, Southern initially opted out of turning over its passenger routes to the new organization. However, it shared operation of its flagship train, the New Orleans–New York &quot;Southern Crescent&quot;, with Amtrak. Under a longstanding haulage agreement inherited from Penn Central and the Pennsylvania Railroad, Amtrak carried the train north of Washington. By the late 1970s, growing revenue losses and equipment-replacement expenses convinced Southern it could not continue in the passenger business. It handed full control of its passenger routes to Amtrak in 1979.

<doc id="1095523" wikidata="Q4719176" url="?curid=1095523" title="Alexander Hume">
<text>Alexander Hume (1558 – 4 December 1609) was a Scottish poet who served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in the early 17th century.

==Life==
He was born in 1558 the son of Patrick Hume (d.1599).

The brother of Patrick Hume of Polwarth, he was educated at the University of St. Andrews graduating in 1574 then studied Civil Law in Paris. He returned to Scotland in 1578 serving in the Court of Justice, but (ironically) found it too corrupt for his tastes and decided instead to devote himself to the service of the church, and became minister of Logie Kirk in Stirlingshire in 1597. This appears to have been at least partly supported by Alexander Home of North Berwick, Provost of Edinburgh. His stipend (or at least the bulk of it) appears to have been paid by his own father rather than by the church.

His manse stood to the west of the church in the grounds of Airthrey Castle and dated from 1590.

He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland &quot;several times&quot;: thought to be 1602, 1604 and 1607 (possibly also 1599).

On 6 May 1608 he was attacked by a parishioner (possibly his brother in-law), James Duncanson, with a heavy staff and never recovered. Duncanson is probably the same James Duncanson mentioned in parish records of April 1595 for having &quot;carnal deal together&quot; with Agnes Forester of Stirling, where the church forced them to marry.

Hume grew ill in May 1609 and died on 4 December of that year.

In his will he left a considerable number of books plus several musical instruments. To his best friend John Scherar a baillie in Stirling he left a gold ring to remember his &quot;special love&quot;. He left his &quot;love and Christian affection&quot; to Dame Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar, the poet Lady Elizabeth Melvil, Lady Comrie, John Gillespie minister of Alva, Ninian Drummond minister of Dunblane, William Stirling minister of Port of Menteith, John Alison minister of Kincardine, William Nairn minister of Kippen and James Caldwell minister of Bothkennar.

His position at Logie Kirk was filled by Rev James Saittone or Seytoun of Denny before the end of the year.

==Works==

He published in 1599 &quot;Hymnes, or Sacred Songs&quot;, including &quot;The Day Estival&quot; descriptive of a summer day. Other works included the following:
* &quot;Thanks for the Deliverance of the Sicke&quot;
* &quot;Ane Epistle to Maister Gilbert Montcrief&quot;

==Family==
His sister Janet Hume married Lord David Hume of Law.

He was married to Marion Duncanson, daughter of John Duncanson (1501–1601) Principal of St Leonard&#x27;s College in St Andrews, and later Dean of the Chapel Royal in Stirling. They had two daughters, Dinah and Naomi, and one son Caleb Hume, and they lived together in Logie manse. The family were asked to leave the manse in June 1610 to accommodate the new minister but were compensated £60.

His great nephew was Patrick Hume, 1st Earl of Marchmont.

<doc id="1095529" wikidata="Q8012681" url="?curid=1095529" title="William Hunnis">
<text>William Hunnis (died 6 June 1597) was an English Protestant poet, dramatist, and composer.

==Biography==

Hunnis was as early as 1549 in the service of William Herbert, later Earl of Pembroke. His friend Thomas Newton, in a poem prefixed to &quot;The Hive of Hunnye&quot; (1578), says: &quot;In prime of youth thy pleasant Penne depaincted Sonets sweete&quot;, and mentions his interludes, gallant lays, rondelets and songs, explaining that it was in the winter of his age that he turned to sacred lore and high philosophy.

In 1550 he published &quot;Certayne Psalms ... in Englishe metre&quot;, and shortly afterward was made a gentleman of the Chapel Royal to Edward VI. At Mary I&#x27;s accession he retained his appointment, but in 1555 he is said to have been one of a party of twelve conspirators who had determined to take Mary&#x27;s life.

Although nothing came of the first plot, shortly afterward he was party to the Dudley conspiracy to dethrone Mary in favour of her sister Elizabeth. Hunnis, having some knowledge of alchemy, was to go abroad to coin the necessary gold, but this doubtful mission was exchanged for the task of making false keys to the treasury in London, which he was able to do because of his friendship with Nicholas Brigham, the receiver of the exchequer. The conspirators were betrayed by one of their number, Thomas Whyte. Some were executed, and Hunnis was imprisoned.

The death of Mary made him a free man, and in 1559 he married Margaret, Brigham&#x27;s widow, but she died within the year, and Hunnis married in 1560 the widow of a grocer. He himself
became a grocer and freeman of the City of London, and supervisor of the Queen&#x27;s Gardens at Greenwich. In 1566 he was made Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal. No complete
piece of his is extant, perhaps because of the rule that the plays acted by the Children should not have been previously printed.

In his later years he purchased land at Barking, Essex. If the lines above his signature on a 1557 edition of Sir Thomas More&#x27;s works are genuine, he remained a poor man, for he refuses to make
a will on the ground that &quot;the good that I shall leave, will not pay all I owe&quot;. In British Library Harley MS 6403 is a story that one of his sons, in the capacity of page, drank the remainder of the poisoned cup supposed to have been provided by Leicester for Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, but escaped with no injury beyond the loss of his hair.

==Works==
Hunnis&#x27;s extant works include:
*&quot;Certayne Psalms&quot; (1549), 
*&quot;A Hive full of Hunnye&quot; (1578), 
*&quot;Seven Sobbes of a sorrowful Soule for Sinne&quot; (1583),
*&quot;Hunnies Recreations&quot; (1588),
*sixteen poems in the &quot;Paradise of Dainty Devices&quot; (1576), 
*and two in &quot;England&#x27;s Helicon&quot; (1600).

His most famous musical compositions are found in a compilation, &quot;Seven Sobs of a Sorrowfull Soule for Sinne&quot;, which includes &quot;A Handful of Honisuckles&quot;. Those parts of the compilation which are musical are in a devotional style, and all his music in that collection consists of single-line tunes. Some of his work is for solo voice and viols, for example a setting of his own poem &quot;In terrors trapp&#x27;d&quot;.

<doc id="1095535" wikidata="Q6698372" url="?curid=1095535" title="Lucy Hutchinson">
<text>Lucy Hutchinson (; 29 January 1620 – October 1681) was an English translator, poet, and biographer, and the first person to translate the complete text of Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;De rerum natura&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;) into English verse, during the years of the Interregnum (1649–1660).

==Biography==
Lucy Apsley was born on 29 January 1620 in the Tower of London, where her father, Sir Allen Apsley, was Lieutenant. She was named after her mother, Lady Lucy St John, and was the second of ten children. 

Lucy was married on 3 July 1638 in St. Andrew Holborn to Colonel John Hutchinson (1615–1664). She claimed that he was in part attracted to her intellectual and poetic accomplishments. In 1649, John Hutchinson was one of the signatories of King Charles&#x27;s death-warrant, but he later protested against the assumption of supreme power by Oliver Cromwell.

After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, her husband was arrested for his part in the regicide and imprisoned in Sandown Castle, Kent. However, he was not tried. Lucy went before the House of Lords to gain his release, but to no avail. In 1664, John Hutchinson died in prison. His death deeply affected her and her writing, as attested by her &quot;Elegies&quot; series of poems.

Lucy was an ardent Puritan, and she held fast to her Calvinist convictions. She died at Owthorpe in October 1681, and was buried in her husband&#x27;s tomb.

==Literary works==
Lucy Hutchinson has a place in literary history for her biography of her husband, &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson,&quot; in addition to her works in poetry and translation. 

===Biography===
&quot;Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson&quot; throws light upon the characteristics and conditions of the life of Puritans during the English Civil War. Intended for her family only, it was printed by a descendant in 1806, and became a popular and influential account of that period. In the book, she records that John Hutchinson had many notable victories in the Civil War, including at Shelford Manor on 27 October 1645. In this battle he defeated his kinsman, Colonel Philip Stanhope, the fifth son of the 1st Earl of Chesterfield. Lucy may have even seen the battle, as their estate of Owthorpe in Nottinghamshire was only a few miles away.

===Translation===
Lucy Hutchinson is the first named translator of the full text of Lucretius&#x27;s &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot; into English verse. She is likely to have begun her translation during the 1650s. In 1675 she dedicated a manuscript copy of the translation to acquaintance and literary patron Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey, repudiating the work and declaring it to be in conflict with her Puritan values. This manuscript was sold to the British Library by his heirs in 1853; however, it did not at first attract much attention. Her title as first English translator of the &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot; is challenged by an anonymous manuscript prose translation, likely of the same decade, now preserved at Oxford (Bodleian MS Rawl. D.314). Hutchinson&#x27;s translation was published for the first time in 1996 under the editorship of Hugh de Quehen. It was republished in a comprehensive edition by Oxford University Press in 2018.

===Poetry===
A series of original poems by Hutchinson was re-discovered in a manuscript in the Nottinghamshire Archives (DD/Hu 2) by David Norbrook. This work is likely contemporaneous in composition with the &quot;Memoirs&quot;. This manuscript, referred to as the &quot;Elegies&quot;, contains 23 numbered poems. Throughout her poems, Hutchinson lamented her husband&#x27;s death, honoured his life, and moved toward an acceptance of his death, while commenting on the English political structure following the Restoration. These poems were unpublished in her lifetime and the manuscript, which is not in her hand, has no dedication.

Hutchinson&#x27;s other works included &quot;Order and Disorder,&quot; arguably the first epic poem written by a woman in the English language. The work is a verse paraphrase of the Book of Genesis, offering parallels to John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Only five cantos of the work were published during her lifetime, in 1679. The work was posthumously published in 1817. In 2001 the critic David Norbrook published the work in full; he considers it to have been written after the translation of &quot;De rerum natura&quot; and roughly parallel to when Milton is thought to have written &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1660–1664). Hutchinson also wrote &quot;On the Principles of the Christian Religion&quot;, an articulation of the Puritan beliefs of herself and her husband. It was dedicated to her daughter Barbara and likely intended as a work of religious instruction.

===Other works===
Amongst her other religious writings is a translation of Congregationalist divine John Owen&#x27;s work &quot;Theologoumena pantodoupa&quot;.

==Family==
John and Lucy Hutchinson had nine children.

<doc id="1095537" wikidata="Q5052528" url="?curid=1095537" title="Catherine Austin Fitts">
<text>Catherine Austin Fitts (born December 24, 1950) is an American investment banker and former public official who served as managing director of Dillon, Read &amp; Co. and, during the Presidency of George H.W. Bush, as United States Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Housing. She has widely written and commented on the subject of public spending and has alleged several large-scale instances of government fraud.

==Early life and education==
Catherine Austin Fitts was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She earned an AA degree from Bennett College in 1970 and a BA degree in history from the University of Pennsylvania in 1974. After graduating, she briefly worked as a bartender until one of her customers, who was director of admissions at the Wharton School, encouraged her to pursue graduate studies. She received her MBA from Wharton in 1978.

==Career==
===Dillon, Read &amp; Co.===
After graduate school, Fitts went to work at Dillon, Read &amp; Co. While there, in 1982, she organized a novel municipal bond sale to raise several billion dollars to revitalize the New York Subway System, marking the first time that a public agency had sold bonds backed by rider fares. In 1986, Fitts became the first woman promoted to managing director of Dillon, Read &amp; Co. in the investment bank&#x27;s then 156 year history. During her time as managing director, &quot;Businessweek&quot; described Fitts as &quot;Wall Street&#x27;s foremost champion&quot; of public utilities bonds.

===U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)===
During the 1988 United States presidential election, Fitts worked on the campaign of George H. W. Bush and was appointed as Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Housing in the Bush administration, where she was charged with repairing the department&#x27;s reputation in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis. Among her initial observations upon taking office was that the department had a $300 billion portfolio of mortgage insurance but only employed one certified actuary. The reforms she announced included a plan to sell government-foreclosed homes at a 50-percent discount to non-profit organizations to operate as rentals. Previously, the government had sought to sell residential properties at the highest possible value, which resulted in a glut of real estate in its portfolio that had to be managed at great expense, as well as in shortages of housing stock in some high-density markets.

She resigned her post in 1990, following a report that her relationship with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp had soured, a report Kemp denied. Fitts&#x27; departure prompted criticism of Kemp; she had been – according to Neal Peirce – &quot;widely regarded as the best manager he brought in&quot;.

According to Fitts, she was offered an appointment to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors after her departure from HUD but declined, preferring to return to the private sector instead.

===Hamilton Securities and Solari===
After leaving government, Fitts founded Hamilton Securities, an employee-owned brokerage house, which she ran until 1998. In 1993, Hamilton Securities won a contract with HUD to manage its $500 billion investment portfolio. While managing HUD&#x27;s portfolio, Fitts devised a location-based mortgage debt resale software program that may have resulted in an increase in department revenue of several hundreds of millions of dollars.

In 1997, HUD canceled the Hamilton contract over what it claimed were accounting errors involving the program; an investigation into Hamilton Securities was launched by the HUD Inspector-General, the FBI, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to Fitts, the investigation was undertaken as retribution against her; she claimed that Community Wizard data revealed that some federally-guaranteed mortgage securities may have been fraudulently issued. One outside complainant, a government contractor, charged insider dealing and bid rigging in its contention that Hamilton Securities had obtained its HUD business due to favoritism. In 2002 the investigation was closed, and investigators stated they had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Fitts or Hamilton Securities.

Fitts was a member of the Global Business Network&#x27;s &quot;Worldview&quot; from 1996-1997, and served on the advisory board for The Arlington Institute from June 1998 to June 2000.

===Writing and commentary===
Fitts has researched and commented on government spending. In a 2004 study published in &quot;World Affairs: The Journal of International Issues&quot;, she purported to find &quot;evidence that a very large proportion of the nation&#x27;s wealth is being illegally diverted since several decades into secret, unaccountable channels and programmes with unspecified purposes, including covert operations and subversions abroad and clandestine military R&amp;D at home. Public institutions have been infiltrated and taken over by shadowy groups in the service of powerful private and vested interests, often at the expense of the common good.&quot;

In 2017 Fitts co-authored a report, with Michigan State University economist Mark Skidmore, that claimed to find $21 trillion in &quot;unauthorized spending&quot; by the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development over a 17-year period.

Fitts has claimed that HUD&#x27;s mission of spurring economic growth is secondary to what she contends is its use as a fundraising mechanism for military and intelligence agencies involving a complex securities scheme using HUD-backed Ginnie Mae investments. According to Fitts, HUD overpays to rehabilitate public housing and funnels the difference into unaudited black budget programs at the behest of national security agencies.

During the United States presidential election, 2016, Fitts supported the campaign of Donald Trump. On December 8, 2020, Trump retweeted one of Fitts&#x27; tweets which linked to an article on Breitbart. She has donated to political campaigns of Democrats Cynthia McKinney and Marcy Kaptur, and Republicans Rand Paul and Thomas Massie.

She has given interviews in alternate media, such as kla.tv, alleging fraud in the US central banking system and US government (&quot;21 trillion dollars have been stolen&quot;) and &quot;massive fraud&quot; in the 2020 election and Electoral fraud in US elections for many years before 2020.

<text>Elizabeth Inchbald (née Simpson, 15 October 1753 – 1 August 1821) was an English novelist, actress, dramatist, and translator. Her two novels, &quot;A Simple Story&quot; and &quot;Nature and Art&quot;, have received particular critical attention.

==Life==

Born on 15 October 1753 at Stanningfield, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Elizabeth was the eighth of the nine children of Mary Simpson (&quot;née&quot; Rushbrook) and her husband John Simpson (died 1761), a farmer. The family, like several others in the neighbourhood, was Roman Catholic. Her brother was sent to school, but Elizabeth and her sisters were educated at home.

Inchbald had a speech impediment. Focused on acting from a young age, she worked hard to manage her stammer, but her family discouraged an attempt in early 1770 to gain a position at the Norwich Theatre. That same year her brother George became an actor. Still determined, Inchbald went to London to become an actress in April 1772 at the age of 18. 

It was a difficult beginning: some observers thought her stammer affected her performance and the audience&#x27;s reaction. Furthermore, young and alone, she later described having to defend herself from the sexual advances of stage manager James Dodd and theatre manager John Taylor. Two months after her arrival in London, in June, she agreed to marry a fellow Catholic, actor Joseph Inchbald (1735–1779), possibly at least in part for protection. Joseph at that time was not well-known, was twice Elizabeth&#x27;s age, and had two illegitimate sons. The couple did not have children together and the marriage is believed to have had difficulties. The Inchbalds appeared on the stage together for the first time on 4 September 1772 in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear.&quot; In October 1772, the couple began a demanding tour in Scotland with West Digges&#x27;s theatre company that continued for almost four years. In 1776, they moved to France in order for Joseph to learn to paint and Elizabeth to study French. However, they were penniless within a month. They returned to Britain and moved to Liverpool where Inchbald, after joining Joseph Younger&#x27;s company, met actors Sarah Siddons and her brother John Philip Kemble, both of whom became important friends. The Inchbalds later moved to Canterbury and Yorkshire and in 1777 were hired by Tate Wilkinson&#x27;s company.

After Joseph Inchbald&#x27;s sudden death in June 1779, Inchbald continued to act for several years, in Dublin, London, and elsewhere. Her acting career, only moderately successful, spanned seventeen years. She appeared in many classical roles and in new plays such as Hannah Cowley&#x27;s &quot;The Belle&#x27;s Stratagem&quot;.

She died on 1 August 1821 in Kensington and is buried in the churchyard of St Mary Abbots. Her gravestone calls her one &quot;whose writings will be cherished while truth, simplicity, and feelings, command public admiration.&quot; In 1833, a two-volume &quot;Memoirs of Mrs. Inchbald&quot; by James Boaden was published by Richard Bentley.

==Written work==

While relatively unknown as an actress, after her husband&#x27;s death Inchbald went on to become a celebrated playwright and author. Her success as a writer meant she did not need a spouse&#x27;s financial support, and she did not remarry. Her literary career began with pieces in &quot;The Artist&quot; and the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. Between 1784 and 1805, nineteen of her comedies, sentimental dramas, and farces, many of them translations from French or German originals, were performed in London theatres. Her first play to be produced was &quot;A Mogul Tale,&quot; with her in the lead female role of Selina. In 1780, she joined the Covent Garden Company and played the breeches role of Bellario in &quot;Philaster&quot;. Her plays were also produced at the Haymarket Theatre. She wrote between twenty-one and twenty-three plays — the exact number is disputed — and eighteen were published.

She is probably best known in the twenty-first century for her two novels, &quot;A Simple Story&quot; (1791) and &quot;Nature and Art&quot; (1796). A political radical and friend of William Godwin and Thomas Holcroft, her beliefs are clearer in her novels than in her plays, due to constrictions on the patent theatres of Georgian London, though even there she took risks. &quot;Inchbald&#x27;s life was marked by tensions between, on the one hand, political radicalism, a passionate nature evidently attractive to a number of her admirers, and a love of independence, and on the other hand, a desire for social respectability and a strong sense of the emotional attraction of authority figures.&quot; One critic describes the complexity of her writing as &quot;richly textured with strands of resistance, boldness, and libidinal thrills&quot;. An example of this contradictory impulse may be seen in her biography when, despite their shared political beliefs, she quarrelled publicly with Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797, when Wollstonecraft&#x27;s marriage to William Godwin made it clear that she had not been married to Gilbert Imlay, the father of her elder daughter Fanny. This incident was deeply resented by Godwin.

She also did considerable editorial and critical work. A four-volume autobiography was destroyed before her death on the advice of her confessor, but she left some of her diaries. The latter are held at the Folger Shakespeare Library and an edition was published in 2007.

==Reception and reputation==
Many of the plays she translated were farces, and they were popular with audiences. Over a period of twenty years, she translated one or two pieces a year, one notable example being &quot;Lovers&#x27; Vows&quot;, a translation of a play by August von Kotzebues. &quot;Lovers&#x27; Vows&quot; ran for forty-two nights when first performed in 1798: a highly successful run. &quot;Lovers&#x27; Vows&quot; (1798) was subsequently featured as a focus of moral controversy by Jane Austen in her novel &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1814).

Inchbald&#x27;s novels, in particular &quot;A Simple Story&quot;, were well reviewed. However, her theatrical reviews were sometimes received poorly by other critics.

While in the 1920s she was described by one critic as &quot;a charming woman&quot; who was sadly ignorant of Shakespeare, in recent decades Inchbald has aroused considerable critical interest, particularly among scholars of women&#x27;s writing. Her two novels have been frequently reprinted and American critic Terry Castle called her &quot;A Simple Story&quot; &quot;the most elegant English fiction of the eighteenth century&quot;.

<text>The Chien Français Blanc et Noir (translated into English as the French White and Black dog) is a breed of dog of the scenthound type, originating in France. The breed is used for hunting in packs and descends from the old Hound of Saintonge type of large hunting dog.

== Appearance ==
The breed is a typical hunting pack hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, slightly domed head, long drop ears, and slightly square flews that just overlap the lower lip. Size is at the withers, females slightly smaller.

The colour of the coat is white and black, with a black mantle, sometimes speckled or ticked with black or blue. Pale tan dots are above each eye as well as tan on the cheeks, below the eyes and ears, and below the tail. Sometimes a tan marking is found on the base of the upper thigh, which is called the &#x27;roe buck mark&#x27;. Faults are listed as deviations in appearance that have an effect on the health and working ability of the dog, as well as indication of crossing with Foxhounds or being off-colour, indicating that a dog with such faults should not be bred.

The breed is noted for its perseverance on the hunt as well as a good nose and voice. Unusual for pack hounds, it is friendly and easy for humans to manage.

== History ==
The breed&#x27;s ancestry was in the old Hound of Saintonge, which almost disappeared during the French Revolution, through the Gascon Saintongeois breed created by Count Joseph de Carayon-Latour in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark/Brace&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Gascon Saintongeois hounds were crossbred with the Poitevin in the late 19th century to produce the Chien Français Blanc et Noir. The dogs were officially recognised as a breed in 1957. In 2009, there were approximately 2000 of the breed registered through the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

The Chien Français Blanc et Noir are pack hunting hounds, which means that groups hunt together in packs, always directed by a human, not running about hunting by themselves. The Chien Français Blanc et Noir packs are especially valued in the hunting of red deer or roe deer. Their attractiveness and deep howl has made them an increasingly popular pet in the United States.

<text>Marzabotto (Medial Mountain Bolognese: ) is a small town and &quot;comune&quot; in Italian region Emilia-Romagna, part of the Metropolitan City of Bologna. It is located south-southwest of Bologna by rail, and lies in the valley of the Reno. The area includes the site of an ancient Etruscan city and also the place of a modern massacre that took place there during World War II.

==Etruscan city==

In and below the grounds of the Villa Aria, close to the city, are the remains of an Etruscan town of the 5th century BC, Kainua, protected on the west by the mountains, on the south-east by the river, which by a change of course has destroyed about half of it. The acropolis was just below the villa: here remains of temples were found.

The town lay below the modern high-road and was laid out on a rectangular plan divided by main streets into eight quarters, and these in turn into blocks or insulae. Necropoleis were found on the east and north of the site. The place was partially inhabited later by the Gauls, but was not occupied by the Romans.
==World War II massacre==
On September 29, 1944, during the World War II German occupation of Italy, the town was the site of the worst massacre of civilians committed by the Waffen SS in Italy. In reprisal of the local support given to the partisans and the resistance movement, soldiers of the SS-Panzer-Aufklärungsabteilung 16, killed systematically hundreds of civilians in Marzabotto, and in the adjacent Grizzana Morandi and Monzuno.
The town was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour for this episode.
Sculptor Nicola Zamboni created a large monument in the city in 1975 in front of the town hall.

<doc id="1095547" wikidata="Q3027624" url="?curid=1095547" title="Hashlife">
<text>Hashlife is a memoized algorithm for computing the long-term fate of a given starting configuration in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life and related cellular automata, much more quickly than would be possible using alternative algorithms that simulate each time step of each cell of the automaton. The algorithm was first described by Bill Gosper in the early 1980s while he was engaged in research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. Hashlife was originally implemented on Symbolics Lisp machines with the aid of the Flavors extension.

==Hashlife==
Hashlife is designed to exploit large amounts of spatial and temporal redundancy in most Life rules. For example, in Conway&#x27;s Life, many seemingly random patterns end up as collections of simple still lifes and oscillators. Hashlife does however not depend on patterns remaining in the same position; it is more about exploiting that large patterns tend to have subpatterns that appear in several places, possibly at different times.

===Representation===
The field is typically treated as a theoretically infinite grid, with the pattern in question centered near the origin. A quadtree (with sharing of nodes) is used to represent the field. A node at the &quot;k&quot;th level of the tree represents a square of 22&quot;k&quot; cells, 2&quot;k&quot; on a side, by referencing the four &quot;k&quot;–1 level nodes that represent the four formula_1 quadrants of that level &quot;k&quot; square. For example, a level 3 node represents an 8×8 square, which decomposes into four 4×4 squares. Explicit cell contents are only stored at level 0. The root node has to be at a high enough level that all live cells are found within the square it represents.

While a quadtree naively seems to require far more overhead than simpler representations (such as using a matrix of bits), it allows for various optimizations. Since each cell is either live or dead, there are only two possibilities for a node at level 0, so if nodes are allowed to be shared between parents, there is never a need for having more than 2 level 0 nodes in total. Likewise the 4 cells of a 2×2 square can only exhibit formula_2 different combinations, so no more than that many level 1 nodes are needed either. Going to higher levels, the number of possible &quot;k&quot;th level squares grows as formula_3, but the number of distinct &quot;k&quot;th level squares occurring in any particular run is much lower, and very often the same square contents appears in several places. For maximal sharing of nodes in the quadtree (which is not so much a tree as a directed acyclic graph), we only want to use one node to represent all squares with the same content.

===Hashing===
A hash table, or more generally any kind of associative array, may be used to map square contents to an already existing node representing those contents, so that one through the technique of hash consing may avoid creating a duplicate node representing those contents. If this is applied consistently then it is sufficient to hash the four pointers to component nodes, as a bottom–up hashing of the square contents would always find those four nodes at the level below. It turns out several operations on higher level nodes can be carried out without explicitly producing the contents of those nodes, instead it suffices to work with pointers to nodes a fixed number of levels down.

===Caching and superspeed===
The quadtree can be augmented to in a node also cache the result of an update on the contents of that node. There is not enough information in a formula_4 square to determine the next timestep contents on the whole of that square, but the contents of a formula_5 square centered at the same point determine the next timestep contents of the formula_4 square. This level &quot;k&quot; node for that next timestep is offset by formula_7 cells in both the horizontal and vertical directions, so even in the case of still life it would likely not be among the level &quot;k&quot; nodes that combine into the formula_5 square, but at level &quot;k&quot;–1 the squares are again in the same positions and will be shared if unchanged.

Practically, computing the next timestep contents is a recursive operation that bottom–up populates the cache field of each level &quot;k&quot; node with a level &quot;k&quot;–1 node representing the contents of the updated center formula_9 square. Sharing of nodes can bring a significant speed-up to this operation, since the work required is proportional to the number of nodes, not to the number of cells as in a simpler representation. If nodes are being shared between quadtrees representing different timesteps, then only those nodes which were newly created during the previous timestep will need to have a cached value computed at all.

Superspeed goes further, using the observation that the contents of a formula_5 square actually determine the contents of its central formula_4 square for the next formula_12 timesteps. Instead of having a level &quot;k&quot; node cache a level &quot;k&quot;–1 node for the contents 1 step ahead, we can have it cache one for the contents formula_13 steps ahead. Because updates at level &quot;k&quot; are computed from updates at level &quot;k&quot;–1, and since at level &quot;k&quot;–1 there are cached results for advancing formula_14 timesteps, a mere two rounds of advancing at level &quot;k&quot;–1 suffice for advancing by formula_13 steps at level &quot;k&quot;.

In the worst case 2 rounds at level &quot;k&quot;–1 may have to do 4 full rounds at level &quot;k&quot;–2, in turn calling for 8 full rounds at level &quot;k&quot;–3, etc., but in practice many subpatterns in the tree are identical to each other and most branches of the recursion are short. For example the pattern being studied may contain many copies of the same spaceship, and often large swathes of empty space. Each instance of these subpatterns will hash to the same quadtree node, and thus only need to be stored once. In addition, these subpatterns only need to be evaluated once, not once per copy as in other Life algorithms. 

For sparse or repetitive patterns such as the classical glider gun, this can result in tremendous speedups, allowing one to compute &quot;bigger&quot; patterns at &quot;higher&quot; generations &quot;faster&quot;, sometimes exponentially. A generation of the various breeders and spacefillers, which grow at polynomial speeds, can be evaluated in Hashlife using logarithmic space and time.

Since subpatterns of different sizes are effectively run at different speeds, some implementations, like Gosper&#x27;s own hlife program, do not have an interactive display; they simply advance the starting pattern a given number of steps, and are usually run from the command line. More recent programs such as Golly, however, have a graphical interface that can drive a Hashlife-based engine.

The typical behavior of a Hashlife program on a conducive pattern is as follows: first the algorithm runs slower compared to other algorithms because of the constant overhead associated with hashing and building the tree; but later, enough data will be gathered and its speed will increase tremendously – the rapid increase in speed is often described as &quot;exploding&quot;.

==Drawbacks==
Like many memoized codes, Hashlife can consume significantly more memory than other algorithms, especially on moderate-sized patterns with a lot of entropy, or which contain subpatterns poorly aligned to the bounds of the quadtree nodes (i.e. power-of-two sizes); the cache is a vulnerable component. It can also consume more time than other algorithms on these patterns. Golly, among other Life simulators, has options for toggling between Hashlife and conventional algorithms.

Hashlife is also significantly more complex to implement. For example, it needs a dedicated garbage collector to remove unused nodes from the cache.

Due to being designed for processing generally predictable patterns, chaotic and explosive rules generally operate much more poorly under Hashlife than they would under other implementations.

<doc id="1095551" wikidata="Q2345785" url="?curid=1095551" title="Tina Barrett">
<text>Tina Ann Barrett (born 16 September 1976) is an English singer and actress. Her major breakthrough came in 1999 when she became a member of the pop group S Club. She has been a member of spin-off group S Club Allstars (previously &quot;S Club 3&quot;) since 2014. She is also a former member of the girl group Mis-Teeq, though she never appeared on any of their recordings.

== Early life ==
Tina Barrett was born in Hammersmith, London, England to an English father and a Guyanese mother. She was at London&#x27;s Arts Educational School for a period of eight years. Her first job was dancing in a pantomime with Lionel Blair, and was also a dancer in videos and TV performances for different music artists, most notably Pulp as a showgirl in their video for &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot;, and as an extra in the video for &quot;You&#x27;re the One I Love&quot; by Shola Ama. She was originally going to be in the group Face2Face, which later went on to become Mis-Teeq. She assisted with the group&#x27;s choreography during her time there.

== Career ==
=== 1996–1998: Mis-Teeq ===

In 1996, Barrett, Alesha Dixon and Sabrina Washington became friends in a dance studio in Fulham. The trio, named Face2Face, performed singing and dancing. The group had started work on their debut album when Barrett left to join S Club 7 after a successful audition for Simon Fuller. After her departure, the group changed their name to Mis-Teeq and replaced her with two new members, Su-Elise Nash and Zena McNally.

=== 1999–2003: S Club and hiatus ===

Barrett became a member of S Club after a series of auditions, along with members Paul Cattermole, Jon Lee, Bradley McIntosh, Jo O&#x27;Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens in 1999. During five years they released four number one singles and one number one album. They also had a series of TV shows, which were: &quot;Miami 7&quot;, &quot;L.A. 7&quot;, &quot;Hollywood 7&quot; and &quot;Viva S Club&quot;, and they also starred in a film, &quot;Seeing Double&quot;. Barrett led some of the tracks on the groups&#x27; albums, such as &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and &quot;Stronger&quot;, which was set to be a single, but was canceled when Paul Cattermole left the group. The song, along with the remixes, was eventually only released as a promotional single. Barrett co-wrote two other songs that she also led: &quot;Discotek&quot; (the B-side to the single &quot;Alive&quot;) and &quot;Secret Love&quot;, a song from the group&#x27;s final album &quot;Seeing Double&quot;. The six remaining members stayed together as &quot;S Club&quot; until 2003, when they split after releasing their greatest hits album.

When the group announced they were to break up, Barrett expressed interest in working on a solo career, but she was unsuccessful to sign with a label or an entrepreneur. She took a nine-year hiatus from her career, appearing only on red carpets and social events.

=== 2012–present: Music releases, S Club Allstars and S Club 7 reunion ===
In May 2012, a teaser video for Barrett&#x27;s debut solo single &quot;Fire&quot; was released on YouTube and a short clip of the still unfinished video was shown during an interview on &quot;LIVE!&quot;. The final version of the music video was released on 27 September 2012. Barrett announced that her debut album would be released in the end of 2013 and that she intends to tour with the album, but the album has not yet materialised. Barrett has also appeared in other music videos which include Russell Grant&#x27;s version of &quot;The Clapping Song&quot; and as the main dancer in Asian artist Navin Kundra&#x27;s song &quot;Shudaayi&quot;. Barrett is also heard in a song called &quot;Boom&quot; by Old Boy which also features rapper Nasty Jack; an accompanying music video has been shot but has not yet been released. In 2014 Barrett joined with O&#x27;Meara, McIntosh and Cattermole in the S Club 3, which became S Club Party.

In November 2014, Barrett reunited with the full group for a medley of S Club 7&#x27;s greatest hits on BBC Children in Need. Later, the group announced a sold out arena reunion tour, titled Bring It All Back 2015, which toured the UK in May 2015. Following the reunion tour, Barrett continued to perform with O&#x27;Meara and McIntosh as S Club 3. In November 2016, Barrett released the single &quot;All Fired Up&quot;. In January 2020, Barrett released &quot;Mwah Mwah&quot;, along with the music video filmed in Canada during the S Club 3 tour in the summer of 2019. When O&#x27;Meara left in 2020, she was replaced the following year by S Club 8 original member Stacey Franks, and the group was renamed &quot;S Club Allstars&quot;.

S Club 7 announced another reunion in February 2023, marking their 25th anniversary.

== Personal life ==
In March 2016, Barrett announced she was pregnant with her first child. Three months later, she gave birth to a boy.

<doc id="1095555" wikidata="Q770850" url="?curid=1095555" title="Kung Pow! Enter the Fist">
<text>Kung Pow! Enter the Fist is a 2002 American martial arts comedy film that parodies Hong Kong action cinema. Written, directed by and starring Steve Oedekerk &amp; Rudi Berden, it uses footage from the 1976 Hong Kong martial arts film &quot;Tiger &amp; Crane Fists&quot; (also called &quot;The Savage Killers&quot;) starring and directed by Jimmy Wang Yu, along with new footage shot by Oedekerk, who is also digitally inserted over Wang in many scenes, to create an original, unrelated plot.

Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a moderate box office success, grossing $17 million worldwide against a $10 million budget. It has since been considered a cult classic for its off-the-wall humor and parodying of various dubbing tropes.

==Plot==
A man, called The Chosen One by the narrator, wanders from town to town to search for the man who killed his family and tried to kill him when he was a baby. In one town, he meets Master Tang, a very ill and slightly deranged sifu, and asks Tang to help him improve his already impressive martial arts ability. Master Tang is skeptical at first, but after seeing The Chosen One&#x27;s mark (his sentient tongue, which he names Tonguey), he allows him to train at his dojo. The Chosen One is introduced to two other students: Wimp Lo, a young man who was deliberately trained incorrectly as a joke, and Ling, a young woman who has romantic feelings for The Chosen One.

While training, The Chosen One shows cartoon-like feats of strength, and Wimp Lo deems him an enemy out of jealousy. Upon learning that Master Pain, the man who killed his parents, has just arrived in town, The Chosen One prepares to confront him. Master Pain draws a crowd and demonstrates his skills. He lets his henchmen hit him repeatedly with Bō staffs all over his body and groin, then subdues them all in one move. Impressed by Master Pain&#x27;s skills, the town&#x27;s mayor hires him, and Master Pain randomly changes his name to Betty. The Chosen One attempts to train himself by letting people hit him with bō staffs, but is knocked out after being hit. When he wakes up, a mysterious one-breasted woman named Whoa warns him not to rush to fight Betty. After flirtily fighting The Chosen One, Whoa flies off into the sky.

Ignoring Whoa&#x27;s advice, The Chosen One sets off to find Betty. He comes across one of Betty&#x27;s evil companions: Moo Nieu, a Holstein cow gifted in karate, with a large udder that can shoot milk as a weapon. The Chosen One eventually incapacitates Moo Nieu by milking him until his udder is empty. He sees Betty at a waterfall and confronts him. Master Doe, Ling&#x27;s Father, shows up and tries to stop the unprepared Chosen One, and is wounded by Betty. The Chosen One takes Master Doe to Master Tang; it turns out they are old friends. However, as Tang massages Doe&#x27;s wound, it does not close and Doe dies that night. Out of depression, Ling confesses her feelings for The Chosen One.

Confused, The Chosen One journeys out to a field and consults the heavens for confidence. Suddenly Mu-Shu Fasa, a lion, appears in the sky and dispenses advice in a scene parodying a portion of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. He returns to town and finds that Betty&#x27;s hostility has expanded to the entire town, and they are killing anyone who may be his allies. He finds Wimp Lo, Ling, Master Tang and even his dog heavily maimed. However, except for Lo, they all survive. After taking Ling and his dog to safety, The Chosen One begins training himself. Discovering Betty&#x27;s weak points are the pyramid spikes embedded in his chest, The Chosen One makes wooden dummies, embeds similar spikes onto their chests and attempts to pluck them out with his bare hands. His hands are battered and he is exhausted, but after Ling treats his wounds and gives an inspiring speech, he finds himself rejuvenated and successfully pulls off the attack.

Meanwhile, Betty is called by the mysterious Evil Council and learns that The Chosen One is alive. The Chosen One confronts Betty at the temple. They fight evenly, until the Evil Council shows up revealing themselves to be French aliens, and gives Betty supernatural powers. Betty viciously beats up The Chosen One, who, in a semi-unconscious state, sees visions of Whoa and Mu-Shu Fasa giving him advice. Mu-Shu instructs him to open his mouth. As soon as he does, Tonguey flies out and attacks and destroys the mother ship, causing the entire Evil Council armada to panic and retreat, leaving Betty vulnerable. The Chosen One eventually rips the pyramid spikes out of Betty&#x27;s chest, killing him. As The Chosen One returns home with Ling, his tribulations are far from over, as presented in a trailer for a sequel, &quot;Kung Pow 2: Tongue of Fury&quot;, that immediately follows the final scene.

In a post-credits scene, Master Tang, who has been left behind, asks someone to help him from a hungry golden eagle eating his leg.

===Voiced-over characters===
In many scenes, Jimmy Wang Yu, the lead actor in &quot;Tiger &amp; Crane Fists&quot;, was replaced by Oedekerk via post-production chroma key and digital compositing techniques such as head replacement. Oedekerk also re-dubbed all of the original cast&#x27;s voices himself, inventing a different voice for every character. The only exception is the character of &quot;Whoa&quot;, who was voiced by her actress, Jennifer Tung. During filming of their scenes, Oedekerk and Tung spoke nonsensical lines, which were later re-dubbed with the correct lines from the script, in order to maintain the appearance of poorly-dubbed foreign language consistent with the rest of the film.

==Reception==
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 13% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;A short sketch&#x27;s worth of jokes stretched into a full-length feature.&quot; Metacritic reports an average score of 14 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. At the 2002 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Picture and tied with &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; for a win for Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy.

&quot;Kung Pow! Enter the Fist&quot; grossed a total of $17 million worldwide on a budget of $10 million.

==Future==

In a livestream on March 27, 2022, Oedekerk has stated that, while his original plan was for there to be a Kung Pow trilogy, discussions to make a sequel with 20th Century Studios have not worked out, as no interest was ever shown. He also stated that he has thought of making a spiritual successor to the film using Spaghetti Westerns and/or Sword-and-sandal films. No further updates have been given since.

<doc id="1095557" wikidata="Q350799" url="?curid=1095557" title="Robbie Savage">
<text>Robert William Savage (born 18 October 1974) is a Welsh former professional footballer who played as a midfielder, now a football pundit and head coach at club Macclesfield.

During his career he played predominantly as a midfielder, starting off as a youth player with Manchester United before joining Crewe Alexandra when released by the Old Trafford club. He became a regular for Leicester City in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and performed a similar role for Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers. In 2008, he joined Derby County; after a short loan spell with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion later that year, he returned to captain Derby, with whom he finished his playing career. He also played for the Wales national team on 39 occasions. He is now a pundit for the BBC and regularly presents &quot;606&quot; on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday evenings. He also co-presents &quot;Early Kick Off&quot; on BT Sport.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Wrexham, Savage started his playing career with local sides Brickfield Rangers and Lex XI. When he finished school, he joined Manchester United as a trainee and originally played as a striker. He played in the FA Youth Cup winning team of 1992, and was later given a professional contract, but never played a first-team game for the club and signed for Crewe Alexandra in 1994.

He switched into midfield early in his time at Crewe and proved himself as a competent young player, helping them reach the Division Two play-offs in his first two seasons at the club; a remarkable feat for a newly promoted club who had only played at this level twice in the previous 30 years. Crewe then made it third time lucky by sealing promotion via the play-offs in 1997. It was the first time that Crewe had reached the second tier of the English football league system, but shortly after helping Crewe win promotion, Savage handed in a transfer request to manager Dario Gradi.

===Leicester City===
 Savage was transferred to Premier League side Leicester City managed by Martin O&#x27;Neill, for a fee of £400,000, in July 1997. Savage spent five years at Leicester, where he made his name as a reliable, competitive and fiery midfielder. In 1999, Leicester reached the League Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur. In a controversial incident, Savage made a poor tackle on Tottenham&#x27;s Justin Edinburgh who retaliated by swinging his arm out. Contact was minimal, but Savage fell to the ground. Edinburgh was sent off for raising his arms, and although Tottenham went on to win the final, many Spurs fans still hold a grudge against Savage for the incident to this day. However, a year later Savage reached the League Cup final again, this time winning 2–1 against Tranmere Rovers.

===Birmingham City===
When Leicester were relegated from the Premiership at the end of the 2001–02 season he transferred to newly promoted Birmingham City for a fee of £1.25 million, signing a three-year contract. He won the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award in 2003. At the beginning of January 2005 he submitted a written request for a transfer, allegedly wishing to be nearer his ailing parents in Wrexham. On 19 January, he completed a move to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £3 million, having scored 11 goals in 82 league games for Birmingham.

===Blackburn Rovers===
In his first five months as a Blackburn player, Savage helped his new club to Premier League safety and reached the FA Cup Semi-final, a 3–0 loss to Arsenal in his homeland&#x27;s Millennium Stadium.

In March, Savage called an end to his international career after new manager John Toshack dropped him for a World Cup 2006 qualifying game against Austria. His feud with Toshack and the Welsh FA continued long into the 2005–06 season as Savage insisted he retired from international football only because Toshack told him he was not good enough to play for Wales.

In 2005–06, Savage was a regular performer for Blackburn, making 42 appearances and scoring once, against former club Birmingham. The following season, he scored against Salzburg and Wisła Kraków in Rovers&#x27; UEFA Cup campaign, but his season was cut short by a broken leg in January, which kept him out for the rest of the season.

During the 2007–08 season, Savage endured further problems with his knee, suffering a knock in the 2–1 win at Spurs after being caught by Robbie Keane. Surgery was required which kept him out of the starting lineup for six weeks. Following the return of Steven Reid to the Rovers starting lineup and some good form by David Dunn, he found it harder to get into the starting XI. Savage was well liked by the Blackburn fans and was given a standing ovation by a near capacity ground by the Rovers fans when he returned with Derby.

It was revealed by then Sunderland manager Roy Keane in his 2014 autobiography, that he had been given permission by Blackburn to sign Savage during the end of his time at Blackburn; however he was put off by Savage&#x27;s &quot;wazzupp&quot; voicemail, with Keane describing his thoughts after hearing this as &quot;I can&#x27;t be fucking signing that&quot;.

===Derby County===

On 9 January 2008, Savage joined Derby County for a fee of £1.5 million on a two-and-a-half-year contract, and later revealed that he had taken a pay cut to join Derby in his search for first-team football and had rejected a move to Sunderland because he felt Derby had wanted him more. As the number 8 shirt, which he had worn at previous clubs, was already allocated to then-captain Matthew Oakley, he took the number 44 shirt because the numbers add up to 8. He was appointed the new Derby captain after Oakley was sold to Leicester, and he skippered the Derby side in his first match, a 1–0 home defeat to Wigan Athletic.

Rumours of Savage leaving Derby came in July 2008 when he missed out on every pre-season match. In August, Leicester City chairman Milan Mandaric declared an interest in Savage, which was dismissed by Derby. Paul Jewell repeatedly left Savage out of the team, after Derby&#x27;s poor start to the 2008–2009 season, and he was replaced as captain by Alan Stubbs. Stubbs was forced to retire shortly into the new season through injury, but Savage was not considered for the role due to not being in the first team, and the armband went to Paul Connolly.

After failing to break back into the first team, Savage was sent out on loan in October to Brighton for a month to keep match fit. He would later reveal one year later, in a build-up to a match between Leicester and Derby County, that he had tried to secure a loan deal to the Walkers Stadium (Leicester had declared an interest in him months earlier). Savage even telephoned club ambassador Alan Birchenall and former teammate Paul Dickov to put in a good word with manager Nigel Pearson. Pearson, however, &quot;said no&quot;, despite Derby offering to pay &quot;90 or 95 per-cent&quot; of Savage&#x27;s wages. Following Jewell&#x27;s resignation as Derby manager, Savage found himself brought back into first team contention by new manager Nigel Clough, who made him first choice in central midfield. Savage scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 loss to Doncaster Rovers on 27 February 2009.

Savage signed a one-year extension to his Derby contract with the club on 10 August 2009 to take him through to the end of the 2010–11 season. The next day, he was named in the Championship Team of the Week for his performance in the opening day victory over Peterborough United. Later that month, Savage was renamed as Captain of Derby County, replacing Paul Connolly, who manager Nigel Clough wanted to &quot;concentrate on his own game&quot;. In response, Savage said that: &quot;I did not deserve the captaincy when I first came to the club. I was handed it from the first day and I shouldn&#x27;t have been. It was too much pressure for me and I had a nightmare. I let it get to me. I think I&#x27;m ready for it now. I feel more comfortable with it now.&quot; Derby struggled once again during the season, not achieving safety until the 44th fixture, but the season was a personal success for Savage as he appeared in all but one of Derby&#x27;s 51 league and cup fixtures during the campaign, the match which he missed being due to suspension, starting 49 of them. He also scored twice; a free kick against Queens Park Rangers in a 4–2 home defeat and a volley at Sheffield United in a 1–1 draw. He also won the club&#x27;s own Player of the Year award but lost out on the fan&#x27;s award to Shaun Barker.

Savage again started in the Derby first XI in the 2010–11 season in a new 4–2–3–1 formation around new signing James Bailey, though Derby got off to a poor start winning just one of their opening seven league games, with Savage&#x27;s form making fans question the justification for his place in the team and his status as skipper. He made his 100th appearance for the club in a 2–2 draw against Queens Park Rangers before he was dropped to the bench for a 1–1 draw at Barnsley, the first game he had played no part in for Derby (barring unavailability for selection) since Nigel Clough&#x27;s arrival as manager in January 2009.

Savage played in goal for Derby on 11 March 2010, when Stephen Bywater was taken off with a back injury against Reading. He let in two goals during his 45 minutes in the Derby goal.

On 16 October 2010, Savage played his 600th career match in a 3–0 victory on Preston North End, scoring an injury-time penalty to seal the win. In January 2011, Savage revealed that he was considering leaving the club for a move to Vancouver Whitecaps, Savage stating: &quot;One thing is for sure, I will be leaving Derby County at the end of the season, if not before, even if they offer me a new contract. My time is up here. I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with Derby and I want to walk away with my head held high&quot;. One fan responded by telephoning Savage during an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live and telling him to &quot;leave the club now&quot; and &quot;take young Mr. Clough with him&quot;. Savage eventually rejected the move, stating it was too big a move for his family. On 31 January 2011, Savage announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season to concentrate on his growing media career. In his last two games, a home loss against Bristol City and an away defeat at Reading, he was met with a round of applause and a standing ovation from both sets of supporters.

===Stockport Town===
On 24 November 2019, Savage came out of retirement to join Stockport Town of the North West Counties League. He made his league debut for the club the following evening, as an 80th-minute substitute in a 3–2 victory over FC Oswestry Town. That was his only appearance.

==International career==
Savage played at under-18 and under-21 level for Wales before making his senior international debut in 1995 against Albania while at Crewe. Savage attained 39 caps, scoring two goals, both in World Cup qualifying against Turkey and Norway, before retiring from international football in September 2005, saying he wished to concentrate on his club career. However, many people believe the reason he quit was due to a spat with Wales manager John Toshack. Savage did give the explanation that &quot;John Toshack said it was my way or the highway – well I&#x27;m on the M56.&quot;

On 6 March 2006, he appeared on Welsh radio, partaking in a debate with pundit Leighton James over his exclusion from the Wales squad. Early in his international career he clashed with former Wales manager Bobby Gould when he jokingly threw a replica of Paolo Maldini&#x27;s shirt into a disposal bin before a match against Italy. Savage was initially dropped by Gould from the squad only to be reinstated the next day.

==Style of play and controversies==

Savage&#x27;s style as a midfield player was all-action and energetic, and he regularly collected yellow cards, and for a while held the dubious distinction of being awarded the most yellow cards of any Premiership player in the league&#x27;s history – 89, although he has now been overtaken by Lee Bowyer, Kevin Davies and Paul Scholes. Fans of Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Arsenal have accused him of simulation, whether to win a set piece or to get an opponent red carded.

During a match against Newcastle United in August 2003, the referee Matt Messias swung his arm out and accidentally hit Savage in the face as Savage was running behind him. On 17 January 2010, whilst commentating for BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s coverage of a Premier League match between Aston Villa and West Ham United at Villa Park, a clearance by Villa midfielder Stiliyan Petrov hit Savage in the face causing some minor bleeding to the nose.

Savage has, however, only been sent off twice in his career: once during an international game for the Welsh national team, and once during a Premier League game for Blackburn. He received his first-ever red card when he was sent off in Wales&#x27; World Cup qualification match against Northern Ireland in September 2004 for reacting to a foul on him by midfielder Michael Hughes. Both Hughes and Savage were sent off, but, on later review, the punishment of Savage seemed harsh to some. Savage was ridiculed for threatening to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights over the decision. His once-impressive statistic of never being sent off in a Premiership match ended on 18 March 2006 when he was dismissed against Middlesbrough for two bookable offences. Both were controversial – the first for a challenge on George Boateng where he appeared to take the ball, and the second for handball when it seemed unintentional. Savage later admitted that he was probably due a controversial sending off because he had escaped punishment for illegal challenges in the past.

One famous example of his eccentric behaviour was while he played for Leicester City. In an incident to become known as &quot;Poogate&quot; he used the referee&#x27;s toilet before a game, claiming he had an upset stomach due to the effects of prescribed antibiotics. He lost his appeal against The Football Association&#x27;s decision to fine him £10,000, and Leicester fined him two weeks&#x27; wages for the incident.

Whilst playing for Leicester, in the final minute of a league game against rivals Derby at Pride Park in 2001, Savage dived in the penalty area. Leicester were awarded the penalty, which was converted, and meant they won the game 3–2. Savage&#x27;s blatant dive, his hopeful look at the referee and his aggressive fist-pumping celebration in front of the home fans resulted in a torrent of abuse from the fans and in Savage being chased across the pitch by incensed Derby players, two of whom were booked. Derby fans regularly booed, jeered and abused Savage whenever he played against them, and when he became a Derby player in January 2008, he was treated with a mixture of hostility and indifference, partly over the incident, and partly over his average form.

Savage is also famous for an incident at Villa Park, while playing for Birmingham City, in a bad-tempered Second City derby in March 2003. After a slide tackle on him by Dion Dublin, a confrontation between the two and several other players occurred before Dublin headbutted Savage. Dublin was then sent off by referee Mark Halsey as result. Birmingham would go on to win the derby 0–2.

When being interviewed by BBC Radio Derby&#x27;s Colin Gibson in January 2010, Savage reacted furiously to rumours he heard that the Derby players think the club&#x27;s backroom staff are not up to the job. These rumours were brought up during a phone-in on Gibson&#x27;s show on the station the preceding weekend, following the Rams&#x27; 4–1 defeat at home to Scunthorpe United on 9 January.

==Broadcasting career==
Savage occasionally acted as a pundit during his club career, and started working in the media more regularly in the 2009–10 season. He worked in a number of different punditry roles during the 2010 FIFA World Cup before joining the presenting team for BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s 6-0-6 show. In September 2010, Savage signed up as official sporting ambassador for bookmakers William Hill. In May 2011 he was awarded the Sony Radio Academy Rising Star Award, as well as winning an award from the Plain English Campaign.

Between 2009 and 2013, Savage was a pundit on ESPN, and has since moved to TNT Sports.

Since retiring from football in May 2011, Savage has attempted to become a more prominent broadcasting figure beyond punditry. From September 2011 Savage took part in the 2011 series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, partnering Ola Jordan. The show broadcast on 22 October saw Savage perform a dramatic knee-slide towards the camera, which resulted in a broken nose. Savage and Jordan were eliminated from the competition in the quarterfinal on 4 December 2011, placing sixth.

In October 2012, along with 463 other players, Savage took part in BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s attempt to set a new Guinness World Record for the &#x27;most players in a continuous 5 a side exhibition match&#x27;. This was for BBC Children in Need along with comedian Lloyd Langford and BBC Radio 5 Live travel reporter Lindsey Chapman. Along with Ex-England cricketer Andrew Flintoff, Savage is part of a BBC Radio 5 Live podcast called &quot;Flintoff, Savage &amp; The Ping Pong Guy&quot;, hosted by former table tennis player Matthew Syed, which discussed current sporting topics.

==Club management==
Savage&#x27;s involvement with Stockport Town led to him becoming involved with the creation of phoenix club Macclesfield F.C. in October 2020. Macclesfield owner Robert Smethurst appointed Savage as a member of the board (later director of football) with Danny Whitaker as manager. On 30 August 2021, Macclesfield defeated local rivals Congleton Town 1–0 in the NWCFL Premier Division; the match was suspended for several minutes late in the second half due to crowd trouble, during which Savage intervened to break up fighting.

On 17 June 2024, Robbie Savage was appointed head coach at Macclesfield.

==Personal life==
Savage was born in Wrexham on 18 October 1974, to Colin and Valerie Savage. He attended Ysgol Bryn Alyn in Gwersyllt until he completed his GCSE studies in July 1991. On leaving school, Savage joined Manchester United as an apprentice.

Savage and his wife Sarah have two sons. In 2012 one of his sons, Charlie, was attached to Manchester United&#x27;s youth academy and in April 2021 he signed his first professional contract with the club. On 8 December 2021, Savage provided commentary for BT Sport in the match where his son Charlie made his senior Manchester United debut in the UEFA Champions League, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–1 draw against Young Boys. 

Robbie Savage&#x27;s father was diagnosed with Pick&#x27;s disease, a dementia-type illness, when he was in his mid-50s, and died in 2012. Savage is an ambassador for the dementia care and research charity, the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society.

Savage had said in the future he would have liked to finish his career at home town club Wrexham before going on to manage them. He also said that the greatest regret of his football career was not signing for Everton when he had the chance in 2005.

Savage published a biography in 2011, &quot;Savage!&quot;, written with Janine Self, and in 2015 published &quot;I&#x27;ll Tell You What...&quot;, a book of memoir and punditry.

In October 2014, Savage was awarded an honorary fellowship at Wrexham&#x27;s Glyndŵr University for services to sport.
